1,Just an Ad for His Audio Tapes,"This book is written in a very simplistic and self-congratulatory manner, like advertising copy. Although photos of body postures are given, no music is written out, and the student is directed to purchase his audio tapes or CD's, with a $100 price tag for the set."
3,Essays on People and Technology,"Professor Norman is one heck of a writer. I almost forgot to go to bed one night due to voraciously reading this book. Only the running out of the four candles that gave me light to read on the unelectrified summer cottage alerted me to the fact that it was well past two o'clock in the morning and it would be advisable to catch some shuteye. And TSAFEA is not Donald A. Norman's best book by far. Actually this book has been edited from essays and common sense columns written by Professor Norman and most of the issues are already familiar from the Psychology of Everyday Things and Things That Make Us Smart. Nevertheless I will be more than happy to recommend this book for my software designer friends in the future.The most interesting chapters discuss social characteristics of machines and how a machine and its user, for example a car and its driver, form a (social) unit."
5,This is a dated but seminal book on sustainable development,"This is one of the few books, along with Careless Technology, Silent Spring, The Limits to Growth and others that really clarified the approach of humankind to nature. It is not a critique of modern technology or society, but an early and valuable presentation of the ecological consequences of human activities throughout history. I thoroughly recommend this book to any students of environmental studies or development issues."
2,Man's role in changing the Face of the Earth,"This book is a collection of papers written by various authors; most PHD canidates? The listed authors of the book are only the editors. This is no reflection on the vendor. The book I recieved was as described; I did not find it very helpful in my studies and it certianly ain't a fun read, Eh?"
5,Sky Walking Reaches High on Many Accounts,"This is a highly readable and expertly written account by Tom Jones about his astronaut career.He writes from his heart, and has clearly thought a lot about how to effectively communicate his experiences.His use of imagery puts this book in the realm of literature, though it is definitely non-fiction.A must for your Christmas list if you are or once were an aspiring astronaut, an aspiring writer of topics related to space and technology or just interested in knowing what it is like up there. It is a great read; I laughed, I cried, learned something about space, space policy and history, and was amazed by it all!"
1,Makes space flight dull and boring,"Not the Right Stuff for me.The writing is wordy, attempts to be profound and ""educated"" at every turn, and fails.His single most dramatic story, the stuck hatch, is anti-climatic.His second most dramatic story: too much air getting into the food packets.There is very little ""inside scoop"" here, as NASA is portrayed as all glorious, and almost perfect. Yet we know, and see demonstrated on a regular basis, that the opposite is true.Find this locally if you can, and browse through it first to see if its the right stuff for you."
5,",Good NASA book",This was a book that I had heard Tom Jones talking about on a radio interview. I sounded like the perfect thing for my NASA freak. He loved it.As with most items from Amazon it came on time and in good shape.
3,Intriguing,"The name of the artist and the album really took my interest. I have heard other music of this type that really spoke to me, just not this album."
4,An entertaining look at 90s college rock,"While I can't vouch for the film 'A Matter Of Degrees', the related soundtrack has gathered together a bunch of semi-legendary 'left-of-the-dial' alternative rock artists from Pixies to Lemonheads to Miracle Legion and more on one cd. All thirteen tracks are listenable enough, and- although tone and lyrics vary- I love this offbeat kind-of feeling that pervades this collection. In particular, ""Evergreen Memorial Drive"" by Nova Mob (i.e. the fantastic Gary Hart formerly of Husker Du) and ""Where is my Mind?"" by the Pixies stand out. For people of a previous generation, I guess this is a look back to their 90s days in nostalgia. But for anyone else, it's a nice trip."
3,Trying to sound like Radiohead much?,Still a good listen and worth picking up if you are a fan of the band.
4,Devil Iconography,"While I have almost completed this book, I am finding Mr. Link's research on the subject to be quite thorough. I enjoy obtaining knowledge which has been covered from all possible perspectives. One problem...What does the word ""psychostasy"" mean? One example of it's use is on page 117. I have looked in my own dictionary and online in Encarta, and have found no definitions. Anyone?hatrick@texas.net"
4,Sham - pooh! ... not that that's a bad thing!,"Wasn't sure about R.I.D to begin with, mainly because they sound a bit like Shampoo at times, but this album's a grower.Best of their 3 CDs in my opinion, Turn it Up and DJ's got a Gun are the stand out tracks for me.If you like 80's synth pop, and modern takes on the genre (Chromeo, Har Mar etc ..), you'll love this."
1,"Djeez, get yourselves 2gether!","One good song (La nuit) on a terrible album. This has nothing to do with proper electronic sounds; to be compared with Miss Kittin is a downright insult to Miss Kittin herself.This album is a good example of uninspired musicians trying to ride along with the electro hype currently invading Europe.If you're looking for wellproduced albums, try Fischerspooner, The Hacker, Anthony Rother, DJ Hell, or the real deal in electropop: Vive La Fte."
5,Moving Story about Zora Hurston as a Girl,"This story is biographical in nature and relates a time in Zora Hurston's life when her mother died of cancer. Zora was raised by her mother to be more independent that most girls were at the time and had to oppose her father who feared she would be a tomboy. She listened mainly to her mother and participated in many activities barred to girls. Her mother dies when she is young and in order to continue some level of independence, she tries to carry her mother's teachings in her memory and heart. Recommended."
5,Our Only 4 term President and the Wife who made it Possible,"Excellent history of Eleanor, her childhood which was difficult because her wonderful mother died when Eleanor was 8 years old. Her father, Elliott Roosevelt, brother of President Theodore was an alcoholic and ineffective as a father. Eleanor was raised by her maternal grandparents, the Halls who lived in a mansion in Tivoli N.Y. on the Hudson River. Eleanor grew up to be a woman of deep intellect and great charm. Franklin relied on her advice when making major decisions. They had marital problems because of his dalliances but there was a lot of love and understanding because they had the common goal of serving the country with honesty and loyalty during the depression years and during World War II."
3,Mostly Eleanor & some Franklin,would have been a better title for this book. Slow in some parts. I believe you really have to have an interest in Mrs. Roosevelt to get through it. She was truly FDR's most important advisor. Not becauses he wanted it that way but others in his administration would defer to her. The book talks about many of her back door power plays to the annoyance of the president. These are amusing stories but too infrequent.
3,from back cover,"302 pages.This intriguing study of the fascinating science of mathematics contains answers to hundreds of puzzling questions, questions such as - why is the day divided into 24 hours? are parallel line really parallel? does 1 plus 1 always equal 2? The autho shows how the basic principles of mathematics solve the mysteries of everyday objects and occurences. And he reveals how this important science is an integrl part of all the knowledge man has gained about this world"
2,Ok,"Encouraging, but I've read better books. It's cheap enough though that I'm satisfied with it. I'll probably give it to our local library so someone else can enjoy it."
5,Swamp Pop - The Heart of Louisiana,"I have long known of Louisiana's rich and eclectic musical history, but never experienced it first-hand. Recently, I moved to Louisiana and have had the opportunity to learn more about the local music in person. In that regard, I can say that if you are looking for a CD that captures the home-grown sound of Louisiana, this is the CD for you. ""Swamp Pop Brew"" is as unique and special as the state from which it comes. I highly recommend it."
5,x-men at its hieght,"if you dont know what this is, it is when apocolypse tries to kill All the mutants by using unbeatable tactics. he first scapegoats the mutants for caarying a certain plague that he created and spead to both humans and mutants. the x-men must travel to the future, meet up with bishop, who is a time traveler like cable (first seen in episode 6: slave island). Finding out how they died, the x-men must then go back in time and prevent apocalypse from taking over the earth! After seeing this, you will be begging for part 2 of this series. As an x-men fan, i love each of the videos and sub-series, and i reccomend them all to you, but this one and the Phoenix saga stick out in my brain as the best of the best."
5,seems fine!,Haven't used it yet--I'm assuming it is fine. It arrived quickly and was securely (but not ridiculously) packaged. I am totally satisfied with this vendor.
1,not worth any amount of $$$,"I own the first three albums camouflage put out. After listening to this cd I stopped following the band. With this album they've abandoned every aspect of why I liked them in the first place. When the they first appeared on the scene they were doing ""depeche mode"" better than the band itself. This cd is garbage and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone no matter what kind of musical taste you have. Stick with ""voices & images"" or""methods of silence"" and pass this one by!"
4,Subtle Camouflage,"The Depeche Mode sound a like Camouflage is here with their third album Meanwhile. This is a very good album. The music is more subtle and acoustic than what the band has experimented with in their previous two albums, but is very nice. In fact, I think this album is better than their previous Methods of Silence album. Tracks worth checking out are Heaven I Want You, Handsome, This Day, and Bittersweet. Camouflage is the best Depeche Mode wannabe group of the several electronic inspired bands that are out there."
5,The Shape of Synthpop,"I became hooked on ""synthpop"" during the middle-late '70s. I have continued to listen to similar forms of music since then, deveiating into contemporary ""techno pop"" or ""electronica"". I sense the references of Camouflage to Depeche Mode and Erasure. I find that they coincidently occupy the same space; they present ""sound shapes"" that are incredibly similar. Perhaps there is in fact a genre here in the form of music they compose? Can we admit that at least?"
2,Not good........,"I am a big camouflage fan. I love ""voices and images"" and ""methods of silence"".I was expecting something similar and got something else.I couldnt believe that they changed their talent and style to this.Bad lyrics and music. The only good song worth listening is the first song. What ever happend to the dark synth sounds that made Camouflage stand out like the Depeche Mode????? Big disappointment."
4,Bizarre.....,"I have never quite figured out what Camouflage was trying to do with this album. It is really nothing like its predecessors ""Voice & Images"" and ""Methods Of Silence"" They all but abandoned the Depeche Mode-like synth pop in favor of a more acoustic, more experimental sound. Vocalist Marcus Meyn changes his singing style as well, with a more aggressive, rawer tone. All in all, though, it is a very rich and satisfyingly unique album. Only a few of the songs fall short, sometimes sounding a bit ""quirky"" at times, which is my only minor criticism of this album."
4,Songs from an Angel,"Although my take on this release was that CG was heavily pressured by Atlantic Records to sound more like Motley Crue, they delivered a CD that had some really good songs. ""Make You Love Me"" has to be the suckiest. ""Song For Angels"", ""Love and Dreams"", ""In the Mood"", and ""Far Away"" are my favorites. ""Midnight"", God rest his soul, delivered on so many levels. He is missed and his music will live on forever in my heart and mind.R.I.P. John Patrick McDonald (""Midnight""). You are missed deeply."
4,"Superb singing, annoying accent in places","This well-known Finnish chamber choir really know what to do with this material in order to create the multi-layered, mystical atmosphere suggested by Penderecki's score with occasional outbursts of dramatic expressivity. A very well-balanced choir with wonderful choral voices.Sadly, in some places, their Finnish accent breaks through in a way that suggests someone should have paid some extra attention to pronounciation before recording (Stabat matEEEEr).In all other ways, though, this record is very well worth owning. A great perfomance."
1,great,"they were fun except hard to keep them tied and played with them so much i wore off the wheeles, and the wheeles feel off."
2,Don't bother.,"My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them. She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly. The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these."
5,Learning current dance moves,My sister wanted DVDs to learn how to dance like Michael Jackson and Britney Spears. I couldn't find any so I got this and she seemed happy with them.
3,It would be nice,It would be very nice to be able to hear a few of the cuts likeother musicians pages allow. I am looking for one particular song and this doesn't help at all.
2,Incredibly poor build quality.,"At first glance this distribution block seemed suitable. However, after inspecting the unit more carefully I found that the gold plating does not extend all the way into the holes. So, where my wire would make contact against the block it looks all corroded and poorly machined (or cast). This was enough for me not to use it for my application. It is one of those things that looks nice online but once you get it you are instantly reminded of what you get for $6. I would recommend buying a name brand for a little more money."
1,Maybe his next book!,"Sorry, just couldn't get into the flo of the book. The price for what the writer offers was a tad much! The characters are boring, the plot is boring and, sorry to say, but do yourself a favor and pass on this one! Maybe the writer's next book will be better! I, for one, can only hope!"
4,ONE OUTSTANDING SONG!,"I actually bought this particular album for ONE SONG....""If It Weren't For Him""! It used to get radio play in the 1980's and was one of my favorite of Vince Gill's songs. I didn't buy the album it was on back then and, years later, when I decided to look for an album with this specific song, I couldn't find it! Needless to say, when I finally found this album on amazon.com, I was surprised and very pleased!After listening to the entire album, I must say that, except for the above-named song, this will not be a favorite album on the WHOLE because I have always enjoyed Vince's ballads the most!I am, however, so happy to have the ONE SONG which has long been the object of my search!"
5,Comfortable and Professional!,Bianchi makes the best security and police gear that is on the market and affordable. Full STX basketweave and the hoop and loop buckleless inner lock makes this belt a great investment and very comfortable.
3,heavy duty belt,Its a great belt. But i didnt realize how wide the belt was. cant use it with any of my pants.
2,A good story badly told,"Pozner was a prominent journalist at the time of the coup that ousted Gorbachev and he gives a good account of the events of those days on the barricades, but he has a tendency to engage in far too many flashbacks and always at the most inoportune moments. If he had stuck with a linear narrative, and left out about half of the tongue twisting names (you'll need an Excel spreadsheet to keep all the minor players straight), it could have been an excellent book."
1,a word of caution,"To have this nincompoop offer an exegesis of the collapse of the Soviet Union is tantamount to having Kenny Gee explain harmonic patterns in Charlie Parker's ""Bopology"". There are plenty of serious books on the subject, incidentally twoAmerican authors Stephen Cohen and Peter Reddaway present serious socio/economical/political analyses, understanding of multifarious cultural phenomena, and above all else a sincere empathy for the plight of the Russian people.It would be appropriate here to recall a thinker who had the most profound knowledge of this enigmatic (pardon the cliche) country, the father of ""containment policy"" George Kennan. Pozner's statement that Russia's conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity was a tragic mistake that had thwarted the development of the Russian polity says it all - ignorance and rabid russophobia. Pozner has always had an uncanny ability at temporizing, both in the days of the good old comrades and in the free-for-all kleptocracy."
2,bird guard,"this was so cheap I had to try it but it doesn't work. If it had a part to hook under the cage to catch and keep the seeds, maybe, but its too short to do any good and it keeps falling down. I had to hot glue it to the cage."
1,This product is useless!,I bought this from store and thought I'd give it a try. Well I'm sorry I did. The velcro tabs don't stay on. They literally fell right off after I put them on. My birds still get seed all over my floor. I will never buy this product again!
2,Twilight Musings,"Hi. Do you know if my poem is in the book you have The Colors of Life? It is called ""If You Sit""I didn't see your poem in my book Twilight Musings. If it makes you feel better my sister's poem isn't in there either and I paid $49.95 hoping both ours would be in there together."
4,I do not like this book.,"The text is one of the finest I've seen; However, there are not enough excercises, and there is no warning as to whether the problems relate to the text or are problems for further study. It's all right to have problems that are extensions of theory, but some of these problems are something else entirely."
4,Pre-WW2 theories on tank warfare,"This is a short book, written by one of the foremost Panzergenerals, before WW2 began. He describes the militarypotential of the tank as an offensive weapon. It is mainlyof interest as a view of the formative period in which theconcept of the Blitzkrieg was being developed."
5,Magnifico,"Es una de las principales fuentes para el desarrollo de mi pagina sobre la Segunda Guerra Mundial; para una persona dedicada el estudio de la estrategia del empleo de las unidades acorazadas, llena plenamente las expectativas."
4,Not just about Armored Warfare,"There is much value in this work from a historical and professional point of view. To say, however, that this is a book simply about the development of armored forces is a shallow view. The historical vignettes are excellemt; Guderian also describes how technology outran the thought process for integration and employment of armored forces---the technology and equipment changed but the tactics didn't. I found his logic and thought process applicable to today's gap between technology and our race to understand and use it efficiently."
4,A Must For Serious Military Historians,"The development of armoured warfare in the 20th century simply cannot be fully understood without reading this book. Guderian's writing style is terse yet lucid, and his analysis is superb and easy to follow. The lessons that he deduces from armoured combat in the First World War are as applicable today as they were then. For a true military historian, an opportunity to follow the thought process of such an influential soldier is priceless. It is especially eye-opening in light of the prevalent, Anglocentric view of W.W.I tank development. Guderian's analysis gives far more credit to the French military than any contemporary historian would imagine."
3,Tough Read,"""Vigorous writing is consice""--Guderian is not. Compound his verbose style with an awkward translation that suffers from poor editing (which gets worse after the first chapter), and what would otherwise be a gem of military history becomes a chore to read. Needs a lot of copy editing. I hope this was addressed in the 1999/Cassell version."
2,Not dryer friendly,"Looked like a nice shirt, but comes out wrinkled from the dryer.I don't recommend this shirt unless you want to iron polos."
2,Too small - what happened?,"I've been wearing XLs from all the other retailers for years, but this last order - they literally choked! Not good at all, had to discard the two I bought."
5,After The Heat,"""The Bell Dog"" is the song I remember being played years ago on the radio. The rest of the album is quite interesting too!"
4,out of body experience,drink family size bottle of robitussin dm with water or saltines after wait one hour put on any eno close eyes and tripp trust me it works
4,A good laugh for moms!,"Thirty-something prima donna Lara Stone is in for a big surprise when she brings her new baby girl home from the hospital and discovers that having a baby is, well, work.Overwhelmed by the relentless baby-tending schedule, lack of sleep, and loss of control, Lara struggles to hold on to her pre-baby life. She finds herself competing with her nanny, worrying that her husband is on the verge of an affair, and freaking out when her long-lost father appears on her doorstep and announces his engagement to the likes of Heidi Fleiss.But when she makes an unlikely new friend, Lara finally learns to let go, trust her own instincts, and find a new kind of happiness.Tales from the Crib guarantees a good laugh for any mom who has ever felt helpless, clueless, or in the running for Worst Mom of the Year.Armchair Interviews says: Perfect for passing around the playgroup."
3,Not half bad,"At first I thought ""not another chick-lit waste of paper"" but this book was a pleasant beach read. It is silly and harmless fluff."
3,"Good writing, but.......","This book was fun, entertaining, and well-written. However, the main character is a little whiny, self-obsessed, vain, and insecure. And most of all, her privileged baby situation evoked no sympathy from me. She whines and cries about how hard everything is, while she has a live-in maid and housekeeper, money for $600 pairs of shoes, lost her baby weight in like 2 seconds, has a husband who puts up with her extreme bitchiness, and a 6-month maternity leave from her job. Please. There are thousands of woman who raise one or two babies without all the fancy trappings, and THAT'S hard. I don't want to hear about the poor little rich girl's life. If the author would have spent less time trying to get the reader to sympathize with her main character who's life really isn't that awful, I would have enjoyed it more."
4,Cute!,"Read (and loved) the first book and this one -- following heroine Lara Stone's initial adjustment to mommy-hood -- did not disappoint. Cute! For me -- some of the wacky subplots distracted a bit from the sheer hilarity, but a great read nonetheless."
1,it has been a month and still no book.,Delivery date was aug. 13 to sept. 3 and it is sept. 8 and still no book. WTF.
1,poor quality,I followed the instructions on the package. I placed the mug in the freezer for no more than 10mins and it cracked.
5,ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM THE PRINCE OF GOSPEL,THIS CD IS AWESOME. I GOT IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. I LOVE IT. JOHN P KEE IS AN AWESOME SINGER AND PRODUCER. THIS CD JUST SHOWS THAT. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS THEN YOU NEED TO GET IT BECUASE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. I LOVE THIS CD. EVERY SONG IS GOOD AND ITS MINISTERS TO MY HEART. YOU REALLY ARE BEING BLESSED WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THIS.
4,Late to the party,"This album came a little late to the party. A decent album though. Best song is ""Wake Me Up"" (written by Poison's Bret Michaels). ""So Many Seasons"" is a song about Stevie losing his Father & Brother within a month of each of each other. Good Ballads on this one. I grew up w/ Stevie and he really wanted to put this album out for a long time. Just a little too late. A few years earlier, I think they would have had a hit. Also, check out Vain, great band from Lake Tahoe, Nv. (based in San Francisco)"
2,pseudo-intellectual nonsense,"I watched this movie with all the anticipation of someone who had heard stellar reviews from professionals and friends alike. As a huge fan of art film, I was prepared to watch it and declare a new favorite.To say the least, I was disappointed.This is a self-indulgent journey into the mind of a self-important writer who fancies himself in the same league as Aristotle by asking questions that might as well be, ""Is that a reflection of myself in the mirror, or is the real world going on inside the mirror and I'm merely the reflection?""Philosphy for 3rd graders, I suppose.This is absurdity at its most inflated and self-aggrandizing. The method of animating live-action film is the only innovative feature here, and it's really rather pointless, unless you buy into what the makers are selling, in which case it you would consider it pure genius, i'm sure.I gave it 2 stars simply because it's at least an attempt at something important. Unfortunately, it falls very, very short."
5,Food for Thought.....or not,"This movie is anything but conventional. If your looking for a plot here, you're in the wrong movie theatre. Instead just imagine if someone was able to film an entire two hour dream sequence and bring it back intact and you can buy it. Would you? And if not, why not? And when am I going to stop asking you questions? I....Don't...Know.This movie has some great heady dialogue, and I would think that it could turn some people off right away. If you mind is shallow as a kiddie pool and you don't know how to swim, it would be best to stay away from these waters. If you enjoyed ""What The Bleep Do We Know"", this movie gives another slant on that."
2,Interesting animation technique but nothing else,"The 'story' is non-existent, only following one guy around as he goes from place to place wandering aimlessly. I do not exaggerate. What follows is nothing more than over-intellectualized psycho-babble about the meaning of life. Heavy on the babble. Heavy on the psycho. Only 2-3 snippets, as far as I remember, featured ""the common man""'s plight... The conversations didn't even spark my interest in the subject matter because it all sounded so pretensious. A perfectly intolerable film. Avoid this one."
4,"Very Original- A Prototype For ""A Scanner Darkly""","The ideas presented in this movie definitely don't come up in ordinary daily conversation. It makes you question your reality in a way that ""The Matrix"" and ""What The Bleep Do We Know?"" do. There were several animators working on the film, each working on a different scene, which made it more interesting. One or two of the animation styles, however, were simplistic to the point that they ""pulled me out"" of the movie. Fans of more ""traditional"" Western or Japanese animation, or of comic books, might like Linklater's latest film, A Scanner Darkly, a bit more."
5,Eye-opening. Wake up and watch.,"Now, here's something you don't see every day. Waking Life is a movie that isn't afraid to be smart, but it manages to be sexy at the same time. And the painstakingly crafted visuals are guaranteed to keep you watching long enough to - gasp! - actually have an original thought or two by the time you're all done.Imagine you're dreaming, and you know you're dreaming, but you can't seem to wake up. What would you do? In the world of Waking Life, you'd free your mind, that's what. The twenty or so teachers you'll encounter here each have a unique message to share. You'll meditate on death, contemplate the future of human evolution, and reject your plateau. And if you do get around to waking up, things may never be the same.If you're into movies where the person who changes the most at the end is you and not the protagonist, you won't wanna miss Waking Life.It's a series of holy moments, if you're looking closely."
4,Absolutely Incredible,"An insightful look into the abstract human mind. The movie basically consists of the main character moving throughout a dream, discussing theories of all of life's complexities and mysteries with random people. This is not a movie for the narrow-minded, thinking outside the box is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie.In addition to heavy abstract intellectual themes, the visual technique, called rotoscoping, creates a dreamlike, ""other worldly"" feel to the movie.The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it is slightly difficult to follow in the beginning, though it does get progressively easier. Highly recommended."
3,a good movie,"i liked this movie i thought the animation could have used a little more work and unless you are really into the whole emo artsy fartsy political ""down with the government"" movement movies you probably won't like this movie"
5,Waking Life,"A movie that looks at the more interesting, magical (for lack of a better word) side of life."
4,Interesting times with Waking Life,"This movie was originaly recommended to me by a college friend while discussing mild-altering experiences. After seeing it, I now understand why. This movie is an exercise in expanding your mind. It's pretty much one long trip through different ""conversations"" the main character is pressumably having regarding how we view our world and what that means. We're never sure exactly how these conversations are taking place and why the main character moves from person to person, but each one tells us something about how we understand our waking/dreaming time. Again, as this movie was recommended during conversations about shrooms and pot, I wasn't sure what to expect but now I have to thank my friend. If you've ever wondered about reality and dreams, this movie shows you you're not alone. It also puts forth some pretty convincing arguments in between interesting stories about life's little quirks."
1,Too much dialogue!,"While ""Waking Life"" is truly visually innovative, its animation is truly lost on the surplus of dialogue that fills the movie. The dream-like segues between conversations are certainly the high points of the film, if the hapless movie-goer can stay awake through the proselytizing, pretentious, overly trendy and post-modern pseudo-philosophy."
1,"PHILOSOPHY CLASS ON FILM, AND JUST AS BORING","This film isn't impressive. I spent four years in college, got my fill of classic and contemporary philosophy, and now I watch it in an animated format.The animation didn't make it more interesting.To make a film like this....go to a university, film a philosophy professor ranting on about whatever he knows and offers, send it thru some art program on your apple, and voila...you have WAKING LIFE.Snore.mike"
5,Fantasia without the music - a hypnotic film,"This film is so visually stunning, I don't have the words to describe it. I highly recommend seeing it. It will leave you speechless. Beautifully presented."
3,Movie made me sick,"I read a lot about lucid dreaming, etc. but this movie sucked. The motion of the picture makes you feel nautious, like seasickness. The story line is pretty lame, and annoying. It was a poorly executed idea, at best."
2,Intro To Philosophy- Reason and Reality 101,"From Skepticism to Determinism...For anyone who wants to take a two hour crash course on philosophy... knock yourself out. I will say that the visual work and music in this movie were excellent;however, the constant philosophical conversation shoved down my throat was enough to make me want to throw it back up."
5,Amazing Movie.,"After a few friends suggested I watch this movie, I was blown away. It is a truly great movie. The animation style is awesome and interesting (same style as a Scanner Darkly, which was also done by Linklater.) It explores the concept of reality and dreams. Are in a sense sleep walking through life or dream walking. This is a movie that you should watch multiple times to soak in all the gems prevalent throughout. It's a great foray into different types and topics of philosophy. Be warned if you don't like philosophy or philosophical conversations, this movie isn't for you (As one reviewer didn't like the philosophy ""Shoved down his throat""). It is alot to take in at first and worth the repeated viewings."
5,A masterpiece of truth-telling artistry...,"Visually delicious and innovative, yes, but never mind: this is a masterpiece of truth-telling artistry.Puts the first glimpses of the young sage under a well-focused pop culture macroscope, and every seeker i know who saw it wanted to watch it on infinite loop.Gentle warning: this film requires extra humility from people who think they don't have any big lessons left to learn, extra patience from those who get restless sitting still and listening, and extra courage from those who are so jaded that they resist being stirred to dream of awakening."
2,Too full of themselves,While some of the information was good and interesting almost all of the characters talked like they were so sure of themselves and their opinions were the only right ones.
5,Watch This,You probably have not seen this but you should!! It is so creative and interesting. If you like thinking you will like this movie.
1,Suitable for late night phone calls in junior high,"First of all, the philosophy of this film is juvenile. (...) You know, it is possible to ""get"" something and still not like it.On a serious note; do not watch this if you are epileptic. Since the frames are rotoscoped entirely by hand, they do not line up precisely from one frame to the next. This results in a strobing effect that left me with a splitting headache within 2 minutes, and left me nauseous within 5."
3,Waking Life freaked me out!,"Oh, boy, what a movie! It gave me such a different view on life. I don't thing I'll ever see the world the same way again! Waking Life was actually kind of scary. It had this eerie feeling to it and I'm still haunted by it in short freaky flashes. Some scenes really baffled me while others I really thought about. After seeing that movie, I dream alot more and now I know how to tell if I'm dreaming because of the movie. It really works. This is NOT a good movie to watch just before you go to sleep. It's better for when you wake up in the morning. Big dreamers can watch this movie any time they want. I wouldn't advise showing this movie to little kids because they may be frightened by it. Overall, a fantastic movie but still scary to watch."
1,Painfully boring piece of pseudointellectuallism.,"I had a number of problems with this movie. For a movie that tries so incredibly hard to be profound, the concepts in it are not terribly original, nor particularly conciousness expanding. This movie is basically a series of lectures on philosophy, that someone put in different setting and animated. The concepts given kept me interested for all of around 10 minutes, by which time the endless repitition of the same basic concepts became tiresome.This movie is perfect for people who are in need of something they can watch so that they feel smarter about themselves. However, for someone with serious interest in these topics I would recomend avoiding this movie."
4,love it I really do,"Okay it was intellecually stimulating, but those who exault this movie into a some "" super movie"" if you will,are really pushing it. The first time you see it you will see that it throws alot at you and the things that stick are so very intresting, to ponder. What is life how do you know its not a drem. and so forth. but I reccommend that you watch it several times and I garentee each time something new will stick... but I have to say if you got a group of friends together and disscused after each scene, you will get the most out of the movie it really awakens the mind.One quick word of advice you cannot day dream while you watch the movie you REALLY have to WATCH the movie or you will find your self watching it for four hours because you had to rewind so much to understand what was going on... The only thing that I didnt like was the movement of backrounds with the animation at some points it really gets distracting but you'll live. Buy it its a great movie"
3,Not for everyone.,"The animation is great but this movie put me to sleep 15 minutes into it. Basically the movie revolves around a guy who walks around running into people who then begin to lecture him about life, reality, and dreams. Not a terrible movie but a lot patience (and caffiene) may be needed."
1,so disappointed,"I heard such fantastic things, but I couldn't even finish it. I felt like I was sitting and listening to one of those guys you knew in college who talked and talked about postmodernism and existentialism, but never actually SAID anything.Further, reviewers keep writing ""Not for everyone"" or ""Not everyone will understand."" I get it, just like I can ""understand"" the movie Gigli, but that doesn't mean it's smart or sophisticated, or worth watching or that it even has a point!Do not waste two precious hours of your life on this!"
1,Endless Torture,"One can imagine this film playing well on college campuses, where philoso-babbling is good sport. One can imagine it playing well in art houses, where self-flagellation passes for virtue. For the rest of us, there is only the Chinese water torture of wretched excess and navel-gazing. The good news is, were you to turn off the sound, you could be hypnotized by the absolutely spellbinding animation, thoroughly original and brilliantly executed. The bad news is, if you turn the sound on, you may find yourself asking questions like, ""Am I writing a review, or am I dreaming about writing a review? Am I a dream a man is having about writing a review? Am I a review of a man dreaming? Am I a man dreaming about writing a review so that he can discover what he thinks? Am I a man thinking about writing a review about a dream a man was thinking about having when he was writing a review about thinking?"" Drip, drip, drip."
4,"A challenging, thought-provoking movie!","This movie is vitamins for the mind. there is so much discussion on the animation, but to be honest for me the animation was secondary, the content and the Linklaters writing and direction of all the philosophical conversations I found to be riveting.Mind you, not everyone likes this stuff...many of my friends think its too heavy, pretentious, or what not but everyone for themselves - this is one of my favourite movies and DVD is just great.Unique and stylish for people who want to think about their movies afterwards!Recommended!"
5,The most mentally stimulating movie I have ever seen.,The movie was absolutley fantastic. It proves that film making is still an art form. A none stop tour de force of philosophical ideas and overall great dialog. The visuals are also stunning.
5,a must for animation fans!,"This movie is a must for animation fans, and anyone who has ever wondered about the meaning of existance!But while this film could have been strictly eye candy it is wonderful in the topic it follows!This is mainly centered between dreams and reality,and the animation technique on this makes it feel like a dream!I highly recomend this to anyone!You may even learn something without getting bored a quarter of the way through!"
4,visually fascinating,"When the special effect is everything, anything other willbe omitted. This film, meanwhile, is worth seeing only forits visual beauty."
1,Disappointed,The DVD is NTSC format and I can not view it. I did not see any warnings about it. Also with the Australian postal address it should automatically create a warning about the wrong system format. Disappointed
4,I think I have seen this one before...,"and it was a movie called "" slacker "" where a camera just goes around from person to person and they expound on their philosophy of life or just rant about whatever's in their heart and mind. i have seen two of linklater's movies, "" slacker"" and "" dazed and confused "" and i think he is a brilliant filmmaker.this however is just a revision of "" slacker "" with some new wrinkles thrown in. i would have rated this film lower, but the animation is revolutionary. he shot the movie on film, then had animation done to the film. when i watched it, it was like a peter max cartoon coming to life, plus it was entertaining enough to make me forgive linklater's slight of hand..."
2,Was a good effort,"This movie takes the risk and gets silly at times. It is a series of monologues (Or an alternative description would be 'ramblings'). There is not, however, anything deep or eye-opening about it. Rather just observations from an 'altered' state of mind. As a whole, it comes off as pretentious. The rotoscoping technique used is different but not terribly inventive or original. I wasn't impressed but it was a good effort."
2,"I want to like it, but can't","I'll admit that there are many amazing qualities of this movie; the animation over live action technique produces brilliant effects that are visually interesting the entire way through. The wealth of ideas presented about dreams, life and the world around us are incredibly vast and thought provoking. The acting (predominantly the voices) is incredibly well done, as is the music. But unfortunately, there is no plot. Not only that, but the ideas keep coming at you. While some of the ideas were interesting, others were not. And the ones that were interesting became lost in the shuffle. I went to see the movie with three friends; whithin half an hour they were all asleep. This movie is a few good ideas and scenes stretched out far too long. That it keeps throwing out more and more ideas at the audience doesn't serve to make it good...and i'm usually very open minded."
3,A real dichotomy of a movie,"Why? Because watching this I found myself both utterly fascinated and completely bored at the same time. I'm fascinated by the dreaming state of mind. For better and for worse, Waking Life gets at the idea of what dreams are like with an original take on the idea. It doesn't all work, but it's better than a lot of other slicker films out there. At the very least this is a film about ideas rather than blowing stuff up; it tries (if not always succeeds) to engage the viewer's mind rather than play as mere eye candy."
2,Beautiful but boring!!!,"Richard Linklater has made some good movies and I appreciate what he's trying to do here, but the film was downright excruciating to watch. I can't imagine anyone finding it interesting, but apparently, many do. Maybe Philosophy itself just bores me. I did think the animation was cool, and the Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Before Sunrise scene was inspired, otherwise, this film is better left on the shelf. It is definitely not for all tastes."
1,A slap in the face to GOOD Independent Films - AVOID,"This movie was an embarrassing attempt to be ""artsy"" and I use the quotes around the word onpurpose. WAKING LIFE was nothing more then a movie were someone had a great idea for ainteresting concept and that was all. The film would have worked as a 15 minute short film (tops).It was almost comically pretentious and the script writer seemed to being trying to be ultra-philosophical on a subject that is not deep enough to talk about as long as they did. The questionthe film asks is one asked over and over- one that simply makes you go ""hmm?"" and nothingmore. It was almost like watching people pretend to be intellectual who were not. This film wasinsulting to intelligent audience members and was one of the very worse movies I have ever seen.The creators cannot fool everyone that they had anything original or interesting to say."
3,I don't like all the philosophy yet overall one can learn something,"First of all this film as an art film has captured my attention but what initially prompted me to buy it was the subject of lucid dreaming. This is movie is the best in portraying lucid dreaming's elements. About the discussions and philosophy of it, i don't buy it full through, i like some philosophies such as the 'ant' one, the 'boatcar' one,the 'dream chapel' one, and perphaps the 'holy moment', but overall though i like the tone of the film, but now being a christian who has found the truth-namely CHRIST-this film doesn't leave me anywhere really (with its philosophy) beyond where i am, but of course this is not a christian-tone film. But still one can retain the good and leave out the rest(paraphrasying) as St.Paul would say."
3,Greatest Hits Video Collection 1 and 1/2,"I think it is great that another Video Collection has been released. I just would have thought that the newest release, would have picked up where the first Collection ended. And I would have thought the first Collection would have been released on DVD by now also. I guess we have to wait until after the first of the year for the rest of the videos?"
1,it sucks,"This Alan Jackson cd sucked. It came on time, but will not play on my cd player. It also doesn't play on my dvd either. I was so diapointed because I love alan Jackson! I won't order on line again."
2,Not enough for a book,"It happens that Ray Bradbury spent a few months in Ireland while he was writing the script for a Moby Dick movie and he decided to write a book about his experience in the land of St. Patrick. The problem is that nothing worth of a whole book happened there. Just an eternal rain, some anecdotes with locals and many critics to the Irish."
4,A Fascinating Read for fans of Bradbury & John Huston,"This novel ficitionalizes Bradbury's experiences in writing the screenplay for John Huston's film of ""Moby Dick."" The book provides some of the background and re-tells several of Bradbury's Irish stories. The novel's high point is Bradbury's re-telling of his short story The Banshee. Put in its context of being written as an assault on Huston, the tale becomes even more chilling. This book may not be for everyone, but for people interested in Bradbury or Huston, it's a must-read."
1,Insane,"You would have to be nuts to beleive this. Mishapen, out of proportion, umm, lets see, WRONG COLOR! Absolutely Insane!"
1,This sword sucks,"I dont own this and never will. This thing isn nothing like Tidus' Brotherhood. The Brothehood was blue, its had a point at the end of the blade, and the curve at the point looks nothing like that. The Brotherhood was an awsome sword and this thing is crap. I would recommend spending $40.00 on this."
3,More form than function-sadly,"Bought this at a local shop on sale but had been eying it for awhile due to the cool modern styling. I reminisced about the performance of my Dad's old beat up thermos. Still steaming hot after all day at an outside chilly job. This model is pretty but not up to snuff. If you are taking it to work and go from heated place to heated place you may be fine, but it can't take very much cold before giving up on your beverage. A long ride to the beach in March and it didn't even get me a few hours into the trip- bummer."
3,Bodum Thermos,Ok for what it is. FYI: not insulated. single thin wall. Not practicle for extended time use. Fill and drink with-in a couple hours. Does not keep beverage hot or cold for very long.
2,Others have done far better,"I've been studying iconography for about seven years and I've read a lot of the literature out there in both English and Russian on this subject. The problem with this book is that its treatment of iconographic history is bad and its theology isn't really much better. Its main redeeming quality is its illustrations, which are really not all that numerous. I would skip this in favor of two others; the first is The History of Icon Painting, written by a panel of distinguished iconography historians, each an expert in one particular period and school of iconography, and edited by Archimandrite Zaccheus; the second is The Meaning of Icons by Leonid Ousspensky (who was himself an outstanding iconographer) and Vladimir Lossky (who was a respected Russian academic theologian). Both are available here on Amazon. Another good source is also by Ousspensky, his Theology of the Icon (2 volumes)."
4,Salad Days,"A charming musical from the 1950's. The performance style and audio quality are somewhat dated, but they give this an authentic charm. This show exudes an innocence and simplicity with its catchy tunes and fantasy plot."
2,Glaring Omission of Certain Topic,"I have enjoyed Mr. Birch's work and it does have a lot of great information. The biggest problem and it is big is that he only hints at the apostasy within the hierarchy of the Church. Nothing for example is mentioned about one of the biggest apparitions of our Lady at LaSalette in France. This apparition is ignored by many and has been because it deals with the very difficult subject of apostasy of the Church and Rome becoming the seat of the AC. This is hard stuff to hear back when the apparition occurred and now but at the dawn of Petrus Romanus, readers deserve to know this information. Just my .02"
5,amanda bratz,"I love all bratz toys, my best friend and play w/ them all the time- my mom is ordering Eitan for me, because we can not friend it anywhere"
5,Whirling Sprinkler,"very nice sprinkler. Stands tall, perfect for my vegetable garden. Provides a very delicate shower."
3,Not for the humanities,"While I agree with other reviewers that the book is concise and well-written, I did not find it useful for the liberal arts. The methods and topics described are better suited for social sciences or subjects that involve data analysis and experiments."
3,:(,"At least this book hasn't got all the characters in sexual positions, but it does have very boring looking characters also... Maybe the specific male / female books aren't his best works."
3,its the only one like it so...,"I really don't like it but its really the ONLY male reference book in the entire series unless Yaoi counts....You'd be better off buying Yaoi manga if you want to see what guys look liek but if you cant stomach two guys together then go ahead and get the book. It gives a basic guide but doesn't go nearly as into detail as the female equivalent of this bookTechniques for Drawing Female Manga Characters. and look at the number, they waited to volume 27 to make a Male book. It goes into to hairstyles for some reason , taking up 3 pages of hairlines.Despite the cover it will not really help you draw 10 year old boys. It will only help you draw 20-28 yr old guys and shows a lot of costumes for guys."
3,it's for beginers,The book has relatively good pictures and instruction as far as drawing instruction books go; however it is nothing new. It's nothing that you couldn't get in a basic How To Draw Manga book. Actually it's a little less than what you could get in your typical How To Draw Manga book as there isn't the female instruction as well. If you're a beginner and you only expect to be drawing males then this is for you; however if you want something a bit more than basics this is not for you. So again I'll say it's for beginners.
3,Its okay,"I have used many of the ""how to"" series books, I was always looking for this one since I had others. The only thing I didn't like about it was there isn't much advice on how to draw the male figure. Like when draw the female figure, there are a lot points on how to keep the figure slender, eyes shape feminine, and hands as well! But for the males, its like, ""oh, just remember men are more boxed-shaped and women are more round..."" -___- Geez! Thanks for letting me know something I already knew! I was hoping the book was going to have some advice on how to keep a male look like a male besides from broad shoulders and muscle definition... But that's just me."
5,Useful for more than just manga art,"This is a great reference book in my opinion, especially if you have no idea how to even pronounce anatomy. If you're looking to be able to draw seriously thoroughly detailed super-muscle men, this might not be the best book, but It definately is great for beginners, and it gives a lot of great examples of how what part of the body looks liek what when a male character does what. For instance theres a whole page on hands, and hand positions, and one for glasses... one shows how the chest moves as the arm moves. Great reference if you don't have a model or a bunch of nude pictures in front of you. I love this guide. Borrowed it to my friend who want's to improve her skills as well, and she's becoming amazing at drawing men!"
3,Not been much of a help yet.,"I recently purchased htis book, and as an amatuer, I really don't like it. However, I am glad that I got it. You don't see books focusing on drawing Male characters very often. But I wish I could have seen more full pictures, this including clothing and faces. Most of the book focuses on the different types of male bodies, and they seem to teach the same things repeatedly throughout the book. Although very few of the pictures have clothing, There really wouldn't be much ""nudity"" considering that all of them either wear breifs or simply nothing down there,like a barbie doll. Of course, there are many,many buttocks shots that I found rather disturbing, but that is only me. Although I have not learned all that muh form this book, I have a feeling it will come in great handy very soon. So I give it 3 stars and recommend having it around."
2,"Finally, I can draw men!","I've Always had trouble drawing male characters. In fact, Before I got this book, the faces and heads were good, but the bodies looked like cilenders with arms attatched. This book covers every aspect of drawing the male form from the basics of figure drawing, to little details like adding age to a characters features. There is so much to learn about art, but this book simplifies things to the extent where an artist with enough familiarity with the style can refine her or his art many times over."
2,its not great,I do not own this book... I barrowed it from a freind of mine. It had almost the same thing on every page! i learned 1 skill... how to draw the torso.
5,Amazed!,"I've been using this product ever since it came out on HSN. I repurchased here because it was slightly cheaper. This product is costly no matter where you buy it, I searched all over the web and the price only varies by a few dollars.Read other people's reviews which would be similar to what I would write, I recommend this product."
5,best ever deodorizer,Have used this product for several years and nothing compares to it for deodorizingIt is great for invalid care .
5,xo,"XO is a great product for removing odors...also can act as a cleaning agent as well...I'm asthmatic and can tolerate it well...it has a nice subtle smell...but not a fragrance that will get you sick if you are sensitive. Also, great at getting rid of woodsmoke."
4,"Good quality, but not fit Honda 1-DIN MP3 player","i purchased it to install my Honda MP3 1-DIN player which was bought 2nd hand.This item is of very good quality, i do think it fits aftermarket 1-DIN stereos.But for my Honda MP3 (08A06-4E1-200), it couldn't fit. What a pity.i then sold it on an auction site, and was taken immediately. The buyer likes it very much. So if you're going to install a 1-DIN aftermarket stereo for your Accord, this is a good pick."
5,Best installation kit,"This is the best on the market.1. It includes Wire harness that also gives power to your radio system. You can still light your stereo and climate control in the night. However, you need a code for the radio after you re-connect the power in your radio. If you use other wire harness, you will have a difficulty to find a climate control button in the night.2. In my case, i didn't need extention cord. You just unplug the factory radio cable and plug it to the aftermarket stereo. No extention radio cable needed."
2,Poor quality,"The mounting panel works fine, but I received a defective connector. I ended up having to solder several of the wires directly, because the connector supplied with this kit wasn't properly crimped and several wires weren't making contact with the car's factory wiring. I almost went nuts trying to figure that one out."
1,Parent Beware! Not PG closer to R,"Not a good movie to watch with 9 and 12 year old. The language, and inappropriate scenes were definitely a disappointment. Although the were many good parts, it was not worth the exposure."
4,Tank,"A James Garner feel good movie. He was under utilized by Hollywood as a dramatic actor, but as a comic actor he wasn't that bad. The camera had a love affair with his open good looks, a pleasant sense of humor and the ability to laugh at himself. No deep introspective thinking needed with this film. The plot is simple enough, he is retired military and he and his son have restored a Sherman tank. The local sheriff a slightly sadistic 'Boss Hawg' has issues and throws the son in a prision camp. And its Dad to the rescue. A good afternoon romp with a silly plot. You could do worse."
4,A good diversion --- Worth watching!,"The movie, ""Tank"", was very good. It was funny and touching and well worth watching. You root for the good guys, and want to tell the bad guys to go sit on a cactus. I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even as a family movie. But as an adult, I enjoyed it very much."
5,Tank,An entertaining movie. You need to know a little about the U.S. Army to really understand this movie. Well worth the time to watch this movie.
2,"If you don't remember it, you won't want to see it.","I remember watching this film on HBO when HBO had just come out (Remember when Fraggle Rock was on HBO, and it was a family channel during the day?). I just bought it and watched it for the first time since then. It's a typical 80s movie with cheesy lines and some very unrealistic scenes. I'd have to call it a cross between Red Dawn and Over The Top. Some funny parts, stuff gets blown up, run over, and a family grows closer together. The language isn't appropriate for young kids. (This was before PG-13 was introduced)"
2,Probably Garner's worst film.,"I love James Garner movies and TV shows, except this one. Sorry James, but experimenting with foul language and adult situations in a less than respectful manner does not fit your character. I still respect and enjoy your other endeavors, but Tank is trash! I tried to fix the stars down to zero, but it wouldn't let me. Sorry but it gets a zero from me."
1,"""TANK"" DVD","The ordering and order-filling/shipping processes were handled in a manner consistent with Amazon's typical style - very professionally and with dispatch. The particular DVD, however, proved to be defective. In accordance with written instructions, I have returned it to Amazon. As soon as I receive my ""Credit"" I plan to order another copy of the same DVD. Hopefully, I'll get a good one on my next try. Again, it was the PRODUCT, not the procedure that I had a problem with."
3,James Garner is So Great,"This is a pretty decent film. I especially loved James Garner. His character is a Master Sergeant in the army and Garner plays him with a full measure of tough charm. If you liked Garner in ""The Rockford Files"" then you will probably like him in this as well.The plot has to do with Garner using an old Sherman tank to bust his teeneage son (C. Thomas Howell) out of a prison farm in Georgia. The kid was put in there by a corrupt local sheriff. After exhausting all the usual methods of helping his son, the Sergeant is driven to desperation. He wants to use the tank to transport his son all the way to Tennessee, where he hopes to get a fair hearing from the officials there. Of course, the trip is fraught with complications.The plot is not meant to be taken too seriously. It is a largely light-hearted film. I enjoyed watching it and it was a true pleasure to see James Garner do such a great job."
5,Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,This is a great book to read with Pre-K/kindergarteners on the first day of school to help calm anxieties over being in a new setting and not knowing anyone.
5,Another wonder Warren Wiersbe book,"Wiersbe's ""Be"" series books are all worth purchasing. His explanations of Bible passages are clear and his applications to daily life give one ""food for thought"" and challenges for living life as a Christian. He writes about our failures and our mistakes, but what I have frequently said, he does it in a kindly manner. I have enjoed every book by him that I have read. Thanks to him for the time and study it took to write the ""Be"" series."
1,ripped easily,I used one of these sheets to cover my couch when i was gone and my dog jumped up on the couch and his claws ripped this sheet into shreds. No other sheets have ever done this before.
3,sheets,These are warm sheets- but the first time I washed them- there was a hole in the flat sheet. Otherwise for the price I like them.
3,"Good value, average quality","In summary: Good value. Average quality.These sheets are not the greatest. They are pretty lightweight (compared to the flannel sheets I bought from Costco), and a little rough. However, for the price I paid ($[...]) I am happy enough with them. I've washed them once and expect they will get a little softer with repeated washings. I was a little disappointed with the number of flaws in the fabric - not just loose threads but the number of pulled threads and defects."
5,Great value!,"These sheets look good, feel good, and they fit perfectly! After I got this set I ordered more in different patterns. Great value!"
3,thin flannel sheet,"I was not satisfied with this sheet set, it is thin and it's not so smooth...I gave it as a gift, and when I saw and tried to touch the material, I got disappointed I think it's not worth giving it ."
4,Great price,"I am happy with this sheet set as it was very, very low in price and is not like cardboard to sleep on. I knew it was risky buying such ""cheap"" sheets, but they're not bad! Enough so that I went back and bought more."
4,Probably not for the masses...,"If this were a general album review, I would be hard-pressed to give it more than 3 stars. But it is a 5-star album for Mondays fans, simply because something is better than nothing (right?). This sounds at times like a recorded drug trip, which it probably was for the most part. The vocals are burried and Shaun sounds horrible at times. Lyric it is not, more spoken word riffing and story telling. The music is akin to a slightly sinister lounge/chill with a good deal of dub tossed in. Not in any way ground-breaking, the music is nonetheless well crafted. Unfortunately, there are not enough guitars to really compare this with HM or BG, but it does have the unmistakeable howel of Shaun. From prescient and witty to utterly juvenile, you gotta love 'em. Keep it coming Shaun, we need your voice!"
2,An Interesting Progression,"To be short, a cool vocal album with Shaun behind dancy music. A must buy for true fans of the Happy Mondays and Black Grape. Scooter Girl is an excellent track. It stayed in my mixed cd player for quite some time. Anyway, much better than that with Bez, though we love 'im."
3,Vault.com has more up -to-date contact info,"Try Vault.com for more up-to-date, 2003 info than is contained the this 1998 book."
4,very good; also get the Vault guide,"This book is an excellent directory of Wall Street search firms. Also get the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking and the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which has actual Wall Street finance interview questions and answers."
3,Interesting,"Mia Fields has done a fine job telling her story. However, I would suggest in the future she get her facts regarding Government Agencies in order before publishing any other stories of this nature. Her information pertaining to the Federal Agency in question is totally incorrect and misleading. As a former employee of the Agency in question, I am dismayed by her portrayal of this Agency's employee as being totally out of control, cold hearted, and calculating. This type of portrayal only serves to full the fires against these employees and brings forth further misinformation regarding what this Agency works for. I suggest next time she contact the Agency she is portraying in her books to assure that her information is correct."
3,Repair issues,"I purchased the 55"" version of this Philips projection television 3 years ago. It was delivered in great shape and I have, to this point, been very happy with this TV.Problems began with a power outage that took my TV out of service. This television is huge and awkward to move. Some elements and/or modules need to be replaced at a service center (must be taken out of the home). A costly, frustrating dilema to say the least. I still do not have it repaired. NOTE: parts a difficult to locate so I feel that I'm being price-gouged if I give a go-ahead to be repaired.My recommendation to you if you plan on purchasing a 55"" widescreen TV is to purchase a TV with a separate STAND to set it on. Do not buy the one piece large honker like I did.Other than the repair frustrations and costs -- I loved this television. Now, however, after only 3 years I'm pretty much forced to buy another television because it would cost $600-$800 (atleast) to get this television repaired."
2,Save your money,"I bought this book thinking that it might (possibly) be different than others I have bought in the past...I was wrong. Most of it is just common sense of being a loving parent. I'd give you an example, but I've already taken the book back to the store to get my money back. Ms. Bisset asked for advice from every day people and, I imagine, just any parent in general for their insight, which I thought was great, but she seemed to gear the entire book of quotes or ideas from her family or celebrities, which I was highly disappointed in as it seemed maybe that's the only way she could get her book published. I was disappointed. I imagine it would make a great gift for someone somewhere, but I won't be the one giving it. I hear she's coming out with another book. I hope this one isn't the same as the first one. I'll check it out, but won't be surprised if I have to take that one back as well :)"
5,nice cable,"It works as stated, quality looks ok, Too bad you can not get this equipment from US instead of Asia."
4,Excelente opción para recordar los primeros meses del bebe,"Es un libro muy completo que abarca desde el embarazo incluyendo espacio para ecografías y fotos prenatales, hasta las primeras fiestas importantes del bebe como navidad y cumpleaños. Lo recomiendo para aquellos padres que deseen llevar un registro de los primeros logros de su bebe y recordar esos gratos momentos de la infancia. Mi única observación es que la portada no es totalmente dura y llegó un poco abollada."
4,Baby diary,Muy completo y especificio. Ideal para registrar los datos de tu bebe asi como del embarazo.
3,It is a document,"The present edition of the book is a little below the international standards. Which frequently happens to the books edited in India. The work can be said a ""classic"" or at least the main document for the study of ""hindutva"" (the hindu nationalist ideology). Savarkar gives a name to such an ideology and a sort of ""manifesto"". As regards the contents, everything depends on your point of view."
3,If your resolution is to start lifting weights,"I have this watch and it's certainly a well-made Seiko product, but by the end of the day I can't wait to remove it (and sometimes earlier). It is extremely heavy. Since I only paid $59 for it, I don't mind so much, but at $99, I definitely wouldn't buy it."
4,"Not All It Could've Been, But Still Good","I am happy that the powers at be decided to continue releasing The Cosby Show. However, it is my opinion that this set was not given as much attention or care as the first two seasons. For instance, there are no extras, no ""Play All"" feature, not even episode descriptions inside the package! At least the episodes continue to be uncut.As for the shows themselves, they are great, with clean humor and light family fun. I liked the episode ""Theo's Flight,"" and the others are good as well. Overall I am happy to own this set, because in the end the episodes are what counts.I do recommend buying this set. It could've been better, but the episodes are very funny. Also one must take into account that if we (the fans) don't contine to support the series the studios won't release it at all next time."
4,Fun to Watch!,Fun to watch it over again. The whole family came together and watched it back to back and laughed and laughed.
5,Tiene subtitulos en español,"Tras ver la primera y segunda temporada, hoy comencé con la tercera temporada. Quería informaros que esta tercera temporada incorpora subtitulos en español (it has spanish subs). La 1 y la 2,no. Esta serie es FANTASTICA! os la recomiendo a tod@s!!"
2,A Word of Warning.,"This season they have changed a couple of things. First, no funny bloopers on the last disc like seasons past. Second, you can no longer select a ""PLAY ALL"" option. That is a very bad decision if you ask me. Every TV show DVD should have that. I like to sleep with the TV set on a timer at night. And I'll play an entire TV show disc. You can't do that when they remove the entire option like they did with this season. Lastly, they changed the type of case. It is no longer a fold out gate box. It's 3 mini thin DVD cases in a slip case. Not that that's bad, but I hate it when they do that when earlier seasons were different. Your collection will not be uniform. So despite this being a great show. The lack of effort all of a sudden is easliy noticable. They wen't ""cheap"" on us. Cosby Show deserves better than this."
3,mbt123,"I LOVE the Cosby show but these DVDs aren't the best. There is no ""play all"" feature so once one show is over you have to go back to the main menu to play the next episode."
2,Not so great.....,"I thought with this being a 5mp camera it would have great resolution....not true I have found. My pictures come out fuzzy, the coloring looks weird no matter what setting I have it on and I can't take pictures close up without catching a lot of glare. Also I can't take pictures in any kind of low lighted place. I think I actually got better pictures with my Kodak 2.1 MP camera."
2,So disappointed,"This camera was not worth the money spent. The pictures, no matter the setting come out blurry, too dark, too light or odd looking. Go for a different camera. THis is not a camera for any one who would like to take pictures that are meant to keep memories alive."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Put your money towards a better camera by Nikon or Olympus. Every picture I take that is not naturally lit comes out fuzzy no matter what I do. There are horrible glare problems, the flash lag is very frustrating as well as the lag between pictures. When the flash is reloading you can't do anything else on the camera - it is like it's frozen - not even turn the camera off or use the menu. The camera has a cheap plastic feel, the LCD screen is pretty small. Overall, this is a camera I would give to my 7 year old daughter. If you want good pictures go somewhere else. I would recommend the Nikon Coolpix series or the Sony DSPs."
5,excellent notes on a dated but fascinating novel,"With the DVD remastering of the 1925 film of ""The Lost World"", this book makes a fascinating companion. I read the novel in my teens and it was fun to re-enter Doyle's world and remeet the fascinating Prof.Get the book and the remastered DVD - making sure you get the restored version."
5,The book I wanted it had 1 million pages or more,"The book I wanted it had 1 million pages or more. The best bookwriten by Arthur Conan Doyle. Unbeateble. Wonderful. Exciting.Unforgetteable. Describe a lost world, in brazilian amazon, in which wecan travel with ancient animals e susprising adventures. Sometimes it's atrue thiller. The author deserves a Nobel, by the so precise description.We sure think we are inside the book, living all that moments andsurprises. NO WORD CAN DESCRIBE THE TALENT OF CONAN DOYLE IN THAT BOOK,EVEN SO SHERLOCK HOLMES."
2,No Way!,"My daughter liked this doll until she tried to dress it, she couldn't even get the clothes on it cause they fit so tight. Second of all, they look hideous, especially without their shoes on. I went and got her My Scene Barbie, they are even prettier and easy to dress, the shoes go on and off better, and look better too. She really likes the My Scene Barbie and Friends. Get My Scene instead of the Bratz dolls."
4,Good source,"This book is a good reference for anyone looking for good fiction books for grades 3-8. It is easy to use, it categorizes the books by subject, and it gives a lot of information about the books listed. The only thing it is missing is the price of the books, but that differs depending on where you buy your books anyway. All the books have been reviewed by notable children's literature reviewing periodicals. This book is a great resource for parents, teachers, or librarians."
3,A Tad Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Chuck Leavell's, but I found this album a bit lacking. I much prefer Sea Level and the lovely Forever Blue. Not saying it's not a great CD, just not my favorite. It seems to me to be a little cliched and tries just a little too hard. Perhaps Mr. Leavell intended to create a 'Southern Suite' and that's how it should be listened to.Again just my opinion, but I thought Southscape was not nearly as melodic and well, charming as some of Mr. Leavell's other work. Still good patio music, and still better than lots of other music around, but Sea Level and Forever Blue get a lot more play than this one."
5,This is Jazz,"Chuck Leavell is behind some rollicking blues-rock, and that's why I bought this album. Then it turned out this album is full of Jazz. Not to put down Jazz, but perhaps you like to know what style of music you are buying.I'm not qualified to judge the quality of the music, but the system requires me to choose a star rating so I'm calling it a Five Star to be safe. I really have no idea."
1,*Very* Boring,This CD is so boring. I'm terribly dissapointed I bought it. I was expecting some jamming music and instead got slow dreamy instrumentalism that I don't like at all. If that picture of Chuck Leavell doing some wierd kum-bah-ya meditation stuff had been on the front cover instead of inside the package I would have been tipped off before spending any money. I can't imagine what this has to do with the South that I grew up in.
5,A Good Simple Guide from a Great Photographer,"This book was published in 1978 and is a pleasure. Eisenstaedt used Leica rangefinders and Nikon SLRs. The book contains many pictures and Eisenstaedt explains how he made each one. His favorite combination was the Leica M and a 35 mm lens. He used a tripod as needed. Eisenstaedt cautions to ""keep itsimple."" ""The most important thing about a camera is that you feel comfortable with it,"" he says. Good down to earth advise throughout the book. Photography is not about equipment and technique; those are givens. It is about vision."
5,Wonderful Guide,"Outstanding guide from one of the greatest photographers of the last century. Each picture is followed by his description of how he took it, and what camera and lens he used. Although his first choice is a Leica with a 35-mm lens, a picture of his equipments shows Leica 28-mm, 35-mm, 50-mm, 90-mm as well as Nikon 28-mm, 55-mm f/3.5 Micro Nikkor, 105-mm f/2.5, 80-200 zoom lenses as well as a yellow filter, a polarizing filter and Luna Pro and Spectra light meters. He also took color pictures. What is most impressive is the spontaneity and the decisive moments of his shots!"
5,A worthwhile read!,"This is a charming and informative book, packed with information told in a very personal manner. I'd highly recommend it to those in other countries planning to visit or move to the United States, and also to Americans interested in learning about the process of adaptation faced by newcomers. Thank you Ms. Erten!"
4,Everyone should read this book who travels.....,"Everyone should read this book who travels, expecially abroad, as well as those that may consider moving to the United States permanently from a foregin country. Ms. Erten has put a perspective on this book like no other I have seen... and I lived in Europe for many years as child growing up in a military family. I wish we had a book like this that could have helped us back then! Ms. Erten's style and poise comes through clearly in her words----and it makes a remarkable story and an interesting read, one that surely will be read over and over in my household! Five stars to Ms. Erten and I hope she writes another story someday soon!"
4,straight to the Point,one thing about Chaka Khan is that She doesn't pull any punches about any subject matter&comes at you very direct.that is why I was looking forward to this book.it covers alot of bases&is Good.
5,Rave Review,I couldn't be happier with the great service I received. The book arrived in just a few days (from California to me in Ohio) and in excellent condition. I would deal with this seller again in a heartbeat.
1,THOUGH THE FIRE,BIG CHAKA KHAN FAN but this book just did'nt do it chaka didnt show up until around the 13 chapter
5,Great book!,Too bad not enough people know about Chaka Khan in 2005.One great female vocalist.This is a great book.
2,Wait for the movie,"I guess if you are really in love with Chaka Khan, the book will be alright for you. I liked her music years ago, and realized I didn't know a lot about her, so I got the book. I was surprised that it was so boring. Get it from the library. It really wasn't worth buying and had no insight into the real chaka. Where were the facts that exist in other biographys?"
3,Less than what I expected,"With all the glowing praise heaped upon Khan's autobiography, I anticipated a work cut above the usual. Unfortunately, it is the usual lifestyle that entertainers tout as part of their past that makes this book ""routine"": dysfunction in the family, drug abuse, touring and band tensions, failed relationships, and ""rehabilitation"" from all the wrongs.While a well-written and organized piece, the book just fails to really ""catch fire"". The two sets of personal photos are welcome and do add to the enjoyment of the read. Also, a lengthy discography fills out the final section of the book.I just wish the text had been more scorching."
3,Keep Up the Good Work Chaka,"This opening comment is directed to the writer who titled their review; ""Chaka Uncut"".Aretha gave birth to her first child when she was thirteen years of age. She most certainly could be Chaka's momma. As we used to say in the neighborhood a very looong time ago....""So talk what you know!""A good read. Boring if you are looking for lots of juicy details about intimate and private portions of the author's life.I believe this is an honest and forthright book that makes Chaka transparent before her fans and the world. Chaka's drug addiction and addled behavior was a well know industry secret.It's good to know she is clean and moving forward with her life. She purports to be a Christian these days. Lets all wish her the best.In Uncharacteristic Charity,Miss Ross"
2,Chaka! Through the Fire,"Terribly boring book, almost like a record company exec giving facts ,, nothing interesting in there ..while reading this book, I was always waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did..Please write another book Chaka and tell us what happened during your Musical journey !!!"
3,Soul Survivor. . .,"Recently checked out this book and thought it was not bad as celebrity memoirs go. Though the book is a collaborative effort, it is unmistakeably the voice of Chaka Khan. She frankly discusses both the successes, spoils and the pressures of an unexpectedly rapid rise to pop stardom. As the powerhouse tomboy of seventies soul music, Chaka Khan created a amazing body of work with the integrated pop/rock/soul band Rufus. On her own, she has been less successful but no less interesting. Indeed, she is now getting her well-deserved props for the white-hot trail she blazed in pop/R&B music. At the same time, she is also upfront about her legendary drug problems, romantic failings and her flaws as a parent. All told, this is a quick read, enjoyable and very down-to-earth."
4,SAW is like the orginal JEEP,"I have My Saw for for a little more then Two years and it is Great. I have a had no problems with anything, I would only tell those looking into the saw think of the extras that you might want it is cheaper to buy the saw with them Vs. adding them later such as the fence and the Wings they are just fine the way they are being stamped steal but I wanted to upgrade them to the cast iron but cant seem to find them and as for it being like a Jeep It is a work house it looks for little or no mataince looks might not be all that but it does a great job other things to keep in mind the cast iron weights down the saw which will reduce the vibration and you might want to change the belt with a inter locking V belt it does a great job on reducing vibration as well. Jet is great but Dont go on name brands do your home work befor you buy."
2,Jet Saw Purchase,"I recently purchased the Jet JWTS-10JF Table Saw. I spent a full day assembling the saw. I found that the SAW BLADE was not included in the purchase. You have to buy the blade ""locally"". This was not explained in the description of the ""Table Saw""; perhaps they should name it a ""JWTS-10JF Table"". It is a rowboat without oars, a bicycle without pedals, a car without gas. The old adage, 'batteries not included' should be prominently displayed!"
5,Your work is only as good as your tools.,"I'll leave all of the more technical, and overwritten reviews for ""the professionals"", and say only that it is an absolute pleasure to own and use this machine. I'm slowly replacing all of the junk hand-me-downs I used to use, and to now have a tool that causes an audible ""AHHH HA HA HA!"" after a cut makes the work fun as well as accurate. There are much better machines at much higher prices, and if you can afford them go for it, or if you are a Norm Abram type ""puhfectionist"", look at the ultimate top of the line. For the rest of us small shop, small budget users, you won't be dissapointed with this tool.As far as JET is concerned, well my experience with customer service over a different item has left EVERYthing to be desired. Unfortunately. But it still doesn't taint this saw."
1,The format description is FALSE!!,"This DVD is *NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED* at all! Wasted $$ and Amazon won't give me full refund at all, even it was their mistake."
5,Great book full of resources,"This is a wonderful introduction to Direct Instruction - one of the most effective methods of teaching ever created. I used Direct Instruction in a 6th grade classroom where half of the students couldn't read 3 and 4 letter words. By the end of the year, my students were reading like 5th graders, 120 words a minute.This book gives a teacher or parent the tools to apply Direct Instruction to many different forms of learning. It talks about how to use the idea of Direct Instruction and apply it in many different forms.The only problem for parents, is after you read the book and want to buy some of the programs . . . most of them are only available to credentialed teachers. (...)Overall this is a great book for people who want an overview of Direct Instruction and I would highly recommend it to educators, principals and parents who want to understand the theory behind DI."
4,Works great,"I have ordered this produck in the past, I am a soldier who was deployed to Iraq My wife at the time wanted something that she could use to pleaure herself while I was gone, So we puchased this kit so she could use a clone of me and not just any random toy out there. over all the kit was great it can me messy and you have to get ur penis in the mold really fast b4 it gets hard but thats the same with and cloneing kit you purchase. The final product came out perfect. the material is a little stiffer than we had planed but it was a perfect clone."
1,Not for misting.,"This is a squirt gun, there is no spray. It's not all purpose, though it is stated in the description."
3,Tv Sitcom,I was happy to receive this but one of the cases was completely cracked. I am sure that happened in shipping.The price was VERY reasonable. Its a funny show and its nice to have something to watch when the internet is slow.
1,TOO SMALL,I purchased this mattress at a Babies-R-US. When I got the mattress home and put it in the crib it was about 2 inches to small. I took it back to the store and I got the same brand and tried it in the display crib like the one that I purchased and that one was too small as well. I ended up purchasing the Baby Slumber Mattress. I do not beleive that the Sealy Baby Soft Mattress is safe and this product could end up being a potential problem.
2,does not last,"We bought this mattress for our first son. After two years he moved into a toddler bed and this mattress transferred with him until we saw how worn it was. When he laid on it, he sunk into it. We had another baby shortly after he grew out of the crib, so we gave our older son the new mattress, thinking that the baby would weigh nex to nothing and the mattress would support at least him...wrong. Our 12 lb baby looked so uncomfortable. He litterally sunk into the bed. This mattress only lasted two years before you could fold it in half with one finger. It's good for the price, if you only want two years out of it."

4,"""Alice in Lace"" is a book that girls could relate to.","""Alice In Lace"" is about a young girl named Alice Mckinley who gets assigned a prodject in her health class. Her task is to plan a wedding, honeymoon, buy a house, and buy furniture for the house. Her partner for this assignment in Patrick who she secretly loves. While this prodject is happening her father and older brother and chasing there sole mates. Her best friends are also assigned tasks like, buying a car, getting pregnant, and other real life problems that they might face as adults. As i was reading this book i kept relating this book to another book called ""Are you there god its me Margret?"" They both have to do with growing up and maturity. This book is good to read because it deals with relationships between friends and boyfriends and that is good for young women to turn to if they have ant problems with they way their relationships are going."
5,Funny!,"Seventh-grader Alice McKinley's going to marry her boyfriend Patrick, while her friend Pamela is a single mother and her other friend Elizabeth is about to purchase her first car. Well, not exactly...it's an assignment for a class, which is geared toward teaching junior high students how to prepare for real life situations.Within weeks, Alice is alarmed to learn just how much money it takes to plan a wedding - even a simple one - and start a new life. She is stunned at people's reactions, when Pamela sticks a pillow under a maternity blouse and ventures out into town. And a classmate, unhappy about getting a ""boring"" assignment, decides the only way to get revenge is to accuse their teacher of something...Readers will enjoy hearing about Alice, who is just like an ordinary girl facing ordinary problems, but with such humor and spirit, they naturally want to know everything will turn out okay in the end..."
5,Helpful,I've read tons of these books and they all talk about life. They taught me so much about life. It says the right and wrong ways to handle with girl problems that all girls need to know. Like the firsts of everything. I love these books they make me relize I'm not the only girl in the world dealing with problems. Some parents might think that the books are inaprapriet but it saves them from explaining the situations.
5,Very Reasonable,"I've read tons of reviews of people-adults-who think these books are inappropriate. Well, guess what? Phyllis Reynolds Naylor knows a lot more about what girls that age care about than those complaining adults, because girls in that age range think of sex! It's natural! They're curious! That's what makes Alice so realistic, that she's curious too. How can a book with reasonable sexual content (this book discusses but EXTREMELY DISCOURAGES premarital sex and other things) be inappropriate for girls who think about sex, too? This book is well-written and HILARIOUS! I love the part when Elizabeth has to pick out a car for her assignment. GO ALICE!"
1,Inappropriate,It's kind of inappropriate for kids in elementary school. My daughter got this book from her school library and it talks about upper level things. But it is a good lesson for kids in like high school.
3,Very basic; but sometimes you gotta get the basics right.,"Very simple, basic sales instruction; but we sales people tend to forget the simple things about the selling process. This book is a good reminder of the sales process and doing all the steps well. Essentially, if you can prospect, communicate, negotiate, close...etc. then you should be able to hit your quota on a regular basis."
1,does is get any worse?,"I have had the misfortune of attending some of ""MAX_HOLES"" sessions. Talk about a pompous clown baffoon. This book is a series of macho male ramblings trying to disguse itself as a sales manual. MAX can you spell ""proof read."" Does this person grasp that he is offensive with his inane war stories... that are totally irrelevant...Don't bother with this losser...or his ""book."""
4,6624 work bench,This piece is very attractive. Rated 4 instead of 5 stars because the edge treatment on the table top is not as finished as I would have preffered.
2,Lost and Found,Was given a godd review on Sunday Morning. Fair to poor at best. Should return to his former carpentry job!
2,Depressing Music,"I heard a favorable review of this CD on my favorite CBS Sunday Morning TV show. After listening to the entire CD, I must say I have never listened to it again. The music was dreary and drepressing, every song sounding the same. Wish I didn't buy it."
2,Hmmmmm,"I found out about this artist and this cd while watching the Early Show on CBS one Saturday morning. They played one song off the cd that sounded quite good. Sorry to say, there is only one or maybe two other songs that are worthwhile of my cash."
3,So-so,"This is an album of some good tunes and some fairly forgetable ones. Personally I enjoyed songs like Liberty Bell and Why Won't you Believe but was not so keen on Amsterdam and tell me a lie. Thats not to say I hate or even really dislike them I just found them forgetable. The only song I really have major reservations on is The Way I Was Made. It has a catchy tune but the lyrics are awful. He talks of his family history and while I suppose it should be commended that he loves his family so much he would write such a nice song about them but to me it is over the top sickly sweet and the chorus of ""Wow it feels so good to have your blood in my veins"" is pretty cringe worthy. Its is the type of album many singer songwriters have made in recent years some better some worse. I am surprised to find I am the first to give this album 3 stars as i feel it is a decent but not outstanding album."
1,watch out - religious music,"This is Christian music though it was not advertized as such. First it totally sounds like it and next many of the lyrics are, for example there is one song that says""Why won't you believe?Just try this once for meAll you gotta do is just receiveAnd you will be free""He is pushing his b.s. christianity like all of them do so if youo like that sort of thing, this is for you"
4,Strong debut cd,"I like this record. It took a little time to grow on me. Listening to it while driving to work on a dark rainy morning it seemed to click. The lyrics are good, mostly dealing with a relationship gone bad. His influences might include Neil Young. He has a similar choppy rhythm to his guitar work, but in other ways I hear U2 in there. If U2 made an Unplugged CD, it might sound like Griffin House. The closer, ""New Day"", especially so.Give him a shot, I'm glad I did."
4,You Won't Be Disappointed!,"Bought this album at an Over the Rhine concert for which Griffin House opened. The mere fact that OTR, an incredible band with incredible talent, had Griffin House open for them is a testament to his work. The sound and writing are fresh and honest. This guy writes and sings from the heart. A welcome alternative to the empty, pop fluff out there."
2,No illustrations in the hardback version,"This book was listed under the Kindle version as the hardback. This is a new version from Kessinger Publishing which creates reprints of out of print and often expensive books. Unfortunately this sample does not contain any illustrations. The book otherwise is nicely done with clear type and a sturdy cover. This one goes back, what were they thinking? I think I'll look for an original."
3,a little better,this movie was a little better than food 4 the gods. It had a couple good spots in it. Try to purchase a used copy the price will out weigh the movie.
3,"Oh, you dirty rats!","When rogue rats get medieval on a Manhattan department store, its occupants must scratch and scrape their way to survival. Luckily, there just happens to be a rat expert on hand who knows even more about the personal habits of the wily rodents than the American public knows about Paris Hilton. This flick is not to be confused with another mouseterpiece of the same name, released in 2003 -- that one is about killer rats who terrorize the inmates of an insane asylum."
5,Rat-ical,"Now I wouldn't say this is the best ""creature features"" I've seen, but this sure packs a punch.The story is about a department store manager who comes to realize there are rats in her upscale store after a customer is bitten. This bite subsequently leads to this customer be hospitalized. Now of course these could be no ordinary rats, they must of course be genetically altered creatures in order for this movie to make any sense.The only way to get rid of these rats is to bring in the rat expert, Jack Carver. Now Jack has a bachelor's in ratology from the university of Ratcliffe, and knows all about these ratical rodents. He is the only human that can destroy them.Now despite the fact that only two poeple get killed and the fact that Susan should have met her maker in the end, this is a delightful film suitable for the entire family.Other Rat Recommendations:Secret of the NimhKiller RatsDeadly EyesCharlotte's Web"
1,Did NOT work,"I will keep this short and to the point. I rarely get cold sores but when I do they are big and ugly. I applied this at the first sign of a cold sore and it did absolutely NOTHING! It still grew and developed into a full on sore. Save your money! What did work, was tea tree oil and neosporin. Apply the tea tree first let it dry for about 30 minutes then apply the neosporin on top. Gone in 2-3 days."
5,"This Album is the S*** ""Gone on That Bay"" (2003).","Frayser Boy is one of Hypnotize Minds greatest Solo artist to come out since (Project Pat) but like all gangsta rappers, throwing to much energy on the first debut albums you know that the next CD is not exciting as we think and hope for.I recomment ""Gone on That Bay"" (2003) than ""Me Being Me"" which I give it 3.5 and this CD I give it 4.5"
3,A pleasant piece of work,"Vangelis' The City was released in 1990. Eight compositions are presented; these eight pieces evoke what it is like to be in a city. This material is in a New Age musical direction. The songwriting, musicianship, and sound quality are gratifying. Of the eight tracks, my favorite one is the elegant, serene ""Dawn,"" with its soothing wafts of sound. The CD booklet includes various color photos of Vangelis. The disc is just over 43 minutes. The City is recommendable."
2,disappointing but ok,"I'm only a Vangelis fan because of his groundbreaking music from the movie Bladerunner. I read a review that The City is an excellent purchase to follow that soundtrack. It isn't exactly a match to Bladerunner's quality and intensity. Its short, ok, and has some annoying moments."
4,A Tour Of The City or the Future...,"While there have been many comparisons and similarities to Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack, one essential ingredient to The City is it's dream-like musical realm. The first track Dawn can be an alternate take of the opening city sequence of the film BladeRunner. However, on careful listening it takes on a soothing dreamscape ambiance. The track Morning Papers is a repetitive yet smooth background jazz laden number that echoes both a casual stroll throughout the city and yet propels the listener into a futuristic night club or jazz lounge. This work by Vangelis is both moody and tame with underlying tones of melancholy machinations. With a song like Twilight you can almost feel the chill in the air and the different odors or scents associated with a city that is winding down for the night. The best track is Good To See You with its hypnotic sound and female dialogue...This is one mellow Vangelis title of the touring mind not to be missed !"
4,"Good To See You, one of his best works.","Good To See You is my favorite by Vangelis. For me it paints a virtual image in my mind's eye of a slumbering big city at 4 a.m.with it's quiet streets and lonely traffic lights changing without anyone's notice, or a stray cat scampering down an alley way. Quite enchanting. It really is Vangelis at his best; his ability to capture moments in time. Very reminicent of Blade Runner in this way."
4,The City,The City being Vangelis 1990 release and is considered a concept album. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree. The booklet contains many photographs of Vangelis from the time of the release. Recommended. 4/5.
4,Nice,"The City is the kind of CD that you really want to listen through all the way. The tracks do not stand well on their own. It is not his best work, but I really enjoy listening to it when I want to relax. And... there's a Roman Polanski appearance."
4,Bratz are TIGHT!,"Two years ago I got the very first edition of Yasmin and thought she was stupid the next day. I only had 1 so they couldn't talk, or go to the mall or anything. I got a Amazon gift certificate for my birthday and spent it on Style It! 2003 Yasmin AND Cloe. I gave a medium rating in fun, because Bratz are supa-dupa boring without a friend. Educational-wise, they let your imagination SOAR!BRATZ ARE SUPA-DUPA TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not good,"I bought this for my younger sister for her 8th birthday. She loved it.. at first. The hair came out when she tried brushing it (come on, she's 8). And her red shirt turned her arms red. I mean, what is that? She bought another one and she was much happier. That was in August. Still, that doll sits at the bottom of her toybox.."
4,Yasmin,"What I Liked:-Her hair. It's pretty, and doesn't need brushed as badly because it's fixed.-Yasmin herself. She's pretty, and unlike some of the other dolls, the ""attitude"" face looks good on her.What I Didn't Like:-I got this doll when I started getting bored with Bratz, but that's just a personal thing, it doesn't have anything to do with the doll.Worth:The doll doesn't come with any accessories like in some of the other sets, but I think if you're a Bratz collecter/fan you would probably like this. (...)"
4,Great!But...,"This Doll was great in all but for some reason when I tryed on the red shirt on Yasmin,her arms and armpits turned red!I think that was just the Ink.But I just like to put clothes on her and then put a jacket on to hide the red.But still great doll.And a little note to the MGA,You did great but the red shirt the ink got on the Bratz.You need a little work.That's why I put 4 stars instead of 5.Thanks,"
3,Except for all the cliches...,"This was a pretty good film. Nicely acted, beautifully shot, I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did. It's an interesting premise, but once again we've got the hardass drill instructor, the cocky recruit who won't confirm, and a dozen other war movie cliches. Which is a shame, because this could have been a great movie."
4,The Edge / Tigerland,"The Edge was Great! Anthony Hopkins was awesome! Great suspense and intrigue. But Tigerland has ""something to be desired of"". The plot was unclear and the movie in general didn't hold my interest. Would suggest buying ""The Edge"" by itself."
4,Tigerland,I read some of the reviews here and the ones that say this movie is unrealistic I ask you how do you know. My father went through Tigerland and I was born at Fort Polk hospital in August of 69 and my pops says its pretty close to how it was then. My father went to Vietnam. He doesnt like to talk about it and if you ask him about it he changes the subject so for him to even mention this movie to me it must be close to how it really was.
3,No tigers and no heart pounding action,"The acting is good and the characters are enjoyable but it's a ""B"" film with a ""B"" story. Why you say when pretty much everyone else gives it a 5 star. I found it some what boring. All this movie is about is amateur soldiers in a military training camp and that's it. If you are expecting to see a war than don't watch. That's why I'm giving the 3 stars. Colin Farrel is a cool guy but not good enough to get the 5 star."
5,Awesome!,"Colin Farrell won me over with his acting in this film. It is little known by most that Tigerland itself was a Vietnam training Camp for soldiers about to go to combat. Farrell's character is one of great influence in the movie, and as an ROTC cadet, and (hopefully) soon to be second lieutenant in the United States ARMY, Tigerland is a great film that did not get the recognition is deserved! See it!"
1,...military 'stereotypes'? Not even that.,"After seeing the movie, I was shocked to discover that it was 'based on' a book written by someone who had been through Tigerland himself and served a tour in Vietnam during the period depicted in the film.It would seem that 'based on' leaves a lot of room for artistic liberty. Perhaps the film makers should have set aside more of what was clearly a small budget for the services of a military consultant ...maybe then they wouldn't have referred to a field phone as a 'radio', have been more accurate with the uniforms, and not relied so heavily on dialogue and mannerisms that could have only been based on what someone who had never spent a day in uniform 'thought' soldiers spoke and acted like.This movie needed the services of Dale Dye ...badly!"
5,"5 stars for Bart the Bear, zero for Alec","I'm not a fan of Alec Baldwin, in fact I don't want to support any garbage he is in. However, this movie was GREAT mainly for Bart the Bear and Anthony Hopkins. The acting wasn't the best, but the film had some great scenery. Hard to believe that Bart the Bear was really a kind bear...that's just how good of an actor Bart the Bear was (if only Alec Baldwin would have learned a thing or two from Bart people wouldn't think he was an annoying actor). Older children and adults will love this movie, but don't buy it if you think the acting is good. The only thing missing here was Youk the Bear! Enjoy"
5,Tigerland review,Tigerland is a movie that will especially appeal to veterans that served in the U.S. Army during the Viet Nam war. The plot is not the best but the training sequences represented in the film are very realistic and do bring back a few memories of basic training in the sixties. Most anyone can enjoy the film but it will appeal to the age group that went through that experience more.
2,Boring,This movie is boring as far as war movies go. For people looking for entertainment don't bother watching this film despite some of the more critical acclaims given by film review buffs. You will be disappointed.
5,AWESOME FILM!!,"Colin Farrell should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie! What an outstanding bit of acting! And it helps that he makes my knees weak when I look at him (WOW!)!! Anyway, I found this movie refreshing in the fact that it never actually shows you any Vietnam war footage or anybody killing the enemy. All the actors do such an amazing job considering the conditions they were under (no make-up people, no cafe lattes, no pampering, no fancy-shmancy directors chairs for everyone). They actually made me cry for them and care for them all and wish that I could just enfold them all in my arms to keep these poor boys safe! I absolutely LOVED this film!!"
4,A simple yet intriguing film.,"After watching Tigerland, you wonder how did Joel Schumacher manage to direct such a simple yet intriguing film after that horrible Batman & Robin? This film is about the loyalty, integrity, fear and hope of men. I believe that the Vietnam War is simply used as a backdrop. This is an intense, psychological film. The plot isn't that great, but it's what Bozz's character that helps this film a very emotional piece. I'd say Colin Farrell is the next Mel Gibson, if not probably even better. After watching this film, there's something about it that makes you feel good, and you wanna enlist yourself to war. A must-see for all."
1,DVD was scratched....,The DVD was scratched...missed the return window because I did not watch it right away. Disappointing...There shouldn't be such a short timeframe to return an item.
5,Colin Farrell...Matt Davis,"See this movie for Colin and Matt. They are great playing military buddies who train and have good times and bad. For those of you who are fans of Colin this is your chance to see him in the buff (Matt Davis too). Overall, more drama than action it this film. Being a teenage guy I can relate to what the guys did."
4,Tigerland,"Introduces most of us to a new way of filming-Excellent cast of new comers-we will be surprised at who surfaces from this film,not only the leads-Excellent coverage from an angle only Joel could reach"
2,pointless,"This is a real snoozer. Ferrell is fine in the movie but the story is just pointless and unrealistic. I was interested in seeing this movie due to the fact it is drama and not action, but overall there is just nothing deep about this film."
5,this movie stays in your mind,"this was a great movie. it did not put you to sleep, it was not overacted, and it did emotionally deliver.it portrayed the horribleness of war, the brutality of training,and the lives of soldiers waiting to be shipped off to a lost and pointless cause, with all the anxiety that produces."
1,Disappointing performance,"These binoculars are fine at 12X, but almost totally unusable above 20X. The field of view becomes increasingly smaller until at 60X you are looking through a fuzzy peephole. There was a defect in the left optics, either a piece of dirt or a nick in one of the optical units. Ather five minutes of use I packed them up and sent them back."
5,Awesome Quinnell Book !!!!,"Second AJ Quinnell book I read (first being Man on Fire).Thought this one was just as good.It was awesome. The characters in is are just fabulously written, the story and politics in it were great, and jsut the way it all comes together was just great. I loved this book, as well as the other 2 of his Ive read (Man on Fire, In the Name of the Father)Check them out, they are great books, get your hands on any AJ Quinnell book you can !!!"
4,maxell = mediocre,"I would like to say that with this pack so far I have not experienced any problems, but I have previously experienced problems with maxell products on their older CD-Rs. Maxell isn't the greatest brand, but they do their job and serve their purpose. personally, I wouldn't buy maxell for an important job, for fear that it might screw up on me or not burn correctly. for a simple job for a friend (such as copying a cd or copying a file to a disc), look no further. these are great for semi-permanent files. for more trustworthy stuff, look elsewhere though. TDK, Memorex, Fuji, and Imation are good brands for burning media."
3,Go for the Japanese produced blank-media. India-Tiawan AVOID,"Every brand of blank media is made by different companies, other than the one who's name is on it. When you look near the bar-code of any cd-r or dvd+r, they are always made in these 3 or 4 different places: Taiwan, India, Mexico and Japan. From my experience, the ones that work best are made in JAPAN.I'm definitely no expert, and if you use blank media for professional purposes, you should investigate this for yourself. I can tell you that Fuji is always made in Japan, and I've had a good success rate with them for a few weeks (since I learned this). Of course, checking every one before it goes out the door is a good idea, but you never know how long it will last; DVD-Rot is a real problem. Other than that, I would only buy them in stores so you can tell exactly where they came from.And for the love of God, can someone just make a product that will last??"
3,"Good questions, sloppy implementation","I liked the format, especially the spiral binding that makes the book easy to use. The questions are good practice for the test. I was disappointed by the sheer number of typos throughout the book."
5,Very comprehensive review,"I recommend this to my project management students as a good prep for the PMP exam. Not only does the author provide the correct answer for each question, but also tells you why the wrong answer is wrong. She provides good references to the PMBOK as well. I like the test taking strategy in the introduction."
5,excellent,"The author has come up with a new idea of telling us why the wrong answers are wrong. This is exceptionally usefull when you have those ""Fuzzy"" questions where two or more answers look good. This book shows why there is a better answer."
1,"I hate talk fests, especially this one....","I really don't like talky films. They are rarely cinematic, and just come across as an extended TV sitcom. The Brothers McMullen is just dull, dull, dull. The film is way too long, mainly because the conversations are just so BORING. Burns is a good actor, but he's not a very good director. He has no sense of composition. Burns is a poor man's Kevin Smith, in that Smith has no sense of composition either, but Smith's dialogue is much more livelier than Burns's ever will be (I'm not a huge Smith fan, either). I really don't understand why people loved this film as much as they did, and why critics acted like it was the Citizen Kane of its era. If you really want to see decent talkfests, watch Clerks or some of Richard Linklater's films. Richard's films do maintain interest because the talk is interesting at least (but not always successful). Don't waste your time."
5,Great Irish Movie,"This is a great movie, that is about all of the good things in life. Friends, family, and of course love. It explores what it is like to be an Irish-Catholic, and how they live their lives. Edward Burns is plays a charming, cynic who no longer believes in love. WHO COULDN'T RELATE TO THAT? Great movie about everything that is good, being Irish, being religious, having great friends family, and lovers. Edward Burns is a very talented man, who stays true to his Irish roots. If your Irish, or are just looking for a charming film, see this movie."
3,"Not as good as ""She's The One""","I saw ""The Brother McMullen"" after ""She's The One."" I liked ""She's The One"" better but see how it is derived from ""The Brothers McMullen"". This movie doesn't have the star power, but still packs a pretty good punch story wise.The story to me is a little harder to relate too, it seems to be a little more ""specific"" than ""She's The One,"" and that is a slight turn off to me. The cinematography isn't as good and the story is a little more bleak than in ""She's The One.""Over all a good movie. If you are a fan of Indies or Eddie Burns, you should absolutely see this. If you are looking for a more modern, main stream, Romantic Comedy, I would recommend ""She's The One"" over ""The Brother McMullen"""
4,Edward Burns is awesome,"After ""she's the one"" I got curious about this writer/director/actor. And I think He's absolutely brilliant.Great stories, wonderful natural acting. A sheer delight. This movie was another great one.Go Burns!!"
3,Close But No Cigar,"My true rating is more like 3.4 The good side of Burn's film is its low key, breezy humor, and its convincing world of Irish male characters (Burns and McGlone are especially effective) On the debit side is its stereotypical view of Catholicism, which takes away from the otherwise natural flow; and its fanatasy view of women characters who are too often cringingly compliant and in the case of the Bahns role almost too attractive for comfort (great that five women get sizeable roles, but not great that theirs are less complex than the three brothers they are made to be so AVAILABLE for)"
4,"La versión del Vista más básica, para equipos lentos.","Tarde o temprano todos los usuarios de Windows tendrán que emigrar a Vista, y como ya probablemente ustedes habrán leído bastante de este horroroso sistema operativo, no les voy a llover sobre mojado.Solo tengan en cuenta que si van a armar una computadora de poca memoria Ram y un procesador económico, la edición Básica funciona bien. A mi me va muy bien."
5,Excellent story!,"Fast paced and funny, this book would make a great movie! This book is something of a cross between Elmore Leonard, Dick Francis and John Grisham. I hope there is a sequel."
4,Carlson Disk Brake Hardware Kit,"I purchased this product because I was missing one of the pins on the rear brakes. For the price of what I would pay at the dealership for one, I purchased parts for all 4 corners. The part fits just fine. The only complain I have is that the little clip does not fit easily into the position as the original did.I will purchase these parts again. It resolved the noise issue I had in front. I guess the original no longer held the pads in place like they were supposed to.Car is a 2005 Lexus LS430"
2,Misleading Title,"This is not really a ""how to deal with kids and divorce"" book, but a personal memoir of the two authors and their post-divorce situations. It's a good read - particularly the harrowing story about how Nancy's ex-husband abducted her children and took them across the world to Australia. But it is NOT a guidebook. I also was bothered by the fact that Karen handled her parenting in what I thought was a very selfish way. If I recall correctly, she moved him away from his father after the divorce, and then each time the child settled in to a town, with hobbies and relationships, she decided - for no compelling reason - to move someplace else."
4,I'm impresssed,"Frantz conducts the Bruckner #4 & #8, but not #7 & #9. Unmentioned by Amazon, Hans Rosbaud does #7 in '59 stereo and Furtwangler #9 in mono from '44, both all time great performances. I already own both, but will be pleased to give these duplicates to my friends.Justus Fantz had been unfamiliar to me, but for under $10, I decided to take a chance. I am very familiar with many different interpretations of these Bruckner symphonies. I found Frantz refreshingly different and involved. He takes a slow, well articulated, and emotionally sustained reading in #4, with excellent sound recorded live. He also takes #8 deliberately, until he whips up the tempo for a generally exciting last movement. My only performance disappointment came during the coda, when he slackened tempos and lost cohesiveness. Also, this live recording was too distant and diffuse for my taste.On balance, I was pleasantly surprised and even bolded over by #4."
2,Laura was awesome but this cd is not........,"All I have to say is if she were still alive today she would have never let this cd happen like it did. Yes its great to hear the few last songs but I would rather remember her the way she was.........I remember being in the audience while taping SOLID GOLD when she was doing her 2 numbers.......... It was awesome to see her, I was 12 at the time......... Thats how I want to remember her not by this remixed piece of garbage.......... Plus now ""they"" are releasing a cd with Challenge all by itself......... trying to cash in on something...Lets remember her the way she was...... not by making her roll over in her grave!"
5,A MUST for any Laura Branigan Fan,"I loved this CD taking that I've been a huge fan of Laura Branigan for a long time, it arrived quickly and in good condition, I reccomend this to anyone who is an LB fan - you won't be sorry..Amazon is also a good place to buy cd's - their very fast with shipping."
3,"Great Songs, Cheap Release","THere is a good and bad to report here. THe bad....This Cd is cheaply made. Sound quality is not good, and some cheap old photos. Laura deserves SO much better than this. The Good is the songs that Laura was working on are really great. Even with only fair sound quality it is great to hear new music from Laura. We will indeed ""Remember Laura""."
1,Defective,The page for the number 9 (nine) was a repeat of the page for number 6 (six). I checked a used copy at a book store and it had the same error. What a waste of money! How sad that learning books based on so well-loved and popular a character were so poorly made.
4,Adorable,This is an adorable book for learning to count 1 - 10. Great for the Winnie the Pooh fan. Simple concept of learning numbers.
4,Delightfully spooky - not too scary for toddlers,My daughter (just turning 3) is enchanted with this movie because it is just the right amount of scary... enough to intrigue her but not so much that she gets really scared. She identifies with the characters in that she understands being scared of the dark. It has helped her overcome some of her fears. We have watched this over and over and over.
4,Very plesantly surprised!,"I decided to buy a couple strawberry shortcake movies when my 3 year old daughter received a bunch of Strawberry shortcakes for her birthday. These are very cute movies! They have a couple of cute songs, fun storylines and great messages."
2,Too scary,"It was too scary for my little girl. I would recommend for girls over 6 years only. Seriously. We haven't slept thru the night after watching this. If you choose to get this anyway - my simple recommendation is to watch the entire movie without your child before showing it. We love all the other strawberry shortcake dvd's... this one just didn't fit the mold of cute, happy, etc, etc that all the other dvd's use.The dvd introduced many more concepts than I thought it would. Lots of reasons to be scared. Especially the dark. Every kid is different, and it just didn't work for us. We will never watch this movie again."
5,Awesome CD,"TNT at their best. I've been following TNT since the beginning. All of their CD's are excellent, but this one stands out....Favorite songs are Purple Mountain, Rock and Roll Away, and the first four...in that order. I only give reviews to music that I feel deserves 5 stars. I recently listened to this again because of the unfortunate death of keyboardist Dag Stokke. This was the first studio CD that he appeared on, and he stayed with the band until his passing. R.I.P."
5,A CD you can't find in local stores.,I got this for my husband's birthday. He was very excited I found it for him. I had no doubt I was going to be able to find it on Amazon. Amazon is a great resource for many things. Glad you are available.
1,Why doesn't the world just end?,"It blew my expectations into a million pieces, much like the million pieces of fragmented plot and poor acting. One 80 foot snake can fit into a box the size of a refrigerator, and still have room to coil and attack male nurses who are inexplicably in a military base.It is interesting to note that of the list of four cast members profiled in special features, one is in the first ten minutes of the movie only."
3,Entertaining but shallow,"Its an OK low budget sci-fi horror film but it does not have much to show off. The FX are average and the acting is a little below par. The story is ok, good enough to be made. but its a grain in the beach of terror films."
3,"cute, but not too effective","not only was it difficult to get my kitty to hold still long enough to hold each individual claw cover on while the glue dried, (which is of no fault of the product, simply my bad kitty) but after all that hard work, these things don't last long at all. they easily come off and stay on (at least for my cat)for about 3 days tops until they start to fall off the nail. i find random red kitty claw covers in various places in my apartment (food dish, sofa, bathroom) once they start detaching, unless the kitty eats them first (which she has done and i find in her litter box). they seemed like a good alternative to de-clawing. it is apparent now that they are not. you'd be well advised to purchase a handy pair of clippers and just blunt the claws instead."
2,not pleased,When i recieved them they are cheaply made compared to the ones i normally buy. I will be going back to the ones i normally do. These lasted not long at all
5,Excellent Band!,"I have been wanting to write a brief review of this CD since I first heard it back in late August. It took a little while to grow on me, but after listening for the last couple of months I discovered the treasures of this music. The main reason I decided to purchase it was because I am a huge fan of Fates Warning and with Ray Alder doing the vocals how could it miss! I was not familiar with the rest of these guys. The band does remind me of a cross between Dream Theater and Fates Warning, although I have to say that this CD is not quite as good as FWX. To me that was the ultimate Fates Warning CD. However, this CD is definately worth owning. Very interesting songs with lots of nice twists to the music, performed flawlessly."
5,If you like Fates Warning and Dream Theater try this!,Great ablum. Even better to see them live! If you like Fates Warning and Dream Theater try this!
5,An Amazing Album,"This album is musically consistent from start to finish. Every track on this album is is a keeper, no filler tracks. The musicianship is flawless. One of the best groups to come out since Dream Theater. I rank them up there with the likes of Dream Theater."
4,Fantastic stuff..but..,"Oh my god, the lyrics are horrible! Cliche after cliche! The music is still excellent, though, thankfully. If you can ignore them buy this CD. It's still worth owning."
2,A Dickensian prog-metal release,"Dickensian, as in this recording presents the best of times (musically) and the worst of times (lyrically). Like, I suspect, a lot of metal/prog-metal listeners I don't place the highest priority on the vocals and lyrics. Let's be honest, there are a lot of earnest but slightly goofy lyrics in the genre. But this one from Redemption... wow. It sounds like someone singing another person's diary entries, and they have no clue how to make it musical or, you know, lyrical. Simply awful. It's very frustrating because the music is quite good, heavy but intricate and all that you probably like to hear in a prog-metal record, but the lyrics are too bad to simply ignore. It's like trying to have a sip of your favorite drink while someone kicks you in the groin."
3,Nothing earth-shattering,"Since I'm a big Symphony X fan, I was thinking I would get a bit of the same. Unfortunately I didn't realize that Jason Rullo did not play on this album, and it is evident. While Chris Quirarte does an admirable job, his prog rock licks sounded a bit too technical and didn't have much creativity to them. Overall, though, I do like the album, especially the first track, ""Threads"", which provides a nice intro. The third track, ""Scarred"" was a bit misleading as I was expecting the same intensity of Dream Theater's song of the same title."
4,"Complex action film, but not sci-fi classic","If you're looking for another Blade Runner or A.I., you won't find it here. This film is complicated, but is much more of an action movie than the latter are. Minority Report has many chilling scenes, many great ideas, but it moves like a classic action thriller/mystery. In other words, the focus is on plot and action, not on exploring ideas like great sci-fi does. Overall it is thought-provoking and sytlish, and just shy of being a sci-fi classic."
3,Lighten up and enjoy!,"I've been amused in reading the pseudo intellectual reviews about the so-called ""plot holes"". Here's a suggestion, don't expose your inability to analyze or understand the movie or genre. Take the movie for what it is ---a futuristic Sci-Fi murder mystery. Without ticking off each ""plot hole"" that was listed, I can tell you that each is explainable if you looked a little deeper, except maybe the merry-go-round question. Here's an inconsistency you may have missed(oh my gosh---does this then make it a BAD movie?---NOT), early in the movie while working at his high tech precrime desk, Anderton's right hand reveals scabs on his second and third knuckles(I guess he was hitting the bag late the night before), then in a scene seconds later those same knuckles have unblemished skin.Bottom line: While not the best movie I've seen in my life, it was entertaining and worth the price of admission."
3,what?,"entertaining at best, this future film about cops being bad guys and the good guys wining in the end is not much and not worth your money. The story plot and writing was wonderful but the acting didn't measure up at some points in the film. And the people in the water was a little over the top. It's something to at least check out!"
1,Greatness through name recognition,"I'm sorry, but this film did not live up to the hype. The special effects were plentiful in this movie, but I guess paying Tom Cruise ate into the budget a little bit because the CGI was sub-par.The name of the film is probably the most ludicrous part. There is no mention of a ""Minority Report"" until half-way through the film. By the time it is mentioned, it isn't twenty minutes until you find out that there is no ""minority report"". So the title has no bearing on the film to begin with.This is a movie which owes it's success and hype to 1 thing...names. Tom Cruise, I mean come on. Who doesn't want to see a Tom Cruse movie? Well, not me anymore. And then there is Steven Speilberg...the man behind that lovable E.T....can't seem to churn out anything lately that is worth a hoot. This is truely a film on par with A.I.......hey, ""A.I"", ""E.T"", perhaps this should be called ""M.R."" for the director's cut.Save your money. If you must see it, wait for HBO."
1,Shows how out of touch critics are with reality,"How does this movie get such good reviews from critics? I suppose it helps to have Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise's names attached. But let's call it like it is - this movie is lousy. It was so boring, I was praying for it to end."
1,Unethical,"Ok, this move gets a little too futureistic with the pre-cogs and other things. It thouraly grossed me out."
4,"Great movie, tired of Tom playing Tom","I loved this movie's special effects but I get so tired of Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise (I kind of feel the same way about Harrison Ford too--at least Tommy Lee Jones can swing between drama and comedy). Any of a dozen actors could have played this part, and maybe even given a break to some talented up and coming actors for a change--could have been big break for them. Well anyway, one part I enjoyed was seeing the future of advertising (I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say, for those who think they have found every way they can reach us to encourage us to buy, they haven't). I think this method could very well be done in the not too distant future. Spooky. I liked the ending myself, I don't find Spielberg's moralizing offensive. The future of incarceration was also very interesting too. Again, won't spoil it, but I could see this being done too.Worth seeing."
5,Minority Report delivers...,"The movie itself is a feast for the eyes, with many futuristic and imaginative things thrown in by Spielberg, my favorite being the spiders. Despite several plot holes, the movie gave me a sense that this could actually happen.The DVD itself is great, the extra features are interesting and enjoyable and I would recommend this to anyone who'd like a glimpse of the future, from the mind of Spielberg of course."
2,GREAT....If you never read the original story.,"Why, why, why??? Why not use the plot from the short story in the movie?? Spielberg was ""keeping it real""....real dumb. I guess we were not supposed to miss the original theme and plot of the book due to all the neat special effects. And the ending? Typical Spielberg - don't believe all the ""dark atmosphere"" hype, its a joke.Read the Philip K. Dick short story instead."
4,This is Hell of a movie,Dude this is the coolest movie ever Tom Cruse is great in it and dude this is one dark ass film I mean it doesnt really even have a happy ending but the action and plot is good. So Rent it see if it's good for the kids my opinion is 14 or 15 and up condiderng it has a grousome for a PG13 eye removal and more violent than much and a theem of Rape of a small child
3,Don't Compare it to the Book,"It is a fairly good movie, but it completely twists the message of Philip K Dick's story. If you've seen the other PKD movie adaptations (Next, Paycheck, Bladerunner, etc.), it is very similar in character."
3,A decent movie,"But I'd suggest the police station disable the security clearance of suspects. No less than three times Tom Cruise (and his wife) were able to get into the most sensitive areas of the police station using his eye balls. In the remake that will follow in the next ten years, I'd recommend closing this plot hole by having the protagonist use acrobatics to enter the police station. Include laser trip lines and pressure-sensitive floors without discretion."
5,"Tom Cruise is the best - ""scary"" movie","Love this movie - if you like Tom Cruise you'll love it. Also sort of a modern ""1948"" movie. Saw it in the movies and again on a DVD."
5,"Spielberg's best work since ""Schindlers List""","Easily the best film so far this year, ""Minority Report"" is well worth the money and the time of even the most casual moviegoer. MR is filled with entertaining and unexpected plot twists, as well as enlightening predictions about the future of the American criminal justice system and the basic future of the human race. Most important, however, is MR's thought-provoking messages about fate and pre-destination. ""Minority Report"" is a very fine film well worth the hype. I couldn't recommend this film more."
5,Pleasure to Watch,After watching AI I was truly disappointed in the direction Stephen Spielberg. Minority Report was a relief. His time and effort for depicting the future with his weekend think tank with some of the great minds in many different areas made of a convincing movie. I love how computer enable directors to bring realistic dreams to the movie screen. The story is just as incredible. It reminds me of the old Twilight Zones or a great Alfred Hitchcock. The picture is great on this DVD. Using a type of desaturation a crisp blue formed. The special Features found on disc two are amazing. My biggest problem with many DVD's is the lack of cooperation by the director and cast. Here Stephen Spielberg takes his time to explain his vision along with his other constituents. This is a buy. You will not be disappointed. The man delivers again with a breath taking film.
3,Spielbergian ending strikes again...,"Despite the unfortunate fact that the villian of the movie can be determined within the first 15 minutes, this is an excellent flick that caters to my personal Johnson of time travel. The implications of knowing the future and the paradoxes created by altering the forseen are wonderfully explored - until the last 15 minutes. At that point, what I like to call the ""Spielberg AI Complex"" sets in and the movie wraps up all of the loose ends in a happy fashion. Everybody gets what's coming to them and all is right with the world. It's all a little too Disney for my taste and seriously detracts from what could've been a top-10 all time film."
1,Will not play on any devices I have,"Ordered 4 of these and none of them played on my computers or my dvd players. all I got was black screen and then shutdown.Returned for replacement, which was done promptly but same result. will have to get this from another supplier."
3,The book was better (of course),"As Sci-fi movies go, this is a very good one. As something that makes sense, even with the requisite willing suspension of disbelief, give it a pass. There was a logical consistency within the story by Phillip K. Dick that is blown when Spielberg felt compelled to completely alter the foundation for his movie -- for example, the whole meaning of a ""minority report"" and whether there was one or not is a pretty major overhaul of the theme that ruined the ending of the movie."
1,"Blood, guts, gore warning!",This film is rated PG-13 -> there is no way this film is appropriate for a 13 year old child. It is totally disgusting. Do NOT watch this
4,Love the movie But...,"THe ""widescreen"" copy I got is really a wide screen image on a 4:3 black background."
2,"All special effects, poor storyline, poor movie",Rent if you must but don't waste your money on buying this one. The story is lame. Special effects are sooo unrealistic.Very disappointed.
5,WOW!,"Being a huge PKD fan is not necessary to enjoy this film. Tom Cruise & company really deliver the goods in this one. It keeps you totally engrossed from beginning to end. The action keeps you jumping throughout, and the mind of PKD is evident throughout. This film is the ultimate tribute to Phillip K. Dick's imagination, phobias and genius."
5,Breakthrough for Cruise,"I don't have to explain much to tell you that this is a must see for even non-Tom Cruise fans. The movie was perfectly directed to portray a not so distant future and, unlike other ""flying-car"" futuristic movies, Minority Report is in touch with the reality that we all will still be walking instead of flying, taking the bus\subway...to work. I have to say this on my ""to buy"" list the day it comes out."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH SOME CHANGES,"The original short story needed some expanding to turn it into a two-hour movie, of that there is no question. So the plot gets a little complicated, but there's nothing wrong with that. But the last half hour plays like a dream, or a very odd joke. Up until then the film is reasonably suspenseful and fascinating to look at. Cruise is in his MISSION IMPOSSIBE rather than his MAGNOLIA mode, which means he is simply playing his good old matinee self. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Spielberg has done much better, of course. But this is what the man is turning out today, so you either go with it or you don't."
2,This is a weak movie with a few good action scenes...,"Somewhere I heard that this is supposed to be as good or better than the Matrix, nothing could be farther from the truth. The good...it has a few cool scenes like the car rides, spiders, computer displays, chase scenes...that is not enough to make a movie good, it needs something else...can Spielberg say ""good story/plot?"". Special effects are pretty good, but I have seen better. The bad...the plot is very dull and stupid. It is all about how one man trips out over and over and over and over about his missing/dead son that dissapeared 6 years ago. The other part of the plot is about who killed the mother of a super future seeing psychic. Someone frames him, he runs and that is when you get the good action scenes. It has lots of talking and it leads not to something grand but in the end it is just another ""who done it"" movie. Dont waste your money in the theaters like I did, just rent it...if you MUST see it in theaters PLEASE see the matinee..."
5,Another masterpiece by Spielberg!!!,"This is the 2nd best movie of 2002. It has ver good acting, great story, incredible visual effects, and the perfect soundtrack. The movie is set in 2054, with its central premise of ""Precrime"" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human ""precogs"" capable of seeing the future. That's original, so I knew I'd enjoy this. I was at the edge of my seat in awe of how great this movie was, and it wasn't even over! Anyway, as Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. He makes one heck an escape, even has his eyes changed! Making good use of astonishing special effects, Minority Report brilliantly extrapolates a future that's utterly convincing, and pretty dang cool if you ask me. It knid of reminds me of A.I Artificial Intelligence. You must see this movie, it is so good. BUY IT NOW!"
2,"Lots of Bells and Whistles,","but that's about it. Some of the effects are really cool to look at, but the mixture of mod-tech with a realtively visually unchanged rest of the world looked off to me. Also, the story is pretty pedestrian in spite of it's excellent premise. Underneath all of the fancy gadgets and clever lights is the same old tired mystery that is too easy to figure out. Cruise is neither a great actor nor action hero(although he does display some good pantomime skills)and should start to rethink his carreer choices. Anyway, it's fun to look at for the first 90 of its' 225 minutes."
2,Well.....,"I am a huge Speilberg fan, and i was very disappointed at this flick, i found my-self struggling to stay interested, the bottom line? It was to long, to long for its own good, i am glad i did not go see this in the movies, cause i would have for sure dozed off. The dvd set has great features on it, i guess if your a fan of Tom, you should get it, but i would recommend renting it first, then see if you want to buy it, cause it's defitnitley not a film you'll watch over and over again.IMO"
3,"Not a great movie, but something to watch.","First thing... when we first see DC of the future (only about 50 years) the vast majority of the city is ""futuristic"" including streets for automated vehicles, rounded buildings we've come to love in futuristic movies, retinal scanners, walking talking holograms, etc, etc. Mankind did all this in about 50 years? What a jump.As for the film, I'll give you that it does have plot holes. The eyeball trick to get Cruise into the police station after he got ""convicted"" for murder did make me wonder. I mean, granted, all access was given because the computer recognized his retina. But wouldn't someone recognize his face?This wouldn't be a buy type movie. ..."
4,"I agree, but this needs to be said...","First off I'll agree with the majority of the reports posted here about the film, but everyone left off one thing:This DVD should be nominated for the worst extras ever award."
1,Sucks....,one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen and i used to work for blockbuster INC.....
1,"lousy, boring, and underdone","I was truly disappointed in this movie. I had such hopes, and with Steven doing the directing how could it go wrong? It needed a little more schindlers list, and a little less humor, though. It was distracting to be in the midst of an exciting chase/action scene that would be broken up with a scene aimed at humor. Why did he bother? And the ending? I won't give it away, but it ruined the whole thing. The only ending I am looking forward to is the ending of Tom Cruises career. Many said he acted very well in this movie, but I wasn't moved at all. I tried to watch this lousy waste of time 3 times before sitting through it for a whole performance, and I still can't figure out why I bothered. The biggest mystery in the movie is dispelled too soon, and the only mystery left is why people would tell their friends to spend 8 dollars to see it at the theater. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD--I need a new coaster for my coffee table."
3,lousy Blu-Ray transfer,"I love this movie... so, I was very disappointed by the graininess of all the ""white"" in this Blu-Ray transfer... all the other scenes were fine, but this movie uses the stark effect of white in the background to increase the effect of emotional scenes, and there is Grain, I do not know if this means it was over-processed, but it makes it unbearable to watch!"
3,Minority target audience,"It was good. Creepy. Edge of your seat thriller, but it should have been rated R. They had way too many nauseating and suggestive scenes that were NOT suitable for a PG13 movie. Other than that, it was really good."
2,mediocre at best,This movie is mediocre at best. It does have some wonderful elements like the advertising that addresses you by name. It's main problem though is that it's overly ambitious. It just tries to do too many things and doesn't do half of them well. The nods to Blade Runner and Brazil are unmistakable and inferior. On the other hand it's much better than the mess that was A.I.
2,Not very good,Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are capable of making much better movies than this. It was O.K but I certainly would never watch it ever again it is a little too long and overdone. The color of it for one thing was annoying it was dark blue and tinted looking. Movies like that are terrible once you get out of the theater try driving home in the bright sunshine after watching this movie. I hope the future never gets this annoying. If you are into future type movies that are real space age looking this kind of movie may suit you Spielberg needs to go back to movies like E.T and Back to the future and Cruise should go back to plots similar to stuff earlier in his career. This movie bombed.
1,Disappointing and Cliched,"After reading many great reviews of this movie, I was very disappointed when actually trying to view it. I found it predictable and cliched. The scenes are depicted like all 'future' type scenes where the living environment is done in silver and black. As if no one in the future likes to live in soft, comfortable environments. I just think that's stupid. I found the entire plot weak. It was a little more harsh than it needed to be as well. Cruise was fine, as always, but nothing that stands out. Overall a real bummer. Not worth buying in my opinion."
1,COP OUT..........?,"A great deal distracts from this simple story, especially the in your face 2054 commercials ...... all of this could be said in far less time.AND are we still paying homage to Kubrick [the soft, misty focus], or is it a colorized Lang, maybe even Dreyer [especially the Samantha Morton/Falconetti/Maria-Metropolis look]?Ridley Scott said it much better in the earlier and far superior ""Bladerunner"".You just don't feel anything for the characters. And what's with the Medusa plants, and that stuff? AND what's also with the ""Seventh Seal"" reprise on the balcony at the end - complete with the original Bergman star? [The Hooded 'death-figure'???]Even 'Logan's Run' gave more fun.This one's awfully close to being a prequel to ""A.I.""Granted Colin Farrell and Samatha Morton bring a fresh breath to the screen, but the rest ...... all sound - little fury, emotion or anything else."
1,Boring and Confusing,"I hate to go against the majority but the best two words to describe this movie are in my title. I'm just glad I saw my friend's DVD before I wasted any of my money on it. I think Spielburg should stay away from adult science-fiction. Everything looked like it was lifted from another science-fiction movie. I know that that is very common in sci-fi movies but when you mix unoriginal effects with a boring, confusing plot, and actors that probably shouldn't be there, it makes for one stinker of a movie. Sometimes there movies that you don't completely get on the first viewing but you want to watch it again to figure it out, this is not one of those movies. I just don't see why this movie was such a critical hit. I believe if it where done by anyone else but Spielburg and Cruse it would have been panned like it should have been."
1,A real stinker,"Just awful. This is one of those ridiculous, nothing-but-loud-noises action movies with little plot and less point. The basic premise seems like a good idea, but it's quickly abandoned, and the story becomes an oh-so-conventional revenge flick with the bad guy obvious from his first appearance. The movie reminded me a little of L.A. Confidential except that L.A. Confidential was a far superior movie, and it was in color. ""Minority Report"" might as well have been shot in black and white, as nothing but black and neutral shades were used, even in the greenhouse. Wait a minute. There were the balloons (like the little girl's red coat in ""Schindler's List""), but that's it. Tom Cruise was once an actor, but this movie didn't require any acting, so he didn't do any. He just looks stupid. How can he watch himself in this kind of dreck? I was stunned when I heard Roger Ebert say it was his favorite movie of 2002."
1,Spielberg in decline,"Spielberg has obviously bought into the Hollywood mindset that the more gore, the more gross you can be, the better. What happened to his great storytelling ability?! What a disappointing movie. If you like graphic violence, if you enjoy watching snot dripping and people eating rotting food this movie is for you. And if you believe we will be driving cars up and down the sides of buildings in 50 years, you will believe this unbelieveable movie."
3,To confusing,"The plot was to confusing for its own good, and it wasn't exciting enough to get you held up into it.If you want to see it, watch it, you may enjoy it.If you just want a good movie to watch, I would suggest passing this."
2,Long and dull,"What has happened to Steven Spielberg? Ever since he 'went serious' he's produced pretentious, bloated and strangely vapid films like this. The plot is ridiculous. There is a simply horrid scene with a Russian doctor and nurse with a giant mole... I mean c'mon why focus on the giant mole? Is this what watching too much Kubrick does to otherwise competent directors??? To think this guy once made Indiana Jones.Spielberg is a one-dimensional and not particularly artistic director, he should not endeavour to make 'edgier' films because the result is stuff like this, neither edgy nor entertaining, just self-involved, overlong and ultimately, boring, which cinematically speaking, is just about the worst crime you could commit."
2,Interesting Concept; execution overblown,"This was an interesting effort; unfortunately, the movie ran about a half hour (or more) too long.It should have ended when ""Anderton"" was captured andand imprisoned in deep freeze -THE END - rather than using every alternate plot twist and ending they had apparently filmed, stitched together."
2,Awful Minority,"I may be in the minority, but Minority Report is awful. Tom Cruise shines in actual human dramas like Jerry McGuire or Rainman, but this futuristic garbage, this futurramma cop is just a showcase of movie technology without a heart. Vanilla Sky had the same problem. Why should I care about these characters that are so zippy futuristic? Spielberg cannot get science fiction right unless it's for children. His best movie required no computer gyration, Shindler's List, but then again, that movie had a script. I was asleep by the time they put this morph in the water."
5,Loved it ( ... and I know movies) !!,"With an opening sequence of intense quick cuts and camera movements, it was obviously going to be an exciting show; and with the many twists and turns the movie takes, I was constantly on the edge of my seat, literally! The cinematography was outstanding! The plot was complex! And the acting was amazing!Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the book by Philip K. Dick. John Anderton (Cruise) is accused of a murder that he knows he isn't going to commit. So for the next 2 1/2 hours you watch him as he runs away, trying to prove the ""system"" is wrong by finding the ""minority report.""I know I can't wait until this DVD is released in December. It is on my list of upcoming movies I HAVE to buy."
1,I'd need an entire fleet of trucks...,"...as many as I could find just to drive through SOME of the many holes in this plot.For the life of me I can't understand why this film has been so well received critically.My wife and I discussed this film's failures for two full days after viewing it. Once a conversation would begin it would lead us into more ""well what about this"" and ""how did that"" type of threads.Certainly the film was interesting to look at, but was ultimately only swiss cheese.Glad my copy of the Blade Runner DVD arrived a couple of days ago. I could always watch The Matrix again, too. Two films of which I never tire."
1,"Forget watching it, since you'll soon forget it anyhow.",What a boring and silly movie. Don't bother.
1,Boring report,"I can't believe that's a Steven Spielberg film, if you're expecting action in this movie, forget it immediately ! The theatrical trailer is all that you've seen. Only a few minutes of action compared to over 120 minutes of tedious conversation, the film ends with a simple suicide of Max Von Sydow, that's too much ! Dts sound or not, it isn't helpful when the story line is boring."
4,A thriller at heart,"I have to say that I was expecting to be highly underwhelmed by Minority Report. Generally, when Big Name Directors and Big Name Stars get together to make a Big Money Film, only mediocrity results. Plus, it seems that every time you turn around someone is making a film of a Philip K. Dick story.Fortunately, I was wrong. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise combine forces to make what is really a substantial thriller with a science-fiction leaning. The story and the characters are what really make this work--particularly Samantha Morton's performance as Agatha the pre-cog.Also fun are the in-joke cameos (Cameron Crowe, Paul Thomas Anderson, Cameron Diaz) and the references to Stanley Kubrick films (particularly A Clockwork Orange) and other films based on Philip K. Dick stories.It's not a classic in any sense, but Minority Report is a fun, fast-paced thriller with a brain and a message."
5,Great movie with Good Ideas,"I enjoyed this fast-paced futuristic movie. I liked the question proposed in the movie of if one can change one's destiny. This movie kept me on my toes with fast camrea action and well developed main charaters. In this movie the director of the pre-crime unit is fully supportive of arresting people accused of future murders. Until he finds himself being accused of committing a future murder. The chase is on, in the meantime he finds the secret that could shut down pre-crime, he could either ignore it or exploit it to put things arright. The movie was very futuristic but had themes that you can apply to today. Good movie, good actors, and good action!"
4,"Strong tension, crisp acting, but a bit slower than expected","Expectations can shape one's approach to a movie. Previews and the vhs cover gave the impression viewers were in for an action Sci-Fi adventure. Instead, a tense tapestry of intrigue, emotions and--dare I say it--philosopy unfolded.The acting was subtle, yet crisp and often poignant. The plot, though not complicated, was not obvious either. Some guessed correctly ""who done it"" prior to the end, but the story's end was not a foregone conclusion.The technical effects and atmosphere balanced well. It was not difficult to believe that 50 years into the future might look as Spielberg painted it. Likewise, while a tense and somewhat dark ambience pervaded the film, the effect was neither oppressive nor distracting.Bottom line: Minority Report offers drama, intrigue, great acting, and much to ponder. A little more action would have pushed this production up to five stars."
5,Excellent Movie,"I was really impressed by this movie. The story was interesting and I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie. The idea of stopping a crime before it happens, makes you wonder. If you liked the 6th Day, you'll probably like this. This movie is highly recommended."
4,A flawed masterpiece,"Almost there! But the trick is to have the hero cross an inhuman threshold, not the villain. If you're looking for inspirational mythology, you can look at Blake. (The human faculties duel throughout time.) If you're looking for a simple love story, Wuthering Heights is one of the best. (The ghost of Catherine gets her lover, Heathcliff, to die for her so they can be ghosts together forever.) And if you're looking for a writer who has both insanity and love, you go to Horselover Fats in Philip K. Dick's Valis. (Dick truly is America's Borges as LeGuin says.)The fact that Spielberg had the nerve to produce a Heideggerian action adventure is something. But it's just a shade from perfect. However, the special effects were awesome. The car chase was brilliant. Whoever thought up the design for the city and cars deserves an Academy Award."
4,Interesting and Surprising,"This DVD is a treat with the special features.And not just that, ""Minority Report"" is actually quite an intelligent film, if you would ask me. Even if this is a sci-fi action flick, it actually does make us ask, ""What if we could stop crime by preventing it by tapping into the psychic awareness?""While Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor, he does look good in the film, that's all. It's Colin Farrel who makes this film brilliant. And the actress who plays the female pre-cog (the psychic) has lots of brilliant moments in this film.A good film, but not one that would become a classic in years to come."
4,Still holds up,"10 years after release, this movie still holds up. Very entertaining, even seeing it for the 3rd or so time. The kids enjoyed it as well."
2,Majority Distort,"MINORITY REPORT is the kind of film I feel impelled to say I enjoyed: (1) its directed by Steven Spielberg, who arguably is always at the top of his game; (2) the film's script was based on a story written by the seminal Philip K. Dick; (3) the story mixes action and adventure with a 'ticking clock' scenario; and (4) it even has the 'big name star' clout of Tom Cruise behind the leading role of John Anderton.However, despite all it has going for it, REPORT feels incredibly like a good meal turned cold. The premise... is fascinating, but ...the ending is so entirely foreseeable that a viewer wonders, ""Shouldn't I be one of the members serving on the precognition unit?""The effects-laden chase sequences are eye candy to behold (it is Spielberg, after all), and Cruise does stretch his acting beyond his usual aplomb (it is Tom Cruise, after all). The supporting cast goes largely unused; this is a star vehicle picture, and perhaps that's where it's most greatly flawed..."
3,Disappointing film,When I saw the trailer I thought it was going to be a cool film. Unfortunately I was let down. The visuals in this film are very good but the plot is very dark. I expected some dark moments but some scenes I think are just put in for shock value. One example I will give and not too give too much away is dealing with Tom Cruise's eye balls. That whole surgery scene is gross. There was a lot of small moments that were just weird.The acting from Cruise was good. I think he does a fine job and the other members of the cast also good but you don't really see much of them. If you are into the dark future stuff then this film will be fine. Just was not my cup of tea.
1,Gimme' A Break,"Without giving away any of the plot to this film (as if there were one) liberal hollywood has come up with yet another example of its inability to come up with a creative ending to a film. Cruise has proven time and time again that when the weight of a film lies on his shoulders he simply can't bear it. With the exception of Samantha Morton who spends most of the film acting like an epileptic in a see-thru bodysuit. The remainder of the cast cast gives us such bad performances that even Cruise seems lifelike next to them. If you see this film, remember that in the year 2054, there are no computer networks, nobody changes the locks, and even three precognitive kids that can predict murder couldn't predict how terrible this film was going to be."
1,This REPORT is WASTing ur TIME...,"If u watch this 136+min report, u are wasting ur time.I totally agree TAO's comment:""The theatrical trailer is all that you've seen.""and, it's no any new idea...If u like CG/SFX, I recommend:""Johnny Mnemonic"" - the VR Interface of computer.""Red Planet"" ------ the Transparent displayer of computer.""Lost in Space"" --- the Cyber-Spider.Finally, again, this movie is ..., it's a ... Report."
1,Was the Camera man's light meter broken?,"I really don't know what Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise thought they were doing in this movie. The lighting was too bright or overexposed. I suppose it was supposed to put me in mind of the future, but all it really did was annoy me. I had figured out who the bad guy was about 1 hour before the movie revealed it. And what about a little better attention to the details. How long did Cruise carry that pair of eyeballs with him and they hadn't deteriorated??? Now if he were such a big criminal, wouldn't they have shut down his access?????"
1,"really good movie, very lame DVD","For some reason, the lighting on this DVD doesn't match the movie shown in the theatre. All of the light colors are amplified to a very bright white and the darker colors are hidden in black shadows. Everything has an intense aura and anything that light strikes becomes a bright white spot on the screen. Background objects and occasionally even faces are hidden by this effect making the movie almost impossible to watch.It seems unlikely that this was an accident. It might be an attempt at art where the viewer gets to use their imagination to fill in the void of intense whites and shadows that occupy each scene...what an unfortunate loss of an otherwise decent movie. Maybe a cleaned-up, watchable version will surface somewhere."
2,"He's cute but,,,,","Tom really has great looks it's just to bad that with each passing film his acting gets worse. I went to see this film knowing of the special effects which i always hate in movies but i did want to see Tom and see how this messures up to some of his other films. To me ""Top Gun"" is the only good film he ever made. As far as production value this film doesn't go anywhere and nothing ties it together except for Tom smiling, posing, and trying to look good and not get his hair to messed up.I've never been a big fan of Spielberg. He tries to hard all the time to make a good film and in my eyes doesn't have much success. Of course box office will always prove me wrong. But i don't think the american audience demands good acting pictures anymore and they count on special effects to pull them threw a movie which Spielberg is good at.I wasn't impressed but Tom is still good to look at. I wonder if he could make it on Broadway?"
1,STUPID MOVIE EVER!!,All I can say is: DON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SCREENPLAY! Or you'll feel you have wasted your money buying the ticket! The screenplay is SO STUPID that I don't know what else to say...
3,overrated-2.5 stars,"When i was reading the review down below about this film being better than 'The Matrix', the soda I was drinking sprayed from my mouth onto my screen as I was paralyzed by laughter. Minority Report is a boring, complicated, and almost cliched story. While I feel the premise is good, I feel too much of the movie was talk, and they did not show enough of the futuristic Washington D.C. The parts they did show didn't look futuristic enough and looked too much like modern-day. And the story, is no more than a sci-fi remake of 'The Fugitive', and not a very good one, at that. While this movie has it's moments, I feel it's not mind-numbingly violent enough, like the Matrix was, and Tom Cruise is an awful choice for the role. Why must Hollywood insist on casting wimpy actors like Cruise instead of somebody with backbone, like Hugh Jackman."
1,Boring and Long,Although the special effects were good I found the film to be long and boring. I kept thinking it was going to end but it seemed to go on forever. Went with a friend and she as well was unimpressed. I realize most people seem to be giving this film a high rating but I guess it was just not for me. Not even the color of the film was impressive as it seemed dark and blue tinted. I would not ever sit through this again. I guess my report fits the title minority report as my views are in the minority of other reviewers.
3,Brilliant Guest Appearance from the Carnivorous Plants,"But the movie? Well it failed to engage the emotions by and large, whilst being more significantly more cerebral that your average sci-flick, dramatic tension was present, but not exceptionally realised, whilst visuals were good but not stunning or overly original. The plot was overly convoluted, but as others have pointed out, didnt stand serious scrutiny.The central premise of the movie, whilst philosophical interesting is not really scientific, though it as a common enough theme in SF. But its exploration of old fashioned fortune tellers in a futuristic guise lacks the social relevance AI might have had if Spielberg had been able to fight of his apparently overwhelming desire to fuse Bladerunner and Pinnochio to the detriment of all else.All in all its worth seeing, but don't set your sights at the highest level, this movie doesnt cut the mustard with the likes of Clockwork Orange or Bladerunner."
4,Almost perfect,"This movie was great until the end. I won't give anything away. But the movie could have had a very ironic ending, but they chose to take it further and end the movie on what most seem to consider a sour note. If they had ended the movie the way you would expect it to, it would be great. However, the package and presentation is great. The bonus disc more than makes up for the ending in my opinion."
5,As Good As A.I,"This film is amazing. The overall feel is somewhere in between A.I and Frequency. It is action packed, full of chases, fights, and mystery. It is sad, and glorious. It is delicate, and bombastic.This is a must see film."
5,"A Film That Is So Real, It Is Possible!","An absolutely spellbinding experience to watch. Chilling to the core. A beautififul portrayal of the future, and great plot based on the novel. Tom Cruise performs better in this film than in any of the Mission Impossible films to date. Stephen Speilberg's genius shows though every aspect of this film. And what better touch than John William's music adding luster to the magnificent camera shots and colors portrayed in the film. Bravo, Speilberg!"
2,Badly cast protagonist & predictable but...,"It was a great plot... a great potential. But Tom Cruise as a grieving drug-addicted father? Plu-eez!! That's why I think it's badly cast. I cared more about Danny in the movie than I did Tom Cruise's character. Great idea, loved the idea of the pre-cogs and would have liked to see more of their work catching pre-criminals etc. and more of the pre-cogs' past. But it was a good story.I figured out who the ""baddy"" was very early on in the movie, so that's why I call the movie predictable. Good story overall, but too flawed."
1,Disc does not work,"Movie disc doesn't work. Movie disc does not work. Movie disc does not work and I'll repeat it one more time, movie disc does not work."
5,Finally on BluRay,"One of my favorite movies that most people have never seen. Its weird how so many techno things have become reality from this movie, I've always thought it was overlooked as a really impressive piece of work.The quality on the BR Disc is excellent. As others have chimed in, the grainy look is intentional in this film (its not a reality tv show!).One thing, I thought this included both the BR and DVD dics, but it doesn't. The other disc is a making of MR which is cool too."
2,BOR-ING!,"Meant to be a copy of The Matrix and similar ""sci fi"" movies, i guess. To me, not much is dumber than a special effects movie in which the special effects are totally unconvincing -- like this. Very little plot, just an intro used as an excuse for another chase movie. Everything is blue, for some reason (another irritating affectation). No daylight ever appears, everyone and everything is blue. WHY? also, the ""futuristic"" cars and street scenes look hokier than Star Trek of 1968. Could not sit through it."
3,Too many plot holes,"This was a good film that could have been much, much better. My main criticism, and I won't say much about it because I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, is that there were too many plot holes. Things would happen, and I'd say to myself, ""How can that be? Wouldn't such-and-such happen?""The film has a great premise, good acting, excellent special effects, and some intriguing philosophical questions. Unfortunately, the plot just doesn't hold up."
2,A predictable and average movie for a Spielberg-Cruise film.,"I expected a lot more of this film, and wasn't left with much in the first place. Basically, most of the plot twists are quite predictable and not very intelligent. Nothing in it really provokes feelings of amazement, except the opening. The surprises and twists that come along are not executed very well. I kept wishing that there would be something to really surprise me or throw me off cue in the film, but it stayed too safe and linear.From a person of Spielberg's calibur, you would expect some impressive content. In fact, you do receive impressive content, but most of that is superficially based and not based on a solid plot. You can predict a lot of what is coming, and in the end it's just a good movie and not a great one. I had lofty expectations because of the people involved with the film, but those expectations were never met."
5,A Very Stylistic Film - AND Tom Cruise!,"If you are a sci-fi nut like me, then you'll like Minority Report, specifically this Blu ray version.Blu ray is made for watching sci-fi and fantasy movies, where the CGI effects really shine through, and for a movie that's already a handful of years old (which is a long time in Hollywood), it's still holding very well with more recent and better tech sci-fi movies out there.Some of the CGI, like the green house scene, are pretty lame to the trained eye, but for the most part it's a very well made and exciting movie.Especially if you're a Tom Cruise fan, you should definitely get this (my 2 other Cruise favorites being ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Mission Impossible 2"" - ""Tropic Thunder was probably his finest role lol but he wasn't a lead so it doesn't count)."
5,Everybody Runs!,"Well some people found the storyline too confusing, but after seeing this film in theaters, I was convinced it is one of the best films of the year. It's a pretty long movie with an awesome plot. The storyline keeps you guessing, and even when you think it's over, it's not. All your theories disappear once the next phase appears. It's definetly a rush, and will keep you intensed until the very end. It's the fugitive in the future. I recommend this product to it's fullest"
4,A Good Philip K Dick Movie,"If you like Blade Runner, Total Recall and/or Vanilla Sky, you would want to watch Minority Report. They were all from the same sci-fi writer. The movie is fairly close to the original story. Like a lost of his stories, this movie is a bit dark, cold and philosophical.I like the movie because I love Phillip K Dick's writing. You may not appreciate the film as much as I did if you didn't read the story. Tom Cruise must like the author very much to play in both Vanilla Sky and Minority Report; and I personally think he did a good job here."
4,Good deal for a good movie,"Good quality movie, however I forgot how old this one actually is (2002). So the Blu-Ray quality is not as good as most newer movies. This was still a good deal for a good movie."
3,"Decent thriller, average sci-fi","Sure, the special fx are fun to watch, but nothing ground-breaking. The acting is good, great in some cases. The film does succeed on the whole. But...The plot is what tripped me up the most here. What could have been a more profound statement on free-will and future-control turns out to be a less-than-satisfying murder mystery. ""Is that all,"" I asked as the mystery was revealed. I found the revelation and the ""point"" of the film anticlimactic.Also -- one major continuity flaw. If the agency was on the look-out for Anderton, how in the world could he get in to their facility TWICE without being noticed? He used his own eyes to get past security. Don't you think that someone in the agency -- a computer at the least, would have alerted them that he was in the building? It almost seemed silly at this point."
2,"Dumbed down Sci-Fi, Easily Digestable by the Masses","This movie was predictable, boring and technically flawed.The short story this movie is based on was written by the same person who wrote the story used in the movie Bladerunner. And yes, the basic premise is fascinating, too bad the movie couldn't build upon this base premise in a meaningful or interesting way. Instead they dove head first into the world of shock and cheese.However, unlike Bladerunner, this movie came off as a typical piece of formulaic hollywood dribble. Shame on the screenplay writer and director for this cinematic atrocity.Quite honestly, the positive critical reviews this movie received still, to this day, puzzle me.It is really a shame, because there was a ton of potential here, not to mention money spent to end up with such a flash-in-the-pan stinker.If you want a GREAT futuristic thinker, then check out Vanilla Sky."
3,Effects 5 - plot 2,"Minority report, set in the near future, predicts a society heavily regulated, policed and fundamentally structured on curtailing civil liberties. The usual background for a SF film set in the future!The film is rather unconvincing, in either plot or thematically. The acting is adequate, though Cruise does appear to lack any real conviction.The effects are quiet superb, which warrants perhaps the real reason for seeing this film"
2,Over Rated,"Ebert listed this as his top film of 2002 and there was even talk that it would be redistributed again for Oscar consideration. Its obvious, Spielberg has a lot of friends in high places. This is a poorly written film with a few excellent special effects. Where as Blade Runner got it right in so many ways, Minority report got it wrong. How about cultural diversity for one; I hardly doubt that the country will be living so ""white"" fifty years from today. Where there any Hispanics or Asians in this film of the future? It would have been nice if there was some plot twist and not such a rosy happy Hollywood ending. How about Tom really being guilty! Thank God Mr. Cruise didn't take the role in the newly released movie Narc because his doing drugs in Minority Report or anything else is pitiful. How about a little grit and dirt? How about less fireworks Mr. Lucas, oh I mean, Spielberg. A.I. and now this, good luck to the viewing masses."
4,Entertaining,Tom Cruise does solid films as eccentric as he is. The concept of the film is interesting and the acting well done. The film as a whole had an emptiness to it though.
4,Good Spielberg Sci-Fi,Very creative futuristic sci fi thriller. I always like to see how some directors picture the future and Spielberg always delivers. His ideas about how people are tracked in the future and how cars may function and the way he presents everything down to the last detail are all plausible and seamless. I enjoyed watching this movie for the third time and will watch it again in the future.
4,Entertaining adaptation of Dick's classic short story,"""Minority Report,"" like ""Bladerunner,"" is based on a Philip K. Dick story (although this time a short story). The plot revolves around a future where murders have almost been eliminated, thanks to a technology that allows the protagonist, John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) to see into the future and stop a murderer before the act has been committed. The plot, which is excellent, is only half of the reason this film makes the list. The film resembles ""Bladerunner,"" in more ways than having been based on a Dick story; the world it takes place in is beautifully detailed and believable, one in which scanners on billboards read your identity and then produce a specialized advertisement just for you. The future portrayed is believable, both gritty and sleek, and the ethical questions raised by the film are especially poignant as we increasingly live a world were we are videoed, photographed, and observed on a greater, and greater level."
5,"Spielberg & Cruise, what a combo","Does Steven Spielberg ever do anything that's bad? Not likely. This is an interesting story with many innovative ideas and gadgets. Tom Cruise makes the whole thing believable. The cast is great including Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, and Max Von Sydow. It's a long movie, but it moves along fine."
5,Great addition to any collection,"This movie is very captivating. I gotta admit, i saw the 2 1/2 hour runtime and was thinking how boring at least an hour of it will be, but I was wrong, action all around. Yeah the beginning is boring (first 5 minutes i'd say) but just like every movie, we have to get introduced to the story. (yeah i love getting right into the action). All the other reviewers already told you the story so i won't dwell on that, rather on the great reviews it has received. Trust me, don't be fooled by the runtime or the ""its a sci fi boring movie"" cause this is a great movie. Definately get this movie as it is a keeper."
5,Wow!,"This is now one of my most favorite movies. I think this is one of Spielberg's best. It's not focused on action, science fiction, or drama. It is a freaky look into the future that has many twists and interesting dialogue. This movie will, or should, make you think. If you like movies that you can't guess what will happen next and where the main character is not perfect; all with an awesome sci-fi twist, than you will love Minority Report."
2,Minority Report is Majority Boring,"Based on a book, this thrill-a-hour movie didn't make any sense. Unresolved philosophical musings abound. Like, if the alien lady saw the future, then how did it not happen? Was she a liar? And who stole his kid? One of those three water aliens? I liked tihs movie less than AI."
2,BORING!,"I have to say i am a huge Speilberg fan, but i was pretty disappointed by this. The premis is brillant, a pre-crime divison, that's a brillant story, but i don't think it was taken to it's full potential. I found myself struggling to stay interested, because it was so long. It's so long it's just boring, some parts of the movie wasn't necessary, it could have been left out to cut time down. If i went to the movies and saw this i would have for sure dozed off. Tom Cruise gives a great performance, as always, but i think this movie was way overated.That's my 2 cents."
4,"Engaging, gripping ... some relevance to today",...I found the movie to be quite worthwhile. It held my attention for the full 2 1/2 hours. The future does look pretty grim and the idea of being imprisoned for a 'pre-crime' is quite compelling. It reminds me a bit of the situations some of the 'enemy combatants' our Gov't is currently holding. How about a National ID Card' = an eye scan. After 9/11/01 some of the issues present seem more relevant.Even though some big companies paid [alot of money]for visibility I thought that the use of technology for marketing by eye scan to be not too futuristic at all. Isn't this just a more advanced concept of web personalization ...?
3,"Not bad, but left me wanting more.","The movie was very enjoyable. At one point I thought I had it all figured out, when suddenly there was an unexpected twist. I think the most anoying thing for me was the washed out color throughout the movie. It seems to be a trend in Hollywood these days to use one over all color such as yellow or green to try and reflect the mood of the movie (for example Traffic), but for me it simply ruins the overall experience. I'd rather be affected by the plot and the acting than color tones. The final scene was also a let down. After a dramatic twist the ending becomes predictable. I give it three stars."
3,Big Plot Hole,How did Max Von Sydow plant the vision of Tom Cruise's future in the mind of the precog? Was that ever explained? This seems like a glaring omission to me.
2,The ending disappoints,"This could have been a great movie. Unfortunately, the place in the movie that should have been the end of the movie was, in fact, just another place in the movie. The real ending, which occurs much later, is a predictable disappointment."
1,Snuggly-Wuggly Speilberg,"My friend put it best when he said that Spielberg is indeed a genius, but a genius with no imagination or originality.When it comes to World War II, there are few better. But as we've seen with his science fiction entries, Snuggly-Wuggly Spielberg always manages to rear his corny head.What could have been a great movie was dragged [down] by an ending that we've all seen before....I swear my eyes were bleeding.This man's movie making license must be revoked."
2,Major logical flaw,"As other reviewers have noted, this movie has some logical flaws. That alone is not necessarily a show stopper. But the problem for me was that the major logical flaw (Cruise's ""crime"" being seen by the precons) was just too big a mistake, and effectively destroyed the movie for me. It's too bad because the movie contains some interesting ideas and compelling visuals, but I felt pretty deflated when I realized that the screenwriters took a major shortcut, which to my mind, means they didn't accord their audience the proper amount of respect. I also generally like Tom Cruise, but I didn't like his performance much in this movie. Part of the reason is probably because Colin Farrell was in this movie and I don't like his energy as an actor."
2,Couldn't bear to watch this rubbish for more than 30 minutes,"Sure the acting was nice, the effects awesome, but this was one boring movie (that's just from a visceral point of view w/o any specifics). One major gripe of mine is that this movie tried being metaphysical in terms of predestination and intellectual time travel. No matter how carefully you craft your plot and script, there's bound to be gaps too big to fill in a couple hours. So if the metaphysics is a deal breaker and there's no other action elsewhere, there's no point watching this waste of celluloid."
2,I watched it!,"I suppose this movie could have been deeper if I was intoxicated but, unfortunately I was not able to get into it as much as I thought I would have.Tom Cruise certainly has a way to catch the audience with his facial expressions and active moments throughout the scenes, but it is not enough to make you sit still throughout the movie. In fact, you would probably want to change to regular TV about 20 minutes into it. There is too much going on for a plot that seems to be so simple... Mystery with drama(extremely exaggerated). I know the director wanted high-tech scenes and special effects...but give me a break. Maybe if the special effects weren't so much, the director could've concentrated more on bringing the authentic storyline out.The conclusion of the movie left me as blank as the emoticon on msn and emotionless. Don't take my word for it, watch the movie. Film is a form of art, but this is definitely a piece that has left a frown on my face and my head cocked to the side.Enjoy."
3,entertaining but,"A respectable attempt, tainted by clean sets and clean clothes and clean actors. where are the drugs? The scene with the typecast creepy doctor is just not enough. this should be remembered as a TOM CRUISE FACIAL ACTING action suspense flick not a PKD movie."
4,A Futuristic look at Crime-- Ben N. at the movies,Steven Speilberg has put yet another title worth taking a look at not only does this film star Tom Cruise but it also stars rising star Colin farrell who does a great performance as a rival who is trying to figure out how (Pre-Crime) works along with this film goes the un-predictable plot with a sense of no other Tom Cruise is frammed and is looked into the future of killing someone that is where the chase begins Tom Cruise will have to do everything from changeing his eyes to out-smarting the pre-crime units every turn could be his last and thats what makes this movie a blast 4-Stars
4,Wonderful Movie,"Although some people take to the tv screen just as much as the Movie screen I particularly enjoyed in more for a larger screen. But besides that, the plot is very enticing and the characters very well acted. But unfortunately I wouldn't buy this to own."
2,Boring,"Though it seems this DVD has been released for ever, I just got it. I was very sorry I did.The plot is okay, somewhat convoluted, with Tom Cruise evading the precrime cops while trying to prove his innocence for a murder he will commit in 36 hours. Odd sounding but that's why I thought I'd like it.However, the filmmaking was horrible. Its either too dark to make much out or its so bright everything has that soap opera glare to it. And the action scenes were also poorly done - at one point you can clearly see a wire on Tom Cruise, and that's without using any DVD features! I was so disappointed with the quality of the movie that I didn't even get to the second disk to see the extras."
3,Interesting Stories!,"The book is well written with lots of stories. I found it to be entertaining; however, I would not purchase again - rather, I would borrow or read library copy. Not enough sustainable material."
1,Pure Crap,"Herzog is a brilliant film maker with masterpieces to his credit. This is an absurd piece of cinema that is not worth anyone's time. Such self-indulgence hurts Hrzzog's reputation and his credibility. The garbage he spews in the commentary is even worse. If you bought the Herzog collection, throw out this disk and enjoy the others. The film is a mess with no redeeming value. The nonsense spewed in the favorable reviews is beyond belief."
2,A failed experiment?,"'Heart of Glass' was quite the daring experiment from the extraordinary German filmmaker Werner Herzog. He hypnotized all the actors except one man; a mystic who is trying to save a village from destroying itself. The scenery is stunning and so is the music. The yodeling at the begging of the film is hair-raising and unforgettable. Other than that, 'Heart of Glass' does not make any sense, espicially the last scene. The final scene has nothing to do with the main story. The final scene has nothing to do with anything in general. Also, the hypnotized actors look goofy and silly most of the time rather than being in a trance-like state. It is a good thing when artists try to experiment like this, but in this case, I would consider the experiment a failure. Watch some other Herzog films, especially the ones with Klaus Kinski."
2,Disappointing and Prosaic,"Before buying this video, I had read the plot and it sounded intriguing. This is a movie that I would recommend you rent before you buy it. In the two or three times I've watched this I've been very disappointed in it. It's not the acting, the movie just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Some of director Werner Herzog's movies tend to be like this one, in that they don't match up to what they should've. This movie is hard to get into and it's a choir sitting through the whole thing. The only thing I found that was of any interest was the scene in the glass factory when they were trying to make the ruby glass. Disappointing."
4,"Wonderful movie & story, it's a pitty not subtitled in Spanish idiom!","This wonderful film was transmitted in Mexico in cinema and some years later in televisón, subtitled in Spanish. In Mexico Jane Froman has had many followers. I had to wait many many years to see edited this movie on DVD. Why was not included subtitles in Spanish? It would have had much more demand for sales. A serious error omit the Hispanic speech. A film will embrace you from the beginning! Don't miss it!!!"
4,A Grand Finale,"I watched ""With a Song in My Heart"" the other day and I wouldn't have bothered to write a review of it except that I was blown away by the USO-style musical finale. The movie itself was a standard Hollywood inspirational biography and, in this case, I hadn't even heard of the subject. However, I got to hear a lot of Jane Froman because it was her voice that we heard coming out of Susan Hayward's mouth. (Incidently, wasn't that an awesome lip-sincing display Miss Hayward put on!?!) Anyway the movie moved along with the help of David Wayne and a lot of very good songs (but not much else). However, the last major scene was of Miss Froman singing to GI's at a hospital (somewhere in Europe if I'm not mistaken). The resulting assortment of American-themed music and the style it which it was delivered stole the show. I watched it on Veteran's Day and, inasmuch as I didn't do much else to celebrate the day, I came away glad I watched ""With a Song in My Heart""."
5,The Voice of the Superb Jane Froman on Home Video!,"Finally the voice of the superb Jane Froman has been released on this wonderful home video! Truly the greatest American singer! And what a selection of songs in the most exciting musical arrangements that she ever recorded!This movie depicts Jane Froman's life from the time of her early radio career up through 1945, the time of her USO tours, two years after her plane crash.Jane Froman worked on the film set as technical advisor, and the result was that this probably was the most factual of the Hollywood biographies of that time period.Susan Hayward, Thelma Ritter, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, Una Merkel are superb in their roles. Robert Wagner's first film appearance. Robert Easton has the comic role of a Kansas soldier who didn't know who Eisenhower was and who was one of a group of soldiers who go AWOL to follow Jane Froman throughout Europe. (Yes, this really happened.)Buy this movie for the ultimate Froman and Hayward experience!"
4,On DVD at last,"I had very fond memories of seeing this movie on broadcast TV many years ago, but thought it would never make it to DVD. It has and it's a pleasure to see. It's a little corny in places - even by the standards of movie musicals - but the actors carry the day and the great standards sung by Jane Froman (dubbing Susan Hayward) are expertly handled by the great Alfred Newman, who received an Oscar for scoring of a musical picture. I have no idea how close the screen story is to Froman's real life, but it doesn't matter. The color and sound on this DVD are excellent, as with all the 20th Century-Fox musical series."
4,A favorite adolescent movie,"This was a favorite of mine when I was younger. Jane Froman had a lovely voice and I still enjoy listening to her sing. The movie took me down memory lane for a while and it created a pleasant experience beyound itself. Of course, it is a bit dated--not a lot of action but good, light enjoyment."
5,Susan Hayward is dynamite!,"Until I viewed ""With A Song in My Heart"", I thought Susan Hayward's role in the movie ""Tulsa"" was memorable. However, although this is a musical biography, Miss Hayward brings her own very dramatic style to this film. She is one of the most believable and versatile actresses ever. I am a big fan who has seen many of her films and am never disappointed. I remember Jane Froman as a lady of style, grace and presence. Susan Hayward possesses those same qualities which is why this movie is a hit. I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a really good story and wonderful music to boot!"
3,its ok,this band is from my home town of stuart ive known who they are for some time they even went to my school. there nothing new though they blend bad religion with pennywise theres way better bands here local like R.A.D. and longshot but these guys are far from bad check it out.
4,cool,"I really enjoy what I've heard of this CD. These guys are pretty cool! They're not really that big yet, but if you like punk and are into those ""unknown"" bands this is great. Plus, my uncle just married the lead singer's older sister."
4,Fit great,Just what I needed but if I had not watched a video on U-Tube...I would not have been able to install them
5,Great Product,For me it was hard to figure out how to get the grip extension on the first time but now it is easy and the product is great. Good job Seller!!
4,Great little add on,"Easy to install and is small enough that it doesn't really add any bulk to the sub compact Glock. Would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't seat flush with the gun. There is almost an eighth of an inch gap from the top of the grip to the base of the frame"
2,Works as an extension but doesn't give more room for the rounds.,The grip extensions do the job but they're hollow on the underside. I had hoped it would give a little bit of extra space for the rounds to fit the magazine as well as extend the grip to make the glock 27 have a more stable grip. It gave a better grip but didn't help with the spring tension.
5,Makes the G26 10 Round Magazine Feel a Lot better,"Extends the mag just enough to get that extra finger on there, easy install, cheap upgrade, wouldn't go without it"
4,A must for any G26 owner,I bought 4 of these for my range mags and I love them. They basically turn the sub-compact frame into a compact frame (makes my g26 feel like a g19)My only complaint (which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars) is that I have pinched the skin on my hand very bad a few times when jamming the mag in the gun. If you don't have fat hands like me though you probably won't have this issue.
4,Great Choice,"I've just tried these at the range for the first time, and only the third time shooting this Glock. The grip feels great and really improves the control of the gun. These particular extensions add only the pinky rest and no additional capacity, keeping in line with the gun's small profile. You can add these to your CC gun sacrificing only minimal concealability. They are pretty easy to install with the Glock tool, but I had to find a youtube video to make sure i was doing it correctly. My only complaint is that they slide forward and back a tiny bit, I would say less than a mm."
2,Too small for larger hands,Pearce has great products but this one doesn't work the best for my Glock 27. First it was tough to replace the original mag plate to add this one. And then it doesn't really add the surface needed for my pinky. I ordered the larger one which add two more rounds for what should be the right fit. I'd only recommend for someone with smaller hands.
3,Bad solution,I've purchased the extension after reading only positive reviews and it was my big mistake. G-Man was right - it does pinch your pinky. Or maybe you should have a special pinky like mine. Another thing - the extension adds about half of inch to the gun height it looses concealability in some cases. After shooting the gun on the range and getting some experience I've figured out it's totally possible to shoot accurate without using any mag extension.
1,Unfortunate...,"I hate that this didn't work out, seemed like a great idea for more grip but I found EVERY TIME I fired, there was a little space between the grip and the extension causing it to pinch my pinky finger on absolutely every shot. There was no getting used to it unfortunately so I had to remove it and go back to the regular ol' mag."
3,pearce grips,The pearce grips look good and add that extra shooting hand stability you need. I found them to be very difficult to install. I had to take them to a gun shop to have them installed but then again I am not a gun expert.
4,Pearce 26 Grip Extension,"These work great to get your pinky on the grip of the mini Glocks. I have a small hand and had installed the Pearce 26XL on my magazines. These would be for someone with a larger hand as it's a 1/4"" longer. The reason I gave them a 4 is because of the sharp lip on the extension. If you're not careful it will pinch your pinky between the bottom of the gun and the extension when fired. The fix is to file or drumel it down. Then you won't get pinched. I know someone will say just pay attention to how you grip it and that won't happen and they would be right. But if you don't know this can happen before you use it for the first time it will bite you."
3,Not an ammo extension only a grip extension.,it didn't increase the # of rounds on my gen4 but the reason I got it was to get better master grip on my glock27.
2,bad,"I thought it was grip extention as it says, but its Magazine extention, and if you have 10 magazines you have to have 10 of these, what a dumb product, its not what the title says, ""GRIP EXTENTION"" NOT ITS MAGAZINE EXTENTION"
2,The Beach - Pretty Weak,"This movie starts out pretty strongly but falls under its own weight about 2/3s of the way through the movie when one realizes that the Beach doesn't have any purpose, plot or script for that matter. I found two things particularly annoying about the movie. First, you end up hating all the people in the beach ""commune"" as they reveal themselves to be totally caught up in themselves and having their fun - they even abandon an injured guy in the woods because his cries of agony bring their party down. Second, Leo goes kind of nuts at the end for no real reason (at least that the film provides). Pretty soon you start hoping that he finally jumps off a cliff so that the film can mercifully end.The scenery in the film is magnificent and the actors seem to be well cast. The problem is there doesn't seem to be any point or redeeming qualities to take away from the film."
5,Very Good,The beach is one of those movies that is so different from the movie Trailers. I thought He went to the Island and Hunters also went and try to hurt them. but I was wrong the guys with guns are Neighbours.Leonardo DiCaprio in his first LEADING role since Man in the Iron Mask Was a little sluggish but was good. The Beach reminds me of survior.The Beach is a good movie with good surprizes!The BEACH: B
1,this flicck belondgs somehwre ona abeach far way!,I honestly can;t get why epople have decdiedd to get behind this movie. I'm I the onlty one who thought the plot was laugyhable. the actintg by decaproalea is awful. he czn't act and never wuill be able. i didn't liekthe characters and i didn't want to spend oever too hours watchuing them. i thought the flick was two long! the story wasn;'t starong enough to keep are intterest. i don't thitnk i ever want to watch this flick again
4,probably the best Leo film out there,"I'm not a big fan of Leo but this has got to be his best work. Titanic was ok but this one captures his acting singlehanded. the video game style of Leo is awesome and when he goes crazy its cool. Tilda Swinton has never been more cooler and that hot girl Virgilene is hot hot hot, like I said shes hotl The Beach sparks another great direction from Danny Boyle(Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, A Life Less Ordinary and Shallow Grave). a big pic for Leo fans and he worked really hard and out for this role, good for him"
2,PERFECT BEACH. UNEVEN FLICK.,"The most beautiful of all movie beaches is probably the one in this unsatisfying film with a tantalizing premise and breathtaking, dreamlike imagery, starring Leonardo Dicaprio as an amoral, cowardly pothead who seeks to live his life as a videogame. Danny Boyle directs with a reserve that is unlike his turn in ""Transpotting."" So turn down the sound, forget the story, and get lost in the beauty of a living Eden."
1,This 'Beach' needs to be washed away,"I had the misfortune to view this movie, and it stinks like a rotting seagull. A meandering mess of a flick, with no merits whatsoever, other than some nice scenery. Most ridiculous is the ending when DiCaprio is looking at a pic of him and his fellow beach dwellers after he returns to society, reminiscing about the happy times there. What he seems to have forgotten is that pretty much everyone on the beach hated him, and that he and he alone brought an end to their sandy utopia. Indeed he spends much of his time on the island alone in the woods going a bit loopy. A disappointing release from the director of 'Trainspotting', which is beginning to look more and more like a fluke given that he also made the terrible 'Life Less Ordinary'. Do yourself a favor and watch 'Lord Of The Flies' instead. Piggy's cracked glasses alone are more entertaining than this."
2,Not that great,"Not the best movie he's done, kinda dragged in some parts. The music wasn't really great either but does anyone know who sings the music in the previews on TV? It's a woman, sounds ... uh, african maybe? I don't really know but if someone could tell that be great, thanks!"
4,A Good Movie,"I thought ""The Beach"" was a good movie. It has good actors, good music, and a good plot. It's about 3 teens who are on the search for a wonderful paradise, but all they find is danger and trouble. The actors of this movie acted great and this movie was shot in a good location. So I think this movie is good."
1,"deserves a big fat zero... el lamo filmo, Leonardo","eck. What a waste of talent and scenery. The beaches, tropical jungles and ocean views were beautiful and powerful acting by all... but what kind of crazy story is this? Where is the social redeeming value? Why would anyone bother to make a film like this? The goal is to get laid and smoke pot... Cheech and Chong accomplished this in classic comedies... but an epic about the same topic?... pullllleeeease!"
1,was there a story here?,"I don't know where to begin. If you took out any 3-minute segment of this film and made a preview out of it, it would look pretty good, but all put together, this movie just sank like an anchor. Save your money and your time. If you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio in a stunning performance, go see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and if you want to see Tilda Swinton, see ""Orlando."" Although their performances are just as good in this film, this movie just isn't worth seeing. Stinks like raw fish in the open sun for 3 weeks in a head-wind. Need I say more?"
1,Implausible,"First of all, DiCaprio's acting is pretty engaging in this flick, but that's about it. The storyline is totally implausible, so what's the point in watching it? It's not a fantasy. It's not science fiction. It's not ""based on true events."" It's just a lousy story, put on film. Don't waste your time. There are many, many better movies to enjoy."
4,I liked this one,"I did like The Beach despite of it's depressing nature. It certainly is not a ""pick me up"" kind of a film, but there was just something about the idea of this really happening that is very intriguing to me. I like to daydream and what better movie than to watch to stimulate my imagination. The actors and actresses were great. Tilda Swinton was the ""ringleader"" if you will, (she also starred as the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia) she just has a very believable presence on film that drew me in the movie. Like the White Witch, she had a haunting aura on film. I found it to be like a differnt version of ""Lord of the Flies"". There is always evil among people. The movie could have been made a bit better, but over all I would reccommend anyone to give it a shot."
3,disappointing if you have read the book,As a movie it is not bad. That said this movie really looses the point of the book and changes the story significantly. Having read the book first I almost found the movie unwatchable because the differences are so frustrating.
2,"Beautiful scenery, but...",It is a weird movie. I didn't care for the storyline really. Ewan McGregor was supposed to play the lead on this one. I'm glad he didn't - I like Ewan's work.
1,didn't know a movie could be such a let-down,"As cheesy as the trailers for this flick were, I thought it would be good when I heard about the filming location and all the money spent on it. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tilda Swinton are great actors... but it ended up that the really bad trailer was actually better than the really really bad movie. Starting of w/ a so-so concept, it went down from there. If you've got trouble sleeping, watching this ought to do the trick."
3,Did they get bored half way through?,"This film started off really well, despite being told that I might be let down after reading the book. However, about one and a half hours into it and Richard(DiCaprio) freaks out for no reason! In the book we can see that there is a build up and a reason for his breakdown but the film just flings him in at the deep end. Despite this though the performances from all were good. The soundtrack (check it out)was pretty cool and the scenery was amazing. A really enjoyable film, providing you switch off half way through!"
5,"DANNY BOYLE, OPUS 4","***** 2000. This movie was based on Alex Garland'sThe Beachand directed by Danny Boyle. A young man discovers a strange community living in an heavenly island in Thailand. I don't understand why this astounding film wasn't more successful. I suppose no one wants to see too clearly through its mirror for fear of recognizing oneself. If you really want to see how the pursuit of happiness can lead to selfishness and murder, watch THE BEACH. Now."
5,An Amazing peek into the adventure we are all searching for.,"When I first saw this film, I thought that the ending ruined it totally because I didn't really think about what it was supposed to mean. But, I just recently watched the film again and I can say that the ending to this film, and all the dimensia that Richard goes through while he is secluded from the community, just adds to the intensity of the film. This film made me yearn for and fear a similar type of experience. A must see for any traveler...you know who you are."
3,A Story worth repeating.,"I thought this movie touched on a very good issue that has been talked about before in books and other movies. In this film the main characters are searching for a Utopian society. Something that doesn't exist and is not even desireable. When this nonexistant experience is pursued, very interesting things happen."
1,SMH...shaking my head...,"I knew the priced was extremely too low.. however is this a real legal legit copy of The Beach DVD? Is there anyway possibly this could or would not be a real legal legit DVD ??Please respond with any answers, comments or explainations to help me better understand.. Thanks! :)Have a great day!!"
3,Not THAT Bad,"This movie had some great elements- good acting, a good script, good shots. What I don't understand is why the ""video game"" scene was necessary. It seemed over-the-top. The music and scenes of the beach were wonderful. I thought Leo DiCaprio did an excellent job with what he had, the same goes for the rest of the cast.I enjoyed this movie. It won't go down as the greatest movie of all time but it definitely wasn't the worst movie of 2000."
3,2 Hours of Paradise!,"The Beach was filmed on a beautiful island...in Thailand. The story in this film was weird and I thought they could of do much better! I mean when a movie is filmed on a island, they could of think of some other better ways to create a wonderful film. The only think enjoyable about this movie was the location, it just takes your breate away! I think the book was more interesting and fun to read...if your planning on watching a movie that has a story, then don't bother. If your planning on watching beautiful scenery then I suggest you buy it!"
4,Great Scenery....Poor Story!,"The movie was filmed in a beautiful tropical island, and it took my breath away. Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't great in the film although he is a great actor. I mean the whole story keept you confused the whole time. The director of this film could have been more adventurous and exciting. I still would purchase this movie because the scenery was brilliant, but if your planning on buying this film for the story...the best thing to do is, hang on to your money!"
2,"""Beach""-less","The book ""The Beach"" was really great and had an interesting storyline. But I really didn't like the movie, because it was so not like the book. It had the main area of the plot, but I didn't think the movie had any really suspenseful moments or any great scenes that made the movie better than OK. It could have been really great and even though the actors played their parts well, the movie just seemt thrown together just to release another supposed-to-be-big movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it. I just expected alot more from such a great book. They made a good ""Green Mile"" book to movie. Why wasn't this one better?"
4,Classic Leo,"Great movie, lots of suspense. Not available on Prime or Netflix streaming so I bought it because my GF hadnt seen it. Still holds up !"
1,easily the worst movie ever,"Obviously, someone came up w/ this great idea and had the capital to hire great actors and pay for great sets... the studio signed off on a huge budget for computer graphics, props and salaries... then they got the screenplay and/or director from the classifieds or something. What the? HORRENDOUS MOVIE. Not funny one bit."
1,Parents: do NOT let your kids see this trash!,"This film should have not made it to the theaters, but even still, it should have been rated NC-17. The entire plot revolves around teens traveling by themselves to a foreign country (Thailand) so they can live there forever, smoking natively grown marijuana and have sex non-stop.An EXTREMELY graphic sex scene was totally unnecessary in this film, as was the film itself, which didn't even have a story. This is a film w/o an audience, only teens who adore DiCaprio could stomach this film and they have no business seeing what amounts to being trash for the mind."
4,Impressive,"This movie starring Mr. DiCaprio is actualy pretty good. The script is unique and engaging, and he does a fine job at acting a very challenging role. The scenery is stunning, and the story moves a long at a suitable pace. This film also brings up some important questions about one's 'Pursuit of Paradise', and how that might not always be as good as one might think. But ho-hum, in the end DiCaprio back in the internet cafe, and his efforet to live out in nature is narrowed down then to 'just a wild adventure'. Thus, the idea of long-term alternative living is ultimately portrayed as either backwards, or not pullable, or both. Too bad- one does not have to be a hippy-dippy, pipe-dream freak to unplug for good, and make it work... (Just read Thoreau).But its a good film nevertheless..."
3,"Fun and suspenseful, but some over-acting","I enjoyed this movie once the characters were actually on their way to their beach. Some of the scenery was stunningly beautiful and the music was pretty nice too. As for the events in the movie, there were several things that I didn't understand. Maybe I need to read the book.Another complaint. I was once a big Leonardo fan back in his teenage days, but this movie seems very over acted in several scenes. Just as an example: Richard, played by DiCaprio, is holding the map that he no longer needs, when another character reaches over and ignites it with a lighter. So Richard, with an exaggerated expression of confusion, holds on to the burning paper as long as he possibly can, then he throws it to the ground before smiling his winning grin at the people around him. You'll see. He has more facial contortions in this movie than Jim Carrey."
2,Ok.,"I liked this film for it's absurdity, locations and ....something. DiCaprio, 27, plays a guy who's presumably 17 or so. To be honest, he doesn't do it all that well, but the other actors are fine, though none of them are very involving.It felt like some scenes were missing, a character asks DiCaprio why he all of a sudden went crazy and the audience never found out why either. The movie could have been directed in a deeper style, esp. for the end scenes. I could see it being a book, but they should have adapted it much better than this!"
3,"Definitely Worth Seeing, Especially on DVD","Leonardo DiCaprio is good as a roaming American who along with a pair of new friends travels to a secret island paradise in Thailand. Things go great for a while and then predictably begin to fall apart. Uneven movie is still very watchable thanks to good performances, fine scenery and photography, and some great shark bites. The quality of the DVD is outstanding."
1,Absolutely horrendous!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it to check out the scenery instead of the story, but could barely sit through it. The plot is terrible and after Richard is sent away from the rest as punishment until he can get rid of the newcomers - it only gets worse and confusing. The whole video game scene was ridiculous - what was up with that! If it is not too late, do NOT see this movie, it will only waste your time!"
1,"should've been called ""The Cheech"" instead!",Cheech & Chong were kings of marijuana films. This film set out to more than that and failed miserably. Would have been better to have had Cheech Marin as one of the drug bosses and Chong as the Leonardo's character... then at least it would had the chance to be a comedy instead of the worst drama of the year.
2,"the horror, the horror","Near the end, I seriously started to wonder if it was supposed to be a spoof of ""Apocalypse Now."" A pretentiously bad film full of adolescent images and concepts. The acting is not great. Di Caprio's role becomes embarrassing. I suspect he didn't realize just what he'd gotten himself into while they filmed it. As you can see from the other reviews, the premise of Di Caprio's character had potential and a lot of appeal, but the story went completely lame, fast. This film is juvenile fiction that took itself SO seriously. Too bad it wasn't a spoof. Leonardo Di Caprio doing Martin Sheen. That's a pretty funny idea. Yes, it was."
1,So Boring,"The concept of this film is great-the movie well,-- IT'S BAD!! The problems with this film are many. First of all, we know NOTHING about the main character Richard or WHY he is in Thailand. Yeah, backpacking but by himself? It would of been interesting to see WHAT made him go there? Then once the three stooges find ""the beach"" it just gets way too confusing. How did ""the community"" end up there???? And then Richard goes MAD but WHY??? Who would go mad in a beautiful beach like that?? The rest were perfectly fine! I just feel that the characters were too mysterious. In my opinoin it would of been more interesting if only the three of them would find the island on their own instead of using a dumb map left by a crackhead. It would of been more interesting to see more about the Thai culture, after all it was filmed there! It was fast paced, confusing and boring. The only star here are the beaches of Thailand!"
1,This movie bites,"This movie bites. This movie is boring. This movie is stupid. Leo, you should have made a better choice of material. The French girl was pretty hot. That's it. I've already spent too much time on this imbecilic attempt at a film."
1,Golden Razzie Nominee,"The only reason this film will NOT win the Razzie for Worst Film, Worst Actor, and Worst Director is because John Travolta released ""Battlefield Earth"" in the same year. This film is without doubt the worst film I have personally seen this year. The book was much better than this (which doesn't say much since I found the book to be derivative and episodic). Director Danny Boyle is capable of much better than this. The one star goes to the Director of Photography for some beautiful scenery."
1,Weak,"After 1/2 hour of watching I turned it off. It just wasn't my idea of interesting. Plus the fact that I'm NOT a pot smoker, so I couldn't relate."
3,"Not bad, but too pretty-boy","Leonardo DiCaprio finds paradise on a secret-but-legendary-among-hippies island, but finds out he's one toke over the line when the residents aren't allowed to leave and have to share it with nasty drug smugglers. The movie attempts to be moral by having the happy trippers simply move a desperately ill comrade away to die alone so he doesn't intrude on their party, but it doesn't work. Leo was probably just looking for something to ride out the hype of ""Titanic"" but he's wasted on this movie. Still, if you simply enjoy watching attractive young people in bathing suits, then this one is worth a look."
3,So Bad It's Almost (Almost) Good,"I would not go so far as to say that ""The Beach"" is one of the worst releases of 2000, but obviously it's not one of the best. Unfamiliar with the book (and now I don't think I'd want to read it), I must examine the film. Surely females between 12 and 30 will flock to it because of Mr. DiCaprio; he does an okay acting job, but it's no Titanic. I will give the cinematographer credit; there are some beautifully photographed sequences, but as memory serves, another film set in ""paradise,"" ""Blue Lagoon,"" also had some great scenery and it was a turkey.As far as the plot, this film should be viewed by all those kids who want to take a year off from school to try to ""find"" themselves. There's no such thing as utopia, nowhere to go get stoned 24 hours a day for the rest of your life without consequences. So grow up."
3,Beaching,"Not bad, not bad, this movie would have been better had we seen more rock pools, or crabs, or ice-creams, or fat middle-aged women trying to squeeze into a bikini 4 sizes too small for them, or a seabird staggering around, covered in oil from a Spanish tanker, or some sewerage, or a dog having a poo, or a sun-burned fat man."
1,WASTE OF TIME(BORING),This movie made no sense and the half the parts i did'nt feel like watching. The ending was stupid too. Save your eyesight and your money.
4,Thrilling! I must see! THE BEACH truly is mesmorizing!,"The Beach, starring Leonardo diCaprio is a mesmorizing, tough, elaborate thriller! Acclaimed director Danny Boyle has created a movie that has so much power and mind and leaves' us with the questions at how we would have dealed with the situations these characters did. THE BEACH is smart, sexy and stunningly a fun ride for teenagers and adults alike!"
4,Not so bad,"Though there's some parts of the movie that lag a bit, over all it is a great story adapted from an even better book. Don't expect the same Leo that we saw in ""Titanic,"" because in this flick he portrays a total oppisite from his boat movie. But what this movie lacks, the soundtrack makes up for. Without a doubt ""The Beach"" soundtrack is one, if not the best soundtrack that came out this year with suburb music from Moby, All Saints, and more. If you don't get the movie, the soundtrack is a MUST!"
2,[Spoiler] Fascistoid,"The movie starts OK: the beach and everything, but the end only shows that an ecologycal-hippie-pot consumer-free love based community leads itself destruction and moral decay.Everybody knows that it isn't so: our fathers were hippies in the 60s and they are what they are now, no matter how much pot they smoked, how much sex they had or how much love to ecology they have.The ending recalls George Orwell's 1984: an utopia is only safe in a computer's screen."
2,Great story. Lousy movie.,"The story is a highly promising. Adventure-prone young man seeks adventure in Thailand, finds it but it all goes pear-shaped on him. He ends up on a paradise island hippie commune made up of other beautiful young people with exotic European accents and simply bulging with street-cred. But there's trouble in paradise as good old human nature, here symbolised by sex, intrigue and corruption rears its ugly head. Sounds great, doesn't it?I'm told the book is a fantastic read. Which may explain why this movie is unforgivably cheesy adaptation, with di Caprio turning in a flat, uninspred performnace. Unsatisfying and disappointing."
1,Excrement,"The picture and sound quality is fine. Everything else, however, doth surely blow. I have seldom seen such poor acting. The writing is even worse."
2,"Great Book, Not so Great Movie","I highly recommend reading the original book ""The Beach"" by Alex Garland. It is a wonderful book and definitely one of the best books of a new generation of younger writers. The movie, however, was disappointing. Many of the best ideas, concepts, and characters from the book were either left out or cheapened by the adaptation to film. However, I felt the locations were fantastic and many of the characters were cast very, very well. My recommendation? Skip the movie and read the book."
1,worthless,"Really...""Earth Ponds A to Z an Illustrated encyclopedia"" is EXACTLY that,For example: ""Beaver"", with a picture and explanation of what a beaver is. ""Backhoe"" with a photo of a backhoe and an explanation of what one is. Where is the Cookie Monster and Ernie?It would be funny if I hadn't paid $8 for this POS. It goes in the Goodwill pile."
3,Shipping,The book was fine. The shipping was terrible. USPS took 3 weeks to deliver after it was shipped.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A successful but ultimately rather forgettable independent film which wisely dials down the ""quirky"" factor in order to focus on characters rather than contrived situations, The Good Girl is a decent movie, nothing more: watch it if you like the actors in it."
3,The Good Movie,"Jennifer Aniston leaves her role in the Tv-show ""Friends"" for a while to enter the world of independent cinema with ""A Good Girl"". The result doesn`t disappoint and the story of a late-twenties woman trying to get a (better) life is enjoyable enough. The movie is a ""dramedy"", at times touching and real but also with an offbeat and witty feel to it. It's a film about fate, conformism, change and the results of our choices. Aniston`s character faces a defining moment in her life, though she doesn`t quite know what to do and when, making some decisions that end up affecting not only her but those who are around. She`s trying to get away from her boring, tedious and predictable life in a small town, but she never has the guts to do it, being a victim of her own choices.""The Good Girl"" is a poignant movie, a sarcastic romantic comedy with a twist and a fine work from director Miguel Arteta, a new indie talent worth looking for."
4,The Good Girl,"Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reilly and Tim Blake Nelson shine in this film, but Jennifer Aniston steals the show. She gives a raw and powerful performance. The film radiates with snappy dialouge and sometimes humorous situations. Jennifer Aniston shows that she deserves to be in this business. Stepping away from her dipsy blonde role on T.V.'s ""Friends"", Aniston plays a bored, working class wife, trapped in a seemingly endless job and in a small town. She also tire of her pot-head, physically abusing husband Phil (Reilly). Not until one day she meets a young man at her job by the name of Holden (Gyllenhaal). They find romance, and soon after are caught by Phil's best friend Bubba (Nelson), the concequences could be deadly."
2,Yawn,"Jennifer Anniston is one of my favorite actresses. Her portrayal of Justine, a retail clerk, bored with her job, husband, and pretty much every aspect of her life, was typical big screen Anniston, lots of eye movement, not much dialogue, same performance as Rock Star...I thought the movie was also predictable. She has an affair, up until that time was unable to get pregnant, takes a home pregnancy test, comes up pregnant, husband is elated when only prior was tested at the fertility clinic. Surprise, surprise, he gets the phone call saying he cannot have children while surrounded by friendly well-wishers who are now speechless as Anniston looks on...There were no earth-shattering moments, tepid to say the least and I found myself watching the clock waiting for it be over..."
2,Good Girl....Bad Movie,"Saw this recently at the theater with three friends, and we walked out with not much to say about it. It wasn't awful, but it was fairly unremarkable. Seemed more like a Lifetime movie than a theatrical release. Credit to Aniston for taking part in an ""indie"" film, but it is fairly boring fare from start to finish. I think this was marketed as a comedy, but it wasn't very funny. It wasn't very dramatic. It just ""was"". And the ending was kind of disappointing, in that the character is more or less in the same depressing situation as she is at the beginning of the film. This was not a movie I chose to see on my own...I kind of got dragged into it by a date, so keep that in mind when reading my review. ""Notorious CHO"" was playing in the adjacent theater, and I was really wishing we were there instead."
2,Horrible DVD Transfer - Good Film,"Watched the DVD last night and on my calibrated 50"" HDTV this was one of the the worst looking DVDs I've ever seen. Most scenes were soft and flat, but the dark indoor scenes were the worst. Black areas glowed blue and all detail was lost/washed out. Really a shame since it's a interesting film with several fine performances. I've checked with several others...and all share my experience."
2,"Dissonant combination of drama and ""humor""",Something just isn't right about this film; I think it's the dissonant way the film combines lightness and humor with drama and tragedy. The film seems to expect us to take the characters and the story seriously at the same time it does not.
2,Pathetic lives,"I wasn't crazy about this movie. It's more like an exploration of desperate people in a pathetic part of rural America. It's about how all the people in this situation can't escape from their situation. The plot involves Jennifer Aniston's attempt to find love through a crazy affair and find a new life. Sometimes though it gets a bit too depressing.The acting isn't great. Jennifer Aniston tries to come across as a redneck with a southern accent, but just sounds odd. Jake Gyllenhaal is a bit too odd and psychotic. Oddly enough, I thought John C. Reilly, otherwise known for playing moronic clowns (like Step Brothers), actually fits his role really well."
1,fell asleep.....,....and i've only fell asleep in two movies in my whole 19 years of life.nuff said......
1,really...really bad,"I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It has no happy ending at all and you end up hating each and every single one of the characters. It's about a 30 year old woman working at a dead end job with a loser, pot smoking, husband who doesn't treat her right and she falls in love with the guy at work. She ends up pregnant and instead of telling her pot smoking husband that it's over she lets him believe he is the father of the baby. Why in the world would she want him to raise her child? She found her true love with the guy at work who worships the ground she walks on. When she dumps him he ends up dead and she couldn't care less. She continues to work at the job she hates, stays married to the drug addicted husband and raises the dead guy's baby with him. That's the ending. What the...?"
2,"""The Good Girl"" lacks integrity","I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this movie. Although Jennifer Aniston does a great job of stepping out of her ""Friends"" image, she should have done it in a movie with more integrity. A film that should have been about love, loyalty, and desire for something more than the odinary, turned into one completely about sex. With so much potential and honest acting, it is a shame that ""The Good Girl"" turned out the way it did. I wish I could recommend this movie, but the crudeness of it outweighs all of its positive aspects.So much sex and drug content is a sign of a weak director, who must rely on sexual content instead of the beauty of the story."
1,Terrible movie-how can anyone give 4 stars?,"Good girl is a bad movie.Terrible girlie flick. I regret not walking out. Waited to see why rated so high. Nothing. Transparent boring storyline from minute one. I think girls want to see this actress do well, and be caught up in the fairytale with her real husband."
1,The Good Girl,"Found this movie very disturbing and unrealistic.Jennifer Anniston is one of the most ""Beautiful People"" in the entire world. To think that someone as pretty as her would end up hanging out and sharing life with such a loser, such as her husband and his idiot side-kick, disturbs the rotation of the entire universe. Her acting was top notch but this scenario could never happen in the real world.Some of the scenes and some of the decisions she makes in the film were so disturbing and unrealistic, I literally had to leave the movie theater...."
1,"Don't ""Add to Shopping Cart"" !!","If time is important for you, don't see this movie. Jenny, maybe you were good but the story :(. Boring movie."
1,Groan....,"Despite high expectations, I started groaning at this DVD almost from the first scene. One bogus, Hollywood-fake condescending take on the ""fly-over"" zone of America after another, there's not an honest moment or believeable character in this entire sneering exercise. The best performances in the world can't overcome fundamentally dishonest material. Steer clear."
1,Don't Bother,"I thought this movie was awful. I like Jennifer Aniston, but the story stunk, the characters were seedy. ick. Don't Bother."
1,DISGUSTED,"I can't believe how dissapointing this movie was for me! I love Jennifer Anniston and while she did a great job acting in the movie, I was really let down. This movie had the worst storyline I have ever come across! I truly have no clue as to how this movie got into theatres. Sure it had a few comical parts (especially the lady who gave make-overs, plus a pretty good cast). But I could've wrote this movie myself, I guessed what would happen within the first 20 minutes of this ridiculous time wasting movie, almost in a jokingly way and everything I predicted was right. I learned that just because you like the actors in a movie, doesn't always guarantee greatness."
4,What's a girl like her doing in a place like that?,"Very interesting comedy-turned drama, superbly directed and acted. Jennifer is stuck in a small-town rut, working in a discount store and married to an unattractive, boorish rube (John C. Reilly), when someone more appealing comes along, with unfortunate results. You'll love this one all the way as a drama and character study. Only gripe is credulity being strained a bit: in real life, small-town girls this beautiful, sharp and full of potential do not generally hang around in their dreary little home towns after high school, marrying the ugliest brute from high school and selling shower caps at the Bargain-o-Rama. But let's face it--that lovely face and everything else that Jennifer offers is a big part of the appeal of the movie."
1,"i became ""the good girl""","i was just like Jennifer in the movie while watching this badly written ""comedy"". Bored, angry, frustrated and unsatisfied. what the!? how did this movie get all the buzz? I did came up with a conspiracy theory for it but i will not get into that here. Although you got to love how Jennifer do her little walk in this one, that alone cannot hold up the entire movie. The script was a disaster, it was flat out hmm...flat...well, dont believe the critics and certainly dont believe me neither, go watch it and see for yourself. Don't buy it just yet, go rent it first."
1,Complete Waste . . .,". . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back. the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened. Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive. not quirky or interesting. they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that. and did i mention it was boring? so mind numbingly boring. there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting. i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this."
1,I can't believe this movie.....,"Jennifer Aniston (Friends) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) I figured that this movie couldn't go wrong.....Boy was I wrong.Movie was slow moving, bland plot, predictable results, and did nothing to keep your interest. These two actors' performances were good, but could never be enough to save the movie."
4,Chick Flick For Sure!!!,"Girls, no need to make your man sit through this one with you! He probably wouldn't get it anyway :).....It is a definite keeper! I've watched it several times...If you are a Jennifer Aniston fan, then this movie is worth it!"
2,The Good Girl???,"A bored married woman makes one enormous mistake and her entire life spirals out of control. Each time she does something to cover up the affair, she creates a bigger and bigger mess. Each time she tries to get out of the affair, it gets a little worse and a little harder to do. The emotions run high, and the characters are ridiculously simple-minded. Though the concept for this movie was good, it was quite unintelligent and weak."
2,Didn't do it for me.,"All I heard when this film hit the theatre was how good Aniston's performance was. After viewing this movie, I feel like the odd woman out. Really how hard is it to act depressed? And that accent-Lord help. Gyllenhaal, as always, is astounding. He and his sister are definitely talented and are rising stars. John C. Reilly the underappreciated talent is also good. Aniston-needs to go back to tv with her other friends and stop masquerading as a movie star. I suspect now that Mr. Pitt is gone that will be where she'll get future work. The film isn't a total bust, there are some thought-provoking questions posed but the plot was entirely too transparent. I knew what was going to happen to Holden back when he first started giving her books to read. Overall: It's just not my cup of tea."
1,This is not a comedy!!!!,"The box describes this movie as a comedy. The front states ""Sly, Comic and Touching"". The back says ""A Comedy of Winning Delicacy and Heart."" Other mentions are ""quirky comedy"", ""...comical results.""So imagine my surprise when it turns out not to be a comedy at all. It may be good as a drama, but since I bought it, and watched it expecting a comedy, that is what I reviewed it as. If anything it is kind of depressing. If you are looking for something funny, DO NOT buy this movie!On the UP SIDE. It did have a very little bit of nudity with Jennifer Aniston (not a double)!"
4,Odd,"Being a great Jennifer Aniston fan, I was quite eager to see this film (which had not been released in Switzerland in the cinemas). And I am still undecided whether I like it or not. It does address the problems of having an affair, the reasons for doing it, etc but the conclusion of the film is, I think, too moraly correct for my taste.WARNING : PLOT SPOILERS !!! After having done all those things, this woman chooses the straight and narrow at the proverbial, as well as litteral, crossroad ?... I don't know. It doesn't tickle me where I like to be tickled. I can't imagine which ending would've but then that's the filmmakers problem, not mine.I say ""watch the film"" because Jen is great in the repressed small-town wife act she pulls off without looking like she's trying."
1,Drying Paint,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. Aniston does not succeed in portraying anyone but herself - she talks the same, shuffles her feet, hangs her head all in an attempt to give the image of boredom and dissatisfaction which is exactly what the viewer will get with this performance and movie. I suggest watching paint dry for better entertainment."
2,"Ok, nothing exceptional!","Aniston is just about OK, but manages to leave an impression of sorts! However the downside was that she kind of brought the ""Friends"" method of acting in this movie too! Also the movie does not really explain some of Aniston's actions such as why she told the store manager about Jake's whereabouts ! Sort of a half-finished movie! Not a well polished product!"
1,Thsi Movie SUCKED !!! She should have been Killed(Aniston),"I Really Hate the way Women cheaters in films Lately All Seem to get away w/ adultery while there male partner is made to suffer the Consequences of His actions,Watch Unfaithful to see what I am talking about,Olivier Martinez is killed too !!! :( Lately there Seems to be this strange trend toward Forgiving the Vile B_tches for there Infidelitles...If it were my Wife She would be Dead and buried !!! Sorry Ladie's :)"
1,BOY!,"Is Jennifer Aniston dumb or what? in this movie someone says he was named after Catcher in the Rye (its a book) and she say ""Your name is catcher?"" When the guy ment the character in eh book Holden Cawfield!!! She is a total twit!! Must be why she and that other no-brainer Brad Pitt get along so well!Jennifer Aniston What an idiot!!!"
3,A serious character study sprinkled with some laughs,"Jennifer Aniston does a nice job inhabiting a bored woman who feels her life needs a desperate shake-up to keep her from going insane. The movie itself doesn't have anything brand new to say about such a situation, but it unspools the usual observations we're used to hearing about situations like this- mainly that an exciting, quick fix might not be the great remedy it initially appears to be- with subtlety and knowing humor. The DVD includes both a widescreen and fullscreen version of the film, plus a nice variety of extras."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Everyone I talked to who had seen this movie didn't like it very much, but I like Jennifer Aniston, and it was on cable so I decided to watch it. It's about a 30 year old woman who hates her life, her job, and her husband; she has a fling with a 22 year old she works with who hates his life even more than she does.This movie is mainly a drama, but it also has some funny parts. The characters are pretty believable, and one can relate to them, especially Justine (Aniston's character). I also like this movie because it is so different than what we are use to seeing Jennifer Aniston do. I enjoyed it."
3,Very weird,This story was really weird. I found it boring and depressing. I was expecting much better.
1,A different review,I bought this dvd after reading all the reviews on this site and on other sites saying that this is such a great movie. i watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies i had seen and could not believe that i had wasted so much money on it and so many people gave it such a good review. It was meant to be a comedy and i could not see anything that was close to commical in this movie. The most funny thing about this movie is how crap it was.
1,A MUSN'T See,"I can't believe Jennifer Aniston agreed to be in this movie - it was far from a comedy as the back of the DVD states. I guess ""Good Girl"" is a sarcastic title - and not only saying that it is far fetched that someone like her would be married into the lifestyle portrayed in the movie - but how could she really think of starting a life with Holden and not see that he is a complete wack job who has become obsessed with her.I really must admit that her acting was very good - but the movie was just terrible. It was simply unrealistic with her making ridiculous decisions - either she was desperate for money - desperate to be in a film - or just so out of touch with how ""little people"" live that she couldn't see that the movie was a bad choice. Just watch Friends and leave this one alone."
2,Very disappointing,"I rented this movie expecting a GOOD movie. I guess the acting was ok and everything, after all, it did raise emotions in me that I haven't felt towards a movie in a long time: Anger. It wasn't the actors fault I don't think. The movie flat out could have been better written. Instead I wound up so angry at just about every turn this movie took, and really disliking pretty much every character in this movie. The thing with Bubba was totally unnecessary and I think was the point I went from thinking this movie might make a possible recovery to just being a waste of my time and those people's talent."
4,Not your typical 'Friends' vehicle,"Jennifer Aniston's movie career hasn't amounted to a hill of beans, mostly due to her inability to pick good roles. Here though, whether through the luck of a blind squirrel finding an acorn now and then or better career management, she's honed in on a great anti-'Friends' tonic with Mike White's finely-tuned script. [White also appears as Aniston's bible study-going buddy.]The best thing to say about 'The Good Girl' is that it won't appeal to fans of Aniston's 'Rachel' persona. That's a 'go' signal for all of us fans of smaller, Independent Spirit-sized releases who would otherwise tend to lump an Aniston-led film into the category of ""Friends vehicle. Won't see."""
2,You probably have better ways to spend two hours.,"A lurking cynicism behind the portrayals of these characters, trapped as they are by their droll and inane lives, almost manifests itself here as comedy. The dubious choices these unsypathetic characters make in their lives result in very little emotional engagement for the audience. Mainly, I was wondering how this movie was made in the first place and why otherwise talented people would dedicate their time to completing it. There are only two good points (one for each star): 1) Aniston shows more of an acting range than expected in her portrayal, and 2) the characters and their situations are all but guaranteed to make everyone else feel better about their own lives, by comparison. I would only recommend this to a friend going through a serious funk in order to show them that as bad as their job, marriage, abuse problems, affairs, etc. might be..."
4,"She's not just a ""Friend"" anymore!","Aniston gives a terrific portrayal of the discarded wife. Aniston nails the character Justine who is employed at the local discount store and whose pot-smoking, house painter husband leaves something to be desired. I was reminded of a modern day cry of Betty Friedan. Justine doesn't realize that her destiny lies in her own hands and not in the hands of those around her. She seems in a state of emotional paralysis throughtout the film and my only gripe is that she would have found contentment along the way in herself. She needs a copy of the Feminine Mystique. Tragically moving and endearing you will be capitivated by Aniston's struggle with fidelity and emotional despondence. A must see!"
1,"depressing, boring and waste of good cast!",THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING MOVIES I'VE SEEN LATELY. A WASTE FOR JENNIFER ANISTON AND JOHN C REILLY. JAKE GUYLENHALL IS OVER-RATED (AGAIN). DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!!!!!THE WRITING/ SCRIPT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE ROUND FILE IN THE BEGINNING!!
1,"Can Jennifer Aniston really act? Not in this movie, anyway.","The beginning of this film gives you hope that it might turn out interesting and thought-provoking. However, it loses ground about half-way through. Jennifer Aniston proves once again that she is not a serious actress. She fails to engage us in her character, Justine. Even John C. Reilly (usually a very good character actor), who plays Justine's stoner husband, falls flat as he has little to work with. Jake Gyllenhal is alright as Holden, but they take that character too far out. The plot is thin and the filmaker leaves us with unanswered questions that seem rather pointless. The most entertaining parts of this film I found to be the dead-panned announcements over the PA in the discount store where Justine works."
1,Comedy?,"I was disappointed in the movie. It was billed ""A Comedy of Winning Delicacy and Heart"". There was nothing comical about it. I expected something more like Picture Perfect with Jennifer Aniston...that is a comedy. I lost interest in the middle of the movie. I watched it to the end but am sorry that I bought it."
2,Unlikeable Characters,"Jennifer Aniston certainly proves she can act in this film, playing the Anti-Rachel. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to like her character, or most of the others. She plays a selfish and amoral woman, who seems to care nothing about the feelings or well-being of others. Other unlikeable characters included her illicit lover, ""Holden"", a self-absorbed, whiney twit, who idolizes Salinger, but is himself a rather talentless writer, and Bubba, her husband's sleazy and opportunistic friend. In fact, the only character in the film who comes off at all sympathetic is her dim-witted but well-meaning husband, who seems to actually care about her for some reason. She should have gotten her husband into drug-treatment, and herself into night classes. Instead, she continues to lie to him right up to the end, apparently having learned nothing from her experience. Neither does the audience."
2,Self Pity Is A Waste Of Time,"What a waste of talent...Why is Hollywood so in love with losers?...The acting is top rate which makes this a very well constructed Outhouse!Outside of the talent, this story has one redeeming virtue, it shows the destructive effect Catcher In The Rye has had on our culture...Holden Caulfied is living in a free society, equipped with a healthy body and access to more education and advantages than can be dreamed of in 80% of the world..but the little spoiled brat is unhappy because the world is not perfect....and those who are addicted to Salinger's work are infected with this cowardly approach to life...What a waste of an hour and a half...There ARE happy, contributing, courageous human beings in the world and their stories are truly interesting...."
1,fine if you only need one....,I needed 2 valances to cover the double window in the nursery.. I went through 10 packages at the store and NON matched up in size... It was totally disapointing to realize I needed to get a valance that didnt match the set in order to have them be even. I even checked out the Fire Truck pattern and all 8 of them didnt match up as a set either.. for the money they should all be the same size!!!
4,awesome big label debut,"the ep may be short, but in no way is it lacking. great introduction to an artist that has been wowing and winning over audiences in the los angeles area for the past couple of years. the final track, monster, may be a tad overproduced in my opinion, but the rest is great. the opening track, your armor, is everything i had hoped it would be."
4,Want more Charlotte,Just picked up In Parentheses and now I can't wait to hear more of Charlotte's music. Can't wait to see her live. The Eastern grad is quite impressive. See you at the Gargoyle Lounge!
5,Marvelous,"I saw Charlotte at Howie Day's concert. I hadn't heard of her before and I have to admit I was surprised when she sat down at the keyboard without a band or anyone else to accompany her. I soon learned her voice itself definitely didn't anything else. Her words and voice were so powerful. I loved her performance! ""In Parentheses"" is a stellar album for first time Charlotte listeners. And she's incredibly down to earth. She hugged every single person that approached her after the preformance. She's just so warm, and you can definitely sense it through her music."
5,Exceptional,"Charlotte Martin's music paints a visual of a girl pouring her heart out over a piano- a visual that makes her music both enticing and emotional. You can't help but sing along to release your own personal conflicts, not in an angry way but in a poetic way. Charlotte's beautiful voice somehow maintains a quality of sweet innocence at the same time voicing strong conviction. All in all, her music is something special that deserves heavy rotation."
2,2E not wide enough,"I LOVE the style and look -- much better than almost any other boat shoe I've ever had. And the delivery was a day ahead of schedule. BUT...these shoes are NOT double-E width shoes. They seem to be about D width, so they are really too tight. Don't know what to do now: stretch 'em and hope they will be OK; or return them and keep looking. I am very sad about this, but I guess I should have taken to heart the reviews regarding the width of these shoes."
1,Shoes too small,I got the style I ordered but the shoes are too small! They are labeled 9 W but feel like a much smaller shoe. The reason I ordered this pair from Amazon was for the style of shoe and theSize. They are very hard to get on my feet and painful. Maybe if I keep trying to wear them for short periods at a time they will stretch out to my size.
4,My husband loves 'em.,I bought these to replace my husbands worn out boat shoes. He loves them. It is hard to find shoes in his size...
2,Smells like oranges.,"My husband cracked up when he saw that I had ordered this. He thought I was insane and that it would be pointless. I stood up for the veggie wash and argued its case.However, I have come to the conclusion that he was right. It doesn't seem a whole lot more effective than running the fruit/veggies under water for a little while. I'm not entirely convinced it does anything at all outside of smelling yummy."
3,Okay product--but not a miracle product,"Like many others, I want to make sure that fruits and vegetables end up being clean before feeding my family. For much of my life in the kitchen, I have cleaned the old-fashioned way, lots of water and lots of labor. I was pretty happy to hear about this product. And, indeed, it has been a net plus for our family.It does seem to speed up the process of cleaning. Nonetheless it is not a miracle product. Lots of old-fashioned work is needed for me--after using this product--to make me comfortable with preparinbg fruits and vegetables for consumption.So, a useful product, but not the be all and end all. Human inspection and fine tuning is still needed!"
4,Works fine!,Fruit seemed cleaner and the wax was washed off. I think water and soap would work fine but I wanted to try this stuff out. I only have to use a little bit at a time.
5,Ewwwwwwww!,"Length:: 0:51 MinsCheck out the brown,murky Veggie Wash runoff from these cherries and strawberries. I assure you that the Veggie Wash is not that color before spraying it on. As far as I can see, this is a very decent product. Check out my pics back on the main product page."
2,Get rid of the penguin,"Dropping in on Matisse is a fair watch for a short film, but 30 dollars???? There is way too much fluff in the lines (too much bantering about nothing), and I preferred the film to concentrate more on the works of Henri Matisse. Yet there are way way too many paintings missing from the film that weren't covered because of the fluffiness in the conversation between the cartoon characters of Matisse and the penguin. The best part of the film is the analysis of the few paintings by Matisse, but like I wrote...way too few of them covered. Another worst part of the film is how little of Matisse's history is covered. All in all, I was disappointed."
2,Not As Good As The Dropping In On Picasso or Rousseau,"Compared to other DVDs in the series, the animation in this is horrible, really amateur. At least SOME effort had gone into ""Dropping in on Picasso"" and ""Dropping in on Rousseau"" which felt much more like real real cartoons with characters and jokes, but this was a totally different with a much cheaper style of animation, and the transfer was crummy too. Whereas I had shown 15 minutes of the other DVDs in this series, I skipped ahead to the last five minutes of this one, just to show the ""drawing with scissors"" part, which was only a bit better than me showing the artwork and talking about it. Definitely not worth $30."
2,db link btn1,"ok connectors was to be a 0 ga,4ga and 2- 8 ga when it arrived it was a 2 ga not 0ga,the clamp bolt is cheap and shaves off metal when tightened. return cost was too high so it was a waste of money. buy the monster clamps, I did much better"
1,Does not fit on optima red top battery terminals,I bought this to replace my OEM terminal clamps. This one did not fit at all on the negative battery terminal of a an Optima red top. The clamp was way too big (like it was made for the positive terminal). I sent it back to amazon for a refund.
3,Not great for orthotics,"I purchased a pair of these after reading reviews praising their arch support, but had to return them. They were the correct size, but too narrow to accommodate my orthotics. If you don't need custom arch supports, these shoes would probably offer decent support for high, weak arches."
4,great shoe,"This is a stability plus shoe that is perfect for my foot type. I love this shoe, just wish it had more color options."
5,Great Product for a Great Price,Product arrived in a timely manner and is a great product for the price. Will definitely order from this company again.
5,Cones are simply awesome,"When you absolutely positively need to check the handling of your car, what better than a nice line of traffic cones formed into a decent 25-pace slalom course? When you need to wall off your fine automobile from a slightly over-adoring public, these cones provide BRIGHT ORANGE SAFETY and separation! Scared of Potholes with you 30-series rim-huggers? Plant a cone in that pesky road hazard and never worry again! Heck, pile up 10-15 of these in a stack, and you can incorporate an awesome upper-body workout while you place or recover your cones! These things are great!"
5,great songs,"I love Les Mis! This book has some truly beautiful songs. Some have even become favorites of mine, and I wouldn't have known about them otherwise!"
1,Same pat answers,"There is nothing revealing in his responses. He denies everything. What value is this? How is it interesting? It isnt . Unless you want to read (over and over )- ""I didnt do it"", ""I cant remember"" , ""I dont know"", ""I dont recall seeing that"", ""I dont remember saying that"". Read those quotes 200 times: there-now you have read the book."
2,Poor scholarship,"SampleAuthor writes ""the liberated self has achieved Self-knowledge and thus no longer recognizes any distinctions; yet he moves among us, performs the necessary activities of eating, drinking etc.,"" p 34This is careless and lazy writing. Author knows better than this. Lots of views and not a single reference to sources on this page. Not quite scholarly."
3,The Truth about the Dialogue!!,"I have a problem with some of the words used in this video. The trains tell each other to ""shut-up"", they call each other ""stupid"" and Diesel says he ""hates"" duck. That is the truth. Call me old-fashioned, but I find words like hate, stupid and shut-up to be inappropriate for a preschooler. I do not talk that way to my child or anyone else in my family and I do not expect him to talk that way to us. I considered taking the movie away from him but he does love it as much as he loves any of his Thomas movies. We sat down and watched it together and discussed the ""Ugly"" words and why he should not use them. He still watches the movie but has been taught that the ugly words are mean, hurtful and disrespectful. Not all the movies are like this one. Thomas has some great stories, this is just not one of the better ones. My suggestion is to pass on this one. There are so many better options."
5,"Great,Great tape","This is very good,along with A Big Day For Thomas.This & ABDFT has old stories from the old,discounted tapes(Tenders & Turntables,Thomas Breaks The Rules,and Better Late Than Never).Even though the old tapes had Ringo Starr on it,this is still good with George Carlin.The stories include:Thomas Comes To Breakfast(Vol.3)The Duck & Diesel Trilogy(Vol.5)Gordon Takes A Dip(Vol.5)Double Trouble(Vol.4)A Cow On The Line(Vol.4)Trouble In the Shed(Vol.3)All in all,this is an exellent tape,paired with A Big Day For Thomas,so if you want to see the old episodes,get this NOW.P.S If you want some Learning Curve Trains,buy the videos with the trains,and you save yourself some money =)"
4,My son loves this video & the bonus train,Great video! My son loves Thomas. This is the 6th DVD I bought for him. I thing this is a great deal. You pretty much buy the DVD and get the train for free. If I purchased the wooden train by itself it would have cost me the same with no DVD. Once I put this DVD on my son grabs his trains and plays with them while watching the DVD over and over and over...I get a lot done while he is occupied. By the way he is only 20 months old and he is learning his colors with Thomas as well as recognizing the numbers on the trains.
5,Eggs and Bacon please?,"^_^I just can't help but luv this video.Why?A few reasons-1.Its pretty similar to Better Late Than Never and other stories2.Ringo was great for his first 2 seasons,but Carlin rules all American narrators3.And third and most important of all...........Diesel-kun!^__________^Though it IS a complemation(Thomas Comes To Breakfast,Pop Goes The Diesel,Dirty Work,A Close Shave,Off The Rails and others),its still enjoyable to watch.^_^"
5,A Must Have For All Thomas Fans!,This is one of our all time favorites! The stories of Duck and Diesel are the best!
5,Amazing,"I just want to say what a WONDERFUL album this is. I feel somewhat privileged to be one of the first of my friends to listen and own this album. I have made all 14 of my closest friends buy this album. We ARE the Ashley Matte fan club, at least we like to think we are. There's nothing like finding great new talent before others do.I hope you make it far and I will continue to play your CD at EVERY dinner party I have for a very long time. I look forward to seeing you when you come to my town and waiting for the next CD. Bravo! Wonderful record. Every song! Thank you!"
1,In pretty rough shape,"The cover is very, very worn; the leather cover has horrible crinkling 1/2 to 1"" wide on front and back; pieces of red leather fall fall off very easily; corners are bent, etc. The listing should have included this information!"
3,"It's an okay helmet, but...","... for me, it sits too high and looks like a mushroom on my head. I'm sure it an okay helmet, just not for me."
4,Nice Looking and Fit,I just used my helmet and it seems to fit comfortably. It looks sharp just like you see on motorcycle cops. The only CONS is that the helmet strap once tied stays loose. Button to secure could enhance the experience. Otherwise seems fine and not to mention a fantastic price (it was a steal for me).
4,"Well padded, snug fit.",The padding is very thick so that the helmet sits a little high. The padding around the ear can be detached - a good option for the hot summer months.
3,helmet,"This helmet is pretty bulky and definitely gives the mushroom head appearance, but I feel like it fits really well and I definitely feel safe wearing it when I am on the roads."
4,raider helmet,"It's okay for the price. One of the outside visor snaps comes undone at the slightest push, but wearing it as a passenger on my husband's bike, the helmet is comfortable and less intrusive than a full face helmet.I should have gotten the medium, but I pulled the chin strap tightly and that helps. I will be buying a snap type closure to replace the D-rings."
3,Calling Spaceball One...,"Purchased based mostly on price, but other reviews led me to believe this was going to be a good buy. Arrived quickly, and on first glance it is a gorgeous helmet. Glossy and plenty of padding; the chinstrap cinches with a slip buckle in place of a clasp if that makes a difference to you. The built-in neck protection hidden in the zipper looked nifty. Felt sturdy and weighty. Certainly was not going to test it by having my kid take a crack at my noggin with a baseball bat.So why am I returning it? The large felt a little cramped; I had tried other helmets from various manufacturers and ""Large"" felt about right based on listed measurements. Got it out of the box and I looked like I had melon on my head. I looked like a prison guard from ""Spaceballs"" and that would not give me confidence to be seen in traffic.If I had a smaller head I'd probably love it, but with that in mind, it's going back."
1,Not Happy with my Purchase!,"Yea, The helmet looks alright and I read some of the reviews here on Amazon before I placed my order. The order came in promptly and the helmet was OK for the purchase price but the sizing chart on the manufacturers website is not accurate. My plan was to ship it back to Amazon and get a larger one but as I'm getting my shipment together I dropped the helmet and scratched it. Damn! Now I can't return it! If the sizing chart was correct I wouldn't have to complain.. But since it is not correct, I have a helmet that is too small and cant return it.. IM NOT HAPPY.. I just wasted my money!"
4,Does the job well!,"Works great. After about 6 months of use, the neck guard is beginning to rip, though I don't really care too much about that feature of the helmet. It's comfortable, though a little bit heavy. I like the matte color better than the shiny finish. It fits an average sized head well, though is too big for my small-headed (though very smart) wife, and might be too large for a big-headed individual (no matter how humble)."
3,nice helmet for the price,"The helmet is good for the price. Although it is mentioned that it comes with a removable visor, mine did not come with it."
3,Fragrance WAY TOO STRONG,"I gave this product 3 stars because the odor is overwhelming. The part they call fragrance actually makes me cough to use it. It does soften well, absorbs quickly, and isn't greasy. It is a bit tacky though, probably from the lanolin. I really hesitate using it having to prepare myself for the strong odor. I tried this Paquin Plus and the Aveeno Hand Cream, Intense Relief with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal 3.5 oz. The Aveeno lasts up to 24 hours (even through handwashing) and softens longer between applications. It does have a soft fragrance that's pleasant. It is more expensive, but I will purchase the Aveeno in the future as it's really a better product for problem dryness I have on my hands and feet."
4,Surprising!,"When I opened this book, I wasn't expecting to see a big cloth trunk inside--and neither was my 11-month-old son, who was instantly delighted.The illustrations in Mama Loves Me are nice--I'm partial to blue elephants, so I was bound to like these happy characters. The text tells about things that the mother and baby elephant do together. Although these activities (like playing with lemurs) aren't things that most children have experienced, many readers will be able to relate to the warmth of the parent/child relationship. The specificity the author uses in description of the elephants' activities makes the story more interesting.There isn't much of a plot to this book, but I don't know how much plot a person can expect of a board book. Mama Loves Me is a feel-good story with an interesting format."
1,Blah Blah Blah,"The Customer from Toronto on May 8, 2000 must have swallowed a dictionary. I can't understand one word this guy says - blah blah blah. Why do people think like that let alone write. Dazzle 'em with the B.S. and oh yeah - lets make mere wind sound solid."
3,another classic...,"Despite the historical flaws that historians may detect in this sort of ""epic history"", and despite the ideological criticism one may level at Spengler, who basically sees history as a continuous struggle between a Classical, static mind and a Faustian, dynamic spirit; this book is still fascinating and worthwhile to read. For one thing, it attempts analogies across disciplines and cultures, across times, and turns history into a lively presentation. Spengler's erudition is impressive, whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, and whatever the position one may take, it is still a work to contend with."
4,Beware of the colors,"I love this stoller. I have searched and searched for the right double stroller and a friend of mine got the red and grey one. I borrowed it and LOVED it!!!! I just ordered the black tango one so we wouldn't have the exact same one and the stitching is NEON orange!!!! It is black and gray but you can't see the bright orange from the picture, I don't like it at all and I am sending it back and getting the red one"
4,THE FUNKY DOLL,I REALLY LIKE THIS DOLL IT EVEN REMINDS ME OF MY SISTER BUT SHE ISN'T THE SAME SKIN COLOR
5,Dumpster Find....,This was my first dumpster dive. I found this book quite by accident. I threw it in the back seat and forgot about it until the weekend. I picked it up and started reading that Saturday. I stopped only to eat. There are some differences in the way the English language was respected back in the day...and this book is a good example. The word pictures were very clear. I had to read it all the way through...much to the chagrin of my wife.
2,Rossini: Il Barbiere di Siviglia [IMPORT],"If you just want to hear Florez, you are much better off buying the DVD-Barbiere di Siviglia (2005).Starring: Ruggero Raimondi, María Bayo Director: Ángel Luis Ramírez. At least the sound quality is better, Florez is in excellent form and the DVD is far cheaper.The CD album :Rossini: Il Barbiere di Siviglia [Import] ~ Gioachino Rossini (Composer), Ralf Weikert (Conductor), Munich Radio Orchestra (Orchestra), Edita Gruberová (Vocals), Eric Serra (Vocals), et al.,is far too pricy for such an awful recording.Unless you are a diehard fan of Florez and want to add to your collection, don't bother! It is a total waste of money as far as I am concern."
4,Really great Easter illustration!,"This was a wonderful book for my four kids! I thought that it was age appropriate (they are all under 7), and I loved that it was a board book. While we read it, the babies couldn't rip it up!I liked it because it does not cast normal Easter activities in a bad light (i.e. Easter Eggs, Easter bunny, etc), but puts them in context. In this book secular celebrations do have a place, but they do not replace the religious context! I thought it was a great message for little ones! I would highly recommend this book!"
3,Did not see the concept as age appropriate,"I purchased this book for my 4-mos old grandson's Easter basket as it was described as a wonderful way to explain the various experiences of Easter--jelly beans, Easter bunny, chocolates, and the resurrection of Jesus. The book was published for children 0 to 2 years old and has thick shiny cardboard pages, simple bright pictures, rhyming, and a few words on each page. My disappointment is the book's story is ""too deep"" for a baby or toddler as the story speaks to the ""death"" of Jesus stating that he died and was dead for three days. Books for children this age should have simple concepts. Death in general and the story of death and resurrection of Jesus can be very difficult topics to broach with little children. I will donate the book to the local library for their annual sale. I did find another book more age appropriate, ""The Easter Bunny's Amazing Day"" which was a wonderful story of the Easter bunny and the resurrection of Jesus."
3,Very useful booklet; CD is also pretty good.,"The booklet that comes with this CD is very usefull for setting up your Dolby Pro Logic surround sound system, and the music on the CD is excelently recorded. The sound effects leave a little to be desired though. But then, I'm a guy and would really like to find a CD with some Jets and explosions."
4,IMITATION OF LIFE,"MAKES YOU CRY,WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO WATCH IT. SHOULD ALWAYS RESPECT AND BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE NO MATTER WHAT, YOU MAY FEEL ABOUT WHERE YOU COME FROM."
5,Imitation of LIfe DVD,I love old movies and I love this story. This DVD contained both versions of the movie. They are both excellent.
5,Excellent!,"The movies are so wonderful. I know there are alot of reviews about the movies themselves so I won't go in to that. The packaging and products were new and in excellent condition. I was surpized to see this at a local mall video store for less than half the price I got it for here. Wouldn't matter, I never would have expected to find it locally and brand new at that so glad I got it when I did."
3,Bootleg copy?,This movie came to me with parts blacked out. The clarity was not clear. Perhaps it was a bootlegged copy.
4,A timeless classic for generations to come,Purchased for my mom because I know she likes this movie. Another classic to add to collection and at the time of purchase no one else had it in stock.
5,A Masterpiece of how Society lived in the 30's,"This was something I remember my mom loved to watch; it brought back good memories of her and what we enjoyed together. I actually like the one with Claudette Colbert the best; probably be cause it was the original, but Lana Turner did a fine job as well. You feel so much compassion for her mother when the daughter tries to hide her true heritage and when it was too late she realize she was so cruel to her mom; but then it was too late to say anything because mom was gone. The story is riveting and keeps you interested but be prepared to pull out the handkerchiefs...it's a tear jerker!!!"
5,A story to be admired,"I adore these classics. They are the best! This is a movie everyone should see. Outstanding! Fabulous, undeniably incomparable, the best!"
5,Awesome,This movie surpassed all of my expectations. The color was extraordinary and the movie itself was excellent. I so enjoyed the movie.
5,Outstanding Cd,"Great Metal band from Finland with excellent vocals. This is the 2nd album for the group and was much better then the first album Primal Exhale which had some great songs, but didn't have what Waterlines brought out. Waterlines as a whole is a great album, but if you like epic songs listen to Soaking Ground. The first 3 tracks are also great. Buy this cd if you love good metal especially progressive/power metal. It's a must have."
4,Very solid power metal.,"This CD struck a very good chord with me, mainly due to the vocals which I characterize as 'clear but with character'. The singer, Jarmo Pääkkönen, has a rich, almost mellow singing voice but can add a bit of grit and emotion when the songs crank up a notch. The best example of this can be found on ""Losing Time"" which starts quiet and then kicks it into a higher gear (especially at the 2:55 or so mark when Pääkkönen really lets loose). Every once in awhile his voice seems to hit a note just slightly off, but I consider him one of my favorite singers in metal.The music is generally pretty straightforward with some nice melodies. The earlier songs are faster, heavier and a bit more memorable. The later songs tend to blur together and feel a bit more generic, but it's still quality music. It works particularly well in a mix of different styles of metal since then the 'sameness' of some of the songs is less noticeable."
3,Very small with short handles,"These spatulas are really cute and well made, but the handles are too short - so it's my mistake ordering them. They're only good for reaching into shallow and small containers."
5,Adore these!,"These are perfect for getting into small jars i.e. peanut butter jars, etc, to get all the scrapings out and the little spatula ends come off to make for an easier wash...Not to mention they are just adorable! So glad I got these and can't wait to get the whisk!"
3,Sibling Competition and its complicated triangles,"Mickey and Francis are brothers in constant rivalry. Mickey drives a cab while Francis works on Wall Street and is married to his college sweetheart. When Mickey picks up passenger Hope he impulsively marries her within 24 hours and moves into her bohemian apartment in New York. Francis begins an affair with Heather, his brother's ex-fiancee who has a questionable past. The brothers get into a lot of squabbling and lose the women in their lives. Almost."
4,French Kiss/She's the One,"5 Stars for the great feel-good romantic comedy, French Kiss. 3 Stars for She's the One. I don't know whether it's my DVD player or this particular version, but the spoken words don't go with the mouth movements, which was very distracting."
3,Not a bad rainy afternoon rental,"I just rewatched this recently after seeing it when it first came out. Some of the acting is downright bad, and Jennifer Aniston (who gives one of the better performances) plays the same character she always plays, but it's an interesting story, and great soundtrack."
1,Amazon's Video on Demand WEBSITE SUCKS,"This was listed as a combo of ""French Kiss"" which we wanted to see ""Video On Demand"" WITH ""She's The One.""But when I selected to rent it, it was ONLY ""She's The One."" What lame, deceptive, and/or totally screwed up / sloppywebsite stuff. Is it worth fighting with Amazon to get my $2.99 back? Hardly, unless my time is worth $.10 an hour. UGH.Amazon, get your act together. How many ""accidentally confusing"" screwed up dual-listings does Amazon have which makes them money for ripping people off? Another UGH."
3,"Very enjoyable, funny movie","I bought this movie because of the Tom Petty sound track, but i enjoyed it overall for the entertaining story, quirky characters and often hilarious dialogue. The romantic story was not terribly deep, but sweet anyway. It was worth watching for the laughs, and it did offer an intriguing take on brotherly rivalry. Also, TP's songs did not disappoint. Though this movie IS about 16 years old now, it does not seem dated except for the views of the pre-9/11 skyline."
4,"Clever and cute, but not a typical romance comedy","A cleverly written web of a plot and complex characters, some likable and some not, all with real issues make this movie a lot more interesting than the typical romance comedy, a genre I don't usually go for. If you like your romance comedies a bit different, you'll enjoy this one."
2,I wouldn't want to know these people,"Two relentlessly sarcastic brothers reach an unpleasant but revealing turning point in their relationship after the elder brother marries a woman he has known only a few hours. The younger brother, driven by greed and competitiveness, neglects his own marriage for a one-upmanship involvement with the elder brother's faithless ex-fiancee. Their father shows his affection for them by impugning their masculinity. Their mother is never home. The inlaws openly discuss everyone's sex life."
3,Breezy romantic comedy.,"She's The One is a good romantic comedy but some of the characters lack depth and substance. Jennifer Aniston proves she's more than a pretty face, her acting is superb. Cameron Diaz is surprisely entertaining here, she can carry a film as well. I like the messy relationships and dynamics but this movie is slightly forgettable."
3,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",A LOVE TRIANGLE BETWEEN TWO BROTHERS AND ONE GIRL. ONE BROTHER IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THE OTHER BROTHERS EX-WIFE. WHERE THEIR ARE STILL FEELING INVOLVED WITH THE FIRST COUPLE. ONE BROTHER IS A TAXI DRIVER AND THE OTHER IS A LAWYER WITH MONEY. WHO WOULD YOU PICK? JM
3,No Oscar Nominations,"Well if your significant other makes you watch this relationship film remember that at least Cameron Diaz looks beautiful; Jennifer Aniston looks beautiful; the brother's father John Mahoney was also TV sitcom's Frazier's dad, but this time without the limp. Otherwise, no Oscar nominations for this two -hours- to- kill on a Saturday night, no- where- to- go, no -one -around, bargain bin DVD. Three stars are a reach, but I wanted to be sensitive; after all, this is a film about relationships."
3,Forget She's The One...,"..and just buy ""French Kiss"". I'll watch just about anything, but I couldn't make it through ""She's The One""."
1,I have not received this purchase yet???,"Aloha, I have purchased this Item FRENCH KISS/SHE'S THE ONE on 7/17/09 and have not yet received it. Please advise on date of delivery. Many Thanks Ethel Gills 808-699-5113"
1,Blech!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I thought this would be really good because it stars Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, both of whom I really like. I was wrong. This movie is worse than a really bad soap opera. Both of these actresses have appeared in some abysmal movies, but this one takes the cake. There is rock bottom, but in this case you have rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, and then 'She's the One'! The only way the movie could be worse would be if Pauly Shore was a co-star (that's my husband's opinion)!"
1,Borrrrring,"It's hard to tell if this movie is so boring because of the plodding script or the wooden directing, since the same guy is guilty of both. It certainly isn't funny, either. Cameron Diaz does a good job as the hooker who prefers old guys with money (surprise!), but the rest of the actors look trapped. Hopefully this will be the last time Ed Burns gets to make a movie."
1,Boring! Took 1.5 hours for a 45 minute story - poor plot.,"Not enough interest to hold my attention. Jennifer Aniston is one of my most favorite actresses and I try not to ever miss her. However, one of her greatest and most positive attributes and assets is her beautiful legs - they are the best in Hollywood! In this movie, there was not even one view of them. She wore slacks or to the floor dresses the whole movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys looking at Jennifer and is facinated by her, such as in Picture Perfect. No comparison. See Picture Perfect!"
1,oh peelllllleaaase!,a gorgeous young woman gets into a thirty-something loser cab driver's cab and a day later marries him. Huh? Can't he come up with something better than THAT? It seems like a high school masturbation fantasy.
1,Never Played,"I bought this for a friend as a Christmas gift, was very disappointed to find that it would not play on any DVD player (4 different ones tried). When I returned it I did not get a full refund because it was not from Amazon but from another company through Amazon. Buyer beware! I almost never buy from other vendors because the return policies are not as good as Amazon's, be sure to read the policies from vendors other than Amazon. BTY Amazon is still my favorite retailer!"
5,Amazing Book!,"While reading ""Cages"" in the 7th grade, everything about Kit reminded me of my lifestyle. I had a dad that drunk alot, I always had problems in school - and this book actually helped me get through it all. Reading about Kit and how she chose to solve her problems helped. Her honesty and courage made her an excellent role model for me! Although she's just a character in a book, I really admired her.The book itself was completely amazing. I usually dont get into that many books...I'm not much of a reader. But when I read Cages - I literally got hooked on the very first page. It was a well-written book that I really got into. After I finished it, I bought it and still read it often.I think anyone who loves animals, has troubles lit Kit, or just needs a good book - should buy this book right away. I promise you'll get into it and love it...it's worth all the money you pay. ^___^"
5,"Kit learned how to free herself from her ""cage"".","This story is about a girl named Kit who got caught shoplifting. This happened all because of her many problems at home and at school. Kit was sent to do community work at the Humane Society and she made friends with a dog named Lady. She decided to find a home for the dog but it was too late as the dog was soon put to sleep. From here, Kit learned that she had to free herself from her cage which required a lot of courage."
5,Definately one of my favorites,"Even though the author is my aunt I think this is one of the best books she has ever written. It relates well to the struggles of everyday teenagers. My aunt is defiantely in love with animals and helping them. In this book she shows that through kit. If you're ever having a rough time in your life I suggest reading this book. It really helps you to realise that we all have ""cages"" that we need to free ourself from."
2,Cages was absolutely dreadful,Cages is a boring book about a girl named Kit. Kit is fed up with her mother and her stupid drunken stepfather. Kit runs away from the house after a fight with her stepfather and goes to the local mall. She is shaken up and she decided to steal a golden bracelet. But she gets caught and is sentenced to 20 hours of community service.I would not recommend this book to anyone besides people that like boring books. I just didn't think it was interesting at all. It was filled with too much drama.I didn't like this book because it is boring and just not interesting. Kit whines too much in the story. I think it would be better if she would go on a giant killing spree or something!I gave these book 2 stars out of 5 stars because it wasn't interesting to me. I would be a good book if you are into reading about drama.By: DR. EVIL
3,cages,"Thi book is about a girl named Kit Hathaway Who most of the time argues with her stepdad Wayne. One day Kit stole a gold bracelet, and got caught. She then had to work at the humane society, and if she didn't get in any more trouble with the police for two years, it would be dropped off of her pernamet reacord. While doing her time at the humane society, Kit got attached to a dog named Lady. Later in the book, kit has to find someone who would adopt Lady. Someone Kit knew, Marcia, wants to adopt lady. When they meet at the humane society, Kit finds out that Lady had been euthaized. Marcia the decieds to adpot a different dog."
2,~*!!My Cages review!!*~,"In the book cages, Kit steals a bracelet from Pierre's because of problems with her step father and because she didn't get the part she wanted in the school play. Then Kit has to do twenty hours of community service work at the Humane Society to get it taken off her perminate record, but she doesn't mind the work because she knows how it feels to be trapped in a cage! After a while Kit seems to find the key to her cage!I thought Cages was an OK book but I didn't like it very well and I thought it was a little too predictable. I would mostly recommend this book to any girl in grades 4 and up."
3,Cages,"This story is about a young girl named Kit Hathaway. Kit is faced with many challenges and ends up with one big feat. For example, one of her battles is going to a Juvenile Court Committee for stealing a golden bracelet from a store in the mall. The committee sentences Kit to twenty hours of community service at a local animal adoption center. Kit finds a way to break free of her ""cage"" and is whole lot happier.I thought this was a good book for many reasons. First of all, some of the character descriptions were really good. I also liked the moral of the story, but I'm not going to let you in on it until you read the book.I would recommend this book for those whom have younger siblings. They might want to read this to them for a weekly activity.I give this book three stars for the moral, and the descriptions. Read this book and you decide what to give it."
1,Cages,I did not like this book at all because it was very dumb and stupid and ignorent and i really just didnt like it at all. I would definately reccomend this book to a person who likes stupid books beacause this on is one.
4,Cages,A good book that I read is called Cages. A person who likes dogs should read this boook. The book is about a girl named Kit. She has a friend named Tracy. She wanted Kit to come to her party but Kit got in trouble. Then she has to go and volenteer at the shelter. This book will teachyou what to do and what not to do. Some parts of this book are funny and some parts are sad. At the end of some chapters there is a suspense. That is why I think you should read this book.
3,Cages,"kit hathaway loses her lead in the school play. she has problems with her stepfather. kit steals a gold braclet worth $300 at a fancy department store. she gets caught and has to do 20 hours of community service at the shelter. suddenly her whole life changes. kit is sure she's blown her chance at a scholarship, and even her relationship with her best friend (TRACY)strained. ironically, the only good thing is her sentance. kit feels just like those animals...caged in.i think the book was ok because it was kinda boring. i think this is a fifth grade book. i would recammend this to an age group og 9-11."
5,unlock your cage today,"This is a GRRRREEEEAAATTT book!! It has a good point where we as people can get trapped daily, & sometimes we dont try to unlock our cage. Kit Hathaway is like a lot of young teenagers who get upset when there parents drink or do drugs or whatever. I think when they added Lady to the story it made it even better. It showed how you can attach to a thing & then all the sudden it can be taken away. In the end when Dorathy got sick & wayne & kit made up but then wayne got drunk the next day. This book will make you cry if you have a heart"
2,If you have an SHO- not in this book,If you have an SHO- Don't buy this thinking it will help you. I have not found one word in this book that refers to the 3.0 or 3.2 engines that are in the SHO models. I'm still struggling to find a book that does. It's kind of hard to find someone to work on my sho without taking it to the Ford stealership (almost worse than harley). I would sure like to do most of the work myself but the most help this book has given me was something to set my tools on while changing the oil.
1,95Ford Chilton Manual,"The 95 Ford Taurus Chilton car manual that I ordered was not worth it. I thought it was in descent condition. But it was old, had water damage, and tons of scracthes on the front cover. I did get a refund though."
4,better then the rest!,Chilton beats Haynes for more in-depth details. The only thing haynes manuals are good for is TP!
2,Poor Wiring diagrams,"There is a difference between an electrical schematic and a wiring diagram. This manual provides neither. A schematic shows the electrical components and wire numbers (or colors) via national electrical code symbols. I realize that the manual does not claim to show a schematic. But it does claim to show wiring diagrams. The diagrams are not shown relative to electrical standards. Not by a long shot. They are simple block diagrams. Not only are they useless because they don't show sufficient detail, the lines and printing is so faint that you can't even read what is supposed to be showing."
5,"sturdy dubba, decent spices","A fine masala dubba: sturdy construction, decent size(small enough to fit on a shelf), and has an inner cover. This is my first dubba, so I can't confirm the ""Superior Quality"", but it does what I need it to do and I don't imagine any reason you might be disappointed with it. I've heard that some cheaper ones arrive dented or the lids are warped, so maybe the superior quality is in the slightly thicker metal."
3,Helpful to a tax LLM student,"I started on earning a tax llm this semester. Having never taken a tax class in law school, I went out and bought a number of study aids. This one helps, however its not my favorite tax law study aid. Perhaps, it is better suited for people with at least some tax/tax law exposure. Biggest issue: no problems, and even worse no answers to those problems!!! I recommend, but only if purchased in conjunction with other aids. Hope this review helps someone out there."
2,Well-Written and Surprisingly Interesting; Very Poor Study Aid,"I think this would be a good book to have if you needed to write a paper/article about income tax law or need an academic primer. It is well-written and more engaging than I expected. I did not, however, find it useful for learning actual tax law for my income class tax. It reads more as a free-flowing discourse about tax law than as a treatise or concise explanation of important topics. The organization seems to be based on rhetorical preference rather than any kind of logical order, so I found myself scrutinizing the index for everything.So I guess I can recommend this book if you are deeply interested in the how and the why of tax law. If you just want to get an A on your exam, look elsewhere. I found this book almost useless come crunch time."
3,Just okay,This book did not meet my expectations. It was well-written but had little practical application to the course that I was in. I found other supplements to be much better. This was just not detailed enough.
4,Plays,Sometimes it is hard to get certain plays and I have been looking for Marisol everywhere. I was under the impression that there were six plays in this book so I actually got the wrong play book but that is okay because I did get Marisol. It is in good condition and I am happy with it.
5,Darren Rice,"It was really unfortunate this band came to the fore 5 years too late.I went to school with Darren rice and am still a freind. Funny thing is he is setting up a stat and a telecaster for me tomorrow. He has a music store on the fylde coast and still regularly plays on stage. Last time i saw him play was at the Fleetwood festival. He is a genius with the guitar and no wonder, i remember him playing an acoustic on stage in assembly when we were 5 years old!Any way, this album is just as superb now as it was in 1991. I recommend it fully. He'll have to buy me a drink now ha ha."
1,Parabens suck!,I was disappointed that a product that touts itself as natural contains parabens that are cancer causing.
3,The Austere Academy,I think that this is a great book but it could be a little bit more happier. I know that this book is in a series of unfortunate events but even unhappy books can be a little bit happy. But I think it is a great book FOR A RAINY COLD GREY DAY!
3,Michael Richview Middle,"This book mainly involves three orphans called the Bauldinlares. TheBauldinlares are Violet, Klaus, Sunny. Count Olaf was the first person to get the orphans, but the orphans outsmarted him and escaped. After he got of jail he went after the Bauldinlare's fortune. He would disguise himself as a diffrent person and sneak into thier house nd kill ther guardians, but the orphans always seemed to escape. They were always fortunate to be alive. They were at the Austere Academy when thier new gym coach showed up. his name as Coach genghis, which actually count olaf. The orpahns knew right away who it was. They tried to aviod him as often as the could. The night of the concert, the orphans were out int the yard when Coach Genghis shoused up. The orphans ran and all he got was thier notebook. So, the orphams escaped again from vount olaf."
1,Stop reading this series now!,"That's it! I'm done reading this series to my Fifth Grade class. Teaching in a school that has over 50% free or reduced meals, the last thing my charges need to hear are the unfortunate events of some kids who will be wealthy sometime in the ""future"". When will the future happen? Is the author going to write these inane and improbable stories forever without any end in sight? In what year (real time) will Violet become of age? I don't know. If the author would let us know when these unfortunate events are going to end, then maybe my students and I will hang in there. Without a timeline, we're outta here."
1,terrible shouldnt be published!!!,this book is very disapointing in that u cant read one book you have to read every book in the series so that it makes senseand constantly the author explains his words as if no one knows what lucky means?????geeeeeznot good i am disapointedand i have to write a novel study ont this book bah
4,Pretty Good,This book was actually very good after the 4th book.... I thought that Mr. Snicket was very clever with his use of details in SORE and the Quagmire triplets. He also mentioned V.F.D. What is it? I think it means Very Fine Disguise
5,A Series of Unfortunate Events # 5 is a great book.,"This great book has a little of everything in it. It has sadness, intelligence, comedy, and much more. This book was incredibly descriptive. It also had unusual words that people rarely use and it tells you the difference. This book helps you learn and at the same time entertains you.First the amazingly unfortunate orphans (the Baudelairs) are moved from their previous and ruined home and moved from house to house until now. Now they are in a boarding school and the children are still afraid that their first guardian is going to hunt them down as usual to steal their huge fortune. Thankfully the Baudelairs as usual manage to ruin Olaf's plot and keep their fortune. In this book however Olaf didn't run by himself and some accomplices. This time he took the Quagmire triplets who had a fortune of their own and they were not only friends of the orphans, they were orphans as well."
4,"I thought this was really good, i liked the suspense.","Coming from a 17 year old,I thought this book was really good. It was suspenseful with a little change in plot because the Baudelaires didn't try to expose Count Olaf right away. They also get friends which I thought was good, and added to the suspense by the end of the book. I was reading one review, and it stated that more than one person could be writing these books, and not just one person with a pen name. I think that is an interesting theory because books 1-3 have the exact same plot, but the plot begins to change in book 4, and continues to change in book 5, so maybe there is more than one writer. I thought that was interesting, and could be a possiblity.<3Loran"
5,The Best Book,"Wow! This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It was so good I just couldn't put it down. Well anyway... Mr.Poe sends Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to a horrible boarding school. Right off the bat it gets horrible, but the Bauldalaires made some friends. But that didn't stop them from their problems. You know that Count Olaf has to come in some how. But I don't want to give it away. If you haven't read this book already then please do so. Come read this book to hear a shocking ending and for an interesting book to read."
5,Cody's review,"I liked the book The Austere Academy by Lemony Snicket. I'm not the greatest reader but Ididn't get lost and there was always something exciting going on. I liked this book the best out of al of them. The reason I liked this book the most is because they where always doing something bad. The end of the story left you wondering so you wanted to read the next book.The story was about Sunny, Klaus, and Violet going to a prep school and getting bad grades. Now Coach Genhis is really Count Olaf who is trying to steal the orphans, fortune that their parents left when they died in a fire. Then they meet the Quagmires and become friends. The Quagmires get kidnapped by Count Olaf and all three go after them but they couldn't get them. Then Sunny, Klaus, and Violet get expelled from their school.The type of reader would like this book is people who like exciting books. The age group that I think would like this book is like 10-13 years old. That's what I think about this book."
4,a remarkable review,"This is one of my favorites of the series. The hapless Baudelaire orphans are sent to a most unusual boarding school, run by Vice Principal Nero, who true to his name, is a horrible fiddler. As usual, the surroundings (a crab infested shack in lieu of a dorm) are miserable, and so are the people they meet, including the obnoxious Carmelita Spats (the prettiest girl in school) and Coach Genghis, who is Count Olaf in disguise and a truly noxious gym teacher.One bright spot: The orphans meet the Quagmires, another brother and sister who lost their parents similiarly, and show signs of being allies in future books. With their help, they manage to thwart Count Olaf's scheming, at least until the next book."
5,A Series of Unfortunate Events Book,"This book is wonderful. I bought it for my daughter in hopes she would read over the Christmas holiday. She did and loved it! It was ordered, shipped and received within 5 days. I would recommend Amazon to anyone. As far as this book, the whole series is wonderful."
4,Good but not the best in the series,"I thought that this was a good book, but it was not the best in the series, it had a lot of supensful parts in it but over all it would be one of those books you read twice and then never touch again."
3,Austere Academy is Alright,The Series of Unfortunate Events all have a dark theme and Austere Academy is no different. The author uses humor to lighten the mood but some children might find the general tone of the book hopeless. If you child is looking for a silver lining or a happy ending this may not be the book to get.
2,HUGE hole in book,"This book is the biggest in the series to recieve the Lemony Snicket formula. The formula? 1. Put the children in a hapless situation. 2. Throw in a couple of really really mean adults. 3. Give them friends that disappear by the end of the book.4. Finally, make the really mean adults restrict just about everything they want to do.Lemony Snicket writes based on situation and not much else. Boo!"
3,Book review on a series of unfortunate events num.5 The Austere Academy by: Blake Hunton,"The Baudelaires are going to school in this fifth instalment of the Series of Unfortunate event novels. This adventure includes noisy shoes,angry crabs,kidnapping,and other unfortunate events like the evil character count Olaf. The Baudilaires are pusheded around and call names by a character named Camilia Spatts and laughed at by most of the other kids at this school. Everthing seems glum for the Baudelaires till they meet the quagmire triplets Duncan and Isadora who also lost their parents in a fire, but onlike the Baudelaires they lost their triplet Quigley who died in a fire. Later on in the book they get a new P.E. teacher who makes them do strange S.O.R.E. programs,to find out what these programs are and what happens read A Series Of Unfortunate Events,Book 5 The Austere Academy."
4,Interesting!,"The novel of a series of unfortunate events is about three orphans going through painful experiences, having an enemy frequently returning into their lives, trying to get his hands on their big fortune. In the fifth installment of this series, the orphans go into a boarding school, in which there are unfair rules and unfair treatments. But as usual evil Count Olaf comes back to torture them. Finally in this installment they actually find friends who can help them. But as usual there are always unfortunate events. It is a great novel to be read by 10-15 year old students. I felt sorry for the way the orphans were treated. But I'm hoping to read the rest of the series, just because of how interesting the novel is. I rate this book a B+, and 4 stars."
5,Book the 5th,"If you have read any of the other books you probably know what it is like. I have read books 1-4 and Book the 5th is as good as or better then the others. They meet new friends, make a new enemy and once again run into Count Olaf, this time as a Gym Teacher. I recommend you read this book with EXTREME CAUTION because your sides might split with laughter, you might drown in your own tears, your head might blow up in suspense, or all of the above."
5,What is a cakesniffer?,"Well, I've read the series up to this book so far, and I had to get right online to write this review. Finally, after four other books, Snicket introduces some more characters that are the Baudelaire's age. This widely expands the series. This book also makes us wonder a lot more about ""Count Olaf"" and gives you the inkling that he may have had a lot more to do with the Baudelaire's problems..."
4,unpleasant,"If you are going to read this book it is not going to be a happy ending type of story. This book was not the greatest book that I have read about the Baudelaire's but it was ok. They go to this school and they have to run S.O.R.E. during Vice Principle Nero's violin recitals. In all of these books Count Olaf their first guardian tracks them down at all of their new homes, in disguise."
4,The Austere Academy Review,I thought that this book was a very good. I liked this book because i thought that it was interesting. I also liked this book becuase i thought that it had a good plot.
4,Meet The Quagmire Triplets!!!,"In the 5th book of the series the Baudelaires go to a boarding school called,""Prufock Elementary"" where they meet Vice Principal Nero. Nero thinks he is the best violin player in the world(but he really can't play worth beans.) There they meet the Quagmire triplets Duncan and Isadora( their brother and parents died in a fire,)and become immediate friends."
5,Wow! How Good Do These Books Get,"Violet, Claus, and Sunny go to a bording school where they find nothing but trouble... and two friends! The principal makes them listen to 6 hours of his so-called ""violin playing."" They make two good friends called the Quagmire triplets who lost their mom, dad, and brother in a fire. As you might have guessed, Count Olaf shows up with the sneakiest plan yet! I highly recommend this book."
4,Four Stars,"This is the fifth book of a new series about the unfortunate kids that go to this private shcool for safty but what they don't know is that there new gym teacher just might be the person there trying to get away from.Read tis book by Lemony Snicket about Violet,Klause,and Sunny and how unfortunate there lives are.I thought this book was creative,suspenseful,and thrilling.The whole series is great.I would recommend tihs book to anyone who likes sad stories."
5,The Big Bad Wolf and school in one. Uh Oh!!,"The Austere Academy Lemony Snicket Scholastic 2001This is a sad (but funny) tale of the Baudelaire orphans as they go to boarding school. They find that the villain Count Olaf has found them again, this time disguised as Coach Genghis. Unfortunately,Genghis gets away with the two Quagmire triplets who were the Baudelaires best friends.At the end of the book, just as the Baudelaire orphans think that Count Olaf's identity will be revealed Olaf says "" I'm afraid I cannot take off my running shoes...I need them."" With that, he runs away to a car which his assistants have waiting for him. The Baudelaires are startled for a moment then start running after him. They see that Olaf is kidnapping the two triplets, Isadora and Duncan Quagmire.Violet and Sunny Baudelaire remove Olaf's disguise and their brother Klause tries to save Isadora.

5,Works fine,"This machine has heft to it. Had the box not said so, I would not have known it was remanufactured. Use it exclusively for crushing ice for smoothies. Made 35 or 40 and so far, so good. Burned out another more expensive brand in no time flat. Better to stop and pulse again at the first sign slowing down (which it rarely does but after reading reviews of other machines and how common burn outs are I'm taking it slow...which means maybe 60 seconds more to make a smoothie).Instinctly, I almost bought the five speed which is five bucks more and then thought, ""Why? I'll never need two more speeds, the simplier a machine is, the better""."
5,KitchenAid remanufactured Ultra power 3-Speed Blender,Purchased the Blender two months ago. A great heavy duty blender. Would recomend it to everyone. Love the glass container. Can store it in the fridge. I have even used it to grind some raw steak for hamburgers. KitchenAid stands up to it's name.
4,A Brilliant Overview,"I finished this wonderful book last night knowing that I would have to re-read it very soon. There is simply too much to absorb at one reading.Twelve hours after putting the book down, I saw a headline in the Guardian (a UK daily), ""US to send troops to Georgia"". Before reading ""Eastward to Tartary"", this headline would have meant nothing. But now....."
4,"not as great as ""balkan ghosts"" but what could be?","Robert Kaplan's has written another educational and interesting book about areas of the world that are just about to emerge as news stories. This book is not as great as ""Balkan Ghosts,"" but what is? That book was a classic, and is undoubtedly the most influencial book written on the Balkans in our lifetime.""East to Tartary"" told me a lot about countries I knew a little about (Turkey, Israel, Armenia) and opend a new world about several countries that fascinating and sure to be important within the next decade--the countries east of the Caspian Sea, which are rich in oil and natural gas. Mr. Kaplan travels as a regular traveler would--on steamships, buses and trains crowded with ordinary citizens of Eastern European and Central Asian countries.This book is highly recommended. Am I going to have to wait another three years for the next Kaplan report on the world.David W. Lee Edmond, OK leelawok@mmcable.com"
4,Must have for Military Officers' Reading List,"This book should be on every Military Officer's reading list. It explores the history and culture of the Balkans, Near East and Midddle East in a way that explains the roots of today's hotspots in the world. If you want to gain some understanding of why these countries are constantly on the minds of U.S. and European Leaders, you need to read this book."
4,Informative Read,A good look at a historically complex area at the juncture of east and west. A peek at the political and cultural mixture of an area not generally known.
4,Nice product but...,"Make sure that you are following the instructions for this product. The description notes that you can use these on your wrists for walking, so take note that you basically cannot use them on your wrists for anything but that. They are adjustable, so they will probably fit your wrists, but they are too big to do anything like punching or high impact exercise without them slipping all over the place. So you can use them on your wrists for walking, but nothing else. They fit my ankles fine, but when I've done kickboxing or other high impact exercise, sometimes it feels like they might come off. I think these are great for low-impact exercise, but you might want to go with something else for high-impact."
3,Designed for teens and small people.,"I have a wrist that is 7"" around. The edges of this product just touch as I try to wrap it around my wrist and I can't attach or use it. Be sure your wrist is only 6"" or so before buying. Appears sturdily made and I plan to keep and try to adapt with elastic straps in order to use."
1,way too small for a small woman's wrist,"These are tiny--way too small for my wrists. I'm a small woman at 4""11' and 115 lbs. If they don't fit me, they won't fit anybody. Maybe 0 starts would be a better choice."
3,Tires out after a few tracks,"""Dark Salvation"" and ""Monsters"" are unbelievably great songs. After hearing those two, I thought that this would instantly become one of my all time favorite albums, but sadly, the album kind of falls apart after that. Not all the rest of it is bad, it just kinda all sounds the same, like a dull Rob Zombie clone. It's too bad because Bjorn Brem has an amazingly deep voice and is probably one of my favorite goth singers. Now all he needs to do is concentrate on rocking hard on more than two songs per album. Gothminister has more albums than this, but this is the only one I own, or have heard, so maybe I am being pre-judgemental in saying that. Check out Dancing Ferret records' website to sample a few bits of the songs before you buy this, but there isn't much to listen to beyond the first few tracks."
3,"The ""GLOW"" was broken!!!!","Doll was the average Bratz, yet the ""Glow"" for the jacket did NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!! Something to be cautious about if ordering for a Christmas gift!!"
5,ATTION all bratz fans please read this!,"Me , patrice and my lil cusin pinkiy love bratz .Yasmin is our fav.I m 9 and pattys 10 and pinkys 7.we love bratz and were try 2 get every bratz thing made.We dont think that they suck,we dont think that there slutty so enough of those wannabe myscene fans coming the bratz section and writing that us bratz fans suck and bratz suck and to all us bratz fans no more going in to the myscene setion and writing mean things .Their just dolls for heavens sake but can i just ask all u myscene fans when bratz came out did u still play with barbies or did u play with bratz because myscene is barbie."
1,Misleading Description,"These sheets are basically a plain set of cheap white sheets, with a pair of Falcon logo's pillowcases. Certainly not worth what was charged for this item. My son was very disappointed to open them."
1,"Similar car, same manufacturer","I don't have this exact car, but had a terrible experience with another RC car from the same company so wanted to share.My son got this as a gift for Christmas and within 24 hours of playing with the car, the transmission was stripped and the car would barely move. I have sent emails to the manufacturer a week ago and it took them over a week to respond. After several exchanges, theysaid they could not refund my money. They also said that since they were in Germany, they could not send a new car but they would send a new transmission that I could change myself. This was 6 weeks ago and still nothing. Very shady. Avoid at all costs. Overall a very disappointing experience. I would avoid this car and manufacturer."
1,a disappointing muddle,"A brief introduction to a great thinker should be clear, systematic, and fluent. Unfortunately, this book fails badly in all three respects. The prose is turgid and the ideas are very badly explained - I came away frustrated by the fundamental lack of clarity. The editor of this series was asleep at the wheel on this one - this book cries out for an editor's red pencil."
3,It's OKAY,You get what you pay for but this tablecloth looks better than that.Nice washable every day table cloth for square table. Good deal.
4,cool table cloth!,"My children love this (including my husband). When you put a cup on the table on a warm day and the cup sweats the little beads of water end up on the table cloth but they do not ubsorb into the cloth, they stay little beeds of water and you can roll them around and play with them. I wanted this table cloth because we have a square table and it's impossible to find a sqare one at any regualr department store. I do wish it was a little bigger but it fits okay. A lot of the newer high top tables are square now so you would think square table clothes would be easier to find but that is not the case."
5,High quality for the price,This table cloth feels great and looks like a very expensive cloth. Perfect size for use on a card table.
2,Not so Great.,"I bought this for my son's 5th birthday because have the ""Woods and Forest"" book in this series and love it. I was very disappointed in the Oceans. There are not many things to find on each page and most of them are pretty easy to find. The descriptions of the different fish are informative but as a hunt and search book I would not recommend it."
4,Great Album or Not?,This a a great albums for screamo fans. It alittle different then their first album but it's an improvement also. If you like these albums also check out Alexisonfire and Coheed & Cambria.Also this albums is a albums that you can listen to again and again and not get tired of it ever.
4,just short of great,"Make yourself sick is one of those CD's that you take out on a bad day and you can realate to all of these songs. Its for any lover of taking back sunday, yellowcard, or fall out boy. If you are into emo, punk, screamo, or just rock, this is the CD to own."
5,mind blowing album...,This is one of the best albums of all time.If you don't agree you need to listen to it again.Buy this album immediately.
2,Make Me sick,"Ok the guy before me said that this is the best cd you could own.... ok well i guess its all opinion because i wouldnt ever buy this cd. Make Yourself Sick isnt a bad album, but its not good either. Personally the only song i really enjoyed was ""I Got Punched in the Nose for Sticking My Face in Other People's Business"". I download this cd just because i heard that song but in the end it was disappointing and didnt live up to what that one song offered...it was like a really hot hooker with a vinarial disease... dont buy this cd at all costs, unless your like the guy below me... its safer just to get limewire and download it. End of story."
3,"Just ok, a bit out of date","I'm planning a trip to Tanzania, and though this book has some useful information, much of it is out of date. A couple of the websites recommended for safaris are obsolete. That, along with the fact that they mention how to take care of film for your camera (in the 2007 edition of this book), makes me question the freshness of any of the information. Things I would have like more information on:- Tips on how to get a good airfare from the USA- Voltages used (so I know what type of plug to bring for my digital camera)- More detailed information on how to book safaris and/or mountain treks.I'm glad I bought it because I didn't know anything before I started reading it, but this book could have been significantly better."
4,This is Space Cowboy.,"Great box set, Great special effect, good actor/actress, good story line. If you want to see Cowboy in the future. Take this one.But, who want to see a big action serie, think again. This is more drama than action."
5,"Wonderful, Imaginative Series","I recently saw all of these episodes and I had never before seen any of Joss Whedon's other TV series. This show is a very interesting reimagination of the science fiction genre, mixing sci-fi, western and even military ideas in one. The most important thing in this show, to me, is characterization. The characters on this show are very, very good. In addition to this, the show is funny, touching, gripping and probably the most fun I have had watching a TV show in a very long time. This is very highly recommended."
5,Firefly the complete series,"I am SF fan and always love a good story. These stories have what I call John Wayne ethics. A rare commodity, a program that a young person can watch, get something out of it, and still enjoy the adventure. For the older watcher fun stories. I wish there were more. I do not find anything on TV that is worth watching, but this, this is truly refreshing. I think that the casting was great, each actor perfect for the role, each charactor perfect for the part.Thanks Joss Whedon and the entire cast."
5,Firefly Rocks!,"I don't know why this was canned after the first season, it's definately Joss Whedon's best! The actors are great and really make their characters beleivable.I laughed, I cried....well you know the rest."
5,Great combination scifi and western that was prematurely axed by network morons,"It's not like Firelfy needs another good review, but I've been watching my DVDs that I just got last week, and am compelled to add my recommendation to all those that have gone before. I never heard of this show till a friend lent me one of the four DVDs a few weeks back (summer '05), It's a very smart show; very creative, with believeable and sympathetic able characters set in a galaxy of humans who seem to speak either English or Chinese. A mix of humor and drama, sci fi and western themes, and is true to both. Too bad the nitwits at Fox pulled the plug."
4,worked fine,I had to watch this for class and it worked fine. It froze a few times but that was because I had paused it for an extended amount of time.
5,Firefly Fan - better late than never,I never saw this on TV. I saw the DVD flyer when it was released and could not believe I had never seen a single episode. The box art and story line seemed interesting and I bought the set. I watched the entire series at a sitting. If you like scifi adventure this is a must own.
5,My favorite,"What can I say that has not already been said?While I love the cowboys in space feel, the characters are the real reason that I fell in love with Firefly. Everyone is a complex individual with a past. They are all realistic, flawed, wonderful, everyday people. This is a show told from the point of view of some average people who may or may not always be on the right side of the law. Most of the characters are not easily categorizes as ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". There are complications and shades of grey that add layers of interest. The stories told are interesting and realistic (well, as realistic as stories set in space in the future can be).The dialogue is witty, intelligent, and often downright hilarious.This is my favorite series and I will forever be sad that the many many questions have been left unanswered by the lack of additional seasons."
4,An interesting series for a 1 season show...,"I had never heard of this show until it was referenced on Big Bang Theory, and then I got interested. The reviews increased that interest until I finally decided to buy it.The show is engaging, and the characters are generally believable in the setting where they live. I am happy that I watched the series, and if I had been watching it when it was aired, would have been disappointed when it wasn't picked up for another season... but as it is, I knew that it had a definite end, so I could be prepared to be left hanging.It beats much of what is on TV, so go ahead and buy it and watch it instead of some current garbage for a couple of months. :)"
5,best TV show,This is the best TV show I've ever seen. You feel with the characters and laugh with them. They just exude energy and love for the show. I feel Mal's love for his crew and know why Simon sacrifices everything for his Sister.You owe it to yourself to go watch Firefly.
5,One of the best sci-fi series of all time,"What else can I say, it's simply one of the best sci-fi shows ever made. Killed off WAY too soon..."
4,Waiting for the italian version...,"I bought this set for two reasons: to be able to finally see at work my (then new) Blu-ray player and because also loving this series, despite the passing of the years, there is not even a whisker of an Italian version, although at the time Firefly was broadcast on pay per view italian channels.For the rest, there is little to say, the events narrated in the series are well known, the quality of the product, as well, and I am grateful that - not being a native English speaker - can I obtain the subtitles that are, as always, of a high standard."
5,Best Sci-Fi Show Ever,"Imagine a world where the everyone is Han-Solo or Dirty Harry, then throw in the X-files conspiracy guys and Bonnie, the cute mechanic from Knight Rider.Firefly is hard-core, old-school sci-fi. The characters and world are rough, dirty, and dangerous. Technology only gets the characters into trouble, not out of it (smart wits and a steady trigger finger get them out of trouble). There is no sound in space. If your space-ship breaks outside the solar system, you don't invent a warp drive. You run out of air and die.This show is smart, funny, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It pains me to admit that the one season is worth the whole runs of Star Trek, Babylon 5, FarScape, StarGate, etc. Buy it now.-m"
5,the blu ray is fine,"I don't think the blu ray on this modern classic series is defective in picture. They didn't shoot this with hd film anyways. The show is as excellent as ever and worth adding to your collection. The whole show is engaging and character driven and just plain good, although the westernized outfits seem strange even to me sometimes, however the outer planets are outposts and you'd make do with what you had. Still some of the machinery on those planets is too primitive perhaps for some viewers , the whole show still hits a home run imo though. IT's just great."
5,yay! Firefly!!,"I love this series, bummed it lasted only one season but alas, I have learned to just pretend it's one loooong movie! LOL Anyway, it came in the mail way before I was expecting it. It was in exactly the condition described. NEW. :) Fast service, Great product!"
4,Best TV show ever!,What an incredible show! This copy arrived promptly with minor damage to the cases. DVDs are on good condition.
5,Not suprised by Fox,"Any show promoting the basic tenets of old America...self-reliance, community, anti-totalitarian or government attitudes wont last long unless the PEOPLE demand it. There is power in masses.Anyways, I saw the movie in the theater.I liked it. Then I saw the DVD...and I liked it more.Why? I DONT KNOW! Something about it grabs you!"
5,Make more episodes and I will buy them!,"I suppose Firefly does not need yet another rave review, but I cannot resist adding my comments. (And this is the first time I have posted a review on Amazon.) My wife and I have been watching these episodes on DVD and are frantic because there are only two left to view. Our college-age daughter told us about this show. I went to see Serenity in the theatre with her and her friends and loved it. My wife and I got hooked on Firefly with the very first episode on DVD. This series is so good it could have been on HBO. I plan on buying the Serenity DVD and I would gladly purchase any feature-length sequel or any set of additional TV-style episodes. I fear that the television and motion picture industry is so devoted to producing least common denominator crap that they will not revive Firefly, but if they did, I would buy it."
4,Made me want to watch the movie,"Since the episodes are in the order in which they were originally intended, rather than the order in which they aired on TV, it puts the story in perspective. Designed to surprise the viewer, the show turns the genre on its head. After watching this, it made me regret that no episodes more were available, so I rushed out to see the movie. Like most of Whedon's shows, it is an ensemble piece and the characters are delightful, the ship most of all. (4 stars because it stopped mid-season)."
5,Fox's folly,"This show make's all the Star Trek's, Stargates, Babylons and the like(most of which I'm also a fan)seem like dinner theater. The look and feel is like you would expect if 500 years had passed and things like dirt and wind and animals still existed. Not some sterile hospital-like, ceilingless spaceship sets or foam rocks on a soundstage with the standard ""purple alien sunset"" backdrop.To the morons at Fox. First you allow yourselves to be a totally partisan, therefore unreliable, GOP propaganda spewing machine and then you let one(actually several)of the most finely conceptualized and intelligently written television series, slip through your fingers. Oops. GOP and intelligent in the same sentence.Kudo's to Universal for the upcoming feature film(and thanks for UHD). Now to start those Sci-Fi channel(or better yet, UHD?)reruns to usher in the movie this Sept. Get the DVD set just in case. I'm not sure Universal owns the rights to the original series. I believe Fox distributed the DVD."
5,An Amazing Show That Neesd To Be Brought Back!,"From the brilliant mind of Joss, the creator of Buffy and Angel, comes un interesting mix of Sci-Fi with a Western theme. At first glance I'd never have watched this show, but after the first episode or two I was hooked. I'm guessing that the western twist probable kept many would be fans from even giving it a try, but I assure you, this show is a blast. I really hope that it is not too late for the networks to get a clue and pick the series back up."
5,Quality!,"Why this series was cancelled after 14 great episodes I do not understand. It is an intelligent series with appeal to all age groups. There has been plenty of reviews already but let me just add my voice to what a great series this is. The acting is good. The dialog is strong (and funny). The characters are interesting. The story is entertaining. The episodes do vary a bit in their quality, but overall the first season of this show comes out shooting."
5,Best TV show ever!,"Although I'm an avid reader and film watcher, I've never taken the time to post an Amazon review. I'm doing so for Firefly in the hope that some TV exec somewhere will bring this remarkable show back. Each episode was a huge affirmation of heroism, rationality,independence,and integrity. So rare to see such portrayed in the wasteland that is television..."
4,This was a good buy,When it was first aired I was only able to catch a couple of the episodes. And then when they rereleased it for the Sci Fi channel It wasa t a time I was not going to be able to watch. This way I have it when I want to watch in my time frame. The commentaries are very good and the gag reels are fun to check out too. Also it is nice to be able to catch the whole series and understand the dynamics behind what is going on especially with the movie comiing out in september 2005.....
5,Worth the purchase,"On my Panasonic Plasma television, you can definitely see a marked improvement over the original dvd's resolution, though not a dramatic one for the most part. Scenes involving a lot of light and tight focus are of course best suited to the high-def transfer. The sound, on the other hand, is WAYYYYY better! The additional commentary on ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" as well as the lunch discussion with the cast members and Joss Whedon is almost worth the price of admission. If you have a great sound system and television, get it. Otherwise, the dvd will suit you just fine and at half the price :)"
5,5 stars and not over-rated,"Someone must have hacked Amazon's rating system. That is what I thought when I saw that this series had 5 stars with over 2000 reviews. But the accolades are well deserved. I am not a TV watcher. I never watched a whole episode of Star Trek and I found Star Wars boring. But I loved this series. It is beautifully acted,witty and irreverent. I have shown it to a half dozen people and they were all enchanted."
2,Good- but not a classic-too much immorality,"I know I'm going to get low scores but here goes. Right off the bat mybiggest complaint is the over the top sexual and violent situations.35 years ago this show would have been rated R which is what I would give it. I bought this set based on the recomendations of others on Amazon.You can have a decent show without all the immorality. Stargate Atlantis blows this show away and doesn't have near the sex and violence of firefly.The idea of a futuristic Western is good but I thought Joss Whedon should of had more ""Western"" in the series. I don't consider this a classic like Stargate,the early Star Wars, Dr.Who or Star Trek. The actors were a great choice and they did have the spark of a cast that seemed to bounce off each other well."
2,Don't believe these reviews,"I bought this series after reading the glowing reviews on this list. This was a serious mistake. This series is flawed to the point of tawdryness. The characters are cardboard stereotypes (the hooker with the heart of gold, etc), the situations hackneyed, the dialogue cliched, the plots boring and predictable, the production values second-rate. In addition, the casting director seems to have chosen a group of actors who are uncharismatic to a degree that one would not conceive was possible except by direct intent. The standard of excellence for such series is the new Battlestar Galactica; this series is not worthy to lace up BG's space boots."
2,Firefly season 1 - blu-ray,"I loved Firefly till Joss Whedon kinda ruined it by killing off half of the team in the Serenity movie instead of rebooting the franchise. This said, the blu-ray looks very grainy and all of the space scenes looked out of focus. I don't really think one have to blame the lenses on this one: when you are selling High Definition, you're expected to give High Definition, not low-def rendering of the CGI's and ultra compressed episodes cramped in the smallest set of blu-rays. Not happy."
1,product description not accurate,The DVD was fine but does not contain the three un aired episodes as stated in product description.I bought it solely for the three extra episodes so was very disappointed.
4,Fun show... any recommendations for a better one?,"I enjoyed the shows a lot, but I certainly didn't expect ""Firefly"" to be real science fiction. It reminded me of some of the humorous episodes of Star Trek. We certainly didn't demand that Star Trek be excellent, just that it be entertaining. ""Earth II"" has been the only sci-fi television show that I've seen that really explored possibilities in a mostly intelligent fashion.Speaking of which, I wish there WERE some really GOOD sci-fi TV shows... if anyone can recommend such, I would be grateful!"
5,new fan,"I just recently finished watching the firefly series, one of my roomates got the series for x-mas. This series is awesome, it has great writing, it is suspensful, funny, dramatic and has the action as well. The characters aren't paper cut outs either, each having a pretty deep and meaningful purpose in the show. It is awesome to watch a show and be able to figure out how a character will because you know that character and what motivates them, like in Heart of Gold when Jane decides to help with the job ;) . Sadess thing about the series is that it got cancelled so buy it and maybe it will get picked back up again."
5,Excellent series that will be missed,"I really can't add anything new that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of previous comments....if you like watching a show with excellent writing and characters, buy this DVD set.I have never bothered preparing an ""online review"" such as this before, but I was so impressed with this show, I felt it necessary to show my support."
5,Don't let Fox's mistake cost you this show-it's great!,"This is the only TV show I would ever own on DVD. Smart, funny, consistent, involving, well, what can I say that hasn't already been writen in the over 1000 other posts praising this set. See you at the movies when 'Serenity' hits the big screen."
5,Great series,Firefly is a series that should have had a better shot at making it than it did. If you are a fan of sci-fi and westerns than this is a combo of a show that should not dissapoint.
5,let's hear it for DVD,"Gene Roddenberry is said to have sold Star Trek to the studio ""suits"" as ""Wagon Train in Space."" Maybe Firefly could be called ""Outlaw Josey Wales in Space"" (insert reverb sound effect). I will not recap the plot, or the well deserved denunciations of corporate bean-counters for not recognizing what a gem this show was and strangling it in the crib. These can be found in abundance in other reviews. I simply wish to add to the chorus of viewers who say that this was amazing TV - not a phrase I find myself using much these days. Great concept. Great actors. Great dialogue. Great special effects. Great fun. I missed the show during its initial run. I am delighted to have found it on DVD. Highly, highly recommended."
5,I was hooked BEFORE I ordered it and glad I did!,"I would just be repeating all of the wonderful reviews if I went into detail, but I was hooked into this DVD before I ever saw the first episode. I had never heard of Firefly before July, 2004, as I was living in an area without access when it first appeared. I was told about it by an online friend who worked as an extra in the upcoming movie, Serenity. Ordered it sight unseen and have watched it three times already and am showing it to anyone who will sit still! This is entertaining, character-driven sci-fi at it's best. The posibilities are unlimited and we can only hope it's a long and productive franchise."
5,A Great television show,"I'm not a sci-fi fan, per se, but my wife got me hooked on Firefly since the re-running of the series began on the Sci-Fi Channel. The best thing about this show is the producers put the characters (all human, a big plus), plot and a sense of humor way ahead of the sci-fi aspect of the story. In doing so, the sci-fi elements are much more realistic and believable. You might call it low-tech sci fi. Whatever you call it, it works.Possibly,if the feature film, Serenity, does well, a smart network exec will get this show back in production."
5,Great show,Loved it. Great show. Very happy to find on blu ray. Glad to be able to own. Awesome buy. Makes great gift as well
5,Great,"Great set, great picture, great show, sad that there is only 1 season...Very cool commentaries and special features are included in this set."
5,Awesome!,Bought Firefly on sale for my husband. i was unsure if I was going to like it but we are about half way through and it is turning into one of my favorites.
5,fun,This series was just plain fun. Our family is savoring these eposides by spacing out the watching of them. Look forward to any movie from this show.
5,Must have.,I don't own a blu-ray player and I just ordered the blu-ray set. That's how much I love this show.
4,Very entetaining sci-fi series,I purchased this as a gift for my step-daughter as both my husband and I received this series as a gift a few months ago. We watched the entire series and thoroughly enjoyed it as we are big sci-fi fans.
5,Bring Back Firefly!,"Easily the best show there is/was.This show got it all.. great characters, storyline, spaceships!, humor,...This said, I NEED more! Bring it back ;-)"
5,Good Show!,"Honestly, this is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. The cast worked so well together and the scripts are, funny, full of action, great science fiction. Blu-ray quality is the best available, so you can't go wrong there. If you are looking for some TV entertainment without boring dialog and pointless, uninspired twists, this will leave you completely satisfied; even craving more, though more will never come.(tears falling onto keyboard)"
1,"Firefly, a word of caution","I enjoyed the series very much, and was surprised to see that there were some episodes that were not aired, and that was the main reason for buying this set. However all of the episodes that are in this collection WERE aired on the Sci-fi channel in the UK. I don't know if this is true in the U.S.A., but this makes the cover statement at the very least misleadind. There is even a reference to 'Objects in Space' in the special features section as having been aired. It's possible that they mean the DVD versions are different to the ones that were aired, but if that's so WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THAT!"
1,Not Even Close.,"simple. it failed. joss whedon is a hack and he has friends in high places. a movie? come on. fox has a habit of canceling great shows like family guy, futurama but i'm glad they cancelled this muddle.better than Farscape? obviously not a true scifi fan. i do not reccomend anyone getting this. pick up Farscape instead."
1,Firefly was canceled for good reason,I have to say this is a terrible tv show. Its funny how your allowed to put your comments here yet just for giving your honest opinion on this show you get crucified. The fact is that Firefly was canceled cause it sucked and the movie will bomb as well!
1,Firefly is no Buffy,"After the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, creator Joss Whedon decided to explore another popular genre being set...in space! Although the show had it's moments it wasn't that great. You would think a Trekkie and a star wars geek combined could do better. I think whatever he had has been lost. Save your money. There was a reason this show was cancelled so soon..."
1,Where's the 5.1 track?,"All's I see is a 2.0 track, where is the 5.1 track? This is 2005... 1 star because it's the greatest Sci-Fi TV show ever.-Chris"
5,An Enjoyable Sci Fi Series,This is an excellent series that left TV too soon. Shepard Book was a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. Ron Glass a great comedic actor from Barney Miller raises the bar in this role. Gina Torres is just great. As a warrior woman and the first officer of Serenity she is great. Her athletic ability and acting are superior. If you get a chance check out Gina Torrres in Alias. The rest of the crew is made up of actors who work well in this show. Watch the series in the order that Josh meant you to see it then watch the movie Serenity that tells the back story of River Tam. The bond between Gina Torres and Nathan Fillion as soldiers who fought a war together and now our travelling the cosmos is well done. It is not the antiseptic space of Star Trek instead it is a gritty adventure series. Check it out you will enjoy both the movie and the series.
4,Just Buy It Already,If you don't own this or haven't seen Firefly just buy it and you'll be very pleased. This is one of the most original series I've seen in years. It looks great in HD and has a variety of extras that make it even better.
5,The Best Show That Never Got a Chance,"I'm sad to say that I didn't discover this show until after it had been canceled, and the show is so good, I feel guilty for that fact. Fine writing, acting. Original, yet, not at all. You don't know whats coming but it has the familiarity of your favorite pair of shoes. I can only hope the feature film is a huge success because I want to see the adventures of Serenity and it's crew for years to come."
5,Short-lived show gets the recognition it deserves,"With its unique blend of science fiction, western, action, and humor,Fireflyhas gained and maintained a loyal following after being cancelled from the FOX network years ago. Since its untimely demise on television, the series has spawned a feature-length movie (Serenity), a comic book, and this full DVD set that lets fans relive all of the series' wonderful episodes, and revisit the characters they've come to love. People new to the show will be happy to have discovered this gem, so sit back and enjoy the ride. This DVD set is a must-have for both old fans and new fans alike. You won't be disappointed."
5,Don't miss out...,"The cancellation of Firefly is one of the great crimes against television committed in the last 5 years. You may be wondering why you would want to consider watching a television show that didn't even last a full season. The answer is simple. You don't want to miss out. This show is smart, funny, exciting, and even thought provoking. Why didn't it make it then? Because people didn't give it a fair chance. Fox put it on Fridays, and that was just a hugely unfair thing for both the television watching public and the show. Despite this obstacle, Firefly instantly created a hugely fanatic following that worked hard to get the show put back on television. In 2005 they got their reward with the release of the movie ""Serenity"", and it was one of the best reviewed movies of that year. Watch this show and discover why people are so passionate about it."
5,Simply Doesn't Get Any Better,"I don't watch television because it is generally mindless. I saw this through renting and then buying the firefly series on a blind buy. What I don't understand is how something this good got made in the first place. I can see how Fox missed the boat and now must be kicking themselves. With the sets built, characters established and a serious fan base in place why would they not bring it back. What a media story that would be. It's gotta be better and more stable than their newest fare."
4,Why are there no more episodes???!!!,"I am a huge fan of Buffy and Angel. Since this show is by the same people, I knew I would like it. I simply underestimated just how much I would LOVE it. I couldn't help going on to the next episode until there weren't any episodes left. The theme song is stuck in my brain and I don't mind it being there. I am clamouring for more episodes!! Why was this show cancelled in the first place??? Can't wait for the movie."
3,"Good product, disappointing shipping","The collection is what i had hoped for, the 3 business days it took before being shipped were not."
3,"Not as GREAT as everyone says, but good.","I bought the Firefly Blu-ray after reading tons of rabid fans screaming that it was the best show ever made. I am a big fan of Star Trek TOS and TNG and was excited to find a new exciting show to stimulate the brain as well as entertain. While Firefly is better than most shows on television, it is not the best. I would suggest it to fans of sci-fi looking to see something slightly new, but other than that rent it before you buy.The Blu-ray quality jumps between really pristine video quality to grainy effects (added for effect). First buyers go Blu."
5,why so expensive?,"I agree with the other reviews,cancelled too soon,one of my all time favs,but why does it cost so much here at Amazon?You can find this for less than 20 bucks at Target.Long Live the Browncoats!!!!!!"
2,Wrong format?,"I love the series and some of the special features on the DVD were great. BUT when I tried to play it on my computer, I got the message that it wasn't formatted for my area, something the buyer failed to mention."
2,Let's get real here....,"Problem with this episode, is that the bad guy didn't die.. Seriously, he should have been so dead. I am retired military, and he would have been dead, dead, dead.... Writer's f/u'd on this one... Makes it a loser....."
3,shortchanged,The show is 5 stars but the received DVD set is 1 star due to missing Disc Two and instead having TWO Disc Threes. A shame.
5,Am I crazy?,"I didn't really know what to expect from this show, but was pleasantly surprised. Why this show got cancelled is beyond me. I must be crazy, because this show is outstanding. What a mess with the network airing the pilot and other episodes way out of order and not giving this show a better chance. It's just plain insane. I can only hope that another network can bring it back, or for a Firefly movie, because this is an excellent show in an excellent sci-fi world. A real quality mix of drama, comedy, sci-fi, and western, and it all works."
4,A nice surprise!,"I never got to see this series when it was on TV and I am so glad there was a DVD to get because this is an really good show. Little too much on the blue side for normal TV, but cable should have picked this one up. I am not sure if I like the Western part or the fact they are several hundred years in the future and a bit on the Si-fi side. I can understand why this is a cult favorite. Haven't finished the whole DVD yet, but really like what I have seen already."
5,Awesome Buy,"Firefly fan of many years and now I finally got it on Bluray, picture quality is incredible, sound is amazing, price was great.The extras are amazing, such insight into Whedon's vision and the actors of the series."
5,Doing the Impossible Makes Us Mighty,"Wow, that about sums up how I feel about this series. Thanks to Fox's refusal to advertise the series, I didn't know about it until it was too late. I am a fan of all things Whedon (Buffy & Angel), but even I have to admit that this truely is his swan song. The cast is perfectly intune with their characters and each other. This show is filmed so cinematically it feels like you are watching 1 hour movies, not episodes. The special effects are phenomenal. The 14 episodes made me laugh, cry, but mostly they made me mad (this is what going mad feels like), because there are no more. I pray for a movie and until then I watch and rewatch my episodes, you should do the same. Take my love, Take my land, Take me where I cannot stand. You can't take the sky from me."
5,Not sure how this concept works so well...but it does.,"I'll openly admit that I'm in the group of people who had never even heard of Firefly until recently. My sister, who's a few years older than myself left me borrow it.The first episode was a bit of an odd...futuristic space ships mixed with cowboys is a bit odd, but the series keeps getting better and better. My wife and I could not get enough of this series. We watched the entire series in a span of 3 days. Wonderful series, I'd highly recommend it. And if you've only watched the first two or three episodes and can't get into it give it a shot, it really takes off around disk 2."
4,Great picture,"There is definitely an improvement in the picture quality in this version. The new special features are also cool and definitely nice to have new items. The sound quality is better, but DTS HD Master Audio can sometimes have strange emphasis. It can affect the voice tracks sometimes. There's also a strange error that can occur after watching a couple special features. On my player the screen would turn Green while I would hear the main menu soundtrack. My IC's whent caput about a month after I watched this, so it's possible it was a TV issue and not an issue with the disks. I have a Samsung BP-5000 with latest firmware, so I'm not thinking it was the player.UPDATE: Still could be the player. Replaced my Panasonic CRT HDTV (1080i) with a Samsung HL61A750 and will get this occasionaly. Looks even better in 1080p."
4,Outstanding Show,"This show should never have been canceled, but I understand why it was. The depth of the characters and quality of the scripts made for a great show, but it was taking too long to develop. A full season would probably have built a large enough fanbase to carry it for years. Anyway, the dvd set is worth every penny, what with the episodes and extras."
5,"Watch it, please",One of my favorite shows... follow it up by watching the movie Serenity. The only downside is that you'll spend the rest of your life sad and angry that it was canceled so soon.
5,What can I say...,"...that hasn't already been said in the 1500+ reviews of this series? Thoroughly entertaining, witty, thoughtfully written, attentive to detail, and technically sensitive, Firefly is in my personal top 5 list of favorite all-time shows. It was truly saddening to become attached to the characters and story line as I completed the series knowing that when it was over...it would be over. I'm glad Whedon was able to release Serenity and hope it will be a huge success on DVD! Who knows, maybe there will be a Serenity 2 or 2nd Firefly season???Qu ni de FOX!!"
5,Excellent Series,"One of the best written programs ever made for television. Once again, network execs refuse to see the gold in their midst. The series is a blend of old west meets final frontier with characters that are real, and believable.The series contains 4 disks with all episodes made of the series including the original pilot and three episodes that never aired. Programs are in widescreen format and overall good quality disks. The sound is crisp and clear, and the video is very good overall though there are some problems with blacks getting grainy.If you didnt find the serie when it was airing, and lets face it they did make it easy to find, don't miss your chance with the DVD's."
5,This show needs to be rebooted ASAP,I *LOVE* this show. I discovered it only earlier this year thanks to my husband purchasing the series and I am SO disappointed to learn that it was canceled after such a short run. It's right up there with Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. It deserves to have the whole story told and I hope that it gets a second chance!Bring back Firefly!
5,firefly_the_gratest,"I think, that everyone who bought it knows what is the best :-) The second season... Maybe... Someday... Many greets for all FUNS :-)"
2,Try Again,"I'm sure it didn't help that the premiere episode of Firefly was preempted, at least on the west coast (by a baseball game, if I recall correctly). Those of us who set our VCR's to record it missed it. That said, I did try to watch the subsequent episodes, but I just couldn't get into it. By about the third installment, I realized that every single character in the show could be killed off, and I wouldn't care. So much for Firefly. Please try again with something else, Joss."
1,FOR THE SIMPLE MINDED,"There was a good reason this show was cancelled...it sucks! If you are highly intelligent you will not like this mess of a production. The sound track is ridiculous, the dialogue is lame, and the fight scenes are amateur hour intense. I viewed all the great reviews and was misled. If you haven't had an original idea in years you may find some comfort, but basically I would stay away if you really thirst for something new and intense, something well written, which this is not. All the small town barn dances or country whatevers almost drove me mad with boredom. If I wanted a western with dancing I would have rented something from the 1950's. This is somewhere below science fiction, somewhere way below. A total waste of money unless you are simple minded or have a red stain on your neck."
1,Wow . . . this was bad!,"I had high expectations. I had heard from several Battlestar Galactica fans that this was an ""awesome"" series, almost as good as Battlestar, so I bought the DVDs . . . uh, No, this is not great science fiction. It is a silly, over-the-top melodrama set in an improbable future with some really bad acting. It's a comic Western (they even talk in campy 19th-century cowboy-speak) set on a space-barge whose crew flies from one ill-concieved scheme to escape-the-law, get-rich-quick, save-the-girl, save-the-universe to another and somehow gets out alive before the end credits. I'm trying to think of another show with a similar flavor, and for some reason, I have to say ""Desperate Housewives"" meets ""Brett Maverick"" in space -- very campy and contrived."
1,A real stinker,"The worst, cheesist show ever made. Weak characters and cheap special effects. It sucked all the way. The serious scenes were funny and funny scenes were children garbage."
1,Look at the Used.... Look at how many wanna get rid of it...,Look at the Used.... Look at how many wanna get rid of it... CHEAP... I remember this show out of 9 episodes I've watched there was only 1 episode that was above average the rest was way way below par of BAD... Save Your Money Get Them An AMAZON Gift Certificate or Just send cash....
5,Firefly,I have purchased six copies of this item. One for me and five for friends/family. Really great series that got little play. I'm so glad to see they have made the movie.
5,An incredible series only cut short by the short-sightedness of TV executives,"The problem with critics is they watch to criticize. This series has a wonderful storyline and does a great job of portraying real life in a storyline that you can become a part of.I, for one, believe the western theme does fit into the sci-fi realm. While it takes getting used to, you find it becomes a natural part of this story."
5,somthing special,I've never written a review before but I just finised watching Firefly (with it's companion covie Serenity. I have to say that I regret that there is not more of this series than there is. It is truly something special.
5,There is HOPE!!!,The movie comes out at the end of September and from what I understand there are two more on the way!
5,Phenomenal Show,"I'm sad there's only one season of Firefly. The characters in this series are fun, interesting, and bounce off one another excellently. It's a great lead into the Serenity movie as well. My only negative comment is that the tv series has a slower pace than the movie, but the characters are great enough that it's not a detriment to the star rating. 5 stars!!"
5,Great show. Too bad it only had 1 season,"An awesome show. Too bad I did not find out about it until it was already canceled. A friend recommended it to me and lend me his DVD set. I loved it. The humor, the unique & colorful characters, and awesome casts and acting. It is truly ashamed that some dumb network executives can't see a great show even when it is right in front of their faces."
5,Most Enjoyable Sci-Fi in a Long Time,"I heard of this series from a review on NPR's 'Fresh Air'. Intrigued about the fact that Fox had so butchered a good show, I checked it out. It was quite simply great! I rented it from Netflix, and couldn't wait for each disk to arrive. I was truly sorry after I had viewed the last one. I know there is serious talk of a movie, but I really hope that some company funds a comeback of the series. It could really go. This series made Farscape look like something targetted to 7 year olds (and maybe it was). Sincere kudos to Whedon and Minear and double kudos to the casting director for finding Morena Baccarin (OMG!)."
5,What a gem!,"We saw 'Serenity' over the holidays, and promptly bought the 'Firefly' dvd boxed set. What joy - to discover such a wonderful series now. What heartbreak - to know that only these few episodes exist. We tried to ration them out to make them last longer, but couldn't stop ourselves from watching another and then another, and another. We just finished watching the last episode and are devastated - there is no more! It went way too fast. Yes, it could be classified as science fiction; and yes, there is occasionally, sexual content, but give it a try. The characters are diverse, yet each engaging in their own way, and the cast is superb. It is a series that is so enjoyable as to almost be addicting. We are certainly going through severe withdrawal. It is a gem."
5,My favorite sci-fi tv series,"This is my favorite sci-fi series, though it's admittedly a space western if you're judging strictly. Excellent writing, direction, and cast. It's a shame it was cancelled so early in it's run. When I get depressed on seeing yet another reality show popping up on cable, Firefly still often gets a spin in the PS3."
4,Amazing series,"I can't believe I missed this when it was on TV. I remember hearing about it, but it was gone before I got a chance to come around to it. A friend recommended we check it out, and I have to say, this is an amazing series... it ranks up there with the best tv I have seen. It is approachable for the non-sci-fi/space western fan... my wife loves it. It took us an episode or two to get into it, but it was well worth it."
5,Outstanding series I missed,This is a great series with an amazing emsemble cast. I missed it while i was deplyed during 2003-04. Unbelievable dialog and believable situations that are really everyday problems. I can really relate!
5,"I'm not a sci-fi geek & don't watch TV often, but FIREFLY IS GREAT!!!","I first heard of ""Firefly"" when I got the series on DVD for Christmas last month. It is FANTASTIC!I don't watch TV a whole lot, and totally missed this show when it aired. I saw the movie Serenity which piqued my interest, and when I watched this series I was BLOWN AWAY. The casting is phenomenal, the writing is great and the acting is top notch! These characters & actors have endeared themselves to me in a way that no other series has. When I started watching, I couldn't stop until the series was done.Get this series for yourself, and get a few extras for a friend or family member. You will not regret it!"
5,Simply the best,This is the best tv show that I have ever seen. I miss it greatly. Watch it and you'll be hooked!
5,"AMAZING Show, DEFINETELY WORTH the money!","It baffles me how Fox was able to cancel this show, it is, without question, one of the best Sci-Fi shows produced in recent memory. If you like science fiction, or just good characterization, tight scripts, and great stories, then you definetely need to pick this up. The only negative thing I can think of in relation to this DVD is that there aren't any more episodes coming our way. The people at Fox are insane."
3,"Show is fantastic, but blu-ray looks grainier than DVD version","The show itself is one of the best sci-fi series I've seen in a long time. The stories are engaging, the character development is great, and the actors appear to have really 'clicked' together. I heartily recommend it.Now the bad news... the blu-ray version is sub-par. I own the series on both DVD and blu-ray, and was expecting the blu-ray to be a noticeable improvement. It was not. In fact, when I go back and compare the two, on some of the scenes the blu-ray actually looks worse than the DVD.The biggest problems appear to be the darkly-lit character scenes. On the DVD, they simply lack detail; on the Blu-ray version, they look grainy.On the whole, I would recommend the DVD version over the blu-ray unless your goal is to own only blu-ray format. The DVD version gets 5 stars from me; the blu-ray version, only 3."
5,Firefly series DVD set,"What is it about this series that so enchanting, engrossing, fun and immensely entertaining? Everything! The no name actors are brilliant in their performances. The direction inspired. The action builds up like a hot date and at the end of each episode you feel like smoking a cigarette. What's not to love about this series! Like a hot date, the memories leave you warm and fuzzy ... and wishing for more ... far more!!!"
5,Well written script and story line,"Because of the Movie Serenity (which I saw for the first time in late 2005), I purchased the Firefly DVD set (which I saw for the first time in May 2006). The script and idea for the entire show was well written. Character development was excellent as well!It is unfortuante that FOX canceled the series because I can see the show as having a lot of potential. If there is a rainy day, watch the Firefly Series and Serenity. Most individuals will throughly enjoy it because there are comedic and heartful moments. After you watch it, I think you'd wish that there was a second season of Firefly or another movie in the works."
5,"THE most original show missed by everyone, so don't miss it too!","This show is the only grudge I hold against FOX, totally making a mess of publicity and air dates that practically guaranteed the loss of this program.The writing is the most original. The characters are real, and what's more, honest about who they are and what they value. Forget political correctness or stereotyping - every show is a refreshing twist on TV episodic and character formulas, and I for one thank Josh and all of the actors and crews for giving their best on this series.I borrowed the disc set from a friend, saw it all, then had to buy it for myself, just to see it again and again. It doesn't matter if youre sci-fi, western, drama or comedy inclined - you get it all here.Highly recommended!"
5,Best Science Fiction Series ever!,"Clever, great effects, great actors, great scripts. What more is there? And the Bluray shows it all off clearly. Too bad there were so few episodes...although the follow-up movie, Serenity, provided some closure."
4,firefly revisited,I saw this series on TV and enjoyed it. I bought the DVD so I could watch it when I wanted to and also in order.I have enjoyed the series. It is different combining a western genre with sci fy.
5,Hilarious and you feel like a part of the crew,"I highly recommend watching the concluding movie Serenity too, the twist at the end is an awesome commentary on our current social ill - medicated humanity."
2,"Great Show, Horrible Copy","The low score is reflective of the copy provided on blu-ray, not the show itself. This is one of my favorite shows, ever, so of course I jumped on the great price for a blu-ray copy. But my old DVD box set looks better. Major disappointment."
5,Excellent show,This is the best DVD release of the season. I cannot stress enough how great this show is. I am looking forward to its arrival in the mail in a couple of weeks.
3,"Not bad, but not special","It's not that I don't love this show (I do) or found anything wrong with the ultra-slim design and delivery of this product, it's that I feel slightly cheated by the claims that this is a blu-ray disc.It's true, that this product does indeed play in a blu-ray player, and that the occasionally late-added cut scene, or graphic display, appears to be as crisp and stunning as my copy of Iron Man, but most of this series, for money-saving effect or just because it wasn't popular at the time, was not filmed in blu-ray, meaning most of this DVD is just the same show in the same format I would get if I bought the DVD.I didn't really need the discs, but when the deal came through my inbox AND it was blu-ray, I jumped on it. I'm not mad about my purchase, just slightly disappointed in the final outcome."
5,Amazing,"Firefly is an absolutely amazing show, and I'm so disappointed that I didn't find out about it until it came out on DVD. Though a space-western sounds like an odd mix, the characters and dialogue are so crisp, witty, well-written, and heartfelt that even non-scifi fans will enjoy it."
5,"Why this series went only 1 season, I will never know!","A friend of mine lent me this series before I purchased it. I had never watched Firefly when it was on TV - didn't even know it existed. Anyway, I watched the episodes back to back over the course of a couple of weeks, and discovered this is one of the best television series ever made. Sadly, it was cancelled after just one season; what a crime!The series is part sci-fi, part western - which sounds strange. But, this unusual setting works! The storylines are rich. The characters are complicated - making them very real. The acting is supherb. No buyers remorse here; I highly recommend!"
5,FOX Television is Wicked Retarded,"I must say that after watching Firefly - The Complete Series on DVD I am convinced that Fox Television is either A. Wicked Retarded B. Run By Satan or C. Freaking Crazy and Hates You. FOX cancelled this gem of a show? Buckfutters!This is an amazing series. If you like yourself at all, you must buy this DVD series and watch it repeatedly. If you don't like yourself at all, then you must love watching FOX Television because they don't like you either. Puhlease! How much reality television can one person stomach?I love this series.Shiny."
5,Excellent TV Show,"What's not to love? A Space-Cowboy TV show! I Wish it'd come back on the air. Bought the movie ""Serenity"" to with, but it's just not enough."
5,The horror is that Firefly was canceled,"The Bluray was very well done.I wish this show was still on. It is a shame that Fox decided to broadcast the episodes out of order, in a Friday night time slot with little to no advertising.If you enjoy SciFi then this is a great buy.The movie ""Serenity"" that was made after the show was canceled. It is more enjoyable to watch after you watch this BluRay."
5,It's Joss' world--we just live here.,"As a loyal citizen of the ""Buffy-verse"", I was so delighted to discover--shortly after my hearbreak over the incomprehensible cancellation of ""Angel""--that there was more of Joss out there yet to discover. (""The WB? They are like gypsies! Spit, spit! We shall speak no more of them!"") I saw ""Serenity"" in the theater and immediately came home and ordered the ""Firefly"" DVD. Please, God, tell me somewhere in the world there is a TV executive discerning enough to realize that Joss Whedon's work is a diamond glittering in the mountain of cow dung that is today's TV programming. Meanwhile, order ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" both--you'll love them and they'll provide a much-needed Joss-fix until such time as he emerges once again victorious with either a new feature film or TV series. You can't stop the signal!"
5,The authentic space cowboy opera,"Firefly is possibly one of the most original television series to have ever been created. It's fresh, funny and most importantly intelligent! Joss Whedon is one of the very few creators out there, that actually respects his audience and as such delivers a product that bows to no formula.The writing is superb and the actors interpret scripts with consumate skill. I am very attached to this series and would highly reccomend it to anyone."
5,Should have continued the Series,Loved it. so many ends that could have been explored in the lives of these rich players.
5,Firefly - The Complete Series,This is a Great Series!!! Superbly written stories that are not watered down by to many special effects.
5,Why would anyone cancel the best sci-fi show in years??,"If you have not purchased this show, DO IT NOW!You will not find a better sci-fi show to watch since Babylon 5. I cannot praise this show enough. If I were the fox executive who decided to cancel this show and then saw all of the DVD reviews on amazon etc.. I would probably have to get aboard a firefly with Mal and crew and escape from the planet.This show has it all: effects, music, fantastic acting, awesome story line, humor, a possible look at the future, and what most good sci-fi has a look at real situations that you can relate to in today's society but set in the future.ack! They cancelled this????Incredible......."
5,"""Shiny!""","Firefly was one of those rare TV shows whose early demise made me genuinely sad. I don't know how many other ""failed"" series have grown in stature and popularity after cancellation, but this DVD release is sure to make Firefly one of them.This treasure-trove contains the entire series in its correct order--far more logical and engaging than the order in which the network mindlessly aired it--including three episodes never broadcast during the Fox TV run in the U.S. In addition, all episodes are shown in wide-screen as the producers originally intended. The sound is crystal-clear. Cast-and-creators commentaries (available on about half of the episodes) are enjoyable and informative. AND there's an extras feature with gags and bloopers.With the minor exception of the slightly unattractive menus, everything about these DVDs is top-notch, as befits this outstanding series. For me it was like Christmas. Only three weeks early."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"I wish I could give this series a 10 out of 5 because it well deserved it. I am a scifi fan and there is nothing much I can add to the 700+ positive reviews at current, but I will say this...compared to the first 14 episodes of any scifi series, Firefly blows it out of the water. Some series take 2-3 seasons before they start to get really good....Firefly is great from the very begining....buy NOW and watch and watch and watch many many times. Oh and Fox I hate you people for what you did to this wonderfull series."
5,Great Show....Why Did It Ever Get Cancelled,"Really enjoyed this series. I never saw it while on TV, but the combination of Space Travel with old west type adventures I thought were great. The characters are really well presented by the actors. Bring it back to TV."
5,Firefly - The Complete Series,"Too bad this series didn't last longer. It had a little something for everyone: gunslingers and spaceships, government plots and tarts; action, drama, and comedy. It had good writing and a well-directed, excellent cast. The only bad thing about it is that it ends way too soon. It's a unique and original must-see."
4,Finally!,"Finally, after many months of waiting, the Firefly DVD has come out! The show was one of the best series i have seen in a long time. Hopefully, there will the unaired shows included on this DVD. I rated it 4 stars just because it hasnt come out yet. I still dont get why FOX canceled the series even though it was popular."
5,Most Underrated Series of all time,"Firefly was a show that my friend had recommended to me awhile back and I figured, why not, let me give it a shot. Well, it turned out to be one of my favorite shows of all time. With great characters, interesting setting, and witty dialogue, I had fallen in love with the show. It is just unfortunate that the show was canceled along with the fact that the episodes were aired in the wrong order. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves sci-fi and Joss Whedon. You will not regret it. Oh, and also buy the movie Serenity which finalizes this great series."
5,No sound in space! Since When?,"This series had to be one of the best sci-fi shows in ages. I come from the psuedo-nerd class who prefers Next Generation to Original and also like watching Babylon 5 for the epic battle scenes. What I liked about this series, besides its phenomonal writing and character development, is that it actually pays attention to the laws of physics. One of the most ignored rules of space, long dismissed in television sci-fi, is that there is no sound in space! None. If the Death Star crashed into a Borg Cube which then set off the Superlaser which shot at Deep Space Nine causing it to actually move which caused it to bunp the Intrepid into the Executor and then all of these things simulteanously exploded, you wouldn't hear a thing. Not one thing. Firefly actually grasps this concept which speaks volumes of its respect for what it is doing. Its was a great series, which is obviously why it was cancelled after one short season."
4,Firefly,"A thoroughly entertaining series with characters and dramas that engage you and have you asking for more; A series that has you immediately inserting the next disc in order to continue the ride. The only complaint? That there aren't more, to continue the adventure...."
5,How Could a Show like this Get Cancelled,"This show is awesome. I have been watching it and wondering how they could cancel a show like this. It is great TV. But they cancelled Angel, so I understand how stupid executives can be. I love it, and would really like to give it 20 stars."
5,Great show,"The music is so bad that it ruins the series for me. That annoying guitar playing over every moment when there should be a powerful orchestra is not only annoying but begs the question... what kind of genius thinks this is good?Whedon has a hardcore fanbase and if he is lucky then they will buy enough of this overblown bunk to allow him to make more crappy shows like Buffy and Angel. Oh, and this horrid mess.----------------------------------------------------------------Wow! What a creep. Did you get your reaction?"
5,fire fly rocks,"this is absolutely joss whedon's brain child the comedy, the adventure, the sub-text are all excellent if you love buffy or angel you'll love this"
1,Packaging Misrepresentation,"It is indeed most unfortunate that AMAZON is now misleading potential customers my using enhanced images of the product and then substituting lesser quality. I understand that we all need to be environmentally responsible in preserving the planet's resources by not wasting or over indulging however, a product of inferior quality is more wasteful as it does not stand the test of time. Unfortunately, it seems that the aforementioned ""business"" tactics are rampant on a planetary scale thereby creating even greater waste by marketing inferior products that must be replaced multiple times. This is the greatest threat to the planet's survival. Hopefully the ""powers that be"" shall eventually come to reason with this and place the future of the planet over immediate monetary gain."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I don't regret taking the time to watch Firefly, but I certainly don't feel like it warrants raving about. For starters the premise of prostitution being a highly regarded profession for which classy schools exist is such a ridiculously juvenile attempt at being confrontational. This show is more interesting than standard sci-fi fare (Star Trek, Stargate, Babylon 5), but that isn't saying much. It's not as good as Sliders, the plots aren't as well written, and the way they explore a new planet in each episode is a very similar premise. I would go as far as to call it shamelessly derivitive. Nathan Fillion was convincing as reluctantly responsible leader Malcolm, and River's psychological instability was interesting. The rest of the characters were predicable and one-dimensional. The show is worth watching, just not worth getting excited about."
2,beat up,"DVD's are excellant, but the packaging of each disc is a mess. It looks like it was run over by a lawn mower. Definately not in 'very good' shape as advertised"
3,One of the coolest shows ever!,Damn you Fox for cancelling this cool show! Shame on you for also cancelling John Doe! Please release John Doe on DVD ASAP!
2,A Sci-Fi Soap Opera.,"The basic concept and the production are very good. The actors stay fateful to their characters. But the characters are odd and not well developed or integrated. In particular the characters of the happy-hooker promoting pay-for-sex and homosexuality, and the mental-case playing the professional victim. They soon become a burden to the storyline to the point I did not finish looking at all episodes. There is a reason for the $22 new-price for a 675 minutes series..."
2,"Sad writing, poor use of talent","Good idea, poorly executed. And why Summer Glau, who plays the most interesting character, River,isn't given more to do is baffling. She had the same problem in Terminator, The Sarah Connor Chronicles. They sort of wrote her out.Summer, I know work is tough to get, but you have more to offer than the half roles they are throwing your way. Get a better agent."
5,Firefly,This movie is supper i loved it buy it my whole family liked it alotfrom start to finish if they had more i would buy it.
5,Awesome at it's best!,Firefly is only the most amazing series ever! It's got that Western Si-Fi thing going on. I highly recommend this series to everyone.
5,Great show!,"One of the best sic-fi series I've seen, it is a shame that they canceled it, but the few episodes here mixed with the movie are worth it!"
2,Probably the slowest western I've ever seen...,"Tired plots, over-acting, and a story arc that never got off the ground consigned this western to the TV graveyard in record time.I watched the first two heavy-handed episodes and I was not impressed. The story-lines were predictable--if not recycled. The action was sparse. The characters were trying so hard to be mysterious that they were uninteresting. What did impress me was how slow paced this show was. It was boring. Very little happened and when something did, it was not pulled off in an exciting way.This show wasn't canceled out-of-hand. It was canceled because it couldn't generate interest.I did like the cast though, and the production values, so I'm giving it two stars."
2,"Smart, but did not appreciate the values","Smart writing indeed. Purchased based on reviews here. However, did not enjoy some of the values such as making prostitution look attractive and 'good'. That alone ruined it for me in terms of being able to recommend it whole heartedly to others. I gave a copy away for Christmas before viewing the episodes - but wished I had."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this series , aimed mainly at teen crowd , mediocre music and camera work."
2,Firefly,"In my last review I stated that I was angry FOX took off 'Dark Angel' to air Firefly. Then another reviewer gives this big long explanation on why it was cancelled. Let me tell you something KAD, Dark Angel could have lasted at least 5 seasons. If FOX was serious about Firefly they should have aired the episodes in the correct order. FOX should have known Firefly wouldn't last if the story arch was out of order. So basically they took off a show that would have lasted to put a shown on that would be aired out of order. I think maybe if FOX aired Firefly in order it might have lasted 3 seasons, but since they didn't the world will never know. I'm sorry that I'm a hard core Dark Angel fan, but I don't know hy Firefly wasn't aired on SCIFI in the first place. It would have saved DARK ANGEL fan a loss of a great show.The only reason why I gave this show 2 stars is because it was very creative of Joss to think of a Space Western"
3,Firefly - The Complete Series,"great short series, but it may be better to spend the money on collecting some other series that have second season like stargate, buffy, or what ever othr choice is out there, if you like one time deal than it will be good, but there is no second season so thats why it suck"
5,What was Fox THINKING???,"Oh, right,..""thinking"" had no part in their decision to cancel this show!I'm not a crazed, organized fan. I'm a middle aged woman with college and two teens under my belt.I have bought and given away more copies of this show than I can count, because it is one of the best gifts I can imagine. Hours and hours of wit, humor, and heart.When's the last time you could say that about a tv show?I fell in love with these characters, every one of them. I mourn a little every time I rewatch an episode.I'm left with the only conclusion available to me,..Joss must have really pissed off someone at Fox,...or the crime of canceling Firefly could not have happened.Their loss, our loss,...now,..let's all go watch another episode of ""More to Love"",....nah,..I'd rather have some dental work done!"
5,Very enjoyable romp through space,"I discovered this series on Netflix. I really enjoy the characters and creativity this series has. Over the series, characters become more complex. I like the humor and commentary on today's society via the future."
5,The best show not on TV,"Firefly is a tremendous series - well written, lots of likeable characters, interesting plots, good action. I hope the planned movie will be a success and that the series will get picked back up. If you're looking for some good sci-fi to clear the bad taste of Enterprise from your brain, you need Firefly."
4,FireFly,"The future will belong to geeks and cowbows, cowboy geeks. Anyway, the 2 (I think) episodes not aired I did not like... Joss made the point about the cowboy thang and in those 2, it was a little overdone... the rest of the shows were balanced as far as the theme goes, and made sense in an orderly fashion, liked all that were aired and hoped to expand on themes, such as persons and personalities, there were too many questions about them and the mix, the only 2 clear relationships were Mal and Zoe.The firefly class ship is not scientifically feasible,among other oxygen and physics problems, I think solving those problems would had added life / longevity, to the series"
3,"Great series, discs lacking","I got this even though I already had the DVDs. Not impressed. The extras were pretty lame (lunch with the cast? - it was stupid). And the third disc would just not load at all. So, returned as defective and will stick with the standard DVD version. Got to say that, overall, I am not really impressed with Blu-ray."
3,Scenes Cut On Blu-Ray,"This was an excellent series, too bad it was prematurely cancelled. I was excited to get the Blu-Ray version but when I watched it I noticed some scenes had been cut on the BR edition. One example - towards the end of The Train Job - where the medical supplies are returned - is not on the BR version. I would recommend the regular DVD version of the series."
4,Great show - Cheap packaging,"I love this show. Joss Whedon hit a major home run and Fox was too blind to see that they had a hit in the making... at least with fans of science fiction and maybe, had they been a little patient, even more.That said, the lack of the fifth star in my rating is due to cheap packaging. I had previously bought the DVD set as I didn't know if there would be a blu-ray version (still waiting for Torchwood season 2 on blu-ray) and it is quite nice. It's a box set. Each disc has it's own sleeve with a different character on its cover and the all of these are in a box. However the blu-ray is cheap by comparison. A single standard plastic case with all of the discs sandwiched into it.It appears to me that Fox responded to the demand for a blu-ray version of this but only gave as much as it absolutely had to. I do hope the one reviewer is wrong and that the picture quality is better than the DVD set."
5,Oh why oh why did Firefly have to be cancelled?!,"This series is amazing, and Amazon has it for an incredible price. This is a must-see for any Sci-fi fan...and I also recommend purchasing the movie, Serenity. Phenomenal."
4,Firefly The Complete Series,"I missed Firefly on its initial release and found it to be really a good series, much better than a series like SGU. I was impressed to see how the stars have evolved over time and how many of them have major shows today. The acting was really good and the story line was acceptable, but lacked the creativity to make it a lasting series."
4,Firefly - The Complete Series,"I bought the series after seeing the movie ""Serenity"". I like the series so far (4 of 14). My wife who liked the movie but not so much the series."
5,Great Show,"I got the DVDs for Christmas. Sadly, I've now finished them. The commentary is by Joss Whedon for the most part. The shows are great; the dialogue is crisp. I look forward to the feature film."
5,Great Series that is no more.,"All I can say is that I am sadened by the fact that the series no longer exists. That's why I bought this blu-ray. It's a great show. Funny, action packed, good story lines and good acting. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
5,Exactly what television has been missing,"Every episode of this series is brilliant. I can't stand all the garbage on TV, and Firefly demonstrates what TV ought to be. The characters are original and well developed, the writing is hillarious and insightful at the same time, and all the episodes fit together to tell a bigger story. The story takes lots of unexpected turns, but if you go back and watch the earlier episodes again, you can see the clues that were cleverly embedded. On top of all that, the show is just plain fun -- a sci-fi/western combination with lots of action, shot in a way that makes it feel like you're there.It's too bad fox didn't give this show a fair chance. I didn't even know about this show until after it was cancelled, and it's the most innovative, exciting, and funny show I've ever seen."
4,Firefly followup,Word is Universal picked up the rights to this one for a movie deal. Don't be surprised if post-movie the series reemerges on UPN with some retooling. This might be the first chapter in a classic series. Here's hoping.
2,Hmmm,"I saw the first episode with my husband, and honestly we weren't that impressed. I got this DVD due to all the great reviews, but I would not buy this again. I will try to watch this and hope I will get into it. I am a huge Castle fan, so I thought I'd get this since the reviews were so good and since I like Nathan Fillion. So far unfortunately not that impressed."
5,Simply the best.,"There is no television-produced sci-fi that can come close to the pathos, humour and just overall awesometasticness (had to make up my own word to show just how cool) of this show.Buy it and enjoy, you can thank me later."
5,Firefly is a great western,"Many people see Firefly as a space-faring drama that is cavorting as a western, but it's probably more useful to see it as the opposite. Joss Whedon seems to care not a whit about science fiction in the usual sense, but what he does care about is the characters and the myriad of decisions that they must make alone, on the spot, and with real risks to life, diginity, and liberty. That's a good western."
4,Surprisingly good,"I did not expect much of a series that was cancelled after just one season, but it was free and I was in the mood for SciFi, so... I was positively surprised. The Western SciFi mix requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but after that, the characters are unusual, funny, and the story is interesting. I would have watched it for more than one season."
5,A Sci-Fi Classic!,"This is a terrific series, sadly cancelled too soon. A dramatic and, at times, funny adventure through 'the black'.Adam Baldwin is a particular favorite of mine. His Jayne Cobb is a mercenary with a deceptively good side. Made me laugh every episode. And I have to say it...a man mountain!All the actors are stellar and I can only hope, like Star Trek, they reunite every few years for another movie."
5,This Show Was Gone Far Too Soon,"Firefly is the television series that spawned the movie ""Serenity"". Both are considered sci-fi cult classics, and for good reason. The characters are engaging (the casting is, in my opinion, exceptional) and the action and plot are equally good. If you have not seen either of these works, I would recommend them very highly. The world that this show takes place in is both futuristic and not at the same time. The story takes place in space, primarily on a space ship in fact. Even so, there is more of a ""western"" feeling to everything than ""space-alien"". There are also Asian overtones to everything in the more populated areas. Somehow, this Space Opera-Western-Asian-style amalgamation is both endearing and strongly entertaining."
5,The best DVD set of the year!,"Simply outstanding. It is really a gem of a DVD. I loved all the extras and the special features. The commentaries were fantastic. The Hero of Canton was so funny, he made me cry. The special effects are like nothing else I had ever seen on television before. I would recommend this to any science fiction fan out there. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you will love the character interactions in this show."
4,Shiny!,"Very entertaining and mind bending series which mashes up Westerns, Eastern cultures, and science fiction.My only problem with the series was, that for all of the stuff they cribbed from Chinese culture, they had no Asian characters in it.My only problem with the DVDs was that I wish each episode had commentary."
5,Firefly,"This was a tv show that I wish would have continued. Interesting characters, good story lines. My husband really enjoyed this show. I ordered the Serenity movie at the same time."
4,Potential,"This series definatly had potential. I really liked the characters and the story line had some substance. I liked this because it didn't rely on stupid catch phrases, special effects, or sex to keeo viewers engaged. There was a brand new universe created and it was created with originality. I think I watched it too fast because I started to get tired of decifering their slang and I had to stop watching the DVDs for a month before I could finish them off. I do understand why it has such a cult following. It really grows on you and makes you want to see more, like any great sci-fi series. (After you get through the slow parts.)"
5,"It was the losin' side, still not convinced it was the wrong side.","Joss Whedon created a series that is at once brilliantly humorous and poignant, with elements of classic westerns and SciFi. Had it aired on the Fox Network of the 80's and early 90's it would have had a longer run, but that bunch have turned into corporate weasels and are not willing to let a show find an audience. I didn't see it on the original run on fox, but thanks to the SciFi channel I had the opportunity to view the series and become a ""Browncoat."" This boxed set contains all episodes including three that never aired on Fox. This set is well worth the investment and I highly recommend you join the fun!"
5,Outstanding Sci-FI,"This show deserved to be a modern SciFi classic, up there with Babylon 5 and Farscape as a real alternative to Star Trek. Firefly is an odd mixture of traditional spaceship show and a western all mixed in with bits of asian culture. (which was actually a nice touch I think).That this show was put on air out of order, without even the pilot episode being shown till the *end* of the series was a tragedy. When viewed in the right sequence, as shown in the box set, we have a wonderful and quite unique TV series with some great special effects thrown in.I got to the last episode and swore at the TV because there was no more to watch and cursed the stupidity of TV executives. (again)My only gripe with this box set of the show is that it is hard to find the episode commentries which are buried inside the ""language"" selection section for each episode."
5,Fox Made a BIIIIG Mistake,One of the best new shows to come out since Buffy the Vampire Slayer...watch for the major motion picture Serenity in 2005!!!
5,GREAT SHOW!!!!,"I loved this show and have not watched the Fox network since they canceled Firefly without ever giving this wonderfully written and produced show a chance to build an audience. I hope that everyone who loves good science fiction, excellent writing and just plain great entertainment will buy this DVD set, then drop Fox a note telling them just how stupid they were to let this gem slip through their fingers..."
5,I'll pay too!,"I totally agree with the other reviewer on how to save Firefly. I'll gladly pay to keep watching this terrific show. For the love of god, will someone PLEASE HELP us!!!"
5,Firefly,"This is probably one of the best Sci-Fi series that I have seen in a long time. It blends the Sci-Fi background with a western feel, very unique and very good. I highly recogmend it to anyone who loves sci-fi."
4,Sci-fi series,"I bought this for my husband because he had been watching the series and had missed some episodes. I have ended up watching it with him. It isn't Star Trek, but it's pretty good."
5,Love It,"Big Joss fan, very sad Firefly was cancelled, but since it's on DVD, I watch it whenever I want.Really wish they'd suddenly release a complete second season directly on DVD. I'd buy it on the spot."
5,Excellent,"Ever since I first saw the movie ""Serenity,"" in theaters, I have been a fan of the series. I was quite pleased upon purchasing this package that it was in perfect, new condition, and all episodes and special features are included in their entirety. I am extremely pleased."
3,its Blu-Ray but still just a DVD,"I bought it for the story line which I still like, but the picture resolution was still grainy, not Blu-Ray. Buy the DVD and play it on a Blu-ray will give the same picture quality."
5,Wonderfully Entertaining,"We loved this series, and were astonished to find it had been cancelled after such a brief run. Well-written, witty, with stories you want to keep following, it's a winner all around. Felt the same way about Stargate's first few seasons. Battlestar Gallactica? We watch it because there's nothing else to watch. But this is LIGHTYEARS better entertainment. Constantly losing, dying out, never getting any closer to any reasonable hope of survival, Gallactica can get really aggravating. You'd think they'd all get bored enough to just run into a fracking star or something equally final. Never got that loser mentality on Firefly! To the contrary, these people maintain hope and determination and integrity throughout the series and bring you right along with them. Buy Serenity, too. Good stuff."
5,Best Sci-Fi show in years!!!,"This show is awsome. A great mix of sci-fi and the wild west, which gives a great frontier and mystery to each episode as you try and guess what trouble they run into next. This show rocks."
5,Great short-lived series,"If you are reading this, you probably already know that you want this! Firefly was an excellent series, and was cancelled wrongly. If you like science fiction involving the edges of civilization, space pirates, and spaceship battle, you'll love this series! There's a definite 'Wild West' feel to this excellent show, and that aspect shows up in some places that will leave you rolling on the floor laughing!"
5,Best Series I've Ever Seen,"Firefly is the best TV series I've ever seen, not just the best Sci-Fi series I've ever seen. The characters have real depth to them, and the stories are rich in human nature. It is a tragedy the series' life was cut short by corporate shenanigans."
5,one of the top 5 must see Sci-Fi series,"Who in their right mind killed this series? Who ever it was should be dragged out into the street and shot with a photon cannon! This has a very powerful story, and enough humor and lighter sides to make it fun to watch over and over. Dont forget to pick up the Serenity movie to cap off the series."
5,Best SF Series,"I bought this a couple of months ago having seen only a couple of the shows when it was on FOX. Like many of the other reviewers, I was blown away by the series. I have watched it several times and look forward to seeing it again. I too am frustrated that the series was prematurely cancelled. Hopefully it will be picked up by one of the networks for additional seasons after the movie comes out. If you don't have this yet,order it now."
5,The greatest show ever canceled,"What more can I say. Firefly was a great show, well cast, beautifully shot and a genuine pleasure to watch. The only problem with the show is there isn't any more."
5,Mesmerising!,"This is fantastic!Being a big Buffy fan I was damn interested in Joss' follow up show and knowing little about it bought it as soon as it became available and I was not disappointed one bit.It has everything - action, humour, evil corporations, evil government, evil crooks, gun slingers, war buddies and telepaths! The writing is great, the production design is fantastic and Joss' skill as a director has come along in leaps and bounds.From the first episode you can tell that this show was destined to be cancelled - it just has an air to it that you can tell (or maybe you just know already) but this air of desperation just to keep going just adds to the character of Mal in particular and the beauty, grace and humanity of the show as a whole.I can't recommend this highly enough - buy it and fall in love for yourself!"
5,Best Sci-Fi show on TV in years,"What was Fox thinking dropping this awesome show, I loved the 3 non-aired shows. Joss did an exellent job and the actors just melded to one great cast. If you like great stories, even westerns, you love this series. Trust me..."
5,Best series on tv,"I watched this when it was actually on tv and was devastated when they took it off before even showing the entire season, or giving it half a chance. I was attracted to it because first I was already a fan of Joss Whedon't great writing and characterizations and second because I love sci-fi. I have watched the complete series on DVD several times and each time I laugh out loud and cry and am moved and want to be part of that wonderful, flawed crew. If you like great writing with humor and pathos and wonderfully real characters that are not one-dimensional then this is the DVD to buy. But if you have no sense of humor, lack imagination and don't care to think then don't bother."
5,One of the best scifi shows in recent memory,"As a sci-fi buff I have watched plenty of series in recent memory (next generation, deep space 9, voyager, lexx, dark angel, farscape, stargate), and would have to say that the only one that might compete with firefly since next generation is farscape. Missed firefly when it was on TV, but watched an episode off of the school network and bought the DVD's that week, have watched them through twice in about 6 weeks (which is exceptionally rare for me) and am anxiously awaiting Serenity, and hoping it is aired. With all the crap on sci-fi no (tremors, scare tactics...) here's hoping that they bring back farscape (mini-serious is coming) and that someone picks up firefly after the movie. Note, have watched buffy from the beginning and last season or 2 of angel, so firefly isn't the only Joss show I like, but I think it had/has the potential to be the best."
5,really enjoyed it,"This was a great movie, I only wish there was a sequel to it or more of the same kind of movie."
5,NOT BAD. NOT GOOD. IT WAS OUTSTANDING,"I've never written a review before. I've never bought a television series before. I've never been to a fan site before. Now I have.Possibly the best series I've ever seen. It's intelligent and low-brow (sometimes at the same time),funny, action-packed, sad, happy, mysterious, interesting, dramatic, high energy, relaxed and inspiring. All in the pilot.Buy it. Watch it. Go see the movie when it comes out.Add it to your cart now!"
5,Shot Down Before its Time,"When it was on the air I never caught a single episdoe of Firefly and now I feel sorry I did not. On a whim and at the suggestion of a couple friends I bought this DVD set and after seeing all 14 episodes I do not regret one bit the loss in my checking account. This series had such potential and Fox gave up on it with out seeing what it was going to do. There is other SciFi on the air that started slow but has become great (Stargate SG1, Andromeda, Farscape just to name a couple) but networks gave them a shot and they turned into gold for them. This release of this wonderful series from the Fox network is proof once again that SciFi never gets its due on the major networks. I am so looking forward to the movie as I watch my set of episodes a second time since getting it this weekend.(PS Am I the only one ticked that we will never get to hear what Shepard Book's story is now that this series is off the air?)"
4,Love this show,I had heard about this show and I finally sat down to see it. The characters are all well written and performed. There is humor and depth in each of the characters and I enjoyed the story lines. The adult content was a surprise and made this more interesting. Not a kid show.
5,The best sci-fi show ever! Hands down the best!,"This show had it all, a great cast, great acting, funny and smart with enough action and space thrills to satisfy almost any sci-fi enthusiast. Again Fox has proven how stupid they can be for not giving the show the chance it deserved, like Family Guy they canceled a show that had a true and loyal following. At least they saw the light and brought Family Guy back, maybe they should give Firefly another shot. On the other hand I think Whedon should stick it to them by make a few more movies. In any case a great show and very enjoyable, and they movie was just as good, well done Whedon, well done!"
5,"Brilliant, heartrending","You can read all about this show in the other comments, so all I want to add is that I fell in love with Firefly. We all have heard that it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. To this we could add that you shouldn't be so afraid of losing something that you won't try for it.Don't miss Firefly. This was something really special."
4,Firefly,"Enjoyed, wish there would have been additional seasons made. Never realized how many characters that are on shows that I enjoy now."
5,Gayle,"So sad this series didn't became a hit until AFTER it was cancelled. As for me and my house, brown coats rule!"
2,Good acting despite horrible writing,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan in general, but this series suffers from a nonsense implementation of an otherwise sound premise. It's basically ""Johnny Reb in outer space"". It could be interesting to follow the losers of a futuristic conflict while they struggle to cope after a war. Unfortunately, Whedon phones it in, giving the characters hick accents, pump-action repeater rifles, six-shooters, leather belts and boots, and having them ride horses and rob freight trains, all set to country-western background music. This would have been great if it had been ""rebels as they would be in the future,"" but instead we get ""rebels from the 1850s artificially pasted into the future.""The only reason I give this series 2 stars: every actor here does a good job, and the production, visuals and staging are great. If these same actors and engineers had been given a decent story world and decent writing, I would have been a devoted fan."
1,3 of 4 DVDs would not play,DVDs have some kind of problem as only 1 would play. Would love to watch as I enjoyed the series when on TV. Too bad....
1,Among the most boring SF show ever seen,"This is one of the most boring sci-fi shows I have ever seen; I couldn't even get through the 1st show. Not since ""Starship Troopers"" have I seen anything this bad."
5,I can't believe it! Cancelled! I am waiting for someone to wake me up from this nighmare!,"I watched this Show this year only and it was a gift from my friend. He didnt tell me anything about it. I watched the show and it was brilliant. After i got attached to it I discovered that it was canceled! I thought I was dreaming! What could they need more in a show to succeed? I think they should reconsider, even after 6 years.. this show will bring FOX a fortune!"
5,Super Series!!!,"Quirky, fun, futuristic and a touch of the old west! I loved this series!! This is a prelude to the new movie Serenity and you really should see these DVDs to get a full background on the characters. Definately good entertainment!"
3,All there but....,"Just like the title says, all of the episodes are there but they put very little work into the package. The menus are very amateurish. You have to refer to the outer packaging to determine the episodes correct order.The bonus features are well done."
2,Can't win 'em all,"This is the first episode of this terrific series that's a real stinker.It was never broadcast so I hadn't seen it before. I had a tuff time making it thru, tho Frederic Lane(aka US Marshal Edward Mars from Lost)always makes a convincing villain."
2,Unable to get a replacement.,"My Blu Ray case arrived broken down the side of case. Where the case be ds is was broken all the way down. You can't open my case without it dropping all of the discs out. I looked into getting a replacement, but I'd only get my money back and have to repurchase the product. It would have been about $10 more. I love the show and am just keeping it with the case broken. I just wish I could have exchanged my product is all."
5,Firefly -- the best storytelling ever!,"Have you ever sat down to watch a movie expecting to be entertained, and instead found yourself deeply moved, even addicted? This is it. Firefly is a story about integrity, loyalty, and meaning in a harsh and meaningless universe. But it's also about laughter and love. Great stuff. The best."
5,Simply Amazing!,"This series, along with the movie Serenity is simply amazing. Highly recommend to anybody who enjoys Science Fiction, or great stories."
5,Another great series.....that was canceled!,"Even though this was canceled, it is finished well with the Serenity movie. I highly recommend watching this, take a weekend off and watch it all the way through, including the movie, it is well worth your time!!"
5,Nice!,"brand new, still packaged, loving this item in my household. not easily found, but knew I would find it on Amazon. Great price for this product, received quickly as well."
4,Great show--slow menu?,"Firefly is a great scifi series that sadly only lasted one season. The thing that really makes this show is the great characterization that Joss Weadon seems to put into everything he works on--from TV to comics.I greatly enjoyed this series. The DVDs, cases, and box are standard. They get the job done, and are what I'd expect for any DVDs, really. The thing that gets me is the enormous load times I have on the menus. It might just be my DVD player, but it will load the background and do some animations, stop for a second, then load some foreground animation of the actual episode, and then load the menu's text. It's not a huge issue, but it's kind of annoying to have to wait.I also would have liked an option to 'Play All'. But that's very minor.Over all, this is a great set to buy. Especially for the sale price of $16.99. Get it while you can!"
1,"Firefly, the series","Started streaming this about 8 months ago, loved it. When I started watching it there wasn't any CC. Surprised to find that Amazon actually went back and encoded it with CC. Much better now, when you are almost deaf it's frustrating not knowing what the dialogue is. I bought the series DVDs, and they are great, but still stream now that CC has been enabled. Easier than messing with the DVD.Great series, superb acting. If you like Sci-fi, you'll like this.Don't know why it appears as 1 star, this is a five star show."
3,Love the show but product was not what I expected,"I love Firefly and I was extremely excited to buy this product when it was on sale on Amazon. Based on the images, I was expecting the four disc set with individual cases in a cardboard slipcase. Instead, I received the four discs in the single case... which is what I already own and was planning to give to a friend after I got myself an ""upgrade."" Don't get me wrong, it's a great show and I would give five stars if I were rating the show itself, but the image led me to believe that the ""4-Disc Version"" was the default version being sold and was not what I got."
5,Buy this DVD! You will NOT regret it!,"I have never purchased a DVD set of a TV show before. I don't really watch many TV programs, but this show is the best TV show I have ever seen. The dialogue is better than any TV show, book, or movie I have ever seen. It is funny, bitter, heartwarming and crushing all at the same time. If I were an actor I would have paid Joss Whedon to let me say his words. My son also wants everyone to know that the music is great. :) Anyway, you should buy this set. It doesn't matter if you like sci-fi or not, if you like westerns or not, it's not about that. It's about the journey of these amazing characters that Joss created. Here's hoping the movie execs take notice and bring this story to the big screen."
3,Good Series Bad Blu-Ray,"Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]Firefly still is a amazing series. Even if its only 14 episodes. However, I was disappointed with the blu-ray version. I don't know if it was the remastering but all the episodes looked uneven, some scenes were high quality and others were grainy. Give me one or the other, not both mashed together. Its not a high-quality blu-ray copy and I wish they spent more time making it look better. In some scenes the blu-ray copy goes extremely bright and you can't see what's going on. As for the blu-ray special features, there are hardly any. Although the Lunch with Joss Whedon is a good addition, it doesn't constitute selling a whole new box set. I would rather stick with the DVD's, they look better. What should of happened is a high-quality blu-ray set with tons of special features, maybe a new episode. However, firefly is still a amazing series and although the blu-ray part should score a 1, firefly is a 5 and brings it up to a 3."
3,stick with the dvd,"Firefly is a superb science fiction series, so I definately recommend it. The quality of the Blu-Ray edition is disappointing, though."
5,Best Series EVER,Just read the title......Then watch the series......and scratch your head....and wonder why it was ever canceled.
5,addictive!!,"best series i've seen in a LONG time...i am a joss whedon fan, but this series was genius...i bet fox is kicking themselves over their stupid cancellation of this superb show...the characterization and their development is amazing, the casting is perfect, and the series is SO rewatchable!!! i am STILL addicted to the show!! a must have for ANY dvd collection!"
4,More- is there More?,"This series is one of my sister and my favaorites. We love the space/age wild west integration. However, somerwhere in my pea brain I remember another chapter where they go to a planet, where everyone has been killed, the crazed killing Reevers come back and River does her thing. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? How can I find this episode?"
5,one of tv's overlooked gems,"in my opinion this is one of the best shows ever on tv. science fiction meets western. a great cast and good story lines about a crew on a small independant freighter who take on some passengers to help pay the bills and the fun commences.the show was cancelled before the first season finished airing.i dont know if it was put up against stiff competition or a bad time slot,but the show definately deserved better.you cant go wrong buying this.dont forget to get the movie ""serenity"" which was made after the series was cancelled and ties up some of the loose pieces"
5,A Must Own!,"I missed most of the series when it originally aired (thanks to Fox). What I saw I enjoyed, even though it took me a little time to get over my predudiced view of Nathan Fillion as only being a comic actor in ""Two Guys and a Girl"" (formerly ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place"") where he played the third guy... Funny, but a heroic type? Yes!!!! He is a great actor! In an ensemble cast of nine he is the lead and he pulls it off!The scripts are stellar. Buy it and the movie ""Serenity"" that was filmed after the show was cancelled. (What show has that kind of fan base?) You won't be sorry!"
4,Enjoyed the Cowboys in Space,"For years our son and grandson have talked about ""Firefly,"" which was a TV series we somehow managed to miss. But then I discovered Nathan Fillion on ""Castle"" and totally LOVED him, so I thought it would be fun to go back to the ""Firefly"" series and see him in action there. Mr. Fillion has certainly grown as an actor from his ""cowboys in space"" series, bringing his quirky humor and pursed-lips smile to a modern-day police drama, but also showing more depth in character creation than ""Firefly."" My husband and I took a few nights to watch through the entire ""Firefly"" series -- especially enjoyed seeing the current TV series ""V""'s evil queen mother ""Anna,"" who is portrayed by intriguing actor Morena Baccarin, but then was the ""pretty young hooker with the heart of gold"" -- chuckling frequently, dreading the nasty creatures who were formerly humans, and understanding why this short-lived TV series has remained a favorite today."
5,Simply amazing,Firefly is a show that can grow on just about anyone immediately. This Blu-ray also looks very good. A great investment!
5,What more can I say .....,Nothing that hasn't already been said.Great show and I'm sorry its gone.FOX please bring FIREFLY back!!
5,Why wait?,"I purchased Firefly over a year ago. The box is frayed on the edges with tape holding one side. I have a list in my desk of all the co workers who ""borrowed it"". So far, it totals over 15 people.If you like the original Star Trek because of the action, this maybe a series for you.If you were always curious what would happen if someone ran a brothel out of a starship, this may be a series for you."
5,Love this series,"This series is great. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure, good interaction in a cast, has a good sense of humor. Who knew the wild west could blend with outer space?!"
5,Best SciFi Western,"I'm not sure how I missed this when it was on TV. Probably why it was cancelled. But, this is an enjoyable show. The characters are interesting and the storylines are all fresh. I count this as a great find and highly recommend it."
5,firefly-Joss Whedon's masterpiece,"The best scifi I've seen! Joss Whedon's use of humor is is perfect. The best writing anywhere. He develops every character slowly and carefully, giving you a little bits and peaces over the whole series. By the end you begin to know and feel for these rebels fighting the lost cause. I loved this series. I want more. Everyone I know who has watched this series love it. I give firefly my top recommendation."
5,Not your typical TV show,"I am not a ""typical"" TV viewer. In fact, I usually don't even remember when a show is on, let alone follow it regularly. However, when I stumbled upon the TV series ""Firefly"" I was enthralled by the blend of sci fi, western and intelligent story lines, and began watching the show avidly. To my dismay, the show was cancelled 5 episodes later. Since purchasing the DVD set and watching the series in its entirety, I have concluded it is one of the most original, witty and intelligent shows produced. Many reviews will detail plots, characters, etc., so I will not try to copy what has already been said. What I will say is that every character is well written, well played and someone who will remain in your mind long after you have finished watching the show. There is not a bad episode in the bunch. What a pity it was cancelled before people had a chance to see what was being offered. Buy the set - you won't be disappointed!"
4,Joss Wheadon...the early years,Love this series...too bad it was cancelled.Plenty of good acting and great comic lines. The series arrived fast and in great shape.
5,Great show,"I cannot fathom why Fox would have canceled this show, perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time. Regardless, this is one of the most unique science fiction shows in the history of entertainment, and it had so much to offer. My only hope is that they decide to strike production back up sometime soon. If you like sci-fi, you'll like this, if you like westerns, you'll like this, if you like drama, action, comedy, you'll like this, it's a perfectly rounded show and I think the reviews can speak to that!"
5,nice DVD set,It's nice to see that so much care went into making this a great DVD set of a wonderful show. I wish I could say the same of all my favorite shows on DVD. Kudos to all involved!
5,A Shooting Star of a Sci-Fi series,"I never heard of this series until it came out on DVD and was recommended by Netflix... I rented the first dvd and after watching it I cancelled the rest and promptly bought the series. It is second only to Space Above and Beyond for quality writing and characterization. I LOVED this show... I wish TV executives would encourage this type of Sci-Fi instead of the brainless crap they usually push on us. Expand you mind, buy this DVD Set for your self, then buy it for all of your friends"
5,Serenity at its best,"Loved the series, and loved seeing it in my home again! I had forgotten some of the details, so it was like watching it for the first time again...perfect!"
5,Firefly - Complete series,"At the risk of sounding cliche, I will start by saying that I consider most television programs to be of excrement 'quality'. Once in a while comes a show that makes it worthwhile to have purchased a box and justifies spending precious minutes staring at moving images. 'Firefly' is one such program. The setting, while not completely new, is very interesting (think post civil war America transferred into space). Characters are treated with depth and always show new facets of their persona. Plots are a very unique mix of western movies and space operas, which will probably please fans of both 'genres'. The fact that the show was cancelled is a testimony to the fact that television programs do not last due to their quality but rather live or die by the whim of managers for whom money is the ONLY bottom line. Buy this show and enjoy every second of it, then go online and participate in the effort to revive it."
5,Great Show! Need more like this one!,"Firefly was a great Sci-Fi show, what else can I say. In a time when Star Trek was getting too caught up in trying to stick to thinly stretched and P.C. ridden world it was good to see something fresh and new. Firefly was a truly original series and Fox made a big mistake in pulling it off of the air. For a while I was hopeful that maybe the Sci-Fi channel might pick up the rights and start to make new episodes but I guess the movie that is coming out will have to suffice. I highly recommend the DVD's for anyone that enjoys good science fiction."
5,I LOVE this show!,"Firefly was a show in a class of it's own. Part sci-fi, part western. Comedy, action, drama, naked Nathan Fillion. Best writing ever! Firefly had it all.Too big for tv, SERENITY will be gracing movie screens in just two weeks. I've been lucky enough to see the unfinished version twice and it's amazing. Firefly fans will love it. If you haven't seen the series, catch it quick before seeing the movie. Although you don't need the history, the emotional connection to the characters will really enhance the movie for you."
5,I'd give it 6 stars if I could,"Put simply, Firefly is one of the best television shows ever.The fact that it was taken away so quickly does not take away from its brilliance. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch the first couple of episodes. I guarantee that you'll end up watching the whole series.In a nutshell: great writing, great acting, great music, pretty much great everything...great show."
5,Tragic loss of creative SciFi,"Once again Fox shows it's ignorance for true creative TV entertainment by cancelling ""Firefly"". It's not a surprise that they'll never be an A list entertainment company. It is the reason Fox hasn't made my top ten channels to watch. As to Faux News? I find them just as nauseating as most conservative radio and TV that dances around or ignores the truth for pure sensationalism."
3,"Skip The Blu-Ray version, the standard DVD set is just fine.","Although I love the show, the Blu-Ray release stinks. They didn't improve the picture quality much at all so you might as well stick with the DVD set if you have it. They did remix the sound to DTS but it's hardly worth $60.00. Another Fox Blu-Ray failure if you ask me."
5,The Best show on TV ever !!!,"The first episode was a bit slow.But, then it picked up the pace and oh what a joy to watch !!!They should bring it back to national TV ASAP."
2,I honestly don't understand it...,"People rave about Firefly - it's almost like it's formed its own religion. But personally, I don't understand it. The story is mediocre, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired, and the acting was nowhere near the actors' ability.The first episode is available on Hulu right now. I would suggest watching it before buying to decide whether you'll actually like it.I don't expect many people who are actually looking for good information to actually see this, though... I'm sure tons of Firefly fans will have ranked this as unhelpful first..."
3,Good deal but overrated,At this price this set is a great deal. The series is interesting and entertaining. It is also very violent. The story line does not compare with B5 though.
5,Great Storytelling. Fantastic DVD.,"I never watched this series while it was briefly on television but heard some buzz about the DVD on the web so I bought it. It is well-cast, well-written, adult-oriented, and compelling. I found it better than most anything I have seen on television. My girlfriend, who hates science fiction, started watching the premire episode with me and was hooked as well. You can tell that, for creator Joss Whedon, this was a labor of love. I am simply amazed that Fox didn't even let the series complete its first season. Rumor has it that Firefly has been green-lighted as a movie now as well so hopefully someone will pick it up and the series will fly again. The promising, and chilling, story-arcs started in these 14 episodes need to be completed. Great storytelling!"
1,Missing Disc,"My 4 DVD set came without disc 3 instead there were 2 disc 4's. Great show, but missing disc 3 I was seriously dissapointed. When I finally had time to view this and relize the missing disc Amazon said my ""return period"" had expired and if I return it I only get partial refund. I would prefer an exchange with all 4 discs."
2,Violent and sexually racy,"Good story line, super special effects and great acting but too much sex and violence for me."
1,Missed out but refuse to get gouged,"I feel that I missed out on this series back when it originally aired, but I refuse to pay $31.99 for just the first season. For an old series, that price out to get you the full run and then some.*My rating is for the Instant Video Product offered, not the show itself."
3,Should have been better but for self indulgent producing.,"Firefly is well cast and has an interesting premise,so why doesn't it quite work.Well,for one thing this space show has country and western music on the soundtrack instead of the traditional classical music. This does not work and spoils the show.Another rather silly thing is that they have white and black people cursing in an asian language. They don't speak in an asian language,they just curse in it. How silly is that?The producer needs to learn that self indulgent producing equals TV sets turned off."
5,Firefly-the complete series,"This is a great series. We love it!It is set as a sci-fi western, complete with cattle rustling in a space ship. A group of ""honorable smugglers"" cruising the galaxy trying to make a living get caught in the drama of a young doctor trying to rescue his sister from the clutches of the ""Alliance"".Funny, but not a comedy. The acting is great. The characters are very real-- very believable. The script is well written with subtle humor (some a little dark). Plenty of drama and action.There are sexual references and some graphic violence, so may not be suitable for younger viewers."
5,Like a drunk to the bottle...,"...I can't stop coming back to this series. Every 6 months or so I see it beckoning me from the DVD shelf, and I hole up for a weekend and watch the whole thing. Every time the end is near I'm left wanting for more as well. I doubt there will ever be another series like it, and I'm sad for that."
5,What more is there to say?,"Can't say anything that the other 1500 people haven't. Just want to add my 5 star rating to the pot. One of the only things in this world that I recommend people just go and buy without ever seeing it, cause you'll want to buy it anyway so you may as well get it done now."
5,Great Show,"Great entertainment. Great cast and you will see some of your favorite actors in ""Castle"", ""Chuck"", and ""V"" cutting their teeth in this ""ORIGINAL"" ""Cowboys vs. Aliens"" prequel."
5,BROWNCOATS ARE SHINEY,"THIS SERIES IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I HAVE EVER SEEN, ENJOYED WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER, GET THE SERENITY DVD AND SEE WHAT ALL THE BROWNCOATS ARE ALL ABOUT BEST EVER"
5,Best sci fi series to date,"I hadn't heard of Firefly until my friend introduced it to me this year. After a few weeks of watching all of the episodes and Serenity, I am now obsessed with the show. I wish it hadn't been cancelled! For anyone who wants a funny, action packed series, Firefly is definitely the perfect choice!"
5,"Better 3rd time around, or 4th or",What can I add that hasn't already been said..I can't say how many times I have watched a FireFly episode or one of the movies.. They have a way of getting better after you see them a couple of times..There is quite a bit of subtle humor that can slip by unless you are tuned in to the characters. They are pretty funny in a sly way.. Jane cracks me up..Other than the last BSG series there is nothing in Sci-Fi that is better.
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!,Buy this NOW. This is one of the best TV shows ever made. Buy a few more and maybe it will come back on TV.
5,This DVD is wonderful.,Firefly was a treasure. I was stunned by FOX's decision to cancel it. I love this DVD. I would love to see a Firefly movie. But what I realy want is to have this show back on the air. I haven't watched FOX since this show was cancelled.
5,A good show cancelled way too soon.,"Whedon has a way of making strong characters and entertaining interaction between them. This, along with a space background that features more adventure than technology, makes the show unique, surprising and interesting.The western slant is a little too strong but if you can ignore the slightly ridiculous hick-speak the characters sometimes use you will find an outstanding show beneath that would have become a hit if it wasn't mismanaged by FOX.Try it, you'll like it."
5,Amazing Show,"One of the best shows I have ever seen, sad that it ended before it had a chance. I highly recommend this series to anyone."
4,"Great Series, Bad Blurays","Firefly is a fantastic series. This review is not about that. This review is about the absolutely terrible experience you will have with these Blurays. Not only are they slow to load but they don't remember your progress through episodes or allow you to access the disc menu while you are watching an episode. Seriously, there is no way to return to the menu without stopping playback. On a PS3 this forces you out of Bluray playback entirely and you must reload the disc, which is quite slow, to get back to the menu. Absurd. That there is no additional commentary and only a single 20 minute retrospective added to the Bluray beyond what came on the DVD set just adds insult to injury."
1,"Movie is great, but Unbox is uncooked","Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it."
1,Hyperbole,"I rarely write reviews but having seen almost universal RAVE reviews for this product, I bought the entire set and watched it all. All I have to say is MASSIVE LET DOWNAn overblown space melodrama. Westerns in space might be novel but not everything novel is worthwhile. As someone who loved Star Wars, Star Trek, ST TNG, and many classical westerns, I must say this series is a bitterly disappointing mishmash.Thank God the networks decided to pull the plug"
1,Fox did us all a favor,"Typical Whedon nonsense. The characters are shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom. What's missing from FireFly is genuine vision and seriousness--without which, the humor is just sophomoric smalltalk, so formulaic that you can set your watch by it."
1,Is this a joke?,"I absolutely cannot believe all the good reviews for this series. We barely made it through the 2 hour ""Serenity"" and 1/2 of ""The Train Job"" when we just could not stand it any longer. Shoddy acting, predictable writing, boring and cliche characters, laughable special effects,bizarre western/space theme... ugh. This was horrible. Seriously people if you want to watch great science fiction, Battlestar Galactica or old Farscape is the only way to go."
1,Beware the 5 star rating,"Thanks to the reviewer who let me know, ""The reason for huge numbers of five star reviews is because the die-hard fans have started a campaign to overwhelm the more realistic reviews of this show"". I watched two episodes and promptly removed this DVD from my wish list (only there because of the 5 star 'average'). It really is the most tedious, ill concieved, badly scripted and appalling piece of TV trash."
4,Firefly:The complete Series,"Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]I am only going to talk about one complaint about the packaging. The copy of the Blu-ray Firefly: The Complete Series that I received from Amazon had no Episode Guide in the case. Went to Fox Home Entertainment website, and asked them to send me a replacement copy of the missing Episode Guide. Absolute no response from Fox Home Entertainment. Contacted Amazon about the problem and was sent a replacement copy in 2 days, opened the replacement copy, guess what no Episode Guide again. Contacted both Fox Home Entertainment and Amazon customer service again, received a call right away from Amazon who was very sorry that Firefly: The Complete Series had been problematic, absolutely no response from Fox Home Entertainment. Received a discount from Amazon but that really did not solve the problem of the missing Episode Guide. Here is a link to see the missing Episode Guide [...] Hope this helps someone."
5,Experience the greatness of Whedon,"This is the show that introduced me to the greatness that is Joss Whedon. Don't let the idea of a ""Space Western"" turn you off - this show, with its great characters, witty dialog, and clever writing will take you for a fun and all-too short ride. The Blu-ray is not the best I own, but definitely worth having for this series. Nathan Fillion has become one of my favorite actors (see him now in ABC's Castle) and he is brilliant in the lead role as the captain of the Serenity."
5,Never watched it on TV,"I never watched it when it was on TV since it was bounced around so much. I only just now started watching it when a friend lent me one of the DVDs. I am a big fan of Deep Space 9 and it has taken a long time to find a new show that has drawn me in as much as DS9 did.This show is a refreshing change to SciFi TV. Everytime I anticipate a Star Trek ending, I don't receive one- which is good. It makes the show harder to predict.Reasons I like the show so much:1. It has great character development, the actors seem to really synch well with each other, and their backstory is actually interesting.2. I have always enjoyed video games from the space privateer genre. This show depicts that just right. I wish more modern video games like Freelancer had more of this feel.3. I like the off-world sets. THey feel like something out of blade runner. Every environment seems to make you want to go out and explore it."
5,A Wonderful,"Five hundred years from now, we have a crew of a star ship. They are not out to explore strange new worlds, not contact new civilizations. They are out to make a fast buck and are not finicky about legalities in doing so. Firefly was a kind of space western with situations and dialogue that were top notch. (Example: The Captain of the star ship retorts to one of his crew, ""I'm pissed off and heavily armed, so why are we having this conversation?""(...)It was too bad that the network put the series in a bad time slot, showed the episodes out of order, and then cancelled the series before it could find an audience. It may turn out to be the biggest programming blunder since NBC cancelled the first Star Trek.Highly recommended."
5,"A ""must-see"" series that you will love!","I bought this series only because it had so many wonderful reviews. I figured I'd hide it until Christmas for my 13 yr old. But when it arrived I was like a child at Christmas myself and I couldnt wait. I love westerns and I love sci-fi. Never knew I could have both. Awesome stories, fabulous characters that I feel like I know and a beautiful ship! Why someone cancelled this show I'll never understand!"
5,When you can't crawl...well you know the rest.,"I was one of this lost souls who used to say ""what is the big fuss with this Firefly series?"" When I started watching the series I was entertained but just that, but after I had watched all the episodes I felt like a dear friend had left me. Not many things do that to a human soul. This is a very special kind of show. If you havent seen the series you are missing out big time."
5,Firefly ... Best SciFi series that never was,"I'm not good at writing reviews for anything, and never really have in the past. However, I really need to write one about this series ... I can't for the life of me figure out why Fox cancelled this series. It had the making to be the absolute best SciFi series ever produced, far surpassing any Star Trek with it's depth, story, believability and addictiveness (and I'm a Trekkie). Because of the very odd way it was aired on Fox (not in order, pre-empted a number of times, 3 or 4 eps never aired) it was extremely difficult to follow it when it was new, but still managed to win awards and a cult following. The series is even more engaging since it can be watched in order on DVD -- get them, if you're a fan of ""smart SciFi"", you'll fall in love with this and end up wishing someone, somewhere would pick it back up and make a season 2 (HBO, Showtime, SciFi???)"
4,Firefly,"Firefly has a dry, sarcastic humour that appeals. The crew of 'bad' guys do whats right more often than not. i think the only reason they are bad guys is because to be law abiding citizens would have too many rules and checkpoints."
5,The brightest flames always burn out the fastest,"Firefly was one of the pinnacles of television for me. It was the product of group of people who truly believed in what they were doing. Great Writing, Great Directing, Great Acting...I look forward to any other avenues that this franchise might take... be it movies, books or anything. And I know that something will come becuse there is just to much unfinished.You can't take the sky from me."
5,An incredibly good show - and I don't even particularly like SF or Westerns...,"While navigating Amazon, I ended up on this series fortuitously, and was convinced by the raving reviews. Even though I do not particulalry like SF shows or Westerns, I decided to rent it. I was hooked after the first disk, and ended up buying it because I had to have it. Each episode has a nicely developed story, no repetitions, and the characters are all well fleshed out. I honestly cannot figure out why this show was pulled from TV (and I can see I am not alone in wondering...). There are so many unwatchable things out there, and this was clearly a superior product but, then, I hardly ever understand what goes on on TV... Anyway, if you don't know this series yet, I would strongly advise you to get it. Rent it first, if you don't want to commit. I bet you'll end up buying it anyway..."
3,Excellent TV series.....horrible blu-ray transfer,"First of all, the three stars are for the blu-ray transfer. The show itself deserves TEN stars! (and Mr. Murdoch has a reserved seat in h*** for canceling it!) Depending on the individual episodes, some of the conversion to blu-ray was ok. However some sections are grainy at best. Given the age of this series and the fact that it was made for TV and not the big screen, it's to be expected. If you can catch this set on sale, get it. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,I didn't get as much from this series as everyone else.,"At the risk of facing the wrath of what appears to be a VERY LARGE group of fans, I have to say I didn't like this show that much. I only watched the first disk as the second disk of the show was missing (seems I received a package with two disk 3s and was too late to return the set). If the show gets better, I apologise. But I felt I watched enough that I should have gotten hooked.Basically, what you've got here is a western. And, despite not liking westerns, I actually liked many westerns more than this show.Just one guy's opinion."
4,A good sci-fi series.,"I got it for ~$30. Since I found this series quite and entertaining sci-fi story, it worth the money (though it is not the best sci-fi ever)."
4,Great while it lasted...,The series had a great story line as well as a great cast and crew. It is a shame that it did not continue past the first season. I enjoyed both the series and the movie based upon it.
4,Good,Great packing. Great movie. We love it so much. Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
5,"Please, Sirs, I want some more","Alas, if only Firefly had lasted even one more season. This show has become a cult classic--and for good reason. Excellent writting, well-rounded characters and intriquing plots make this science fiction show a must see.If you enjoy Star Wars, Star Trek, or the Terminator franchise, give this a try."
5,Great buy,The series arrived quickly and at a great price. My husband and I have loved the series. Truly a great buy!!
4,Pretty Good but a bit too much violence,"Great Characters, Good Setting, Good Plots.There are a few of the episodes out of 14 that over did the violence, but without these, I would have no complaints. I'ld reconsider if you have kids under 10. Other than that it is a really great show."
1,did not receive,the company was out of stock and was going to be delayed further and I needed to cancel the item and will repurchase.
3,good,not an easy read but very useful for spirituality. Have to read this slowly and reflect for a while to be able to digest
4,I wanted to know more,I have barely begun this book but so far I am pleased. It is a little dry so it is going to take me some time to read.
3,"Great thoughts, horrible sentences...","I am still working on finishing this book, and I am by no means a slow reader. This book is incredibly deep in some of its insights. However the translation/editing of the book is a real problem. There are many run-on (and on and on) sentences that make following St. Teresa's line of thought difficult even for seasoned and educated readers. The content of the book itself is amazing but I would love to see an edited version that put the content into more comprehensible language and grammar structure."
3,"I love the ice packs, but this is wayyyy to small","I wish this were bigger. It would be perfect. I can fit a 4 oz avent bottle in it and a few little tupperwares of food or two 9 oz avent bottles (It will *barely* zip up because they are very wide.) The dimensions are really unreasonable to me. I can't imagine anyone being able to get much in this thing! I love the built in ice packs though, it is a really great invention and a sturdy, attractive product.I just found bigger ones on amazon but they arent advertised as baby items, they are just labeled ""fridge to go"" and are an inch or so wider. I should've bought one of those instead, due to the wide brand of bottle I chose."
3,Not big enough!,"I am at the weaning stage and bought this to put in some very small tubs plus a sippy cup, it just about fits that plus spoons and a bib, I wish it were deeper. Also I have another Fridge To Go case, in that one the freezer pack is removable but for this one, you have to put the whole tote in the freezer which takes up a little too much room in the freezer. Had I realised that before purchasing, I don't think I would have bought it."
5,Great Product,"I love this fridge pack! I use it all the time when we are going to be away from the house. I actually took it on an airplane trip (from California to Oklahoma) and at the time I was pumping, so I was able to pump, put the milk in this pack and it would get cold like it was in the refrigerator, lasted the entire day. I put it in the freezer in the hotel room, it stayed pretty frozen and was able to use it on our way back home. When we go out I bring it so I can put the leftover baby food in it to stay fresh until I can get it in a fridge. It held 3 - 6oz Playtex VentAire bottles (a little squished, but still fit), which is plenty for being out and about. If you had the fatter bottles I am sure it would only fit 2 of them. Basically it's like a mini portable fridge."
4,Works well,"This refridgerated portable cooler works well. It's a little smaller inside that I thought but fits 2 bottles of water, a frozen microwave entree, or similar. Great for daily lunch use for work."
1,Curve Case,"Although it says it's for a 9360, it's much too long, making it extremely difficult to get the phone out. Also, doesn't have magnet sensors which help with battery life. Waste of money - ended up buying a different one on ebay for $12.50 - that one works great. Would have returned it, but had already tossed the packaging ... silly me ..."
2,"He, robot","Seems like the prophet of cybernetics outsourced the writing of this history to a commodore 64. As I read this, I kept wondering if, perhaps, it was intended for youngsters? It's not bad, but quite light, and not up to Asimov's customary standard. I was puzzled that he dismissed Philip's assassination with a couple of sentences, that the internal conspiracies against Alexander aren't analyzed...Description of tactics and battles are simplistic. I suppose that when an author is so prolific and so eclectic, at some point, that limitations are unavoidable."
3,lovely chain,Chain is very delicaate and fine. So fine you can't see the chain on my arm. But worth the money. Will pass it on to my granddaughter/
5,GREAT CAMERA FOR IT'S PRICE!,I bought this simple camera for my mom and it's been great so far. Very easy to operate and takes very good pictures. I'm glad that I got it for her.
2,readers: exercise critical thinking when reading this book,"Some of the ""facts"" cited seem to need fact-checking, particularly in the sciences, where some facts are presented in an incomplete way.Also, in the quotes section, he quotes Al Gore as saying ""I invented the Internet.""In fact, Gore has NEVER said this. It's an easily checked fact, and I'm surprised the authors did NOT check this canard out. You can check out the debunking of the Al Gore ""fact"" (myth, really) at snopes dot com, or legal minds dot com or any number of other places where honest people took the time to find out the truth.This one mistake (coupled with other clumsily written ""facts"" in the book, make me wonder about the correctness of other ""facts"" they have published, and I haven't even gotten halfway through the book, yet.Reader--caveat emptor. And now I'm kinda sorry I bought the book."
1,"Fascinating, if the information were true","Everything in this book fascinating, if useless, and I really enjoyed it except for one overriding problem: THERE IS NO CONTEXT, NO DOCUMENTATION AND NO FOOTNOTES. Too many of the ""facts"" are unverifiable, urban legend or just plain wrong. Worse, they are mixed in with true bits, and it is impossible to know what's accurate and what's not without checking wikipedia for all the dubious stories. It is a good idea, but it would be a much better book if the authors had given a more complete story and listed their sources."
1,Useless - repleat with errors,This book is full or errors:Alka seltzer will make seagulls' stomachs explode.Duck's quack doesn't echo.Goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light.It's as if they just compiled everything interesting they'd ever heard with no fact-checking whatsoever.Very poor.
1,"Not only useless, but wrong","Full of half-truths, debunked urban legends and just really poor research. After reading the fifth or sixth innacurate semi-truth before hitting page 100, I gave up on the book for anything more than a bathroom reader."
2,Interesting Until....,"I thought the book was very interesting until I started to get to ""facts"" that I knew aren't true. There are also several times in the book that a fact would be listed such as ""the heaviest bird in the world is the kori bustard at an average of 31 pounds"" followed a few paragraphs later by ""the emu is the largest Australian bird at 7 feet"". Obviously that would make the emu larger than the kori bustard (I found that the kori bustard is the largest bird able to fly). There are several times the book does this and as one other reviewer stated, the authors needed to check their facts. Once I read ""facts"" that I knew weren't true, it made me doubt every other statement in the book and made me realize that I had wasted my time."
1,Two out of three is not enough.,"This is a Book and it is definitely Useless but look elsewhere if you want Information. A good quarter of the facts presented are debatable, apocryphal, or just plain wrong. Many are tired old chestnuts that have been repeatedly documented and debunked on web sites such as [...] or Wikipedia. And there is the crux of it: if this book were published in 1996 the authors could be excused for presenting tall tales and urban legends as facts. But it was published in 2006, by which time anyone with a brain, a web browser, and a modicum of initiative could and should do better."
2,Useless because it is wrong,"yep, as an avid reader of trivia, snopes, straight dope, etc., I encountered quite a few ""facts"" that are really just rumors but have been proven false or at least remain unproven. There are other strange things, such as Mongols being wiped out by a ""hurricane"" while invading Japan. Really? What were they doing on the Atlantic Ocean?The problem, of course, is all of the interesting things become less interesting when they only ""might"" be true."
1,wow does this have a lot of mistakes!,"Just like other reviewers here - I was really enjoying this book until I started coming across blatant errors. I was just skimming through the book and saw that Popeye was created in 1919 - me being a huge fan and somewhat of an historian on cartoons knew right off the bat he was created in 1929. Also on the subject of cartoons - the voice of Bugs Bunny, Mel Blanc, was NOT allergic to carrots. These are 2 facts just a few paragraphs from each other that I recognized as false. Upon further reading I began to realize this book should not make the claim that it contains useless knowledge, but rather that it contains stories the author once heard that might be partially true. If this is a best seller then I should have a crack at writing one of these."
1,Sloppy and Superficial,"There were numerous outright errors in this book, and much of the rest was unimpressive. While there were some items that looked interesting, they were overshadowed by the inaccuracies.The presentation was also extremely brief, providing little depth, color or context to the reputed facts. Altogether very unsatisfying."
2,...Useless Information,"The Book of Useless Information :A good idea for a gift when you have run out of ideas. It's easy tosend by mail, too."
3,"Fun, but errors","The book is fun to read but I have found at least a few errors in the book, as others have pointed out. That also leads me to wonder how many others there are. For instance, it lists the Monumental Axis in Brazil as the widest road and states that 160 cars could drive it side by side. If you look up a picture of the Monumental Axis it is just two regular roads with a large grassy median in between."
2,"Entertaining, but not necessarily factual","While this was an entertaining book that I read in a few nights, I wouldn't take everything in it as fact. The format of this book is basically just several one or two sentence ""facts"" per page with no sources to back it up. It's fine for entertainment value, but I wouldn't necessarily believe it all. I wonder how much of it is just ""urban legend"" repeated. For example, the origin of the ""F-word"" is explained as an abbreviation of ""Found Under Carnal Knowledge."" After doing an internet search, I found that this is just one version of several abbreviations that are considered to be urban legends by entymologists.If you're looking for ""useless"" trivia, I would recommend the Imponderables books by David Feldman. He takes questions from readers and researches them thoroughly, using and quoting multiple sources, so you can discuss it with your friends later without looking like an idiot. I can't say the same for this book."
4,People are to hard on this book,This is a good book. There are only a couple of mistakes in the book and most of them are just half-truths not lies. I think everyone is being to hard on it. It is interesting and fun to read.
2,Too Much Too Little,"I did not like this DVD at all. It requires too many props such as bricks, belts, towels, blankets, chairs, etc... Each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations. As a beginner I find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention. I feel it was a waste of money and don't recommend it."
2,disappointed,"I was also disappointed with this DVD, as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers. I think the title, ""Yoga for Beginners"" is misleading, as this DVD contains many advanced yoga routines. Also, on the back of the DVD it said it contained a ""Core Workout 20 Min."" but no such workout is actually on the DVD!I purchase the ""Pilates for Inflexible People"" at the same time as this DVD, and I much prefer it. Although, I wish I'd known that two of the workouts from the pilates DVD were on the yoga DVD before I bought them both."
4,I was surprised,"I was surprised to find that the item I purchased was advertised as new, but when I received the item found that it was in fact used. There were a couple of pages where the answers had been bubbled in on the pages. One of the pages was done in pencil so I was pretty much able to erase the answers so I can copy the pages. The other 2 pages, on the other hand, were marked in pen so I will not be able to copy these pages. Fortunately, the book was considerably cheaper than if I had purchased it from a store."
3,Good if you want general Stones news,"Right off the bat, why they included that horrible fake riff is something I'll never know. I can't stand to hear it. The only thing that I really like about this dvd set were the Taylor interviews. He was after all part of the group during the best line-up. Still, it's depressing not hearing Rolling Stones songs in a Rolling Stones documentary. The first to volumes are good. Then is kinda just gets boring. They had good concert footage but it still felt really incomplete without official songs. Hopefully someday we will get something for the Stones thats just as good as the Beatles Anthology. Set is good for newbies, keep away if you are a die-hard fan."
2,one for the fans only,"This 5 disc package is not authorised by the Stones and contains no Stones Music at all. Typical pay TV fodder, better off getting the excellent 12 X 5 documentary along with Bill Wymans book Rolling with the Stones. On bright moment is a copy of the rice bubble jingle as a bonus on the first disc. Lets hope ther is a DVD from latest tour."
3,Where is the music ??,...BR>The Stones do not play on it at all!!It has some good movie footage.....but where is the music?? ... I would only recommend buying it if the Stones played on it!!
1,Who Would Buy This?,"I was just about to buy this collection when a friend warned me off. I thought even though it was unathorized there would be some revelations - gossip even. But this is ... in the extreme. Nothing new here or original, and guess what - NO STONES MUSIC PERIOD. Who thought of producing a set on the greatest band in the world without the kick ... music included?? To make matters worse, some jerk thought it would be cool to get a guitar player to mimic Keef's classic riffs throughout - BAD IDEA. This box must have taken a day to throw together. Okay, so maybe getting hold of the guys would be tough, but why not get together some of the bands who have fallen under the spell of the Stones - GnR's, Aerosmith, Nugent, to name a few. Save your money and buy the recent remasters . If my friend hadn't warned be off, I'd be real ... now - nearly 50 bucks!!! GIVE ME A BREAK. There should be a law aginst putting stuff like this out ."
2,Not very good!,This collection is truly an amateur effort at putting together a retrospective look at the entire Stones history. I was aghast to see that no music was included. Don't bother with this one unless you collect everything Stones.
2,Just for die hard fans!,"This DVD-collection contains no music by the stones, no interviews of stones members, only their history illustrated by some footage. The only interesting thing about this is other artists talking about their experiences and feelings about the band we all love so much. But it's hardly worth the price."
1,Rolling Stones...,"Hey- Don't Know if this DVD Set rates One Star. I've only seen about 40 minutes of the 1st DVD and already I KNOW this is a weak DVD set. Before playing the DVD, the viewer knows something is wrong...when you read on the case-""This DVD is Neither Endorsed Nor Authorized By The Rolling Stones"". How can you make a Rolling Stones DVD Set Without Including any of their Music?...!!! All you here is the Same background music. Don't know if I will waste my time by watching the other DVD's. MY Recommendation- find the classic ""12 X 5"" Rolling Stones Videotape... OR watch a recent DVD by The Doors."
2,poor detailed maps,"The maps have an insufficient ground detail. Few days ago I've purchased an ""Arizona Atlas & Gazetteer"" by DeLorme, great detail, a long better than the other."
4,Great reference!,"We just returned from a week in Arizona, and this guide came in VERY handy! The only bad part was having to flip from page to page as we ventured, but this is much much better than a regular map!"
3,description did not include damage,"pages not all clean, spine damaged . expected more an acceptable condition not good. description did not include any damage. expected to be used not broken"
3,IS IT A BRATZ GIRL OR BOY?,"I MUST SAY THAT MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A BRATZ COLLECTOR AND OWNS ALL OF THE BRATZ DOLLS WAS EXCITED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT TWO NEW BRATZ BOYZ WERE SOON TO BE RELEASED EITAN AND KOBY. EITAN WAS AS HANDSOME AS EVER,HOWEVER, WHEN SHE RECEIVED KOBY SHE WAS A BIT DISSAPOINTED. KOBY S HAIR IS A BIT TOO LONG AND NOT STYLED TO DATE MAKING HIM LOOK MORE LIKE GREG BRADY FROM THE BRADY BUNCH.HIS FEATURES ARE A BIT TOO SOFT AND ON THE FEMIMINE SIDE. SHE PUT A BANDANA ON HIS HEAD AND COVERED HIS EYES WITH SUNGLASSES JUST TO MAKE HIM LOOK MORE LIKE A BOY."
5,Good watch to Buy,I received this watch very quickly. This watch looks stylish enough no one would guess it was made by casio!!! Very good looking watch...Stainless steel case and band.Mid sized not bulky.
3,Not a bad watch for the price,"After looking to replace a watch my wife bought me, I decided to buy this one. The watch face is nice, different from the usual black or white without looking childish or odd. I read other reviwers on how difficult it is to adjust the band size but I had no problem. I have a small wrist and had to remove 3 segments but now I think I will add 1 back as it feels just a bit too snug. The small dials are just a bit too small to read without glasses or good light. That is the only thing stopping me from giving the watch a better rating. But let's face it how many times do you really need to refer to your watch to find the day of the week or the date? That's why I don't want a watch with so many dials and stops, etc."
2,Casio watch,"As a wrist watch, I am dissatisfied with the metal band. It plucks hair underneath the band. The bright nickel two-tone effect band is good."
4,Very good looking watch,Very good looking watch. Can't tell this is the $30 watch. Happy with the product. Do not have to explain about the Casio duability.
4,great sport watch,"I purchased a Casio Men's multifunction analog bracelet watch from Amazon, this watch is better then the picture and description showed, I truley love this watch, it looks good and feels good to wear, I have had many complimants on my new watch and am glad I made this purchase."
3,Nice watch worth the money...,"Watch came in a timely manner, and a very handsome watch. When my husband opened it one of the little hands inside the little clock closest to the six was broken. Luckily the watch was intended for work use, and the price was right... If the hand wasn't broken I would rate this product 5 stars. I also hate returning things, and as my husband is an electricianit will get beat up anyway."
4,yeah,"Let me first say that the world of organ music that I have been exposed to is very, very small. I have played PLENTY of orchestral pieces, and PLENTY of solo concerti; but an organ concerto?? Never. I first heard the name Poulenc in symphony orchestra class, where my director said we were playing it. I ran out and got it (honestly, I went down the hall to the music library where I found this album...) but it is AMAZING! I did use it to look over my part, and observe more of the musical nuances, but the other stuff in it is amazing too! It's worth buying if you want to hear a broad spectrum of emotions... or if you just want mad-scientist sounding stuff."
4,Melodic and catchy,"Word of Mouth was the third album from the Mechanics and the beginning of the end concerning their US commercial success. Unfortunately grunge had arrived and pretty much killed melodic rock as a top 40 staple. ""Word of Mouth"" has some good tunes, especially the title track, ""Get Up"" and ""Everybody Gets a Second Chance"". One of the things I really liked about this record is the songs alternate between Paul Young and Paul Carrack as lead vocalist although Carrack has 6 songs and Young 4. This is probably the most consistent recording from the Mechanics and there are no surprises here. If you like melody driven A/C music this record is for you."
3,o.k. album,"Word of Mouth offers some good tracks. The title track ROCKS, as does 'Get Up'. Both are very good songs and are the best on the album. The rest of the album is good, but it seems to retread old territory. I would recommend their first album if you're new to this group."
4,In need of some Mechanical repair,"This was availible in the U.S. on Atlantic. It didn't do well here, especially since it was overshadowed by ""I Can't Dance"" later in the year. Not that bad, though."
2,Mechanics need a pit stop,"Mike Rutherford is in the unenviable and unavoidable position of being compared with his more successful colleagues from Genesis - Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel. This album does not help.Most of the material on the Mechanics' third album falls away after the encouraging opening track ""Get Up"".While there is plenty of slick pop throughout, most of the lyrics are a little flat. ""Get Up"", the title track, ""Stop Baby"" and ""Let's Pretend It Didn't Happen"" are the better moments.This is a disappointment because the Mechanics, formed in 1987, had shown promise."
2,i hate it,ok i hate this toy! when igot her out of the box annd started 2 play her head fell off!! i gave education 1 star cause it teaches girls 2 party and thats not good cause lots of girls look up 2 bratz
5,one of the best,the voice from that lady is realy one of the best I have heard in years.she make's the tears come in to my eyes.O so GOOD
5,Here's the Best-Here's My Heart,"I am a new fan of Zan Gardner. What an emotional, free-thinking, incredibly talented vocalist. She makes me FEEL something when she sings, she makes me want to sit up and listen. Very few Jazz vocalists have that talent, I dare you not to react in the most positive way to her CD, to the improvisation and heart it conveys. A gorgeous, sensuous voice. It is professional, with a killer band and they all weave the stories of the songs. I will be a fan of Zan Gardner forever, this woman is amazing! I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot about her, every bit of it great!"
3,NEVER GOT IT!!!!!,I find that it ASTOUNDING that I'm actually asked to write a review of a product that. A) I never got. and B) haven't been creditted for.THANKS AMAZON!
5,This book is awesome!!!,"I can't believe this book! I saw it at my school's co-op and I couldn't pass it up. I mean, how many books actually show you how to do a Jedi Mind Trick or take a bullet? For those who like the Worst-Case Scenario books or TV show, this is another great one to add to your collection!!!"
1,get them at the dollar store,Got this same exact glass at the local dollar store for $.50 a few months ago. May want to check there first.
3,a must have accessory,"I bought this due to my new camper shell could not be installed with the factory tail cap. part arrived in a very long box that had been folded in half. Part was damaged and did not fit well on my tailgate, used a hot air gun to mold back into shape and still does not fit correctly. if the plastic was a bit thicker and packaged in a sturdier box, I would have to give a 5 star rating."
4,Nice Castle,This is really nice and well made castle. My son is 2 yrs old so he hasn't quite played with it as much as I would like but I'm sure when he gets older he will love it.
4,encourages creative play,My grandson has enjoyed hours of play with this Melissa and Doug castle. The product is well made and durable. I also purchased the play set. The characters were not as detailed as I would have liked. I was able to find an agreeable price through Amazon.com. I would recommend.
5,Cool Castle,I did not know it had a trap door and the little sliding door too. My son really enjoys it! It has so many little places for the people to hide. Very cool!
5,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!,"We bought this Melissa and Doug castle for our 2 year old son for Christmas. This is such a great toy for a toddler / preschooler! He just love it. The castle is very sturdy and BIG! (It does fold up to half it's size) My son has not stopped playing with it for days. It is super cute and impressive to adults as well. My husbands (adult) friends all said they wish they had one when they were small. It has a bunch of hiding spots, rooms, stairs and nooks to put all his ""little guys"" in. A perfect toy for an active, imaginative two year old!"
4,quality toy,I felt this toy had a much better value than a plastic castle.Very please with this purchase. My granddaught was able to her Disney figurines with this toy.
5,Awesome fun,This castle is so much fun for my grandchildren and easy to fold up and store. We have had so much fun with this toy and I've ordered knights and dragons to go with it. We are learning about history with this toy as I read them stories as we play. I am not sure who is enjoying this more my grandchildren or me!!
5,perfect toy for creative play,"My youngest daughter (age 4) received the Melissa & Doug Folding Medieval Castle for her birthday a week ago. She and her 5 year old sister have played with it for hours on end! This is not just a ""boy toy."" It helps to purchase figurines to go with it, but alone, it's worth it's weight in gold!"
5,Great imaginative play!!!,I bought this for my son's 5th birthday and he and his friends (boys and girls) played with the castle all day. The kids were actually waiting to play with the castle over the commercial action figure toys that are marketed everywhere. This is a great imaginative toy for boys! The construction is durable as all Melissa and Doug toys are.
5,Perfect,This was exactly as described. Hours of fun! Imaginative play time for my 3 year old grandson. Really well designed and built
5,Excellent toy for families with several (and small) kids,"An excellent, durable toy without absurdity of ""disneyrized"" pink or ""eclipsized"" haunted castles - ideally suitable for families with several kids (has almost no parts which are dangerous to younger kids - except for a few sharp corners - but that's hard to avoid with almost any toy for older kids) where playing all at once with the same toy is on the agenda. It is very gender-neutral toy that can be shared by both girls and boys. We bought one for our own kids (we have a son and a daughter) years ago, and then went on to buy several more for friends' kids (in total of about 5 such castles over the years, in different places)."
4,"Good value, fun toy","My mother got this for my 3-year-old for Christmas, as he has an interest in castles, knights, etc. For the price, this castle is wonderful -- large, relatively sturdy, and great for inspiring imaginative play. And it goes great with the wood and cloth knights/royalty figures set (which my mother also purchased to go along with this). One star off because the wood splinters and chips a bit too easily and because the drawbridge mechanism is difficult for a young child. Otherwise, I'd recommend this toy highly."
5,Great Buy!,"My husband injured his elbow at work. I ordered two of the elbow supports and he really likes them. He wears both of them for support to work everyday. The elbow support really helps because he has to do a lot of lifting, the supports keeps him from injuring that same area. Thank you so much and thanks for the quick shipping."
2,Not enough elbow support,"I assumed this at first but thought I'd try them anyway. Because they are adjustable, they provide little support at the elbow. I purchased them to support my elbows during workouts. No matter how tight you make them, the elbow elastic does not support the elbow. The opening at the antecubital space (you can't see it in the picture because her elbow is not extended) causes pinching in that same area."
3,Inexpensive and comfortable--but didn't help much,"I had higher hopes for this product. After a couple of weeks of consistent use, I had little appreciable improvement in my tendonitis-like symptoms. It went on and off easily and was nicely adjustable, however."
4,Good Item. As Expected,"It's a good brace. I don't think I'd call it great. Like any brace, it will get a little uncomfortable after wearing for too long. It does seem to relieve the pain in my elbow, which is what I was hoping."
2,Does little for tennis elbow,"I bought this for tennis elbow. I would get the soreness in the elbow area, some clicking and pain with lateral types of movement. This brace is not very effective. What I found helped a lot was braces / supports which are specifically for tennis elbow versus something like this product which had generic support claims."
