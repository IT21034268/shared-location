4,rare,been looking for this dvd for awhile as i have not viewed as yet the service was first class looking forward to watching it
3,Overall good book to read,Gives a personal reveiw of major brands of tobacco that is something to use for reference. It is very similar to his other books with some added information. It would be a good starter for someone who wants to start smoking.
3,Typical Hacker publication,"Typical Hacker book here. Lots of useful info as long as you can sift through his very high opinion of himself. Makes good reading, but don't hesitate skipping the parts where he talks about how important he is to the industry..."
2,The Ultimate Pipe Book Regurgitated And Slightly Updated.,"Let me start off by saying that if you own a copy of the Ultimate Pipe Book by RCH, you don't need this book. It is essentially a word for word copy of it! Imagine my disappointment when reading this only to discover I had read it 20 years ago in the UBP. Only this time, there is a tobacco section with the authors nonsensical rating scale.That being said, if you don't own the Ultimate Pipe Book, this is worth the read. As other reviewers have stated, there is very good information to be found here, you just have to get past the authors ego and occassional inaccuracies. Mr. Hacker deserves credit for filling a void in the pipe smokers library some 25 years ago but to release this book under a new title is just ridiculous and shameful."
4,Christmas gift of music,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He says he enjoyed the music very much.
1,Not worth it,"I had looked forward to this and counted down the days to release. Much old material rehashed, inferior to the original recordings.Has Flogging Molly peaked? I think so."
5,It's nothing new but still very worth it,"In ""Whiskey On A Sunday,"" you get what the product description above so helpfully states. As far as what I think of the contents, I'll let those five stars above speak for me, although I'd make it 10 if I could. Flogging Molly is the best live band I know of and it seems that they're too talented to make anything not worth listening to over and over again, or, in the case of what the CD here has, acoustic or live when you already have the album version. The only reason not to get this is if you don't care about the musicians who make what you listen to."
3,Helpful resource,"This book is definitely geared toward Christian families, which was fine for me, but may not be for everyone. There are a lot of good points and helpful information on how to live with (not just survive) a spirited child. The stories of other children were reassuring that my husband and I were not alone, and the first half of the book was very helpful with some strategies on redirecting situations or avoiding blow ups all together. After a while, it did start to get redundant. The main premis is to find the true source of the child's actions and focus teaching the child how to cope with them instead of reacting to the child himself.Overall it was helpful, but not ground breaking reading or anything."
5,memorable tale of a mother's secret love story,"I finished this book more than six months ago and the characters are just as fresh in my mind. I loved the narratives slow reveal of bits and pieces of family stories regarding romance/secrets and one generation caring for the next in the best way they know how. The images Stefaniak created regarding the village in the ""old country"" and immigration experience here in Milwaukee were memorable. I loved the music, the flowers and love that she portayed here."
3,poor hardware,"My husband put this together and even he found it to be of poor quality. The scooter is great and our daughter loves it. However, my husband had to go to Home Depot to get another nut and bolt because the originals stripped upon tightening the handle down. This is probably why other customers had problems with this scooter. We looked at this scooter first in the stores. It was perfect there. But we had to put it together which is fine if the hardware was of good quality. We did buy it through Amazon because the price was cheaper. These items should be of high quality especially for the original price someone would pay for it. The parts should be inspected for safety and quality before packaging."
2,Falls Apart,We purchased this toy for our daughter and it falls apart everytime she uses it. It will not stay together. May be worth it to spend more on a better quality product even though this one is very cute and princess themed.
2,Lemon?,"I purchased this scooter online because my daughter really wanted it for christmas and the stores were empty. Unfortunately I waited until 1 day before Christmas to put it together. The frame was welded together crooked that it barely stood up on it's own. I'm having it replaced, so I'm really hoping that the second one is straight. I will have to post a new review on scooter #2."
5,"Pricess 6"" scooter review","Our 4, almost 5 year old loves anything Princess. The scooter was a big hit. She rides it almost every day."
2,"Talk, talk, and yet more talk.","Cherryh has written some magnificent space epics, but this wasn't one of them. I had my hopes up; with a title like ""Hellburner,"" and set in the Pell universe, how could it go wrong? Alas, there was no action, just a great deal of talking among characters I didn't like about bureaucratic turf wars (and I can get as much of that as I want just by going to work in the morning). Perhaps I would have enjoyed it had I read ""Heavy Time"" first, but if I'd been keeping a running journal of my reactions, it might have read thus (paraphrasing an old Matt Groenig cartoon):Page 1: Oh boy - something's going to happen!Page 50: When is something going to happen?Page 100: Nothing's happening.Page 150: Nothing's still happening.Page 200: Maybe something will happen in a different book.So I cut my losses and gave up at the halfway point."
2,Blah Blah Blah,"This is the most boring book I have ever read. For well over one hundred pages I have read nothing but endless military jargon and page filling conversations that go nowehere. There is no action and probably won't be for some time judging by the snail's pace this book has taken so far. I doubt if I'll bother completing this book. Maybe I'll give the author a second chance and read one of the other books such as Cyteen or Downbelow Station, but this book is definitely dry. Maybe I'll keep the book for when I have insomnia."
3,wrong artists,"I have been haggling with AMAZON for the past month about their advertising this CD with Valery Gergiev and the Orchestra from St. Petersburg. They refuse to correct their listing. There are THREE musicians on the recording. THREE. Flute, harpsichord, and violin. THREE. I have no complaint about the seller or HIS service."
2,Risky Buy,"My supports arrived with no visable damage to the box but when I opened one up, the small plastic joint for the hand was broken off. I could use a good support of this type but this one is a bit fragil."
3,"Idea is great, Design is cheap","I have 4 of these units, which so far I've mainly used for enclosing working areas... Even that, I always seem to have to fight with these devices... The rubber legs will pop off or the handles will stick or the locking pin will engage as I'm trying to extend the pole (Frustrating)... Not a terrible product, but when time is money the last thing you want to do is have to spend more time than needed just trying to set these jacks up. Most all of the plastic components are already showing signs of breakage... I think it will be just a matter of a little more usage before they will no longer work at all.."
2,Flimsy,"I bought a pair for a recent home, crown molding project. The first board went great but then the misadventures began. Both supports eventually fell over a few times (not hard) and that caused both to jamb--meaning no up or down motion. I called the FastCap folks (GREAT people by the way--amazing service) and they sent me replacement parts. That only worked so-so...items still jamb up.When they work, they work great. My experience is that they are way too flimsy because fall overs happen--especially when you are by yourself up on a ladder!"
3,"Okay, but minimum 59 inches?","These seem okay. There was some minor damage on the plastic of one of them when I got it. Is 59 inches the standard height of the bottom of cabinets? I incorrectly made the assumption that these would be the perfect size. My kitchen has an 8 ft ceiling and I was just replacing the old cabinets, so I wanted to hang them at the same height. They seem like normal cabinet height, but the jacks are too long."
1,Poor Design,"If you have cabinets which are less than 5', the tool is useless as the majority of upper cabinets start at 54""."
4,Details lacking,"For some reason, they do not want to provide many details about this product. So I'll fill in the blanks. The maximum weight limit is 70 pounds. The blue body is made out of steel. The top and bottom plates, and the squeeze handle are made out of plastic. There is a non-marring rubber pad on both the top and bottom plates. The plates swivel on a plastic ball joint. The total shipping weight is 13 pounds. Made in China. Overall I'm quite happy with it. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I'm not sure how long the plastic ball joints are going to last. Time will tell."
4,Great for crown molding,"I just used a pair to install crown molding. Now, I'm wondering how I would have done the job without these handy helpers. Very impressive! I'm not concerned about the strenght of these supports for crown molding. Still, I would not put much load on them fully extended - maybe 10 pounds. Fully retracted, they are quite strong. There were no instructions, cautions, or specifications packed in the shipping box. I thought this to be very odd as manufacturers are pretty cautious about misuse of their products.You can easily extend the supports to the proper length as you would with a pipe clamp and then chinch it tight with the hand hand grip. The grip and ball joints at the top and bottom are made of plastic and would appear to be easy to break. If it does, the support becomes useless. This concern is why I rated it with 4 stars. However, I've dropped mine on hard tile twice now and have not broken anything yet."
5,Great for Crown molding,I just finished installing 6 inch by 16 ft. lengths of crown molding completely throughout a house I am building. Working by myself is a pleasure and the 3rd hand support system made this job not only possible to do by my self but much easier then I ever expected. The best helpmate I have ever purchased besides a pannel lift for sheetrock.
2,3rd hand? try 0.2 of a hand...,"What a dissapointment. Bought 2 of these starting a remodeling project because we thought they would come in really handy for a variety of tasks. One broke on the first try jacking up a <40lb 2x8 to the ceiling (advertises 70lbs). The handle is really flimsy, the swiveling top plate doesn't have enough friction to not swivel when you don't want it to.I guess if you want to use it as a tent pole it might work. Given the cost, I was hoping it would be more useful...and not break!!!I'd prefer 2 hands I know will work than any number of these ""3rd"" hands."
1,Horrible Buy,"I used one of these worthless things once. It was used to hold up one end of a single 2x6 and it was unable to do that. Besides being incredibly cheaply made, they are unable to do the job. I just can't figure out what anyone else used them for."
4,Very helpful tool,"I was in need of some help applying sheet rock in my garage. Using the ""third hand"" along with a 2 x 4 T-square I was able to install 4 x 8 sheets with one other person and myself. The hand grip clamp extension was very useful."
5,Excellent product and customer support,"I've owned these for 3-4 years and use them frequently. It's a great product and once you own it, you'll find all kinds of uses for it. Several months ago, I broke the knob on one of them. I tried to find a replacement at the hardware store but wasn't able to so I sent an email to FastCap asking if I could purchase a replacement knob. Four days later, a replacement knob was delivered to my home at no charge. I really appreciate a company that stands behind its product and offers excellent customer service and support. I put FastCap in that category."
5,Many Uses,"FastCap's 3rd Hands are not only great for holdinh up moldings and such as designed, I use them nearly every day in my home shop.I am a woodworking author and consultant. My shop doubles as a studio where I shoot still phots and video of woodworking products and techniques for articles, blogs, demos and my website.My 3rd Hands are used to hold up my backdrop! I can position them anywhere in my shop quickly and easily, then hang my neutral backdrop to photograph in front of. It only takes seconds to set them where needed!Ralph Bagnall [...]"
1,NEVER RECEIVED BOOK,"Never received book and when i finally did, the cover was missing. A disappointment for such a high price."
1,smashed,"I expect this product is very good, but it comes in a glass bottle. It was sent via the U.S.P.S. and arrived smashed, even tho it was bubble wrapped and in a box withseveral other bubble wrapped items."
2,Disappointing,"This set was disappointing, would have been, even if it wasn't presented as the best... would hate to see the worst."
2,ukulele kit,The main reason for ordering this kit was to get dimensions to make my own. I did assemble the kit which went to gether well and looked good but was virtually impossible to play.The hardware was junk as well as the strings. After much research... you can buy a built uke ready to play that actually sounds good for about [...] bucks. Pass on this one unless you want to use it for decoration.
3,FUN FOR THE AMATURE,"FUN COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES, TO MAKE SOMETHING YOURSELF IS VERY SATISFYING. BONUS IT WONT JUST SIT ON THE SHELF. IT'S MUSIC TO YOUR EARS, AS SOON AS YOU TUNE IT..."
4,Informative and inspirational!,"The Frank Serpico biography had been on my ""to read"" list for a while, but I just wasn't getting around to it. My husband finally read the biography and was giving me the highlights so I finally just decided to save myself a few hours and buy the movie! We both liked it, thought it was well made and my husband thought it covered the points brought up in the biography as well. It's inspiring to hear a story of a ""little guy"" standing up to corruption, and we liked hearing about what Mr. Serpico has been up to since his retirement."
3,"Strangely tired, affectless Brahms","I am a geat lover of both Brahms serenades, so pickedup the Tilson Thomas recordings of both with great anticipaiton. All I can say is that he has surprisingly little feeling for Brahms, and both CDs went to the bottom of my list. Tempos lack any kind of joy or brio, and overall there is a sense that opportunities for pointed accents and luyrical flights are being missed right and left."
3,"the serenade is perhaps full of elegance, but sounds boring to me","the serenade is perhaps full of elegance, but sounds boring to me. The Tragic ouverture I like most. Good record."
3,Life Everlasting,"The Second book 'Life Everlasting' picks up where 'Life Support' ended, however, there's not much story to tell. When you get to the end of this second book you'll be glad there is not a third installment!"
4,Life Everlasting,"I enjoyed this book so much! As part of a series, I completed my set from Amazon and as usual their great sellers. I have never been disappointed with purchasing my books from the sellers and will continue."
1,Not Worth the Read,This book drags on and on with the story not really developing. After reading the whole book the ending is pushed into four pages. Terrible. I have never read this author before and I doubt I will again. I was disappointed and would not have finished the book if not for traveling and needing something to read on the airplane.
5,I couldn't stop reading...,"...which is not unusual for a Whitlow mystery. ""Life Everlasting"" is a sequel to his equally engaging ""Life Support"". Whitlow is able to take a reader and introduce or reintroduce him to a list of characters who become fleshed out with distinct personalities and experiences that are far from predictable. If the reader has an interest in either music or medicine he will be especially intrigued by the depth of insight into the mysteries of healing both soul and body. For those interested in romance, your will find it here as well. I recommend you start the book when you have a long, unintereupted weekend or break so you won't have to stay up several nights reading until your eye lids refuse to stay open, as happenned with me. It is time well spent!"
5,Life Everlasting,"This is the first Robert Whitlow book that I have ever read. It will not be my last. At first I thought it was going to be a hard read, but then it began to draw me into the story. I love the main character,Alexia. She is learning as a new Christian that God does really work in mysterious ways sometimes.Baxter's story is miraculous. He has been in a coma and God is using the music of a young minister to bring him back. His wife and brother both wanted him to stay in the coma or die. They did not want him to wake up and reveal their secrets. His father wants him to live, but for his own selfish reasons.I love a good mystery and I love the way everything comes together in this book. I was dissappointed at first because I thought the author was revealing who was responsible at the very beginning, but as you continue to read you are drawn into a much deeper mystery.Life Everlasting was an awesome read!"
5,The benefits of openess and flexibility,"My kids and I both love this book. The art is pretty without being distracting. Sid is drawn very expressively, and as a real character, without being a talking animal. The message of sharing, openess, and flexibility are important and come in handy in our lives."
5,I really enjoy Celtic music,This is easily one of the better celtic music CDs. None of the big flashy artistic ego trips here. You can tell that Mr. Dale and Ms. Barnes are regular folk who really enjoy what they can do with the talents given them. That's what good music is all about. They care and it comes thru in their music. Buy it and hear for yourself.
3,Confusing,"Watching this movie is like going to work. It just takes too much effort to be comfortable/enjoyable. Part of this is undoubtably my own personal reaction to times and events that, perhaps, hit entirely too close to (my) reality. I have never reacted to anything the way I react to watching or thinking about this movie. I guess that the most honest thing I can say is that the people that did this movie must have been very, very good to have managed to kick me in the gut that hard! Watch this, maybe it will make you too to think.Metalsmith"
1,movie,"I love Kevin Bacon, but I hated this movie. I tried fast forwarding to see if it got better...but it did not."
2,not worth it,"This game was pathetically easy. Solving the puzzles involves, for the most part, finding all the objects and the areas where you need to use them - it's not really that hard to figure out which objects you need to use and where you need to use them. The voice acting wasn't really that great, and the story was only mildly interesting. The only reason this game doesn't get a one is because I've played adventure games that are actually worse than this one. There was a monkey puzzle in this game that was really pretty interesting (you had to get the monkey to do something for you after you figured out how to communicate with it), and the graphics, while not excellent, weren't horrible. Still, unless you've run out of games of this type to play, I'd advise getting something else."
1,Road to Incompetence,"This game sounded good on the box,a real mystery,exploration,thriller type game,my favourite.What a let down.This game is a complete waste of your time.The story line is very weak,a loony guy wants to sacrifice your girlfriend to make his scarred girlfriend beautiful again.But the main problem with the game was 1-that it was way too short,I finished it in 3 days ,and I'm only able to play 1-2 hours a day!and 2-the dialogue was so cliche and nauseating,absolutely no imagination what so ever. Even the charachters were ugly to look at,no handsome hero or pretty heroine here.Sorry to be so negative,but this game was really awful,I would not recommend it to anyone,not even grandma or junior."
3,Correct and dry analysis of selected positions,"This is a collection of concrete analysis of different endgame positions produced in several training sessions with IM-level players. This means quality and reliability of the analyses and fresh material. In several cases former judgements and evaluations are corrected. Lutz' first book is a little bit like the author himself: correct, dry and with not too many words. The plus: You will improve your endgame knowledge and moreover your tactical and analytical skill by working through this book - as it is with every serious work on chess. The minus: There are few verbal explanations about the basics of that certain endgame-type and few guidance or abstracts for your practical play in similar situations. Moreover the chosen 40 positions are only a short glimpse into the world of endgame-magic. I would recommend it only to experts."
5,Excellent Complex Work,"This work is an analysis of complex practical endgames that occured in tournament practice. These types of endgames are probably the best for improving your own play, as the simple theoretical endings found in BCE and FCE can only take your play so far. The work is fairly short on words, but I suspect this is done in order to help the author remain objective since the games under discussion are his own. This book expects you to think hard about the game, but will almost certainly improve your play. BTW, Silman and John Watson both suggest this book to students interested in improving their endgame skills."
2,...*Sigh*...,"A lesson in how to create an artbook using as little art as possible! There are only around ten pictures in the entire book (the majority of pages are either text or white space), all of which can be found online in some way or another, though this is hardly the book's fault (but still! Where's the art, people?) - these pictures, a coloured sketch for each character, are then re-used later on in the book to fill another 20 pages or so. Nto good.To be fair to the book, the writing may be amazing. As I know practically no Japanese whatsoever, though, this doesn't help much (and besides - they call 'em ARTBOOKS for a reason!). So do yourself a favour, and trawl t'interweb for pics if you need 'em. Don't waste your money!"
4,Good set of playing cards,Good set of playing cards. the feeling when you are handling it is good. very nice cards to play poker with your friends. Maybe no the best quality but overall it's very good!
5,A Tomie Fan,"I love all the Tomie films, now if Amazon could just get the last 2 sequels available ""Tomie Vs Tomie"" and ""Tomie Unlimited"" my collection would be complete. ""Beginning"" is my favorite of this double feature pack, a prequel is always nice to a great franchise. ""Revenge"" was an ok story, my gripe is because ""Tomie"" doesn't get much airtime on this one in my opinion. Yes, I know that a central character other than ""Tomie"" is always the focus of each film but there were still more airtime on ""Tomie"" on the others. You don't really get much ""Tomie"" on ""Revenge"" until towards the end. Overall this is a great double feature!"
4,pure listening pleasure-revived my interest in piano,"I heard about the cd in a magazine article, took my chance and purchased and was very pleased. Kissin is my new fave. Kissin can play the full range from romantic to frantic. The pieces he plays on this recording have a light mood, not necessarily sweet, but vivacious, energetic with a touch of whimsy. But the first track on the cd ups the anticipation for the remainder of the disc which may or may not match its drama. but the other tracks are not far behind."
1,Awful - doesn't work,"This software doesn't work on Windows, but manufacturer claims it does. Everytime I tried to save my work or basically do anything when using the software it crashes. My system runs fine and every other piece of software I have on it works well - but not this one. Do not buy."
1,Keep Looking -,"Got this watch as a birthday present last week - have worn it for 4 days in an office environment and already the black is rubbing off the band. There's lots of little quality issues that keep this from being a nice watch - the second hand doesn't line up with the marks as it sweeps. The date is hard to read once it changes to two characters (10 thru 31) because the first number is partially covered by the face. The tritium is not symmetrically aligned on the watch - the glow over the 12 is offset to the left a few degrees. There is no coating on the edges of the links where they meet - so when the band flexes, you see silver color between the links. I didn't expect the quality of a Rolex at this price, but this feels and looks like a $20 watch from Walmart. I'm really disappointed and I am returning this. Shame on S&W for pushing this junk -"
3,Could be better,I've owned this watch for a while and been pretty happy with this durability. I'm very hard on my watches (I'm a firefighter) so I need something strong. The watch looks nice but I have a few complaints. For the money I would expect the second hand to line up with the second marks. It didn't. Not the end of the world but an indication of overall quality. The black coating rubs off. I had many parts of the band that were silver from the black wearing off. The main pin on either side of the watch body where the strap attaches seems weak. It's broken off my wrist twice. The first time as I slammed onto the floor after a wet floor slip (oops). The impact was pretty hard so I can understand a bit. The second time was today. Now its at the bottom of a lake. I was shocked it broke off while wakeboarding. I'll be giving Luminox a try now.
4,item great but change shipping,"item purchased is great..needed batteries changed first though. Only advise is to use usps for shipping. I paid a shipping charge, the item was sent ups and therefore cost me an additional $95 on arrival!!!! Therefore it was not a good deal at all!!"
5,My son cried!,"I had never heard of the ""Froggy"" books before until one day I was at a book fair at school. I read through the book and new it was something my (at the time 3 year old) would enjoy. He likes frogs and being with his daddy. It turns out his teacher read it to him, so he knew about the book. I purchased the book and wrapped it up so the ""school santa"" could give it to him. He was so excited he cried when he opened it,however...in the excitement of the last day of school before Christmas, his book was stolen and no one seemed to know who had it. My son cried for 2 days. I went on line to Amazon, found the book, and had it wrapped and under the tree with a note from Santa. My little boy was so excited he could have cared less about anything else. Thanks to the writers of the book for making a great series (there are more Froggy books available) and Amazon for getting it to my home the day before Christmas!"
5,A Tenor to Treasure,"Juan Diego Flores is widely touted as ""the Next Pavarotti"". In fact, he is in a class all by himself. His Rossini CD is the best CD released in this new century. This recital is number 2. No one sings Rossini like Juan Diego Flores, only Rockwell Blake comes close. In the new CD, he proves to be the equal of the young Pavarotti in Donizetti and his better in Bellini. If you love these early composers, if you treasure true bel canto singing, if you like breath-defying coloratura, buy this CD now. He is truly a tenor for the ages."
4,A CD worth having,"Keeping more in ""tune"" with his voice, Juan Diego has recorded an excellent album of great arias. His previous debut album was quite a feast for lovers of high Rossini. This new album gives a feast for just about everyone. It covers a nice range of arias from the beautiful title song to the show-stopping ""Mes Amis"". Definitely worth buying and enjoying."
1,terrible,if you are wanting the animated cartoon curious george this is not it. this is a claymation type video. it is very short and has 2 other stories that are not even curious george stories. the picture quality is terrible. this went straight to the garbage can.
5,Great Flick!!!!,True Grit meets Lonesome Dove!!!! This has fun for the whole family and a great message. Superb score and quality acting.
5,Excellent Movie,It is hard not to like the movie that you were a part of.Gave them out as Christmas gifts.
4,"A pleasant read, suprisingly.","I used this text in a personality, psychology class and enjoyed it enough to say I would have gladly read it for pleasure. Well written, at times funny and always informative. I am not the only student in my class who felt this way."
3,the right price but on German cars cheap is not always good,I installed the KYB shocks and mounts on my 96 bmw 328is and am somewhat dissapointed at the thud sound made when going over sharp bumps. I know some sound is normal but the OEM stuff was much less noisy. Bottom line is now my car sounds like a Toyota when I ht a bump.
4,Enthusiastic Schubert,"The Quintet in C on this disc is a marvellous, enthusiastic version, well-played and clearly recorded. The participants bring out nuances of the individual parts that you might not have noticed before. And the ensemble as a whole makes a very well organized and effective version of a great piece of music."
1,Not a real translation,"Translating is a tricky business, especially when the translator is dealing with esoteric literature, which wasn't meant to be read by everybody. The translator should know the language he's translating from pretty well. Unfortunately it is very obvious to anyone who knows Hebrew, that mr. Savedows knowlegde of Hebrew (and Aramaic as well) is very limited. He has made a lot of very strange mistakes and the translation consists of various elements that are NOT present in the original text. He makes ordinary Hebrew words into mysterious, magical names. I could go on, but I think it is save to say that this book is not a translation, but a not-very-much-to-do-with-the-original-text interpretion. Anyone considering to buy this book should keep this in mind."
3,Early Kabbalistic Literature,"This book is certainly interesting from a historical perspective being one of the earlier texts on Kabbalistic studies. Although it is pretty clear that it is not as old as the original author would have you believe, this Middle Age text is important from the perspective of its historical influence. This book's focus is on the branch of practical Kabbalah. From my view, the significance of the book does not lie in its magical incantations and gematria but its naming of various angels and divisions of heaven and hell. Unfortunately from my perspective these discussions were extremely brief. The only thing I would have liked to see done differently would have been keeping the appearance and form of the Hebrew alphabet instead of transforming them into English where the author was not trying to phonetically use Hebrew. This book is extremely hard to follow and even less practical. Therefore, if you are not a student of historical religion you may be disappointed."
5,great service,This is a very informative book and do hope that a lot of readers will consider purchasing this book.
2,A book (books) with high meditational value,"The book has some interesting history on jewish astronomy, but the english translation has once agian stripped it of its real meanings, as any real kabbalist (not qabalist) would agree."
5,Wonderful product,"This oil makes my relaxed hair feel extremely smooth and soft. After reading about brahmi amla and the properties the herb has, I tried it on my son's skin (he has a bit of exzema) and it's healing it super fast. It's working much better than his prescriptin cream from the doctor! This oil (and the powder also) is a gift. Try it...you'll love it!"
5,one oft he products I used,"I really loved this oil it makes your hair shiny,managable,condition and strnghthens at the same time. who ever buys this product will be lucky and happy with what they brought. ""Just like my family memebers say"" you pay for what you get."
2,Hair Oil,this product doesn't have a pleasant smell. It also has mineral oil in it. Does it work? I need to give it some more time since I just bought this product to see if does help stimulate the hair follicle to make your hair grow long and thick.
4,Good oil,"I am sadden that I purchased this product from Amazon.com, when I found this product at my local grocer for cheaper. The oil has a woodsy smell but its bareable, I have noticed a difference in my hair, no more shedding and it is much stronger."
1,false advertising !,there is nothing natural about this oil...it is mostly artificial junk and did nothing for my hair. supposed to be herbal and natural but didnt work.
1,Hesh Brahmi,"I was so excited when I first got this product. because I thought is was going to really grow my hair like it claimmed to on the back of the box, but I felt disappointed because it did not live up to it's name."
1,This Oil is Poor Quality ! And it Ruined My Hair.,"SO I bought this Brahmi Alma Oil for my hair. My hair has dry ends and I thought this was going to help out as the explanation on the back side of the bottle claims it should. What happened is entirely opposite. I felt as though I was actually rubbing baby oil onto my scalp. It smells and feels just like baby oil =] However, it was so bad on my hairs. The next morning in my shower I noticed little peices of my hair everywhere on the shower walls and on my shampoo bottles, every where.I couldn't believe it. What seemed to be so easy to use and gentle was DEFINATELY NOT. It would be fine if it didn't break off my hairs, and if this oil had a more natural list of ingredients."
3,Great product - delayed shipping,"The product has been working wonders on my hair. Its really good.. makes your hair darker, stronger and denser. The only problem was the seller, He didn't provide any shipping tracking no. I was left guessing the arrival time. & it took little more than the usual shipping time(around 7-8 business days)."
1,Worthless,I'm sorry I spent the money on this CD. The music is trite and boring and it is not conducive to the sinuous belly dancing that I favor. It is too shrill and lacks any sort of continuity that I can fathom. Don't waste your money.
5,Important book for all inquiring students,"The Student Edition of The Case for Faith is not a dumbed-down version of the adult book by former investigative journalist Lee Strobel. Rather, this book explores the same issues that are so well dissected in the adult book and yet examines them from the perspective of a young person. It covers topics that are thoroughly relevant to all students: How can there be a loving God with so much evil in the world? How can we believe in miracles when they contradict modern science? How can we believe in a divine Creator in light of evolutionary theory? How can anyone believe Jesus is the only route to God? How can a loving God send people to hell? And how much doubts can a person have and still be a Christian? The book uses timely illustrations and examples and goes beyond sound bite answers. I enthusiastically recommend this book to young people and to youth pastors who are seeking to help students come to grips with these faith-testing issues."
5,Questions of faith aimed at inquiring students,"Lee Strobel has written several good books that could be especially valuable to someone new in the Christian faith. This is a revised version of his book The Case for Faith, which goes quite nicely with his first book, The Case for Christ. In this edition of The Case for Faith, Strobel--who is a former skeptic--continues where he left off with The Case for Christ. He interviews scholars all over the country, picking their brains for answers to some of the toughest questions out there, including evil, miracles, and ""oppressive"" church history. I thought the novelistic style helped make the book a quick read. Teens who want to understand their Christian faith will be helped by reading this book. While it will not solve all of their dilemmas or give answers to each and every question, the information provided by Strobel will certainly help. Overall I recommend The Case for Faith for its apologetic value."
3,Good product but don't buy it here,"Generally, I like this laptop. Everything is perfect such as display, weight, and heat release. But don't buy it here. Why? because I got an openbox laptop. Need to ship it back and exchange for a unopen one."
4,Received as an 'Open Box' from Amazon !!,I ordered this laptop from Amazon despite reading the warning in the review below and indeed received an OPEN BOX!!I am sending it back too and am not sure if I will receive an NEW unopened laptop if I was to reorder.I wonder if any one in customer service can assure me this?
3,Casing weak!,"First view is great design/color; light weight, functional built in camera! After using you discover; plastic casing parting in front seam,keyboard loose on left side, and fan inefficient at cooling system."
2,Don't ever break a USB port,"Who would have thought a 20 cent dongle would cost $600 to repair? Yes, the USB ports are welded to the motherboard. Yikes. Sony's support has been going downhill, in this case practically useless."
2,Not worth the money,"Not a bad product overall, just has flaws. The webcam picture quality is not that great. I dislike the fact that the volume controls and what not are shared with the F keys. The design is not good for traveling. I learned that from personal experience. The fan is noisy, and the laptop itself gets really hot. Compared to cheaper laptops, this is definitely not worth the price I paid. I even got it on sale at Best Buy. I also paid for the 3 year warranty, and I turned it in to get it fixed after it had fell (that was my fault). Let me just say that the Geek Squad did not do a good job at the repair of it. My sound did not work after I got it back, when before that I did not have a problem with it. The screen is separated from the frame at the bottom. I really don't like my laptop after two years. For some reason I didn't get any back-up discs with my initial purchase of the laptop. I was not an experienced buyer then. I don't recommend this to anyone."
3,Laptop Functionality,"I know that many of you may have rated this low because of the open box issue with Amazon. I don't blame you, but some reviewers did not mention anything about the performance of the notebook or if they were happy with the notebook itself(or if they tested it at all). Please include information about the performance, if possible. Since the reviews come from people who have actually purchased the actual items, I have found them to be very reliable when I have researched before buying. I would like to express my gratitude to the people who have taken the time to leave these reviews so that consumers can make a well-informed decision before purchasing."
2,"Good selection, bad sound.","I had to step in when I saw this collection had only a single, 5-star rating to go on. Oh well, just a little caveat emptor- listen before you buy. Most of these selections have poor sound quality which gets worse as the volume and the quality of the sound system goes up."
2,"Good teacher, instruction for basic passe1970s/80s dancing","Chapters include:BEGINNER - Rhythm in Place (stepping in place, bending your knees, pelvic thrusts, hip bumps), Taps (step-tap), Points (pointing your foot), Different levels (bend your knees), Chasses (double step), Review of 1-5 INTERMEDIATE - Grapevine, Turns, Hip Rolls, Walks, Swivels, Review of 6-10From the clips you will see this is old style, passe, 1970s, 1980s Solid Gold, Soul Train dancing.Kasia Kozak is a great teacher though, she shows both front & back views, normal speed first, breaks it down & tells you what body part to move instead of just counting. I will try her hip hop possibly which you can see clips on youtube, etc. on.I like Kasia & the decent production & pace. I took off 3 stars for the style of dance, lack of music during instruction even softly & lame music when they do dance to music.PreviewsYoutube com under ""Anyone Can Dance Nightclub Freestyle"" & ""Anyone Can Dance: Night Club Freestyle DVD Preview""totalvid com"
2,Too Heady,"I was excited when I ordered this book. I obviously didn't know what I was getting into. The author used very big, and often obscure words, to explain already complex Buddhist teachings. I gifted it to a second-hand book store. Maybe someone else will get it more than I did."
2,"S-9896 pressure cooker gasket seal, fits Mirro.","Product imageS-9896 pressure cooker gasket seal, fits Mirro.The received ring does not have 9896 identification that I expected.The ring is slightly thinner than the old one which I still have and does have the identification.The one provided does not seal the lid tightly, allowing some steam to escape. I ordered a new one because the old one had become stiff and allowed steam to escape. The new one is barely better."
3,Pressure Canner Ring,"My old ring would stick, almost could not get the top to release, so ordered this new one. It works find--the first time. But the second use, if immediately after, does not build up pressure. I canned 4 pts of beans, opened it, took the jars out, checked the pressure hole to be sure it was clear, and tried to cook another 4 pts, but the pressure would not build up. I could hear the water boiling inside, but the beans in the jare overcooked, while the pressure did not build up.Also, I make stew--browned and cooked the meat for 15 min, as I used to, then let it cool 5 min, opened and added the vegetables to cook another 15 minutes, but the pressure never build up again. I ended up with mushy, cooked vegetables in the stew, instead of the nice, 10-min finish. I even tried washing the lid and ring, and putting them back on, but cannot get the pressure to build up, when I start with a hot pan. Is the ring semi-old?"
1,S-9896 pressure cooker seal.,"tried to use this gasket/seal, wasn't thick enough to seal. Put the old seal back in to finish cooking. USELESS!!"
2,didn't fit,the gasket was not thick enough and also was not the correct size around. it was supposed to be the correct gasket for the model number i had but it was not!
5,Heavy and Solid!,I have to say this is the best bargain I picked up on Amazon. This should be priced at $80.00!The board is Very thick and has a good weight and feel to it and Rock Solid! Don't think twice If you read my review then just go and buy it! You will not be disappointed!
4,momofthree,I purchased these sleeping bags for my 8& 10 year old girls. They have enjoyed them immensely. They have set them up in their bedrooms and have used them to read and play on. We have not yet inflated them but they have stayed inflated since we bougth them (about a month ago). I would highly recommend them and think they are a great value for the money!
3,BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BIBLE WITH IMPORTANT MISSING FEATURE,"THIS VISUALLY ELEGANT AND THEOLOGICALLY COMPLETE LITTLE BIBLELACKS THE ALL IMPORTANT ZIPPER OR SNAP FLAP DESCRIBED IN THEAMAZON ""EDITORIAL REVIEW."" AS A POCKET OR PERSONAL-SIZED BIBLE IS OFTEN USED WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A TABLE, AND CARRIED IN A PURSE OR BRIEFCASE, IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE PROTECTED FROM DAMAGE WHILE IT IS IN TRANSIT."
3,Fast paced but gets old.,"I read this story after seeing the movie Stir of Echoes. It started out really good. I couldn't put it down. Then it sort of did the same thing over and over again. It leads you in one direction only to completely surprise you, but this only works a couple of times. After a while, I was left having a good idea of what was going to happen next. The ending was very unbelievable. Still, because of good pacing, it's not a totally bad read."
4,TRICKY TREATS,"This book reminds me very much of such stage classics as ""Sleuth"" and ""Deathtrap"", wherein there are several plot twists and character turns that stump the audience. That said, Matheson has created a tongue-in-cheek murder mystery, enhanced by the utilization of a stroke victim (also termed a ""vegetable"") as the narrator.The plot revolves around a magician's revenge on his unfaithful wife and agent. Though at times a little labored, the narrative flows smoothly and the twists at the end are surprising.This is not classic Matheson, but the man's genius as a writer remains evident in this compact little story."
4,A worth-reading book...very suspenseful,"R. Matheson captures pure irony, subtle comedy, and horror in this one. It is a page-turning suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very surprising and unexpected end. Matheson is truly one of the masters of horror right under Stephen King and Robert McCAMMON!!!!"
2,worst Matheson novel,"This story was so convoluted and ridiculous i felt like I was the one who'd had a trick played on him. I love Matheson, and i think his body of work is incredible. But this felt like it was written by a 6TH grader. You ever listen to a child tell a story...""and then he did this, and then he did this, and then everyone suddenly had invisible forcefields""...I seriously doubt there was any type of outline for this. It just jumps from one random moment to the next. The characters are annoying, and the twists were ridiculously improbable. Save yout time and money and read Hell House or I am Legend or somethign that proves how good Matheson is. Because this ain't it."
2,This is Mystery-Not Horror,"I really don't know if I'd classify Richard Matheson as a ""horror"" writer. So far I've read ""7 Steps to Midnight"" and this one, as well as seen the movies ""Stir of Echoes"", ""What Dreams May Come"" and ""Somewhere in Time"". The only one that classifies as horror is ""Stir of Echoes"". The books are more suspense/thriller/mystery type material and the movies are romantic dramas! I guess if you like Sherlock/Holmes stories, you'd like this book, but not if you're looking for good horror. I still plan to read ""Hell House"" since it gets such marvelous reviews as ""true horror"". But I was let down on this book since I was anticipating horror and didn't get any."
1,what happened??,The first 2 seasons of the Sopranos is some of the best on television. Let's hope season 3 was a mistake.
5,The year of liberation,"This season, the third of many we hope, is a real turn point to the serie. The dead of the mother, the moving of the child to college and the revelation of the real origin of his anxiety attacks are the big challenges to T. S.. This season is also more truely to the real mobs day to day living. The family and the Family affairs. The violence on every thing people do.A great season that I will glady review. And review."
5,Amazing Show,"I just got the first two seasons on DVD as a gift and I am blown away by how amazing this series is. James Gandolfini is an excellent actor who brings the life a stranger Mob boss to life. this show is extremely funny in its own peculiar way, but it is serious and gruesome as any mob movie/show is accustom to being. I highly recommnend you to buy this and the first two seasons even if you dont like Mafia stuff, you will love this!"
1,want to return and cannot,I purchrased it new and it was used and does not work. I boutght it in NOvember and started watching the series. I am on the third season and it does not play. I am trying to return it but it is after the deadline. Whi watches a series of movies in 30 days
5,Sopranos season 3,This is the season where you go from really liking the show to completely addicted. Arguably the best show ever.
3,Sopranos,I bought this entire set as a gift and I must say if you are a fan go ahead and get them all. As I started buying more they became harder to find. The stores seldom carry them and if they do its over priced.
3,Return,I donot have sufficient documentation to properly return this product. I donot have sufficient documentation to properly return this product.
4,"It's the Sopranos, what more do you need","I am a tremendous Sopranos fan. The minute I saw the first episode, I ate it up. The combination of the Mafia and family drama, along with the heavily symbolic writing, makes for my personal favorite show. That being said, it is possible to understand why it is that many fans don't like the Third season as much as the previous two. There is much more of a focus on the family edge of the show and there's less of a show of the Mafia side, at least for the first half of the season. Don't get me wrong, it is still amazing; the cast is still stellar; the story lines are still engaging; and for those of you who love to see the usual crime sprees of the characters, that is still there, just not as much as in previous seasons. In short, you may not enjoy it as much as seasons 1 and 2, but you will definitely still have a good time watching."
1,Sopranos third season,This product was a bootlegged copy of the Sopranos. I have reported that fact to the proper authorities.
3,Best DVD Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Sopranos Season 3 is the best season! The DVD is made with great features. I own the first 2 but this must be a must own for all fans. It also include the best episode of The Sopranos, Pine Barrens. The Sopranos is the best show on tv! You would be a fool not to get this dvd!"
3,not as good as the previous seasons,"this is somewhat of a disappointment as some rather lackluster events happen in this particular installment of sopranos. the plot is nowhere as gripping as the original and some of the ""mafia"" element that made the series so attractive is a bit lost. this season also tends to focus less on the main characters and edge off to the supporting roles, which while intriguing does not compare to the fun of the mob/family balance itself. hopefully the next season will improve.extras are limited to basic commentaries, other than that, this dvd set lacks good bonus features."
2,Sorry,"I have heard so much about this series that really wanted to see what is all about. SORRY, didn't like it. Maybe the other seasons are better, but I'm not going to try."
4,a lively season,"This is a favorite season of my family--the powerful rape of Dr. Melfi still gets to me (how she could not tell Tony!) and shows how she is a better person then most. Gloria and Tony were the funnest paring to watch as Tony met his match in her. Pine Barrens is of course a classic in the Christopher/Paulie relationship--I don't think is has ever again been presented better. The addtion of Ralphie made a nice arch-type to Tony, but I could have done with less Jackie Jr."
1,3 revisions short of a 1st edition,"I bought this book on the recommendation of the early reviewers. Bad choice. I think the reason why one reviewer recommended this book after data structures is because it was so poorly written as a introductory textbook the reviewer was able to fill in the gaps himself.The preface states that no C programming is assumed, so it should be for a beginner. I would submit that this would only be true by re-reading the text several times and parsing the information into more natural categories for better understanding.The information was there, possibly, but why waste your time.C++ Primer Plus is an excellent book, with appropriate humor, carries only about 10% bloat, and more reasonably priced."
3,Not as good as the coment already posted,"For beginner, it fail to explain clearly; for professional it too simple. So got my average point. I never recomend such book."
5,Thank God for Enid,"Growing up as a child, Enid Blyton books were all I read, I cannot begin to explain how much I love reading and how often I do it. For years I tried finding her books and couldn't, it seems the stores in the U.S don't carry her books. But finally I was able to find them because I want all of my neices to be able to experience the joy I had once I opened one of her books. I'm in the process of purchasing as many as I can. My child will also be a fan of Enid. She allows children to be children. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
5,Enid Blyton's fantasies make for the pleasantest memories,It's been an age and then some since I read this book but I have only pleasant memories of the story. Enid Blyton's fantasies were always fascinating and entertaining for me and the Wishing Chair stories no less so than any of the others. Enid Blyton weaves a story that transports you to a fun and fanciful place where the adventures are exciting and the happy endings always come. Perfect for pre-teens and even teens who still like their adventure tales less fraught with danger and nightmare fodder than the average Harry Potter installment.
1,Far to weak.,"As one who rocks the Pompadour I found this product to weak to hold the glorious shape of a Pomp. I am sure for a more conservative hairstyle this might do the trick but for a Greaser style avoid this product.The consistency is that of hair gel as opposed to the waxy goodness that is Murray's Pomade or even some of the other Dax products (Wave and Groom looks a lot better).So if your looking for the Greaser look and need the strength to hold a Pomp, pass on this product."
1,How to play this recording!!!!,"I was interested in the complaints about miking or mixing, but didn't think too much about it... UNTIL I got the CD a couple of months ago.I was angry!!! Because, like Mr.Doucet, I could hardly hear Hilary. I have since figured out why.One reason fixable and one reason not.The non fixable first. As we age many or most of us lose some of the ability to hear higher notes. I'm 67.The fixable one. What I could hear I loved, so I kept playing with it. Finally I tried leaving the treble volume normal, but reducing the bass a lot. SUCCESS!!! There was Hilary, quite hearable. And the big strong Beethoven bass and middle chords were still big and strong, but didn't bury her. Now I love this recording.I also have copies of her (also Sony) Mendelssohn and Brahams concertos which were (for me) improved by this bass reduction.I hope this helps someone."
4,A Telling Time New Year's Story,In this book the polar bear invites various animals to his new year's party. It's a great math story for telling time to the hour.
2,Thats all!,"Read it in a day passed the exam, but I don't think it helped not one bit I returned it. Still waiting for my refund!"
4,Up to speed quickly.,"This little book will quickly bring you up to speed on how to use the HP 33s equation input and solving features. You may or may not agree with the author's selection of ""Essential"" equations. I would say buy this book if you just bought the calculator and your exam is just a couple of weeks (or less) away. If you've got time, the HP 33s manual does a good job of explaining the basics also."
3,Maybe not worth it.,"I ordered this book. It wasn't what I expected. I hoped to see more programs. This book simply gives the equations (which you can find in the CERM), and if you know how to use solve on your calculator this book doesn't seem to do much more.It does give a recommended list of equation that you are more likely to see during the exam and how to place them as an equation (if you don't know how to do this it might be a good book).If you are going to buy this book consider 1st if you know how to enter an equation in your HP33s then you probably don't need this book. It doesn't have any programs."
2,"""Essential""?","The title is very misleading. How can these equations possibly be ""essential"" when hundreds (thousands?) of examinees pass every year without using this book or programming their calculator? The time spent inputting programs into your calculator would be much better spent studying. No programs are required to pass the exam."
2,How much do you need it for PE/FE Exam,"If, for whatever reason, you end up going for this HP33 calculator to use it in a PE/FE exam, you will not need anything more than the manual which comes with the calculator, and which has some examples.If you are an engineer, you are able to select and enter the formulas/equations yourself."
4,helped me pass the PE,"The HP 33 is not a user friendly calculator (neither is the owners manual) but this book definetly helps you understand it's programability well it spoon feeds exactly what & how to enter the calulations. It helps more with the a.m. general session since you encounter more straitforward ""plug and chug"" problems, but still helpful in the p.m. Time is the shortest commodity in a test, so give yourself a little edge and run through the equations faster with your calculator preprogrammed. Very handy for equations where you have to solve for y in a y^n form, let the calculator do the iterations and algebra in a second, instead of spending precious time working it out by hand. But program early and work problems with your calculator so you can help determine if the answers coming out are reasonable ""garbage in -> garbage out"""
5,There aren't enough stars,To the Golden Shore is one of the most profound books I've ever read. The depth of dedication shown by Adoniram Judson and his family over the years of his ministry leaves me without words. It will break your heart and inspire you to make better use of your time on earth.Every Christian should read this book.And everyone who has read it needs to share it with someone who hasn't.
3,"Good intentions, but lacking.","I like the authors style and perspective but when it comes to mere scientific methodology the author is lackinig in his investigation. Not a scientific approach at all and conclusions are a-priori. I rather he wrote a book about what he thinks black men in Harlem are than doing an investigation of sorts with only a control group. He only based his assumptions on a type and class of black men that would recommend to him others ""like themselves"". So you can't really define black men in Harlem if you only hang around with a similar group of guys that know one another all too well. Read it if you into black male sociology, but otherwise, nah."
4,Beautiful Blue Note,"This a great sampler of an even greater series of reissue compilations from legendary jazz label blue note records. Being that it is a sampler, there are quite a few varied styles here, not that that is always a bad thing. The only time it does create a slightly unbalanced listen is on the funky ""expressway to your heart"", which opens the album. Though i really like the song, it doesn't really fit in with all the other jazz oriented tracks. a great economical sampler."
4,Great Sampler BUT ....,It is a nicely priced sampler but the problem is you're going to want to pick up at least 3-5 other CD/LP's after listening once because every track is brilliant so you might as well just click LISTEN above and go any buy the FULL CD's the great tracks come from :-)Listening to great jazz by individual tracks collected together is a losing proposition anyway :-)
4,Save That Dog,I enjoyed reading this book. It helped me to understand my English Springer Spaniel a little better. I got a lot of useful information about training my little guy.
3,A little bit outdated,"Yes, it's useful. And relatively good. However, in addition that the colors are a bit strong, and often it's hard to see the roads, the information seems to be a bit outdated. Important roads in Yucatan, several ""autopistas"", and some reservoirs are missing, though most of them have been completed several years ago. It's a bit of a pitty that ITMB's usually good quality is becoming bad by not investing enough time into updating the information."
5,easy to replace,took about ten minutes to replace while in the middle of nowhere north dakota with minimal tools. And it works like it should.
3,Pretty Decent Set,"The primary selling point for me was that it contained a 5/16"" bit.It's just about the only 'set' which contains such a bit.For some reason, sellers jack the price of individual 5/16"" bits.Beware: the first set I received was pretty rusty, but the replacement Amazon sent is in fine shape."
5,This Album Kicks Butt!!,"This is one of my favorite albums every. Very hard to categorize. Basically Amerikan/Eastern-European Punk. Band members hail from Bosnia (Serb and Croat ethnicities), Bulgaria, Japan, and Seattle. Sound is both foreign and Amerikan. Very punk, while also exotic Eastern-Euro. Butthole Surfers meets Fiddle on the Roof (really, meets Boban Markovics, but I suspect you don't know that Serbian brass band)."
1,Social Science Doesn't Mix Well With Humor,"""Seinology"" was a major disappointment and was perhaps one of the worst books I've read in years. Unless you're Mary Roach, using humor to explain science usually doesn't work. ""Seinology"" is no exception. Referencing ""Seinfeld"" episodes as examples, Delaney attempts to explain sociology's basic principles. The result is a flat, colorless review of most of the show's nine-year history. In addition to sucking the comedic relief out of one the best sitcoms ever written, Delaney does not serve his field of sociology well either. Given the vast diversity of global societies, it seems like academic negligence to approach such a broad topic through the lens of one popular American sitcom. If you love ""Seinfeld"" and/or the study of sociology, avoid this book."
5,A top pick for college-level sociology courses,"Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David's syndicated show SEINFELD succeeds in large part because it's packed with social observations blended with comedy. The effect is hard-hitting and fun, and here in SEINOLOGY: THE SOCIOLOGY OF SEINFELD, sociology professor Tim Delaney examines how these social observations work. Chapters consider key facets of sociology and how they relate to Seinfeld shows, using chapters titled after some of the show's famous incidents to illustrate. A top pick for college-level sociology courses which wish to connect to student interests and experiences to teach or introduce the field of sociology.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,Plot Summaries,"To be fair, I didn't actually read the entire book. I just skimmed through a couple of pages in the bookstore. However, there didn't seem to be much sociological or scientific content at all. The author would write 2 sentences stating something obvious (such as that people frequently break the law) then spend the next 2 pages recounting episode summaries of Seinfeld (there was the one where Newman has traffic tickets, and the one where...).Save your money and buy an actual book about sociology, or an actual Seinfeld DVD. Either would be more entertaining and enlightening than this book."
5,mommy go away,allows the child to act out the fantasy of being in charge of the world-and as such to gain a sense of competence about the self.
2,"Kid says ""Mommy Go Away""","My child hadn't said ""Mommy Go Away"" until we read this book together. The idea of a child taking on the parent role was intriguing at first but the resolution did not justify the impression it left on my daughter. Had the message of the book been better at the end, children who regularly say things like, ""Mommy, Go away"" might have been better redirected."
3,Decaf tea looses flavor,What I like about Assam tea is the specific flavor that distinguishes it from all other teas. High blood pressure forced me to try a decaffeinated version. I found the resulting tea disappointing: It lost a real lot of its flavor.
3,Good book to test your knowledge of Java,"Java Faq is a good book to test your Understanding of Java. I think the book serves as a reference for people, who already knows the language and are working on learning the language."
4,If only this can be diagnostic...,"A woman using this product but still experiencing difficulty managing the flow needs to realize there is a problem and should consult a good and reputable specialist in obstetrics and gynecology. For example: if you have to wake up every three hours or replace the pads every two hours during daytime even though you are using this type of pad, that is a problem no woman should be putting up with."
4,You get what you put into it,"I guess the previous reviewer never heard of QVC?? Whether you buy a product on-line, off of the television or from a traditional storefront you need to pay attention to the quality of the product and the accuracy of the financial transaction. I've had good and bad experiences no matter where I've purchsed a product. I've used several of Mr. Sheets courses and have learned something from each of them. As a result I'm succesfully investing in real estate."
2,Not Like Picture,"The bedskirt with this set is not at all like the picture, it is the same fabric and pattern as the comforter. So there is no contrast, the whole set looks the same, and is a little overbearing, like a giant couch! Materials are very good, heavy, and corded. I will be returning."
3,Not big enough for the 7 - 12 plate level,"The case is very handy, but the 7 - 12' plate level when installed into the case can not be zipped shut. I guess it would be alright for shorter ones though. Still nice to have the level in a case, even if you can't zip it."
5,Nice Case,"The case is well made. Mine fits the 7-12' plate level and zips closed without a problem. The previous reviewer may have a defective case or perhaps may not have the plate level completely collapsed.The case does not come with a shoulder strap, which would be a nice addition. It would also be nice if the case would accomodate one or two longer levels (like the 78 inch jamber), rather than the shorter 48"" and 24""."
2,Too role specific - only applicable if grandma in the picture,This book is specific about roles - I am on bedrest with a great husband who is doing everything but the book has the husband watching football on tv while grandma does everything for the family. Wish there was something that didn't focus on specific roles for everyone - it doesn't even make sense to my child as our scenario does not include a doting grandma but a dedicated father. The father in the book is some idiot who watches tv all day and is like another child that needs to be cared for - I feel sorry for the author.
3,"It Works, But It's a Bad Design","I'll agree with most, it does save time overall, but I really have to ask: who designed this thing? Sheesh! Why on earth would you have the dirt and dirty water empty into the same cup? To make muck pies? I have to do one floor at a time, so the container is *always* wet from the previous floor and the sludge is gross.Any time you have to empty it, you need to rinse it and chances are it the top needs a rinse as well. Even removing the filter doesn't keep it dry and the filter gets moldy real fast.Sure, I use it 'cause it works, but everytime I do I shake my head and wonder whether the engineers who designed it ever even used it, or if they were put under pressure to cut corners to meet a deadline or price."
2,Worked great for six months,"I liked this floor cleaner when I first purchased it. The suction was okay. It was never great but okay. I still had to sweep in the corners before using it. After six months of use, there is no more sunction. I tried taking it apart and cleaning it but that didn't really help. I was also disappointed with the quality of the product. It is made out of cheap plastic and unit that holds the dirty water doesn't seal properly. I was always told by my grandmother to always get a Hoover. The quality has changed greatly over the years."
5,Hoover Floormate : You gotta have one!!!!!,I have never loved a product more!!! It's taken the work out of doing my floors. I have tile and laminate. It's FABULOUS!!!My floors have never looked shinier and the cleaning products make the entire house smell clean.
1,One expensive clock and night light,Mine worked for about 3 weeks. The title of my review says it all.Not worth the money.
3,Not the answer for a big home,"I have a 2500 sq ft home that is all hard flooring. It's just less work in the long run for a good deep clean to get the commercial Rubbermaid bucket out and mop.That being said, it comes in handy for when my relatives give me an hour notice of their impending arrival. It does do the pet highway in a hurry.I don't use the soap recommended because of the expense, plus it streaks and leaves the floors sticky. I use hot water and vinegar, sorry can't tell you the percentages.I love it for my kitchen and I wished I used it everyday.It's not a massive pain to clean, but I don't like the fact it takes a least 3 times of dumping to scrub 300 sq ft.I don't use it on my laminate, because it leaves the floor too wet and I still have to dry mop. Easier to use the bucket and mop.My best friend has the same model as mine and she wouldn't live without it. She has linoleum and hardwood floors. She also uses diluted Fabuloso for her cleaning solution."
1,Junk,"The only good thing about this cleaner is that the shipping was free. The handle was a pain to assemble. We have all tile floors and I was hoping for a cleaner that would do it all. The thought into the product was good, but it doesn't work as advertised. (I bought the delux model by the way). After cleaning there were marks/streaks left by the solution the vacuum doens't pickup. The little bit of solution it did pick up was obviously dirty, but when I had to wipe down the tile to get rid of the streaks, I found all kinds of more dirt coming off on the paper towel. That tells me it left most of the dirt behind.I hate returning things, so I'll just give this to my step-son, who also has tile floors.I'll stick to the 14"" sponge mop and divided bucket.Peter"
5,So much easier than mopping!,The Hoover Floormate is fantastic. It is so quick and easy to use. It does a much better job than mopping and the cleaning solution is cheap. I have used mine for years with no problems.
2,Look For Repair Shop First,"Don't even think about buying a Floor Mate unless you know where the nearest Hoover reapir shop is. This is the second one I've bought in the last 8 months. The first was a basic model. The motor burned up after 3 months. The Hoover shop repaired it in 1 week. I bought this one as a back up. It lasted ONE MONTH before the motor burned up. So far it's been in the shop for almost 4 weeks. They say Hoover hasn't sent a motor. I wish I'd returned it to Amazon. It would have been MUCH faster!When it works, the Floor Mate is great. Nothing cleans like it. It's just not reliable."
2,Purchase a Swiffer instead,"I purchased the Hoover Floormate last week and am returning it. We recently built a new house with all hardwood floors and tile. I was looking for a quick and easy way to clean my floors and the Floormate is definitely not what I thought it would be! First the suction is not powerful at all, so you may as well plan on sweeping or using your regular vacuum for this. Secondly, after using the wet scrub, the floor looked good; however, when the floor dried, there were streaks all over (even using the drying action). I immediately picked up my Swiffer and went back over the floor and it looks terrific. Save your money on this one! The cleaning solution and filters are also very expensive and clean-up is time consuming. After all is said and done, I don't see where you are saving any time over mopping."
2,Thumbs DOWN,"Like so many of the other reviewers, I too thought that this product was a waste of too much money. After just a couple of months it no longer produced results. The water container is too small to be effective and the sprayer is a joke. I found I had to apply water from a cup in order to have anything to pick up. So many spots were missed that I just threw the thing in the trash. Very disappointed."
4,good deal,"i was skeptical but tried this anyway. i am sick of ineffective and laborsome floor cleaning. at first, i had the machine set up wrong, so it was a sloppy mess. then i straightened it all out and was very happy with the work of the floor mate. it left my hardwood floor clean and free of the film i hated so much. it really dries the floor well and it gets a lot of dirt up. i expect my floors to get even cleaner as time goes on. yes, you do have to empty it a couple of times, that is why i gave only four stars. this is a great machine that saves work and does a superior job."
2,where's the humidity?,My skin is so dryand my throat is dry tooI purchased this thingto dampen the twoit runs and it runsbut nowhere I seeany sign of the hu-mi-di-ty
2,needs more scrubbing power,"I was not too impressed with this product. I tried to use it to clean my kitchen floor. My garage is next to the kitchen. The kitchen floor always has dirty / salty footprints during the winter. I tried running the floormate over the floor to clean those footprints. After a few passes, they were still visible. Next I ran a few passes across them from another direction. A little more of the footprints were picked up, but not all. I double checked the instructions to be sure I had the correct cleaning solution, and made sure all of the switches were in the correct setting for floor scrubbing. I guess man still has not invented a machine that does as good a job as getting down on your knees with a brush & bucket of hot soapy water. If your floor is just a little dirty, then this should work for you. If your floor is extra grimy, then keep the bucket & brush."
4,Easy floor cleaner,"Very skeptical buying the Floormate, so read all reviews and decided if it didn't do the job for me I'd take it back. My dog tracks in mud and dirt and I'm unable to keep up with his mess. Now, I can clean up in no time with minimal effort and keep my kitchen floor clean. Really clean! I like it so well that in the morning I will buy a Hoover SteamVac for the carpet. Read those reviews too! Get one and enjoy really clean floors."
2,Dissatisfied,"The Hoover Floor Mate does not work correctly. I was sent a used one, evidently, as there was not brochure in the box. When button is pushed for liquid release, nothing comes out the bottom. I will have to spend money to take it to a shop for repairs. I am very dissatisfied with this product sent to me. Never have had such a problem with any other products in the past.Jann Cissna"
4,Cleans all but the grout.,I purchased my Floormate after watching an info-mercial. I was very pleased with no longer having to mop and rinse and dry and handle dirty water. The Floormate is quick and easy. It cleans all flat even floors very well. But the grout on my tile floor looks neglected. This was disappointing. The other thing to be aware of is the need to carefully click all the pieces together before you start cleaning. If you don't you will get all kinds of unexpected drips and spills! Lastly the replacement of the filters and the cleaning of the brushes. Although these tasks are not terrible they are still an added hassel. No such thing as a free lunch. You still have to do some work!
4,Good Machine But...,"Has a hard time with very dirty floor. Because of the suction while scrubbing, the cleaner doesn't stay on the floor to do any appreciable work. Once the floor is clean, it maintains it well."
3,A LITTLE better than mop and pail,"I FINALLY broke down and bought one after seeing it for $$$ at Wal-Mart(which made me wonder if they are discontinuing it). True, it is a lousy vacuum cleaner (I think it's because the squeegee gets in the way)and the bristles are so soft that it won't removed gunk stuck to the floor and it's lousy with grout. You use a lot of Lysol Floormate concentrate (I'm having trouble finding it in stores)and the holding/solution tanks are pitifully small. But is it better than a mop and bucket? YES. At least with the FloorMate I feel I'm sucking the dirt up as opposed to sloshing it around with the mop-and-pail method. Anyhoo, I would recommend that consumers wait for the second generation on this model."
2,Am I out of luck or what,"Bought this thing from [another retailer], spent about half an hour assembling it. The scrub part is ok, I was able to get dirt off the floor. The problem is it won't suck the dirty water off. So I had to use the regular mop, what a hassle! Another thing is moving this thing turned out to be awkward because it's light weight. Plus, you had to clean this thing after use. Had to return it immediately. Before you buy it, make sure it works at your local store to save a trip or two."
1,the brush is way to soft & to short.,This would be a perfect floor cleaner if you could purchase a stiffer longer brush if you have Italian Porclin Tile like I have that is a rough surface. The brushes that came with my floormate barly touches the floor. The what they call grout brush only has the outsde brushes and they are not long enough to do any type of cleaning at all. I called customer service and was informed that what came with the unit is all they have and no stiffer longer brushes will ever be available.It does pick up the water after I mop the old fashioned way with a regular old mop.
2,great idea but bearings are cheap,i have had 3 of these and each time the bearings inside went and it always happened with in 2 years.i am looking for one that can last longer now.also the other thing is the brushes dont reach the grout if your grout is a little deep.it will only get the top of the tile.
3,water does not come up anymore,"It has been working for me very well for about four years. I only use it like once or twice a month. Now suddenly the cleaning solution does not come up no matter how I squeeze the releasing handle. Without being able to release the cleaner solution, it is wasted."
2,cleans but made with cheap parts that always break,I purchased the floor mate several years ago. I was very pleased with the way it cleaned although it was cumbersome to change the water and cleaning solution so often. I use the product maybe once a month perhaps two. Since I purchased the product I have had to repair it at least 4 to 5 times and now it is broken again. It is usually the wheel assembly that breaks (just seems to crack because it is made of really cheap plastic). If Hoover could fix the quality of the machine I think consumers would be much happier. When machine is working it does a good job of cleaning the floors which can be witnessed by the very dirty water that shows up in the tank.
4,Great!,"I really love it, and my floors finally feel CLEAN. I don't mind walking around the house now without shoes! I love that I dont have to sweep, then mop - because does that dust pan line ever really go away? And with mopping I always kinda felt like I was just pushing the dirt around. My only gripe is that sometimes over simple spots on the floor that would come right up with a mop, you have to go over a few times with this. Also, sometimes mine will leave a little spot of dirty water on the floor after I've turned it off when I'm done using it. Thats only happened twice though and I've used it a lot. I actually feel like my floors are finally clean. I never really felt like with mopping I was getting everything. But this works great. Leaves the floors squeaky clean!"
1,Very disappointed,"I am not a mop person, I hand scrub all of my floors. I feel like Mops just move dirty water around. When the Floormate came out, it looked like it would be a great thing. It would actually scrub my floors and suck the dirty water back up, and I wouldn't have to hand scrub every week.We have 2 large dogs with long hair, and 3 kids under 6. I found the vacuum feature to be completely worthless.Not enough suction, clogs easily. I'd still have to use my regular sweeper first before scrubbing. It just doesn't scrub hard enough. We have a white vinyl floor in the kitchen, and it just doesn't get it sparkling clean. If there is a spot of something grimy on the floor, I have to stand there with the Floormate for afew minutes and keep going over it.I still have the Floormate but rarely use it anymore. It's actually quicker for me to scrub the floors by hand, and they get much cleaner. It's okay for between scrubbing touch ups, but that's about it."
1,Getting rid of it after less than a year,"The Floor Mate seemed like such a great product: my home has hardwood floors and ceramic tile, it is lightweight and it ""easily"" scrubs and squeegies floors dry. Unfortunately, when vacuuming, I have to take the filter outside after every room and shake it and pick the lint/dust out by hand. Not only that, but I have to stop it just as often to take out the dust collection cannister to remove the lint blockage at the screen. I vacuum at least once a week and we are only a family of three. I find that my cleaning time is doubled just trying to get the machine to function like a vacuum should. I am going to sell this in my next garage sale."
2,Don't Buy This Hoover 3000,"This machine is a waste of money. It will never replace a mop.It is only suitable for lightly soiled floors.It won't touch dirty, scuffed and dusty floors.It's cleaner solution is also very expensive, and a small 150 sq. feet kitchen & breakfast area, needs three refills.Its brushing action is pathetic and weak. Its wet pick-up is a joke.Also, it's made very cheaply, with the plastic parts looking as if they came from Toys-R-Us.Buy a powerful steamer.Pass this one by."
2,Not worth the money!,"It will not replace the mop that is for sure. If you want to spend money on something to make your life easier get a maid for a day, at least then you will not feel like you just wasted your money."
1,Unhappy customer,"I purchased a Hoover Floor Mate approximately 6 months ago. It seemed to have difficulty picking up water almost from the start. I thought it was adequate until October, 2004 when my housekeeper informed me she couldn't get it to pick up water at all.I have had a repair service look at it and they say the bearings are shot and the motor needs rebuilding.To say the least I am not happy with this product and thought you should know how your product performed.Unfortunately I do not have the receipt, otherwise I would be asking for a full refund of the $150.00 I spent on the product. It was purchased at a retail store in Lincoln, Nebraska.Sincerely;Regina Klone1610 South 20th StLincoln, Ne 68502"
5,Absolutely love it !!!!!,I was so excited when I got my floor mate and couldn't wait to use it. I have pergo floors and ceramic tile and it worked great. I have 3 kids and 3 dogs so I needed to mop almost daily and hated the thought of first sweeping the floor then mopping it. The best thing is that only clean water is used to clean the floor as opposed to rinsing the mop in the bucket of dirty water and then continuing to mop. I finally feel like my house is clean and sanitized after each use. I highly recommend it. Happy cleaning!!
5,ignore any bad reveiws on the floormate and read directions,This is the best thing right up there with the dishwasher. A+++++ My hardwood floors are almost 50 yrs old and they shine like glass after using the hoover floor mate. I could not get them this clean if I did them on my hands and knees. Now they wont correct scratches but your floors will shine. Just make sure everything is snapped on right when using the machine and vacume first and then empty then wash floors. Very important to make sure fillter is free from dirt so it does not block air flow. LOVE MY FLOORMATE! HURRAY NO MORE BUCKET>
2,A good idea poorly executed,"The Hoover Floormate seems like a good idea, but does not quite perform up to expectations. To avoid excess water forming on sealed wood floors, you must continually turn off the brushes when moving forward and then turn them on again when pulling back. Otherwise, pools of water can form and potentially damage the floor. Plus, I found that the soft brushes did not remove some of the stains and scuff marks on the floor. On a positive note, the cleaners that come packed with the unit have a nice smell, but replacements may be hard to find."
3,Still Learning how to use it - so far OK,"Just had the machine for a week - I thought it would do a better job of vaccumming the hard floor, any way it does get the job done. Takes a bit of getting use to, as one does not see much water on the floor during its use. I am also skepticle about how long the product will last and what type of maintenance cost are involved for the filter and new brushes. I tried it on my painted basement (cement floor) - cleaned ok - it did not manage to get all the dirt off - about as good as a mop or 'swiffer'. It beats a 'swiffer' though on a pergo floor - we have a large pergo floored kitchen, dining room and entrance. The machine also makes a hell of a lot of noise."
2,Cumbersome and overpriced. Save your money.,"Cord is too short. Handle does not fold down far enough to reach under tables. Dirty water reservoir is cumbersome to open and empty and does not hold enough. Be prepared to spill dirty, nasty water all over the clean place while trying to remove the top of the dirty reservoir. Clean solution tank doesn't hold enough to do my kitchen in one fill. Brushes do not reach grout in the ""valleys"" between tiles. I sometimes have to push on the base with my foot to get some ""elbow grease."" On/Off switch is located on side, it should be located on handle making it cumbersome to operate among 4 switches total. This machine is an engineering flop. I regret buying this product. Hopefully Hoover would consider redesigning this one, or drop the criminal price for the product dramatically. If it worked well, I'd see the price fit. Maybe I just have too much house for this dinky machine."
4,Hoover H3000 Floor Mate Hard-Floor Cleaner,This product works very well for mopping the floor. It does take some more work when trying to clean up spills that have dried on the floor.
2,hardwood floors are smeary & streaky,"It did a good job at dry vac on my hardwood floors, but the wet scrub and wet vac left my floors very smeary, streaky and dull. It really looked terrible. It's also pretty slow going - you have to go over each area several times to feel like dirt has been picked up. I'm returning it, hoping to find a good hard floor vacuum to replace it and go back to bucket & rags for wet cleaning."
1,a mop would be easier,I could not have been more disappointed with this product. I have mostly hard wood floors and some ceramic tile. I was first surprised by how hard it was to push - I felt like I was pushing something very heavy. The scrubbers do not work. I have toddlers so I often have sticky juice spills etc.. and the area was still sticky and still spotty even after I went over a spot several times. A mop would have taken much less effort and done a much better job.
2,Job too large for the machine,"Purchased late in 2001 for cleaning Porcelain Tile (approx 1300 sq. ft.). Was trying to improve over using sponge mop. Solution container and pick up container too small. Round bristles used for scrubbing leave swirles that can be seen after floor is completely dry.The current process I have settled on necessitates dispensing cleaning solution and scrubbing with Hoover scrubber (70's vintage, pickup no longer works) then using floormate to pickup solution and dry floor. It does a nice drying job.I now realize, I probably should have purchased a new F5300 floor scrubber instead of the floormate, but it's hard to justify now that I have the floormate machine setting there. If I had kept the box, I would have tried to resell it. It would probably do a fine job on a small ceramic or tiled floor."
3,un-impressed,"Ok, so it works. But it wasn't easy, and it took alot longer than a broob and the wet swiffer/grabit type thing I'g been using. Cleanup of the tanks was a pain, and pretty messy. The dry pick up not as good as my dustbuster, and I don't think the wet pickup after scrubbing should really qualify as ""Drying"" the floor. This is NOT a three-in-one vaccumes as it scrubs as it dries. Its three steps that you can do with one machine, and since step one (vaccume) doesn't work very well, I'll be using my two step: sweep then swiffer. Much less time and cleanup."
1,Failing grade in all subjects,"A multitude of problems:1) the humidity readings never go above 25% even in a bathroom with a hot shower running,2) unit shuts off regularly in the middle of the night3) small water tank relative to overall size of the machine, and4) very expensive relative to machines that do the same job with less lights."
1,Another Pc. Of Crap from Hoover,I don't know what I was thinking. I had all kinds of problems with my Hoover vacuum and then I was crazy enough to try their Floor Mate. Hoover is consistent though... all their products are poorly made and fail to deliver the performance promised.THIS IS THE LAST HOOVER PRODUCT I WILL EVER BUY. Now whenever I hear that Hoover name I will connect it with cheap products that fall apart. HOOVER = JUNK.
2,Not so great. :(,"The one thing I DO like about the FloorMate is that you're not constantly mopping with already-used (aka dirty) water. HOWEVER... I find both the wet and dry pick-up to be, well, nonexistent (this thing doesn't suck up ANYTHING). In addition, the scrubbing brushes don't seem to touch the floor enough to be effective (does anyone possibly know of an adjustment I could make, here? Is there some kind of Hoover secret to operating this thing?). I find that after going over a dirty spot on the floor several times with the FloorMate, I am STILL required to clean the spot by hand. What's the point?"
4,Hoover Floormate,I love it! It does an incredible job on wood floors and just as well on vinyl (although it doesn't dry the vinyl quite as well). I will never use a mop again!
5,Great on tile-I'm a fan.,"I've had my floor-mate for about 6 months. It does an excellent job. I did not think so at first, because it was not picking up water at all (as noted in some of the other reviews). I discovered that there was a cardboard protective insert that needed to be removed. After that it worked great. Floors are almost completely dry with one or two passes. I live in FL and we have a lot of sand and tile. This machine does a great job with both. You can really tell how good it is when you empty the holding tank. Even after vacuming with my &quot;real&quot; V-cleaner, the tank has lots of sand and dirty water. Even picks up dog-hair. The Lysol floor cleaner has a great smell too. If you have a lot of tile or sealed hard-wood, this is a must have. Much better than pushing dirty water around with a standard mop and bucket."
1,hmmm,"I bought this because cleaning my tile floors is a dreaded task. This machine works for VERY superficial cleaning; otherwise, it seems like you'd practically need to stand on where the brushes are, because they don't touch the floor. I have read similar reviews, but because there are so many positive reviews I bought it anyway. It was a waste of money."
3,"Leaks a bit, but cleans well","If you're willing to wrangle with it a bit and you can accept water leaking from the reservoir (the valve is faulty), then it does do a good job of washing the floors. We sweep with a broom first, then dry vacuum, then wash.NOTE: The valve leaked because I used a vinegar solution. I'm not happy that this caused the little gasket to deteriorate, but if you use just water or approved liquid, then it's fine."
3,Check your ceramic tile type first....,"before you buy this product. I haven't been happy at all with it's cleaning capabilities on my ceramic tile. I have textured tile, and it doesn't seem to really get in there and clean, and the water doesn't look to be distributing well, either. On my laminate wood, it works fine.Overall, I am a bit disappointed in this product. I bought a mop to do my ceramic tile, and I've found a broom still works best to get up the dust, etc. I only use it for one room."
1,Complete Disappointment,I bought this Hoover H3000 Floor Mate Hard Floor Cleaner bec/ of the raving reviews I read about it. I am amazed and cannot help but wonder if this has an evil twin that looks the same... but isn't?This did NOT pick up anything with the vac pick up feature. I don't think dust would have easily been picked up. This appliance did not clean good at all and was more trouble to clean and put up than it was to use. I wouldn't have minded more trouble putting away... IF a great job was done... but that wasn't the case.I GAVE mine to my sister and she seems to have the same view I do of it!Great disappointment and I took the only gift money I had to buy it:( This was when they first came out so maybe changes have been made.
5,Hoover Floor Mate,I compared prices for this product and found the pricing at Amazon.com to be extremely lower than elsewhere. I received the product in a short time and was extremely pleased with the product. I would highly recommend this product to others and have already done so to family members.
5,Three kids and two dogs...I needed this!,"I bought this cleaner as a Christmas gift to myself. I have 3 kids; the youngest is 2 months old. With 2 black labs, the pergo floors need to be done daily...not easy when you have a baby strapped to you! My floors were always a mess. I knew I had to get SOMETHING...baby will be crawling in a few months! This cleaner is easy to do with a baby strapped on...just plug it in and go. It does a good job of cleaning the floors; better than I would do without it! I will list my ""nitpicks"" because some people like to know the bad, no matter how small! 1) Location of on/off switch; you have to bend to reach it 2) Does not pick up larger debris (dirt clods, a coffee bean) 3)Noise (this is not really too bothersome, but it is loud). I do love this product, though, and am not willing to do without it again!Every once in awhile, I go visit the Dooney and Bourke purse I wanted to buy myself...but this was the right choice! We all have to be grownups sometimes...!"
3,Waste of money,"I bought this a few years ago and was very excited about it when I purchased it. It was only used a few times and now it collects dust. I am not impressed with it. As far as the sweeping feature goes, most vacuums can clean hard floors now. So really it just mops for you and the amount of steps you have to do to get it to work and clean up after, doesn't make it worth it. I also didn't feel like it did that great of a job of cleaning either. It didn't live up to the hype."
5,GREAT,"We just purchased the Hoover Floor Mate and LOVE it. What a wonderful machine. Dry vacuum picked up all the crumbs, dog hair, etc. The scrub brushes cleaned the floor perfectly and sucked up the left over water/solution so the floors were dry in under 2 min. The included Lysol cleaning solution leaves behind a fresh clean scent. I was amazed how dirty the water was and we mop at least once a week. Clean up of the tanks could not have been easier. No more bucket and mop for me!!"
1,Manilow warned me that it sucks,"This product sure tells a good story BUT...I ended up selling mine in a garage sale for $5!!! Not only did it not perform as promised, when I tried to clean the dirt sucked into the roller area, I couldn't get it out. Then it started making a squealing noise every time I turned it on. Hoover has lost their TRIED AND TRUE product status with me. This brand name will be the LAST one I look at for future purchases."
2,Where's the scrubbing?,"We have two dogs that track their muddy paws all over the house. We have both wood floors and linoleum. I thought this vacuum would be the answer to mopping and scrubbing. I agree with other reviewers that the scrub brushes don't seem to quite reach the floor, so they're useless. You're better off using a regular vaccum, broom, scrub brush, mop, etc. The only good thing I can say about this is that it does vacuum up water, so I usually use it when the dogs tip over their water bowl."
2,Not worth it,"Purchased to clean our real wood floors. Performance was quite poor. This Floormate did no better job than a regular mop. In addition, the scrubbers left marks on the wood. I had to use our ""Swiffer"" to clean up the marks. The general idea is good. It's lightweight, easy to add the solution and easy to empty.For the money, your much better off purchasing a $25 Swiffer - it does a better job."
2,Don't buy it,"The Hoover Floor Mate doesn't work well on tile floors, as the brushes don't reach the grout. The tanks are difficult to remove when emptying. The filter clogs with dust very easily. The water tank on mine began to leak after I used it only six times. Don't buy this product if you have tile floors. A big disappointment! In fact, don't buy this product."
2,More trouble than it's worth,"This is a good idea but it could be so much better. The tanks are small so plan on several trips to the sink to dump and refill for each room. Consider this inconvenience if you have floors to clean that are not near a bathroom. The solution is quickly used up so have more on hand before you start. This machine is not for deep cleaning. Despite many repeat applications, heavily soiled grout did not come clean. The cord is long but I couldn't keep it out of my way. I would like bigger tanks, bigger brushes that clean uneven surfaces, a low-suds cleaning solution, and a switch to release the handle in a more convenient spot. Smooth tile was easy to clean but uneven surfaces and grout required lots more effort. ..."
2,Floor Mate manufacture upgrades,"All in all a good machine, but I have found that I need an accessory of a harder scrubbing brush. It poorly scrubs and sucks rubber knobbed flooring and poorly cleaned my grouted ceramic tile. Also wished it had a larger tank capacity."
2,Just Don't Get it Clogged!!!!!,"This thing does a good job of cleaning floors, but watch out if you get it clogged. The moment it gets clogged it immediately dumps dirty water and clumps of dirt and hair all over your floor. As an experienced floor mate user I can anticipate when it gets clogged, grab it, sprint to the sink and dump it out. Every time you use you need to disassemble it and clean it out, because this thing has a million nooks and crannys that can get clogged. So basically it does a good job of cleaning the floor when it isn't busy dumping dirty water everywhere."
1,Broken and moldy!,"The ultrasonic disk stopped working after two months of nightly use. No amount of cleaning with vinegar (as recommended) made it work again. I tried to fully dry it out, but four different kinds of mold grew on various parts of the unit! So much for the nanosilver. Don't waste your money."
2,doesnt suck,cleans fine but it doesnt suck up the water likes its supposed to. All it does is push the dirty water around the floor so I end up on my knees with paper towels cleaning up puddles.Hey at least it pools it for me.....but definetly not worth the money for that!
5,Surpassed My Expectations,"This is one of the best things I have bought. Not only does this cleaner scrubs efficiently, but it dries incredibly fast - literally within seconds with the dry mode. You push it like a vacuum cleaner on floors, but it is lighter and easier to push. You can use it on hardwood. I used it on my hardwood floor, and it felt smooth and polished afterwards. Very helpful for anyone with a back or hand injury or a messy dog/pet!"
5,Love my floormate- after I learned how to use it!,"I have textured tile, and the Floormate cleaned it very well. I don't think it scrubs the grout all that well, but a mop doesn't either. The grout needs to be scrubbed by hand either way, and that is NOT a weekly job. With regards to the Floormate, the only advice I would offer is to only squeeze the solution trigger when pushing forward, (I used up a whole tank of solution in 5 minutes before I realized this) and then use a back and forth motion to scrub the area. It does pick up the sticky spots if you give it a chance! I definitely recommend the Floormate to anyone looking to make their floor cleaning easier, less messy, and dare I say- enjoyable!"
3,Glad to have it!,"I have 5 fairly large dogs, & the house we bought 2 years ago has a white kitchen floor. The dogs track dirt all over the house, but of course it's most noticeable on that floor (which we are replacing very soon!). We bought the Floormate, & overall, I like it a lot. It does take more time than I'd like to clean the floor (our kitchen is very large), & the vacuum part is not the best (clogs rather easily). I use hot water in the solution & it works wonderfully. The Floormate also works nicely on our hard wood flooring."
2,Very very dissapointed,"For many years, I owned a Hoover floor washer and it was great.Apparently the team that created that machine has retired and burned the specs.I was extremely dissapointed in this machines ability to clean."
1,Better get yourself a mop and broom.,"I am very disappointed with this machine! There is too little suction to consider it a good vacuum, and the brushes are not set low enough to allow the system to ""mop"" well enough. I found myself spending twice the time vacuuming - having to go over the same area over and over again. And washing the floor was a joke. All the FloorMate did was spray cleaner out and suck it back up - where is the scrubbing step?? Your money is better spent on a lightweight vacuum with good suction and new mop!"
2,GREAT WHILE IT LASTED,"We used it all the time, it was handy and easy to use. Did clean really well.For the record, this unit failed after two years and had to throw it away. I am changing my rating from 5 stars to 2 for lack of durability"
1,Buy a Mop,"Most reviews for this item suggest moderate expectations.Mine were simply to clean a small new kitchen floor.The unit does not function well in the ""vac"" mode and is equally poor in the ""scrub"" mode.A good broom and mop work far better."
1,Pass this up! Don't waste your money,"I have always wanted one since we have ceramic tile and laminate wood floors. My husband got me one and I was excited. Boy was I wrong in wanting this product. The scrubbing is not all it's cracked up to be, the suction sucks-or in this case, doesn't really suck and is poor. It did not suck up the water in the grout lines in my tile floor, so what's the point? I am returning it and also returning to using my swiffer and broom vac-takes the same amount of time using muscle compared to filling and emptying the unit. JUNK!"
2,Dissapointing,"I purchased this because I have laminate and tile flooring all through my house and I was tired of lugging a mop and bucket. This machine was very dissapointing because 1) the cord is so long it get in the way, 2) it doesn't hold much water so it constantly needs to be refilled/emptied, and 3) it drips water everywhere. All in all I wish I had my money back so I could invest in a good hard floor vacuum and go back to just mopping."
1,Doesn't Work,"My husband and I bought the Floor Mate after quite a bit of research to use on our linoleum floors. We were so excited when we brought the Floor Mate home. It was very easy to put together and very easy to operate. However, we soon noticed that the Floor Mate just didn't work. It didn't scrub our floors at all. It would lay down cleaning solution and just suck it up. I would have to make numerous passes over dirty spots to get them up (if they even came up at all). Because I was continually making numerous passes over the dirty areas, I went through the cleaning solution very quickly. The sample bottle (8oz) was used up the first time we used the Floor Mate to clean our kitchen. It's quicker for me to just vacuum the floors and then mop them the old fashioned way. I wish the Floor Mate would have worked better than advertised. I hate mopping my floors, but for now, it seems to be the best way to get them clean."
2,Where's the scrubbing action???,"If you have a floor that is already mostly clean...as in a Swiffer WetJet could make it nice, then the Hoover Floormate will make it just as nice PLUS dry the floor as you go.However, if you have a dirty linoleum laundry room that a dog calls home, this product will do nothing for you! I got my floormate last night and immediately went to work on the floor. I saw no change in the dingy color so I tried going slowly; I tried ""soaking"" some spots; I tried everything.Finally I got on my hands and knees and stuck my fingers under the rotating brushes while they were on. It felt time a soft-bristled toothbrush on my hand!!I ended up scrubbing the floor with a scrub brush on my hands and knees and got it sparkling white in about 45 minutes. I used the Floormate to suck up the suds and dirty water that was left on the floor as that is all it is good for.I will be returning it promptly!!!"
2,A little bit better than a vacuum and a Swiffer,"Based on a couple of the glowing reviews I'd read here, I expected more. It's an ok machine. It's far from a professional piece of equipment, but I suppose the price reflects that.Pro: It dries the floor quite well; light weight.Con: Small cleaning fluid reservoir, requiring relatively frequent attention; brushes don't scrub hard enough, and don't reach down to grout; I'd like it if the cleaning foot were wider; doesn't handle much dog hair before needing to be cleaned out; yet another piece of equipment to store.I'd give it a ""C"", but I have to admit -- I'm keeping it. My wood floors aren't as clean as I'd like when I'm done with the Floor Mate, but they're pretty clean."
2,Flawed Design!,"Overall I like this item, however there is a serious flaw in the design that makes me less likely to use it on a regular basis. I also would not buy another one unless this flaw was fixed. The receptacle that holds the dirty water is the culprit. It is near impossible to remove the lid; you will struggle and struggle until your fingers are sore. It is frustrating and just overall a poor design. I don't understand how Hoover could have overlooked this obvious problem. If you buy one of these, the first time you use it and attempt to clean out the collection receptacle, you will certainly recognize the serious problem."
5,LOVE IT!!!,We are overseas and have white tile floors... this cleans it so well... you need sunglasses to look at the floor... my neighbor recommended it and I found it at the local base exchange and was so worth the price... no more mop and broom!!!
4,mom crazy about clean floors,I love my floormate i have had it for 6 months and it is awesome!!! Gave it the damp cloth test and it was clean!!! My floor was never clean like that after I had mopped. even when I mopped the floor several times. I usually use just hot water and works btter than bleach. I recommend it highly. Only one complaint it is a vac so it doesn't get the nooks and crannies so every now again you have to get on your knees and clean aroung the baseboard.
4,Works for me (and I got a bargain!),"I saw the tail end of the infomercial, and thought it looked like what I needed. I live in Waikiki, and sand and dust are always getting tracked in. I found the vacuum sufficient to pick up the dirt before I started scrubbing. I found that if I released the solution while pushing the machine forward, wait a few seconds and then pull the unit SLOWLY back over the dirty solution, it works well...I think the unit is primarily made to keep floors clean, not to strip a floor that doesn't get regular cleaning. I like to walk barefoot, and having nice clean floors is wonderful!"
4,Better than mop and bucket,Product doesn't vacuum very good. But it more than makes up for this by cleaning and sucking up the dirty water. No more buckets of dirty water to swirl on the floor. My floors haven't looked so well in ages.
4,It's worth it!,"I know it's alot of money but if you have 2 children and a husband that tracks mud through the kitchen daily, you will be pleased with this product! I never liked mops because they never seemed to do a good enough job on the floor. I always got on my hands and knees to wash the floor which usually took me about 1 1/2 hours (I have a big kitchen). I was skeptical about this product but I was also tired of getting sore knees. So, I took a chance and I was very pleased! I doesn't seem to get rid of really tough stains but it does get rid of the everyday grime!"
3,I have one complaint....,"The Hoover Floor Mate is, by all accounts, a pretty good little machine with seemingly good intentions. The only problem I've found with it is that when the brush attachment is on, it doesn't touch the floor. The wheels seem to be lower than the brushes, so I have to step on the front of the Mate to lower the brushes to the floor. I've looked all over it to see if I'm doing something wrong, and I don't know if others are having the same problem, but it's renders the whole scrubbing aspect of this machine useless. Other than that, it vacuums like a dream--both wet and dry, which is super nice if you or someone you love has a habit of dropping liquids!"
2,Not as good,"I purchased the Hoover Floor Mate when my old Hoover floor cleaner gave up the ghost. The old model was so extremely efficient I did not think I could live without it. Unfortunately, this new Floor Mate is not as good as the original. While it does put down cleaning solution and vacuum it up, it does not clean. I have all tile flooring. The majority of it is textured. The brushes of the Floor Mate are permanently set in position so only the raised relief portion of the floor was cleaned and I had to get down on my hands and knees to clean the lowered part of the tile pattern. If you have perfectly flat floors, it will probably work. It didn't for me and I returned the machine. It is a shame that Hoover replaced a perfect floor cleaning machine with an inferior product."
1,Very disappointed,"I have read with puzzlement some of the excellent reviews of this product, as my experience has been just the opposite. The product does not clean, does not pick up dirt well, and tends to simply smear dirt over the floor. It is cumbersome to use and the cleaning product refills are expensive and hard to find. I've used the machine 3 times now and each time I get angry with myself for purchasing it."
1,Does not work,"I really tried to like this machine. I liked the idea of not having to mop anymore, but it just doesn't work. It squirts water on the floor and picks it up, but the brushes barely touch the floor and it's no good at all for removing marks of any kind. If there is anything sticky on the kitchen floor, forget it. In addition, you have to run over the spot you just squirted the water on several times to pick up all the water, so it's very time consuming. I can get out my old-fashioned sponge mop and get the job done in half the time."
1,I wouldn't want this if it were FREE,"This machine was a huge disappointment. First of all, there's hardly any suction to vacuum dry debis. I ended up using my regular carpet vacuum. Next, it doesn't scrub. I went over dried spilled coffee 8 times before it disappeared. Tougher stains I had to remove by hand. The so called sqeegee does a lousy job of picking up the dirty water. I ended up drying my floor with a dry mop. This thing is a piece of junk, and I'm packing it up for a return. If I could give this a minus rating, I certainly would."
1,I spent an entire Sun. afternoon cleaning up behind this thing.,"It spins just fine. It scrubs just fine. It puts water all over your $10,000 bamboo floor. And then, it is ""Oh my God"", because it does not pick up the water. When you have to jump and run to buy mops, instead of settling in for your day of rest, the fun went out of that little monster real quick.Hoover will get more of these back, but 95% of people will just quietly quit using the things and never report what a flimsy little, plastic, snap together, made in China, farce this thing is."
5,Easy and Quick Helper for me and my family,"This vaccuum is simply put the best! Not only does it comes from a great reputation from Hoover, it saves the problem of having to use a broom, then get a mop and bucket to clean your floors. It's simple and so easy to use, with out all the mess involved with having to put water in a bucket, mop then empty the bucket. My niece was over this weekend, and cleaned my kitchen floor spotless with this vaccuum, she's only 7. That's how easy it is to use. With one button you can change it to vaccuum, or mop, and it comes with cleaning bottles to clean that you just pop in the the vaccuum. If you are looking for a high quality vaccuum at a great price, then this is the one you are looking for."
1,Pathetic....... Don't buy !!!,"I bought the Hoover H3000 Floor Mate as I have hardwood floor and Tile in my house. Like a ""smart"" buyer I read thu all Amazon reviews on the product. Some of them did caution me against this product. I guess when you are favourably predisposed towards something, positive reinforcement has a mutiplier effect.I should have heeded to the bad review.Bad product. Doesn't even vacuum properly. Too complicated to operate, with 2 kinds of fluids. I think the biggest drawback is that before you use the scrubber, the floor has to be completely clean. Which, unfortunately is not possible as this product is unable to perform even simple vacuum fuction. Pile of dust, debris remains inspite of moving the machine over it multiple times.Do yourself a favor. Do not buy it."
3,Big waste of money,"The solution tank is too small, it sucks up water even while it's scrubbing, thus never having enough water to do a real job of cleaning...i carry a bottle of solution to throw along ahead of the machine to get some real cleaning done. The up-suction is nice, if you have a perfectly level floor (I don't). This is what I get for wanting things to be too easy :+)"
3,misc usages,"brushes are too soft, and works best on flat surfaces. didnt think it was worth buying for the uneven floors I was hopeing to use it on. Wish the sucction would stop during scrub process, would make the scrubbing quicker, and use of cleaning solution less."
3,5 Stars for Mopping 1 Star for Vacuuming,"Having a golden retriever, my hardwood floors can get to looking like carpet in no time. The vacuum feature really is not cut out to handle pet hair. I use my vacuum to pick up the dog hair and then use the floormate to scrub the floor. I use a hot water and vinager solution, which leaves the floors looking great. One of the best features is the ability for the floormate to pick-up the majority of the cleaning solution leaving the floor virtually dry. One downfall is the small size of the water reservoirs. I typically need to stop and add solution or empty the dirty water receptacle 3 - 4 times when cleaning my kitchen/living room area."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought the Floor Mate because 95% of the flooring in my house is hard surface. It has been a great disappointment to me because it is so hard to use and doesn't do a very good job. I cannot use it on the hardwood floors because I am afraid water might get down under them (they are very old - about 150 years old - but have been refinished recently.) I have a cat so have to stop and empty the recovery tank every few minutes because the cat hair clogs the filter. It doesn't mop well and doesn't suck up the water well at all. I find the recovery tank very difficult to get off and put back on. All in all, it is a very poorly designed appliance. I wish I could take it back where I bought it, but I have had it for six to eight months, even though I have only used it three times. I sent a letter of complaint to the Hoover Company but didn't receive an acknowledgement from them that the got (and read) my letter."
2,Not what you expect,"The Hoover Floor-Mate is not what you expect. It will NOT do a decent job of cleaning tile floors (I dont know about linoleum). You will still have to mop and hand scrub marks.However, It does do an excellent job of vacuuming up the mop water, leaving the floor almost completely dry.In my opinion, that is NOT worth the expense. I'm sending mine back."
4,"Works Ok, but overpriced","The floormate works Ok. I'm still trying to decide if I like it. I think that it's a little overpriced for the mediocre job that it does. It's not a good floor vac (get a shark cordless sweeper, it's excellent), but it's a pretty good mop, and I do like the way it dries the floor instantly (it saves the 18th month old from slipping all over the floor while I clean them since he has to be right under me...which any toddler mom would appreciate). It doesn't scrub very well (but it doesn't bother me to spot clean a few stubborn spots), but it does get a lot of dirt up. I'm just apalled at the dirty water after doing one room! So my recommendation would be to either wait for the price to come down or the next model (let Hoover work out it's little issues, like not scrubbing well)."
5,Better than sandwich bread,"I predict this machine will become as integral to running a household as a washing machine. It is fabulous. It does exactly what I bought it to do. I bought it to clean ceramic and hardwood floors. It is lightweight and very easy to fill and empty. I love it. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that I hate housework and I am not a cleanfreak."
5,This is a review for the H3010 longer cord plus extra brushs,New up grade of the H3000. I needed the longer cord plus it has 2 brush blocks and two filters. Only problem I've had with this product is to put it together correctly and no problems. If you load the cleaning solution with out the slide button on handle in the down positions get ready for leaking water and no suction. My fault. Also when put away make sure the same button is on dry/wet setting or it will leak cleaning solution onto floor. Something omitted in details of instruction. This is a powerful machine and did a wonderful job on my tile floor. Easy to pull apart and clean. Can't believe the dirt it pulled up off my floors. This is a quality product. Anyone having leaking problems or lack of suction is their fault for not putting it together properly.
2,Great for smooth surface floors,"Most of my tile floors are textured, and I'm disappointed at the Floor Mate's performance on them. The brushes aren't deep enough to get into the grooves, and the grout doesn't get clean.Since this is a Hoover, I thought the quality would be a lot better. I have had this cleaner for four months, and already the liquid release is not working correctly. And, there are no Hoover Factory repair depots near me, and no vacuum repair outfits work are authorized to work on Hoover products.Also, the cleaners cannot be found in the rural area where I live.If the quality were better, I could recommend this for smooth surfaces."
5,Toss out your mops...,"This device does it all. It vacuums up debris on your hard floors, it then mops and scrubs, and finally with a switch of a button it dries your floor. Since the majority of my floors are laminated, this by far is the easiest thing to use on the floors. The proof of its cleaning abilities are right in the containers. It even picks up dog and cat hair."
4,Slow & Easy,"I just received the FloorMate as a gift and like it very much. I found that the old mopping/scrubbing motion does not work as well as letting the machine do the work, by moving it slow & easy (which is much easier on your back). I have a tile in my entry, kitchen, hall & bathroom that looks like stone. Unlike smooth tile, the texture likes to hold onto dirt, making it harder to clean. The FloorMate did a good job, but it took longer than hand scrubbing and I had to empty & refill it several times. Now that I have the hang of it, however, it shouldn't take as long next time I use it. I had to order more cleaner direct from Hoover, as the local retailers in our small town do not carry it. Hopefully, as more people get this machine, retailers will start carrying the cleaner for them."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time.,"I've had mine for quite awhile, and while I am happy with the way it cleaned the floors it just isn't made well.About 6 months ago a plastic piece on the bottom broke. We replaced that. Now it doesn't have any suction.I do really expect appliances I buy to last more than 18 months. This didn't even last that long without needing a repair.So now I'm in the market for something made a little better and I'm willing to pay the price. I hate leaving dirty water on the floor I'm thinking about just getting a little wet/dry vac."
4,Sure beats mopping!,"My kitchen floor always seemed dirty, even though I generally used a Ready-Mop on it every couple days. My kids' white socks still got that gross shade of tannish-grey on the bottoms!I finally got tired of that and bought a Floor Mate, and I'm VERY glad. The first time I used it, the machine got an amazing amount of built-up dirt off of my floor. The water in the used solution tank was embarrassingly dingy! The Floor Mate continues to perform very well at our house and I'm glad I got it. I've read other reviews that list minor ""cons"" of the product, but they certainly don't outweigh the benefits of a freshly-scrubbed floor without having to get down on my hands & knees with my scrub brush and bucket. I'd definitely recommend the Floor Mate."
2,all hipe!,"... I used the thing one time (on Linolium and Terrazo) and have decided to return it. I don't think the benefits outweigh the downfalls. It was easy to put together and was not heavy, it was easy to use, however it did not take scuffs off the floor and it took 3 times as long to clean the floor. I have read reviews about people altaring the machine to make it work better but for [this much money] it should work straight from the box!Hope this helps"
1,Lacking in humor,"I guess it takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy these stories, but I did not. The ""humor"" relies on un-funny dialogue and boring characters. Sometimes, even if something isn't funny, I will at least applaud it for being entertaining. This is not the case with Pendarvis. Most of the stories are immature-sounding without being funny at all and lack any attention to pacing or scene setting."
4,Read Through Hands Over Eyes,"What a funny book! Pendarvis' characters are so real they are almost uncomfortable to read! Just like watching someone do something you KNOW is terribly stupid: You want to warn them, you want to look away but yet you keep on watching to see what will happen next.Very few books make me laugh out loud, but this one did. And unlike the Amazon editorial, I enjoyed ""My High, Squeaky Voice"". Literary genius? No. But how often do you come across an opening paragraph that reads ""People love my high, squeaky voice. What's not to love? It's high and it's squeaky. And it is mine. I love the way God made me.""No pretention here! Just a great belly-laugh of a book!"
1,Don't buy this book,"Rock Climbing Washington has the worst pictures, many mistakes and is plain useless at best, dangerous at worst as a guide book. I contributed the section on the Potholes climbing area and after see the results I am extremely sorry that I did it. To anyone that wants to climb in the Potholes I will provide descent pictures so you can find the routes. I sent Jeff Smoot extremely crisp black and white photographs and the extremely poor publishing of Falcon press messed them up. If this is the best that Falcon press can do, I plan to never buy one of their guide books. The section on Frenchman's Coulee is just plain inaccurate. Many of the routes are mis-rated or mis-described. It is obvious that Jeff Smoot knows nothing of these areas and has no business ""writing"" (in truth compiling a guide book from the works of others) a guide book to these areas.With Regrets for Ever Being Involved Bill Robins"
1,"Poor pictures, poor topos, inaccuracies, bad style","My title pretty much sums it up. An explanation of my ""bad style"" comment: Smoot compiled (poorly) a bunch of info that he gathered from other guidebooks and local climbers. I don't think he did a lot of personal research, becuase many of his topos are very inaccurate, so I don't think it's fair of him to make a bunch of money from putting out a poor product that relies heavily on other people's work.I recommend ""Weekend Climbs"" by David Whitelaw (Mountaineers Press) as an alternative. Although it omits most climbs over 5.10, it has accurate beta, excellent pictures and topos, and covers pretty much all of the rock climbing areas in the state.BTW, I do not get any money from the sales of Weekend Climbs, I just think it's a better book and D.W. is a cooler guy than J.S."
4,WALMART is Cheaper!!,"I have been using this product for several days now, and I do notice a difference. It does involve more muscles, particularly my pectoralis in the front and rhomboids in the back. My favorite feature is that it does not put strain on my wrists, as do normal pushups.However, I gave this a 4 instead of 5 because I think it's twice as expensive on amazon. I bought mine at walmart for $20!!! I'm an avid Amazon shopper and used to think I get the best deal here, but I'm glad I did some comparison shopping."
5,Perfect Push-Up,I have tried several different push-up bars and these are defiantly the Perfect Push-up bars! Good for the shoulders and chest!!!
2,Not what I expected...,I thought this was made out of metal and had some kind of lock or something to rotate the arms in a half circle and I feel like i'm trying to balance myself on the bars.I will say that this has made doing pushups alot harder but I still don't think it's worth $40...
4,Good product but bad price,This product is just what I was looking for. It does all that it is supposed to do and lives up to its expectations. But I found it at Sam's Club for 10 dollars cheaper a couple of weeks later. I should have been more patient.
4,They weren't kidding...,"Review actually provided by Stephen Andrew Lynch, this was a gift for him:Perfect pushups give you a MUCH better workout when doing pushups. Also, they make it very difficult to injure your tendones, etc. due to the natural rotation's tendency to spread the weight across multiple points on the arms. Works more muscle groups. Only complaint: the grips can be a bit hard on the hands after a while."
4,Perfect Pushup,"If you really want to work our chest muscles and arm muscles, then this is the perfect product for you. It is not as easy as it looks. Expect to breath deeply. I would not recommend this for people who have back pain or back difficulties."
4,Sweet,Nice little contraption. It let's me work out when for whatever reason I don't want to/have time to get to the gym.
5,Well worth it if you stick with it,I have been using the perfect push up routinely for almost 2 years and the results have been phenomenal. I went from having to do the push ups from my knees to now having a max of 65 honest to goodness push ups. People have noticed the results and physically I just feel better. I follow the program chart that is provided and only recently started tweaking it because I am doing more push ups than the exercise plans contain. All in all using these and staying with it was one of the best decisions I have made. To anyone still using the original model I find that the V2s have a better feel and are far more sturdy and durable.
5,"Work well, definitely helps the wrists.","Harder to do more reps than normal pushups (a good thing) and contribute to better form due to need to exert more control during rotation. Also the aspect of the chest going lower in the down motion seems to add difficulty.Though I am over sixty, I have exercised most of my life and appreciate these. Someone with little or no conditioning might find them too hard to begin with but definitely will be good as you progress."
5,Great Product!,"I've been using Perfect Pushup for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it! When I first started using it, I could barely do 5 pushups without using my knees; Now after two weeks of sticking to the workout schedule, I can do a complete set (40-50 pushups)! It's only been two weeks but I can already feel a difference in my upper body strength! I highly recommend this product..Remember, if you buy it, stick to the workout schedule, you will be amazed at the increase in your upper body strength within a couple of weeks!"
5,Even lower Walmart Price!!!,"I haven't really used these yet but I did purchase a set from Walmart today for $17.98 instead of the usual $19.99. I'm from NJ but I don't think that it makes any difference since Walmart is Walmart. Even if these are the ""Basic"" model they seem to be very heavy duty and I don't think paying another $20 bucks will really make any difference."
1,"Handles too big, not very stable feeling","I'm 5'10 approx 260lbs, so I need a sturdy device for push ups. I tried these because they were on sale locally and the store I went to didn't have any standard push up bars. I took them back after a day. The handles are too big, you better have a massive sized hand to use these. Not only that, I want stability in my push up bars - these do not feel stable because you can't lock them in place..."
2,"Great idea, cheap quality","I got this product as a gift. The twisting motion does help you work out the right muscles. It's pretty neat. And the grips easily collapse for traveling.However, the craftsmanship is not high quality. It's not worth more than $15 tops. One grip broke just after 2 weeks of use! I'm not a heavy guy at all. And I didn't drop it or knock it around. The lower plate just came off! And since it only comes is pairs, I'll have to buy a new set now."
4,"Good product, a little over priced for what it is.","I broke my thumb/hand playing football. During the cast/recovery period I lost a lot of strength and flexibility in my wrist. I could not support myself while doing pushups because my wrist was so week. I bought this product to help get back in the groove. It allowed me to do pushups with less pressure on my wrists. It works well, but it is overpriced for what it is."
3,"Interesting product, but over priced.","I bought a slight different model of the same product from WalMart for only $19.xx. It has snap on handles, and weight only 3 pounds. I think it's a very interesting product. Very stable on hardwood floor, ceramic tile and carpet. Takes more effort than regular push up, though I am not certain how much can be contributed to this rotation mechanism. You may get similar affects by elevating you hands ( by other means) and feet (putting you feet on step or a chair) and changing position of you hands to target different muscles. My hands actually feel more comfortable when doing push ups on flat surface especially on carpet. When using this device, the pressure is concentrated on smaller area and makes hands feel less comfortable. For the price I paid, I would keep it for while, but I don't think I would pay twice the price for it."
5,It really works,This product really works! It makes sure you are doing push-ups the RIGHT way. I have sent it to two friends as gifts. They loved it too!
3,People with shoulder problems beware!,"I injured my shoulder in 2001, while in high school.Fast forward about six or seven years.I ordered this product and from the moment it arrived used it regularly for about 6 months. I didn't see outstanding results, and I exercise 4 or 5 times a week. I did not see any results I wouldn't normally see with regular pushups. But, it was easy on my wrists, and because it was a big harder I didn't have to do so many, so it was easy on my elbows too.After using for six months I decided to try the advanced movements, which were significantly more difficult, but that's the point. While doing incline pushups, with my feet on a swiss ball, I torn my entire labrum in my shoulder.This product is great for anyone who doesn't like doing regular pushups. This product is awful for anyone with a preexisting, even if it's old, injury. Needless to say I need to have surgery on my shoulder now. Thanks perfect pushup."
1,Wrist Hurter!,"after reading all the reviews about how great this is was for your wrists, I never expected to actually have wrist problemsI never had any issues with my wrists and regular push ups, but using the Perfect Push up caused A LOT of pain in both my wrists! It seems like a good idea and has good motion, and I really did want to enjoy it. However, it definitely caused pain to my wrists, which is not the case with regular push ups."
3,"Not really what I was looking for, but give a great workout . . .","I was looking to get some pushup bars for using with P90X. Someone talked me into get these ones. It seems to be that the Perfect Pushup bars are geared toward the workout that comes with the bars themselves. While I have been using them with P90X, I wish I would have bought bars that do not rotate."
5,Really does take push-ups to a whole new level!,"Our son is in excellent shape and push-ups are a part of his usual routine. But this simple product, designed by a Navy Seal, really does make the usual push-up more challenging and allows the user to vary his or her routine quite a bit. By the way, you can find free workouts online for this, at various video sites, or you can buy one of the DVDs or cards listed below.One warning: Because this DOES allow your arms to rotate, you might consider having someone ""spot"" you the first time, as I've seen inexperienced users lose their balance or have their arms collapse. This is a rarity and should NOT happen if you are in control of your body, have decent balance and are used to push-ups.Related products:Power 10 Workout DVDPerfect Pushup - Power 10 Workout Cards"
4,Less wrist-impact than normal pushup,"I got the Perfect Pushup because I type on the computer all day and play drums.Because of my risk of Carpel Tunnel Syndrome and tendinitis I can't afford to add extra stress to my wrists with exercise, but I like doing pushups.This is great for me because you do not extend your fingers and flatten your palm. Plus, you get the extra motion with the rotation to engage more muscles.My only complaint is it slides a little on a hard floor. Carpet is fine though."
5,WOW! I'm not one for gadgets but this thing is awsome!,I don't have time to go to the gym. I was looking for something different and for the price I figured I would give this a try. Am I glad I spent the money. Best $40 I have ever spent on equipment. The push-up will never be the same. From the first use I could already feel muscles working that you would never feel with a regular push-up. I also have a problem with my wrist which made push-ups painful. With this device I can now do painless push-ups again. When I first got the device I could do about 60 push-ups in two minutes without the device. With the device it drops to about 20. That just shows how much more effort you need to use this device. If you are on the fence on this one I hope my review pushes you to buy it. You will not regret it.
1,"DO NOT purchase through Amazon, see below","Do not purchase through Amazon. Body Rev, the seller, is misrepresenting the product. If you purchase the perfect push-up through a store (i.e. Dicks Sporting Goods) you will pay the same price and receive an instructional DVD and workout chart with the package at no extra charge. I just spoke to Amazon, save yourself some time, go to the store instead. In no way is this review giving the product itself a 1 star, do not buy from this seller."
5,Actually Works,"I have had the Perfect Pushup for about 3 months and it actually works. I have completed the 21 day ""Get Ripped Ripped"" routine twice increasing in the total number of pushups, there has been a noticable difference. People comment all the time that they didn't realize I was muscular. This has been one of my best purchases."
4,Easy Purchase,The order was placed and the correct product was delivered with no hidden surprises. Can't ask for anything else!
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT!!!!!,"Absolutely horrible customer service. Never received the product & two months later I'm still trying to get my money back. Thinking about starting a class action... thats how bad it is. They straight out robbed me. And while admitting to not delivering the product, refuse to give me back my money. They're still telling me to call back next week & they'll see what they can do. My boyfriend got his though. I guess delivery is by the luck of the drawl"
4,A new twist on the push up!,"For all of you out there looking to add something to your work out then this product might be for you. I use it to supplement my weight training to keep my workout fresh. As for the quality and feel of the product. It is quite comfortable to do regular push ups, close hand push ups, wide arm push ups, and elevated push ups. The handles are padded and comfortable. Like most reviews I have had read; I too would say at first it is awkward until you learn how to use them the right way. It does work different muscles in your arms and does not hurt your wrist. I would highly recommend this product to those who do not have access to a gym or anyone who want to keep their workout fresh."
4,Great workout,We find these enhance push up workouts by using muscles that normally do not get involved in pushups. Good piece of eqmt- does not require a lot of space to store or use.
5,Perfect Pushup,"I thought this was going to be another hoaky fitness product, but I am very impressed. Although the perfect pushup looks easy, you are in for a surprise. It is much harder that it looks and gives you a much better workout than regular pushups. After doing these your pecks will feel just like you did a 3 sets of bench. I also love the workout chart that comes with it. This is an awesome product!"
4,good product,i really like the product. It makes a lot of muscles get involved during the push ups due to its rotating mechanism.
4,Added level of difficulty,"As usual, I was a bit skeptical but caved into the impulse purchase and I was pleasantly surprised. These do add a fluid motion to pushups and make them more difficult (in a good way). I found that i can only do about half as many pushups with them, but the deeper dip makes for a good burn. Ive added them to my daily routine for a month now and am happy with my purchase."
5,great workout,i get a good workout with every use and you can fell the differance when doing regular pushups
5,"hate pushups? I did too, but no more","whoever thought a product on an infomercial could actually be good? I always wanted to do pushups, but hated the strain it put on my wrists. The rotation action on these badboys solves that, and you go deep into the motion, but its very natural and painless now.I cannot emphasize how impressed I was the first time I used these. Included is a sheet that tells you what kind of exercises you can do, and how many reps you can do. Let me tell you, I had such a good workout the first time, my entire upper body was in pain for days. It was like going to the gym for the first time again. These things work, they are comfortable, easy to use, and really deliver the perfect pushup. A must have for any home gym."
2,TO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET,"THE PERFECT PUSH UP IT IS TO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET,ALSO IT IS TO BIG.IT SHOULD BE MORE COMPACT.IT IS OK PRODUCT.WALMART HAS IT FOR $19.00,THE SAME PRODUCT,THIS IS A FAIR PRICE."
3,Perfect Push-Up,You can do push-ups on the floor. This is not worth the money. It is good for keeping your hands off of the dirty floor though.
2,"Okay, not great","It's so-so, you can definitely feel it working. But it's pretty repetitive and there are only a couple different ways you can use it, so it gets boring very quickly. If you're like me it will end up being just another piece of junk in your closet."
4,Amazon is overpriced,"Excellent equipment, but amazon is ripping us off...i just saw the same perfect pushup at Walmart for $19.99..Check your local walmart before paying $20 more for the perfect pushup."
3,Paid too much for Perfect Push-up,"After I had received delivery of the Perfect Push-up set there were numerous ads in our local newspapers for the identical item at 1/2 the cost. There were at least 3 major retailers in our area selling this item for $19.99 just before Christmas. Since return postage would have been costly, I felt forced to keep these even though they were twice the retail of those I could have purchased locally."
4,Built to perfection....,"Its the new ultimate body push up. Light weight yet sturdy. I have used it for 2 weeks now (5 times a week) and noticed some bulk building up specifically on my chest, shoulders and triceps. Im lovin it!!! the only draw back i could think is the GUIDE exercise instructions which i found a little less lacking. In general, great stuff....James"
5,Effective and solid,"Works as advertised. Deeper dips, smooth motion, harder work out. If anyone was wondering, it works fine on carpet. Feels solid."
5,Very good product,"Comfortable, and provide an excellent pump. Surprisingly durable as well with a good warranty.The exercise chart, and recommendations are 1st rate as well.Highly recommended."
5,Great Product!!,"I work on a tugboat were excersize equipment is limited so I am only able to workout using the basics, like pushups, pullups, etc. A guy on the boat had these and while I thought this was just another info-mercial gimmick i gave it a try. After the first time I used these, my whole arm,abs, and sides were sore, which told me these things really work a lot of muscles. After 2-weeks of using these i saw more results than doing the standard pushup. As soon as I got home I went out and bought me my own pair. I love these things. Highly Recommended."
5,Just as expected!,"My husband asked for this for Christmas, and he and my 10 year old are already using it. It is easy and works just as expected. Worth the price!"
5,Well Made,These are very well made. They rotate just as well as they did on day one. The included push up workout is actually pretty good.
3,"Good results, OK construction","Using this product is definitely better than pushups without it. I'm stronger after 3 months of using this product than I was before. However, the grips slide on the handles, and the handles move inside their housing. The grips are not as comfortable as I thought--I put hand towels over them and this solution works well enough. Bottom line--great workout, but construction could be better."
5,Feel the pressure on the upper back and chest,This is an awesome product. I highly recommend this one to anyone who is looking to get the upper body in shape. With a few variations you can get the biceps worked out too...The best part is this thing is light yet very strong..I have been doing pushups for years now and perfect pushup provided the right change..The first one I did got me hooked up..Great upper body builder....
5,Perfect,This machine provides the best results for the least amount of time[you do have to provide a ton of effort though] you could ask for.
1,I can do this..,"I can do this without the system, it's simple why don't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups..trust me it works, i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying ANYTHING."
2,"So-so product, beware of BodyRev","First of all, the product I received was used (scratched, and little dirt on the base). I sent them an email 3 days and still waiting for a reply.The product make pushups harder to do because you're elevating your upper body by several inch. Good for people who are trying to kick it up a notch but for a beginner trying to get back on shape, I think you are better off without."
2,good but overpriced,Why purchase this set when Jack Zatorski's Push Up Pro can be purchased for less than half the price? Although a little lighter it is the exact same technology - rotating rubber handles for optimal form and less wrist strain.
5,Different muscles,"I've been doing regular pushups all my adult life (I'm 61). This device takes a while to get used to, but it provides a much better workout than just getting down on the floor and pumping."
5,Just what it appears to be -- a great push-up enhancer,"The arm natureally wants to turn a quarter turn when extended. This device allows that when performing pushups. It seems to me to take some of the strain off the arm/elbow and allows it to move more natureally. They are very rugged, comfortable, and stable. Given how important pushups are, and the reasonable price, they are a must-have piece of home fitness equipment."
4,Good item - But you can get it much cheaper at Wal-Mart,Ok Everyone. This is a good product and I use it everyday. However (sorry amazon) Walmart is selling these for $19.95 in the store. So save yourself some money if you like.
5,Most Effective,Shipping is a little slow but the product is very effective. it takes less than 20 minutes to work out the upper body and you can see the results in week one. defintely an asset for someone who does not have time for gymn or need a quick strength training workout.
5,These are great!,"I will keep this review simple and to the point.. this product helps you achieve a full range of motion in your push-ups, hitting some muscles you normally don't with a regular one. It is also saves you from wrist pain!"
4,A better way to do push ups.,"These rotating hand holds make it much easier on your shoulders when doing push ups, but increase the intensity on the chest. This is the desired effect, working the chest harder while protecting the shoulders and elbows. They are also small enough to pack in a suitcase or stash in the car for working out while traveling."
4,Good Quality,"They were made of good quality, and work as described. Not too much else to say... shipping was very slow"
4,WORK FINE,WORK FINE. PUSH-UPS ARE VERY ISOLATED ACTIONS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC MUSCLE GROUPS. WITH THIS DEVICE U CAN ISOLATE THEM EVEN FURTHER.
2,a bit too tricky,"Well, it does what it claims to do-- changes alignment as you do pushups to avoid strain on your wrists. But it feels unstable (no turn resistance whatsoever), and isn't a significant enough improvement to warrant the high price. I've gone back to just using a folded-over towel under each hand."
4,Buy these from wal-mart,Wal-mart sells these for $20 every day. Why would amazon sell them for 40? So does Target for some reason.
2,Tried it but would rather do without it,I don't like push-ups but I do them anyway. I thought this product would make it a little easier to do push-ups but it got to be a little annoying how it would swivel around. I would rather do the push ups without this device!
3,works ok,"it works ok for what its suppose to do--helps take stress off joints and provides a lower measure to drop into the pushup. that said, dont expect to bulk up, even after doing a lot of these..."
1,Fake Perfect Pushup product - not original,"The ""used"" Perfect Pushup product I received was a fake and a bad copy of the original. It came in a branded box, but the devices themselves had no branding and didn't work well. I was able to compare them to my room mate's authentic model and they were clearly fakes that I received from a reseller on Amazon. Be very careful when you buy these. When they arrive, make sure they have the perfect pushup branding on the side just like in the picture."
2,good idea but many flaws,"I HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF PUSH-UPS FOR MANY YEARS AND CONSIDER MYSELF AN EXPERT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICE OF PUSH-UPS. THE IDEA OF THIS DEVICE IS INTERESTING BUT FLAWED IN SOME WAYS TO ME.THE FIRST THING IS THE LOOSE MOVEMENT OF THE DEVICE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR A NOVICE TO FEEL STABLE WHEN THEY FIRST GRASP THE CLAMPS, I ALSO IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THEY SAT TOO LOW ON THE FLOOR, THE BASE SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER SO THE PERSON CAN START COMFORTABLE OVER THE CLAMPS. ALSO MY HANDS ARE LARGE FROM DOING PUSH-UPS FOR MANY YEARS AND THESE HANDLES STILL TASKED MY ABILITY TO GRIP THE HANDLES.IF THE INVENTORS ADDED A LOCK ON THE SWIVEL OF THE CLAMPS I COULD GET MORE USE OUT OF DIFFERENT POSITIONS FOR MY PUSH-UPS.GOOD CONCEPT BUT NOT APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM STRENGTH YOU CAN GET OUT OF PUSH-UPS."
4,Great for less,I like my perfect push up by BodyRev. I have the basic set. I have had a sore shoulder/arm and bought these to improve my form. I also got the set for $19.84 at Walmart because they even beat Amazon!
1,Tore my rotator cuff.,I did exactly one push up and tore my rotator cuff and dislocated my shoulder. I had been doing regular push ups and workouts for months so I was not an out-of-shape novice. Stick to regular handles.
3,perfect push up,"If you do more than 100 push-ups a day, as I do, you will find this to be a beneficial aid. If not, forget it. Just use the floor."
5,Perfect Pushup is the Perfect Workout,"This is a very quality purchase for anyone that is looking to buff up in a few months time. I have been using the Perfect Pushup for the past 7 weeks, and can already see the differences and feel the changes. It takes about 20 minutes to do a full workout, and after the 19 day period of the workout, which is set up for you, you max out, and then set your workout for the next 3 weeks. I have not even been to the weight room at all, I use this with a combination of dumbbells, abdominal crunches/sit-ups and aerobics.Overall a great purchase..."
4,Good purchase,Received on time - works as described - not that difficult to use - would recommend to others that have the time to put into them.
4,Good.,"Yet another product for the fiance, and he likes them. These are very sturdy and do a great job of making your pushups better! I highly recommend them to someone who wants to improve their workout!"
5,Get to work!,"This product does just what it's manufacturer claims: it makes push ups more effective and less stressful for your arm joints. Very simple.The build quality is high. They were, and are, comfortable to use. And I had no trouble becoming accustomed to using them, even on the first try. My 10-year-old son had the same experience.Some reviewers have decried the workout booklet as being less than desireable. I would suggest ""Googling"" the term ""push ups"" and viewing the millions of sites that give tips on how to maximize this exercise. You'll pay the $40 for a well-built piece of exercise equipment. Do some research and devise your own workout routine for free.**Bottom line : I give a high ""BUY"" recommendation for the ""Perfect Push Up - Original"".**"
4,"Perfect Pushup is well, perfect","I like this product. I've used it quite a few times already and hope to use it regularly. I use it in a martial arts class also as part of our warmup. There are a lot of variations to the pushup and u can get a decent workout. It will work chest, arms, and shoulders. It's also great to take with u when travel. Light and portable. Overall a good investment. Thanks."
2,Good for the right people,"This product is great for the right people. It's construction quality is fairly good, and it works as advertised. Extra strong caution to anyone with any type of shoulder injury though. Using this product in the wide grip stance will eat your rotator cuff alive if there is any weakness at all. I used this product for about two months and noticed increased sensitivity in my shoulder as time went on. I now have difficulty lifting a gallon of milk into the fridge with my left arm because of the pain generated. I can't guarantee that the perfect pushup is responsible because my shoulder was never perfect, but it was the only excercise that I did recently where I felt any strain in my shoulder.So, if your shoulders are strong and you have no rotator cuff issues...it's fine. If you buy it, don't get to caught up in doing the ""wide grip"" position until you are certain that it isn't putting undue strain on you."
3,"Good product, but...","...I agree with other reviewers that the instructional DVD should be included and not a separate purchase. Having to pay an extra $14.95 for a short instructional video is, I think, a rip off. I love the product, but dislike being milked by the company that markets it."
3,"Good product, but lacks instructions!","I've always prefer doing workout without weights, and this does enhance and optimize your push up workouts. The rotating units provides more variety on form and less stress on the wrist. Unit is made mostly with plastic, but feels solid and durable.BUT, the lack of instructions on this item is VERY dissappointing. It comes with a foldout sheet consisting of some 6 basic forms. There is a DVD that you can purchase for $15 that supposively shows you different usages with the unit. That's nuts! How can a product be sold with its full instructions SOLD SEPERATELY! I do like the product very much, but this is the kind of scheme that as a consumer, find very distasteful and somewhat ripped off.Good product, but unfortunately, I can't support this company's policies. This will be the last product I will be purchasing from this company."
2,be careful--can mess up your shoulders,"I wanted something for high-rep upper body work, so I picked these up. They're perfectly fine for just doing some pushups, but if you get more intense and follow the advanced programs, they can really mess up your rotator cuffs if you have any weakness there (and most of us do). There are much safer exercises to get the same effects. So again, if you just want a good way to do some pushups without straining your arms and wrists, these things are fine. But don't go hardcore with them or you will regret it."
4,a challenging way for pushups,this product is great to get a different routine when doing pushups which makes it challenging compared to regular pushups. its a good quality product that lasts. you get results if you are consistent.
5,cute toy,there is nothing wrong with this toy that it should receive poor reviews. dont put toys in sterilizers - just wash in either a bleach mixture or hot soapy water regularly. my child loves his bendy bug!
3,Cute,"My sister in law gave me this toy for my son before he was born. When he was old enough to play with it, I put it in with his other toys and he didn't care for it. I'm not sure what the issue was, but a 6 month old can't really articulate their problems. I suppose it wasn't as easily rattle-y as his other toys, but who knows."
3,Okay Toy,"I work at daycare and we have this toy there. I'm not sure why the toy melted for one of the users but we sanitize all our toys in a ""sanitizer"" and the water gets well over 100 degrees and this toy didn't melt. I will say that I have had troubles with kids getting their fingers pinched or stuck inbetween the moveable parts."
1,Innappropriate,"Im not making a joke, I thought there was something weird about this toy, and when I saw it on the floor I knew. Its the exact shape of a certain part of the male anatomy. I think its inappropiate for a babys toy. Just my opinion."
1,Melted immediately,"This seems like it would have been a good toy, but I put it in my steam sterilizer prior to giving it to my baby and half the plastic melted. There's no warning against this on the packaging."
2,kind of a let down.,I bought this CD because it featured John Harrison I love his part of the cd but the rest was really boring. If you like John Harrison pick up his soundtrack from Day of The Dead 1985 really cool keyboard stuff!
2,AMATUREISH ATTEMPT AT SENSUALITY,"I decided to read this book due to a review I read by Catherine Bishop on the All About Romance Web-site. The story sounded intriguing and the review stated the sexuality was burning. The plot was unique in a ""cutesy"" sort of way and had wonderful possibilities, however I guess I've read too much Linda Howard, Stephanie Laurens, Nicole Jordan, and Dara Joy because the sensuality just left me flat. There's really only one consumate sex scene in this book and it lasts about a minute and a half. There is no romance to speak of at all and the idea of the heroine repeatedly placing sexual phone calls to the wrong number and not realizing she was talking to someone other than her boyfriend was difficult to buy into. I felt the whole tone of the book was adolescent in nature, if you want to read a really ""So Called Hot"" Contemporary Romance read Michelle Jerott's ABSOLUTE TROUBLE or ALL NIGHT LONG."
4,Whooo...keep some ice ready to cool down!,"Hot hot hot. No other word can describe this book so accurately. Thumbs up to Stephanie Bond! If you enjoy steamy books, then one has to be in your collection. The main characters, Georgia and Ken, light up the whole book...fire, to be more precise. This tale of mix-ups gone right will leave you begging for more. And if that's not all, the book's funny too!"
1,Nothing Here To Read,"I bought this book because Too Hot To Sleep was suppose to be funny. I stopped at page 100.No action after the dog was brought to ER. Everything kind of stalled. No other new things happen of interest. No development in the direction of the boyfriend, Rob. He is just out there someplace. This could have been very much alive with the three of them all mixed up together. The poor girl could have been mixed up so bad, that you would at least get a laugh, but Bond misses this many times.I work with men all day long. If any man acted like this cop at my shop, he would be thought of as a whimp, and picked on. No kidding, this guy acts like a girl.Men don't put up with women like this girl treated the cop either. I guess that's why it's fiction?Waste of money. Nothing here to read."
3,A nice Saturday afternoon read,"This was a nice book, sensual, sweet, and at times funny. I was really intrigued by the concept of the book. I would love to have read this as a full-length novel, where the author could have really expanded the story line and the sexual tone of the book."
5,just highlights,"while i am a fan of getting the entire Der Ring, because that is the only way to truly experience Wagner's stellar music, this is an excellent recording, especially of Dawn and Siegfried's Rhine Journey. for the Funeral March, i recommend the actual Der Ring with Solti conducting. that has more passion and takes its time for a stronger build up than Reiner does here. Still this is an excellent collection."
2,Can't figure it out,"After many of my friends would go on about how much fun they had playing cards, I couldn't wait to get my order in. And so cheap, almost too good to be true. Well I got my cards in and I have no idea what to do with them! There are a number of cards with various numbers and letters and strange symbols, but no instructions or anything of the sort was included in the (very small) box. After such high expectations, I fell a bit let down. Is it possible I was shipped a defective copy without an instruction booklet?"
2,Not as advertised,"I needed this item... RED Bicycle playing cards (as the vendor advertised)for a Graduate school project.However, the cards arrived with HALF of the decks being RED and HALF of the decks being BLUE. I couldn't use half of the decks I ordered and didn't have enough time with the slow-ish delivery to exchange the blue for red.If it was just advertised as red and blue bicycle cards, I would not have bought them.Overall, one of my least satisfying amazon purchases"
2,Good,yes it is good but not so good to becauze they are nice but after some usage they r not like they were before
3,Playing Cards,"Its playing cards that works. However, I have a red smudge on the back of 3 cards. Well that defeats the purpose of the cards now wouldn't that if Im going to use them for magic. Oh well, it was like 2 dollars."
3,Different from what's on the picture,"I had ordered them twice, and returned them twice because they are different from what the picture shows, they are standard pack you buy in walmart. It doesn't say Rider Back on them."
5,Wonderful,"I bought these a while back and they've lasted quite a long time. I use them mainly for personal magic, just practicing flourishes and whatnot, so I use them quite often. You can never go wrong with Bicycle cards, I highly recommend these cards!"
4,Not bad for the price I suppose.,"At first, these cards are great to use. They slide easily and have a nice feel. But, over time, they quickly start to wear out and become less and less usable. I've had these for about 3 days and they've already noticeably became harder to use. I would recommend this for people looking to use them a few hours a week/month, but not to people who practice flourishes and other tricks that bend them. After about 3-4 weeks, they will be unusable to people who perform card tricks due to their weariness."
3,"Pretty much the same as Steve Marriott and The All-Stars, exactly the same as the Archive Alive release from 1999","This is just a mid - 2000's Sanctuary records re-release of the 1999 Archive Alive release. No more no less on the track listing, sound, or liner notes.This release is also can be considered Steve Marriott and The All Star release. There was various label releases of Steve Marriott's All Stars which all contain tracks from these sessions.So while this is billed as a Humble Pie release, it truly doesn't have The Pie feel or groove to it. It's nore or less a Steve Marriott solo outing with friends. There is no focus or direction other than just jamming with band members and various other musicians circa 1974 / 1975. 20 tracks long, but nothing very memorable. Only for the absolute die-Hard Pie fans."
4,"Good pictures, but a little sparse","This is a decent buy. It helped me get an A- on my last test. The online thing is worthless. IT is just a copy of the book put online, without review or help, etc. I think that the pictures will be helpful to any medical student, but the text is rather sparse, and weird medical words and anatomical terms are used since this is a British book. They will call many things peculiar names, and also spell everything different. But still a decent buy."
4,Good,"Came on time, and was exactly what I was expecting. The package it came in was sturdy enough, I just wish the book was at least shrink-wrapped so that I would know it was new..."
5,Excllent book and excellent services Amazon.com,I have received the book. It is a mazing a good summary for the anatomyThank you amazon.com for the super class services. I have recived the book in such a short time.
3,"""Funky""","If you have the attire, these boots are cool! They are embossed and fit true to size. The pair I purchased were also ""funky"" , with regards to odor. They had a musty foot odor."
5,A MUST HAVE,"if you a true christian hip hop head, u must have this CD!!!!tight flow, lyrics, and Hot beats!!!!why u still doing here Gohead and Buy it!!!!"
5,"Easy assemble, quality product.","Only three bolts and came with hex wrench for one of the bolts. Word of caution, the table comes with a transport screw that locks the table in place so that you can't raise or lower the table until you change it for the smaller screw that comes with the table. I love the tilt table thought I have to scoot to the edge of my queen bed to use it. Love this table."
3,Works fine,"It's sturdy and wide range adjustments, needs go little lower for use in chair but clears my tall bed. Works well in tilt position to hold my kindle and I-pad. Thought the price reasonable for what I got."
4,Great Value,The table is sturdy and easy to assemble. I just wish the table top was a bit longer since I am using it on a full size bed. My bad for not thinking about the measurements when I ordered it.
1,Hospital overbed tray by Evacare,"Hospital overbed tray by Evacare Will not buy from them again. Hope I can find one that is easier to put together. Threw this one out. too late to return. Cound not get screws in even with a screw gun, directions unclear and too small to read. Made in China, some direction in ChineseVery disappoited"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Once I assembled this table, I was so excited to begin using it. I sat it in front of me while I was on the couch, and realized it was much too tall for me to use. I took off the wheels - while that is much better, it is still too tall. I do use it anyways, but would have preferred something a little shorter. Also, if you want to carry the thing upstairs, the stem that extends does not have a guard that you can lock so be careful when transporting around the house."
2,disappointed,On following the instructions it was NOT clear in which order to do what and I mistakenly turned the little screw which should be the LAST thing to do because it sprung the pole and since I didn't have the top screwed on it is now useless.
4,Just WHAT I EXDPECTED,"THIS IS A HOME VERSION OF THE TYPICAL HOSPITAL OVERBED TABLE. IT TURNEDE OUT TO BE OF A MUCH BETTER QUALITY THAN I EXPECTED, GIVEN THE LOW PRICE ASSEMBLED QUICKLY AND EASILY AND DOES THE JOB WELL FOR ME."
2,Bias overwhelms the useful information.,"This volume does have some virtues. It does contain useful information. It currently is in print, making it relatively inexpensive at under $25.00. It is also a nice looking book.The book's vices, however, far outweigh its virtues.Simply put, the book fails to be objective in its assessments of the Royal Navy and its ships. Instead, it reads like a volume published by a public relations firm paid by the Royal Navy. Brown simply ignores or glosses over the numerous flaws of Royal Navy ships of the period. Tony DeGiulian's superb review touches upon this to some extent, as does the discussion about his review.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive fan letter to the Royal Navy of the past, this might be your book. If you are looking for a book that objectively discusses the virtues and vices of Royal Navy designs in comparison to those of other navies, then I advise you to look elsewhere."
3,Too berry for me,"This is a nice Numi tea, but if you prefer more tea in a berry tea, this may not be for you. It is somewhat sour, and mostly red color. Try before you buy."
4,Great!,"I found this book to be insightful, helpful, and downright funny. Isaac does a wonderful job of integrating needful information on what is needed to succeed in graduate school from entrance until ending - and her advice works. In her book, Isaac mentions that sometimes you are not admitted the first time you apply, but tenacity pays off. I was not admitted to my first school where I was seeking a PhD, but was admitted a year and a half letter after following Isaac's advising of steps on how to making one's application more competetive.This book really encouraged me. It's an easy read, but worth every penny."
2,digital download,"The music is awesome as is all of Glsd's music, but I do not like the digital download at all. I do not like the pauses in the middle of the songs like I was listening to it on the internet. I wish I had purchased the CD instead."
2,A Very Politically Involved Mistress,"I was hoping for insight on more of the private life of Pompadour; instead, I got a very in-depth account of her political involvement. These were so detailed that at times, I tired of the seemingly endless political escapades Pompadour was a involved in. Sometimes, the book felt more like a biography 18th century French politics rather than the life of Pompadour. Her life was abrupt and her time as the romantic love of Louis XV's even shorter. After it was obvious that Louis XV no longer looked to her as a romantic partner, Pompadour positioned herself as a confidant, a friend, an advisor, among many other roles. This made her a very well-known woman in French royal society; some dubbed her as the Prime Minister of France, others called her the true Queen. While this book was well researched and well written, I still feel that it's a pity that this book focused more on her foray into politics rather than the overall doings of her private life."
4,Loved it!!!,Really enjoyed reading about this amazing woman. I think the French monarchy was amazing in their choice of mistresses -- I would have hated being a wife!
3,Bookshelf filler,"Sorry to the author - I feel bad writing bad reviews about well intentioned books, but there has to be *some* way of separating the wheat from the chaff.It's actually not bad, it's just mediocre, yet-another-wicca-101, but aimed at the college crowd this time.Or, less of a Wicca 101, more focused on just being a 'Wiccan at College', by someone not that experienced, interviewing the equally inexperienced (not being ageist here, I would have thought the same at 18 - actually, I'd have been a little more disparaging. Ooops), and really, there's not that much involved in 'being a wiccan at college' or enough insight in the concept for the size of the book.I'd recommend 21st Century Wicca instead, it has a chapter or so on practising in college situations etc which seems a better substitute."
2,Misses the Mark,"I acquired this CD in hopes of hearing a great selection of Gershwin songs performed by some of the greatest performers to have graced a listener's ear.Unfortunately, the recording quality on the CD is definitely sub-standard. It's almost torturous to listen to the CD, knowing what it should sound like. I found myself driving along saying, ""Gee, this song would have been terrific, if only the recording were better"", or, ""Had only they remastered some of these recordings!""Alas! I should have passed."
2,Boring!,"Bach's Art of Fugue is one of my favorite pieces, but I'm not fond of this particular performance of it. Each player seems to be trying to play a solo above the others rather than function as an ensemble, obscuring the counterpoint. There's nothing technically wrong with the performance, but there are far more interesting interpretations of the music on period instruments."
5,THE SOUND OF ETERNITY,"J. S Bach: Die Kunst Der Fuge (The Art Of The Fugue)is an absolute stunning masterpiece. Beginning to end. This 2cd album has the perfect ensemble performing the music: the Julliard String Quartet (Robert Mann, Violin; Joel Smirnoff, Violin; Samuel Rhodes, Viola; and Joel Krosnick, Cello). The music is performed as though performed in a monastery. It is intimate, tempos are easy & relaxed. There is a grace emitted throughout that is palpable. This music is essentially mystical. In my opinion, this is the music of ETERNITY. Bach was a connsumate musical genius. This music and the performance of it is and will be a gift forever to the world. I sampled and then purchased this album coutesy of Amazon. I can't too highly recommend this album."
2,Disappointing,We were very excited to buy this after seeing the intro for this DVD. My two year old son absolutely loves trucks and we watched the preview on Youtube and sang the intro song over and over. It turns out that the intro was the best part because we were all bored by the rest. Now he refuses to watch even the intro. Hopefully if they make another they'll make the story move a little faster.
3,Shipment to costly.,The glove are great and very durable but i paid more for shipment the the cost of the glove. Shop around.
4,Works well for most things,"I purchased this microwave about a year ago and have been pleased with it for the most part. It has consistent heating over the whole food and is quite powerful for the price. The size is also a welcome feature, in that my previous microwave was about 0.7 cubic feet. The stainless steel is easy to clean and adds a contemporary look to the kitchen. My favorite feature is probably the popcorn button which quite literally pops exactly the number of kernels in the bag without burning the popcorn. It is not a feature-filled microwave, but has warm, soften, reheat and defrost options. I only use the defrost beside the cook because I never took the time to determine how they work. Unfortunately the defrost is the only major flaw I can find with the microwave. It is not terribly difficult to use, but as far as I can tell you are unable to ""tell"" the microwave that you want to cook anything over 2 lbs. Aside from that it is a solid built, good powered, cheap and easy to use."
1,Do not buy Sharp Carousel Microwave!,"The reason you see everything from 5 star to 1 star reviews for this microwave is that it all depends if the product is working or not. If this microwave works it is functional and relatively easy to use, but if it konks out -- you have a useless appliance. Sharp knows it is not worth repairing and in all likelihood another microwave will be purchased. Not even 9 months after buying this microwave it made a loud sound and no longer would heat. Personally I want something reliable and am tossing this microwave and moving onto another brand. I am having surgery in a month and will need a microwave and am at least thankful it did not stop functioning just after my surgery. But in all honesty it is not worth playing Russian roulette when you have other microwaves to choose from. Reliability is important to me. There are too many of these types of complaints about this Sharp microwave on Amazon. Why take a chance? Stay away from Sharp microwaves."
1,MY THIRD SHARP MICROWAVE,"This is the third Sharp microwaveSharp R-305KS 1-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave Oven, StainlessI have owned. The other two lasted about ten years each. That should speak for itself. However it does not. After ten months of use the oven just stopped working. By that I mean STOPPED period. I called Sharp and they were totally not interested in helping me. They did refer me to a service center for repair but as I am a senior citizen and unable to drive and unable to lift the unit and carry it on a bus;there was nothing I could do. So if anyone wants a 45 pound pile of junk and can make their way to Houston it is yours."
2,very disappointed,"We bought this microwave based on having had good luck with Sharp products and its appearance and its price. The microwave was a disappointment from the start. The motor sounds like it's about to die. We are unable to get microwave popcorn popped with any accuracy. It is either burnt or there are dozens of unpopped colonels in the bag. I should have returned it right away, and I don't know why I didn't, but it's too late now. It is inconsistent in its heating of other food as well. No problems with Sharp before, so maybe just a lemon."
1,Two Returns -- Poor Quality Control,The first one I ordered had a dented top. Returned to Amazon with no problem and another one ordered. Second one had a scratch on front panel. This too was returned to Amazon with no problem. I gave up on the Sharp and purchased a GE.
1,sharp R 305ks microwave,"I have always bought sharp microwaves which have been reliable.This one is not. After 4 months of use, it stops working. It doesn't shut off the power strip. It just stops after less than a minute of being on. It started gradually and now is consistent.In addition, it sounds tinny when I close the door.Very bad.z"
2,price,I found better priced microwave in other stores after I bought this one.The motor of the microwave is very noisy. I am not happy with this purchase at all.Thanks
3,Digital read out already degrading,"I purchased this product 6 weeks ago, and the digital read out is already degrading, so forget telling time, reading instructions or using the digital read out for any purpose. It still heats up food, but is a far cry from the durability of GE microwaves I have owned in the past."
1,garbage,i bought this microwave while i was deployed and it sat in its box until i came home a couple of months later then i come home only to have this microwave work for aproximately 1 mont and now it doesn't work at all...... definitely not worth the money.....
2,"Ok for awhile, but . . .","I bought this Sharp because it was available to replace its burnt-out predecessor from Bed & Bath immediately, and it had to 1) fit into my custom-kitchen space, and 2) match my stainless and black appliances. It does both, but unfortunately, after 3 weeks of operation (and not happy with its clumsy features) the window and LED display began clouding up. I am now bringing it back and getting a Panasonic Genius NN-H765BF, which is a bit larger and has more features."
1,NOTE THIS MICROWAVE IS 23 1/8 INCHES WIDE,"Sounds like a good microwave based on Amazon reviews, but beware the manufactures website lists the width as 23 1/8 not the 20.5 listed on Amazon, so it wouldn't have fit in cabinet space."
1,So it looks good...big deal,I was looking for something a bit more powerful then the micro I had and this thing seemed to fit the bill from the specs but....I found the food doesn't heat up all that much differently then the one I have that's over ten years old not to mention it leaves a lot of cold spots in the food. Heats up pretty unevenly IMO.The keypad on the front developed a tiny blister on the power/on button cover and now it's become a rip...grrrrrrr.I'm really unsatisfied with this thing and don't recommend it at all.It looks nice though....but so does a tree.. I should have spent the money planting one..it would have served me better.
4,Just what I wanted,I bought this for my bedroom. It is half the size of the one I have out in the kitchen for the rest of the house to use which is all so a SHARP I have no complaints.
1,The microwave which would not open,"I did a lot of research on this product and that is why I was twice as angry when I couldn't even open the door on this product. It was a Mother's day gift and I presented it to my mother. ""Well, see what the manual says about this,"" says my mother. Sure, Mom, once I can get the door open, I can then get the manual, and then, I'll read the manual as to how to get the door open. Amazon was good about refunding my purchase price plus the shipping(back). I will do more research and find another microwave."
3,Catastrophic Smokey Failure,This product was given to us as a gift about one year and three weeks ago. I'd rate it adequate. Its flexibility contributes to its complexity. It's probably got more features than we need.This evening we were heating a dinner dish and in a matter of moments the kitchen and house filled with a burning plastic smell and extremely noxious smoke. It was the microwave; not the food. The smoke was thick and it was difficult to breath. It's 14 degrees Fahrenheit outside and we've got the doors and windows open trying to air out the house. I'll press to test the Sharp limited warranty process but I'll also notify the government product safety folks. Our experience tonight seems similar to the review preceding mine. If we've got an unsafe trend beginning with this product the right folks need to know. Thirty minutes after we shut it down I had to use an oven mitt to carry it out to the garage because the bottom right side was still too hot to touch.
4,Good oven,"I like the oven, except that there is no light on the touchpad and it is difficult to see to program. Other than that, it works great."
3,Sharp R - 305KS 1100W Microwave,"It does all you would want a micro-wave to do! Wish the height inside, (about 8"") were a little higher, that's my biggest regret. Overall I'm happy with it's performance."
2,Didn't last very long,I bought one of these a year ago and and it died last night.Not too happy about that.I have mobilty issues and will have to dispose of this thing somehow.Also just buying a replacement puts a huge strain on my budget.Wont buy another Sharp oven.
3,"Open, Sesame!","Alas, the door would not open for love or money. Imagine the frustration. Whether it jammed at the factory (my guess) or during shipment, it had to go back to Amazon. Still, I give the experience Three Stars. Sharp is a respected brand, it was indeed a very handsome appliance offered at a fair price, and Amazon was probably blameless."
2,Was great while it worked,"Just wanted to add my experience in with the others who had issues with this microwave. We actually had ours for several years and it worked very well, but the other day, we were using it regularly when it popped and burned as others have described. The door on ours actually had a melted and burned spot on it! Obviously, we are out of our warranty period, but I've had microwaves in the past last MUCH longer than this one! I will be buying a different brand to replace it for sure!"
3,Worked great for 2 years,"This microwave seemed to be a great buy 2 years ago. Performed adequately at a good price. Almost 2 years later, it just stopped heating one day!"
1,Made it just past the warranty!,"I bought one of these for a relative-fit/function/operation seemed fine 'til just after the warranty expired, when most of the buttons would not operate. Since it was out of warranty, she plugged along since the one-touch button operations were 'bout the only thing she used. After a couple more months, the last few remaining buttons that did work gave it up. She has a display, but none of the control buttons work.I've had a couple of Sharps over the years, and they seemed to be quality units.I guess Sharp has now joined the ranks of those in a race to the bottom?"
1,Unreliable,"After only a few months casual use, the buttons failed to operate. I was never able to set the time or timer. One of the worst pieces of electronic equipment I have ever purchased. Less than a year later it went in the trash."
1,I got a lemon,"It looked great and worked great at first, but within a month it started making a horrible sound, as if something broken was rotating inside. It was intermittent at first but then became more regular. We're ditching it."
1,Warranty Service Difficult To Obtain,"I purchased a Sharp R-420LW in December, 2008 from hhgregg. In June, 2009 the sensor feature failed causing sparks and loud grinding noises to emanate from the oven. I located Sharp repair services on the internet and called the listed number to obtain service. Unfortunately, I did not ask if the location listed on Sharp's website was accurate. I took the oven to the listed location only to find a vacant residential house. I then went to hhgregg where the original purchase was made and after a lengthy wait an hhgregg ""manager"" begrudgingly provided me with a 800 number that led to a repair service in a city some 240 miles from my location. I heartily caution anyone interested in a Sharp product to first check out warranty service availability.Sharp R-305KS 1-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave Oven, StainlessSharp R-230KK 800-Watt 4/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Microwave, BlackSharp R-520LW Full Size Countertop MicroSharp R-520LKT Full Size Countertop Micro"
1,Junk me two times...,"The first one from amazon, the door would not open. The internal opening mechenisim was broken. Sent it back to amazon, what a pain. Got a new one. It worked for a week, but not well. Weak power, strange noises.Then just stopped working. Too late to return to amazon. Must find a repair place, none very local. Don't buy things like this from amazon, buy from a local dept. store with a good return policy. Also, stay away from sharp. the old ones were great, new stuff is not..."
3,Not as good a quality as expected,"This Sharp microwave was less than I expected. It replaced a Panasonic and the build quality is definitely inferior. Opening and closing the door, one gets the feeling that they are breaking it. It is also very loud.However, it does seem to cook fairly evenly."
1,Lasted 2 months,Good size microwave. Used very little but only lasted 2 months.Will try to deliver to a Sharp service center and will report back.Not so easy to figure out the controls. After 2 months it makes a noise and does not heat up the food.Sharp repair center fixed it for free. Only had to wait two weeks for the repair. Worked for another 3 months. Today I am bringing it back to the repair center again. This could be the last Sharp product I ever buy.
1,broke after 14 months....,"Wow, I've had an old sharp microwave made before I was born that lasted 18+ years and this thing only lasted about a lil over a year (14 months). It looks to be good quality but it isn't. It just randomly died. I would highly not recommend this microwave to anyone and Sharp has lost my business with them. Looks great but will not last long and that is why it's priced cheaply in most places. I think I'm gonna go buy an Amana brand microwave. Damn you Sharp!"
4,good Microwave,it looks and operate great.. but it broke down after almost a year. thanks God the warranty was in effect still.. they fixed it for free and had a great customer service.thanks
4,Great Microwave,Great Microwave!PROS:Quick and AccurateSettingsEasy to read and understand functionsWell BuiltLooks GreatEasy Set-upCONS:Slightly expensive for the size/wattage
2,"ok, but there are better options","Every time I close the door of my microwave and it makes a loud ping noise, I wish I hadn't bought it. Different cooking options are not intuitive, so months later I am still pulling out the instruction book. It was one of the cheapest options for this size and power in stainless. It works OK."
1,Not made to last,"My previous Panasonic MW lasted 20 years, and while I realize that almost all products produced nowadays aren't made to last, the Sharp MW didn't even last one year. The confusing keypad and shortcuts required referring to the manual ALL the time. It makes a pretty loud hum when it is running -- but you'll only have to put up with that for 6-8 months before the cheap piece of junk dies. I truly believe that it is just really hit-or-miss with Sharp products, and no way no how am I going to take that chance again."
1,Carousel stopped working,"I've had the microwave for a couple of years but have lived with a malfunctioning carousel for about 6 months, planning to replace it. This is in a vacation home so isn't even used very often. And I don't use a microwave for much more than reheating food very occasionally. Other issue that I don't like is ease of use - not intuitive at all!! I was surprised to see this model so highly rated."
4,pleased,Received in a short time. Like the style and so far has worked as stated. Easy to use and just the right size. Is more powerful than my older panasonic of 12 yrs. So far happy with it.
1,Disposable microwave,"I guess for $100 plus I've got a disposable unit - it died in 14 months.Midlife wasn't pretty either - a rotating glass dish cracked in the process of heating a small frozen dinner pack.Also: noisy when working; very loud door locking mechanism sounding like somebody hit a large empty steel barrel with a hammer; whatever you put in center of the rotating dish will be off to the inner walls by the end of the process (it stands on the perfectly horizontal brand new granite countertop).My old Panasonic had one problem in 15 years - a burned out light bulb inside.Of course, quality is going south in general, but 14 months life? It looks like all mw owens regardless of the brand made on the same plant in China, so I'll have to use my gas range more."
2,Sharp is not what it used to be!,"Instead of describing the product as having a ""stainless steel"" look, a more accurate description would read ""aluminium foil"" used to achieve a ""stainless steel"" look. The quality of this product is minimal re materials and workmanship."
5,Pleased with Sharp Microwave Oven,My Sharp Microwave Oven R-305KS is the best microwave oven I've ever owned. It's a good buy.
1,sharp microwave,microwave arrived damaged and inoperable. Upon inspection the product and packaging appeared to be of poor quality. I returned for a refund.
3,Don't pay more,"Um, one of the top national electronics retailers has this for 15 dollars less! I won't say which one but it's Careless Checking on those prices by Amazon."
2,Lasted 6 months!,"This Sharp microwave was very powerful and cooked/heated foods quickly and evenly... for about 4 months. After that, the food started cooking unevenly, even if the item was placed in the middle of the rotating plate.After 6 months, I tried to heat up my stringbeans and it started a mini fire in the microwave! Thinking it was my plate, I switched plates and tried again. 2 seconds into the warming, a mini fire errupted again, but this time followed by a loud ZAPping sound. I am scared to even try again, so here I am, shopping for a new one on Amazon.I would not recommend purchasing this, and if you do, would recommend you stay close to it so that a fire does not start up! It was pretty scary!And lastly, the footprint of this microwave is HUGE and takes up a lot of space... so unless you are constantly heating foods for a huge family, I would recommend getting something smaller!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I purchased this microwave as I needed a larger more powerful model. My previous Sharp was still operating after 15 years. This one lasted only six months. I am told it needs a new magnatron which seems to be a common complaint. Seems like this product should be recalled and Sharp should up their quality control. No more Sharp for me!
2,disappointed with the quality,"6 weeks after buying this, 2 of the quick buttons (""melt, soften"") stopped working, so we lived with it like that until after 2 1/2 years 75% of the number pad stopped functioning. The minute plus button and the 1,2,3,5,8, and 0 buttons quit as well. We still had our 15+yr old Sharp microwave in the basement so we went back to using it. The newer microwave definitely had a lower quality feel about it in general."
2,"Sharp once better quality, no longer; 14 months then dead","Had very similar Sharp model in bisque that was solidly made and performed well for years and years, used daily. When it needed replacing, was delighted to find it in stainless since bisque impossible to get. However, was rather suspicious of the model when I found it displayed in a local store -- it seemed more flimsy than my old Sharp. When purchased, deliberately did not buy extended warranty, since I knew I'd switch brands if this one proved lousy.For 14 months it worked fine and controls similar to previous model; however, was noisier and tin-like (not really the robust feel of stainless, just the appearance). It stopped heating and I kicked it to the curb (actually, taken in for recycling). Now trying out GE with extended warranty. My guess is that manufacturers are putting better quality into models with convection and/or range-hood installation (higher priced more profitable)."
1,As Sharp as a headache...,"This microwave was great...for the 4 years that it worked, and that is just a household with just 2 people and less than average use. The Sharp customer service rep I talked to today said it's typical for this model to stop heating in that amount of time. The part could still be under warrantee but all service centers are over an hour away...and I don't live in a rural area. Do NOT buy this microwave unless you like the idea of throwing it in a landfill in 3-4 years and buying another one."
2,Planned obsolescence,"This is the second Sharp microwave my wife and I have owned. Both worked fine through the warranty period then lost functions. In the case of the first - the clock/timer/display no longer lit making it difficult to set up anything more complex than reheating. The second developed a problem with the door latch this morning. Sharp has built in a safety feature that won't allow the oven to work when the door isn't securely closed. I suspect they are complying with a federal regulation. Fortunately, if I really slam the door, it will work, however, I'm sure it will crap out at the least convenient moment. No more Sharp nukes for us."
1,It was nice while it lasted!,"The Sharp replaced the horrible Kenmore which replaced the wonderful Panasonic, which replaced something else, but now we're going back over 10 years. This one lasted a year and a half before starting to spark and smoke. Bye-bye...."
2,"Works for a while, but...","We purchased this little Sharp microwave a couple of years ago. It worked fine up until the last six months or so. The touchpad buttons have been going dead, one by one. We are left with the ""minute plus"" button and a few remaining number buttons to do most of our cooking at the moment."
2,Dull,"Back in the 70's a film called ""Short Eyes"" was released. It had the same type of plot, and I found that movie to be more convincing than this one. The actors were drab, the cutaway scenes of them telling their stories of what happened was a bore. They sure don't make prison movies like they used to. Short Eyes was much much better."
3,Stokowski conducts Mahler Symphony # 2,"This performance of the Mahler Symphony # 2 is for those who like their music fast-faster-faster yet. It relates to the style of Klemperer, who conducted it as though there was a fire on the podium. For those who heard Leonard Bernstein conduct this work in the later 1980's, the contrast could not be greater: Bernstein's pacing allows the music the time it needs to ""breathe"" and affords the listener an opportunity to observe what the Biblical Psalmists noted as ""selah"" -- ""Pause, and calmly think of that!"". The musicians acquit themselves well, though there are times of seemingly perfunctory playing."
1,it is thinner than the original,It fit the cover but it is thinner than the original so it is not doing the job the vapor still leak
2,Leaky Gasket,Worked under 10 lbs pressure and leaked somewhat and when used under 15 lbs pressure - pressure caused liquid to leak out under rim with explosive force!
4,Pressure cooker seal works just fine,"After receiving the new seal, I thought it was the wrong one. But with a little work, I was able to work it into the lid rim.Keep the seal in the rim after each cleaning, It seems to grow longer after each use."
4,Famous four tackle Brahms,"These three pieces are some of the greatest in the literature, and for the most part this is a good recording. Unlike many chamber music collaborations between soloists, these four don't let the music disintegrate into a shouting match or an ego contest (thank goodness). However, as usual, Stern's sound is rather thin and doesn't quite hold up to the power and depth that Brahms demands; I would also prefer a ""real"" violist rather than a ""switch-hitter"", but Laredo is mostly admirable and perhaps he simply adjusted to better balance Stern's more slender tone. And nothing beats the slow movement of the c minor quartet - this and the third movement of Beethoven Op. 132 would be my choices for that old ""If you could only take ____ to a desert island..."" question. Overall a commendable collection; the good parts far outweigh the weak."
5,Very Good!,"These piano quartets by Brahms are very enjoyable, as is normal for chamber works by Brahms. The sound quality (recorded 1989 and 1986*) is good. I think the performers did a good job on these quartets. The pieces are played with a good deal of energy, especially the G Minor and C Minor. I would recommend these CDs too anyone wanting the Brahms piano quartets.Piano Quartet in G Minor1st Mov. - 13:382nd Mov. - 8:053rd Mov. - 10:134th Mov. - 8:05Piano Quartet in A Major1st Mov. - 16:462nd Mov. - 12:513rd Mov. - 11:404th Mov. - 10:55Piano Quartet in C Minor*1st Mov. - 10:552nd Mov. - 4:123rd Mov. - 9:094th Mov. - 10:57"
4,Tamara,"Took Forever to receive product, extremely nice price, great product, just try to order a month ahead of need."
4,"Fit well, hate plastic...","The bra fit well on the car. I hate that everyone uses plastic anymore. The tie-down/retaining clips should be metal. They work ok, but don't over tighten! Shipping was fast as usual!"
3,Not bad if you like these kinds of affirmations,"I found the book Affirmations, A Pathway To Transformation an ok book. If you like affirmations written like this then it's ok I guess.But I think my own affirmations work best for me."
5,TurboTax,"This is great software. I am a computer & finance specialist, and have been using TurboTax to do my taxes for the past several years. With this software, I can easily do the taxes for family and friends. Don't bother paying more for the Deluxe version if you don't need to, this is enough. Great product, I will buy it every year."
1,unable to download,if i could download the program i could review it but all i get is illegal operation and can not get any help
2,Good product but don't buy for pre-2000 Quicken,I wanted to transfer info from Quicken 98 to this program but it only accepts transfers from Quicken 2001. Thanks alot!
1,Where is the rebate?,Amazon.com lists a $5.00 rebate and provides a link. When the link is clicked no rebate coupon appears. I've emailed amazon.com and requested that the link be fixed. I will post any updates here.
4,Easy taxes,"This is a very nice piece of software. It guides through the entire process and even has diagrams of the forms so you know exactly which number to record from which box. The help section offers assistance on procedures you may not be familiar with. My favorite part is that if you use TurboTax year after year it will look at your old returns and see if your information is within reason as well as gathering name and address so you don't have to enter it again. My only problem is with investment income. The software does still require some knowledge on your end of different methods of reporting investment income, such as FIFO or average. But, all in all, a nice program that simplifies that task we all dread."
1,software is not ready for prime-time,"When one starts the software, it immediately instructs one to update it through the Internet. However, the software crashed repeatedly when it was about to install the updates. Furthermore, if your legal residence is in one of the US territories (i.e.: Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Mariana Islands, etc.) this software is absolutely useless. I decided to buy the software after I ran into serious difficulties using the online version, thinking that the CD version would have less glitches. Well, it appears that both suffer from the same problems."
5,Great product!,I've used turbo tax for the last two years to prepare my taxes and find it to be very user friendly. The software walks you through step by step and provides prompts to enter information when needed. I plan to use Turbo Tax to prepare my 2000 taxes.
5,Excellent as to story and pictures both,"A very well written book that explains who these people were, and are. Along with very nice pictures of some of their work."
3,Pretty good dictionary,This is a pretty good dictionary. There was some problems with it though. It didn't have a lot of words in it that you would need if you are in a writing class. I would say if that doesn't bug you this is a great buy. If it does find a better dictionary.
4,5star seller,I purchased this dictonary for my daughter and its great for school student! She loves it.
1,Not Accepted,"After ordering the ""Webster Dictionary"" and paid in full the book was rejected by the St. Louis Correctional Facility, it is now sitting in the ""rejection Cabinet"" at the facility.I do not know how to solve this problem. I am at a loss of $19.95. Any suggestions?"
1,uhm..,"Actually, the dictionary was nothing like the one in the picture. It is an old dictionary and it has missing pages. Also it took time to come."
3,Avoid this if you're looking for definitions,"I bought this as a handy way to look up words I was unfamiliar with (BA English Lit) as I read. As I read a popular newsmagazine, a popular British murder mystery and watched a popular TV comedy, I looked up about a dozen words. Only about a third were listed, and a few of those had incomplete or erroneous definitions. VERY disappointing.I guess this could help you spell."
4,Handy Dictionary,I sent this as a gift to my boy who is incarcerated. He uses it frequently and its size and binding was acceptable to the institution.
3,Concise And Affordable,"This isn't the best dictionary you can have. I've found a number of words already, in my short time of owning it, that are notably missing. However, for the price, it's pretty good."
3,Chalk is great picture is deceiving.,"I specifically wanted a factory box of chalk like is pictured with the Master box. Apparently that box holds significantly more than 12 pieces of chalk. I received a small white box with a plastic baggy with 12 pieces of chalk inside.The chalk works fine and it is the legendary master brand. I just wish there was an option to buy exactly what is pictured, even if it means buying a larger quantity.Shipping was fast and the packaging was secure and prevnted any damage. Also important when buying pool chalk it is apparently stored properly in a low humidity area as there was no moisture damage signs.I would buy again, would have rated 5 stars if I had received the red and white box. I know that seems trivial but its what I wanted."
5,Classic blue chalk,"This is the classic blue chalk from Master. It arrived quickly, and in the red and white box as pictured."
5,Blue Chaulk,"Great product for the price. I just wish they would of had a better box. I don't use 12 pieces of chaulk at a time on my home table. So it would be nice if it came in like a plastic box, or even a slide out box versus, just a bottom and lid. When you pick it up by the lid, it is easy to dump them out. Not a big deal."
5,No better way to teach your little Buckeye life long values!,"My 2 year old already loves Brutus Buckeye so I got this book for her. And she loves it! I have read it to her at least a dozen times since I received it 2 days ago. The book teaches the foundation skills that everyone should follow: help others, set goals, etc. The book is very basic and perfect for your child, with some great pictures of Brutus which my daughter enjoys the best! A must have for all Buckeye fans!"
1,Dumb book,"I ordered this book for my daughter bc we are huge OSU fans. Each page has one word on it, and it really doesn't make sense. I was very disappointed. We returned it~!"
1,I love you Brutus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Brutus. I feed off the spirits of buckeyes, so when i saw the title of this book, i immediatley got excited. But it turns out that this is a childrens book. O well. I am off to harvest some more souls now."
2,Romance it's not...,"I'm a huge romance novel fan, so this book seriously disturbed me. Obviously the editors at Amazon miscategorized this one. Romance is about love and an emotional bond between two people, not love toys and emotionless bondage scenes. And what was up with that threesome romp?! If you've ever listened to a call-in-your-relationship-problems talk radio show, you'll know that bringing a third person into the marital bed is always a bad idea. I felt like I needed to bathe after reading this book. If you're a closet porn fan who's too embarassed to buy reading material from a seedy adult store, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a sensitive, emotional rendering of love (and yes, love scenes), pick up anything by Maggie Shayne, Dara Joy, or Johanna Lindsey."
1,"So I know NOT to trust Amazon's ""Romance Expert""",This book was even trashier than every other Small work I've gotten my hands on
2,Most risque book I have read in a long while.,"I wish that I had read the other reviews before reading this book. It had a boring start and then all of a sudden went into bondage. It was hot, not too descriptive, but the threesome was too much.This is the first book by this author I have read. I do not think I will read anymore seeing the tone set in this one."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you need a book to put you to sleep at night this is the one! Even the sex scenes has me on the brink of sleep...The storyline is more than bad, I thought it was rediculous. Read the other reviews and am still trying to figure out where the good parts to this book are? I am sticking to Lori Foster and Linda Howard!!"
2,Prepare to feel smutty,"What happened to Bertrice Small? Normally her books are a whirlwind of history, adventure and sensuality. She is usually one of my favorite authors. Her books have always been hot, but this is ridiculous! The first half of this book was classic Small. The rest of it read like a bad porno flick. There's sensual, sexy and sizzling and then there is this crock. I felt sleazy just reading it and didn't even bother to finish it through. I just skipped to the end to read the requisite Happily Ever After ending and sighed with relief that this didn't come out in hardcover. Please, Ms. Small, go back to writing what your readers want and don't jump on the ""more sex than story"" bandwagon!"
5,NOT FOR THE FAINT,"HELLION is sexually explicit, exotic, emotional and adventurous. It's the story of Isabelle (Belle), a strong-willed and hot-tempered lass in Olde England. The book is rare in that it's situations and responses are unpredictable. Belle, the heroine goes into a forced marriage, deals with the amorous advances of the King, and has a run through withcraft and sorcery. Through it all, she maintains her wits, her determination and her dedication to her family and her lands. Hellion is longer than most romantic novels, but its length allows the author freehand at creating passionate encounters and unexpectd adventures. The fiction in the book is well-woven into the real history of the times. If you're looking for something erotic and very different, this is the book for you."
1,Are you kidding?,"I read all those great reviews, but when I actually read the book, I was sorely dasappointed. The plot is weak, as I find that the chracters fall in and out of love too unnaturally, the humour is even weaker as the ""Belle from Hell"" is simply childish, and the ""hot"" sex scenes were anything but! it reads ore like an instruction manual: ""this is *whatever herb/paste*, apply to *whatever body part* or insert into orifice, then *this* is supposed to happen, this is what you feel, etc."" basically, really unrealistic and static. not worth even the effort to borriw and read."
4,"Another ""dislike grows to love"" story!","Many of Mrs. Small's books feature a heroine who is strongwilled, unconventional and refuses to be dominated. In Hellion, Belle is no exception. Forced by the king to marry Hugh Falconier, she at first resists her growing passion for him. As he learns to respect her and her fine mind, she grows to love him, even as he loves her. Naturally, something must part these lovers (this is a Small book, after all!) and in this case it is caused by Belle's wicked half brother. Of course there is a happy ending, but first the lovers must be separated and put through all sorts of sexual escapades, exactly as one would expect from Mrs. Small's writing. Not for the faint of heart, there is sexually explicit material in her; once again, after all, it is by Bertrice Small!!! Give it a read!!"
3,Typical Betrice Small,"This is my 3rd Bertrice Small book and probably the last. They are all the same. Herione (usually under 16) is ordered by the King du jour to marry one of his favored knights/lords. As soon as she falls in love with him and bears him a child-he is called away, she goes after him, they both commit adultery (repeatedly), heroine is then kept from her husband and child for a year or more. Hero has hard time getting over wife's adultery, which she commits to save his life. And the heroine seems to always have better sex with her lovers than her husband. Now I love my husband (a career military man) but I can't imagine abandoning my child to follow him to war for years or months at a time. Granted, times were different back then but still I would choose my infant child over my husband."
4,Reading Early American Handwriting,This is a very necessary book for any genealogist working with the 18th century and early 19th century records in the United States. I am a DAR genealogist and it has helped me immensely.
4,reading early american handwriting,"Good reference, well documented. Provides extensive examples to acquaint the reader with styles and types of handwriting which may be observed in early courthouse, church, and other works."
5,Fun Reading,"I read constantly and have dozens and dozens of books waiting for me to read-but when this one arrived I read it right away. I had to know all about beards. I LOVE facial hair on men though I don't particularly like beards. Make sense??? What I'm saying is that I like sideburns, goatees, soul patches, goatees without moustache, etc. Just seeing a man with a heavy shadow and the proverbial 5 o'clock shadow. ALL very sexy!! I would have liked more present day photos, but I liked it all. I wish someone would write a book about men's hairy legs. One thousand sets of hairy legs. Then I would really go crazy!!"
1,Beard? Weird!,"I, for one, find body hair of any description totally abhorrent, so I found this book one of the most difficult and challenging reads of my life. Peterkin's description of hair follicles, for example, borders, at times, on the pornographic.I had to skip the chapter where he waxes lyrical about the curl-to-density ratio of pubic hair because I became too nauseous to carry on reading."
1,Poor Quality,"I received my kit yesterday and tried to test it last night. I have found several problems with it already. I found that it is just a fraction too large to fit the Bosch RA1100 adapter I use with my routers. (The RA1100 allows Bosch routers to use standard Porter-Cable style bushings, which it otherwise does well, so it should fit.) I also found that the alignment pin is useless as it does not fit into the bushing. Again, it's just a hair too large. I also noticed that the rubber O-ring that retains the removable bushing gets pinched and tears a little bit each time it is removed and replaced. So it is beginning to self destruct already. Considering that this is an accessory designed to do a precise operation, the quality is quite poor. (Note: it's made in China.) In my opinion, this is not a good quality tool. My recommendation is to find a more accurately made set. It'll save you a lot of headaches."
2,Alignment pin not correct size,"The alignment pin that came with the kit is too small to fit a 1/4 inch collet, and too big on the other end to fit into the bushing hole! So I have to do the alignment by eye. The inlays come out close, but they're not dead on. I need to do more sanding than I'd expect, which usually leads to poor fitting inlays."
5,Thank you!!,"Thank you Amazon for making so many of these works so easily accessible. And for the low, low price of FREE!! Yes, many works are out of copyright, but so what? You are still stocking and delivering these titles for free or low cost. Where else could I possibly get 2,500 pages of literature for 99 cents or free?! This is a wonderful service Amazon, Thank you, Thank you!! Many titles, esp. out of copyright ones, are available elsewhere on the internet, but WHY would I want to go elsewhere when you provide such an excellent and easy to use repository??As for our UK friend, perhaps you could google the term ""proxy server"".Thank you Amazon."
1,I have had enough of being told Kindle books are not available in the UK,"Like - virtually no Yeats, no Blackwood. Come on, amazon. These books went out of copyright aeons ago. I'm also severely hacked off with your MP3 downloads policy. You are in a global market. No good pretending otherwise. What you are doing now with these nasty little rules and censorships is royally p***ing off your customers. NB: there are NO Kindle books on amazon.co.uk. None. not even the silly novels by lady novelists. Please, please rectify these anomalies soon and show yourselves to be a properly global business."
5,Made Me Dance!!!!!,"why aren't these guys famous yet? this album is sooo cool! a little reggae, a little dave matthews-like guitar riffin', some very sweet horn work and what do you get: not your ordinary pop!! so much better than most of the garbage on the radio. i dug it. there are a few weak tracks, buy there are those on most top ten albums. you'll love night groove, as the sun goes down and st rhythemus trane! sweet stuff!"
5,VOODOO SORCERY GRIMOIRE,"This book is worth the effort! I don't know about you but I am tired of buying and trying different books, one after another that the rituals do not work.. If you are serious about finding rituals that really do work, about feeling power when you open the book, and when you turn the pages, then try this book. These rituals really work! How do I know? I have tried many of them and with success! At first the idea of working with the dead scared me, but it truly works and besides the book is not only about that, it has a whole lot more to offer. Whether you are novice or a practioner, you need to read this book. It is a winner! The rituals are tried and used, not just made up to look good! You will not be disappointed! Personally I think this book is 100% and if you read it and try the rituals, I believe you will too!"
2,Dreadful!,"I don't know what book the others read, but it wasn't the one I read. The writing was awful, the grammar was terrible, the layout was horrendous. The spells never worked either."
3,Got Batista t-shirt,It was great because I could not find a Batista shirt in this large of a shirt anywhere. It was so overpriced though and I still did not get it before Christmas. 27.00 when it was all said and done.
1,Charged twice.,"I wanted to replace the one I lost for my local public library. They recommended me to order it online through Amazon.com or pay $40.00. I went to Amazon.com & the price was reasonable ( about $15.00 regular shipping ). I entered the order but message said that did not go through , then I placed the order again. I received the cd by mail & took them to the public library. I saw that there were 2 of them but who knew that they were 2 separate orders. I came to find out when I looked at my credit card statement that I was charged over $40.00. Not only I saved nothing but wasted time for no reason. I was very frustrated. Definitely, the worst experience ever."
4,Princess Sing Along,"If you have little girls that love princesses and love to dance around and pretend that they're one too, this is the perfect present for them!"
2,Not worth the money,My 6 year old watched half of this and walked away. I have not been able to convince her to watch it again. This is a girl who worships all things Princess.
4,Great songs for all generations,"I hate to put on a full length movie for my four year old, so these 45 minute sing alongs are great! And if you love all the Disney princess movies you will love this sing along. When you hear the songs it will take you back to childhood. My daughter loves to sing to the songs and dance through the room! I highly recommend this DVD!"
5,The Best Volume of the 3 Princess Sing Alongs,"Very much worth the money. Do not buy any other volume of Princess Sing Alongs or even the Princess Story line of movies. This dvd has a few songs from some sequels: Little Mermaid 2 and Return of Jafar, but it has all of the original Princess movies represented - except Aladdin. ""Kiss The Girl"" is in here from Little Mermaid. The other Princess Sing Alongs have many songs from sequels. So if you want to give yourself to the brainwashing marketing program of Disney - Buy the other Sing Alongs or the Princess Stories.The DVD has an auto-repeat function if you need to get a lot done (meaning - do housework while your princess is glued to the TV). (I think it's 40 minutes or so without repeat).AWESOME DVD!!!!"
5,Parents....you have been warned!!!,"My daughter is almost three and she is obsessed with this DVD, all day long its ""tea party mommy, princess tea party"" Oh yeah we have watched this at least a hundred times, she will watch it over and over again. theres also a dance-a-long in the bonus features and she learns the moves and puts on her dresses and dances with the girls. This is a must have for all the little princesses out there but parents be afraid be very afraid, you may lose your mind fromt he repetition ahhhhh! lol!"
5,Disney Princess Sing along volume 2,Item arrived when seller said that it would. It was in great condition. Thanks.
5,passportholder,What a wonderful product! I travel during the year and am always fumbling for necessary documentation. This item puts everything safely at my fingertips and the attached cord is also a wonderful feature. Bought one for my friend and is thrilled with it.
5,Kleiber Plus Vienna Philharmonic Equals Great Strauss,"I doubt I have heard the music of the Strauss family played with such empathy and warmth by the Vienna Philharmonic. Under Carlos Kleiber's baton, the Vienna Philharmonic gives brisk, magnificient performances of the Strauss family's best known works, ranging from Johan Strauss Jr.'s ""Blue Danube Waltz"" to Johan Strauss' ""Radetzky March"". I believe this recording is from the celebrated 1989 New Year's Day Concert conducted by Carlos Kleiber. Much to my surprise, I have stumbled upon the definitive live performance of these works."
3,It's worth it for the graphics and layouts,"This was the first Scrapbook program I bought (I know have three, this one, Scrapbook Factory, and Microsoft Picture It) and I was really disappointed with the user interface - especially the part about cropping photos.I don't do traditionally scrapbooking where you have to use scissors and glue (yuck!). I was also upset to discover that you can't bring in cropped images because Hallmark Scrapbook Studio loses the transparency.But the graphics are beautiful. The layouts are very good starting points. And, I just export everything to another program.One last thing, the licensing agreement allows you to use the graphics for business use as for as I can tell.So I can't recommend it to as THE scrapbooking program to get but then again I couldn't do that for any of the programs that I've tried. I plan on getting Scrapbook Studio 2 - just to get more graphics."
1,Don't buy it!,I have Hallmark card studio 1 and 2 and I enjoy them immensely.. Then I bought the 'Scrapbook Studio'. I can not believe how hard it is to use. My husband and I have spent hours trying to figure it out. A lot of the art is good but the program should be scrapped. Hallmark should never have put their name on this one.
3,A little disappointed - slow product!,"After using the American Greetings Card product, and all its features, I was a bit disappointed with Scrapbook Studio which was supposed to work with so well with digital photos. There is NO photo editing, like croping, etc. like there is with the AG software. Adding text boxes is NOT user friendly and is very very slow. The grapics are nice, and so are the ideas, but it would be nice if you could work more with the digital photos."
1,Poor Work,"This is a very shoddy product. You have to restart your computer not once, but twice. It makes you install MDAC components, which is a huge no-no in a consumer app. This can lead to all sort of dll version problems with other apps. The JPG file names are also cryptic, so you can't even salvage that from the program. Save your cash for a more deserving product, this should be free-ware."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this product. Although it comes with a lot of beautiful graphics, trying to insert digital pictures into the collages is one big headache. Trying to size the pictures correctly is almost impossible. I would not recommend this product."
1,The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography,"I found this publication while looking for a book written by Ruben Berrios Martinez. The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography mistakingly states that Mr. Berrios Martinez was born in 1930 and died in 1993. In addition, the reviewed excerpt states that Mr. Berrios Martinez was the Puerto Rico Independence Party until 1993. Both factoids are false. First, Mr. Berrios Martinez was born in 1938 and is gladly alive and well. Furthermore, he is still the President of the Puerto Rico Independence Party. Among Mr. Berrios Martinez's contributions, he is one of the founding members of the COPPPAL (Conferencia Permanente de Partidos Politicos de America Latina), is a respected and reputed member of the Socialist International. While I was focused on Mr. Berrios Martinez's biography, I wonder how many more inaccurate facts are included in this publication. So much for the ""dictionary"".The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography"
4,He did a good job on this documentary!,"I had only learned of this incident this passed Thanksgiving and being that I lived so close to this house and didn't know about what had happened, I wanted to see it. The director did a good job putting all the information together that he found and it's a sad tragedy that happened to this family. There are few things that instantly popped into my mind though (some questions that were not asked), but it's hard to go back after all these years and try to fit all the pieces together. Although greed does seem to be the reason based on this documentary, there are other things that may have played a factor in what happened, too! Just my thoughts!"
1,High School Film Class Meets Mediocre Crime,"Unfortunately ""Real Crime"" enthusiast buy just ONE too many DVD's in their quest for entertaining investigative documentaries and they happen upon a low budget disaster such as this.The DVD cover ""teaser"" which asks, ""Who killed this Family?"" should have been enough of a warning of why this crime missed media attention, and should have been passed over by anyone making a serious and professional true crime documentary. Your answer halfway through this feature will undoubtably be.......""WHO CARES!!!""Inotherwords..........don't waste your money on this terribly produced, horribly narrated, and completely inaffective film about nothing!"
3,Great Boogie. Poor Sound,"This is an unfair review. The performance is great and I love Boogie. Whats my problem ? The recordings are way too old to be fully enjoyable. If you can get past that, buy it !"
3,Not as good as her other work,"As a big fan of Edna Buchanan's, I eagerly picked up this book and dove in. About a third of the way in, I had a pretty good idea what was going to happen and, despite that, I was dismayed at the ending. I felt rather gypped, because the main ""hero"" never had a chance at happiness. The three things that he cared about in this world met a grisley demise! And also, I think no one who loves another could be so dense, but that's just my opinion. But on a good note, Buchanan accurately portrays the South Florida night. If you're a big fan of hers, read it. If not, go to one of the better novels."
1,Nobody Lives Forever,"Really a disappointing book. I had heard Edna Buchanan had some good mysteries, so searched for the first one she published. The characters were all unbelievable - from the homicide detective who takes home a crazy speeding driver because he is so attracted to her to the goofy parents who let the dangerously deranged woman be out on her own ""hoping"" she will get better. When the kitten was put in the garbage disposal, I knew I should put this book down. However, I continued on in order to see what Buchanan was all about. Terrible ending - every single main character meets a horrible disgusting demise. - I am debating whether to try one of her later books. With so many excellent mystery writers around, I am not sure I will bother."
3,Book is clear but flawed.,I am always frustrated with publications that obviously lacked a critical eye during the editing process. This book is helpful for those in need of simplistic information re: databases (relational and OODB) but will certainly confuse if reader doesn't take time to sort through several ill communicated examples.
2,Curiously edited badly,"This is my first database book as I'm thinking of a big career change, and on the surface as I initially flipped through this book at a bookstore, I thought the layout looked newbie-friendly. However, even with my lack of ""tech"" knowledge, I caught a lot of careless errors strewn throughout the book, and not so nominal (e.g., contradictions in definitions). But so far, I've been able to solve the errors without difficulty, and learn something from this book, although many examples they use to illustrate concepts can be difficult to follow. Hopefully, if this book makes it to a 2nd edition, significant revisions will have been made with more careful editing.Most of the previous reviews for this book have been pretty accurate (I don't always agree with the reviews on Amazon), and I regret not heeding them in purchasing this book."
3,a little disappointing . . .,"I ordered this tea in search of a good chai in a tea bag. (My favorite is Harney & Sons ""Indian Spice"" but it is a loose tea, pretty expensive, they make tea bags, too, but they are even more expensive.) So I was on a mission to find a really good chai, with less mess. The spice in this chai is great, tastes very good, but it is lacking tea flavor and body, if I put too much milk in it, it over powers the tea altogether. It just seems watery to me, maybe I'll try 2 tea bags per cup. I really relied on the reviews above and the worst part is I bought the 6-pack and now I have all this tea I really don't care for."
3,Decent but not for me,"My opinion is that it's a very weak chai. Hardly spicy! Everyone has different tastes. I prefer to make my own so that it has some heat to it. Contrary to what another reviewer said, it doesn't take hours or cost a lot more. It cost about the same as one box to buy all of the spices. It takes just a couple of minutes to make yourself."
4,Flavorful,Delicious spicy black tea. You can sweeten and add milk if you like it that way. Better than the chai found in some famous coffee places!
5,Accurate and Prophetic,"This book is very accurate prophesy as to what would happen when abortion became legal in any country that legalized it. First came taking life in the womb before it is born, then came taking it in infancy (i.e ""Baby Doe"" cases in the 1980's, China's infanticide of second children and our country's Susan Smith murder case and ""prom parents"" in the 1990's). A must for those who think abortion, infanticide and euthanasia are ""rights"" that are freely chosen."
1,101 Biggest Mistakes 3rd Year Medical Students Make: And How,"This book basically picks up certain points from the First Aid for the Wards. There are not 101 mistakes..some are repeats. As well, these mistakes are common sense. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! It's a waste of money. The First Aid for the Wards goes into much more detail and it has high yield facts for each rotations."
3,Easy read,"Easy to read, nice readable text, but not really necessary and the information inside is not really novel or useful at the medical student level. If you are still in college and applying for medical school it's probably a good read."
2,Ok,"I read this book and summarized what it said in 3 pages of typed notes. Basically just read a lot, be friendly and upbeat, and shine in the spotlight any chance you can. Could have been a lot shorter. There are not 250 mistakes but probably 100, as many are repeated and most are obvious mistakes you would already know about. I'd compare it with tarascons or nerds guide to prerounding."
1,Not a worthwhile purchase,"Unfortunately, this book fails to deliver much useful information to the new student intern. Most of what is said is common sense and many of the mistakes mentioned are repeated later and counted as separate mistakes even though the author is really talking about the same mistake again. Very disappointing."
1,Worthless,"I read this when I was a 3rd year medical student. It's truly terrible. I don't have the book any longer to quote some of its drivel, but imagine a book that provides the great advice of ""Not writing SOAP notes on time"" and ""Not being prepared for wards.""As another reviewer notes, this is all common sense. Spend your money on a stiff glass of whiskey. That will do you more good on your third year than this book."
3,eh,"I found this book helpful to go over at the beginning of 3rd year to get an idea of things and sort of orient myself a bit, but not much beyond that. 3rd year clerkship evaluations are so totally subjective that if you try to set a list of things to do or not to and think it'll make a universal difference, then you'll be sorely disappointed and unsuccessful. Some things that some attendings/residents/teams really liked others really hated. Basically, you just have to figure out how to fit in with the group you're working with, and you can't learn that from a book."
4,Electrospective,"Nice album! Not so commercial as many electro albums that came out at the same time.Musics are not so catchy. You have to listen sometimes before you place it as one of the bests you know.I found it very introspective, so I usually listen to it while working.****"
4,"Overall, a pretty good product","When I first tried my EB-3 in my Jet tablesaw, I had a serious problem with the guide bar binding in both mitre slots. At first, I thought the guide bar was warped on the head end. After futher investigation, which included disassembling the unit, the guide bar was indeed dead flat and straight. The culprit turned out to be the guide washer, more specifically the tongue that the guide washer is screwed into. The tongue is about 1/32"" too thick, making the washer bind in the slot. After I filed the washer down and reattached it, everything worked fine. Of course, I knocked the unit out of square disassembling it, but recalibrating it was easy. It's dead on now."
3,Good design - but did'nt live up,"I was very excited when Santa brought me a long awaited EB-3. The design was great and very simple to use. It had everyting you could ask for in a miter gauge, except vertical accuracy. The fence was out of square in relation to the table. I first thought it was a manufacturing flaw, so I exchanged it for a new one. It had the same problem. I simply could not rely on it for vertical accuracy in relation to the table, A major drawback. Also, I ended up disliking the way it scratched the table as I used it. I ended up returning the EB-3 and getting a Woodhaven deluxe with an extended fence, which has worked out very well for my needs."
2,Problems with Osborne EB-3,"I tried the Osborne EB-3 and I was disappointed.I first tried it at 45 degrees to the left and it worked good, next I tried it at 90 degrees and again it worked good. The problem came when I set it to 45 degrees to the right. With the miter gauge set to 45 degrees to the right the adjustment and support bar was set to it's longest setting and since there was very little of the solid black square rod inside of the hollow red square tube, they flexed upward when pressure was applied to the part that the board rests against and as a result, there was 2 or 3 degrees of play in the miter gauge when it is set to 45 degrees to the right."
5,Great tool for mitering and crosscutting!!!,"I just don't know how I've ever done any woodworking without this tool! This is a must for my table saw. To tell the truth, I decided to purchase it after I reviewed Norm Abram's comment about it. It definitively worth's its cost... and improves my cutting precision! I strongly recommend it!"
2,misleading,"I was extremely disappointed to discover (after waiting 3 weeks BTW), that this thing is imported. There was absolutely no country of origin info anywhere I could find (on any of the online catalogs or in the mfr website). So: know that you are paying top dollar for something apparently made in a Chinese sweatshop.It seems to work decent, but the angle adjustment is not all that smooth...maybe something is bent in the one I have.Wish I'd bought the Incra...."
1,I would love to rate the EB-3 but ...,"I would love to rate the EB-3 but I just cancelled the order from Amazon which was placed 5 weeks ago with its new (fourth change) estimated ship date 3+ weeks out. I guess that now they raised the price $25, Amazon can commit to the sale. My first bad experience with Amazon. Too bad."
3,you can do better,"The I Fish Walleye is cute if you are from the mid-west. The other songs did not do much for us. It is in our collection, but not much play time."
4,Good choice!!!!,"the product came well, the two things that I don't like are: 1. They could do better on the backside because it leaves a opennig. 2. That the mask should be like a helmet covering the backside also, overall nice costume."
3,Mediocre product,"For one who is handicapped, this product may be a Godsend. I don't know for sure. For me, it does not work very well. However, it is possible it is just me, and maybe somebody else can make it work better."
1,not in the amazon add..,"This game is from 1997. the add on Amazon does not include the system requirements for the game.. My Mac is from 2008 and I could not get it to load (says Classic Versions no longer supported). I had no issues returning the game just disappointed because i was really looking forward to playing it.. Michael was fantastic to deal with regarding the problem, I will be buying from him again.."
2,Not Sure...Keep or Return...,"I am not happy with this set, the workmanship is poor, threads are tight in spots on most of the guides, hard to start nut onto guide. Not polished, but that's not a big deal and the other things I can fix. But these are new, why should I have to fix things that are new out of the box... Not Sure...Keep or Return... I have returned this item, the poor machining and quality are to hard to put up with when I produce quality items I expect to use the same."
2,no centering bit,Got this and realized when I went through the parts that there is NO centering bit. Without this bit (chucks into the router to center the guide bushings on the base plate) the bit you use is NOT centered in the bushing. What good is that? Without it it's all a piece of brass junk.
5,Great Sky River (Galactic Center),"I haven't reed it yet, but I'm hope it's like the rest of Benfords books"
4,Best in the series so far,"I've read all the books in the series up through this one. This was by far the best even though (or perhaps, because) its setting is new.The plot was tense and kept me turning pages. The main characters were sympathetic and engaging. A very good sci fi read - I highly recommend it.However, unfortunately, I think slogging through all the previous books burned me out on the series in general. At the end of this book I had lost interest in reading the next book. Maybe I'll pick it up sometime, but it doesn't feel likely.If you're new to this series, consider starting with this book and then reading the remaining books. Then go back to the first books in the series if you're still interested enough."
4,From the Privates View,"It was so fun to read a book on the Revolutionary War that was from the view of the private. No huge battles here, just the day to day struggle on what he endured and why he endured all the hardships. Made me really admire the commitment they made."
5,Quite a character,"Told like a story from an old New Englander (which of course he is), JPMartin spins a great story, full of wry and witty observations, some of which made me laugh out loud. But it's far from a comedy, it's a tale of our becoming a nation and the battles and strife of life at that time. Anyone and everyone with a sense of the history of the United States should read this and see the perspective of a common man who is the true American Hero."
3,Black marks,The black pad on this sander will leave black marks on your wood so be careful when sanding.
5,Strategic and effective!,This books provide comprehensive strategies that are easy to undestand and apply in NCLEX. I just started preparing for NCLEX and have been more motivated to study because of this book.Thanks and happy reviewing!
5,Man cave,"Great deal from the warehouse, its metal and painted well. hung it up during 7th inning stretch, Go Red Soxs"
1,do not try to learn contemporary world cinema from this book,"The writer must be so brave to title her book ""contemporary world cinema"". It misses so many very important contemporary directors and films that you need a long time to make a list. To give an example I really have difficulty to understand why she mentions a movie like ""Bend It Like Beckham"" while explaining European cinema and does not even mention Bela Tarr or Haneke for instance. She talks about Korean cinema without mentioning Kim Ki-duk! In addition the sections are not balanced, she gives a longer account for South Asian cinema, probably because she knows it better! So do not try to learn contemporary cinema through this book."
4,MORIBITO SERIES PACK 1,"In a fictional version of Japan, the spearwoman Balsa saves the life of the second prince Chagum. This act draws her into palace intrigue and the fate of the nation.Chagum, given by his mother to a total stranger, must learn to live as an ordinary child. No longer a son of heaven he adapts to his new life, without losing his intrinsic sense of right and wrong. He never loses his attachment to his parents and older brother.These two DVD's played fine."
3,more Frog and Toad than Curious George,"This is a nice, classically animated DVD. However, I was disappointed that the majority of the DVDs running time is devoted to the ""Frog and Toad"" stories, with only one Curious George story included. This video should really be called ""Frog and Toad stories, with a bonus Curious George episode""."
2,curious george comes to america,"This is not what I thought it was, I thought it was a cartoon as illustrated on cover but it was not,my granddaughter seems to like it, she has watched it a couple of times, however, I did not like it."
3,Old Style... Kids didn't care for it.,"I loved this old style Curious George! Very reminiscent of when I was young! But the kids watched it once or twice and didn't ever ask for it again. When I said I was taking it to the resale shop, they just answered ""ok""... so I guess they didn't think it was as neat as I did :-)"
1,Hated it!,My three year old refuses to watch this video because The Man in the Yellow Hat SMOKES! And so does George!!!!
3,"Some good moments, but don't think about it too much","Because if you do, the story loses some plausibility and credibility. On the face of it, Grossman presents a very well crafted urban tale with some very touching characters. The themes of loyalty, courage and honesty are clearly presented for the reader--for the young reader especially. The action/story line is both the book's strength and weakness. Even with the frequent chronological switchbacks, the plot is effectively advanced. Where I had problems with the book was in accepting the absence and or disinterest of the parents of the protagonists. Unfortunately, those absences and disinterest were necessary to allow the teenage principals to move toward the story's climax. In retrospect, this device was hard to credit.In general, an okay story, especially as a kind of coming of age tale for teenagers."
2,An unpleasant read.,"It's difficult to rate this book because I can't figure out if it is the author or the translation that is so bad. I suspect it is the latter but have no way of knowing. The story is not that original, the characters are not that likable and the phrasing in the English translation is awkward and, at times, nonsensical. I cannot recommend this book."
5,Someone to Run With,I had no idea what I was about to read. David Grossman captured my interst immediately. I could not put my book down. I could picture these street kids performing and all of Tamars friends when I was not reading. I have not found a book yet to replace it.
5,Hieroglyphics Make Beautiful Music....,"I just bought this cd ealier today after hearing the 5 sample cuts here on Amazon. MAN! You can't truly appreciate what it will sound like till you hear it in-person on a nice system. There is not 1 wack track on this album, not 1. I don't dig jingle-jangle much, but it still isn't bad. There are so many great cuts on this cd. I love the overall sound. As for not enough bangers, UM, ya right. This cd has tons of bass heavy songs with lots of original bass lines. This is 1 of the best cd's I have bought lately and 1 of the best I own overall. I put it up there with Shadows on The Sun, and ya know that joint is HOT. Enjoy this, this is real hip-hop!"
1,I regret burning this album,"I loved 3rd eye vision and almost anything hiero put out before that excluding ""fear its self"" and ""no mans land"". However this album is just weak, i regret wasting a blank cd to burn it. The beats are medicore and the lyrics stick to the same old formula. What made hiero good in the 90's was the fact that they had something different to say from all the fake gangsta rap out there. But now hiero has unfortunatly fallen off this album is as wack as a souls of mischef live show(if you've even seen one you know what i'm talking about. If you want to hear some dope hiero pick up the pep love album. peace."
5,#1,"Best album of 2003 period!!! They have that nice balance of growth with their music and still keeping flows strong! It's like they're were truly born to do this, truly. A Banger form beggining to end! Warning: Favorite track will change at each listen!!"
3,Ain't no 3rd Eye Vision.,"This album is not bad, but it just doesn't have the banger tracks like 3rd Eye Vision had. First, let me list a few things I didn't like:(1) Not enough super-tight beats like ""You Never Knew"". IMO, the beat on ""Love Flowin'"" is totally cluttered and is really just a mess of clashing sounds.(2) Not enough Del. Seems like he is just ""featured"".(3) Not one scratch on the whole mo fo. Turntablism is a part of hip-hop and some nice cutting always adds to the flavor of a hip-hop track.I do like some of the tracks on this album, especially ""Classic"", but there is no way I can give this album 5, or even 4 stars. In this day and age though, I feel like I should give Hiero 5 stars just for not selling out and doing some Lil' John Booty shakin' nonsense."
4,Sick.,"Every track on this cut is sick. Every single one. I popped this in the stereo and never had to skip a track, which is rare for many albums now-a-days. Hell, Halo alone is worth the price of admission. The only complaint I really have is the little Del is heard. However, every chance he gets to spit, it's a thing of beauty. Hook yourself up, Hiero's got the best MCs in rap music, indi OR commercial."
4,Orthopaedic Review,"A very complete text. However the format is not perfect for study review purposes. There is a lot of wasted space in the text with notes on the left and diagrams and tables on the right and following pages. Sometimes when your scanning, reviewing,you have to flip back and forth to see which diagrams relate to which topic. Other than that it is a fine text.Razz"
4,Hard to deciepher,"This is the second How to Host a Murder game I have played and the first for the other 7 guest I invited. We had a blast. I was suprized how much the men got into it. I must admit that it was beyond impossible to figure out who the murderer was and the audio tape was quite confusing as it just starts with almost no set up. Other than that a fun time was had by all. If you love dinner parties, James Bond, and detective work this is a good Murder game for you. The only down side to these games is that you really can only play them once, however my sister and I swap the games we own with one another thus doubling their playability."
2,Not very practical,This book lost me in the first few chapters. It's a bit too philosophical and not practical enough for me. I'm more of a git-r-done person and prefer concrete action I can put into practice instead of exercises focused on what I think or feel. I prefer business books written by business experts rather than massage therapists in general. I recommend Word of Mouth Marketing by Sernovitz if you're new and The Big Book of Small Business by Gegax for existing business owners.
4,Worthwhile reading,"I was very pleased with this book. I would recommend to any health professional. It is very helpful to anyone trying to start or improve a business so that ideas can be put in an orderly manner conducive to building a career. It is also useful to someone in a career as an employee because it deals not only with owning a business but with managing a career and a life. This book sets up a matrix upon which personal and professional life can be integrated for the greatest fulfillment of its user. The book is full of ideas, and is especially good with instructions on developing a strategic operating plan. Before reading this book, the reader should have some experience as a decision maker for a business or have taken a few college courses in business."
5,outstanding product,I was replacing door casing in my house so I ordered these to ensure nice tight 45 fits. They work like a charm. they pull the 45 nice and tight so you can nail and have a great seam.. would reccomend to anyone. very happy with Amazon prime.
3,"Not what it Promises, but Certainly Not Horrible","I agree with another reviewer who said this book would be good for new believers. Beyond that, it just doesn't lack personality and is really no different than any Christian self-help book for women. While I agree that the message may ultimately be the same, Rebecca St. James is supposed to be good at delivering that message in a slightly unique way and in that area, this book fell flat. I think women can handle much more depth than this and as far as the ""new definition of feminism"" this book is supposed to offer, I didn't see anything ""new"". People don't need to be reminded of statistics, they just want something real to apply to their lives. The double authorship makes me wonder if St. James really even wrote any of it, or just got to stick her name on there because of who she is. Her devos were awesome, but after that her other books just haven't packed the same punch."
1,wow,....a huge disappointment. I choose to be anonymous because I am a St. James fan but I do NOT agree with the things she says in this book. In this book she's close-minded and ignorant about the realities of the world. She should spend more time in a secular university then in an ingenuous bible school if she wants to gain knowledge that'll impact the world.
3,Great buy BUT lousy service,"I bought this TV after looking at a lot of competitors especially the Panasonic 42 inch plasma. It arrived fine but when I tried to hook up the HD cable box...NO HD. Tried with the other two cable boxes that time warner offers in NYC and neither worked but both worked on my Plasma HD Toshiba that I have. Therefore the problem was with the TV. I called Philips and they sent someone over to look at my TV and it turns out there is something wrong with the input controls for the HD in my TV. I guess I wasn't the only one with the problem, a bunch more customers in NYC with the same TV have the same problem. I figured Philips would fix it. Turns out they can't even locate the part and if they can't find it in a month then they will replace the TV. Am on week 4 right now so we'll see. Basically, don't buy this TV, buy the panasonic."
1,Stay Away From This Flat Screen!,I am sad to say that my experience has been similar to many of the other reviews here. This TV is a LEMON. I have seen some effort to form a class action lawsuit - I will certainly join. The unit just all of a sudden makes a big CRACKING sound and goes blank (black). Then the clicking noises start and eventually the green operational light turns to a blinking red light. If I unplug the TV for 5 minutes and re-plug it in it works for another 10 minutes or so (sometimes it goes for even 30 minutes!) and then the big CRACKING sound again. Absolutely no response from Philips service.This is by far the worst purchase I have ever made - NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A PHILIPS PRODUCT!
2,11 day crap out,"I bought this tv 11 days ago, today march 21st, 2006 the top half of the screen went a little fuzzy and then faded out completely. Nice huh ? [...]"
2,Phillips customer service,"I bought one in the middle of last December, and I noticed immediately that the TV had couple of defects. It has been especially difficult to deal with Phillips customer relation department: 1) There is no supervisor: when I ask for supervisor, I was told by 3 different person on 3 different occasion that she is the highest level person over there I can speak to; 2) There is no ""authorized"" repair services available in my state, TEXAS, and it took them long time to ""authorize"" one to try to fix my TV. 3) I can not say that I am happy about the repair service they provided so far. My TV is still not fixed, yet.Good luck with your purchase."
1,Bad Customer Service,"My TV also had a couple of defects. It has been over a month and the customer service department is absolutely useless. I have faxed them my warranty three times and then I have sent it to them online twice. I am not the type of person to write reviews, but they have been so terrible that I would hate for anyone to purchase one of their products and get involved with this company. AVOID."
1,Last for 22 months,"When it worked, the picture was ok. The sound was bad. Last week, the picture was gone, and the red light was flickering. Mine lasts for 22 months, much longer compare to other people. I thought Philips was a good name, but its TV is definitely a piece of #%@*!"
1,"Please, do not buy this product.","I have this TV for 23 months, today, the screen turned black and I noticed the feared blinking red light. Called support and as soon as I mentioned the red light she said, ""thats not good"". Thanks. Internal problem..you know the rest. I asked her if this is a common problem for a TV thats two years old...she said its ""normal wear and tear"". Thanks again. 2300$ down the toilet. It also had all the other fun problems....screen that will shut off occasionally, green screen. I know there are some of you out there that are satisfied with this TV, I was ok with it until today and after reading everyone elses similar problems, stay away. There is not much difference in picture quality with this than other manufacturers TV's. Why risk it. DO NOT BUY A PANASONIC. I won't...ever."
1,Defective TV received,"I bought this tv direct from Philips. It had 7 lines on the right side from the start (looks like rows of dead pixels). I called and Philips agreed to a return. I was told a shipping carrier would call within 1-2 days. I received no calls. I called Philips again, was put on hold with 3 different people. They told me the request was never sent to the shipper and I had to wait 1-2 days again for the shipper to call for pickup. Still being resolved.This was my 2nd philips tv after a pleasant experience with my first one. I will not be purchasing another philips again."
4,Nice TV for the price,"I bought the refurbished system from philips outlet. This TV works creat. I love it. I want to clarify one muth about not having volume settings display on TV. But that is not right.If you dont see volume settings, follow these stepsOn TV remote press MENU buttonGo to SETUP, then PREFERENCES, then MENU PREFERENCESthen go to OSD, there change settings to NORMALThis will display the volume settings"
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought my TV from Circuit City (with the extended warranty). My TV screen suddenly goes blank often (HDMI- Comcast HDTV) and I have to turn the TV and the cable box off to get it back. It also goes blank suddenly and the only way to fix it is to unplug it. So far not that bothersome, but from other reviews I've read it progressively gets worse."
4,"So far, this is a really great purchase.","Hooking up from the cable box was, as someone else mentioned, a disaster. It looked absolutely terrible, so I have a cablecard being installed this week. We'll see if that fixes it.I have primarily been using it for video games, hooked up to an xbox 360. HD games are incredible looking. I'm in awe. DVDs also look fantastic. That said, I'm assuming/hoping that the cablecard will solve my problems for normal tv watching.The speakers are pretty bad, the remote control is horrible, and overall the user interface seriously needs some help, BUT the picture quality, which is why you'd buy this tv, is what I wanted, and for the price I'm happy (have had it for about a week).update: cablecard, while convenient, and allowing for cleaner installation, the lack of program guide makes it pretty worthless. Get a HD cable box if available."
4,Not Bad Plasma,I have owned this plasma screen for about a year now. I am pretty happy with it so far. The picture is pretty good but not the best. It has enough inputs including 2 hdmi and 3 component inputs. The only thing I really did not like about the tv is the remote and the menu setup.
1,WARNING,"Whatever you do, DO NOT buy a Phillips product. The first time I turned on my 42"" Phillips Plasma TV it had two vertical lines down the left side of the screen. These lines never went away and I have spent the last 8 months trying to get Phillips to fix or replace the TV. Their customers service is not just bad or non-existent, it sucks. Never again will I buy a Phillips product. Buy the Panasonic- its a better deal anyway."
4,"So far, so good","Not the top of the line like Pioneer or Panasonic, but this is a really solid plasma HDTV. The Pioneer or Panasonic can cost $700 - $1000 more, so I don't think you can justify the added expense. The picture quality on this is really good. I have a couple HD channels, but still mostly digital cable and analog. The picture look sharp."
1,"Piece of Junk, pathetic customer service","I have had the same expereince as Joe of Houston and T Amin of NYC. I bought the TV middle of Dec and stopped working after 2 weeks. Stays on for 5 minutes.Philips could not locate a support center, then cannot find the part and customer service is pathetic, no supervisor, do not do anything. Then they sent the wrong part, then they refused to do anything about it. The TV is not a phone to return to the store easily. Customer support is indifferent and threatens to make your life difficult if you complain. THere is no way to complain against some of the rude representatives.It is still not fixed. That is $2000+ of not working stuff."
1,"Subpar sound, bad customer service","The TV itself is not terrible -- the picture is ok, but the sound is definitely subpar, as noted by others. Often it is difficult to understand soft dialogue from the TV speakers. Where I would warn others is Philips customer service; if anything goes wrong with the TV, I wouldn't count on getting any response from Philips. I had an issue with the CableCARD reader, and all I got was misinformation and delay tactics from customer service. I upgraded the software, and got the cable company to come out 3 times for various tests all demanded by Philips, after which they assured me they would fix or replace the set. After 4 months, they finally admitted they weren't going to fix the problem. ""You bought the TV, so it's your problem not ours"" was basically their answer. Short of taking them to court, and it isn't worth that hassle, I really have no way of getting them to honor their warranty. I'm sure Philips is well aware of that fact."
1,NEVER BUY PHILIPS PLASMA TV,"PLEASE NEVER BUY PHILIPS PLASMA TV .I bought this palsma from sears ,paid almost $2000.what a nightmare-open and close by itself then finally the FAMOUS PROBLEM [all over the intenet] the blinking red light that will cost $800to fix -PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY THE HEADACHE AND MONEY ,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
1,worst purchase ever,Purchased at SAMs because their demo had great picture & sound. First one had vertical lines. Exchanged it. Second one turned off after two minutes. Returned it for a refund. No more Philips!!
1,Worst TV ever,"We've had the TV for a couple of years. Now it turns off on its own. Phillips recommends we buy a part that will cost more than $500 to replace. After 2 years? No thanks. I can replace the entire TV for that. Worst TV ever. I won't be buying a Phillips product ever again. Before you buy this TV, search the web for all the complaints. You will be amazed. Better yet, don't buy Phillips."
3,"Great planer, cheesy fence","I bought this planer several months ago, largely on the strength of Bosch's reputation and my satisfaction with the 4410 sliding compound miter saw. The planer works like a dream, the plastic carrying case is well made and the chip collector bag keeps your work area clean, but Bosch should be ashamed to sell that cheesy stamped steel fence with such a fine tool.It is impossible to adjust the fence accurately because it torques, allowing the two locking knobs to be tightened at different settings. No matter, the markings are inaccurate and hard to read anyway, and the mere act of tightening the knobs causes their settings to change. It is supposed to adjust from 135 to 90 degrees, but mine reaches only about 92 degrees at the stops, making it worthless for making a square cut.Buy the planer if you will, but don't bother trying to use the fence."
2,Agree about poor quality,"Most of my tools are made by Bosch, but recent purchases have made me concerned about the direction of the company. I'm willing to pay a premium for higher quality tools, but will not pay more for a brand name. This planer is an embarrassment to the Bosch name. Zero setting removes material and the sole plate is completely out of alignment. It might be suitable as a rough material remover but not acceptable as a finishing product. Bosch needs to improve the quality of their products or start charging the same prices a Hitachi."
2,Poor Quality Control,"Like an earlier reviewer, the unit I purchased had shoes that weren't in alignment with each other. The front (adjustable) shoe seemed twisted, and wasn't aligned to the blades. There is no obvious provision for adjustment.It was quite a disappointment, as Bosch makes some fantastic tools, and this planer has some great features."
1,Very Poor Planner,"I purchased this tool several months ago and have been very disappointed with it every since I received it. I first noticed that the front and rear soles were not in alignment so it is impossible to make an even cut. I took the thing apart to see if there was an adjustment to level the soles and found none. The problem lies with the case which itself is misaligned. As I see it, the only way to fix this problem is for Bosch to retool the mold for the plastic case. Also the spring for the spring loaded park rest is not strong enough, so the park rest hardly ever drops down. After using the plane I have to let the motor come to a complete stop before I set it down. The only use I have for this tool is for preliminary rough surfacing of hardwood which has been cut with a chain saw."
2,Poor Quality Fence,"Bosch should be ashamed of putting such a poor quality fence on this product. As other reviewers mentioned, it is almost impossible to get it to 90 degrees. You're more likey to get an accurate cut using the tool without the fence and estimating the angle. Aside from the fence issue, the tool is well built."
2,"Not a ""door"" planer","What I should say is: It is not for a door expert. The planer is great but the bevel guide adjusts in the opposite direction from most ""door"" planers. This is a problem because if you have the door on a saw horse, you will have to flip the door over to get the bevel going the correct way. Also then your marks would be on the opposite side if you mark on the high side. Otherwise is very nicely made with good features.I bought this for another door installer and he promptly returned it due to the backwards fence."
4,Given as a Christmas gift.,"This was my son's choice for Christmas. I'm sure he researched what he wanted. I haven't heard any complaints from him, so he must like it."
1,1594K Planer,"I have several bosch tools and I am normally a fan or their products, but this planer was likely one of the worst purchases I've made in a long time. Like many other reviews have already stated, the front and back sleds of this planer do not lay parallel to one another and there is no method for adjusting the angle. I've tried adjusting the blade to align with each plane, but it still seems to cut with a slight angle. Can't seem to find a use for mis-aligned cuts. Needless to say, this planer is going back."
2,Poor Alignment,"This is probably the worst tool investment I have made in years. The problem is: The front bottom plate is not parallel with the rear bottom plate. If you eyeball from the front one side of the front plate is about 1/16 out of parallel with the back plate. Edges are not square, surfaces have deep edge gouges. There is no way to adjust this. The body is a cast hard plastic and in the case of my tool (and a few others I've seen in the reviews) there is a misalignment that causes the front plate to cock to one side.I'm saving up for another one. I will buy the next one after checking the alignment in the store."
2,"Needs a trigger lock, not a trigger safety.","Alot of tools these days have trigger saftey guards, especially cordless tools. While this may seem safe for your average homeowner, 90% of the guys on my crew always swear at them. Why? Because they want the dexterity for controling the cut, many of which are made in precarious unleveraged positions. Sound dangerous...well thats building. I'm not saying take your blade guard off and install a trigger lock on your skillsaw; but when I light up a planer, I like to lock it on and tune..less trigger fatigue...ask any one with framers elbow. I have a Hitachi F30A, two Makita 1900Bs and a Ryobi L1121, all have trigger locks and when its time to rock n roll and straight edge, the crew leaves the Bosch in the box."
5,The magnificent american contralto,"When my father came home one evening with that 33 1/3 record and put it on the pick-up, in late fifties of last century, I thought it was a man and a woman singing those marvelous spirituals. There was no cover photo, but only a painting: a profile of a black woman on a blue wall. I will never forget that day. Marian Anderson will remain for me one of the most exiting voices of all time."
5,heavenly,"This recording is exceptionally beautiful and moved me to tears at times. Ms. Anderson is able to convey the sorrowful sentiment of the spirituals from her heart. The contralto timbre of her voice has never been equalled by anyone in my opinion.The remastering of the music is excellent. For anyone who loves the magnificent simplicity of spirituals, this CD is a must. It contains the familiar ones and also some which I had never heard."
3,"Brilliant voice, perhaps too heavy for all tastes","Like many of my generation, I know Marion Anderson more in a historical than a musical context. I wanted to get to know her for what she was best known for--a strong woman with a strong voice.The recordings are well preserved and I'm glad I've listened to them, but I'm afraid her contralto will continue to take time for these ears to grow into. I'm a product of sopranos, and I have to learn to listen with new ears."
3,Decent source of information,This book is good in that it has lots of standard information about the Masons. There are more detailed books and websites out there but this is still a good basic source.
2,Not Much New,"This book is basically a rehash of much old information, with little to instill new debate."
2,The Secret History of Freemasonry : Just The Facts,"Boring! Like reading a book of laws. An end-to-end list of buildings and castle sites makes for a very unintersting read. The ingredients of a great book are here. The depth of research for the facts compiled were impressive, however, this book lacks the word flow of an experienced author."
4,Jeans that fit,"The jeans arrived promptly and fit, immediately. I'm not sure why the picture shows capris (clamdiggers, to date myself) - they're full-length jeans. I like them, great price."
2,These Jeans have Pocket Issues...,"Fit on these jeans was comfortable, but the front pockets are about half the length of a normal pair of jeans. This makes them useless for keeping your keys in, because they might fall out. I had to have the pockets altered. Also, there are no back pockets. Which was surprising, because you kind of think there should be or they are not really 'jeans'."
1,Very Disappointed.,"I have ordered these jeans twice. The first time, I had to return because of the size. Not a problem.So, I ordered again in a different size. Today, the jeans came, the size is fine, but I received a pair of cropped pants instead of jeans. The pants are 4-5 inches shorter than a similar, same brand, pair I already own. I'm not sure that Amazon even offers this style.I have a difficult time finding jeans that fit and I was so hoping that I had found a place to purchase them. Maybe, I'll try again, third times a charm, they say."
2,Runs small,"nice construction, but not true to size. Fit is at least two sizes too small as compared with jeans purchased from Lands End, who are not known to run big in fitted jeans. I am very disappointed, as I was looking forward to these since they were a style cut jus to the waist, and not below like so many other styles.l"
1,Didn't fit by size,"Ordered these pants according to size chart and was very impressed by how quicklythey arrived. However, when I tried them on, they were skin tight and I couldn'tfasten the waist button. Now I'm trying to find out how to return them????"
3,Run a little small!,"I think these run a little small! I ordered the size I usually get in Lee jeans, and they were more than snug. They are nicely made, though, as I expect from Lee, and the fabric has just the right amount of give. I don't like muffin top pants, though, so back they went. I'm getting the next size up."
2,Not true to size,"I read all the reviews. They all said these jeans run a bit large. I'm hard to fit: small waist, larger hips & thighs, so I thought I would order the jeans in the size I usually wear and I would probably be okay. The jeans are too small. Maybe it's just the way I'm built, but I didn't find that they ran large at all. They are nice looking jeans though. I'm losing weight, so I'm going to hang on to them."
5,great if you are tall and plus sizes,"Perfect legth if you are tall and don,t want to wear high heeled shoes with jeans. Many other plus size tall jeans are too long and I am 5'11''."
5,lee women's jeans,These are VERY comfortable - I had surgery a few years back and unless I wear elastic waisted pants I am uncomfortable - I am so glad I found jeans with elastic that look great!
5,Comfortable and flattering jeans,I really like this style of jeans. Their color is great and so is the shape for my body type. They are durable and strong enough to handle camping trips and activities.
2,"size bad, for me","just didn't fit properly and had to return.. Ran big....LEE Jeans are good, but sadly, just not for me.."
4,Very satisfied,The jeans fit perfectly and are very comfortable. This is the second pair I ordered because I liked the first pair so much.
4,Encouraging and enlightening book for moms!,"I bought this book for a church study group and was unable to attend the group after signing up. However, I decided to read the book and do the exercises anyway and I am so glad that I did. This book has humor, great bible verses, and its very relatable to mothers of all ages. I highlighted my favorite parts and still have notecards up around my house to remind myself of certain parts of the book. I high recommend this book to any and all mothers."
5,fantastic book!,This is a wonderful book. A most read for all moms who want to encourage their children to be positive and to live a Christan life. It is an easy read and very uplifting!
3,"Good, but...","Let me say first that I did like this book. I'll probably even read sections of it again. There is true, simple wisdom here that will resonate with any fundamentalist Christian.But...in the first chapter the author quotes modern research in order to denigrate it because it doesn't match her reading of scripture. Most of the rest of the book is based entirely on Biblical reading. She frequently cites Dobson (of Focus on the Family). She has an entire chapter on roles of men and women in marriage that isn't what I would consider mainstream.If you are a fundamentalist Christian you might like this book very much. If not, you might still enjoy it. But maybe not."
4,ok,There were some good things in this one. I did keep it after I was done reading it but it wasn't as deep as I had hoped it would be.
3,Great Reminder,"While nothing in the book was a huge revelation (""your kids model themselves after you,"" ""take care of yourself,"" ""take care of your marriage,"" etc.), it was all a good reminder -- and it was nice to have the Biblical citations to back up the principles. Ladd is a great writer, making the material very easy and entertaining to read."
4,ROOT'N TOOT'N GOOD BOOK,"This book is about Megan trying to collect bugs for her project. She is being ""bugged"" by that and a boy at school named Charlie who is causing trouble for her. Oh yeah and her brother Alexander who buries her bugs really ""bugs"" her too. In this novel Belinda, Megan's friend believes that Charlie likes Megan, but is that true? You'll have to fid out in this high-speed funny book. The book really got me glued to the pages, I hope it also will do the same thing for anyone else who reads this great book."
4,perfect for nature lovers,"can't wait to cook some recipies and wait for the harvest, great stories included and pictures.perfect for the person who wants to stay with nature and whole foods grown from your own garden"
1,All hyped up for nothing...,"I got this game as a gift for my sister and was extremely excited to play it with her (we are both huge fans of the show). We were extremely disappointed. A lot of the game has nothing to do with the show whatsoever. I think we could have probably come up with a better game ourselves. We actually scrapped the rules and made up our own game using the trivia cards. Unfortunately it wasn't much more fun. Unless someone is handing this game out for free, don't waste your time. Don't waste your money either!"
1,"Complete waste of time, money and energy","This is the most inane game I have ever played. And I have played some real losers. All four of us are avid ""Housewives"" fans, and all of us hated the game. The questions are so impossibly hard it is unreal, the ""secrets"" are pointless, have little or nothing to do with the game, and are also impossibly hard. Whoever came up with this game to bilk us all out of dollars should be totally ashamed of themselves. ABC--SHAME on you for lending your name to this game. We will tell EVERYONE we know to avoid this game like the plague. RUN AWAY!!!!!!"
1,Wish I could get my money back!,"Myself, my daughter, and son-in-law were so excited to get this game as were are addicted to the show. It was a total waste. Half the cards didn't even rerlate to the show. ""My brother has three nipples"". What the hell is that?"
3,employment consultant,"This package is an excellent resource to help individuals who are stumped by the job search process and placing individual skills and qualifications on paper. The program does it all for you. Of course, if you're one of those selective individual who is looking for personal style, this is not your program. I work with many job seekers who want a quick resume for the regular workforce. People seem to enjoy and relish the product when all you have to do is press enter and the entire personal data is placed into a chronological and targeted format. I would highly recommend this program for anyone wanting a quick fix to marketing their skills. No one should pay hard earned dollars to have someone else prepare a resume. If you can type, this is it!"
1,Very Disappointed,This program did not come close to matching its performance promises. It is basically a glorified word processing program with a few templates. It isn't anything you could not do on your own. Don't waste the $40.00.
1,Not worth it,"I was surprised at the list of unusual job titles to work from, but I couldn't find anything for a plain old 'marketing manager.' If you are proficient in any word processing program, you don't need this, it is just extra work."
5,"Provides Texture, Definition and Volume","Months back, I bought this on a whim and have used it consistently since! Garnier Fructis Style Shake Effect is a non-sticky gel that you ""shake"" and then spray--which instantly turns it into a liquid.This product provides long-lasting style, texture, definition and volume. You can use it on dry hair for the ""messy look"" or use it to define strands and curls.However, I apply it after I wash and towel dry my hair--spraying it on while still damp and letting my hair air-dry. (I've adopted a new style as of late--a wash and wear look with soft curls.) It doesn't leave my hair stiff like some gels, nor does it make the hair look dull, limp or greasy. It's a very light liqui-gel that doesn't weigh down hair--and is easy to comb through, too.Lastly, Garnier Fructis Shake Effect Liqui-Gel smells good--REAL good. It smells like apple, perhaps because of the fruit micro-waxes."
1,Horrific DVD from Disney - NOT appropriate for young children,A relative let us borrow this DVD. My 5 and 3 year old daughters wanted to watch the Jasmin story first. This story is not appropriate for young children. Both my daughters started crying when Jasmin's eyes and tounge turn into a snake. The begged me to turn if off - which I did. They were so upset they couldn't sleep. We spent an hour trying to console them. My oldest daughter kept asking why Disney would make something so horrible. Disney just lost a loyal customer!!!!
1,Not Disney Quality,"I couldn't have been more disappointed when the first story started. The DVD begins with a beautifully-animated sweep of a girl's bedroom (during which I got my hopes up!), but as soon as Ariel enters the story, the quality drops off significantly (and never recovers). The Ariel and Jasmine stories are poorly animated; looks more like cartoons when I was a kid (25 years ago!). The Cinderella story is just clips from the original movie, spliced together. Don't spend your money on this one - Disney certainly did all they could to avoid spending theirs."
2,Not good,"i'm sorry to say that this is not a good video. they rushed to make it and it did not entertain my daughter. she is 17 months. the other disney videos are better. this one only had shots of cinderella, not the actual cinderella character."
1,Disney Princess Stories - Beauty Shines From Within Review,"Well, I thought this would be a good movie for my daughter. I didn't like it at all. My wife and I were very disappointed with this movie. After watching this dvd once we decided NOT to let our daughter watch it again. The cover, title and commercials made it look appealing and delightful. It was terrible! I would expect alot more from a Disney film, especially one made for young girls.I think you should stay away from this one!!"
1,BIG waste of money!,I agree with the other customers who rated this DVD very low. This DVD is such a big dissapointment to me. My daughter hated it and both my husband and I watched it with her the first time (and the last) and thought that it was completely inappropriate for this age group. It had no educational value and was not fun to watch. I wish I could return it and get my money back on this. I expected more from a Disney product.
1,A Big Disappointment,"My daughter, age 2 1/2, is really into the princesses. I bought the first DVD and she really enjoyed it, so we added Beauty shines from within, thinking that it would be a very empowering, positive message type of stories. Wow, Disney really missed a great opportunity. This DVD was just ridiculous and a little scary. I was pretty angry when we watched it. What a complete waste of $20. I definitely wouldn't recommend it. It has ""disappeared"" from my daughter's movie drawer into the trash, where it belongs."
4,"Cheezy, but she LOVES it...","My three-year old is a devoted princess fan, and we got this for her so that she could watch a princess movie without spending an hour and a half in front of the TV. Both the Ariel and Jasmine sections are from the Saturday morning TV shows, and Cinderella is a retelling of her own story. Yes, *I* think it's boring and low-budget, but my daughter loves it and that's what matters. Plus, since each section is only 20-minutes or so long, she doesn't spend as much time in front of the TV.As for it being too scary, I don't think there's anything scarier in these stories than in the original disney movies. Jafar turns into a snake, Maleficent turns into a seriously scary dragon (not to mention those goblins), Ursula grows to enourmous size then gets stabbed in the stomach....if your kid isn't scared by those things, I doubt they'll be scared by this."
2,Midori Needs to Live With It,"Her lack of experience, both musically and in life, shows in this recording. It lacks individuality and drama and the essential edges that Bartok requires. If you want a more moderate approach to the Bartok 2, try the recent Shaham with Boulez. But Mutter is still my favorite."
3,Good old David Attenborough...,"I sometimes get the idea that David Attenborough went out one year and shot 100,000 hours of nature footage, and has been creating documentaries out of it ever since. This book on the different orders of mammals, though it does not include obvious retreads like some of his earlier films and books, follows the same admittedly pleasing structure: primitive to advanced. That is, we open with monotremes and marsupials, proceed ""upward"" through insectivores, rodents, and so on up to homo sapiens. Each species gets a fine color photo and one or two gee-whiz details about its appearance or habits. A typically rewarding coffee-table nature book from everyone's favorite British naturalist."
4,Video Playdate,I have 2 1/2 year old twin girls and it's hard to finda video that they can agree on. They love watching Kristenand learn something from everything she does.We watch this video together everyday!
2,Shameful!,"It's hard to believe that a country lost 1/4 of its people over nothing. This work felt more like something on PBS than A&E. Usually, A&E Biographies are bright, light-hearted, and chatty. This one kept it somber based on the seriousness of the subject. The work doesn't make this connection, but I immediately thought of Jim Jones, Stalin, and many other self-destructive and genocidal leaders. The work doesn't mention the United Nations until the very end. I kept asking myself why didn't the UN do more. This disc also goes from discussing Pol Pot in the 1970s then jumps to the 1990s. Why make that leap? Why was nothing done in the 1980s? Much is mentioned of Vietnamese refugees and immigrants in the US. Why don't people talk about those in the Cambodian diaspora more if they faced such a tragedy? It's not that this is a bad documentary, it's that the subject is so tragic and frustrating. I hope nothing like this and on this scale happens during this new century."
5,Friedrich Willhelm Nietzsche,"Nietzsche was born in 1844 and died in 1900, long before Marilyn Manson, Trent Reznor, or anyone from Rammstein was ever even thought of..."
2,What was that all about?,"Pointless, nearly plotless drama of young Moroccan man's interaction with sour old Frenchman. The film moves at a glacial pace, with rambling dialogue, but little if anything happening. The performances are so subdued that the characters never become anything but vague shadows. The music is good, the photography outstanding, but that's about it."
2,I will never buy any thing from toshiba,"I have one of the satellite models. The screen kept turning black soon after 1 year warranty. I called their technical support and they diagnosed it was a back light problem. I have to find a place myself to fix it. A friend of mine also has a satellite model.The floppy driver broke one week after purchasing. I am buying a new one, certainly not toshiba. And I will never buy anything from toshiba."
5,curosity,"hi..i'm halil...now i am writing about toshiba satellite 5205-s505 notebook. you have already determined the price of this notebook about 1,699.99 dollars. now i wonder, is this price include a tax?. if not, what about tax?. than i live in turkey..so how can i get this notebook..if i come to usa, can i get this notebook more cheap? give me some information please..:) already now, thanks for all helps..."
4,Very entertaining,"""The King of Cards"" is one of those books that takes you back to a place where you wish you could have grown up and had friends like the characters in the book.You get to know the characters. You cheer for them, laugh and cry with them, and even get angry at them. These characters are college kids who are out to make a fortune by printing id cards for colleges. Ther run into the problems of not having the funds for proper tools to make the id's. None of them know how to run a business, or have the proper experience in printing and marketing.What I like about Mr. Ward's book is that one minute things are going great for the kids. Another, they run into all sorts of trouble such as machine malfuctioning, run-ins with the law and having to deal with parents that are more like chidren than adults.If you want to read a book that is ful of adventure, read ""The King of Cards""."
4,A clever bit of fiction,"Robert Ward's The King of Cards is, for the most part, witty and charming in ways that few other modern books are. While Ward's attempt at a emotional ending backfires, and the main character's wordy ramblings on the events that shaped his persona are unimpressive, the book is consistantly funny and the characters are well drawn. This book is a nice bit of light humor."
5,Gems within are worth it!,"Even if Chet Baker has a few downs throughout, both Stan and Chet bring together a wonderful mix. Getz's opening solo on the first track is, by far, his BEST ever! This CD is worth that track. Again - his BEST solo ever. Listen to it over and over - you'll agree that's it's flawless and moving!"
3,"At moments wonderful, at others, unlistenable","My two favorite jazz musicians are Chet Baker and Stan Getz. They played their music with such style and coolness that really sets quite an atmosphere.This CD is one of those albums that satisfies and disapoints at the same time. Getz's solo opening on ""I'm Old Fashioned"" is probably one of his best latter day solos. Baker's voice is really shaky and the fact that he attempts to Mel Torme (Skat sing) his way through some of the songs when he should of been playing the trumpet is quite annoying.He does manage some good trumpet work though throughout the CD. Getz really does a good job with his solos but Baker, sadly, doesn't shine so well on the album.For some really good performances with these two in their prime get the ""Stan Meets Chet"" album or ""West Coast Live"". This album is just for the big fans of the two musicians."
3,"Quintessence , Volume 1 (Live)","Although I've never listened to Baker much I found him fun to listen to on this recording. Sure his voice is strained but he scat sings surprisingly well on But Not For Me and on Just Friends. On both tunes you can really hear the mind behind the trumpet. Mraz, who is usually a fantastic bassist, rushes in several spots but Jim McNeely plays great piano on this recording (what ever happened to him?).Considering the overall shape both men were in during the 80's this isn't a bad CD to sit back and listen to. Two old war horses playing comfortable tunes with a very good rhythm section."
2,intoxicated Chet Baker ruins CD,Painfully Painfully off-key. like fingernails on a chalkboard. FLAT. Baker's singing isn't even close to on-key.Chet Baker is too intoxicated to sing on-key. The cover picture will show that Stan is either bored or VERY angry and having to be on stage with this doper.When Baker plays and stops singing the music really improves...Getz is wonderful throughout
2,Want the SW trilogy? Get the one on Varese Sarabande!!,"I already owned another ""Star Wars Trilogy"" on ""Varese Sarabande"" recording label. I have to say that this version (on ""Sony"" music label) is not as good as the Varese one. The Sony recording is boomy and somewhat loose. The Varese is very tight and with better sound all around. The orchestra on the Varese is the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Varujan Kojian and their performace beats the one on this CD. Yes! Even if this one is conducted by Mr.Williams himself. Trust me. I've been listening to classical music since I was a child and I can tell a good performance from a not-so-good one. For instance the timpani (the big noisy drum) in ""The Asteroid Field"" goes pratically unnoticed on the ""Sony"" recording; on the ""Varese"" you can hear those timpany loud and clear! The tempo on the ""Varese"" recording is not loose as it is on the Sony recording. Do yourself a favour and don't get this recording; get the ""Varese Sarabande"" one, instead."
5,Star Wars -- 'Nuff Said,"All I can say about this score is that it truely is Star Wars. The music in the original Star Wars Trilogy I believe is by far John Williams's greatest masterpiece. The music in this CD was performed at Skywalker Ranch by some of the greatest musicians in California. I have all three of the Special Edition 2cd albums, which contain practically all the music in the movies, but this cd is so powerful and moving that I still enjoy playing it occasionally for the slight differences in playing style. I especially love the extra long finale at the end. Only on this cd have I heard an extended version of the Throne Room/Finale. Other great themes include Leia's theme, Luke&Leia's theme, Yoda's Theme, and my all time favorite--The Imperial March! The cd is digitally mastered for superior sound and doesn't have a single crackle on the whole thing. If you are a Star Wars fanatic like me, buy this cd. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great CD,"We used the CD for a ""Star Wars"" birthday party. As guests walked up to the door we had it playing to set the mood. Then when we went to the ""Cantina"" we had the music from the bar scene playing. The musical light saber game we played was done to the triumpant end song. The music played a great part in making the party fun!"
4,"Concise, helpful hints on many subjects",This book contains many useful suggestions and hints on solving everyday problems commonly associated with things 'Dads' usually fix. I first got this book when I went to college and still pick it up from time to time. A handy tool to have around.
5,A must read for young and older.,The writing is rich and deep yet very simple to read and digest. I wish I would have read this years ago. There are gems on every page and I cant wait to get back into the book. I will be buying this book for both my kids and their spouses and using what I learn in my mentoring.
2,Good songs badly recorded,"Perhaps my system/ears/brain are too much hi-fi, but it is clear to this old man with diminished hearing that the melody-carrying single instruments are often projected at the listener too loudly when they do their thing. Can actually hear the shouty wind reeds buzzing at the level of all 30 accompanying instruments (no, not a bagpipe drone!) Upper bass is mixed too much forward and there is so much cumulating distortion that I donated this to the Salvation Army (keeping the rest of conductor I have loved in person Lockhart's work.) Still waiting for proper treatment of this fine body of music outside movie soundtracks themselves. Hollywood composers/recording engineers know to keep orchestra spacing in at least 3 of the 4 playback dimensions. (Here, the timing and/or pitch veer off occasionally--the 4th dimension does not hold.)"
2,Overall pretty unremarkable,"The only thing missing from this album is some music from Titanic. Perhaps they couldn't get or afford the rights. Otherwise it has every Celtic cliché of the late 20th century. Anyway, if you have to have a Celtic album in your collection, this is as good as any other. At least it has Scotland The Brave. The addition of classical music distinguishes the album, but its kind of like, ""here's the Celtic part, and then here's the Classical part."""
4,Serves its purpose,"The book is not extremely interesting but serves its purpose. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you're very interested in the history of psychology, mainly because I think the topic is dry; the book is fairly well written, however. It would have been better if it had included a section on the impact of Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis, and Don Meichenbaum on the practice of psychotherapy.Lee J. Markowitz, Department of Psychology, University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada)"
2,Very dry,"This book is so dry. It just rambles on and on. I prefer books that get to the point! It doesn't really get into how people contributed to psychology. It describes their lives in detail, such as where they lived, what their parents did, whom they married, how they died. I liked the hypnosis chapter, but only because I found the topic itself to be interesting."
2,Check Local Stores for best pricing,Found these at Loew's and Walmart for way cheaper. The chain did not hold up with the weight of the suet.
5,GREAT!,"Fast shipping, a great family movie..but a little cheesy at times. came like brand new and only 1 cent!"
5,"Excellent science fiction, fantasy, horror from ""beyond""","I haven't seen an author bite off this much in one piece in quite awhile and pull it off and I read Lots of this Stuff! I enjoyed the various tours and histories of his universe as well as the wonderful detail that so descriptively brought it all to life. Mr. Hamilton is really good at jumping all over time and space without losing us readers and keeping up interest in his seemingly staggering number of principal characters and plot twists. Since reading Emergence & Expansion I have found myself speculating on just WHAT Mr. Hamilton is going to do next with WHO and HOW it will all pull together as I'm sure it will. I like the fact that I can't second guess where he's ultimately going with The Reality Dysfunction so, you see, I must buy the next book! Smart, Mr. Hamilton........"
4,"Lives up to the promise of ""Emergence""","After reading the first book in this series ""Reality Dysfunction: Emergence"", I was hooked, and immediately bought the second installment.It has lived up to the promise of the first book, and comes to a nail biting and edge of seat conclusion. Hamilton continues to develop the universe he has created, giving us a glimple into the Tyrathca society and suggesting that they have direct knowledge of the catastrophe that caused the collapse of Laymil civilization.The stars of this book are the mechanically enhanced troops that are set down on Lalonde, both the hi-tech body enhancements and their Esprit de Corps and devil may care attitude to life, death and danger.Needless to say I have purchased the next installment of the series, which amounts to six books in total, if you don't count short stories and add ons.A great universe full of interesting characters, clever twists and unforseen developments. Brilliant stuff."
5,"On par with Dune, Foundation series","Read it Fridays and Saturdays only. It is one of those books that you keep reading deep into the night, so you can sleep in the next day. By the way, the next book in the series (Emergence) is not quite as good, but I am still waiting for the third in the series to be delivered in (I think) 1998."
1,It's Not Worth It,Volume 2 of a six volume series. See series review on the Reality Dysfunction:Emergence page.
3,"Good story, but isn't concluded so well.","The Reality Dysfunction has a very good storyline, if sometimes a bit unlogical. The author is mostly carried away by his own vivid imagination, and falls short of writing a coherent story. A book this long (1228 pages) really only gets you going by making you wish to know how it all ends, and at the end of this book you're left with a LOT of loose ends."
3,not bad but not great either,"i think the story was interesting ... its just that the ending was a huge letdown. Its building up to something huge, and nothing huge or interesting happens at all. At first i thought this was a 3 part series. Then i realized it was just a very lame ending. Seemed like maybe he got bored with writing it and just wanted to end it. Either that or there will be another set of books that continues this.There were MANY areas of the story left un-explored. I'm hoping his other books fill them in, otherwise this 2 book series was a let down."
4,More Space Opera,"A continuation of the first book, again none of the stories end with any kind of conclusion. I guess I have to buy the next one. Damn it!!! I hate soap operas."
3,"Good, but lacked focus","Reality Dysfunction: Expansion continued the great characters and spectacular universe of Emergence, but it lacked focus. The story was disjointed, and even comical in places (the dead Irish guy with his ridiculous speech). Thankfully, the 'sequel series' Neutronium Alchemist returns to greatness like Emergence."
5,EXCELLENT - Brand new concepts about weaponry,"This is one of those books that come along once in a while and really makes your imagination take flight in all aspects, shattering current paradigms. I specially liked the weaponry, bio-enhacements, med-tech concepts. They sound like something worth looking into in the next century..."
4,"The saga continues...and once again, does not disappoint.","Mr. Hamilton flawlessly picks up the complex tapestry he began with the first book. We continue to get intriguing glimpses of the characters within the characters and begin to see just a glimmer of their possible places in the unfolding drama. In this second book, we begin seeing what pieces are on the board and potentially where they might begin to fit in the inevitable ""final battle."" Once again, woven into the basic characterization and the more subtle characterization in the novel, Hamilton continues to offer glimpses into the politics, economics, science, and the ""great unknown"" of the universe he has built, allowing us to both appreciate the intricacy of the developement and to formulate our own theories regarding his reality. The depth of this novel does not disappoint and I eagerly await discovering that the next book is available."
2,"promising ideas, too long and little payoff","I liked part 1 more than part 2. It's too long, though. I'd say this book could be one third the size and be 10x more enjoyable. There are just too many very, very long descriptions of situations, people, places and items which are just plain boring. I found myself skipping over these long interludes.Also, I was disappointed in the end. Not because it didn't wrap everything up in a tidy little bundle, but because the thread he chose to resolve was the least interesting, in my opinion. There were lots of other threads that were completely unexplored. Perhaps the rest of them will be tied up or discussed more in future novels? I won't be reading them."
5,Innovative...Beautiful...Spellbounding,"I can not attempt to begin writting about this album. It is reminds me of what I forgot music could accomplish... ""Show Me the World"" is breath taking. I simply love this album, it combines standards with rare matterial, and frankly I can't say enough. Mandy and Bernadette Peters together on a few tracks- who could ask for anything more? The orchestations(sp) are mystical and magical, and...and... what can I say? You like Mandy? You love this album. The music can be soft and gentle and emtional, or fast paced and occsionaly silly. If you like muscials, I mean really *good* musicals, and appreciate talent, buy this album. If you do not like it, I will be surprised. Truely."
5,So Lively,Can't say enough abou Mandy Patinkin and his singing. He does such a good job and this is another excellent CD to add to your collection.
3,Another side of Patinkin,I have several CDs of Patinkin and this one is ok but not at the top of my list as I was expecting more of him.
2,"""Evening Primrose"" slaughtered","I bought this for the complete ""Evening Primrose"" sequence, and boy, was that a mistake. The main problem, I think, is that these four songs were recorded here without composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim's supervision, and that makes all the difference in the world. Left to his own devices, Mandy Patimkin greatly distorts ""If You Can Find Me""'s melody; Bernadette Peters's voice is under the accompaniment on ""I Remember"" (although she's faithful to the song at least, unlike Patimkin and his arrangers), and the arrangements on ""Dress Casual"" are over-elaborate, gooey, and unrestrained. Neither singer effectively plays his character.I didn't care for the other stuff either, but that's your own lookout. Just don't do as I did; don't buy this for ""Evening Primrose"". Buy instead the ""Evening Primrose"" that comes with ""Frogs"".By the way, WHY is amazon.com listing this under ""classical music""? It's about as far from classical as you can get."
4,Ther are sections of this that just sing,"This guy is really talented. The book ebbs and flows---some parts better than others, some sub plots better than others. But if you take the kind of distance from the plot that one needs for a Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett ---you'll find that you've found a true heir to the masters of the genre.Am going to see what else this guy wrote. He's very good."
2,Hard to read,"I had read another Peter Temple book which I liked very much, but this one was very hard to read. He is Australian, and uses Australian ""lingo"" which I found difficult to interpret at times. I was just disappointed because of that, and have abandoned reading it for now. I will probably go back and give it another try soon."
4,Gritty Australian mystery,"Peter Temple's mysteries are crisp and gritty. There's no fluff or nonsense. You have to pay close attention to the plot, but he's like an Australian Michael Connelly -- you get to know the world he describes very well."
4,"A hang on to your hat thriller, Aussie style","Half way through this book I was beginning to wonder why there was all the fuss about Peter Temple. Yes, the man can write well and the Australian setting is interesting, but for the rest Bad Debts came across as a reasonable copy of your standard hard-boiled crime noir story, replete with clever one liners, seedy settings and the obligatory femme fatale. But then Temple steps up a gear or three and there is no stopping the action, tension and pace. You have to pay attention as the plot races through twists and turns faster than a getaway car, but it is an exciting ride and a great read. There is enough here to add Peter Temple's name to your list of ""must try"" crime writers."
4,Welcome addition to the genre,"There is unfortunately so little that we know about crime writing in Australia. After Peter Temple won the Gold Dagger, it opened the door to his books even in the self-centered USA.""Bad Debts"" is an original take on PI novels. It has the neccessery grittiness and sharp, dark humor, but succeeds to escape all the tired and lame cliches of this genre. Trying to figure out the numerous quirks of the Aussie dialect just adds to the whole fun.The plot is as realistic and dirty as coruption and abuse of power can possibly be. More, please..."
5,Finally...............,"Originally released (I believe) in 1992, this CD has been out of print since the fall of the Collins Classics Label. It is the most precise, most exciting, and most musical of the Walton string quartet recordings (not to mention taking things up to metronome marking). There is no reason one interested in these quartets should not buy this CD. The acoustics are great, and the playing of the Britten Quartet cuts like a laser. Definitely one to add to a quartet collection without the price burden and disappointment of newer recordings."
5,"A Great, Interesting Book",I have used this book for my term paper and would say that sometimes I got off track because the book was so interesting.Dalton has a witty and funny writing style and I feel as if I am reading a thriller.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
2,Go elsewhere for TR,"This is unfortunately not a very good biography. It was written, one supposes, to give a ""woman's perspective"" on TR, but gives that genre -- if it's a genre -- a bad name. World War One is given the same weight as the arrival of pet squirrels and children's coughs. We get a slab of family life and then a slab of contemporary politics, and then a slab of family life and so on throughout the book. There is no historical perspective or synthesis that might move the reader to a greater, more thoughtful, height. The only reason I give it two stars is that there is a great deal of fact in the book, and it isn't poorly written. But go somewhere else for a bio."
1,Flawed Biography,Ms. Dalton's biography of Teddy Rooevelt is flawed in one major way.She has only a very cliche understanding of the free market system that while not perfect is the best way to ensure the highest standard of living for all Americans. She writes about Andrew Carnegie as a selfish accumulator of wealth derived from the exploitation of steel workers. Never mind that Mr. Carnegie was a Scottish immigrent whose father was a weaver and came to America looking for opportunity for his family while TR was born to wealth and privilege. Carnegie starting as a clerk for a railroad co. took great risks of his own capital to build the steel industry one of the most important building blocks of prosperity and ultimatly returned his great wealth to society. While Roosevelt did help enact some needed regulations concerning monopoly and labor I found Ms. Dalton to write from an anti capitalist point of view that totally misjudges the contribution of the early industrialists.
5,An inspiratioal biography,"Like David McCulough's John Adams this book combines with political history an engaging personal story, especially a story of a man's growth and the way his marriage helped him mature. In fact, the combination makes the book more interesting than pure political biography does. Dalton knows her history and yet weaves it into the story with a light touch. Her understanding of TR's family life goes deeper than anything Edmund Morris has writen and she also tells us what TR's peers thought about him. This is one of the most unusual biographies I have read because it qualifies as a page turner and a standard classic history. Don't miss it!"
1,Lasted less then 30 min,This bit failed to fulfill even my initial low expectations. Knew it is a cheap bit thus would not last long and needed it only for one task. Bearing fell off in less than 30 min while I was still setting up the cuts.
5,The Best Book I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!,"Thus book is about a girl who is visiting her great- aunt Wealthy in ohio, when a young man sent by her uncle Arthur is trying to win her and her money. Of course she falls for him and then her father finds evidence that he is a drinker and a gambler. Elsie has a hard time believiong this, adn a hard time trying to get over this young man.. I would recomend this book to GIRLS who are looking for a great love story.(this isn't only love between guys and girls but also between family.) if anyone wants to here more about this book or books in this seriesa email me at :jessbess123456."
4,An Inconvenient Truth,"I grew up with Steve Courson, player Little League against him, and knew him both before and after he attended the University of South Carolina. When he came home, after a year at college, he was significantly larger and more heavily muscled than he had been in high school. In 1975, all of us ""knew"" merely by looking at him that he was using steroids.Any notion that somehow neither the college or the Steelers knew about the steroid use is a joke, Rest in peace, Steve."
5,GREATest hits!,"This cd only has three problems with it, it does not have: only the good die young, just a fantasy, and and so it goes. Other than that, this collection is the one to own. It condenses Vol. 1 and 2 and Vol. 3 on to one CD, and saves you the money of buying all three to get the hits on this one collection. So, go out and buy it!"
3,Great performances/Redundant Repertoire,"Andrew Manze is a wonderful violinist, and his costars-- Richard Egarr and Jaap ter Linden-- are also excellent performers. I have no complaint whatsoever as to the performance of the eight violin sonatas on this disk. If one is seeking a good recording of these works, look no further. However, if one is looking for an interesting album of early music for pure listening enjoyment, please take caution. Jean-Féry Rebel's sonatas suffer from sameness and, in end, listening to the disk one feels that one have heard it all after the third sonata. Please understand, the music is lovely, so I would not go so far as to say that the album failed, but it is disappointing if one is looking for a more varied introduction to the music of Rebel or the time period in general. I was disappointed that even with near-perfect performances, nothing really stood out on the CD."
5,Sam's Sister is an excellent book about adoption,A great children's book for use with any children who are touched by adoption especially a young child a birthparent is already parenting. I bought a copy for our birthmother and kept one to read to our son to help him understand his birthfamily's feelings.
2,poor display of hebrew text,"This book is very difficult to read in the Kindle application. The english font can be enlarged, but the hebrew cannot be enlarged since it is in a image file. This makes it very difficult to see without a magnifying glass. I would not buy this book for the kindle."
4,"Good Material, Bad Discs","The material and exercises in this book are very helpful in teaching unpointed Hebrew. There are plenty of exercises for practice and the main plus is an answer key in the back of the book! There are so many language products out here that don't put the answers in the book but force you to go online to check your work. I took one star away because I, like many others received CDs that didn't work. One of my discs would only download about 15 of the tracks and the other disc didn't work at all. The good news for me is that the Hebrew words have English transliterations which means I can still use the book. As a matter of fact you can buy the book without the CDs and I recommend that purchase instead of taking a chance with the poor quality control of the CDs. I would have taken another star away but the material will really have you reading and speaking modern hebrew. An inexpensive English to Hebrew dictionary is another good idea to help in your language learning."
1,Unreadable CD,"When the package arrived, I opened it up to discover two CDs in a standard ""Double CD"" crystal case, but both of the CDs were COMPLETELY UNREADABLE, not from any obvious defect like damage related to shipping, but much more likely because they weren't even formatted to start with.So far as I can tell, both of the CDs are completely blank, and have no tracks on them at all.On one side there is a label, and on the other side a nice shiny surface. So at least they had the courage to put their name on the CDs.But there simply isn't any data on either of them.Very disappointing."
3,Vintage Guitar magazine review:,"Call this disc a tribute to the city where the blues reign. Bluesman Paul deLay had recorded all nine of his previous albums back home in Portland, Oregon. For this new CD, he made a pilgrimage to lay down a session with a specially formed Chicago band and invited Chicago guitarslinger Jimmy Dawkins and vocalist Zora Young to help out. The result is a rollicking set of blues originals from DeLay, well-known for his self-penned lyrics and compositions. Dawkins' guitarwork is tough stuff on his two cuts, and band member Rockin' Johnny Burgin tracks some solid licks on the remaining tunes. Zora Young sizzles on her sole song. Despite the guest stars, deLay still holds center stage. He sings his heart out and blows his diatonic and chromatic harmonicas as if his life depended on it. As deLay comments in the production notes in the liner booklet, ""Technical, schmechnical---put some heart in it, dammit!"""
2,deLay Does Chicago,"Save your money on this dud. DeLay is a great lyricist, vocalist, and harp player but his talents are wasted ""getting back to his roots"". He is much too improvisational to perform this tripe. More jazz than blues and loving it."
3,Beware of the length,"I can't comment on the quality, as I never used the product. A savvy electrical engineer friend showed me that I didn't need such a heavy wire to get good quality sound, as my speakers are each only about 11 feet from my stereo. So he put in a 24 gauge wire and it works fine. I'm keeping the 12-gauge for possible future use.Before that, I did however, measure out the entire roll to cut the proper length I needed. The ""50-feet 12 gauge speaker wire"" turned out to be 45 feet and 2 inches. If you need 50 feet exactly you may have a problem. (I purchased it on 03/09/10).Amazon provided great service as usual, and delivered ahead of promised time."
1,"Not 12 gauge, may not be all copper","It's 14 gauge, definitely not 12 gauge. I based this on visually comparing it to known 14 and 12 gauge wire, after stripping. Also, one of the pair is silver color, not copper color. It could be tinned copper, or aluminum."
1,Product it misrepresented - DO NOT BUY without reading reviews,"This product is grossly misrepresented. It is not 12 gauge, and is not oxygen-free copper (it is aluminum with one side copper clad). This was reported by a reviewer a year ago, and is still being sold by this vendor as something it is not.Please read reviews before buying, especially the review from KnuKonceptz, to avoid problems and expense of returning."
4,true 12 guage wire / not a full 50ft,"In my mind, as long as the guage is accurate, speaker wire is speaker wire. The Raptor S12 delivered the proper guage but looked to be about 46ft. In my mind this wasn't a huge issue as most reviews said it may come up short."
5,Nice speaker wire for audiophiles,"I have not measured this wire, so I cannot comment on the length. I purchased because I need to connect speakers to the in wall wire I have. This is high quality wire and for a great price. You cannot find 12 AWG at the home improvement centers and if you do, it is generally twice the price."
1,"Don't buy this, it is only 45 feet","It say 50 feet, but I measure it is only 45 feet. So the manufacturer made a 10% extra profit on you. I don't like to buy item that do not match the what it is labeled. The wire and the insulation layer is cheap too. You can be much better speaker wire somewhere else."
4,METRA Ltd S12-50 12 Gauge Clear Speaker Wire,The 12 guage wire was the correct wire guage for our Home Stereo / HD systems. The wire jacket is for in wall runs. I expect to get many years of performance and enjoyment running our 5.1 system with this cable.Amazon's price was very good; and shipment was fast!
3,Wire okay but length is 45',"The Raptor 12 gauge wire seems fine but, as other commenters have noted, the length is 45 feet, not 50 feet."
1,Too short,I ordered 50 feet of cable for two speakers in a 10 X 12 room and did not have enough cable! RIP OFF maybe you should BUY AMERICAN at least we know how long 50 FEET is!
3,Raptor S12-50 50-Feet 12 Gauge Speaker Wire (Clear),I am one of your satisfied customer; that is why I have repeated this order again
4,Awesome Speaker Wire!,"I purchased this for my two 12"" kicker cvrs and it is a whole bunch of TRUE 12ga speaker wire! Yeah, who cares if its only 44', who the heck even needs 50' of speaker wire. Anywho, great buy, great wire, high quality, would buy again."
3,Worth reading,"Not a bad book. Points out some glaring inconsistencies in the writings and arguments of some popular fundamentalist/inerrantist apologists and Bible teachers like Gleason Archer and Hal Lindsey. All it takes is ONE provable inconsistency or inaccuracy in the Scriptural text to require a modification or abdication of the Inerrancy doctrine, and Callahan provides several which fundamentalists/inerrantists would have a hard time explaining or explaining away. Often they DON'T explain them ... they just avoid them - see, e.g., ""Anonymous"" one-star reviewer ""Hugh Raspberry!,"" who is apparently J.P. Holding, whose Web site at tektonics.org (no URLs in reviews) contains a lengthier review of the book, with much of the same language. Holding's reviews and comments about books and persons critical of inerrancy and fundamentalism can politely be described as ""caustic"" and ""sarcastic,"" so be prepared to be sniped at if you take exception to what he writes."
4,Important addition to secular biblical scholorship,"If Callahan's work needs any vindication outside of itself, the sheer disgust it inspires in blatant fundie apologists provides it. Aside from acting as an efficient debunking machine, the book is strong in basic biblical history. Downside: some of his points are not very clear. Sometimes arguments are lost in trying to import and summarize other complex fields of study. Not for beach reading. Perks: Great reference for biblical debates."
1,Very boring read,"I purchased this book expecting it to be an enjoyable read and see how unbelievable the christian beliefs are, just to amuse myself. What I got was a book written by a layman not for laymans, inside were page after page of tedious, painstaking presentations of the history of Israel, detailed analysis of the social conditions etc. that fit more for a student of bible criticism. Actually background info. about the prophecies are necessary and required, but to present it in such a tediously detailed manner only kills the interests of the average reader. This book is boring and is not for someone who wants an enjoyable read on a Sunday afternoon."
1,Not as good as European Anthology,"Due to legal matters, this double is both shorter and less authoritative than the European Anthology compilation (it includes no Kinks-era recordings from 1966-70). Being as how little of Dave's output outside of this classic time-frame is really up to much (""Imagination's Real"" and ""Living On A Thin Line"" apart - and these both feature on the Anthology) I can't really recommend this for anyone apart from the kompletists."
4,Justification,This is a necessary read for anyone working with the concept of Justification. He comes to no conclusion at the end as a good historian should. I must admit that it is not an easy read even though he writes well. The material is the problem for those who have written in the past on this question have not always been clear. It is one of the books I felt I needed to read and i was right.
1,Disappointed in Quality,Items are in concept very useful but of poor quality. The belt clip broke after a few weeks.
5,Sweet!!!!!!!!,This rocks!!!!!!!!!!!! It has each game cd. It is not just one cd with all of them.In mine halo 1 was the platinum hits version and halo 2 and the map pack are regular.I play this on my xbox 360(yes I have one) and it runs great on xbox live and story mode. If you dont have any halo games get this!!!!
1,Just another Halo Players Reveiw,"Well, so Halo is an awesome game (1,2) Its online play rocks.I suggest you get both, if you just get Halo 2 you'll be Going WTF Whats going on?its a very cool story line,The main chaecters the Master Cheif, hes a cyborg,Then theres the flood,The Covanentand thats it,The game play rocks, great grapix (2 is better)But i gotta say halo 2 is better then 1!Peace out!"
1,Hmmmm,Awful book. Lack of plot. Too much whippings. Can a person really get excited at the image of a guy in a corset?
1,Where's the argument?,"Professor Mills simply provides a laundry list of claims he happens to regard as mean-spirited and asks us to assess them likewise. I hope this is not what has come to be acceptable in social ""science."" I thought science involves the presentation and interpretation of evidence in order to rationally defend a thesis. Or am I missing something here?Joel Warren Lidz, Ph.D. Department of Philosophy Bentley College Waltham, MA 02154 jlidz@bentley.edu"
1,Older Bible Material for Ladies,"Although this material was relevant in its day, it is a little outdated for my purposes.Thank you for sending it to me. I enjoyed reviewing it."
4,help me out plz,himy friend is offering me this very laptop for $450/-. his is under a year old and in good shape. do u think this is a not-to-be-lost offer or can i get a better deal elsewhere with the same one or a new one of similar configuration? mail meramtanuj at yhoo dot commthx.
3,Err,"I ordered this drive and recieved the GDR 8162B instead of the GDR 8164B. I guess it is not a big deal because it still did what it said it was going to do, but I still think you should get what your promised. Other than that, the GDR 8162B has not failed me yet!"
4,Great starter CD for the new Celtic listener.,"There is a lot of traditional celtic music complied on this CD, with Lorrenna Mckennet as the most noteable performer.Also try CD's by Clannad, Enya and Michelle Tumes for great sounds which are regionally tied to this compliation."
2,Disappointing...,"This video is definetly not worth the money. I'm in good shape, but the moves were very quick and hard to learn. I watched the tapes segments 3-4 times each just to learn the moves. Even at 5 months, the quick adjustments to the moves (without warning) caused me to trip over my own feet often! I gave it up within a month, and started something else..."
2,You'll live without this one added to your pregnancy workout,"I wasn't that impressed with the aerobics in this video. When starting a new aerobics routine, I like for the instructor to tell me exactly when to move (which the instructor fails to do several times). The instructor seems friendly, but I feel sort of left out I have guess what the next move will be quite a few times. I hate that! I'm already so clumsy and scatterbrained enough as it is.Also, the exercise band is ANNOYING! It makes your hands smell like rubber and is not that easy to use.Kathy Smith and Buns of Steel 8 are my favorites by far."
2,positive prenatal fitness,"I must say I was dissappointed within the first 10 seconds of this video. The three women in the video look like athletic prototypes, and like they haven't gained one ounce with their prenancy. At 8 months they look like I look at three months. I just couldn't see myself in any of them. I felt the video was hard to follow, and you had to guess what steps were coming next. I couldn't wait for it to end."
4,Great for Moms who love aerobics,"This video is great for moms who have been doing aerobics prior to getting pregnant. It is challenging, with fairly quick moves, but it's interesting and gives a good workout in a short amount of time. It's on par with Kathy Smith and Buns of Steel. The exercise band routines are as challenging as you want them to be (band was included w/ my tape purchase) and were a nice variation to the traditional toning routines in others."
1,Big Disappointment,I bought this video to vary my workouts (I also use the Kathy Smith video.) I found it to be very hard to follow and not much of a workout. The strenthening band is too cumbersome. My only larger disappointment than this video is the fact that I can't return it. I highly recommend the Kathy Smith video over this one.
3,"Good, though does not match up to their debut album","I loved Magna Canta's first release, Enchanted Spirits. I had very high hopes for this one, but the music as a whole seemed less memorable. The Gregorian chant dominates the music, which I love, but the dance beats that accompany it seem somewhat uninspired and mediocre. Nothing about the album seemed new to me. After the first listen, the songs already felt a little too familiar. I was hoping for at least one ""awe-inspiring"" piece, (such as the song ""Fundamentum"" by the similar group Lesiem)but I didn't find it. Still, a good release."
5,a wonderful tea,"I was introduced to this tea in a Russian restaurant in WA while visiting my daughter. It was the perfect tea to compliment a great meal. When I got home, I looked for it and as usual when I go hunting for something, ended up finding it on Amazon. I love this tea. I have a cup of hot tea every night before bed with a Ghiradelli dark chocolate square. I usually use loose leaf teas, but I feel this is a good quality tea that just happens to be in a bag. I gave some to my daughter when she came to visit me. She also remembered the tea we had at the restaurant. It brings back a good memory every time I drink it."
3,Good but not complete secure,"Its a good case, but not a perfect fit with the 504. It is a bit tight in the upper side and the 504 will pop out of the case easily. You have to be careful when opening the case and raising the case lid, as the 504 may fall off. However, it does provide excellent protection to the screen while providing access to the side buttons and headphone jack. I have been looking for a ""off the rack"" case for the 504 and could not find anything adecuate. Due to the 504's size, I had to look in the digital camera section for a better case and even then, the cases where sometimes too small. This may be the best option for the 504. Please note that the 504 will NOT fit in the ARCHOS cases designed for the 404 or 604. The 504 has a bigger battery making it thicker than the other players by half a centimeter. Learned that the hard way (anyone want a 404 case at a bargain price?)"
4,Splendid Avante-garde Syncopation,"Henry Cow taps into a realm of music often over-looked by the masses. In the tradition of more widely accepted artists such as King Crimson and Frank Zappa, Henry Cow blends a wide variety of instruments into a syncopated, wild, wacky experience for the senses. ""Teenbeat"" provides the main theme for the disc. The interplay between the woodwinds and the drums is fascinating. Overall, if you appreciate progressive/avante-garde music that is a little ""off-kilter"", this disc is a must-have."
3,Hold on to your vinyl,"I suppose it's better than the early 90s remix, but this 1999 CD has its own problems. The whole disc sounds like it was mastered from vinyl, and side B is very noisy. Comparing my Virgin LP with this disc, I found that the channels on side B were reversed. And the coda on ""Nirvana for Mice"" ISN'T the original mix. Will this record ever be released properly? Caveat emptor."
2,Too much action,"The show never slows down from beginning to end. Too much cliff-hanging drama in a half-hour show. Music too intense. However, this is safe fare for families desiring an alternative to junk TV."
1,From Back Cover,"Pilot Steve Lockhart thrived on challenges, but now he's in over his head. he'd just achieved his dream of starting up his own charter service, when he'd gone and fallen hopelessly in love with Casey Jansen, the woman of his dreams- and the competition. It looked like they would never get together- until he discovers an abandoned baby girl in his plane...It's the story of Casey's life - she finally finds a manwho can make her curl her toes... and he's the enemy. Steve's glances set her on fire, his teasing makes her go weak. And the sexy-as-sin bachelor's tender care of baby Annie is causing Casey to yearn for a 'happily-ever-after.' But once they find Annie's mother, will Steve take Casey to bed - or put her out of business?From the Bachelors & Babies series"
4,Title track is one of 1994's best,"I only knew about this because I happened to visit Minus ZeroRecords in London at the right time. The song ""Creation"" is agem--a classic big guitar riff as good as any from Paranoid orLed Zeppelin II."
5,steamroller,"really good seventies hard rock,great guitar work and superb singer!i really love these guys. this is good collectors stuff!check it out!!"
4,football belt,"My husband has been looking for this ""simple"" belt for years! Had I know it was called ""Football Belt"" I would have ordered him some a long time ago. He is so happy to have them now! He works on cars every day and cannot stand having a belt that has a big buckle on the front. When he is cleaning a car, if he leans on the car for any reason, any belt with a good size buckle can possibly scratch the car, causing more work for him."
3,"Good, but may overload your circuits!","Cryptonomicon is a very terse, technical, challenging, mind consuming novel. If the length doesn't frighten you away, the details may. Full of techno-talk, crossing generations, and incredible attention to precision, it was a little tiring at times. There was a lot to keep track of and I felt that perhaps the two generations could have been split into two different novels to fully explore each set of protagonists and give them their own forums. However, Stephenson definitely has something here and it's definitely fascinating and captivating. Be sure to leave plenty of open time in you schedule for this one!"
4,"Solid writing, almost always interesting, funny","Good plot, writing and characters. Terribly funny (one of the best I've read in awhile). A bit contrived at points."
5,Intriguing Read,"This is a fascinating read. Well researched, and the characters are very human. I made the mistake of starting this book when I was pregnant. Once into the book I realized that it was not the funny, light hearted (albeit stimulating) book that ""Snow Crash"" was. I put the book down thinking that I would read something less 'head heavy'. After obsessing over what I had read so far, I knew it was a lost cause. I finished the book two weeks before my baby was born. Who knows, maybe he'll be a mathmetician when he grows up!"
5,Magnificent!!!,"Stephenson is simply the best modern writer alive. Each of his books are more engrossing/broad/complex than the last. If you can't tolerate the Capt'n Crunch and Oral Surgery passages, well, then you just don't get it. BTW at first I thought the typos were just lazy editing. But then, after reading the appendix on Solitare, I started to notice some interesting non-randomness in the errors. Has anyone else discovered these clues?"
1,Too many useless words,"This books attempts to entertain through the excessive use of words. Thick with simple witty comments and useless descriptions, this quick read drags on endlessly and finishes with a dull quiet thud.Pass until it comes in paperback."
2,900 pg book filled with very interesting side notes,"I did not like the style of this book. Each chapter did leave me feeling tantalized and somewhat experienced.I thought I was ejnoying myself, as it turns out - I really wasn't. After about 50 pages, I found myself cringing with doubt every other chapter. Is it just a dream sequence - or is it a time jump?Getting to the heart of the story is allot like deciphering a code that you did not agree to look at.If you enjoy that sort of thing, and want to read a 900 pg book filled with very interesting side notes, and the author holds the plot over your head like a bully's game of keep away, then dive in!"
3,So so,"Interesting but could have better continuity and stronger ending. To be fair, i did set it down for long periods. My intellectual son gave it to me so maybe i missed something."
5,Duh.,"It's mother effing good father affairs. Also, when asking oneself about the quality of the novel, refer to the previous."
1,"Great Book, but THIS IS IN GERMAN","This book is sublime. It is fiction in the sense that none of the events depicted actually happened, but it is true in a deeper sense in that something like it almost assuredly did. BUT THIS IS IN GERMAN!!! The irony of reading Cryptonomicon in German is not lost on me, but I would like that to have been clearer. I know it is in the ""Language"" section of the description, but I think something as important as that could have a more descriptive listing. Why would the German language be the first one to come up anyway? Frustrating."
5,"One of the finest novels ever, alongside Pynchon, Eco","I don't know what happened between Snow Crash and this novel, but it must have been not unlike a caterpillar turning into a chrysalis and then a butterfyl. Suffice to say, this novel has made its mark and has becoming a resounding futurist insight into our short-term future in America and around the world. Be sure to read it. And please don't treat it like a sc-fi novel because this is both an historical novel as well as a technological post modern thriller."
3,This book is a long trip. . .,". . . that doesn't go very far. Still, it's thoughtful, with a little action and a lot of surreality. I was glad I read it, and just as glad it was over with. If you like your math difficult and your encryption obtuse, you need this book. For the rest of us, this book is a long, challenging read, so clear a spot on your nightstand -- it'll be there a while."
4,for fiction,"The shipping and handleing was good.The book it self is fiction and I read mostly non fiction. The book was recommended by a friend and he was spot on. I,m still reading and still enjoying this episode of Neals works."
3,great tangents but the main plot slogs along,"This is a fun read IF you focus on Robertson's numerous asides that he sprinkles in everywhere. The actual main story arc of the book isn't all that interesting - certainly not worth the 900 or so pages spent on it. What I liked most about the book are the little, strange tangents that Robertson writes as he tries to talk about his characters. Some of the more scientific forays left me uninterested personally, it was more of the character-specific off-shoots that just sparked a lot of smiles on my part as a reader.Robertson clearly stores a tremendous amount of knowledge on random and trivial things and lets these all come out through the book - I just wish the book's main story was more interesting."
5,Fastest 900 pages I have ever read.,"Okay. First a bit about me... I am a programmer with some interest in computer security, and I have been fascinated by the Enigma and WWII spying in general. I was a math major in college, and I enjoy a lot of technical stuff. I also know a little Japanese so I even caught some of the Japanese puns in this book.So basically, I am the quintessential nerd -- the type of guy who could empty a cocktail party faster than a bomb scare. I'm like Dilbert, only not as good looking. That said, I would still recommend this book to normal people. It has a very good storyline (actually two simultaneous storylines almost 50 years apart), interesting characters, and relationships and details that tie together in fascinating ways.A friend of mine who is an actress (in L.A. even nerds know actresses), said that she thought this book would be a bore but once she got started, was drawn in."
3,Great 3/4s of a book!,"This is such a long book that I'll keep this short: it is a great book for the first quarter, a good book by the time you hit the halfway point, an interesting book at three quarters, and a terrible dissappointment at the end.Mr Stephenson should get a better editor, because at over 900 pages, this is no way to end a book."
2,One book too many,"This is the title that closes the chapter on Stephenson for me. I'd enjoyed Snow Crash enough to overlook the accumulating cuteness that gooed up the end, and I found sufficient merit in Diamond Age to offset the even larger splashes of the same defect marring that volume. Despite its ambitious conception, however, Cryptonomicon is a showcase of sloppy writing and errors of fact. The tone throughout is cleverness so precious it gags. Cute. It's just so preciously cute. Disappointment is compounded when a talented writer mistakes energy for effort."
1,I stopped reading it with about 50 pages left....,Have you ever kept reading a book just because you had already invested so much time into it you feel like you have to? This book starts out just good enough to hook you into a long slow trip to nowhere. He should have cut out the sub-plot of Bobby Shaftoe and sold it as a separate book...it would have actually been good.
3,fair,"Cryptonomicon is well written and enjoyable to read but itsclose to 1200 pages can be exhausting. The ending does notbring all the sub-plots to a close at all. The book just stops.I could just as easily stopped at page 600, 700, or 800 andhave had an equally satisfying ""loose ended"" finish."
4,"Great book, a little too long","This is a great book and was very enjoyable to read, a real page-turner like a good Clancy or King book that you can't put down. However, at around page 500, I just wanted this book to be over. I really wanted to find out how the story ends and find out what happened to the characters, otherwise I probably would have stopped reading the book (which I'm glad I did), but in the middle of the book it seemed more like the quest for the Holy Grail than a book.The details in the book are amazing, Stephenson's sure done his research. Most sci-fi books are lite on true facts, just throwing in mumbo-jumbo to make it sound techie, but this book has the technical details right!"
4,Neal gets it right.,"I read both ""Snow Crash"" and ""The Diamond Age"" and had the same feelings about both: amazingly interesting concepts, good execution for the first 75%, and then a complete and total collapse in the final chapters. With ""Cryptonomicon"", Neal Stephenson finally gets it right. This book is an absorbing read from cover to cover and combines fiction with history and technical details in an extremely entertaining way.Now if only he'd go back and re-write the endings of his other two books..."
4,"Funny, Educational, but leaves many questions open","I enjoyed this book, as the author demonstratd a solid grasp of good sarcasm on many fronts. His research into the parallels of information and deception during WWII and the present global age were put to excellent use.The one character who we should have gotten into the head of more was Ari. He has such a pivotal role in the present time, crafting the (shifting) strategic development of the company. But I feel that he is as aimless as the modern Shaftoe character, even though he is not.I could not give this a 5 star, because the book still left me wanting at the end. I have high hopes for his next venture in this area."
4,Pure Fun,"Looking for enlightenment? Look elsewhere. Looking for fun? You've come to the right place! Well conceived and woven story lines spanning decades realized through engaging characters and incorporating what, for some, may be tedious tech detail but for me was an entertaining, eye opening, mind stretching learning experience. I love the anecdote-within-story approach Stephenson uses throughout the book, e.g., the first few pages of ""Wisdom."" Essentially micro stories standing on their own woven throughout the novel using character and story thread. They're the kind of bits I found hilarious and kept handing to my wife to read which she did somewhat reluctantly at first and then, as did I, became totally engaged. My biggest gripe with most authors is unsatisfactory endings. Ending a novel well is extremely difficult and Stephenson passes my test. Stephenson is clever, cunning and stealthy. Oh yeah, did I mention he writes brilliant prose? More please.P.S. anther aside, it was still a fun book."
2,The characters all seemed the same,A seminal work /that I just couldn't get through /I'm a geek failure
3,Loved the plot but...,"...this writing style is way too wordy.Don't get me wrong. I am a computer geek with a love for hacking, crypto and math.But does he need to tell me about the chemical nutrients in the grass that's eaten by the sheep in the English countryside while (WWII) Waterhouse rides the train to Bletchley Park? Does he need to tell me about all the different ethnic groups in the Phillipines while (present day) Waterhouse goes to check on the Japanese gold on Avi's behalf? I could go on for ever.This droning reminds of my Grandfather, telling me stories that would go on and on and on but never get anywhere.Again, I loved the plot and the ""spy novel"" aspect of his book. But his writing style was a major turn-off for me.I rate this item 3 stars, because of the seemingly daunting effort the creation of this book must have been."
5,It killed all my free time,"It killed all my free time ! (in a good way)The book is filled with real life Historical references and human icons, in a manner that reminded me a little bit of the way ""Forest Gump"" was written, so I'll say that the book is a cross of ""Catch 22"" with an average Tom Clancy, in the pase of a modern Hollywood blockbuster... a REALLY REALLY long one.I loved it.Enjoy."
4,A gripping read,"Having majored in history while working on my undergraduate degree, I found this book to be extremely well-researched. The author obviously went to great pains to make the work believable, and I now have difficulty convincing myself of which characters really did exist and which did not. I thought the modern sections got a little trite (especially the developing relationship between Randy and Amy), but overall I think the book is a great read for someone who has a little extra time on hand."
3,"Wasn't so sure how I'd like the book, ended up being quite good!","It's not a blockbuster in my mind (but maybe I have an unreasonably high expectation for books) but it's quite a good book. It was tedious at times, but overall an enjoyable read. If you like cyber warfare hacking and such futuristic business you'll like this. There's a lot of probable situations in it (it's not *too* far-fetched) and some interesting ideas, like a digital currency (similar to bitcoins). All in all and interesting read - if you're into cyber crime stuff you'll like this book!"
4,"Big book, big vocabulary, big things","This is a really good book which gets into facts you do not normally see, however the book is really large and will take a good portion of time to get through. Also has shifting narrator perspective between three characters, two during World War II and one in the present."
5,cryptastic,"This was the first book I've read by this author. Very impressed. Depth of characters, interlaced plots over two time periods, insightful techno.As a software engineer, and student of maths, I really enjoyed reading about cryptography and fellow coders (wierd huh!)Really recommend it (even if your not a geek you will still enjoy it) !"
3,Save a few trees,"As many other reviewers have noted, this book is very long. Unfortunately it is long because of the author's self indulgent tangents, not because of character and plot development (like Shogun).When the author kept to the topic, the book was interesting and well written. At half the length it would have been a much better book."
3,LONG,"This book was enormously long, and indeed has no plot, albeit the characters are not bad. Naive. The writer uses way too many similes and metaphors, to the point that some passages are hardly readable. The opposite of Hemingway. Given what takes place in the book, it could have been presented in half the volume, if not less, and it would have saved some trees from extinction. Otherwise, interesting ideas, especially if you do not know much about cryptography."
3,Good intro to characters from Baroque Cycle,"Waterhouse, Shaftoe & Comstock are all here in the 20th century.Shaftoe sections are exciting, Waterhouse fairly painful and long long long.Good for long cruises."
1,Wait for Stephenson's next sci-fi -- this one's not it.,"Totally unlike Snow Crash or Diamond Age, this novel lacks any sci-fi imagination and instead is a disjointed journey from WW2 cryptography to modern data warehousing. I finally gave up trying to follow the plot after 400 pages."
3,pretty good,"Pretty good read. But the ending was a total disappointment. This is the only Stephenson I've read but I was really turned off by his apparent obsession with the phallus. I know in some quarters this makes the book ""edgy"", but I found the main characters' inability to think striaght without frequent orgasms juvenile. At times I thought I was reading some lame feminist characterization of men. It was ridiculous."
2,800+ pages of bad road,"While I like Stephenson's earlier work, I don't much care for his latest attempt at literature. With convoluted interlocking plotlines, sketchy charecterization, obscure math jokes, patronizing footnotes, and the most inexplicable sex scene I have ever run across, this doorstop of a novel was not the pleasure I had hoped for. A groundbreaking work in the field of literature intended exclusively for hard-core coders."
3,Asparagus,"Hey, the Cap'n Crunch digression was my favorite part. It reminded me of Proust on asparagus. I also felt that some of the nerdly feelings of the Waterhouses (who kinda merged a bit for me) were beautifully (and originally) expressed. I would quote them, but I failed to dogear and couldn't find them on flipping back through. I enjoyed the long long read and did not skim (I would have edited out the silly Qwghlm stuff though), but I sure do NOT want a sequel. I want something new (again!) and more wiry, dense and crazy, as Snow Crash was."
4,Smartly complex.,"I'm 15% through and am enjoying the complex, yet understandable analyses of conversation, people, and information theory -- Stephenson makes you think."
4,Really enjoyed it; Good/interesting history leasson as well,"Great book. I specially enjoyed learning all about how we broke the German and Japanese codes in WWII. Great history lesson in the process. Exposed me to a new and interesting topic that I had no clue (no pun, :)). Makes me want to read more about WWII.The other parallel story in the book that takes place in modern times is interesting but a little disjointed. Seems like NS changed his mind of where he wanted to take it half-way through it. It goes from being Crypt centric to gold and love story. NS could have milked the Crypt angle a lot more. Interesting idea that could have been better explored.Overall, I think it is definitely worth reading it. You will enjoy it."
3,Convoluted yet fulfilling in a quirky way,"First, lets just say its long, real long. However, the uniqueness of the plot which is both complex and variegated drives the reader along page after page. At times the prose is beautiful and at other times Stephenson's style is cumbersome and unfriendly to the reader. Unfortunately, Stephenson seems to be unable to succinctly convey his thoughts to the reader even with so many words at his disposal. Finally, I must say that the endings is rather an anticlimax. Nevertheless, the novel is fairly enjoyable, mostly due to its refreshingly innovative concepts and would be recommended to those who are interested in computer technology and/or WWII history. If you have the time, that is."
1,"This book is bad! (Sorry, Neil)","First, I must be honest. I only managed to complete 732 pages of the 900+ in this book. (I swear, each night more pages seemed to be added.) I am an avid reader, probably my biggest vice. I even made it all the way through ""The Bell Curve."" However, this is the first book that I have ever stopped reading because it was so badly written, so badly constructed, and had such weak character definition. I kept checking my wine glass for traces of a mind-altering drug, the book was so bad. Please, please don't buy this thing. It stunk, to use the vernacular."
2,has a major problem,"Stephenson has some really good works out there, this isn't one of them. He could have made this book one of his best ever but he went into much to much detail on mathematics/etc to the detriment of the story. For a better Stephenson novel try Snow Crash."
2,"Shallow, poorly imagined and for over 900 pages, thin soup.","This over-hyped genre piece will no doubt appeal to net heads and cyberrats, who have no knowledge of literature and it's antecedents, save Tom Clancy and his ilk, and could care less. Comparisons to Gravity's Rainbow may make good copy, but the idea is laughable and absurd. Pynchon is a serious artist and novelist. Stephenson is a word-drunk, abeit clever, pretender. True art should teach, not simply flaunt itself on the back of the latest ""hot-button"" techno-craze. Unfortunately, a serious waste of time and space. Relentlessly unoriginal."
1,Needs editing,"Let me start by saying I am not a quiter but I came dangerously close to putting this book down numerous times. I muddled through just to satisfy my ""I finished the book"" tendencies. The author should fire his editor because this book could be trimmed down to 300 pages max. The ending was rediculous, total cop out. Yes the sophomoric humor was peppered throughout but you cant polish a turd. If you like techno thrillers read someone else who understands the editing process.Nuff said."
1,Dull and pointless,"I couldn't finish this book, finding I had no desire to read any more after I got about halfway through. There are several concurrent storylines, none of which have anything to do with each other except in the most peripheral sense. The book spends so much time plodding along, I found I had a surge of excitement when he finally got to the announcement of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. At last, something was happening! Unfortunately, the next page began ""Three months later,"". I was incredibly disappointed after hearing the rave reviews this book got, and now I am completely mystified how it received them."
3,TOO MUCH INFORMATION,"Stephenson's novel sprawls, lurches, speeds, then tails away. There are two or three very tight concise novellas competing for one's attention. And the sum is somewhow less than its glittering parts.Nabokov, in ""Despair"", had a passage where the narrator writes, ""must be calm, keep my head. No good going on otherwise. Quite calm. Chocolate, as everybody knows...(let the reader imagine here a description of its making).""I cite this reservation uncomfortably: Stephenson goes to great lengths to establish creditability of intellectual characterization. Many of the asides, in and of themselves, would serve the characters well. But over the course of the novel as a whole, I question how much is characterization per-se, and how much is Stephenson showing his props or simply showing off.Someday this guy is going to write a gem for all time. This novel isn't it, but it's a remarkable start in the right direction."
5,"book is great, tape is short",Just a warning on this audio...this is one of my favorite Neal Stephenson books and Scott Brick is a wonderful reader...I didn't notice until the tape arrived that it said 'unabridged EXCERPTS' on the box. Can you say that? It's only 6 tapes long.
2,Audio book edition - beware!,"A great book, but beware - the ""unabridged"" audio book edition is actually ""unabridged excerpts"" from the book Cryptonomicon. I bought this as a gift for my father who has been dying to read the book but tends to have more time for listening to audiobooks while commuting, and had no idea that I was not receiving the entire book until it arrived."
4,"Bizarre book, but well worth the effort","This was a very strange historical fiction book. It's extremely long, and the author tends to go off on tangents, but I loved the historical aspects of it, and the writing could be phenomenal at times. Although somewhat dry and occasionally a chore to read, I would still totally recommend this book for its unique perspective, and some of the interesting history regarding World War II."
5,Amazed and amused,"Neil Stephenson's work, Cryptonomicon, is a must read for anyone interested in the issues of digital safety. How do we communicate safely? How do we bank safely? Stephenson explores these issues with great humor and fascinating characters that debate the issues of cryptography, of love, war, environmental safety, etc, etc. in this masterwork. It has been ages since a book has made me laugh out loud many times at the absurdities it reveals of its all-too-human characters. The addition of clever graphs and diagrams enhance the enjoyment of learning the art of cryptography (hiding words) and of tunnel digging (hiding treasure). If you like novels that stimulate your thinking about current events, that make you giggle and goggle with amazement at clever thoughts and characters, by all means read Cryptonomicon, and be sure to tell your friends! P.S. - don't be scared by its long length - the story and characters leave you running hard until you sadly enjoy the last page."
4,Complex & insightful,"The title, alone, is interesting enough. I spent a few moments trying to properly pronounce the title. After reading the synopsis inside the covers, I was hooked. This book can be confusing & even more so the more you think about it. So, I just read and enjoyed myself. At times, I enjoyed the WWII segments more and other times I prefered the modern era more. Randy & Lawrence are protagonists are a bit more technically literate than average but are quite likeable and truly find yourself rooting for them. Their discussions with others can be deep and insightful but there is a humorous aspect that keeps everything enjoyable. Cryptography and history may not be the most interesting subjects but they are combined in such a way that you can't help but feel as if you've learned something. This book has stong sense of human nature (past & present), and technology, and where both are headed. I would recommend this book to all anyone who has an interest in either or both subject(s)."
1,"A few good ideas, but still a waste of time","Gratuitous glorification of the dehumanizing ways of the military and the church, full of clichés, demeaning towards women...If you manage to not be bothered by all that, then yes the plot isn't too bad. But with thousands of better books out there, it's still a waste of time.One last warning: if you have any respect for Alan Turing, be aware that this book insults his memory. Shameful."
2,It's an OK read.,"As a person who considers Snow Crash and TDE two of her all time favorite novels, you can imagine how much I was looking forward to reading C. What a dissapointment! I actually liked the small, self-contained digressions (cereal, etc) within the book more than the whole. The arch antagonist (can't even remember his name) was like an afterthought, can't even be compared to Raven. The characters' preoccupation with sex was funny for a while, then got tedious. The math and CS side of it was interesting (Van Eck phreaking!) but I'd say don't waste your time & money with the hardcover, get a condensed paperback."
4,"Not about the destination, but the journey","Cryptonomicon is a truly epic book with a lot ideas, you follow three main characters and one supporting character for just a couple of chapters. The book uses real people and characters to really make it believable. The book spans three characters in 1940's all involved with World War 2 and one character in precent day, which is really late 1999, but you can hardly tell.The best Thing Stephenson does so well is tie all these characters over many lands and time. The ending or Climax was not all that suspenseful and didn't have near conclusion I was looking for. I felt that he didn't spend enough time on the bad guy, in a book of 900 pages he spends about thirty on the bad guy.That being said the journey that the book takes you on is worth the price of this book."
4,read baroque cycle first,"I read this book when it first came out and enjoyed it very much. But I just got around to reading the Baroque Cycle books, and they are about ancestors of some of the characters, so I think it would be more enjoyable to read the Cycle first."
3,"good, not great","It took me three tries to read this book. I stopped the first time because I really don't like books written in the present tense; it seems artificial, and does not add a sense of immediacy as is probably intended. But the story stayed with me. The second time I quit because I was put off by the author's jokey, smart-alecky attitude; I thought if he isn't serious about his characters, why should I care about them? But the story stayed with me. So I gave it one more chance. Making allowances for the previous objections, I found myself zipping through CRYPTONOMICON. It is indeed a worthy successor to GRAVITY'S RAINBOW. The WWII chapters are more interesting and more fun than the present-day parts. Now, my only real complaint is that the one half-way prominent female character undergoes a radical personality transplant during the course of the book. THAT could have been handled better. It need not be thought of as sci-fi at all. Read it as a historical novel."
2,Needless errors and waffle spoil the read,"Based on Neal's previous great books I expected a stimulating thought provoking good read, but was disappointed. What I got was a book that contained a litlle fascinating material mixed in with what I perceive as waffle. As an actuary with a minor interest in encryption, I have read some informative books, and am reasonably familiar with the mathematics. Perhaps the book would have seemed better if I did not have this background. Most disturbing were errors which would not have occurred if minimal and easy research had been done eg armed services ranks used in Australia are not the same as those used in the USA. When I read a book containing basic errors I find it most difficult to accept that other ""factual"" material is either correct or has sound foundations. Based on this book alone, I cannot recommend the author."
2,"Disappointing, with a capital D For ""Diamond Age was the best book he's ever written.""","I'm still trying to convince myself that going from his superb portrait of Nell in The Diamond Age to the rather weak characterizations of Amy and Glory in this book didn't bias the underlying humanist/feminist nature of my critical faculties unduly against this whole enterprise. And while I found his inability to write an ending only mildly exasperating with TDA, it was wholly unacceptable to me in this book. Because? It felt like nothing had happened. I know a lot of stuff happened around the characters, but Bobby and Randy and Amy didn't seem to grow from it. This is the one book of Stephenson's that I've read so far (up next, the Baroque cycle) where he's allowed the technology to overwhelm the characterization. It was disappointing, as he's always been excellent at balancing the two before."
3,I didn't like it,"Unless you have A LOT of time on your hands or the patience for long winded, stream-of-consciousness writing, you'll probably get bored with this book like I did. I was eager to read this book and wanted to like it but didn't get past 100 pages."
2,where are the good editors?,"If you can slog through the verbosity, it is possible to mine some very good fiction out of the messy slag pile of this over-written over-indulgent under-edited book. Why do we have to do the work of the publisher?"
5,an intellection joy-ride of technology and soul,"Cryptonomicon - one of the best perspectives of what is goin on in the world and how one traverses through it. I haven't read a book this illustrative since the Cuckoo's Egg. Though a work of fiction, Stephenson takes you through history and technology like no other and brings it home with a story of a start-up that rivals Grove of Intel. A must read for technophiles and geeks alike, believe me, I'm one."
2,400 Pages too long,"Compared to his other books Cryptonomicon is a waste of time. Unless you are a die hard Stephenson fan who must read everything he writes then don't bother. If you must read it then don't feel guilty over occaisonally skipping 20-30 pages at a time, you won't miss much."
3,"Good, but no plot","Snow Crash was a pretty good book, so i was excited about this because of all the hype. I'm going to repeat a review i heard of this book. Every page has an interesting story and something to say, but there is nothing connecting all of it. Sure it covers a lot of topics, but I was halfway through and still saw no plot to keep me interested. So there you go, its interesting, but didn't keep me engaged as a reader"
5,Cypherpunk not Cyberpunk,"Cryptonomicon is an amazing book that oozes personality and detail. Quite possibly Stephenson's best work to date, Cryptonomicon weighs in at a moster ~1000 pages. Is it worth it? Quite simply yes. The book takes som time to get going, but when it does it truly hums. The only part that I found to be disappointing is the ending, but hopefully that will be aleviated sometime in the near future when Stphenson publishes the sequel."
5,This book will challenge your brain.,"I have read every book written by Neal, and I have yet to find one of his books that doesn't interest me.This book is very well written, will keep your attention and at times will challenge your brain. I found some parts where I had to re-read it several times just to understand what Neal was writing about.I would highly recommend this book it is a pleasure to read."
3,Not wierd enough,"While this still harolds the unique style and perverted sense of humor that Stephenson is famous for, it doesn't seem to have the inspired vigor that Snow Crash or Diamond Age did. It drags on in places, covers the dryer historical details in a tedious and often unnecisary manner, but does occationally shine brightly enough that if you like Stephenson, it's reccomended. If you're a paranoid hacker and believe the world will be taken over by who has the best codes/crackers, then by all means enjoy. If you'd rather wait until Neil can come up with something so wacky and bizarre that you can't believe you just read that, then hold off, and he might get the signal."
3,"Not bad, certain parts of the book didn't seem to fit","Long book. Ending was lame, don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it...but this random dude shows up at the end for no apparent reason (at least to me).a few parts of the book didn't seem to fit, like when randy was trying to get dental surgery."
4,Excellent Storyline,"This book is a very entertaining read. It does and excellent job bridging the two timelines of the story together, giving a good overall picture of the (relative) recent history of cryptography. It is not nearly as sci-fi as some of his other books, and the character development is good enough to make you want to know what happens to them."
5,Highly Technical,"This book is a fabulous example of top notch sci-fi that is firmly grounded in reality. Some of the other reviewers have complained about both the length of the book and the level of technical description in it. To them I shall say this; if you have problems reading long books don't try to read them, and if technical reality bothers you and you don't like things to be fully explained try some Heinlein and stay away from real sci-fi. But to everyone else this is a great book and well worth the read."
5,"A really great book, seriously check out this review,","This book was big when I first looked at it. At around 900 pages it was the biggest book I had ever read, but I couldn't put it down, you are following around three different stories at a time and each one has you there with the characters. Neal Stephenson has created another great work, i seriously suggest getting this book, it will be the best read you have had in years!"
3,A mediocre book in which all the characters sound the same.,"A book that really disappointed me, after reading his article in WIRED about the mechanics of running cable underwater (which was great) I thought this book would be a classic."
3,Promised too much and didn't deliver,"If there's ever been one problem I've had with Neal Stephenson it's that he can't write an ending. I was actually expecting this one to end with ""To Be Continued."" The first 700 pages set up a wonderfully complicated plot spanning 60 years of detailed conspiracy and technical development. Then it all winds down and wraps itself up too neatly. The dense pictures of detailed moments in character's lives suddenly go into speed-search as it draws towards a close and characters and subplots are discarded. The plot was too intense to have lurched to an ending the way it did. Worth it for the entertainment, but it's really disappointing that so many of the story's promises aren't kept."
3,Worth your time,"This book is worth anyone's time, however, if I would do it again, I would not spend the time to read it. I will give it 3 our of 5 stars. Extremely interesting and educational, but too lengthy and boring at times. Stephenson did not put enough effort into keeping me interesting throughout the book. Cryptonomicon does not even come close to Snow Crash, which I read in less than a day. Again, if you have the time, read it."
1,made it to page 150...,"chalk it up to A.D.D. The beginning for the first 50 pages held my interest then it didn't interest me. The WW II aspect of the story started off interesting. I did not care for the modern characters. I didn't give the book much of a chance, you might say, I feel I shouldn't invest my time in something that I might not like.I'll donate it to the library. Disclaimer, I purchased this book at a local book dealer."
4,"Good yarn, silly premise","Stupid treasure hunters. They dig up all these ""Japanese tunnels"", disturbing priceless forest habitat, and leave behind a huge mess for the local community. Just got back from 3 weeks of fieldwork in the Philippines so I'm not making up that rant...That said, this is a good fun book. It's a geek-boy fantasy with puzzles to solve, gold to find, and a hot tough chick like a computer game heroine. More like playing through a game than reading a novel, but definitely good entertainment."
3,Nerdy overreach,"Three strands of plot across time and space progress in parallel - I presume they meet up somewhere down the road. Don't know since I gave it up at around page 200.Too bad, seems like there is a good story in there, but couldn't wade through all the nerdiness - the stylized narrative, the tech/math trivia, verbose descriptives.The book was published in '99, and perhaps it's a reflection of the time - the crest of dot com excess on the eve of bust. It feels adolescent and overambitious.Still, you may enjoy the book if you are into the genre and have the requisite patience."
2,Ego in need of an editor,"The paperback version is more than 1100 pages, printed on thin paper in 8-pt. type. No kidding. It's difficult to hold in your hand, even, like an overstuffed sandwich. It's also difficult to slog through because it's so slow and irrelevant in so many places, has many anachronisms (careless on research other than endless tech details), and filled with overwritten, convoluted prose. Some of it is interesting, much of it is clever, all of it should have been cut by half."
1,Sloppy and Disappointing (but still a Stephenson fan),"I like everything Stephenson has written -- until now. This book needed the hand of a strong editor. The story was conceptually engaging, but I was disappointed by the cluttered writing, distracting tangents, and (in too many cases) absurd and stilted dialog. Even more distracting, however, was the sheer volume of typographic errors. The book was clearly spell-checked by a computer, but... if eye had two reed won moor page wit miss spelled oar wrong lee used words, I thought I was going to scream! I'm a bit of a perfectionist, but this was truly ridiculous!Either someone is getting too big for his britches and refused the help of an editor or someone else was clearly in too much of a hurry to get this book onto the market.Save your money and wait for the paperback -- maybe Avon Books will have hired a good old-fashioned proof reader by then (if not an honest editor)."
2,Not Engrossing,This book I must equate with the Engineer Trilogy in that it's wordy without sustenance. I felt this book was a tough read because nothing about the characters was engrossing. I felt like I was reading sparknotes on the characters' lives instead of living their experiences. Nothing ever really got me excited in this book. Very disappointed in this read.
2,I kept waiting for it to get better - it didn't!,"I had already invested several hundred pages of my time here based on the pre-release reviews. In retrospect I wish I hadn't.I kept waiting for the pace to pick up, for it to get better - it didn't.This is definitely a book for insomniacs looking for a cure. You keep reading though, hooked just to see how someone could go on like this for about a thousand pages and never say anything significant but hoping that they do!"
4,Cryptonomicon,"Neil Stephenson is operating in another dimension from the rest of us. This book, which is probably his best, not only keeps you guessing, it makes you think as you go on. A delight to read w/ fresh, direct storytelling dialog."
5,A slow read?,"This book was indeed a slow read, but in a good way. It was a book that could be savored rather than devoured. I found the mathematical and technical discussions both entertaining and interesting, it is one of the reasons one reads Stephenson, definitely not a negative. Pure pleasure!"
2,Goes nowhere.,For the 910 page investment you get no payoff. His writing is witty and clever but way too wandering. There is no point to anything. It's like watching the charactors go shopping for 910 pages.
5,Great book!,"What I really liked about Cryptonomicon was that it felt well researched and gave a good glimpse (i hope) of encryption during WW2. Also, the intertwined stories are very good and keep you turning the pages. The characters are likeable and you keep wanting to know what will happen to them."
4,Pretty Amazing; a must read for computer geeks.,"At first Cryptonomicon was confusing because the chapters started to alternate between just before World War II and somewhere like a year from now. However, it didn't take long to establish there were two moments in the time line happening here, and that these seemingly unrelated events were being woven together in an intricate pattern. I've never encoutered a story that took this approach and managed to bring it all together at the very last possible moment and make it fit so well. Embedded within the story are references to technology that exists today -- the o/s stuff is real [BeOS,Linux], the crypto stuff [PGP] is real (and well explained!), the math is real. One really has give the author his dues when executable Perl script is a necessary part of the plot. The book was just as educational as it was entertaining. Yes, there were some noticable typos across 918 pages, but it didn't detract at all. Stephenson has a hit."
3,300 Pages Too Long,"An excellent story, very well written, but with way too many asides, and lengthy ones at that. Out of the 900+ pages, I think I only read about 600 - skipped all the pages where he shows his extensive knowledge of acrane information that had little to do with the story. If the editor had chopped out all of that stuff it would be a 5 star read."
2,"A little bit too much blah, blah, blah...",I got 650 pages into this blimp and had the same feeling I have when I'm sitting on an airplane next to someone who 1) won't shut up and 2) won't get to the point. This book is over 1100 pages long with about 400 pages worth of story. I didn't bother finishing because life is too short to squander on this sort of logorhea.
2,Too much stuffing.,Neal Stephenson might well have told his story in some 300 pages instead of 910 if he had left out things like a 17 page email from the story's main character. I found the insertion of Stephenson's pet 'ideas' annoying - they have little to do with the story. Snow Crash was substantially better.
3,Not as bad as Snowcrash,"It has the same problems, as it's overlong trite cyberpunk. However, at least his writing's improved."
3,A Moderately Enjoyable Read,"The book is quite good regarding discussion of cryptography, but the story lacks a bit in maintaining reader interest."
4,Nice 900 page array,"You know those books that are so good, you don't want them to end. Well, this is one of those, but it doesn't. The novel's template/structure is based on an array. But it's an array with a heavy loading of plot(s). I liked ""Snow Crash."" (his breakout book). But it had its gonzo/WWF excesses. This book is more reasonably excessive. (ex: The oxymoron as a point of praise) If you buy the book & don't like it, you've at least got a nice looking doorstop for the rest of your life."
5,A Great Read,"Picking up this book is daunting at almost 1,000 pages. However, I soon came to dread the end of the book; a great--and rare for me--sign that I'm enjoying the hell out of a book. Diamond Age it ain't, but one can hardly blame Stephenson for failing to top that masterpiece.The story and characters are very interesting and believable. Stephenson is in rare form in Cryptonomicon, with his wry humor and penchant for balancing hyperbole with understatement. The story soon sucked me in and had me laughing out loud at times.If the book has a flaw, it has to be with the spell checking. Seriously. Where the hell was Stephenson's editor? I found no fewer than 6 typos (I'm sure there were more) that, ironically, were caught by Stephenson's spell-checking program but not by the human editor who is supposed to ketch such thongs.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is involved with technology, be it working in the industry or just fascinated by it."
4,"Splendid read, absolutely riveting, but the ending ??","As noted above, a great book, a great read and very stimulating. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the whole essence of the book, but as noted by some other reviewers, the ending kind of ""damp squibbed"" me a bit. I didn't want to finish it; I do hope he writes a sequel - but will it actually tell us where the story is going?The crypto is excellent and the use of the first person really draws you into the book; however Andrew Loeb's character is sorely underused and relatively unexplained and then completely discarded, and the germans in the book get a poor run (Rudy and Bischoff; did he survive?)Ah, well, still a great book and well worth the extra shipping to read in the UK before it gets out here. Buy it and see for yourself."
1,Waste of time,"I have read a lot of Stephenson. I expected a bit more from him on this one. The story is choppy and piecemeal. He regularly goes off on worthless tangents which provide nothing to the story. The characters are not at all believable, nor consistent nor well supported by background detail. At one point a character dies then magically reappears later in the story. Then there's this bad guy who shows up in the middle of jungle in a suit and tie and no real reason to be there to wreak havoc and invent some real conflict in this slow moving waste of a book.SKIP THIS ONE!!!"
1,And I bought it in hardcover!..,"If I wanted to know about the consistency of some nerd's soggy Captain Crunch cereal, I could observe it any day almost anywhere at breakfast. The idiosyncracies and hangups of computer professionals do not interest me. That counts out half of this heafty book's plot. The rest is quite interesting: cryptography and warfare in WWII as experienced through 2 characters that have lives instead of funky technology. Is Stephenson telling us that modern man is a boring git? In this case, keep it short and sweet, baby. No rambling. And more girly action, PLEASE. Not all computer geeks wait a year to get layed."
1,Ever heard of a plot?,"After reading Snow Crash and loving it, I was very interested in reading this book. What a waste of time. It wasn't until the last few pages that a recognizable plot developed. The book kept skipping around between time periods, which became rather annoying. Just leave this on on the shelf!"
1,A thousand yawns for nine bucks.,"I decided to stop reading this novel at page 100, and now use it as a paperweight. It's the only way I can rationalize paying nine bucks for one of the most tedious, overwritten pieces of crap I've ever read."
1,900 Bloated pages,The story is good but this guy Stephenson makes two or three sentences out of every one. The book is at best a 400 page novel. If he would get to point and stop sputtering bull!@#$ it would be much better. I am by the way an electrical engineer working in software and find it highly unlikely that any disciplined mind could put up with so much fluff instead of the story. Stephenson is highly overrated
1,Wading through asia,"This is an instance of where once again the author's name is required to sell this puppy. If you like those books where incredible coincidences happen on a fairly regular basis, this book is for you. Grandpa's work together, two superheros in the world of the motals. They split and never see one another again, yet grandson and granddaughter hook up for rousing great fun, out in the miidle of nowhere.it fairly takes the breath away. No wonder all these folks crave cryptography, you cannot go ten pages without ANOTHER amazing coincidence. We see Turing, we see Nazis, we see computer designers and not only do the know each other intimately, but they almost live in each others heads. A long slog through the dark and stormy night..."
5,Cryptonomicon,"One the best works of literary science fiction written in the last 20 years. With a plot spanning > 60 years and flashing between well-written WWII intrigue/espionage and modern computer-geek dystopia, Stephenson delivers his best work since the classic ""Snowcrash"". Who knew cryptography could be so entertaining? Don't let the weight (900+ pages) turn you off, this is a fast paced novel that compels you forward, you won't be able to put it down. 5 stars are not enough."
5,Stephenson's Masterwork Thus Far,"One could rave about the seamless plot, the perfect weaving of multiple timelines, locations, and characters. All of these overflow with color.But it is the pure writing that entrances me. Cryptonomicon's language is beautiful. You can read the same sentence over and over again and enjoy it each time. How rare is that?"
5,Brilliant,I laughed out loud at several points: my daughter kept on looking at me to figure out what the big deal was. This book is FUNNY. It gave me a lot to think about with regard to our privacy. I bought it one Thursday and didn't put it down until the following Tuesday.
4,Entertaining,"This sprawling, joky book is surprisingly successful. Stephenson is all over the map (literally) with a set of complex plots set during both WWII and the present. Codes and the nature of useful algorithms are recurrent themes of the book, as is the clever use of enjoyable conspiracy theories. Stephenson writes with real verve, gleefully bringing in real historical personages like the great Alan Turing and manufacturing a wide variety of fictional historical characters and locations."
1,"Colossally over-written, sporadically brilliant","This will probably win all the major sf awards next year but only because of SNOW CRASH and THE DIAMOND AGE. This book needed an editor BADLY. It's hugely over-written; so much so that characters and plot threads disappear; some drop out altogether. However, it seems that in our culture Bigger is Better and this book has everything in it including the kitchen sink. And one final remark: this is NOT science fiction: it's a mainstream book written like a science fiction novel but it lacks inventiveness, pizzazz, and a considerable amount of joy. I would also add: modesty. Read something else ..."
4,Intricate plot mixes history with fantasy,"For people who tend to be analytical, who like fast-paced intricate plots. For people who are interested (even mildly) in codes and ciphers. For people who like to speculate on the future of the internet and its role in international politics and economics. For people who are interested in the South Pacific battles in WWII.For people who like books where things happen, where the story is the thing and the characters are doers, not navel-gazers, try this mammoth book. It will reward your attention with a robust, fascinating, well-told story about people you'll remember for a long time."
5,Mind Candy for Techno-Weenies,"This is great fun for the technologist and/or cryptologist. Both understand basic math. It switches between World War II and today, yet all ties together by the end of the book. It has anomalies, not the least of which is that a major character killed in World War II reappears very much alive some 50 years later with no explanation. That aside, the stories are individually and collectively interesting and frequently also amusing.Lots of little things are memorable, such as an unusual means of dividing up a bequest among a family of mathematicians. The cryptography is necessarily simplified, and several historical characters are to be taken with a grain of salt. That aside, it's a good book to curl up with when desiring a quiet evening."
2,"Halfway through, I quit","Having tried to get into this book, having read over 500 pages of its bloat, I give up.Way too many poorly defined characters that do very little given the number of pages devoted to them. There is potential here, but only if someone had taken the hatchet to about half the unnecessary text, and also put some life into the characters to distinguish one from another"
5,Awesome,"A book featuring cryptography, war, looted treasure, computer hacking, techno-geeks, jungle expeditions...what more could a boy want?This book is so full of rich detail, humor and even interesting characters that I didn't want it to end. The author must have done an incredible amuont of research. The pace never lags, with multiple story lines and subplots (which unbelievably ultimately tie together).There are few authors whose books I would immediately read when released without regard to subject matter or reviews. After Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson is on that list. I'm waiting for his next one."
4,"Excellent, but it's no Snow Crash","I really enjoyed this book, and it was a good read, if a bit slow at times. If you're expecting another Snow Crash, you won't get what you're looking for. However, it *is* a great book and, as always, it seems like Stephenson really did his research."
1,few good pages,there were few interesting pages here and there but mostly this novel went nowhere and was boring.My first novel of this author and last too.
1,not so intoxicating,"Hats off to those who persevered for 300+ pages before giving this dud up. I only lasted 53 pages, or until I got to this zinger of sentence: ""Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't."" Oh, the tension. Stephenson attempts to write a cross-generational, wide-reaching tome of Pynchon-esque proportions, but misses by a wide, wide mark. And then, after basing his title on the work of the great H.P. Lovecraft (Necronomicon), he admits to never having read H.P.L.!?! The cover blurb of my borrowed (and soon to be returned) copy quotes the Washington Post Book World: ""Intoxicating."" Perhaps it should read Intoxication required. Despite all the glowing reviews here, my recommendation is skip this book."
3,Good but LONG.,"Good writing and story, but I believe one third of the information could have been condensed or left out entirely. The additional information is interesting, but does not add much to the story. I skimed as much as 5-10 pages in some sport just to get back to the action. But overall interesting."
2,Goes nowhere,"Whereas I found the premise interesting, Stephenson's novel falls apart due to implausible characters and a shaky plot. Instead of building a strong, convincing story in the 900+ page devoted to Cryptonomicon, the author chooses to spend chapter after chapter describing technical jargon and cryptography gimmicks that, in many cases, have little to do with the actual story. This over-attention to detail would be forgivable if the plot actually went somewhere, but the novel doesn't seem to have much of a point until around page 850. Even then, I found the ending to be horribly anti-climactic and left feeling completely underwhelmed and unsatisfied.In short, a passable book if you find yourself really bored or interested in code-breaking, but a waste of time for the casual reader who enjoys a plot or, if nothing else, a point."
5,Absorbing!,"Receiving this book as a birthday present I was, due to past experiences, somewhat wary. This book however, makes up for so many door jambs. Neal Stephenson is a story teller in the true sense. He has the ability to apparently veer off into a side show and then tie it essentially to the main thread, his characters are very real and different and importantly, believable. The book contains a number of fascinating insights into WWII, power, people, and of course, cryptography. Cryptonomicon is vast in both scope and detail but manages to remain a thrilling and intriguing read. I believe that this book is approachable by a vast number of people who would normally breeze past the `nerd' section - stretch yourself a little - try it."
4,Cryptonomicon,I found the book fascinating. The way the people who share last names with each other in different timelines slowly come together is intriguing. The language often rises to near hilarious poetical heights. The language is the best feature of the book though the complicated plot is excellent. The ending was disappointing. After all the great material in the entire book the ending was just too convenient and easy.
4,An intelligent thriller,"Much smarter and wittier than the average adventure novel, although I don't feel that it quite lives up to the rave reviews, which led me to expect something like a combination of Douglas Hofstadter and William Gibson. Even as I reached the last few pages, I hoped that the ending would be more... cerebral, or metaphysical, or something a little less obvious or conventional. I was somewhat disapointed that the goal or objective that absorbed the characters throughout this 900 page novel was, in the end, pretty mundane. Oh, well. It was still very difficult to put down, and I devoured the entire book almost all at once (with only a couple of brief breaks to get some sleep).Altogether a pretty good read, although not really interesting enough to make me want the sequel or sequels (according to the book flap, this is the first book of a series)."
2,"Some Sections are Amazingly Good, Overall Rather Poor","This book is about 50-60% too long. There are some really good ideas and incredibly well-written parts, but the writing is very inconsistent. A good editor would've made him keep re-writing until the book as a whole was a diamond - unfortunately instead we got lots of gems scattered through the pages. And hey, some of the gems are as long as 3 paragraphs - but out of a 1000 page book?Worth reading if you've got lots of time to kill and don't mind reading so-so prose for long stretches of pages while waiting for the next gem to come along, but he is so clearly capable of so much better that it seems a shame to support half-baked efforts. Send his publisher a message and do everyone a favor by making NS do his best in the future. Borrow it from a library..."
1,p 434,"My first Stephenson book, and maybe my last. I was interested to read other reviews that indicated that this book was not reflective of his talent. I certainly hope not.The book was overwritten and boring. At page 434, I had invested some time but I just could not care what happens to these boring people in their mechanical lives. Where's the story, I kept on thinking to myself, this will get better, there is so much potential here. I can't help but feel that if he edited the book down to 434 pages, it could have been a great story."
3,900 pages!!,There are some terrific parts to this novel! Bobby Steptoe deserves a sequel. And Lawrence Waterhouse is endlessly fascinating. The modern plot thread really doesn't pan out as much as one might hope. Stephenson can be very funny. BUT IT'S NOT WORTH 900 PAGES! You have been warned.
2,A good editor could have done wonders. And should have.,Stephenson seems to have gotten in the good graces of his publisher to an extent where no one reined him in. The premise was great; the characters fascinating and then the book dribbles to a nonsensical conclusion as if Stephenson really didn't care that much and wanted to move on. Too bad as it's now a huge blemish on his reputation. Hope the next one is tighter. Hear this Neal?
4,minor flaw,"I really enjoyed Cryptonomicon, and give it 4 stars.I was surprised though that the author's research missed something thatmakes the plot appear a bit uniformed.In 1941 Konrad Zuse built the first fully functional, automatic,programmable, general purpose, digital computer. All previous machines(by Pascal, Leibniz, Babbage, Atanasoff, Turing, and Zuse himself) weremere calculators limited to very specific types of operations.For the first 600 pages or so I kept expecting Zuse's machine to enterthe plot - until the book suggested that in 1945 (!) Waterhouse wasthe only one who knew how to build such a machine. Then I realizedStephenson was not even aware of Zuse.Maybe he or someone else will find the above useful for his nextalternative history novel."
3,Insight into the mathematical mind! But sloooow start.,"If you are interested in mathematics, crytography, or computers you should find this book interesting. Also, if you just want to get an idea of how the mathematical mind works this would be a good book to read. After finishing the book I can say that I am satisfied, but I'm not planning on reading any more books by Stephenson.This book is long. Not because it is 900+ pages, but because it doesn't really get going until page 600. The novel shifts between a number of different story lines and I found it hard to keep interested in them all until they began to fall together toward the end. Most of the male characters blend together in that they speak and think the same way. As for the female characters, we get more insight into the life of a piece of Captain Crunch cereal than the life of one of the cardboard-cutout women in this book."
3,Must have been abridged by a business major.,"Firstly, this edition was listed as unabridged when I ordered it. I thought it was too good to be true, and it was. So I started off [angry].I read the book and absolutely loved it, by the way. I bought the audiobook to listen to while driving. Sterling's use of narrative description is just the kind of thing I like listening to on the road. It was also what was ripped from this story to make it fit on six cassette tapes.I suppose in a book of this size something has to go, but it seems that all that is left here are the business deals and legal contortions.For gosh sakes, they cut the ""Ultimate Bowl of Captain Crunch""!."
2,"Long, very long","If someone should ever ask me about Cryptonomicon, frankly I cannot imagine an answer better than ""Well, it's a very long book..."". It is my first book from Stephenson (and probably the last one) and my opinion is that a writer should be less presumptuous and should not release a 918 pages volume before being prepared to that. The story is too fragmented, the plot - if any - is not tangible, and there is an evident intention to reach the 900 pages target. The same subject is covered in 1996 Robert Harris' novel, Enigma, in a better way."
4,great book,"This was an amazing captivating book, I finished it in about 2 weeks, which is very slow considering I usually read at a breakneck pace. What I don't understand are all these people who couldn't finish it(?)I mean I'm still in high school, I'm not a prodigy nor am I well read and I had no problem with whizzing through this and appreciating it."
3,Good-not great,I really liked Snow Crash. I liked this one with 2 reservations:1) Not all parts of the book contribute to pushing the plot forward (I'd cut around 200 pages)2) The end is kind of weak
1,Please read Snow Crash or The Diamond Age.,"The ambition is admirable, but this book is more tedious than Dickens at his worst. Snow Crash is one of the great sci-fi novels of our time. This is not. Please don't waste your money or time with it."
3,Half Right,"I loved the WWII half of the book but just couldn't get into the modern part. I understand why techies probably love it but being an IT naif I can't share in their enjoyment. To pick a nit the book points out that people with access to MAJIC and ULTRA couldn't serve near the front and then puts a group of them behind enemy lines repeatedly as part of an allied disinformation effort. I loved the ending on Fort Drum, the concrete battleship in Manila Bay. The half I liked was great."
4,Great book (especially for high-tech workers),I may be skewed having degrees in Math and Computer Science but I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. Numerous witty asides make the book easy to read. Technical examples are fun and give the book a good pace. Parallel story is awesome. Would've given five stars if an editor had chopped about 200 pages out.
5,Vast saga and still captivating,"So what if it is almost 1000 pages long ?This should not discourage you, au contraire: covering the last 50 years - from WWII to the Internet, from the Nazi Enigma machine to the modern code breaking techniques, from USA to Europe to Asia, using a language that is so Stehephenson-ique - funny, but still educating, entertaining while teaching us so much.One of the best Neal has ever produced. I wish his other books would have the same quality, but unfortunately they do not."
5,"A 900 page ""quick read""?","Oddly enough, yes. Compelling characters, elegantly inter-woven plots, and a fascinating suject matter (crypotgraphy) help. But what really kept my interest was Stephenson's ability to not just illuminate cryptography and hacking, but to take the peculiar approach to thinking imbedded in both ""fields"" and look at the rest of life (sex, relationships, friendship, pesky inheritance allocations, and so on) through those lenses."
3,"Well-written, but ending felt rushed compared to rest of boo","I'm admittedly new to this genre of books. I very much enjoyed reading Cryptonomicon for the depth of detail, the parallel-plot structure, and Stephenson's wit. However, I can't imagine that this book would have much appeal to anyone other than white-male technophiles like myself. If you have no use for modern ""geek-speak,"" you've never struggled with a differential equation, or you could care less what a Riemann-Zeta function is, you won't want to read this book. As an ex-military type, I should say I was very impressed with the military characters in the book and enjoyed Stephenson's portrayal of and respect for the Marines in particular. Bobby Shaftoe was great!"
5,Easily Stephenson's Best,"... This book is easily Stephenson's best. Based on previous works, many people assume it's going to be about SF-ish things, but this isn't. It's partly historical fiction, partly a glimpse into modern hacker culture, and partly a treatise on cryptography. The depths to which Stephenson explores this last part is astounding. He does a wonderful job of describing cryptography in terms a layperson could understand and, around it, he builds a story that's both engaging and entertaining. His characters come alive and are not mere placeholders that serve to move the plot along. Stephenson has really done his homework on this one and it shows. Anyone who has any interest in hacking, in World War II, in cryptography or in action-adventures would love this book. Highly recommended."
4,A good start . . .,"to what is admittedly going to be a trilogy. I look forward to the second installment as the ""setup"" will not be as long.Having read all of Stephenson's books in print (including his two ""Bury"" novels) I must say that this is closer to the Bury novels in style -- heavy on small detail; this is not a complaint. Although I still prefer ""Zodiac,"" ""Snow Crash,"" and ""Diamond Age,"" this novel is quite good. He takes a while for things to get going, but with the number of characters he juggles this was to be expected (especially having read the ""Bury"" books). Stephenson knows how to grab a reader and hold on. And though I agree the ""too long"" comments aren't wholly accurate, I bit more editing would have been appreciated. A rewarding read to those with the wherewithal to attempt; it also helps if you majored in a math-heavy discipline!"
4,"take out the ""modern-day"" bit and you have Gravity's Rainbow","Good book, almost great. Although Cryptonomicon divides its time between the 90s and the 40s, I'd have settled for the 40s. Stephenson is an exceptionally intelligent writer, however, and we can safely expect even better things to come."
3,teaser preparing for a sequel?,"Premise on how encryption was critical for winning past wars and how anonymous data havens could be even more important for business is very topical. However, it is just too long (900+ pages). Lots of Neal's long winded colorful techno analogies are entertaining, but perhaps he should refrain from including so many of them in a fiction work and publish more purely technical essays like IN THE BEGINNING ... WAS THE COMMAND LINE. Furthermore, the forces that build through the book are only just starting to become an interesting plot device for a radically new world order when the book just ends. I guess I was hoping the book would actually deal a bit with this pervasive encrypted Internet. Perhaps this is just a teaser ending to prepare for a sequel, which could be much more interesting than what essentially is a speculation on how encryption could become even more important than the Internet."
3,I put in three starts but have no idea how to rate the book properly.,"Reading was very exhausting. At times - extremely boring. Had to skip much of the lengthy and meaningless to me stuff. However, the main idea is just brilliant. The entire plot seems to be quite doable. Wonder what keeps some smart guys with resources from setting up something like that in our real life. It could have been done even on a governmental level just to teach the most of our civilized world an ugly lesson. I think, someone, like Russia or China, could have created some sort of a proxy world with its virtual economy if they wanted to by secretly acting behind some sort of international private consortium. That could become an ultimate weapon of mass distraction targeting the very roots of international law and order and no state would have been able to stand against such power. No rating for this book cause there is such a huge quality gap between the superb idea and the sleeping pill of the author's text."
3,A good read - could benefit from some editing.,"If you liked Snow Crash you will like Cryptonomicon.The character development has many nice touches.Swear words in the characters' dialogue is normal, but the use of swear words in the author's narrative bothered me. As did referring to Japanese as Nips.I approve of the inclusion of some technical computer science, math and cryptography."
3,3.49 stars.,"Stephenson has a gift for breathing vitality, energy, and wonder into scientific concepts which could easily become dull and lifeless. _Cryptinomicon_ is a wonderful read. But after reading _Diamond Age_ and _Snow Crash_, it's become obvious to me that Stephenson *does not* know how to subdue the ending. For those who aren't aggravated by weak endings, and for people who'd love to read the best spin on cryptography written, I'd highly recommend this book."
3,"Good book, should be shorter","I think this book would double in value if its length was cut in half. It has a nice technical atmosphere - I especially like its bashing of political correctedness and academic pseudo science - but it's more a book for nerd sympathizers than a book for true nerds, there are too many small inaccuracies. For instance, swimming in the Bismarck Sea using the North star as a guide? Nah, Bismarck Sea is south of the Equator..."
3,Stephenson needed an editor for this book,"Fact is, it is too damn long and takes forever to get to the point. When you are still wondering where the book is going after 500 pages, there is a problem.It doesn't help that the WWII story is far more interesting than the ""modern"" story, especially when the modern story hasn't aged all that well. He should have focused on one or the other.That being said, there is a lot of good stuff in there. I wish it all came together better than it did."
1,Did anyone finish this book?,"Oh my god... this book is SO boring! I love Stephenson's writing style, and his witty observations on the world. But I don't read stories for that. I read them for an interesting plot and characters. This book has characters, but no plot. Can anyone even say what the point is, apart from a few drab men wandering about breaking codes in WWII while in the future another sets up a company laying pipelines? Is that fun reading? Whoever finds that enjoyable really needs to get out more, I think. Either that or I'm just not wild and crazy enough for a book like this.I read 500 pages in hopes that a plot would develop and I would be rewarded at the end. Alas, I couldn't make it through and began reading a much better book (A Game of Thrones). Computer geek or not, you need a lot of free time and patience to finish this sleeper. If you don't have it, please don't bother with this one."
1,Cryptonomicon or a lesson in tedium,I found this book to be tedious in the extreme.It is way too wordy and is very disjointed.I am an avid reader but the only thing I could look forward to with this book was finishing it so I could finally put the darn thing away!
2,But what's it all mean?????????,"He writes well about - nothing. If a sitcom could become a mega-hit, perhaps this plot-less novel could do. Only problem is, its over a thousand pages looooonnnnnnggggg, and I'm only on page 250. Help! Make me stop!"
2,Paid by the word,"The book was terribly long and boring. The author obviously is paid by the word. I regularly skipped 2-4 pages out of 10. So, roughly 500 of 1100 pages were useless description and digressions that did nothing to further the plot or characterization.I'm sorry I spent 8 bucks."
1,"Pretentious, ponderous, and self-absorbed","I was only able to get to page 64 of this clunker. Genitalia is mentioned often; the author even manages to slip in a reference during the attack on Pearl Harbor.I should mention that I am not a fan of cyberpunk, and thought Snow Crash was only OK."
5,wickedly funny,"While hard to plow through at times, well worth the gems discovered. Insightful and honest reflection of hacker's view of the world."
4,Interesting and entertaining,"My 3rd Stephenson novel. Also read ""Reamde"" and ""Snow Crash"". This was an interesting story and made me want to do historical research into some of the events related in the novel to see what was real and what were fictitious inventions by Stephenson. I'll agree with other reviewers that the first third of the book was a little slow, but it comes together especially as you see the connections between the WWII characters and the present-day characters come into focus. Anyone with a deep interest in mathematics or cryptography will probably find the technical details in the novel to be absorbing, but for me I basically just skimmed those pages and re-commenced reading when the story re-commenced. At this point, I have to rate ""Reamde"" as my favorite of the three, and this one as my least favorite. But any way you look at it, Stephenson is some kind of genius."
3,It's Neal Stephenson,"I have to be honest, I couldn't finish this novel. No one is more surprised than me. I love everything else Neal Stephenson has written. I've been trying to put my finger on why I didn't like it. The characters are well developed, he's certainly done his research, and although I wouldn't say the plot moves on at a cracking pace, that's what we've come to expect from this author.In the end I think it's because once again Americans save the world. With all due respect to our friends in the U.S. occasionally something of significance does occur without your input.Anyway Americans will probably love it but everyone else may find it a bit hard to swallow."
3,Boring,"I started and stopped and restarted and stopped this book over a period of a couple years just trying to slog through it. I love history; I like math; I can enjoy a long narrative. If I had to choose a part of the book that I liked, I would say the parts of the novel about Bletchley Park and Bobby Shaftoe's commando missions in WW2 were interesting and I found myself skipping pages to get back to those story threads. But just about all the rest of Crypto was a total snooze-fest. I can't see myself reading anything else in the Baroque Cycle."
3,Much Fluff,"It was a struggle to finish this book. The book is an excellent 400 page novel crammed into a 900 page tome. I can't believe that the book wasn't heavily pruned by an editor prior to release.Some parts of the book are indeed very entertaining and funny. At other times, it's like reading the phone book."
3,Not my cup of tea...,"Yes, I read all 910 pages of this monster. No i did not understand a lot of it. Is Neal Stephenson from another planet? There must be some pretty smart folks on this earth. Maybe I missed something? I guess I'll read it again, naw i think I'll stick to Harry Potter! My brain hurts after reading this thing. And I thought The Satanic Verses was complex!"
2,"Fits good, cheaper quality","I love the feel of this glove but when it came to the durability, they just didn't stand up to what I expected."
5,Work gloves,My son requested these gloves last Christmas as he works outdoors in his job. They seem to have held up so far and he is hard on gloves.
5,Mysteriously hypnotic,"I just finished reading this book; my first by Thomas Cook. I have read many mystery novels and although there have been a few I dearly loved, I must say that this one kept me reading until I found out the conclusion of the murder. Usually, I read at night so as to fall asleep, however, this one kept me awake. Sorry to say I was tired the next day, but it was a happy tired. I will read his other books. Great!!!!"
5,Fantastic as usual!,"I LOVE the way this guy writes! I thought THIS time I had the ending all figured out, but I was wrong again. The end was totally unexpected, just as all the other ""Cook-books"" I've read. You get ""hooked"" from the beginning and think you know what's going on, but you're constantly having to RE-think. Cook is totally different from any other author I've read. I highly recommend him!"
3,Gone too far,Breakheart Hill held me spellbound from start to finish and I have read all of Cook's works since then. This one is not up to par. Cook's use of the mind flipping plot twist is used to a sickening degree. When I discovered the truth I felt nothing but hatred and disgust for Graves. There was no humanity in this character. Lots of maudlin self pity but not much else. I guess I just didn't buy into the premise that there was no choice.Despite all this the book is still well written. Cook has a way with words. Usually he has a way with plot as well but Instruments of Night falls short.
5,Another fantastic suspense story by Cook.,"As soon as I finished this I ran around telling everyone I know to read it. I have read all of Cook's books, and think this is the best yet. It is interesting to read some of the other reviews and the negative reactions. I was surprised, horrified, and entertained throughout. This book has the best descriptions of the process of artistic imagination that I have ever read. Five stars."
1,Pass on this one,"I found the idea of Paul Graves, a mystery writer, being summoned to an old, wealthy estate for the purpose of solving a 50-year old murder improbable and unbelievable. I kept hoping for it to get better, but it didn't. Too many gruesome details of Graves' sister's death. I think the author could have done better."
2,"Flawed, unmemorable","This novel has many serious flaws, beginning with the author's turgid, overwritten style. I honestly don't think I will remember much about it three months from now, so I wouldn't say it is memorable. The premise -- a mystery writer asked to solve a fifty year-old crime -- is not believable. The dialogue writing is painful. I can't recommend it."
2,A dismayingly unconvincing novel from a gifted author.,"While this book will appeal to hard core Thomas H. Cook fans, it is far from the standards set in his other efforts or even his early nonfictional work EARLY GRAVES. His character, Graves, lacks sufficient depth and the book breaks down into a very unconvincing ending."
5,Deserving all the accolades,"For once, the reviews and praises boasted by the book are true. This is a great book; disturbing and emotionally evoking. The conclusion gutted me and lingered on. I re-read the last two chapters and savoured the impact. Thomas H. Cook - what an author! In the last two months, among other mystery novels, I have read Michael Connelly's 'The Black Echo' and Minette Walters' 'The Sculptress', both award-winning books and highly praised. And Thomas H. Cook's 'Instruments of Night' ranked above these, hands down."
2,Confused.,"First, I have to say that ""Breakheart Hill"" is one of my favorite books. I buy copies whenever I see them so that I have them on hand to give to friends. So I expected great things from our boy Cook.But Instruments of the Night left me cold. The most difficult part of the book was the way-overboard extremes of graphic sadism, violence and cruelty (think James Ellroy). The writing is, as usual, masterful, but in addition to the disturbing gruesomeness, I found the end confusing (I've read hundreds of mysteries, and this is probably the only one that I just didn't ""get""). I assumed all along who Sykes was, and think the ending confirmed my supposition. But who killed Faye? I'm still not sure. Perhaps I had too many expectations going in, but I found the book more frustrating and nasty than enjoyable."
1,crashed and burned,"Simply stated, this toy does not fly. Instead, the launcher sends it approximately 4 feet away, and as soon as the momentum from the launcher is expended, the toy dives into the ground. Honestly, I think it would ""fly"" just as well without the wings, since it clearly never glides or floats at all. A complete rip-off, and a huge disappointment for my daughter, who tries to make all her dolls fly one way or another. It's back to the helium balloons for us. . . ."
3,Ok,"My daughter received this for Christmas, i dont have much to say about it, its kind of boring. My daughter played with it for about 5 min and hasnt touched it since. It doesnt seem to be designed very well, the doll and shooter are heavy and does not shoot very far."
3,Sonic Puzzler.,"Three stars because this game is fun, but it is a standard puzzle game. If you like puzzle games it does have its own little tricks to make it different, but is somewhat like Tetris Attack. A fun game but no need to get unless you want to complete your Sonic collection or are a big puzzle game fan."
1,I'm disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. It wasn't anywhere near as good as the previous story lines. And she's writing another. It had better be better than this one because this was no good.
3,Good Compilation of thoughts on Supply Chain,"This is a Compilation of good articles. It gives an idea about Supply Chain thoughts developed over a period of time. We cannot see all articles connected and establish a chain of thoughts because it seems a book was not planned when the author was writing these articles. However,Very good book for knowing the fundamental concepts of supply chain."
3,"basic and introductory, a mix of articles on logistics","Gives a rough idea on supply chain management.Fails to elaborate on he subject, sometimes no link between one article to other. The author has the ability to explain very well. Better to take some leading journal articles for discussion."
2,A series of articles does not make a book.,"I was disappointed. Make sure you understand that this book is a compilation of a series of articles that appeared from mid-1980 to mid-1990. Two problems arise: 1) Since each article is brief, there is no depth to the subject matter, and 2) though a valiant attempt was made to organize the articles into logical chapters and categories, the truth-of-the-matter is that the flow of information from one article to another can be disjointed and difficult to follow. With all due respect, the author points this out in his Introduction, but alas, I had already purchased the book."
3,Good for beginners,"The first half of the book is a really well-written beginners introduction into the world of cigars, their history, making, smoking, storing and other vital knowledge.The author's an expert, and he' renowned, no doubt about it. That said, I'd appreciated that much more if he would have missed just a single opportunity to ply the reader with that fact.The second half of the book therefore is rather a description of the self-absorbed world of Richard Carleton Hacker - who I had never heard of before, but now I know he shared a cigar with Arnold Schwarzenegger - and he couldn't help including a photo of that.That aside: A truly enjoyable read for everybody who is into cigars."
3,Great if you want to learn more about cigars,"I am a big cigar smoker, as such I have a way I like to do thing with my cigar i.e. removing the band. Hacker tells you how he wants you to smoke and why you ought to smoke the largest ring cigar you can find. Don't buy into all of that smoke what you like to and how you want to. Other than that whine, I thought the book was good a little dated but a good read no the less."
4,book in great condit price good delivery fast,"The book was fine, the price great, the delivery fast and the credit card number I used got phished and was abused. Take care."
3,boohbah,"it doesn't come with the movie peekaboobah........just the doll, even though it saids, humbah boohbah doll, the pic made me think that it came with the movie as well. but it didn't. which makes anyone else think the same thing. this is the reason i thought being a little doll, $20 for the movie was a great deal, not $20 for just a tiny doll."
1,Misses the mark...,"If you follow the measurements, your dishes won't taste like traditional korean food found in restaurants. Korean cooking is all about the little details, which the author appears to have left out. He appears to be only vaguely familiar with the intricacies of Korean cusine. This is not a book you'll refer to over and over. I would try one of the Korean authors cookbook if you want something real."
1,Lots of Inauthentic Substitutions,"I would have liked a book of 'authentic' Korean recipes. The author assumes no one has access to many of the needed ingredients, so he simply offers substitutions that may or may not be adequate. A more suitable approach would be to offer the original receipe WITH optional substitutions listed. His other bookThe Exotic Kitchens of Indonesia: Recipes from the Outer Islandsdoes the same.Bibliography lists books of herbs, no history, culinary or cultural references whatsoever. Explanation of cooking methods, equipment and typical ingredients is nonexistent."
1,McDonald's?,"I shy away from cookbooks written by non-native authors in general, but I do give them a chance. And whereas this cookbook is slightly more comprehensive than most Korean cookbooks, there are no pictures and without them one is left to one's own devices when it comes to food presentation.Another concern: the author admits in his preface that during his trips to Korea, he'd ""take breaks"" from the cuisine by visiting McDonald's to ""sooth his tongue."" If the author doesn't enjoy the cuisine he's reviewing/compiling, perhaps the McDonald's Corporation might be willing to subsidize his next project?I re-sold my copy."
4,Best Korean cookbook,"As a korean/american,I grew up with my mother's korean cooking but never learned to duplicate her dishes. Now that I am older, I regret this very much. I have made many of the dishes in this cookbook and the results hav been delicious. I am kitchen-illiterate and found the instructions easy to follow. I purchased another copy for my older sister, and together we make dishes we were used to having often, and some that only our mother had made on special occasions. I highly recommend this book to beginners as well as culinary chefs."
2,"Ok, but would you make it if you had never seen it?","This book does cover many Korean recipes, but it misses a few very common Korean foods (like kimpap, etc.). The titles are also only written in romanized Korean, which may not be the end of the world, but is an annoyance and a hassle at times. The book does have good explanations of certain foods, but does not really impress. No pictures, either"
5,Powerhouse Desktop Replacement,"This is an awesome system. I purchased it on a great deal and have been using it regularly for about 2 weeks. The pluses include: fantastic keyboard, FAST system, great battery life (3+ hours, great for a desktop chip), 60gb HDD, S-video out, dedicated video memory (most feature shared), large bright display ... 533mhz system bus, DVD burner, V92 modem, intergrated ethernet, etc. Minuses: documentation is a little scant especially regarding the DVD drive, some keys are oddly placed (I am getting used to that though), if you use floppies there is not built in drive, if WiFi is your thing it is not included, and it is heavy (not a concern for me). Believe me, this system is fast and fully featured. If you don't have to travel much with it, buy it, you may not need your desktop system! Enjoy."
1,New Toshiba Satellite 2455-S305 Does not work,"I just got Toshiba Satellite 2455-S305 for not too long. The machines started to act strange without any other physical or virus reason. It is not physical shaken, and the XP virus patch is up to date. In addition to the hard drive does not work, the screen displays blurring text, and becomes black sometime."
4,"Lets go ""Where the Boys Are""",I wanted to go back in time to remember the innocence of dating and meeting. It's a really good movie to lose yourself in time.
4,Beach Parties...,A fun movie although it has a dark side to it which today may seem pretty tame to some. All the cast were good and Connie Francis is just great.
5,Where the Boys Are - movie,This is one of my two top favorite movies of all time. It was still a time of innocence in movies when things were alluded to rather than shown. Kids go away for Spring vacation to Ft. Lauderdale and kick up their heels. Back then kicking up their heels consisted of drinking a lot and that was pretty much all. It's a great movie and I highly recommend it. Connie Francis was introduced in this movie and she sings the title song in her most beautiful velvet voice.
5,Fun times!!,"Brings back great memories of how great life was and how innocent and wonderful those times were, compared to life today!"
5,Watched this years ago,"I was talking to my sister who had never seen this movie. So I looked it up on the internet and found that I could watch it via Amazon. We watched it, and LOVED IT. I am in my mid 50's now.....I wished things were even 1/4 of the way they used to be in the 70's."
4,Where the Boys Are,It's as good as I remember. Fun college kids heading out for spring break with a twist & strong moral theme. Wonderful musical numbers.
4,Great for baby boomers!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I loved it years ago, especially the opening song. Even though it is somewhat dated now, basically the problems and emotions that young people in love go through are the same. Very enjoyable and good price at Amazon."
5,George Hamilton please.,"This movie was one of the overlooked beach party movies. It has taken the spring vacation and showed both sides. The fun and the horror of meeting too many men too fast.Yes love will find it's way. When it comes to seeing one of the best looking men in that time it was George Hamilton. And he plays one of the sexy, kind and sweet men that you really want to dream of and meet. The movie has alot of fun in it and it also was very real."
5,Where the Boys Are,I was never allowed to dare to think about going to Spring Break; when I was in college it was nothing but work work work!!!!
1,where the boys are,i didn't know it was a comentary type i wanted the movie not what paula prentise thought of it i love the movie where the boys are and was expecting the original
3,College Soap Opera,"One of those college-kids-on-spring-break movies. I believe it was one of the first in this genre. Wants to be everything: a beach movie, a comedy, a musical, a soap opera. Worth it to hear Connie Francis."
4,Where the Boys Are,"I viewed this original movie many years ago and found it to be funny, but serious in the values I was raised with. You can't miss the lessons of honesty and morality which seems to be almost non-existent in the movies and culture of today. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,A great nostalgia film,"Wow, it's hard to believe all these hep cats are grandparents now, but anyway..time flies. It's a fun beach movie with some great lessons mingled in with the sand, sun and gasp! sex. I love putting on my Coppertone and sailing away to the 60s for a few hours!!"
3,A Cautionary Tale,"This is a fun movie, but it also touches on some very adult topics such as rape and suicide. It's NOT for children, and it's not beach blanket bingo! If you have teenage girls or boys, this is probably good viewing for them and may even act as a springboard for family discussions about the dangers of dating and love."
5,Love Love Love This Movie,I have always loved this movie and bought it after telling my two teenage daughters about it. They could not believe that teenagers in 1960 acted pretty much the way they do (minor exception - I do not think girls today are so marriage-minded as they were then) now. I have not watched the movie in years and it was fun to see all the scenes that I had forgot about. Great Movie!!
5,Happy Days,I haven't seen this film in a long time. I lived this life every spring during break. I was a student at Ft. Lauderdale High and graduated '55. Growing up in South Florida at that time was great. No drugs or hatefulness going on. All of us kids had a wonderful time. When spring break came us girls would rent a motel room for a week and spend the time at the beach. The Elbow Room played a big part in our adventures. I'm ordering the movie tonight and can't wait for it to get here. All the places used in the movie are the places where we hung out. A Ronner
4,Mother Dorothy becomes an heiress,"Mother Dorothy's godmother is in a local hospital awaiting a hip replacement. Suddenly the shocking news comes that she has died before the operation could take place. Mother Dorothy is the sole inheritor of her godmother's estate and she uses it for various worthwhile causes. Meanwhile, other bodies begin to turn up in the hospital. The deceased seem to have no relationship to one another, but there are too many bodies for it to be a mere coincidence. Sister Joan and Detective Sergeant Mill begin investigating and are puzzled by a seeming lack of motive to tie the deaths together. Finally the detective's legwork begins to pay off and the perpetrator is revealed. As always, this is an enjoyable mystery with likeable characters and enough red herrings to keep the reader guessing to the very end."
5,Heartwarming love story...,"This is the third book in the Wilmont brothers series...By King's Decree is the first and Lord Of The Manor is second.I usually end up reading these kind of series out of order, which is the case with this book, but you don't really need to have read the previous two to enjoy this one. While they do make references to things that happened in the hero's past, it's usually only enough to make you think...hmmm, I need to get those books to find out what happened!! This story is a sweet story about a woman who is raising her twins which she had out of wedlock and a man who discovers that there is more to life than wenching & wandering! Not much sex here...but a nice story indeed!"
3,"NOT THE MOST MEMORABLE BOOK, BUT A MODEST PRICE!","For someone who is not from New York, or even from the U.S.A, this book leaves us hanging when it comes to a complete accounting of the Twin Towers. No where in the brief 32 pages, does the book actually show us what the interiors of the Towers were really like or what life inside the Towers on a day-to-day basis was all about. Yes, there are some beautiful exterior photographs, but the book lacked information and detail. It seems that these days everyone is writing and publishing a memorial tribute to the tragic events of September 11. There are certainly a wide variety of more detailed, higher quality books in the marketplace than this one, and many are quite reasonably priced."
3,Well-intentioned tribute with some limitations,"Slim, photo-packed hardcover rembrance of the World Trade Center. Most of the photos (all in color) were taken in the August 2001 and are supplemented with some descriptive text. A few photos are included of the WTC's construction. The 2001 photos show the towers from nearly every conceivable angle and vantage point in and around Manhattan, but a more thorough tribute would have included some photos of the interior of the towers, the plaza in between, and probably a few views from the observation deck. Still, it's hard to be overly critical right now and the price is pleasantly non-exploitative."
4,World events - Ten years later,"Briefly,This book is a tribute to the World Trade Centre itself and its iconic position on the New York Skyline (a city I have never had the pleasure to visit). The strength of this book lies in its relatively distant aproach that conveys the scale of the loss on the 11th September without forcing the reader to relive any potentially traumatic footage of that day. The Stunning aerial footage of the buildings and the skyline make this book a memorable keepsake. Final Say? I would commend this book for a kinder evocation of catastrophic loss such as was suffered. A book for all age groups. Many Thanks,- Irish Reader."
5,Good Product,"Nice product with nice nipple. Good look and feel. With rough use, it worked for one year. Fast shipping."
5,Hare's Choice,"Please, someone reprint this book!My copy is constantly on loan to kids and adults. The story is uplifting, addresses death, mourning, and is extremely uplifting; which is so difficult to find in this age group. It is nice to see a teacher that responds with creativity and sensitivity for a change. Bravo! Please reprint."
5,Great external enclosure,"Don't worry about overheat, made with aluminum (both: external cover and internal tray) and 4cm cooling fan inside. Enclosure dimensions: 10.5"" x 6.55"" x 2.4"" (0.95 Kg), Box dimensions: 13.5"" x 7.6"" x 3"" (34.5 x 19.5 x 7.5 cm).Transfer rate: up to 480Mbits/sec USB 2.0 (USB 1.0 compatible), Controller Interface Type: ATA-66/100/133, Interface support: HDD (without side bracket), CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW (3.5"" and 5.25"" drives).The box comes with :* 100-240V/12V (1.7 Amp) adapter* USB cable* Drivers CD* Screws (for use with the drives)Too fast installation process, in one minute my external enclosure (with my hard disk put in it) was recognized for windows XP (not need the included drivers cd). Excellent enclosure, just take care the power adapter, because the ones 1.7 Amp are relatively expensive. Highly recommended."
5,"The Sooner You Buy, The Smarter You'll Be!","Whether you're a newbie to the music industry trying to get a leg up on your career, a hardened gamer who has seen and done it all, or someone who's just in the mood for a good laugh -- you owe it to yourself to buy this book! George, ""The Fat Man"", Sanger is one-of-a-kind and tells a story like no other. You may even learn something from his life-lessons along the way. I know I did!David RippyEnsemble Studios"
3,A mostly entertaining romp,I found this book in the bargain bin at a local book store. I play music and am interested in recording.I found the book entertaining mostly because the character of the author really shines through. He seems like a kind of Hunter S. Thompson of this small and fairly obscure musical niche.He drops lots of names and there are many inside jokes. One can get a bit lost in all of the people who pass through the book. I found some nuggets of wisdom about music and dealing with people and mostly I was entertained.I think Mr. Sanger would be an entertaining person to have a drink with.
2,"Too stiff, too big","I only wear PVC aprons since I first purchased one 36 years ago in England. I purchased this apron early last year, and there it hangs on a hook, hardly worn. A beautiful, colorful apron. But it is too stiff and not sized/cut properly for a good fit, unless you are 6 ft+. If I tie it at my waist, the stiff bib top almost hits my chin. At the same time I also ordered a Ulster Weavers Rooster apron which always fits properly. I will be using this apron to re-cut and sew the apron as the chili motif is beautiful.C.S"
3,Fair quality,I was a bit disappointed with this apron. I was expecting a nice cotton and this looked more like plastic coated.
5,better than pictured,bought for my adult son who has just taken up cookingfab. patterncrisp picture and bright colorsnot feminine so good for a young adultdarker pattern will not show soils as much
3,Faded,"I don't like the material of this apron. It has a white back which makes me think that after awhile it will start peeling, it's thin and after the first wash it really faded. It was dark blue but after one wash it's now the color of an old pair of jeans. Even though I like the faded color better, I don't think something should fade that dramatically after the first wash. I won't buy another one of these."
4,it is very good,the quality is very good itdoes it job as an apron i like it very much highly recommend this product
3,style/shape not as shown in picture,"The material is very good quality, the stitching is great, and the print is beautiful, just like the picture. The neck loops adjust well. Where this item disappoints is in the style/shape. It does not look at all like the picture. The bib (upper) part is quite long, while the skirt (lower) part is short. Is it supposed to tie around the hips rather than the waist? Also, the ties are too short to wrap around and tie in front. I can't give this more than 3 stars."
4,Advise,"I bought this book for my daughter who was 20 at the time. She said it was informative, but corny!"
1,Just read it in a bookstore,"This ""book"" is really more like a Redbook article. Generic advice doled out in a wafer-thin dose. My daughter received this as a gift and read through it in minutes. Interested parties could merely read any interesting sections while browsing in a bookstore. While there are books of few words, such as the Tao, that offer much depth, this book was begging for an editor to say, ""Maria you need to put a little more thought into this and develop your themes""."
2,Sooooo simple and basic,"Ok, this book is cute and sweet- I'll give it that. However, it is so amazingly basic. I guess common sense in this world is truly uncommon. I read each chapter and said to myself-""Where's the revelation here?"". The only insight here is that if you have star power and write a sappy book to the right audience, you cash in. Good for Maria."
4,Perfect Gift,"Great book, an easy ready and for graduation, esp for a girl high school graduate, a perfect and inexpensive gift. Have been giving it out to my athletes for a few years now."
3,And One More Thing Before You Go,"I did enjoy the book. A lot of what she had to say was common sense, but said we a bit of humor!"
5,What a bargain,"Used this snorkel for two long excursions this past week. After a little adjustment time, I was able to learn the snorkel's quirks and it performed like a champ. No big surface blow required to clear this thing and you know it's working when you hear the valve close. The mouthpiece is tough enough to take a bite and the stem is easy to work with. It's probably better than snorkels three times it's price. Great, great bargain!"
1,Great book but A cassette??,"The book is good. But be aware the audio is a horrible cassette. I don't even own a cassette player. Thus, the purpose of listening to the sounds is lost. DON'T BUY THIS! I must say, it was my fault for not reading the cover before ordering but in this current times I would have never expected a cassette."
5,Fold down cleats,Pleased to find the Aluminum cleat as the white cleats chip easily and look worn. Solid and strong good product.
3,Another entry in the WHO wrote Shakespeare controversy.,"The Shakespeare Conspiracy starring Derek Jacobi was never received. I have, however, read good reviews of this piece and will at sometime in the further try and order another copy !!!."
2,"boring, and too scary","My three year old daughter loves most things Pooh, especially if Roo and Lumpy are involved, but she did not enjoy this movie. The embedded ""flash-back"" was a boring, obvious filler, and the rest of the movie relied on scare tactics instead of an actual storyline. Half-way through the movie my daughter just got up and wandered off. I'm glad I ordered it used for just a couple of bucks."
4,Good movie,"My 5 year old says this movie is ""Spooky fun"" but too scary for his little brother. It was a cute movie, great for Halloween!"
2,An okay movie,"Overall, I think kids will enjoy this movie. In my own opinion, the piglet segment went on for far too long and really got off the track of what the movie was supposed to be about -- which was Roo and Lumpy's quest to save Halloween. Also, I didn't like the fact that Pooh selfishly binged on everyone's candy, leaving none for anyone else and really didn't seem all that sorry about it. I bought this movie based on the fact that it was a Pooh movie, but in retrospect, I don't think I would purchase it again. My advice -- rent it first. If you like it, buy it. At the very least, it's worth a rent."
2,Big Disappointment,"This movie was a BIG disappointment. My daughter and I are huge Winnie the Pooh fans, and we had been looking forward to the release of Pooh's Heffalump Halloween ever since we saw the first Heffalump movie. Unlike that movie, which was charming and endearing, this one is ponderous, uninteresting, and contrived. The previews show only the good scenes and leave out the sleep-inducing flashback to a previous Halloween where Piglet was scared half to death. And the movie ends with a yawn; the theme of unconditional friendship never really came out like it did in the original Heffalump movie. And where was Owl? He has been MIA ever since Piglet's Big Movie in 2003. I give this movie two stars only because my daughter and I love the characters so much."
1,Just Awful,"Do not spend your money on this movie...ours is going in the trash...I won't even donate it because I don't want it to scare another child out of their mind. A ""tree of terror""? Is that really appropriate for a preschooler?? The Heffalump movie was so good...I was really expecting this to be enjoyable, but it is way too over the top as far as the fright factor goes...unless you plan on sprinting to your child's bedroom several times tonight when a bad dream happens, don't bother with this horrible movie. Shame on the creators."
1,What a rip off!,"I thought that the other Heffalump movie was so cute, that this would be cute, too. Well it was a rip off! Why would I want to buy a DVD with a ""new story"" so that I can see a flashback from one of the Winnie the Pooh cartoons for Saturday Mornings on ABC.Not only is it frustrating to see a flashback for what feels like half of the movie, it also features the poor animation quality from a Saturday Morning cartoon.How lame!I'd give it zero stars if I could!"
1,What a rip off,"My 5 year old son still loves Pooh, but he wanted me to forward half of this video because the flashback was ""boring"". He said that he had already seen this part of the movie. So, even though he likes watching his other Pooh videos over and over, we have watched this once since purchasing it."
3,It's just OK...,"We have watched to first Heffalump movie over and over. We like other's, were very excited for this to be released. My son watched it for a while and then got up and went in his room to play. He hasn't asked about it again all day. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on it. I would just stick with the first one or buy it next Halloween when the price goes down."
1,recycled movie....,"ever since we bought poohs heffalump movie, that is all we have watched. as you can imagine, we were anticipating the halloween heffalump movie. when we watched it, i was disappointed. this movie was basically recycled as ""Boo to you too"" the first pooh halloween movie, was part of this movie. the animation is cheap and roos voice is different from the other pooh movies. save yourself $15 and skip this marketeting rip off."
1,DEJA VU,"Don't buy this if you already have ""Boo to You"" - over half this movie is Boo to you in a Piglet flashback. My son is watching it for the first time right now and keeps asking for the heffalump back (since that's what he thought he was getting - and so did I!!). How cheap to re-sell the same movie with a new title and a couple new scenes!"
4,I know a good book when I read one.,"Sister Katie is a rare novel. It was written about a time that many black people have forgotten. But while I was reading the book, I found myself glad that the time had passed. Doris Hunt-Jorden captured the essence of that period very well. Another book I enjoyed reading this year is Lunch With Cassie by Janet M. Henderson. It is also about black people and some of their struggles."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This particular DVD is highly recommended. Well made, very educational and informative on all card manipulation tricks which requires a force card! Regardless of your level of expertise you will be able to perform all of these forces within minutes of watching the video."
2,Not So Great Doggie!,"My 2.5 year old is just getting into the Play Doh experience, so I bought her this dog, and I was very dissapointed. In my eyes there is only one cool thing about it. If you put play doh in the dogs head the tongue comes out. It is pretty boring and there is not a whole lot to do with the toy. I was pretty disappointed, and I am not one to complain about things. I guess since it was only 10 dollars I couldn't have expected a lot."
4,Was more fun than expected,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this toy, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were more things to do with the play doh doggy doctor- facilitating creative play- than I had originally realized. My son (6 ys. old) spent a long time playing with it the first few days, and has since not gone back to it. It doesn't provide hours of play equivalent to a game boy or something more exciting, but I know he will get in the mood to play with play- doh again and it will be ready for him for another little while until it goes back on the shelf. Overall pleased."
2,I've seen better,"Did anybody else get the teeth mold with theres? It says on the front and back of box MOLD TEETH how or where do you do that? I found the dog hard to use by a 4 & 5 year old, even thought it says for ages 3+ The head of the dog is constantly falling off and using the syringe is also very hard to push play doh out of. The colors the put in the set were not the best either neon pink, neon green & white. I've contacted Hasbro about the Teeth mold and they wont reply. It says mold many items... bandaids, fleas, socks, slippers,bones, but where's the TEETH?"
2,Disappointed......,"We bought this for our 3 year-old and were disappointed. She still needs help with it over a year and a half later! The head is hard to push down, she can't extract the wax from the ears, the molds are pretty much a joke. Then, when she is done with it, I have to spend 20 minutes getting all of the play-doh out of it, because if it dries up there is a very slim chance of ever getting it out! I gave it 2 stars because the concept is great...she enjoys trying to make the ""doggy better"" but the engineering is in need of improvement."
2,Disappointed,"My 4yr. old daughter wanted this toy more than anyother for christmas. Once she got it and we both played with it, she left it after 15 minutes and it now sits in the corner.The head falls off all the time, there is no place to put the extra pieces of the toy, and the molds are a pain to use.It would be better to buy play-doh alone instead of a ""kit""."
3,The Ad isn't completely True,"The episodes in this DVD set are from the DIC era of the Care Bears not the Nelvana era that did the movies and both versions of the animated series.Some of the episodes WERE released on video a long time ago by a company around 1985 to 87. They came out the same time as the Nelvana episodes were released in larger numbers.The episodes include:Drab City, The Old Man & The Lighthouse, Birthday, Lucky Charm, Night the Stars Went Out, Cloud Worm and Magic Shop.The DIC series featured low quality animation which was common for DIC, however they are the only ones that feature Loyal Heart Dog in a speaking role. If you want to buy the DVD then do so. If it sells enough we might get the better Nelvana episodes that feature No-Heart, Brightheart and others that the DIC episodes ignored."
1,Waste of money,"As a giant fan of the Carebears, I had bought the original 2 Carebears movies, as well as some of the VHS tapes that come with the stuffed animals not too long ago.Seeing this dvd in the store, I was thrilled to find another Carebear movie and of course bought it right away, along with the Last Laugh dvd.They were both a horrible disappointment to me though, and if I could I would have taken them back and gotten my money back! It didnt match up at all to the original Carebears movies and show, and several of the voices were quite awful! Nothing at all compared to the originals!Original Carebears fans will not like this dvd at all.My advice.... do not waste your money on any of the 3 dvd's in this set!"
5,Worked Well,The creme brulee came out perfect. The lift out carrier is a nice feature. Hopefully I can buy additional cups since 4 isn't a lot.
5,Great for Creme Brlée,"This set is perfect, the size is great so I can accommodate 2 sets at once in my oven. The white ramekins are the perfect size for this dessert."
3,Creme Brulee Kit,"I was disappointed with the small size of the ramekins. Perhaps is was in the description but I missed it. Assumed, which is never a good thing, that they were the more standard size."
1,Made in China,Got mine yesterday. box said Made in China. I thought Chicago Metallic was Made in USA...very disappointing to me!
3,No replacement ramekins available,I love the set - works really well - but I broke a ramekin and Chicago Metallic doesn't offer extra ramekins to fit in the wire rack. They are supposed to be 6-oz ramekins and the closest I could find were 6-oz ramekins from HIC - but those just barely do NOT fit in the set's wire rim - so now my set only makes 3 brulees at a time. If you buy this set - don't break any ramekins because as far as I can tell they are not replaceable.
4,More than convenient,"Ordered two sets to make special dinners for four to six people, finishing with creme brulees as a grand finale. Making the brulees is now both easier and safer; no more sliding ramekins or sloshing, scalding hot water. Lifting the ramekins from their hot water baths is a simple, quick motion. I would rate this item with five stars except for the fact that the purchaser should know that while the ceramic ramekins go into the dishwasher, the metal pan and rack should be hand washed and dried immediately, to avoid rusting. Excellent product overall."
3,Super fast shipping but...,"The product arrived in lightening speed and the ramekins are great but the pan rusted on my first time using it. That said I do like the wire tray but it makes the creme brlée have to cook longer. I recommend the product but I recommend you use another 8"" pan besides the one provided."
4,Creme Brulee!!!!,"This is an awesome set! Though if you're buying it, I would suggest buying two! The only complaint I have is that 4 may not be enough if you're entertaining, you have a family of 5, or you like to indulge in quite a bit of deserts. The metal tray makes it much easier to go in/out from the pan, and the pan also doubles as an awesome brownie pan for me. I intend on buying two more 6oz ramekins and just using those to compensate for when I need that little extra."
4,Boo! There's a ghost in your house!,"I'm a big fan of this series. You've got a psychic who talks to dead people and a cop who finds the facts. Together, they give you the history of a haunted house and then they sit down with the homeowners and scare the s**t out of them. It's a nice spin on the paranormal genre.The overall DVD presentation is fairly average, which is why I'm only giving this 4 stars. The video/audio are pretty decent for an SD transfer, but I would much rather have this in HD. Hey Travel Channel, when are we gonna get this on Blu-Ray????"
2,Smokey Green,"I enjoy Numi rose white tea which tastes wonderful. However, the green tea tastes smokey and not very reminiscent of verdant tea leaves. At least the tea is organic and fair trade."
2,Gunpowder Green tea By Numi Tea,"I found this Numi Tea overpriced for it's quality and taste.Just regular twinnings kind of quality tea dust.Elaine Newman, tea drinker"
3,"pretty good, except...",the thing about these wristbands is that you can't really see the purple and red on the rainbow. other than that they're fine.
4,good deal,"it attach to my ATV with no problem, the attach to the plate with no problems ,looks really good thanks"
5,lighting,I found the need to adjust my earlier review............. Evidently I was just being stupid. I will have to chalk this up to crouching on the ground with poor lighting on my first attempt. This bracket mounts quick and easily.
4,MURDER MYSTERY IN SOUTH AFRICA,"Another murder mystery by Author James McClure taking place in 1980, starring his very capable Lt. Kramer and Detective Zondi of South Africa. These ace investigators also appear in other McClure novels. In this story, Mrs.Digby-Smith opens the trunk of her car and discovers a tied-up corpse which eventually the reader learns is that of her younger brother. I found the novel to be a well-plotted and well-written piece and involves some hideous underworld characters, and some unresolved enmities of World War II. The story will keep your attention right to the ironic, surprising end."
3,digital computer electronics,"I want a copy of this reviewer, addressing modes, editor and compiler by Albert Paul Malvino"
1,Horrible CD,"This is by far one of the WORST trance cd's i've ever heard. All the DJ crack songs are just so freaking stupid. And the dolphin song? what the heck is that!? lol. It doesn't take a lot to impress me when it comes to trance but this cd takes the cake for some of the most horrible songs i've ever heard. I have NO CLUE how people could rate this junk 5 stars. maybe they're new trance listeners or someone who doesn't know what real trance is suppose to sound like. This cd has a TON of dumb voice overs that just make the cd even more horrible. It's amazing that people like this cd, people will give good ratings no matter how much they think a song sucks. It's like they MAKE themselves like it and then tell their friends its a good song. If you give this cd even more then 2 stars just do me a favor and punch yourself in the mouth."
3,"Could be SO much better, with one major change","The CD is marred by the stupid voice-over ""singing."" The music has power and dignity, but the repetitive injected words (e.g., ""we have lift-off"") are generally quite distracting to me, the listener. There is good techno singing and there is bad; most of this is pretty bad.Otherwise pretty good."
4,Great collection!,"I am a huge fan of ""Perdido Street Station"" and ""The Scar."" I didn't really care for ""Iron Council,"" although it was still better than 99% of the fantasy published that year. I enjoyed all of the stories in ""Looking for Jake,"" but two knocked me off my feet and had me scrambling to order the UK hardcover edition: ""Familiar"" and ""Jack.""""Familiar"" is the story of a hedge wizard's attempt at creating a familiar, and how it evolves when left to its own devices. This is one of the darkest and most enjoyable short stories I've read in a long time and is my pick for story of the year!""Jack"" is a short tale concerning Jack Half-a-Prayer, and is a glorious return to form for Mieville. It is set in New Crobuzon, and if you liked the first couple of Bas Lag books, this story is essential.Overall, a strong collection. I would have given it 5 stars, but really wanted to see more Bas Lag material. Maybe next collection..."
4,China Miéville's book of short stories,"China Miéville is a novelist, that's where he really shines. The novel form gives him the room he needs to develop his ideas and evoke the sort of bizarre, surreal, often grotesque milieu (often just a sideways step or a blink of the eye away from reality) at which he so excels.The short story form doesn't really give him the room he needs to work his magic. Oh, this book does have its moments, definitely. One story in it is even in the New Crobuzon universe of some of his most successful novels and gives a bit of backstory to one of the legendary characters in those books. However, on the whole the short stories are not quite up to the quality of his novels. They're just a bit lacking in depth.On the other hand, if you've already read all his novels or are looking for a book of short weird fiction, by all means pick this one up."
2,Surprisingly Awful,"China Mieville's novels are intoxicatingly well written, so I jumped at the chance to read some of his short fiction as well. It was, as the rating suggests, seriously disappointing. Almost all of the stories lack Mieville's characteristic voice and he seems to be fundamentally perplexed by the short fiction form - all but perhaps one or two of the stories lack the ""punch"" that I expect when reading short fiction. Steer clear unless it's just out of morbid curiosity; your time would be far better spent rereading The Scar or Perdido Street Station."
3,It's okay..,I bought this for my newborn son. It's not as good material as I thought it would be. It's very very thin and feels cheap. It's still cute though!
1,cheap material!,"This is a really REALLY cheap product! If I didn't wash it, i would definitely return it.Also, the size is pretty small compared to other hooded towels."
1,terrible...just terrible...,"this has to be the most pathetic attempt at a childrens book ive ever seen! after seeing this book at the store i was curious to read it, so i did. talk about a writer with no talent! kids these days shouldnt be reading books that have the word fart on every page. they should be reading books that get their imaginations going, like harold and the purple crayon or where the wild things are. kids should be able to be creative and always learning and not going around saying ""hyuk hyuk...fart..."""
5,Fart On!,These are really cute books with a lot of appeal for preschoolers and young school-age children. Walter is a hero who uses his farting handicap for the good of all.
5,walter at the yard sale,"Walter the farting dog, I was appalled when I first saw a book about a farting dog, but once I read it i had to by it."
1,Walter the Farting Dog,"I seriously enjoy this series of books. Walter is an underdog in every sense of the word, yet his children love him. The series is a wonderful example of tolerance and love. Yet this book is a hard cover edition of Walter at the Yard Sale. NOT a new book in the series. I bought it and was seriously disappointed that is was an old book with a different title."
4,Funny Story for a Kid's Favorite Topic,"This series of books is the perfect choice for little ones who have become easily entertained by everything ""farting""..it seems to strike a cord with my 3-year old, who finds farting and the sound of the word endlessly funny!!"
5,Walter saves the day!,"This book about a dog who farts too much is funny because he uses his farting to help people. He is accepted by his family even though he farts. In the end, he saves the day because he is a farter."
1,The worst kids book ever,"I also can't believe this book was published. It is the worst children's book ever. I would've given zero stars, if it were possible. While I agree that a book about a farting dog might be funny to kids, especially boys, this one is not remotely funny. Also teaches kids poor lessons about selling your family dog because he smells bad. My kids were given a copy of this book but I tossed it in my recycle bin. It's such a horrible book, I wouldn't even give it away."
1,HORRIBLE book for children,"I bought this book for my 3 year old son, thinking he would get a kick out of the farting dog. Well the father in this story sells Walter the dog and lies to his children about it. Walter is then used in a plot to rob a bank. It is just bad from beginning to end-not funny, just sad. Worst children's book I have ever purchased!"
2,Didn't hold my interest like the first one did.,"Walter is back but not with the same enthusiasm as the first book. I barely laughed at this book and was disappointed because I absolutely fell in love with William Kotzwinkle's original Farting Dog book. Same strange, yet intriguing illustrations but the story didn't hold my interest."
3,Walter the Farting Dog,"Although its a one joke book, this is a cute concept with clever writing. However, my six year old, who can tolerate Harry Potter and other scary subjects, was frightened by the very depressed looking dog and the cruel father. It seems the artistic style of the illustrations did not keep up with the light hearted tone of the book."
5,walter save the day kef,First Walter said that I am apart of the family then the man said I will give you 10.00 dollars. The man made walter fart and blow up balloons.
1,Don't buy,"I bought this book for my kids. My husband and I, as well as my family think it is stupid and it has been thrown in the trash."
1,Worst Book Ever,This was the absolute worst book I have ever read to my child. I would have never bought this book if I had known how awful it really was!
5,walter the farting dog: trouble at the yard sale,It is a wonderful book for the boys and helps them learn to love to read and I found the book refreshing and absolutely funny!! Hands down!!
1,I can't believe this was published,"My professor in my Teaching With Children's Books class read us this book as an example of ""make sure you read a book yourself before you read it to kids because it might not be what you thought."" While I spent the whole time laughing until I almost cried, it was because the book was just so awful that I can't believe it was ever published. The story was just so insane that I had to share it with my friends. I told them all about it. If these are supposed to have a moral, no one got it because they were so busy laughing at the farting and the fart catching machine.This book might be so hilariously bad that I enjoyed hearing it. Still, I have to say I would never read this to a child. I have a hard time believing that this book is as acclaimed as the back of it claims to be."
1,Offensive,"I bought this book for a good friend's of mine child without seeing the book. It is not appropriate for children. Though it looks like a fun, funny, cartoon book for kids, it is not and not something I would read to my children."
1,slow delivery,"The book is fine, although it was in paperback, which I was unaware of when I ordered it. It did take over 3 weeks to deliver it, and it was folded in a soft manila envelope, which left a crease in the middle of the book. Poor delivery time and poor packaging led to an undesirable experience."
1,A Morally Deficient Book,"This book is so bad that for the first time in my life I had to physically destroy and throw the book away. I couldn't even bring myself to throw it in the trash whole and risk someone finding it and reading it to their children. What a morally deficient author to write a book where the father, sells his children beloved pet because he hates the dog and then lies about it to the kids telling them he is just wandering around and will be back soon. And at the end fakes love for the dog for the press and cameras!I am also shocked that there are parents out there that actually heap kudos on this kind of junk (just because their 4 year old liked it and laughed at it!) and can't see that they are teaching their kids to be immoral!Shame."
2,Loses the first book.s sweet spirit,"From the moment Dad sells Walter at the garage sale without so much as a second thought, this book heads down the wrong path. It does not have the goofy sweet spirit of the first book. The kids I read it to were really upset that not only Dad sold the dog, but he lies without even a blink. Boo Hiss!"
