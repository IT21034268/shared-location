2,Garden the old fashioned way,"Got the garden as a Christmas gift. Followed directions as instructed and two of the four molded out. I will garden the old fashioned way, with real dirt. At least the pots are good for something. Also, it would be much cheaper to just by pots, seeds and dirt than to spend more than $20 for this ."
4,works,"It's been three weeks and my basil, chives, italian parsley and thyme have sprouted and are doing well I think, you can plant your own seeds by the way."
1,Chia failure,"I gave this product as a gift to my cooking-enthusiast daughter who was delighted to grow her own fresh herbs. This product was a train wreck. After carefully following the directions only one plant sprouted and it soon died. Perhaps the prodict was old or not properly handeled, I don't know. Don't waste your money."
2,Just buy plants,"I don't know if it's just me, but the seeds never really turned into plants and I wasn't able to use any of the herbs for cooking or anything."
2,it was very old,i received the item as described but i think it was 2 old the seeds might have been expired because i followed the directions exactly and nothing has happened im not gonna buy another and i would suggest going 2 your local greenhouse and buying fresh starter pants
1,"Did not work at all, very disappointed","This is the first product I've ever felt the need to write a review for, and it's not for a good reason.I bought this kit a few months ago, followed instructions to the letter, got the pots enough water and sun. And now, the basil is maybe 2 inches high (showing no signs of growing bigger), and the cilantro and parsley were basically D.O.A.Extremely disappointed with this product..."
1,Chia Herb Garden,Should be called the Chia Herbless Garden. This item was very disapointing. Got ONE sprout. No recomendation here. Followed directions to a T.
2,Inadequate,"I received an extra packet of dill seeds, and no parsley seeds. This is a shame, since parsley was one of my first choices to grow, and dill was my last choice.The chives seeds never sprouted, and I ended up reseeding that pot with marjoram which only contained ten or fifteen of the fifty seeds the pack was supposed to contain.The cilantro didn't sprout until I shoved the seeds into the ""growing medium,"" but they're now growing better than the basil (potential cilantro cultivators take note).The growing medium consists of sponges composed primarily of soil. Only one of the three actually fit properly, and one was even crumbling and missing parts of its top - making for an uneven growing surface. I suspect that the primary result of using these sponges will not be the advertised ease of repotting, but root-bound plants that can't be separated.The pots are well-made, but the saucers only hold enough extra water to get through about 12 hours.Buyers; be aware."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this item for my daughter as she loves fresh herbs when cooking. I figured it would be an easy thing to grow indoors as stated on the box. Wrong! First of all the box stated that it contained 4 different herbs. When she opened the box, there were 2 different herbs. There were 4 packages of seeds but only 2 different herbs. She followed the instructions to the letter and waited for sprouting to begin. Well, they sprouts came and then they died. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Chia should stay with Chia Heads and leave the herb growing to someone else. Needless to say, I've gone to Wal-mart and purchased seeds and dirt and my herbs are thriving!"
1,Mold mold mold,"I fondly remembered having one of these years ago. So as I set up my new apartment I thought it would be a fun way to have easy access to a few herbs for cooking. However, once I set it up and the mold covered the sponges I recalled (not so fondly) the same thing happened with my old chia garden. I did use a mixed solution of hydrogen peroxide and water per the instructions, we'll see if it works. Either way if Chia processed the sponges more carefully mold wouldn't be an issue. I'd advise getting some small pots, seeds, and soil at Home Depot instead."
1,Huge rip off,"This was the biggest rip off. Unless you are standing right beside these plants to water them constantly, you are not going to get anything. Some of the herbs didn't even grow, the ones that did were so weak they couldn't survive. The pots are cute so maybe we can use them for something else."
4,Chia is cute,"I ordered multiple sets to give as gifts. They arrived on time and had everything needed to get started. They are now growing like crazy except the chives. I have replanted twice. Pots are tiny, but do the job of getting herbs started. Great in a south facing window which is in my kitchen. They do need constant, daily water."
3,Nice pots but 3 out of 4 plants didn't grow,"I gave this product 3 stars because the pots are nice and everything was packaged nicely and the book is very informative, but most of my seeds never sprouted. I read the booklet that came with the kit and carefully followed the directions. I checked the water every day and did exactly what it said. However, after 4 weeks, still only my cilantro had sprouted and even that doesn't have too many sprouts considering the number of seeds there were. Since you get 6 seed packets and only 4 pots, I'll try planting the other 2 next with dirt to see if I have better luck that way instead of with the sponges provided."
1,Waste of Money,"I got this for Christmas last year. I suggest you do not waste your money. I did everything the instructions said to do. It had enough water, enough light everything and they did not grow like they where supposed to. I called and complained. They sent me more seed packs and more sponges. This time I planted them in regular dirt in a pot outside during summer. Same thing enough light enough water. Still would not grow properly or big enough to use like they show on TV. Do not waste your money!"
2,False Advertising,"So, I bought two of these as gifts. It turns out it comes with 3 pots and soil sponges, not 4 as advertised. The seeds have not yet been planted, so I can't say how well it works, but the false advertising is dissapointing. If you buy this, just know that the description is misleading."
2,Disappointing,"This product is not all it claims to be, I usually have no problems growing anything indoors or out, but I could not get one (1) of the six (6) seed packets I planted to grow to maturity in the special ""chia soil"". While all six herbs sprouted, none had the strength to grow properly despite reading and following the ""detailed"" directions to the letter. I can't recommend this product as a result."
1,Did not even sprout,I have grown herbs in regular pots and plain soil before without issue. The chia herb garden did not even sprout! I followed directions. Highly disappointed and would never buy this again. Will stick to buying herbs like basil and mint from local nurseries--it's cheaper and less work.
2,This didn't work at all for me,Maybe I just wasn't doing it right but this didn't work for me at all. The growth was pitiful and I just couldn't keep them alive. The picture makes it look like there is this rich and thick growth and all I got was straggly slivers of growth. I'm throwing it away.
2,Worthless drill,"The cordless drill has NEVER worked and I don't have the time to call the company or replace it. The rest of the tools are adequate - it is a nice kit, but pretty worthless without the cordless drill.."
3,Great cases...,"The quality of the bits leave a little bit to desire. However, the cases in which they come in are very nice and the bag is sturdy and assembled well. The bag allows my existing bits to be added and I have replaced some of the bits with better existing bits I already had. For the every day worker the bits would not work, but for the weekend warrior it is a nice package."
2,its ok,dont expect the best here you get what you pay for.this set is ok but be careful the drill bits break very easily
4,Great Deal at 19.99,"... and i paid 27.99 a few months ago... and i'm still happy... You really do get more than you pay for with this set, in my opinion. These really are decent bits... not the most expensive quality, but genuinely tough decent drill bits.. i've broken only one... and i beat up my bits (perhaps because my craftsman skills could be better). The carrying cases are very nice and compact, perfect organizational wise... like good fly boxes, if you fly fish. the outer carry-all case is kind of cheap i don't use it... but i suppose functional. 4+ stars.. 5 stars are for truly perfect items... these are just short."
1,Seems nice online...,"I like the bag, but the rest of the tools are cheap, chinese made crap. Not worth $40. I will be returning it."
2,"Bag worth more than the tools, mostly","I have to say that the Denali tool bags are more appealing than the tools in many regards. Specifically, the few driver bits I used snapped or tweaked almost immediately; however, the plastic cases that hold the various bits and such as well as the bag itself makes up for the cruddy quality of the metal used to make the tools -- go figure. I'd actually consider buying Denali bagged tool sets again, if only for the bag. Maybe they should scrap tool making and just sell bags.Also, this set came with a material disclaimer note which I think pertained to the apparently toxic resin used to make the plastic case - Ha! These effers get ya comin' and goin' and you'll probably get cancer after the encounter. Gotta love it"
4,Great Product,I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. It arrived in no time. I bought the cordless screwdriver and the accessory kit and they were top quality. Thanks.
2,Muy bueno al principio,"Al llegar estaba muy contento, compre el taladro denali con todo el pack completo... lo use bastante, la bateria dejo de funcionar a los dos meses y las mechas se me oxidaron horrible al igual que los punteros...Para resolver una situacion rapida, funciona... a largo plazo, olvidalo."
1,Great until the Driver Bits break,"In general, this pack is a GREAT deal...Until you find all of the driver bits start breaking. It's not like they were getting sheared off from poor fit - the tips would literally break right off into the screw head. This is a HUGE pain, since it's nearly impossible to remove a long screw that has the head filled with a bit. At least 5 bit heads have broken off inside of screws --- *and that's absolutely unacceptable to me*"
4,great set of bits,"Haven't had a chance to use all the different types of bits, but so far so good. My only complaint is that there's no way to differentiate between the different bits based on the storage containers. I find myself having to open each one and see what's inside to find the bit I want. I wish they had labelled them for me, but I guess I could just do it myself too. All in all, I thought this was a good buy. The bag it comes in is heavy duty and should last a long time."
3,"Buy it for the Bag & Cases, not the bits","I agree with most of the reviewers...the bag and cases [1 wide-mouth reinforced bag w/heavy-duty zipper and 4 solid plastic cases that lock shut securely with sliding latches and hold bits on either side] are what make this worth buying...the bits themselves appear to be of typical China-made quality, which is what I expected for the price anyway. However, I can put my Milwaukee and Freud bits in the bag as well and just toss the bag in the truck when I have a job to do."
4,very good,"This is a very good rock CD. If you like rock music this is definetly for you. Also recomended, New Radicals Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too"
2,Doesn't stay in place,"I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute. However, when I got it and put it on my ear and tried using it, I quickly discovered that if you move your head at all, the head set falls away from your ear and nearly falls completely off. Unlike most headsets, no part of this one actually goes in your ear, so it isn't very securely in place. Overall, it will work for what I needed it for which is talking on the phone while driving. Shipping was very quick, I received it days before I was expecting to, however, I am disappointed with the headset."
5,Excellent Product,I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves using this product. This device offers hand-free communication with the use of a phone that has bluetooth. Product was nicely wrapped and included everything described.
5,onion soup bowls,These were purchased for a Christmas gift so they have not yet been given and used. They do look lovely and I was pleeased with the smoothness of the transaction.
5,you know its a great toy when you repeatedly replace the batteries,"my kids love it, from 5 to 12yrs old. great, lasts a long time, not that expensive, get it now."
3,Just OK,Thought it would be a little better. It works as described and recording your own sounds makes it a little more fun than a regular giggle stick.
2,Zen V Plus accessorie kit review,The skin cover fits wellThe retractable USB Data Sync cable does not work well but the travel charger works fineOverall I wasn't to happy with the accessorie kit .
4,Good,Exactly as orderednubby Nyah h ynhnh. Huh a. Ann sauna Jane hand at viva nouns junta n using Khg
2,Only fair,This book is way too over priced for the technical level of information it contains. Mostly basic stuff. If you're just starting out and it was 1/3 the price I would say get it. But as it's priced it is too basic for even mid level technicians. There are many other books out there that have a wealth more information for alot less money.
2,extremely short and disappointing,"I bought this dvd for my daughter, not knowing that it is a mini-dvd. The story is ok, but not worth $6.98. Amazon should have a separate category for the mini-dvd. Nowhere in the description is it mentioned and I had no way of knowing until the product actually showed up"
5,"HELLO KITTY & FRIENDS, VOL. 1","LOVE THE MAGICIAN ASPECT OF THIS. IT'S CUTE. AS ALWAYS, MY SERVICE WAS PERFECT AS WELL!"
5,GREAT Book !,I actually knew the author. He was a very nice man. I bought this book as a gift for a friend. Her father worked with the author. She was REALLY excited about getting it ! I understand she read it within a week of receiving it. VERY exciting to get it for her !
3,Not Sure about the Purity,"Comparing this to the left-overs I had from another brand, this one is not as white as the other, and has a bit of salty/sour taste, while the other one is nearly tasteless. The difference is small but noticeable. I suspect that this may be indicative that this product may not be as pure as this other brand. This product doesn't say 100% pure on its label. If you want 100% pure and tasteless and don't mind spend a bit more, you'd probably want to look for a brand that explicitly states 100% pure."
5,good stuff,"good value, seems to taste less bitter than the other brands i've used, and it mixes more easily, too!"
3,Beautiful costumes. Artistic fighting scenes. Good acting of the main female actor. Confusing plot and ending.,The costumes are beautiful. The fighting scenes are artistic and attractive. The acting of the main female actor is convincing. However the plot and ending are confusing. The ending does not make sense.It's still worth watching once. I prefer House of Flying Daggers.
2,GREAT VISUALS,"THE STORY IS REALLY LAME, THE FIGHT SCENES ARE NOT THAT GREAT, BUT THE COLORS, THE PICTURE AND VISUALS ARE REALLY GREAT, SO IT ONLY GETS 2 STARS!!!"
2,The Black Scorpian,"This is the Chinese version of Hamlet.nothing new except it is the protagonist is the stepmother. This version of the role of Gertrude is a younger (younger than hamlet even) step mother and not his mother who is the pivotal point of the action.We all know that imperial famlies from the pharohs to the shoguns to the hapsburgs were messed up, but the whole premiss that the empress was courted first by her stepson then married her brother-in-law due to politcal pressure, but stilled tried too manuver her stepson into power is a bit of a reach.In all as an artistic endevor it was great, but as a story ""Fantasy Mission Force"" was a far better picture."
3,BUENA PELÍCULA,"AUNQUE ESPERABA ALGO MÁS, ESTA ES UNA BUENA PELÍCULA.LAS ACTUACIONES SON ALGO EXAGERADAS. ME DABA LA SENSACIÓN EN ALGUNAS OCACIONES DE QUE ESTABA VIENDO UNA OBRA TEATRAL. NI SIQUIERA LA HERMOSA ZHANG ZIYI SALVA ESTE RUBRO.EXCELENTES LA FOTOGRAFIA, EL VESTUARIO Y LA AMBIENTACIÓN.LA TRAMA ES BUENA AUNQUE ALGO LENTA. MUY POCAS ESCENAS DE PELEA.PARA LOS FANÁTICOS DEL GÉNERO SE LAS PUEDO RECOMENDAR."
2,legend of the black scorpion,I bought Legend of The Black Scorpion and to my surprise I found out that its the same film of Banquet.Please dont advertise them as different dvd becuase they are the same. I bought Banquet a month ago.now I have two copies of the same film. The posters and title are diffrent but the films the same.Many thanks
2,Why does this movie gets more than 2 stars? Why?,"I actually read all the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie before i bought it and i literally just finish watching and i can't imagine why this movie is being reviewed so well. There is absolutely nothing special about the action or the story. It was actually extremely typical, in the first 10-20 minutes you will know exactly how this movie was going to end. Its not a bad movie but its definitely not good or great, it's just Average."
3,Hmm...,"This movie is visually pleasing with a good storyline, with lots of drama and intrigue? Why only three stars? Well, I found the ending (the VERY ending) to be disappointing and confusing. I would have liked it better if the closing scene was done in a different way or eliminated all together because it was confusing with what happened to Wan. However, the rest of the film was well-done, so even with the ending scene, I still recommend this movie."
3,good,This products works well with more expensive phones like the Smart Phones. My phone isn't as fancy so it works ok. I did have to have it professionally installed in my 2007 Toyota Tundra.
1,Not compatible with iPhone,"DOes not allow voice dialing with iPhone and, as many other reviewers mentioned, does not ""play well"" with the iPhone."
1,Stay clear of this one,"I bought this through Amazon two weeks ago, I finally had a Saturday off to install it and found it was defective. It would not go into pairing mode. I called Motorola's USA tech support only to get India and a guy reading the manual getting famillar on my dime. After 1 and half hours of indian dialect he tells me that I have to send it back at my expense so they can evaluate it. I tell him this wont do. I calle Amazon and they tell me to call Motorola. This is the last Motorola product I buy and maybe the last time I shop via Amazon. At least if I bought local I could be talking to an american and not some indian. Do yourself a favor dont buy this product."
4,Overall really good so far,"I installed it on my jeep today. So far it is really good. It is quite loud and people can't tell that they are on speaker phone. I have no problems with vehicle noise interfering with my calls. Other people with smaller, quieter cars complained of problems with noise but I don't have that problem and I drive a really loud car. My only complaint is that the double sided tape that came with it to mount the control panel and the mic really sucks. They both fell off within hours of the install. I solved it by using some other double sided tape I had so it wasn't a big deal. The install was really easy for me. If you know your way around cars and your car's wiring its really easy to install...otherwise have someone else do it."
3,Second unit works fine...,First unit delivered worked normally for 6 days then went dead. Replugging its power cable brought it back to life: just like a cat it happened 9 times and then I sent unit back for replacement. Second unit has been in two weeks and works fine. My recommendations? Good unit but SAVE ALL RECIEPTS - you may need them again...
4,Motorola HF850,"We installed these kits in 3 of our service trucks for use with Motorola i580's. The kits are simple to install, easy to link with the phone and work very well, even in our louder diesel trucks. I especially like the feature that mutes the radio automatically when you make or receive a call."
1,FDA issued warning not to use for children under 2 years old,"Since my baby is teething, the first thing that came to my mind is she needs baby orajel. However, I was reading online that the FDA issued a warning in 2011 that it can cause a baby to stop breathing. This is because it can cause increased concentrations of methemoglobinemia which is similar to hemoglobin except that it doesn't have the oxygen carrying capacity that hemoglobin has. Therefore, depriving your baby of oxygen. I used this for my son in 2009, and he was okay with it. However, because of the warning, I'm not risking it with my daughter."
3,Felt Very Pretentious,"I tried hard to get into this but the writing and storyline are dense - I just wasn't getting any enjoyment out of it at all. And therein was likely the problem - it felt either pretentious or more like an overindulgent male fantasy. I'm all for female empowerment - and certainly the women in the book know how to make the best of their situations in a world of men. But right at the first four pages, when our protagonist is wearing a chain mail bikini, the author/artist lost all my respect. Chausses are NOT garter belts.As previous reviewers have noted, there is a LOT of graphic 'fan service' in here. Yes, Artesia is liberted - we get it. Certainly we don't need 6 pages of group sex to make the point. But hey, at least the dialog finally abated a bit then.Honestly, a story can be more effective with restraint. Both in the lumbering endless dialogs and in the very busy art panels. Artesia just feels like it is trying to hard to be high brow and original."
3,Flimsy mechanism,"Only half of the bridge opens for me. The internal gears are pretty flimsy, so they slip and one side only raises halfway."
2,"Poor design, poor construction","I'm big fan of the Thomas wooden railway series, which is why I was surprised that this bridge is so poorly designed and constructed. I had to disassemble and pry apart the bridge to put the green plastic bits in the right alignment so that the bridge would raise and lower. The connector holes aren't cut out well so you have jam the track pieces into it. It's also a hole on each side of the four connectors, no tabs, so you have to use the adapters instead of being able to just slot it inline."
4,Good autobiogaphical book,"I am a Dino fan and have been in his performances, bought his music for years and have even had coffee and cake with him in his Branson business 24Karet Cake company. His book was revealing concerning his early life and the bumpy road to personal success."
5,Very Good Book,"This helps you to get to know Dino better; it's pretty detailed, upfront and honest. I met him at his bakery in Hollister; a little hug, real sweet man.His carrot cake is so amazing you'll never beat the flavor but at sixtyfive I broke out in pimples. So it must be Loaded with some sort of oil.Thinking of reading it again."
1,Is there music worse than this?,"The answer is yes. There is. It's the hip-hop/rap they play on those pop radio-stations and on MTV. It's those corporate sell-outs with millions of dollars and absolutely no skill at all.But as far as underground hip-hop goes, there is no worse music than this. This album is really degrading to women.Seriously. It makes suburban white women look really stupid.And it certainly degrades the entire underground hip-hop/rap community."
1,pure novelty,"Has anyone noticed most people who give this 5 stars usually start their review w/ ""I'm normally not into hip hop but..."". Thats because this isn't hip hop, not even close. Sorry Northern State, but this CD is garbage, find another genre to ruin."
3,They Have Potential,"I use to be a big hip-hop fan, and when I first heard about this group I was very jaded. Hip Hop for me has been going down hill for the last 5 years. And when I listened to this album, I thought it was horrible. But I took a second listen, and it wasn't that bad. They're lyrics and rhyming need much work but, they're ambitious I like that. Also There style is very much reminiscent of some early Beastie Boys work. Most of all they are different from all other hip hop acts out there. Which will defiantly get them notice (I should know I work in the music industry). Good Luck Girls."
2,WAY overrated,"I like hip-hop, and love girl groups so I should be big fans of these guys. I thought they would be like Sleater Kinney doing rap... In fact, I was very disappointed.This is 80s-era beastie boys rap done by women. The beats and delivery and mediocre to bad, and the lyrics are insipid. There is no real content -- all the songs are about how 'bad' they are with some pseudo intellectual references thrown in."
1,Please Do Not Support Them,"This group and their album are disrespectful to the hip hop culture. Not because they are white, not because they are females, but because they have no skills, weak production, and do not deserve props for anything they do. Hip hop is a culture that many people take seriously... this group mocks that culture and treats rap music as a joke."
1,Rap Poison,"How can these three girls with absolutely no talent and no looks become popular? I checked them out after reading a newspaper article about them, and they sound like other four white Spice Girls trying to be black.To that guy who said this CD isnt the atrocity that people say it is, it isn't, it's so much worse. They carry the same tired beat in every song and their lyrics are the worst I have ever heard. The worst thing about them is that when they try to sing they sound worse than when they rap!!! Buy this album if you want a good joke."
1,It finally happened...,"I can now die happy knowing that i've have heard the worst CD ever created. This disc is pretentious, boring, moronic, preachy and insulting all at the same time. I've heard gasses leak out of orifices that has had more artistic merit than this album."
3,strong second offering,"After hearing Norhtern State hyped in various publications as the queens of rap to be I decided to go out and by the record myself. And I have to say if was eight dollars well spent. These three girls deserve most of the hype they've been blessed (or cursed) with. Granted some of the beats are a little weak and a few rhymes left a sour feeling in my ears, but they have skills. All the people writing the ill reviews need to realize this is a ""mini-album"" produced by a small record label (star time). Northern State will have much better facilities and staff when they record their first major label debut with Columbia Records. Which will probably produce more sound and kick ... tracks. This is a group to watch for in the future."
1,"Wow...just awful. Frankly, inexcusable.","... ...this is rap at its absolute worst, and in this age of complete lack-of-talent and focused consumerism in the genre, that's saying quite a bit. Is there some sort of computer based rhyme-generator out there that these girls used to write their songs? They write rhymes that are [not good]. They can't rap. They need a slap. I need a nap. Holy moley, ..., there's a new lyric for your sophomore album, royalty free! It's all yours, my gift to you!In all seriousness, don't believe any ""buzz"" you hear about this album, if you legitimately like good rhymes and fresh lyrics, this is not going to take you anywhere but backward. If you want ""alt-rap"", try The Roots, or RZA's side projects."
4,I love Mary,Mary is the greatest Icon we have and the most devote mother that was ever born into this dismal world that we live in today and have always lived in throughout history. This is an interesting book.
2,Christ's Mother & Ours,"Being a non-Catholic who is becoming more and more interested in the Catholic Church, I have been reading all I can find on the subjects that need to be explained to me about the Catholic Faith. I looked forward to reading this book because all my life I believed that Catholics pray to Mary and consider Mary essential to salvation. I wanted to be convinced of Mary's importance. This book falls far short of that goal. The author at times even seems to be very hostile to non-catholic thought. After reading the book, I almost stopped my inquiry into the Church. Thank goodness I came across another book that cleared up the problems. In short, I would not recommend this book for anyone other than confirmed Catholics, definately not anyone considering becoming a Catholic convert."
1,No flavor,"These have the same great consistency as Twizzlers Nibs, but they have very little flavor. As someone who eats sugar-free products often, I don't mind even the fake sweet taste, but these really are just completely lacking in flavor and sweetness."
5,excellent,"just don't eat too many...as is the case with any sugar free candy! ;)great taste and consistency (tastes/feels like ""the real thing"")..."
2,shipping delay,it's been over 48 hours (more than 2 full business days) since i placed the order and just received an email from amazon that this item is shipped today. after placing my order i read reviews from others complaining about the same issue with this seller (box wave) and also noticed the shipping charge through amazon is more expensive than buying directly from the seller's website. item price is the same. very slow in shipping and no tracking # or any other shipment information is provided. i can't comment on the product itself yet as i have not received it.
1,stickers won't come off the clear screen defeating the whole purpose of it,I was very disappointed in the quality of this item and had to throw all of it out since the stickers/tags wouldn't come off without leaving the paper film on the protector. After struggling through at least 2 attempts I gave up. Very unhappy with the quality and won't purchase it again - wasted time and money.
2,The Most Unoriginal Singer of the Year,"Paulina Rubio is not known for the most creative of lyrics, even in her Spanish albums. So when I heard she was crossing over, I did not expect anything groundbreaking (or even Shakira-esque). The video is a direct copy of Willa Ford's ""I Wanna Be Bad"" and the song sounds like a funked-up, techno'd out cover of something from the eighties.Paulina mostly tries to be Jennifer Lopez, but the urban qualities that made Jennifer a success make Paulina's attempt laughable. I like her well enough, but Paulina needs to find a true sense of herself in her life and her music.It's an okay dance track, but this woman's career needs quite a bit of work."
3,Harlem: The making of a Ghetto: Negro New York 1890-1930,"The reading was not about what I thought it would be. I thought it was going to go into the jazz age, but otherwise not bad. It gave a brief history of the early years of how Harlem got to be. What an irony that Harlem wasn't always a ghetto, it was a whealthy neighborhood. Jews and Italians used to live there back in the 1800's and early nineteenth century. How it has change over the years, comparing it to the way it is now, I don't think it has change much in it's ecomomic situation, and also in it's crime and vice. Harlem was where the rich and well to do had their mansions and estates. I went to school in Harlem and I remember I believe it was Hamiltons house there in 143 street and convent ave. They have moved it some where else very few of these historical landmarks are still around New York today."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I'd give it 5 stars if it had the threaded arbor. I don't get why some do and some don't have this option, I guess cost.Anyways, this is a flap disc, not much to say.I'm sure these higher-end named brand discs will outlast cheapies but it's too early to tell for me.Overall a good product."
4,Preparing Tester,I bought this to help me study for the ABO test. The formulas are very indept and lots of practice questions. It is a great book if you are looking to get certified. It has helped me a lot and it makes it easier to learn because it does break it down step by step and explains it all. Highly Recommended!!!
1,NO WAY,"I bought this book to study for my ABOC. I didn't get very far, lets just say that.If you peruse[...] website, you'll be able to find the link to a page with far more helpful study materials. BTW: Just a few tips about the abo:Study common eye diseases and conditionsHow Prism worksFocal length equationsnames of tools and lensometer parts. (I got a 91. YAY) Good luck!I found the downloadable ABO Practice exam VERY helpful:[...]Also"
3,Exellent for reference but may be over most people's heads,"I bought this a year or two ago in preparing for my ABO certification, so I could have a reference for various formulas i would need to memorize (prism by decentration, total lens power, vertex power, etc).. Wow.. I got so much more.. yet much of it was over my head, and looked like a foreign language to me (a background in higher math like calculus is required, as it suggests in the book).. Stuff I would never need, much less actually use as an Optician.. This book is more fitting the lines of a career in Optical Engineering... Very good book though, packed with formulas to figure just about anything you could need about light and how to refract it."
3,Book Synopsis,"Publisher: HarlequinPublication Date: 1/1/1992Book Description:The Way of the WarriorJamie MacDonald's was a loner - and a dangerous task - to unite the feuding Highland clans against a traitor's conspiracy. His desperate search for allies led him to Clan Gordon and. against his better judgment, into the arms of Lindsey Gordon, proud, willful daughter of that noble house.Lindsey knew too well the fearsome reputation of the red-bearded giant they called the Heartless MacDonald, and she cared little for his rough ways. Yet, even as she struggled In his unwelcome embrace, she longed for the noble heart that this warrior concealed so well ..."
4,the text and photographs are skillfully integrated; tops,"If you can visualize the swing you want, this is one of the best texts to help you check its correctness and then make it happen. It is not a miracle worker (no text is) but the photos and text work well together to enable you to translate the mental image to golf action."
3,Not Fred Couples Total Shotmaking,"I think this would have gotten a 5 star review if he were fred couples, because fred couples is the man. If you want a real book, look into fred couples total shotmaking."
3,it was ok,"i bought this book years ago to research some stuff. i think it was pretty helpful, and the price was right. i am sure i didnt pay $17 though"
2,No Readi-Lead,"My only problem with this is that there aren't any designs (clings) ready to paint like Gallery Glass has.Should AT LEAST come with lead strips which is fun, but time consuming.I personally CAN'T do the liquid leading freehanded.This company should send the book WITH the supplies to do the project.CG"
1,Fuzzy is the word,"MP503B looks ugly, but that ain't its worst virtue. Image is totally fuzzy, and viewing angle is pathetic compared to most other LCDs. When I try to adjust brightness or contrast, very little change. Not a good choice by any standard. I should have opted for a Viewsonic."
2,Not up to reviews,"I bought spreader off great reviews, disappointed in performance. Spreader control not adjusted properly to allow full closure, precision measurement slides out of setting, and difficult to push when fully loaded. Good price, however cheaper Scott's brand worked better."
4,very good item,only thing is that when it came the top lip was cracked. i recommend this item. i did not need to return because the corner top was only cracked not where the pellets sit or else it is a great item. i use it for my ice melting pellots.
5,Least Expensive Pneumatic Tire Broadcast Spreader,"If your yard has even the slightest deviations from total flatness -- pneumatic tires make a world of difference. They maintain contact, continue spinning, and ensure even distribution of your seed/fertilizer. This is the least expensive pneumatic tire spreader I could locate and it works great -- no issues at all. Setup took two minutes and it was off to the races. They include a calibration guide which listed spread settings for all major brands of seed and fertilizer. Handy. Recommended."
1,Major design problems and not worth the money!,I have had this spreader for one and a half years and I have had nothing but problems with it from the first time I used it. The biggest problem is that fertilizer gets in between the hopper and the dispensing plate which causes it to jam in the open position. You can move the lever all you want but it will not move the plate. Needless to say this causes significant problems because you can not stop the flow of fertilizer so you end up with large burn spots in your lawn.I contacted Precision and they were very nice and tried to solve the problem by shipping out some new parts free of charge. Unfortunately the new parts did not fix the problem so the spreader went into the trash can. What a waste of money. My next spreader will have solid linkage and NO CABLE!
4,Great show,"I'd recommend this show especially if you are a fan of tokusatsu shows, or watched this in English. It has great characters, and the story goes really well. My only problem with the show is that the show is not translated well, and at times the subtitles are not synced at the time that the line is being spoken."
3,A good collection but not HD quality,"The entirety of Ultraseven is in this collection recorded in both languages and subtitled. The only drawback is that the picture quality is not HD. Even with an upscaling DVD player, the picture quality is lacking."
1,Inconvenient Set-up,"I am very upset because the product does not allow the viewer to use his cursor (I watch DVDs with my computer) to jump to a chosen part of the episode. In other words, the only way to watch an episode is to play it from the BEGINNING. Each time I want to watch my favorite scene 15 minutes into an episode, I have to play the episode from the beginning and wait 15 minutes. This is ridiculous!"
1,"A glorified bootleg, do not buy.","This supposed ""official"" release is in no way official. Like the Ultraman sets of a few years ago, it comes to us not from Tsuburaya, but from Sompote Sands and his Chaiyo company. Sands, one of the biggest lying crooks on Earth, has for years claimed he owns (and even co-created) the entire Ultra franchise. Better that the shows never come to the States than come in a way that lines his coffers and not Tsuburaya's. Purchasing this is a vote of confidence for a scummy con man who has made life hell for Ultra fans for well over a decade. Anyone who believes that buying this will somehow help Tsuburaya's cause in the US is living in a fantasy world."
3,Ugly bright colored logo ruins a classic looking umbrella,"The umbrella works fine, however what does not show in the picture is that there's a very ugly Gustbuster logo that is embroidered on one of the umbrella straps that is ""multicolored and quite bright."" It makes an otherwise classic looking umbrella look cheap and tacky."
2,cheap construction,"Purchased one last winter. The design worked very well in high wind conditions. That was until one day I opened it and the thing virtually exploded on me! All the stays are held in place at the top with a flimsy twisted bit of wire. When manufactured there was probably one twist too many. All the tension provided by the spring action proved to be too much and blam! Ended up with a useless tangle of nylon material and bent aluminum. As I mentioned, the umbrella worked extremely well for the few weeks before it died, I'm just reluctant to purchase a replacement unless assured that the quality of construction has improved."
1,Same as everyone else,"This umbrella is really nice.The problem with it is it breaks SUPER easily. I babied mine because I read all the reviews on here before I bought it. The weakness is where the spindles attach themselves. It's a point that needs to support alot of stress and the cheap fiberglass spindles cannot do so.If you buy this you'll probably be sorry for doing so sooner or later. I rarely review anything on amazon but thought I would on this so others wouldn't have throw money away.Also ""lifetime guarantee"" is complete hogwash. Guarantee as in customer pays shipping + a $10 surcharge equaling $20. I'm not willing to throw another andrew jackson to the wind (no pun intended)"
2,Not good enough,"I have just used this umbrella for the first time. It held up in a very strong wind, but I noticed that there was a two inch long splitting crack in the wooden handle. I will ask Gustbuster to send me another handle so that I can replace it when the crack splits and fails to hold the umbrella stem. I didn't have the foresight to keep the packing that it came in so I don't know how I would return the entire umbrella safely to Gustbuster. The umbrella seems solid but it is not easy to carry it while on a train or bus because it is too large to fit conveniently in a crowded environment. I think it would be okay to use going to or from a car."
5,Best Umbrella EVER!,"If you're done with cheap umbrellas that turn inside-out at the slightest breeze, this is the umbrella for you! The way it's constructed, with 2 layers, allows for wind to blow through it, without you getting wet...brilliant! I later bought one for a friend as a gift."
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves and I am calling out AMAZON as well. This umbrella is ""NOT"" 48 inches and that is why I only gave two stars. I take issue with the fact that the company is misleading the customers and that Amazon allows it. The umbrella itself ""appears"" to be strong, sturdy and of good quality. However, the proof is in when it is tested under strong wind and rain. The handle is very nice. The umbrella is NOT worth what they asked for and most of that is based on the fact that it is NOT even close to 48 inches. To be fair to the company the umbrella is well constructed. I believe that businesses need to give accurate information about a product so that the consumer can make an informed decision."
4,Great Quality Umbrella,GustBuster Classic 48-Inch Automatic Golf UmbrellaThe GusterBuster Umbrella is the best umbrella I have owned thus far in my life. It is a very good quality umbrella and the design is sophisticated and appealing. This umbrella is the official umbrella of the PGA Tour. It is well worth your money if you would like an umbrella that can withstand strong winds while retaining style.
2,Not worth the money,"Decent umbrella at best, not worth the money. Had it for 5 months, used every time it rained on a weekday. The spring action has stopped ""locking"" at the top of the umbrella (I have to keep pushing it up when fully extended until it ""clicks""). The 2 crappy velcro wraps to keep in place when folded are starting to give way (Keep in mind I take care of my stuff). In addition, the company doesn't seem to care. I emailed in the warranty information when I received it, they never got back to me. Look elsewhere."
3,GustBuster - Not as good as claimed,"I purchased two of these umbrellas based on a recommendation from a friend and after checking reviews on line. I evidently received two umbrellas which did not hold up to the high standards of previous production runs. They open very clumsily, don't protect during wind gusts, actually collapse quite easily and fold/store with difficulty. Not a good purchase."
4,Performed as advertised,"The umbrella did not turn inside out during windy rains. I was protected wearing nicer clothes while walking across campus at work and when walking the neighborhood for excercise. The handle on the 48"" model was easy to grip and necessary when gusty. I intend to buy the next larger size for more coverage the next time. If the umbrella holds up through the rainy season, I would definitely rate it 5 stars. I've owned it for a month."
4,Hook to trap the umbrella failed after 4 years,"I have had the umbrella for slightly over 4 years. The hook to trap the umbrella failed recently. I had to hold the umbrella closed by the strap. It was very inconvenient as well as somewhat dangerous as the umbrella could spring open by itself in a crowded bus if it was not well secured. Four years is a short time for the spring mechanism of an umbrella to break down. Otherwise, it held up well in the wind in my very windy city. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars."
1,Gust Busted,"To make a long story short, the FIRST time I used this umbrella, the stem & one of the spindles holding up the umbrella cracked and broke in a 30 mph wind gust in driving rain. I was not pleased."
3,"Great umbrella, but not for everyone.","This is an outstanding umbrella, and it works as advertised in the often windy rain of Seattle. I do wish I would have bought the smaller one though for more money. This thing is huge! I'm not a big guy, but I feel like I'm walking around with a parachute! I think I got some lift one time when it was super windy. I'm not a big guy, so I find I am only using this when I know it's a severe storm on the way. Don't take this as a knock on the product itself though. It's a great, ginormous blue umbrella."
3,OK for casual use,"I've had this umbrella for three months and tt's an ok umbrella, for casual use. Two points of contention:1) I measured the umbrella: it has a 40"" diameter.2) The handle came off in the first week of use. I glued it back on and it should be fine.It's definitely not a high-quality be-spoke umbrella, but for the price, it's not bad."
2,not as described,the umbrella doesn't automatically retract. It is very bulky. You can get a cheaper one at supermarkets that works exactly the same way.
4,Golf Umbrella,"Bought this umbrella to see how it would perform in the wind. Have used it in the rain, but not much wind yet. But I'm sure it will stand the test."
2,"strange definition of ""diameter""","Look up diameter in the dictionary, it says the _straight line_ distance across a circular object. This umbrella is only 48"" if you measure along the rounded outer edge while open. Look at reviews for other GB umbrellas and you'll see people reporting them as smaller than described. This one is only around 37"" diameter. I called the company about this and spoke to a man who identified himself as the company president (1-888-(487-8287)) - he was rude, interrupted me constantly, and wouldn't let me even finish a sentence. First he said that that was the standard definition and then he told me that he didn't believe me when I quoted his own website. He did say he would get the website description changed, but that doesn't make selling me an umbrella smaller than described OKat this point, I'm not going to buy another GB umbrella just because I don't want to give money to a company who thinks it's OK to treat a customer the way I was treated on the phone"
2,Would not recommend this product,"I purchased the GustBuster Classic 48-Inch Automatic Golf Umbrella hoping to get a high quality product that would stand the test of time. Unfortunately, the product received did not live up to the high recommendations I'd seen. The umbrella seems to be fairly well built in terms of its canopy, but the shaft & handle is made of plastic and looks rather cheap. Upon my first use of the umbrella, a piece of metal poked through from the inside of the plastic shaft to the outside of it, hampering the automated opening of the umbrella.I presumed this was a one-off defect, returned the umbrella & ordered a replacement. To my dismay, the 2nd umbrella had the same issue. I am returning it and have ordered another brand of umbrella.The Amazon return procedure has been very good, so I've not complaints there."
3,Quality Umbrella,A good price for a well-made stylish umbrella. I'd consider a bigger version for golfing or to cover more than one person.
5,Well worth the money,I tried this umbrella in high winds and it held up as promised. I guess it's true that you get what you paid for.
1,"Great for wind, but bad quality","Great, great umbrella for living in New York CIty. Winds no longer brake umbrela. Something else brakes: velcro ties fell of after couple of uses. Handle very easy to scratch.Worst thing, manufacturer wants $10 to get it repaired. Their own defect and they want more money to get it repaired.Do not buy this low quality product!"
2,very disappointed,"Three broken struts in a couple of years. I fixed the first couple with pliars and a piece of a paper clip. Then it went into the trash. The design is great...makes a lot of sense, but the quality of the materials they use are the weak link. They sell these because the design really makes sense, but I was extremely disappointed with the longevity of it, especially considering the price."
5,"Great Umbrella, even tho I eventually bought it elsewhere","I love the umbrella, well worth the cost as it is a quality piece of gear. I haven't encountered any gale-force winds with it yet, but it seems much more solid than any other umbrella I've owned.After placing the order with Amazon, I was notified it was backordered. I cancelled the order and bought the same item (for the same price) elsewhere."
1,Not what is advertised.,The umbrella I ordered is supposed to have a 48 inch diameter canopy. I received an umbrella with a 41 inch canopy. I got my money back. How does a 41 inch canopy umbrella get advertised as a 48 inch umbrella?
4,Silly Logo...go away please,"The only thing I'm not a fan of is the green/red logo that shows up on the straps. Otherwise, this thing is a beast and a lovely addition to my campaign against weather in California."
3,Homer Simpson Chia Pet,"We received this for Christmas and it's great the only draw back in that every month or so you have to scrape off the plants and start over again. It comes with three packets of seeds so you have about 3 months supply of seeds, but Joeseph Enterprises who manufactures and distributes the Chia Pets and seeds obviously make their money by selling the seed packets which so far I haven't found a place online to order the seeds so you have to mail in the order form and a check or money order to get more seeds. Shipping is slow so order the seeds well in advance if you want them to arrive in time to replant when the current set dies and needs to be scraped off. Next time around we are gong to try seeds from another source and see if we can get them to last longer and maybe have blooms of some sort.Any questions email me at tildaandtony@earthlink.net"
1,don't waste your time,One of the worst things I've ever seen. You will learn nothing about Yeats from this tape. And the recitation of his verse is stupifyingly reverential. It was sad to see a great actress like Irene Worth involved with such fluff. Yeats is one the great poets. He deserves better than this.
3,Another Turn on a Scrooge,"Girl doesn't like life, people don't like girl. But this one turned out pretty good with a Christian outcome. It had a fairly unique twist that you don't guess."
2,"Perhaps good message, but, extremely slow","This probably has a good message, but, it was so slow, I only made it half way through...and that was after PAYING FOR IT. Since people are paying money for this, I want to be honest."
1,"Poor acting, dull",I was hoping to find a 'feel-good' Christmas theme movie to enjoy one afternoon. This was a total waste of what time I did watch and my money. I stopped the movie after half-way because it was so dull and the acting was so painfully poor. Not worth it.
1,"good, as long as it lasted, but still no replacement","I was enjoying this movie very much until the defective DVD quit working. I returned it in mid-December and have yet to receive a replacement (it is now mid-March).P.S. It is now the end of April, and STILL no replacement!!"
1,"Badly done, over-priced","I was disappointed in this dvd. In fact, I thought it was a creepy, Christian, Far-Right, dumb, movie.Tonight was the first night I put it on to watch. The story was not believable. Nothing about this movie was worth watching.I plan to carry it out to my sack to give away to others.Maybe out there will be someone who will want to see this movie, but I felt cheated, and would not have paid one penny for it."
3,Snow,The movies goes from light to dark in some areas. The price was great and got to my house quickly.
5,Wonderfully uplifting movie,"We started watching this movie on our DVR that my husband recorded from TBN. Well, another program ran over so we missed about the last 1/2 hour of the movie. I ordered it from Amazon just so we could finish the movie. We all thought we had it figured out, but were totally wrong when we finished the movie. It was a wonderful movie about love and forgiveness. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,A Christmas Snow,"Have dozens and dozens of Christmas movies, but this is by far the best. Story of redemption and healing, Christianity. Love the characters and dialogue. only Christmas movie we watched 3 times in a row this season. Purchased because of another Amazon review!!"
4,"One of the better Christmas Stories, with a year round message.","This story would be effective year round. It has a Christmas Setting. I found it to be very meaningful,moving and thought provoking. Catherine Mary Stewart did a great job. Muse Watson is excellent-in my opinion, one of his best performances!"
4,Very good movie,"Caught this on Daystar and loved it. Recorded it on the DVR and we have watched it several times. If you are expecting a Hollywood big budget blockbuster, you will be disappointed. This is a gentle, quiet story about a few ""coincidences"" that bring some hurting souls together and change their lives forever. Highly recommended."
5,Touching at so many levels,"Okay, so I'm a softy and a romantic. I especially love Father-Daughter stories. Being a dad to the most beautiful little girl in the world (yes, she's 47 now, but she's still my little girl). This is an awesome story about understanding, forgiveness, love, and emotional survival. Touches all the major buttons."
4,Give the gift of forgiveness,"This movie was a nice surprise, and I bet that we gonna see little Cameron further.When you take a spark of sweet magic, good advices and a distinguished humour, you hardly go wrong...I will ever remember Sam's advice: ""Family is a thing worth to chase!""Merry Xmas everybody!!!"
2,Lacking...,"The one thing that kept me from a one star was the song, 'Under Azure Skies'. The rest of the recording is lacking in creativity. At least there wasn't a heavy use of keyboards to add to the initial insult."
4,A Real Look At Our Country,"It actually seems just a little bit daunting,taking a bus full of mentally and physically challenged persons from their home base in New England and travel across the country interviewing stars and ordinary people alike on their way to sunny California.It is funny but as everyone has said about this documentary,it`s done in a very sympathetic way that almost always brings out the best in interviewer and their subjects with often very funny results.Heart-warming and a rare glimpse into people that we don`t usually run into in our daily lives.Worth a look....."
2,not clear what the point is,"After a recommendation this arrived via Netflix. The fact that the ""laughing with them, laughing at them"" dichotomy must be explored at all is a major failing. Disappointingly, I think most viewers will inevitably shade to the latter. While the premise of the movie, i.e., a cross-country trip and accompanying filmic narrative, is compelling and nominally empowering for the participants, the audience is left only to chuckle and casually observe, not truly engage, empathize or otherwise understand those in the movie. There are far superior efforts at engaging those who are mentally and physically disadvantage or otherwise ""different."""
2,Solar Spotlight,"bummer, not a spotlight as one would expect, not very illuminating, I got it to illuminate an American flag, the LED lights are over rated"
2,I Have to Agree with Sour...,"I just finished the book, and while the spirit of the thing is terrific, I was a little disappointed with the typos and misstated facts - there are also a lot of lyric errors and one page that seems to end with the middle of a sentence and doesn't connect with the next page.The author is obviously a big fan but some of his articles sound a bit too much like research papers for college.I hope a future edition (if there is one) will correct this stuff."
3,Mixed Thoughts,"I have mixed thoughts about this book. There are things in it that I have found very helpful, but it's not consistent in assuming the starting level of someone's working knowledge and terminology. I have found the internet to be a better source for some things (not all) because some of those demonstrations explain every detail of every step. I wish there was a beginners version, but am still happy I have this book. I wish I knew where the skill level began in other books."
4,What can I say?,"This is a standard reference book for working on these classic bikes. If you're going to own one, you should have this book, the Haynes manual, and a copy of the Honda factory manual. The more illustrations and explanations you have, the better."
3,A must have...but not the only thing you need,This is a must have book if you own a Honda CB550. I have a 77 CB550F and it does the job to help you out with repairs. You will find that this is not the holy bible for motorcycle maitenence.
5,Wonderful book for homeschoolers and teachers!,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. I take their review with a grain of salt after taking a look at their history.Although I'm not a history major, I found the book to be excellent! I used it to teach art in a local co-op. I did supplement and change a few projects to make them more interesting, but overall, I thought this was well laid out, informative and fun. It's got a wealth of ideas in there and could easily be used for a multitude of subjects year round. Definitely recommended!"
1,"Ridiculous...this author knows nothing about anthropology and just made stuff up. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, AUTHOR IS AN IDIOT","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK....THIS AUTHOR IS AN IDIOT, AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ANTHROPOLOGY OR ART, ITS NOT WORTH THE PAPER ITS PRINTED ON. SAVE YOUR MONEY. She attempts to be PC without knowing anything about art, or history...just another silly person attempting to sell books. DON'T BUY IT."
5,"Finally, a documentary about these guys with no corny romanticism","Those of you who saw the New Order documentary were probably writhing around in pain, as I was, at the endless corny romanticizing and the absolutely terrible and overly dramatic narration. I feared that this Joy Division documentary would be the same, but the fact that Grant Gee was directing kept my hopes up. He does not disappoint. This is a fantastic document of not only Ian Curtis, but of the entire band and how they started together. Gee sidesteps the tendency of most film makers to dwell on Ian Curtis the entire time, and does not preoccupy himself with stuff that we all know about. It features great interviews, and is edited with a lot of style.In the end, the film is presented like the band itself: very brief, very inspiring, and leaving the crowd wanting more."
5,It All Falls Apart At First Touch...,"As a longtime Joy Division fan, I was eagerly anticipating this DVD and it does not disappoint. I especially like how the story weaves in the influence of Manchester (we are products of our environment, aren't we?) and the special chemistry between all four members--a chemistry that was not really discussed or examined. This is a must-have for all JD fans. So many nuggets of information about the group, the gigs and the recordings. (Also, highly recommended is the related documentary from a few years ago called Shadowplayers about the whole Manchester scene in the late 70s, early 80s.) The one thing that always gets me though is how Hooky, Bernard and Morris say that they never really listened to Ian's lyrics. I guess that is what is also so shocking about Ian's suicide is that in retrospect his lyrics seemed to be detailing a road map to his final irreversible act."
4,Joy in Making,Interesting doco of the UK music band popular quater century ago.It broadened my general knowledge of music and a time gone.
2,movie case csme smashed,"Good story, acting. Insightful look atva great band. My particular dvd came withva smashed case snd thst wasn't part of the deal. I'll live...."
2,Good idea but poor execution,It starts with a great argument that Manchester made the band and the band helped shape modern Manchester but then it digresses into a bunch of career talk that isn't new and isn't interesting. At the end they try to reintroduce the opening argument but it is way too late. Hook is one of my favorite bass players but he's painfully boorish. And you know the ending of this documentary will be unhappy for the viewer but you realize that the death of Ian Curtis was only a speed bump for these guys. They went on to sell 20 million records without Curtis and they may feel blessed that he wasn't their singer any longer than he was.
3,what's needed,"attention,please.let's all agree this film is an important document and is certainly worth all the kind words offered so far.the next step is to urge the owner of the video of the plan k gig (mister nicholson of ikon&?)(the photographer,monsieur michel?)to release the entire concert on DVD for worldwide distribution.i'm sure questions of copyright and other legal niceties can certainly be surmounted.since a miniscule number of fans actually saw the lads in concert(and since the brussels one-off is possibly the only film extant other than the footage shot by mister boon)wouldn't it be great to have something everyone could appreciate for years to come-a consummately rocky band at the absolute top of its game at a prestige venue?"
3,Documentary,"Good side: It is great collection of interviews (even with real Annik Honoré).The bad side: Created today, little archival content :-(Anyway, it is well to watch it.Tim."
1,unhappy part uno,"i bought this dvd expecting to get something for the cheapness of the actual thing that i actally got in the end, which is a dvd about the post punk emo band that had a singer that committed a sin against humanity."
3,"Fun Movie, Fun CD","""Kingdom Come"" is one of those feel-good movies along the lines of ""Soul Food"" and ""Waiting to Exhale,"" both of which featured great soundtracks. The same applies here. Like others in the movie theater, I too rushed to the music store to buy this CD once the movie ended. I've been playing it ever since. It's exhilarating. It's funky. It will also get you up on your feet dancing."
4,Kingdom come,"Enjoyable Cd. wish there was more upbeat songs, but I guess it's fitting to the movie since it was about a funeral."
4,Great Listening CD,I had this CD and lost and just had to get it back. A great variety of singers and good music.
4,Where's that one song?,"I like the soundtrack, but where's the song that's played in the trailer (the last song in the trailer) and on the official webpage? Great song, but can't find it anywhere!"
5,Mr. COLD MISER & Mr. HEAT MISER!!,"OK, what can I say but here is the DVD you want for the holidays! It has ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" and with the Mr. Cold Miser (My Favorite) and Mr. Heat Miser acts, plus Dr. Seuss and others listed! Boy do I love the Cold and Heat Miser songs!Play this while you're putting up decorations, to help get into the Christmas mood! Buy it so you don't have to keep looking through the TV Listings to see when it'll be on to watch/record.It's sad they don't make this type of Christmas shows anymore."
5,Great Christmas memories!!,"Love these videos, brings back lots of great memories from mychildhood. Well worth the money!"
5,All in One Christmas DVD,"I was searching for these TV specials for years and could only find some of them as single DVD's. When I found them as a set, I was excited. I will keep this for years to come and hand them down as keepsakes for generations to enjoy."
4,Good value,This is a great little deal. Good ole Christmas tales for adults and children alike and helps bring on the Christmas spirit.
2,Not what was expected,Misrepresented - the only original was the Grinch. The other 3 movies were not the originals - very dissappointed.
4,A Flintstones Christmas Carol,The DVD went down very well with all the family except Gramps who prefers Opera
2,"Ultimately, she doesn't subvert anything","I bought this book before my own wedding looking for an insightful deconstruction of the modern wedding-industrial complex by someone who went out of her way not to do everything by the book. Although Cohen agonizes along the way about all of the traditions associated with a modern American wedding, she systematically embraces each and every one-- the white dress; the wedding bands; the first dance; the multiple-day wedding with several events; even the prized NY Times ""Vows"" wedding announcement! What is so unusual about her wedding experience except that she experienced a lot of post-feminist, Ivy League, liberal angst about it? (I say this as a feminist Ivy Leaguer myself). Ultimately, she lacked the courage to be different and the book, on the whole, casts her in a rather unsympathetic and self-centered light."
3,Just OK,"This book is worth reading as a commentary on the Heart Sutra, but the title promises more than the book delivers. Tie-ins to quantum physics are perfunctory, infrequent and somewhat simplistic."
4,Good for Disney channel fans,"While my kids may be a bit young for this video, the oldest (just under 3) appreciates the sing-along far better than she tolerates the Winnie the Pooh cartoons; for some reason she can't make it through a half-hour of the show while she can manage this video. She is especially drawn to the Scrapbook song, which is current Disney channel ""filler"" between ""Bear"" and the other shows. Several of the songs are also recognizable from the Tigger movie, which she liked. In all, I think this video is a good way to introduce younger children to Pooh and his friends without losing too much interest. it also makes for interesting times when she expects her parents to read the lyrics to her off the screen; that is probably the real treat here is to hear an adult actually try to keep pace with the show."
1,Fell well below expectations,"Although I do my best to enjoy all the CD's that I buy, I didn't enjoy this one. I saw them live and thought that they were decent but not spectacular, and I was told that their CD was better, but it is not. The songs fell well below the bar set by other bands, completely lacking energy and completely dousing any desire to dance. The band is okay but the singer is aweful. This has to be the only band that could mess up ""Caravan."" If you've seen them live and liked their stuff, go for it, but I was not impressed."
5,Get One if you Can,"I have four audiotron players - 3 in use, and one spare. There remains nothing like this in existence on the present market. It requires NO server software or file modification. It just plays your .mp3 files, sorting by genre, album and artist.I have tried other players, but have been disappointed with difficult programming, lack of user-friendliness, lack of response, and just plain difficulty in using. The Audiotron remains, after all these years, clearly an item ahead of it's time.With just a few simple changes, I believe it would be a viable player today. I suggest only the following: 1. Wireless connectivity, and 2. a FLAC codec. (maybe also the ability to have users load other codecs - wma, ogg, etc.)There are still some of these around. Get one if you can. You probably won't be disappointed."
2,"Poor design, nice implementation","The idea is great, play all the MP3's on your PC through your stereo system. If you've already got your home networked, the Audiotron hardware installation is no problem. The configuration instructions were extremely confusing, but by trial and error I got it working. Once up, it sounds super and looks sharp on the shelf with the stereo.Here's the glitch, each time the Audiotron loses power it must download the titles of all your MP3's. This takes about 30 minutes for my library (250 CDs). So what's the problem you ask? The power winks off at my house about once a week. Unless you walk by the Audiotron every morning to see if it's still on, you'll find it dead when you sit down to listen to music. Too bad it doesn't power back on after an outage automatically, but it doesn't.I have two little Rio Receivers as well (no longer in production) which get a lot more use than this gadget. They boot up in about a minute. It's a real shame the Audiotron doesn't do the same."
4,Finally someone speaks without Zionist propaganda,"Cordon and Search is an excellent book for those trying to find out more of what really happen in post war Palestine. The book is a unit history of the 6th Airborne Division - a major unit but not the only large British formation in Palestine. It is concerned primarily with the activities of the Division and tries to stay away from politics, but the politics come out in secondary ways, such as rosters of weapons seized and accounts of operations and sabotage. For those who find the popular Hollywood version of the beginnings of Israel hard to swallow, this is a good book to begin unraveling fact from fiction. Patterns established during those post year wars are clearly seen still at work in the mechanizations of the Israeli government as well as in what the Palestinians have learned over the years regarding the impact of using terrorism as a tool of Politics."
1,This is possibly one of the worst books I've ever read!,"The story line is weak, the characters are totally different from what they usually are and overall this book drove me mad. The characters never stopped fighting over petty little things. Most of the time I was wishing the book would just end. There are loads of Sweet Valley's that are ten times better than this, I wouldn't go near this book if I were you. I'm giving it one star because I can't give it any lower mark."
3,This book was weird,I didn't really like this book because they characters wouldn't quit fighting. I did like how they tricked the bad people. So I give this 3 stars for effort and creativity
4,no title,"This is an expensive book that may indeed be useful, but the written English is either not edited or badly edited. That may seem a small point, but a book that has grammatical errors in almost every paragraph can be hard to read."
4,Nice,"An entertaining perfect translation of some of Capcom's most sucessful games. It is a shame though that both Street Fighter Alpha 3 versions in this game do not include the World Tour mode. Also, in Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold and Alpha 3 Capcom should have just included SSII, turbo, and all known characters already without forcing you to find them by completing the games and entering codes. Like in Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max for the PSP, which also includes the World Tour mode. If you have a PSP and aren't really a die hard Street Fighter fan, then choose the PSP alpha 3 max over this game. Now if you are this type of fan then both games are must have for your collection if you have both systems, if not then pick the one that plays for the syastem you own."
4,New Classic Brawling,"Not the greatest Street Fighter (imo that would be SF2 Turbo), but a collection of some of the best of the prequel series, with a bit of lighter beat-em-up fare in the form of Pocket Fighter.This manages to be the semi-definitive versions of all the games included by incorporating the arcade dipswitch options (allowing you to change some environmetal and character settings to your personal tastes) on top of the usual difficult/control/sound options. Only the exclusion of the character move listings from the original console releases detracts from the quality of this collection.Definitely recommended for fans of Street Fighter, especially the Alpha/Zero series."
3,Kinda cool!!,"I am a fan of the street fighter alpha series, and I think this game was a great idea!!! It's a collection of 5 games in all, and they are all challenging in their own way. Anyway pretty sweet game!!"
2,Save your money,"It's a watered down version of each Alpha title. If you previously bought and played each original before (arcade, emulator), you will notice they cut a lot of corners with this anthology (controls not as responsive, less sprites, etc). I consider the Alpha series to be the best in S.F. franchise. CAPCOM is just wanting to make a quick buck with this hack-job. If you're a purist, pass on this. If you're collector or just gotta own anything S.F., then go for it."
4,A game for my nephew,"I bought this game for my nephew and he really enjoyed playing. I have not played the game, but from what I saw it looked like fun."
5,I love Street Fighter!,"This game is the shizzle! I love the ""alpha"" series of Street Fighter the most. The artwork and game play is raw. I love Marvel vs Capcom 2 but Im an old schooler when it comes to fighting games and nothing beats Street Fighter Alpha 3. Thank You Capcom and Amazon!!!"
4,Excellent Collection,The games are all great and Gem Fighter is really fun to play I found my wife enjoyed playing it as well. You really need to play with two people instead of the game AI to enjoy it.
4,a great collection from my fave fighting game series!,"I have liked all of the SF games that I've played, and this collection presents several of them, which is really cool. I enjoy all of the games on this disc, but Gem Fighter just may be the most fun of them all! The games have a lot of cool characters but also a few who are a bit lame, which seems to be true of most if not all fighting games (that I've played, anyway), and there aren't any super-ultra-mega moves (like the Meteor Combos in EX3, which is at the moment my fave SF game of all and the latest one that I've played). But even these factors don't detract much from the fun. (Even the lame characters are worth playing as, at least occasionally!) Overall, a great collection --- recommended for fighting game fans!"
5,Street fighter alpha anthology,"great 5 in one game. if you like the street fighter alpha series or street fighter zero series, you will like this game. this game has street fighter alfa 1, 2, 2 gold, 3 and gem fighters. highly recomend."
5,alpha blast of anthology fun,"this game comes complete with five of alpha street fighter games on one disc.alpha warriors,alpha 2,alpha 2 gold,streetfighter 3 andbonus game also.there are various combo moves and plenty of high speed bells and whistles.pick your poison,great game!!"
5,"""an artist must be the conscience of his age""","Starting in 1921 with the return to his homeland after many years in Europe, this marvelous film gives those of us who haven't had the opportunity to view these amazing masterpieces in person, a glimpse as to the size and scope of these frescoes.I was fascinated to learn, and see by examples, the influence that Italian Renaissance painting had on his work. In the use of perspective, and the way certain figures are posed, one can see the relationship between Rivera and the Italian Masters, but he transformed it into an art that is 100 % Mexican.Written by Michael Camerini (who also directed) and Stanton L. Catlin, it's well narrated by Michael Moriarty, with his calm and lovely voice. This terrific video (it feels way too short at 35 minutes in length) will inspire and give you a lot to think about if you're an artist, and will be a treat for those that appreciate the genius of Diego Rivera."
2,Bigger than it says it is,"Although this might be a wonderful watch, it was a half centimeter larger in each direction than it said it is. I did not get a watch that is 40 x 35 mm, I got one that's 45 x 40. I'm sending it back."
2,Watch,"Not really a big fan of this watch, I feel like I wasted my money. The display is small, the button don't respond well, I love my Timex Triatholon with flix technology wish I would've just bought a new one of those."
5,"Great watch, worth the price","I've had this watch for over 6 months now. I've put it through the scorching summer heat, humidity, and lots of sweat as well as a few summer rain showers. It still works perfectly.The large numbers are easy to see. The oversized buttons are easy to press, which is especially important for sprint workouts. For both those reasons, I much prefer this watch to my prior watch, the Casio Men's 93H-1AV Multifunction Sport Watch."
5,Timex = The poor people's ROLEX,"This watch caught my eye about 6 months ago but I kept telling myself that I didn't need another watch. I went against my better judgement and purchased it. I am extremely happy I did. From the good looks and color matching to the easy of setting, this is a great timepiece for the everyday person. Simple to read digital time and date because the numbers are big enough that you don't need to squint to see them. The resin band is very comfortable. I do not have one complaint about this watch. For once I really got my money's worth.KB"
2,review,the layout was not clear for the plans the lines for 1/4 inch over powered the plans and everything sort of blended in
3,Uneven quality,"The recording quality is uneven. Some songs are kind of ""muddy,"" others clean and clear. An OK collection but not necessarily the best bunch of songs from the Disney films."
5,My favorite soda but so hard to find :(,"I typicaly drink Mountain Dew or more recently the Picth Black but this is my favorite soda! Beaware they have tried to change the logo and add the words ""Fruit Punch"" ... as if we don't know. It's just a bad logo change and someone should be fired for it. Unfortunatly I have yet to find a substitute for the times when I can't find it so get it while you can!"
5,Not since 40 years ago,"Finally Tahitian Treat is back. They disappeared it 40 years ago, and finally it's back (and hopefully stays)."
5,Lucky you if in your area,"If you have this have you tried it as a soda shake? Vanilla ice cream and T T a taste of heaven. I grow up with this soda but it has not been in NY state for about 30 years. I wish it was here. I did find it in Florida while on vacation, it was the best thing about that vacation. Bought a second suitcase just to bring 8 2 liter bottles home. Before the new airline rules. If you can afford the $30 shipping charge from amazon do try, you will not regret it."
1,useless jar opener,"I purchased the Evriholder jar opener and used it once to open a bottle of gatoraid.the next time I wanted to open a jar of Delmonte grapefruit,I spread the opener to fit the cover about three inches and pop it snaped in half.The opener has little to no expansion this should have been mentioned in the item description."
1,Useless,This item broke during its 2nd use! Very brittle plastic. Had an older version that lasted 5 years. Won't order this again.
1,Evriholder EasiTwist Jar Opener,This product is terrible. I bought three of these to give as gifts. The first one I gave to my daughter and as my husband was demonstrating how it worked it broke in the middle. Later we tried a second one and it did exactly the same thing. These are made of hard plastic which have absolutely no give. I wasted my money!!! I own one of another brand which is more flexible and I love it. Do not buy this one!
2,OK not great...but good company!,"Product not great, but nice folks to deal with. Item broke right away, but they replaced it immediately. Still have had better jar openers."
1,DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK!,WHEN YOU REALLY NEED HELP OPENING A JAR - YOU REALLY NEED HELP - YOU DON'T NEED THE TOOL YOU'RE USING TO BREAK IN HALF AND STILL NOT OPEN THE JAR! LOOKED LIKE A NEAT PRODUCT BUT FOR ME IT WAS A LEMON - OF COURSE I COULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN THE ONE 'SPECIAL' OPENER OF THE BUNCH.
3,Love it.....but,"This opener is very functional and easy to use. Unfortunately, the second time I used it, the jar was a bit bigger than the largest size and, not thinking, I tried to spread it a bit further to fit and it broke. I've glued it back, but haven't tested yet t see if it will work. So, my final evaluation is: it's a great item, just be careful!"
2,It should have more grip space on the small end.,It should have more grip space on the small end. It' very difficult for an older person with less hand strength to operate.
5,Works!!!,"I have health issues that make it hard for my hands to grip stuff, this thing is used daily to open screw top lids of all sizes I wouldnt be without it!Mine was purchased at a local grocer but it looks identical to the one pictured here.Dont hesitate to try it its awesome if you need a little help! :)"
5,Great Gadget!,"How many different jar openers have any of us purchased that only sort of work? Well, this one works on both large and small tops -- providing lots of leverage and gripping power. Great for small hands, even with some arthritis. Note that they are not always blue as shown. Mine arrived in bright red with orange trim. Actually pretty nice!"
1,Bad...especially if you have arthritis in hands,Trash. Bought this because I have painful hands d/t arthritis. Trouble opening jars. Thought this would give me more leverage and help. NOT! This HURT WORSE to use. Don't be fooled.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK. IT BROKE IN HALF THE FIRST TIME MY WIFE TRIED TO USE IT. ALSO ON THE BACK OF THE CARD IT CAME ATTACHED TO IT SAY'S "" MADE IN CHINA PROP 65 WARNING, THIS PRODUCT MAY CONTAIN CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING. STAY AWAY FROM THIS OPENER IT SHOULD NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE!!!!!!"
2,Not really up to the job,I have found that this does not really do what the advertisements say it will. I found it readily slips and is not worth having in the drawer. I will look further.
2,Not good with arthritis,"I have arthritis in my wrist, so have trouble opening jars. Twisting is too hard on my hand, so I though tis woulBut this tool requires a strong grasp, and the arthritis stops me. I would not recommend it to anyone with arthritis in hand or wrist."
3,"It's ok, not great",Seems to work if you can get a good grip on the jar with the device. The device is plastic so it does move under pressure and change form to the point where it loses some of its effectiveness.
2,Easi Twist Jar Opener,"I expected the Easi Twist Jar Opener to do just that. I have not been successful in actually getting it to work. Maybe I just don't have enough wrist strength. I don't know. Nevertheless, I will continue to try using it."
5,The EasiTwist Jar Opener,My wife really enjoys using the jar opener works well and its great for different sizes jar or bottle lids.
4,Ordered as a replacement.,"I've owned one of these for several years and would probably still be using the same one except I ran it through the dishwasher many times which I assume is what lessened the strength of the plastic grip and caused pieces to break off. When I received my replacement opener, it specifically states not to put in the dishwasher. Expect this one to last many years as well."
3,Good product,"I gave this product as a giftbut it had a great priceand when I wrap it, it seemsvery well made."
2,EasiTwist JarOpener,"Complete waste of my money. My reason for odering the opener is that I cannot get enough of a grip on a jar to open it.This 'thing' requires more strength in my wrists, than I even Have. For someone with limited strength in their wrists, my advice is - this will not solve your problem."
5,Nice quality,The jar opener fits conveniently in a drawer and is super easy to use. It arrived within a week. A great buy.
5,Makes opening ANYTHING easy!,"I gave my first Evriholder opener to a 90 year old friend. I couldn't find a replacement opener anywhere. Then I remembered good ole' Amazon. Thank you Amazon. It's great to have my opener again. I use it everyday and it's soooooooo easy to use,"
1,Broke on second use,I tried to open a jar and split right in the middle. I am not sure if this was a defective piece or is a inferior quality product.
5,"awkward to use, but useful","This was a gift for my grandmother, to give her some extra leverage to open tight jars. She's old and it was a little confusing to get at first... as how to hold it and twist off a lid - I know, it seems so simple to most of us but the elderly .... hahah it's like you can see the blue screen pop up inside their head when presented with a new ""gadget"" or tool they're not used to.I have one for myself and only need it for the jars that Hercules closed."
3,Ok but looking for something better,"It helps sometimes but not always. It depends on the jar. Some just don't grip as well and seem to slide around instead of grabing on. It hasn't broken on me, but I will keep looking."
2,Jar Opener,This jar opener worked great the first time it was used. On the second use it broke in half. Maybe it was defective or maybe you get what you paid for.
5,Best Purchase Ever,"I'd been struggling with opening one-gallon water bottles until I got EasiTwist. It's been a life saver since. I couldn't be happier! It opens bottles and jars in one twist, no strength needed."
2,Don't bother,"Waste of money. Doesn't grip well on jar lids and tends to slide. Too flexible. Good concept, but needs improved upon."
1,Worthless,"I had the same problem most others, it broke the first time I tried it on a jar of jelly. Don't wast your time, effort and money on this."
3,If you have grip problems,"This is not the product for those with grip problems, like meIt works, just not with my arthritic hands"
1,"weak, useless, save your money","Found the rare jar that i couldn't open with my bare hands, so i grabbed the easi-twist and tried it.The easi-twist did not do the job and it started to break, the inside rubber started to peel out and the handle is showing evidence of stress cracking.I had to use 16"" channelock pliers to open the jar."
4,Works for most jars,I bought this because I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and I have difficulty opening various bottles and jars. This product is nice because it does fit most things. Like milk gallons or soda bottles. I would recommend this.
1,snapped in half during first use,Bought this device for an elderly relative. We tried to open a medium-sized jar of jam and the thing snapped into two parts as we tried to fit it around the lid. Felt super cheap to the touch. The device looked as if it was returned previously since it was scratched and dirty. Do not buy.
2,plastic not too durable,"At first I thought this was going to be the best purchase I had ever made. We used it successfully for 3 weeks and it worked very well. Then my wife was struggling with a cheese-whiz jar (I know, what were you doing opening that in the first place?) and spread it open to fit the large jar mouth and the plastic support, right at the apex snapped in two. Now it is totally useless. The concept is great and I guess if they would use a stronger or more flexible support plastic it would be a winner. My search goes on."
5,Talking Turkey: And Other Stories of North Carolina's Oddly,"This is a delightful and insightful book that is well researched. It has very interesting background on many place names and gives the reader a new understanding on why we have such odd names for many of our towns, etc. I am sure that the same kind of explanations may be applied to place names in many states, not just North Carolina; therefore this book is not just for North Carolinians!"
5,seemingly effortless magic,"After hearing Edward Field at a 1969 poetry reading, I bought Stand Up Friend, With Me. I was amazed by his quirky insights into mundane matters -- body hair, graffiti, animals, etc. They were so accessible, so seemingly effortless, so magical, and rereading only made them better. I found myself compelled to share them with others, buying several copies and giving them away. Both my literary and non-literary friends reacted instinstively and enthusiastically to them. It is an endearing collection of poems that will remain forever in your heart."
3,fragile,"you really can't move the body parts around. They will break off. I would say it's not a toy. it's more of a showpiece. We have several from the same place, and they were not really cheap, so it was disappointing for my kids."
4,Awsome watch but,"This watch exactly what I wanted and looks even better in person than photos.I am however a bit disapointed at how easily the brushed stainless finish scratches. I very quickly noticed some scratches appearing from the bracelet rubbing up against the corner of my desk while typing (wood desk). Under closer investigation, I noticed that I can actually scratch the finish with my nail... Not exactly what I expected out of a high quality rugged watch.Dont get me wrong, we are talking very fine scatches but they add up and after 7 months, one half of the bracelet looks more like I've had the watch for a few years."
1,Amazon did badly,I bought this watch from Amazon due to price and I regret it. Watch was delivered without COSC certificate so there is a chance it's a fake one. For my questions I was adviced by Amazon customer support to go to Tag Heuer for certificate. It's really a shame....My advice to everybody- think twice before you buy from Amazon- and do not do it finally.
3,Beware,"From what I was told, TAG does not have any authorized online retailers in their current sales network. If you want a real TAG you should probably go to a real store and get one. I am a big fan of Amazon but I ended up purchasing my new TAG Aquaracer Date Chronograph from a Jewler rather than take the chance."
2,Would love to hear this guitarist in more interesting material,"Frasca is obviously a fine instrumentalist and is to be commended for working to expand repertoire and performance resources. But too much of the material here is stretched beyond its intrinsic quality. I'm certainly not allergic to minimalism, but, on this disc, there is just too much that is numbingly repetitive. I'll still be interested in what Frasca does next."
2,Quality is very very poor,"CRAFTSMAN SHOE STORAGE 1-DOOR 24-PAIR MACINTOSH OAK: An aesthetically beautiful cabinet, but a PAIN to assemble. From the start everything, and I mean everything was off. The dowels were too big and pre-drilled holes too small, the directions were incomplete, the panels were uneven so the cabinet didn't stand flush on the ground without a shim below the legs and frankly, for 229.00 I wasn't too impressed with the quailty---nice veneers, but cheap, cheap backside panel (pressed wood) AND last but not least the size of the shoe slots are TOO SMALL. This cabinet is best suited for children's shoes only. It is only a 24 shoe cabinet if your placing children's shoes into them and/or one adult shoe per shoe slot. Not worth the cost or bother. I would have returned it, but it would have cost me more money than the cabinet is worth and I actually had to drill the holes bigger to make the dowels fit. What a frustrating experience."
1,INSOMNIACS REJOICE!!! A CURE HAS BEEN FOUND!!!,"MS. FOSTER SHOULD READ SOME REAL ROMANCE BOOKS BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTS ANOTHER NOVEL, IF THIS IS THE BEST THERE IS FORTHCOMING FROM HER PEN!! IT'S AS IF SHE'S AFRAID TO TOUCH ON WRITING ABOUT LOVE-MAKING, LET ALONE WRITE A SCENE ABOUT IT!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. GO DO THE LAUNDRY INSTEAD!! I SUGGEST SHE TAKE SOME PAGES OF OUR MS.RAY, MS. JACKSON AND MS FORD'S BOOKS BEFORE PUTTING PEN TO PAPER AGAIN. TOO BAD YOU DON'T ALLOW LESS THAN ONE STAR RATINGS. THIS ONE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE TOP WITH THAT!!"
3,Good read but a little slow,Definitely a good read especially over the weekend or while at the beach. Glad that both Emily & Melissa got the happiness they deserved once they got away from Rafer and his toxic attitudes.
2,Not the best,The story line started out good but become boring and repetitive as it went on. I found myself skipping quick a few pages just to finish the book. Should have stop reading it but I wanted to know how it ended.
2,Not worth the time,"The book started off great, but quickly turned into a long, drawn out story. The story did not keep my interest and the supposed ""twist and turns"" were not surprising. I was disappointed and will not read another book by this author."
3,Not the author's best,While this title was not the author's best it is still a worthwhile read. I found the subplot to be a much more compelling love story than the love affair between the main characters. The story dragged in a few places and it was difficult to believe that the other characters could be so shallow. I hope that the author returns to the style of writing that made Beyond Desire such an exciting and evocative read.
5,Gatekeeper to Los Alamos: Dorothy Scarritt McKibbin,I have visited McKibbin's home on the plaza of Santa Fe several times and heard tidbits about her several times so it was great to be able to read the whole story of her life and her contributions to the project at Los Alamos.
4,Name Brand Surge Protector,Isobar was the best surge protector I could buy in 1989 with my IBM 8088 XT. I just like the name and figure you get what you pay for. I have had a few Wal*mart $8 surge protectors go out already. Yes I bought a Bill Gates system already.
1,Burst into flames!!,"Would have left the star rating empty if possible. Paid over $60.00 and it worked ok for 3 months. Then two weeks ago, one evening it just started shooting flames. Burnt and melted our heater plug (useless now), plus burnt our recliner some, too. Luckily, I smelled it before it got ""out of control"".I bought an $18.00 Belkin surge protector at the same time. No problems. Works perfectly.Very disappointed with the product. What if we were gone from home and it had burst into flames...?I have zero trust in Tripp Lite's products. It might be a product flaw but I wouldn't leave it plugged in if I were you.Tripp Lite gets a ""F""."
5,Read it on the plane,Great easy read for a plane ride or a short trip. This is a good companion to his other books on management.
2,sharks box set,I found this video a little lacking as far as detailed facts. The cinematography was good at times and not so good at others. I would recommend this video to younger people as an introduction to sharks.
4,Classic Keith opinions on rifles,"Those of us who hunt and shoot know Elmer Keith was a giant in the field. ""Inventor"" of handgun's .357 Magnum, .41 Magnum and .44 Magnum, he was also a long time guide, hunter and prolific writer. So I was pleased to receive a copy of his original text as a gift.First, since the book was published 1936, it's obvious that Keith speaks of a time few of us have experienced: bigger game, more primitive conditions and possibly hardier hunters (at least much more rugged than this reviewer).This is supposed to be a somewhat technical treatise on rifles and calibers, and Keith does demonstrate a keen eye for the performance of various rifles and calibers. In doing so, he also gives us a peek into the practices and culture of the times....a peek that is sometimes objectionable today. Nonetheless, this book is a good primer on hunting the West, ""best"" guns, cartridges and bullets of the times, and an interesting glimpse of a younger Elmer Keith."
5,"So glad I purchased ""So Glad!""","Yet another triumph for Bill Gaither and his phenomenal cadre of musicians and singers! These gifted Christian minstrels will ""tell you the old, old story of Jesus and His love"" in melodious, harmony-filled manner that will lift your souls! Buy it. Now! You'll thank me later!"
5,Fabulous organizer for a busy Mom!,I've given this book as a gift to all my daughters: and they love it!
3,Need room for more kids,"I love the organization value, but if they were to revamp the book I'd request that there be enough room for at least 4 children. I am a very busy mom and appreciate being able to take all my info. with me to work and school. I just need more room. Also about 10 blank pages in the back would be good for other info. Maybe laminated pages so you could use dry erase markers on some of the school and grocery pages so you can change the info. as the info. changes."
1,"too much , overkill","I bought this book because it looked good. Once I opened it, I was disappointed in thecontent. There are too many forms and checklists and most information is useless. I have developped my own system in which I use a 5 x 8 binder. It is easy to copy my forms and lists and is less bulky than their book. Their checklists are too expensive to keep ordering. My advice: save your money and make your own record keeper."
2,Not really for stay-at-home moms,"As a homeschooling stay-at-home mom of 3 boys, I was disappointed in the way this book gears more towards moms who work outside the home. Also, as another reviewer stated, there is no room for extra children -- I have 3 but we are planning on having more and I wouldn't know what to do with their information."
3,It was Ok but not enough froms or information for teenager.,As a older mother with older childern it did not meet my needs. I find that I need more not less Organizer help. I'am dealing with teenagers and Grandchildern at the same time it would have been nice to have more information on the physcial management of a home. I love the thought that part of profit goes to charities. I gave my copy to a young mother of two. I know it will be of great help to her and her young family I wish it would have been in print 20 years ago.
2,Not for SAHM's of young ones,"I returned this book because the sections didn't really apply to me. I am a SAHM with an infant & the sections about planning b-day parties, choosing a nanny, etc. didn't apply.I also found there wasn't enough room to record all I needed to & there was no real way to re-use the pages. It was heavy & bulky as well.I think I've been doing much better since I invested in a Franklin Planner."
1,Disappointing...not what I expected,"I expected this book to be my central source of vital household and family information once the blanks were filled in. Instead, the book contained dozens of checklists and at least three sections that I don't need. The few pages I did find useful requested information I'd already entered into my handheld PDA months ago. Chances are this book will collect dust on a shelf, or will be passed on to a friend who may find it more useful."
1,Just a Bunch of Lists,"I thought I was buying a ""family organizer"" (i.e, a family calendar). This book just had a bunch of useless generic lists with a nice cover and fancy tabs."
5,All Important Information is in ONE PLACE!,"I love having all information in one place! Of course every one has all of this information at home...but you have to FIND IT! I use my book so much,I always know where it is. The lists have helped me when traveling, with babysitting, and when I'm on the phone, I have all the answers in my book. The pages are durable and will stand up to the burtal treatment of erasers. I expect this book to last for years to come. I added my own ""tabs"" to the book to mark my favorite lists. The book is a perfect gift for a ""new baby""!"
2,Not at all what I expected...,very unhappy with this purchase...a checklist overload...it is still sitting on my bookcase...not very practical for actual use.
2,This book only gives you the FEELING of being organized,"I got the book ""Mom Central"" for Christmas (from Amazon.com!), but I'm really not very happy with it - it's just a bunch of lists and it's not in a 3 ring binder or anything, so if you use one of the lists you destroy the book.It's the sort of book that may make someone FEEL organized when they first write all the info in it, but then they'll just have to re-write it later when they outgrow the book (which seems like it would happen pretty quickly!)I think getting yourself a small 3-ring binder and some colored paper would make more sense!"
4,I needed Mom Central!,"I am the kind of person who writes notes on too many ""little yellow stickies"" and has to go searching through those little pads to get back the information. Mom Central has given me one organized place to record all the pertinent information I need to keep handy and my family or caregiver may need in my absence. An added bonus is the momcentral.com website and their monthly on-line newsletters which are full of useful information."
3,Black Theology of Liberation,"There were quite a few highlighted pages that sort of made the reading distracting, however overall it was fine. I took another look at the description regarding the condition of the book and noticed that it had, indeed, mentioned the highlights. I just didn't think there would be so many.I purchased a book from another vendor though Amazon.com on the same day. That vendor sent, in addition to the book I ordered, a brand new copy of the Introducing Black Theology of Liberation so I'm giving the copy I actually orded to someone else in my class.....It all turned out well. They were happy to get it.....highlights and all. :)"
3,Missed one detail...,"The heat sink is polished but the fan seems a bit out of place relative to the polished heat sink. However, I haven't seen too many fan this small so perhaps that's as good as it gets. The one detail that's missing are the pins that secure it to the board--they are not included! Too heavy to glue so for anyone looking to upgrade from nothing or stock sink to something this fancy, better find a couple of plastic pins to keep it on the chip. I can't comment on noise level because I have other fans that are drowning out the noise. By itself it's not that quiet given a tiny fan has to spin pretty fast to move air. Did I mention it's really shiny?"
4,Fun for the road trips...,"This is an interesting diversion. I mean a trivia quiz book is never going to be a great read, but this is fun. It is especially interesting to take on that road trip to the concert to quiz each other. Or, use it in your local parrot head club to weed out those who just ""wanna-be"" versus those who are!"
2,You will get disapointed.,"I sent this basket for my sister's birthday, and for the amount of money I paid 4 days ago, I could have gotten an amazing basket from one of those 1-800 websites.The quality of the products were really below average. An awkward silence took over the room while the people had these products in their mouth. I feel so bad that this was my birthday present.In top of that, Amazon reduced the price today on $20 dollars, plus they are giving $10 off more as special offer.I'm really disappointed."
4,An Excellent Book For Students,"I am a second year veterinary student. My roommate bought the standard anestesia text-Lumb and Jones and I bought Muir. We both ended up using Muir because it is much more comprehensive at this level then Lumb and Jones (which is an excellent reference but a bit overwhelming for an introductory anesthesia course). In my experience Muir had all the necessary information laid out in an easy to read format, as well as lots of charts which helped to pull everything together."
5,Expose' is a page-turner!,"This Expose' is a page-turner! Tomorrow's headlines today. I found ""Final Reckoning: Mankind's Rendezvous with Eternity"" riveting. The author clearly details and explains mankind's future with current events as told by the Jewish Prophets long ago. Remarkably, these events are occurring before our very eyes. This book is a must read and will leave a lasting mark upon your heart. Everyone needs to read this book."
1,Misrepresented,"I bought this kit from Academy Sports, and it is poorly merchandised and is generally insufficient. The product I got does not resemble the description at Amazon, so it may be some derivative scheme for Academy Sports. The illustration on the box is also deceptive, in that it does not match the contents.It has 3 long rods that screw into a handle, so you could clean a long gun. But the box is labeled ""Pistol Cleaning Kit"", and I don't know of many pistols with a 30"" barrel. Worse, the tips/ends only screw into the last rod, so you cannot use the handled rod with the ends. As another poster pointed out, there are no brushes, so how can this be called a 'kit'?But, you can clean your .22 rifle with their pistol cleaning kit!This is landfill."
4,"Nice supplies, crappy case","The items in the case are great and work perfect, the plastic case they come in suck but hey it was cheap!"
4,"Fast-paced, fun to read, excellent zingers","This is a fun-, fast-paced, well-written amateur sleuth mystery with a heroine who thinks dreadful things about pretentious people. The heroine often deplores Hollywood values, yet is fully part of the L.A. scene herself. It's a very enjoyable book."
2,LIGHT TO NO INK TONER COVERAGE ON 25% OF PAGE,When I first installed it I took out an HP factory cartridge with over 6000 printed pages of usage on it as it was approaching its useful lifespan of approx 7000 pages. The Verbatim replacement cartridge did not produce crisp text nor was the coverage good. Their was blank spots on the printed page which is unacceptable. Tried rocking the cartridge in attempt as instructed to loosen toner with no luck. Took Verbatim replacement cartridge out and put old HP factory cartridge back in and it still works perfectly with crisp print output and no light or missing print output.
1,Christmas in the country,"The visuals are very lovely and calming. However, I had to have a replacement for the first one I received because the sound quality was so bad...the second one is the same way. Too bad because it really would be wonderful if the sound quality wasn't so absolutely awful."
3,nothing spectacular,"I ordered 3 of these, 1 for myself and 2 as gifts for my sisters. Had I watched it before I would not have ordered any. The music is ok but why it is called ""Christmas"" is beyond me. A few of the scenes have an a Christmas overlay [similar to a sticker] in the corner. It is very clear that this is digitally inserted and that the video is simply winter scenes [and not even pretty snow filled scenes] with an overlay. I will keep it simply because of the expense of returning it and for the few wildlife scenes in it. If you want a good snow filled Christmas video to turn down low while entertaining try A Winter Snowfall or any of the Winter Serinity series"
2,The first and one of the weakest of the Monogram entries.,"This is the first of the Monogram Charlie Chan movies and probably one of the worst; they got a tad better as time went on. Take, for instance, ""The Shanghi Cobra."" There is a scene, that you can view on YouTube, from this film that is a real hoot. Charlie leaves a building and goes to another destination, all the while, VERY DRAMATIC MUSIC is playing...nothing happens! All he did was travel! I realize that the budget for the Charlie Chan Films was considerably streamed down when they were produced through the poverty row studio, Monogram. None the less, they are still fun to watch. And if you are a completest of the Chan movies like I am; a must have on your shelf."
2,Cheapest of the cheap Chan's,An inventor of a new weapon is being doggedly protected by government agents. He tells them to back off as they are an insult to his guests. He keeps the plans safe in his pocket. We see ominous eye pears out of the shadows. We know that any minute our scientist will be shot or stabbed. He drops dead. Yep they call in Inspector Jones (Arthur Loft) who in turn calls in Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler).The props look like cardboard and toys. The background music is atrocious as they try to build up suspense and only make you wish this was a silent movie. They must have dug Sidney up from the grave; he is falling apart and his sneer look more like a grimace. The characters are not and you spot the obvious perpetrator.The only mystery is how the inventor died. No fair guessing.Charlie Chan in Meeting at Midnight
2,First Monogram Chan is only fair; try another one first.,"The first of low-budget Monogram Pictures' Charlie Chan mysteries has some flaws, but was successful enough to give the series a new lease on life. Chan investigates the murder of a scientist and the disappearance of secret plans. The film is too stagey; most of the mystery is talked out in ensemble scenes, with a minimum of action. Mantan Moreland (billed second) is a plus, Marianne Quon (as Chan's daughter) is a minus, because she doesn't deliver dialogue convincingly. The underscoring is laughable, with much-too-dramatic music blaring when nothing exciting is happening. The tape's picture and sound are excellent. Okay for Chan fans and B-movie buffs, but if you don't know the Monogram Chans, try ""The Shanghai Cobra"" or ""The Scarlet Clue"" instead."
2,First Monogram Chan is one of the weaker efforts.,"Sidney Toler returns as detective Charlie Chan in this Monogram picture after being dropped from 20th Century Fox in 1942. Monogram was known as the king of the ""B"" movies. This film introduces Benson Fong as Number 3 son, Tommy, and Marianne Quon as Number 2 daughter, Iris. It also introduces the comedian Mantan Moreland who would continue to play the role of Birmingham Brown in most of the Monogram Chan films. Some politically correct types might criticize Moreland as being a black stereotype, but, to me, he adds a refreshing touch of humor to these films. His material in this film is rather weak, but would get better in later films. In one scene, Tommy and Iris start talking to Chan in jive talk. Chan says ""Could please speak English?"" Tommy replies ""Yeah Pop! We're hep cats of the younger generation! You're Confucius. I'm Confucius Jr.!"" The classic Chan line in this film is ""Detective without curiosity like glass eye at keyhole---no good!"""
2,"Too few models featured, illustrated with inferior photos.","This book comes across as being written by an enthusiast, but the illustrations are of the really muddy, dull and just plain dull type. It's okay as far as it goes (if one ignores the photos) but it doesn't go far enough. It is also written from one nation's viewpoint. Collecting cameras actually changes from country to country, and what is just another Argus may be someone's rare collection centrepiece. It's an adequate starting point to get someone collecting cameras, but not of very much use to the more experienced photographic collector."
4,Pretty Cute,Nice DVD with a few options for those who prefer diversity in background imagery. Great for parties! Arrived on-time an in original packaging.
2,"Okay, not great.","These shoes are just okay. There seems to be little sole padding and they are cut small. They almost appear misshapen.I would have sent them back, but I needed something right then, and my old hikers were slipping and sliding. They were on sale, but I would never had bought them at a sporting goods store unless they were at most $15.00."
4,Eden's Crush rules!!,"I love this song and I love the group, and I plan on buying the full-length album. I gave this four stars instead of five, because after a while of listening to the same song over and over, you get pretty bored with it. But I guess it's like that for every song!"
5,"MOVE OVER DREAM, EDEN'S CRUSH IS HERE","Eden's Crush is the final result of the TV show ""Popstars"". Living in Canada and without the WB I have not seen them ... I went out and bought the single ""Get over Yourself"" around a week ago. I could not wait until the album which was released 0n May 1st. The song Get over yourself is a quick snappy song that is one of the greatest girl group songs ever. The key song on the single is the Latin version{too bad it didn't make the album}. Eden's Crush is far superior then ""Sugar Jones"" I bought there single and its not as good as EC. Go out and buy the single and the album. Move over DREAM, EDEN'S CRUSH IS HERE!!!..."
4,Cooool! But Get this...,The album is way cooler. But is you really love eden's crush like i do... than get both & keep in mint. Who knows how much it might be worth. $$$
3,Easy To Get Over,"To be honest, this wasn't as good as I expected; Eden's Crush wasn't as good as I expected. After all of this hype of ""Popstars"" I was expecting something more from this group.Its too early to lose the hope and faith though. We'll have to wait for the album to see if these girls will make it or break it. I hope they do make it because from watching the show, they seem like really sweet, down-to-earth and determined girls. I guess we'll all have to be realistic and say that its all about music.""Get Over Yourself"" is quite catchy and the single is quite interesting, especially with the Spanish version and the phone messages. ""Get Over Yourself"" isn't exactly my favorite song but if your a fan of pop music, then I recommend you to take a listen. You never know, you might like it!"
4,I Love Them!!!,"Eden's crush is the newest hottest act of 2001. They bring you r&B music with some pop feel, so both crowds will enjoy their music. Most of their songs are dance songs made for clubs. They sing real well. I'm waiting on their next one."
5,Great Review,This is a great single! Eden's Crush has so much talent.They don't sound anything like the Spice Girls. Their video for this is great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes pop rock music.
2,Waayyy too cheesy,"Three words: Cheesy and yuck. I don't see what people see in them, this song sucks. But the spanish version isn't too bad."
2,Sounds great after a 12 pack,This album sounds great after drinking a 12 pack. Beer chugging mullet rock all the way. BUURRRP!
1,Dated attempt at a holiday CD,"There are a few decent songs on this album, including a GREAT rendition of Auld Lang Syne by Marc Anthony. There is some kitch and some filler stuff that they used, seemingly to fill space. There are only nine songs on the CD, which hardly makes it worth a purchase. There are definitely better Christmas albums that use contemporary artists, including ""A Very Special Christmas""(2 & 3 are the best).The Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan songs are painful to listen to, simply because of the dumb lyrics. ""Love On Layaway"" for Estefan and ""Ay, Ay, Ay It's Christmas"" for Martin are bad stereotypes of Spanish music. So, with two songs out of nine that are awful, you can do the math and see if it's worth buying."
4,Nice table,"This is a nice, sturdy table. My 15 month old loves it, although she is still working on climbing on and off the chairs. A couple pieces were slightly damaged when we received it, but not worth the hassle of going through with returning them for replacement parts. My only complaint is the table and chairs have a weird chemical smell to them. The smell filled up my daughter's room, so I removed it for a while until it could ""air out."" A week later it still smelled, so I wiped it down with mild soap and water and that seemed to help."
2,Expected more...,"It is no as powerful as a Lightforce or a Warn auxiliary light. Half the cost, though. Looks great in my 4 runner"
3,Good looks but poor material selection..,"I like the looks of the lamp in my SWB Montero plus the blue glass makes it look more aggresive it it only they make them in a metal finish, the plastic housing is fine but I would like the Hella metals. Good ilumination this are pencil style lights . And they add city driving lights too"
1,"I'm trying to help, please read.","it's saterday, june 19, and still have not got any confermation that the gun I orderd is even coming when i orderd this over a month ago. when I resived a pakage from this company thinking it was the gun I orderd, I was wrong. I bought this gun hopping for five stare matirrial and survace, and boy was i wrong with that one.first of they sent me the wrong gun,then they tell me i did not buy the gun I orderd, and i have a resete for it.then they tell me there out of stock, so i ask for my money back, they say no and to wait till more come in.so i waited for my gun and nothing came.so i call them and they said that theyed give me my money back.that arived on time but they were 5 dollairs short.and the stock came in so I thought i could buy it again and mabie it wouldn't happen this time.but now it's $44.95 insted of $24.99 origonaly, not only that but the pic has changed again."
2,"Detailed, personal family history","A great read if you are one of his descendants or are old enough to have known one of the characters in the book. Wentzlaff was a Godly man living a comfortable, affluent life raising his children in Ukrane when he came to the realization that his community was going to have to emmigrate out. The Russians were changing their terms of immigration, Wentzlaff somehow knew they had to get out. He led a large group of young men out to the US to escape the coming Czar's draft. His community was spared the ravages of WWI, WWII, Stalin's purges, and the oppression of the Soviet Union, and the continuing econmic and liberty challenges in that region. How did he know to get out? A big question the book doesn't answer. Which is why I've been searching for the daily diary Wentzlaff kept that is mentioned in this book. If you are a descendant and have any information about the diary, please contact me."
2,Can't read the clock!,"While the space saving feature of this type of clock-radio is great, I am already looking for a replacement. The main issue is the LED numbers are too hard to read. No matter what back-light setting is selected, I can't ever read the clock (either daytime or nighttime; straight-on or at an angle; sleepy or wide awake!). Also it is pretty lightweight, so I have to be careful when picking up the phone because many times I have pulled it right into bed with me! The caller ID, the two separate alarm settings, and the radio tuner are great. Setting the alarm is not very intuitive, so you have to pull out the manual to figure it out, but once learned it is OK. I would rate this higher but as a clock radio where the clock can't be read - I have to only give it a 2-star."
4,"fun, low tech game for many ages","Nice to have a toy that doesn't require batteries, doesn't make noise, and doesn't require reading - many ages can play together, it's very portable, and my 5 and 8 year olds (and their friends) can play for quite some time before wanting to move onto something else.It's sort of the reverse of Pick up Sticks..."
2,Too short Weak plot,I would like to say (not good)........... but since this is a 1996 production and the first of its kind........it can be said as okay although if more thought have been put into characters build up and story expansion then it should be better.Its too short and not that funny........ buy if you are a collector of something which is new in the genre......this is the first but if you are not interested in collecting then go for Tender Loving Care or Point of View.
4,Nice product.,"It is a short DVD, but it is fun to play through to see a different combinations of scenes. Perfect for starting get togethers with your friends of family, even if they only want to check it out for a short time. More fun than the VHS Clue games we have played over the years."
4,I can't believe I am in control!,"If nothing happens in this movie it is because you have directed it that way. This movie is more like a video game than a regular movie. If you want this to be serious forget it, this is pure fun. I have played it 30 times and never had the same action happen twice."
4,I control the story!!,I'm Your Man was the first time EVER that I could actually control the action in a film. While the film plot is not for a rocket scientist it is simple fun entertainment. I have played this Game/Movie about 20 times and it has never been the same twice.
5,Football Widow Turned Model T Car Widow....,"My new hubby has watched this over, and over and over again. I recently married into a family of car NUTZ. All in several car clubs, all with Model Ts. I bought copies of this for all of them for Christmas and they LOVED it, including new Mommy-in-Law. I also showed it to the members of our local HCCA (Horseless Carriage Clubs of America) and they now want to buy it too. This is very well done and informative with a great mix of photos, footage and history of the Model T. Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
1,Same Bad Video as Previously Published,"If I could give this ""No Stars"", I would. Please do not be fooled (like I was) about the publication date being different from the previous History Channel video about Model ""T"". This is the same old DVD with some added commentary from sociologists about Henry Ford - most of it an over-simplification - and the same grainy, ugly, black and white footage of old cars, most of them NOT Model T's. The only thing good I can say about this video is that it's short. Surely with these cars still being so popular as restoration projects, and fun to drive antiques, the time has come for someone to do a realy nice, accurate, good quality video on these great cars?"
5,Excellent!,"What more can I say....if u haven't heard it go out and listen to it. If u like the song... buy the album, it's excellent!"
1,Limited,This book gives you a generalization of 5 Element Acupuncture. Go with something better if you want information more than the bare minimum.
2,An acupuncture student's perspective,"As an acupuncture student, this was the required textbook for my Five Elements class. I was really looking forward to reading the book, but was disappointed. If you're a student and debating whether to buy this book, in my opinion, it's not worth it. This was evidenced by the large number of postings on the school bulletin board after the class of used copies for sale.The writing style tended to meander around without exactly saying anything. There were a lot of quotes from song lyrics circa 1960 and 1970. Personally, I didn't think the Beatles were singing about the Five Elements.That said, if you're really into Five Element acupuncture, it's a worthwhile book to have. There are some good sections on the Officials as well as descriptions of the different elements. However, if Five Element Acupuncture isn't your thing, this book won't convince you that it is."
1,Disappointing,"I'd been looking forward to receiving this book. It's expensive - especially when having to pay shipping, handling and VAT outside of the US - so perhaps I was expecting too much.But the tone is patronising and the information extremely repetitive. Even some of the ""useful forms"" are duplicated.The most essential aspects of gallery management are glossed over, or not mentioned at all, and in addition the text is filled with typographical errors.The book seemed so promising: the chapter headings are logical and appear to offer meaty, meaningful advice - what a pity to find instead that it's all rather vague."
2,not the best book...,A book that is ok to read. I think a little more attention should have been paid to the quotes. The quote on page 5 happened at Parkers crossroads. I spent a few hours looking at all my books and online to make sure. I guess that error early on might have made me look at the book in a unfavorable light. I do like other books in the series though.
3,Just Quotes,"Just about of Quotes taken from Forrest himself, and his allies and enemies alike. A lot of quotes from Sherman."
4,energetic live set with a legend,"The Carolina Chocolate Drops put on an energetic live show, and get an enthusiastic response from the audience when they show up here. The music may be old-timey, but when they are on-stage, it never feels antiquated. The band is not overly polished and comes prepared to party. This is an excellent document of a 2008 appearance at Merlefest. The young string band is joined by the 90-year old legend and inspiration, Joe Thomson, who may be the last fiddler in this class. Although many of the songs can be found on their studio releases, these are unique performances. The set may be a little on the short side, but the nine songs are well-recorded and could be a complete document from this festival."
1,FULL price EMPTY contents,"Another live concert rip-off, disc runs for 30 minutes. This should be a bonus disc to a studio release."
3,"Exhaustive content, unattractive format","This compendium of cryptids (mysterious, rare and unknown animals and creatures) is exhaustive in its treatment of the subject of cryptozoology. Its pages are packed with creatures you've heard of and hundreds more that will probably be new to you. As a tool for those interested in cryptozoology, this is perfect. However, its total lack of pictures or format creativity is obvious, that's why I'm rating the book right down the middle. All in all though, well worth it if you're interested in this topic."
4,Great/durable roomy house- very pretty too!,"My mom and I put this together for my daughter's 5th birthday- now a year and a half later it is still in excellent shape. It didn't take long to put together and was not difficult. The decor (on the walls/floor) are very pretty and my daughter loves the pink exterior. Although you can place it up against a wall to save space, when it is out and accessible from both sides my daughter plays with it a lot more! I would like it if the 'side' rooms were even wider (like the kitchen & bathroom), but in comparison to most dollhouses- it is very spacious and my daughter enjoys it. Good quality, especially for the price. The only thing I noticed is the main floor piece of the 2nd floor (the large bedroom) is coming apart a bit from the pieces that hold it together. So far, no other issues, just this gap. I'm sure a bit of wood glue could fix it... Overall- great house- have yet to see a better one."
3,Warning! Major Assembly Required,"This is a very nice doll house and my daughter enjoys it.However, I would not recommend to those who are not up for a multi - hour assembly project.The instructions are 35 pages (8.5 X 11) and assembly requires 50+ screws.Within my package, two pieces were not appropriately drilled with holes (this was not a problem as I have a power drill and the right sized bit).J."
3,Quality is not as advertised,"My husband I just finished assembling this Christmas present for our daughter. We did a fine and careful job, but it still looks worn out. The room has tiny holes all over it, like tack holes. Some of the paper covering the walls is peeling off the edges of the board. Oh, and my favorite, was when the directions switched the pieces labeled (as in, roof piece 25 and 26 were labeled backwards, not difficult to figure out, but really?).It's for my three year old, it's a great starter dollhouse, but certainly not heirloom quality.FYI - took husband and I an hour and a half to assemble."
4,grandma's gift,This is a beautiful house. It is heavy. My daughter put it together for my granddaughter downstairs. It took two to take it upstairs. I am happy I got it for my granddaughter. She and her friends enjoy many hours playing with it.
3,Meh....,"First of all, this product is NOT ""solid wood"" as the product states...its particle board, plain and simple. It is a very pretty house the rooms are bright and pretty. We constructed the house exactly as the directions stated and some of the seams do not match up also there are gaps between the roof and the actual house if all rooms...they do not sit flush to each other...another problem was that most of the screw holes did not match up, even from the beginning...for the money I feel like it should be a better quality house...don't expect a perfect house if you purchase this, Ill give it a 7.5 out of 10...my daughter loves it and that's all that really matters in the end...I hope it holds up for a few years."
2,Once assembled it looks good!,Assembly was very frustrating! Poor instructions. No lables on the parts. Tightening the screws was hard. Had to screw and unscrew again and again. Ladders can't be screwed as the holes are way off so both the ladders keep falling off. It took almost whole day for two adults to put it together. But once assembled it looked good. And I really wish that it came with couple of dolls and with some if not all the furniture it needs.
2,Misleading description,"When I bought this dollhouse I was under the impression that it comes with furniture, mainly because in the product description it says ""Dollhouse comes with loads and loads of dollhouse furniture for every room (six in all), including a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and baby's nursery.""This is not true!! there is no furniture and no accessories. No I am stuck trying to get some furniture before my grand daughters birthday in 4 days.Very frustrating!"
3,Does the job.,Baby loves the way It feels on her two teeth she has coming in. Not sure if it is really keeping her mouth clean but hey it helps with teething so I would Recommend!!
4,Baby loves,"My baby hated it when I cleaned his teeth (just 6!) with wash clothes and just water. But, with this product, he dose not mind cleaning his teeth at all. It might be the flavor of the toothpaste or rubber toothbrush which he loves to chew. He bites so hard, my finger hurts, though. But, mommy does not mind. :)"
1,MILK ALERGIES BEWARE,The 1 star is for the lack of ingredient listing that states from milk from amazon for informed buyers. It clearly states that it has ingredients from milk. Amazon please list this as a possible allergy on your product description. It's very distressing when you see your newborn and then infant child go through any type of allergic reactions whether mild rash to severe vomiting or even fatal anaphylactic shocks. NO THANK YOU is your new response for any possible triggers. So NO THANK YOU it is.
3,its toothpaste,"I felt like reviewing stuff today, it is toothpaste, it does what it says it does. No issues, overall not a bad by if you have a baby or need a cheap gift."
5,Great for FIRST teeth,"I have a one year old with a few teeth, and wanted to start him on healthy tooth habits with daily cleaning. I tried wiping the teeth with gauze, as recommended in several baby books. He would have none of it. I also tried some of those moist tooth wipes, but they were only a little better tolerated. But this? This works great! He loves when I use it. He's still teething, so he loves to 'chew' on my finger while I rub this around his teeth. No fighting or struggle. (Well, sometimes he cries a bit when I take it away too soon. :) If you're looking for a way to introduce dental health to your child, I recommend you try it."
3,Great except for one big issue...,"Toothpaste tastes fruity and the finger brush works, but if your child sucks too hard on your finger, then I could see this being sucked right down his/her throat. It is small, slippery, and hard to hold onto at times. I would advise to only use this for babies without teeth yet and only need a gum cleaning 1) because they hopefully aren't strong enough to suck it down their throat and 2)If your child bites down, YIKES! no protection provided for that pain, and now you have a hole in your brush."
4,easy cleaning,"Bought this for my 10 month old baby. The toothbrush has soft bristles that wont hurt the baby's gums but will get the job done for the teeth. My baby loved the taste of the toothpaste so that made the job easy as well. My only complaint if at all is that the body of the cleanser could have been a little tougher...my baby likes to bite my finger sometimes and since the cleanser is so soft, she can hurt me. Other than that, happy with the purchase!"
5,Great starter tooth brush!,"My daughter LOVES this thing. It's great for teething, and good to get her into the habit of having her new teeth brushed. I haven't tried the paste yet, but just water and the little brush seem to work pretty well."

3,Practice Makes Perfect,"I'd only heard a few examples of Unity Klan's talent on compilations and one of their songs, ""All I Need"" which I love, but this one was lacking a bit for me. Musically it was great, but I could have used a little more relateable lyrics."
5,Best MMBN game ever,"this game is the best in the series, but alas it is also the last, i have the Japanese version of this game, and it took 50 hours to beat it, i plan on getting the american version also, i loved every minute of it, and i am also getting the Falzar version too"
1,alan taylor,"i thought this dvd lacked the essence of a real fireplace, too much zooming about with the camera and the quality was just not good enough for my plasma. its been put to the bottom of the pile. overall review... not worthy!!"
1,Not The One You'll Look at More Than Once!,"The soundtracks are fine, but if you already own a few CDs, you'll expect more than decent audio on this DVD.But that's about the only thing I can admire about this ""Fireplace"".Extremely dark (very hard to see the ceramic gas ""logs"" that have little pieces of wood pushed in-between them), poorly photographed video that keeps zooming in-and-out (sometimes so far out it's like you're watching from across the room).I haven't received a copy of the 16:9 anamorphic widescreen Plasmavironments Fireplace DVD yet to try, but of the several I have tried, and given out as gifts, The Happy Holiday Hearth (4:3 only) is hands-down the favorite; and this one doesn't even come close."
3,"Solid Heavy Fuzztone, Acidic Psychadelic Rock","If you like your psychadelic rock layered with fuzztone guitars, and dripping with acid and heavy tones - this is a sold roundup of obscure bands and tracks."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This product is awful. Not only is it too big and bulky to stay in a normal cigarette lighter, but it blows fuses out as well. DO NOT BUY IT. If I could give it negative stars I would."
1,Much better books available,"The information is sketchy and factually incorrect in some places, and the book would appear not to have been proof-read - for example the botanical names are mis-spelled in several different ways. There are much better books on the subject available."
5,love this book,A very pleasant book to read. Lots of interesting information about lavender and it's healing powers. It is one of my favorite books.
5,This is a powerful message that needs to get out,"Fit parents should NEVER be court-ordered to stay away from their children. The family court program does just that - forcibly separates fit & loving parents from their children, and then cynically uses the children to ""loot"" them and ""shake them down"" for cash. Family court law operates under the premise of ""this is all in the children's best interests."" The problem is, the powerfull special interests that run family court law only see children as pawns. The court-room does not recognize the fact that children need both fit and loving parents - equally. The court-room has been turned into a corrupt arena that alienates the children from one fit parent (overwhelmingly the father) and then uses the children to plunder and criminialize that parent. If you truly care about what's best for our children then get this movie - and support the cause to get the truth out (to the public) about family court law."
3,Funnier Than Poop ! There I said it.,"Starring: Joe Estevez, Felissa Rose and Brinke Stevens.This reminded me of those `Don Knotts & Tim Conway' comedies of the '80 s,Well its more like Chuck McCann and Don Knotts style of fun on film.The cameos are spread out and alot of fun,We remember a time,When b-movie cameos were wasted in VCR fodder; Not anymore Joe Estevez again in a month has some very funny lines and Felissa Rose & Brinke Stevens have alot of stuff to convey to their audience.The plot of script is very clever and has alot of jokes about Charlie Sheen, Sleepaway Camp, and Gore Humor,Yeah, Gore Humor.There is hints this two fellows are going to make a series of horror-comedies,Please Do,We say.Now,You're probably not going Camping,Counseling or seeing 3D after this C & O effort,Anytime soon or email us as a dare completed, IF YOU CAN !!!"
1,This is SO BAD,"The title does not apply to this, DO NOT WATCH is just to off the wall. Had to shut off half way thru..just could not stand any longer..."
3,Good for back up battery,Works just as it was advertised....batter life of these tools aren't the greatestso it pays to have a few back ups for those longer jobs.
4,Diary of a hitman,Stunning performances by Sherilyn Fenn and Forest Whitaker. One of those overlooked gems that you see and it never leaves your mind. That is why after so many years after a chance rental and its absence from TV showings I had to purchase it.
5,Answer: The Kinison,"Out of what, in my opinion, is the next ""big thing"" in the alt-rock music scene, comes The Kinison. First get their EP ""Mortgage is Bank"" it kills. This CD is amazing. Sort of like At the Drive In with more of an ""Indy"" vibe. Really, really f-ing good, I just wish I could see them live. Stand out tracks: The Farm & the Girls, Wild and Crazy Kids, American Collectibles, and Oh Boy That Girl Can Move. So when this kind of music becomes the next screamo, just know that the Kinison have been here for a while."
2,What?,"Granted, this album has some good hooks and is pretty upbeat, but how could you give it 5 stars? Whoever this vocalist is should realize that he lacks a quality scream-o voice. The best track here is ""You'll never guess who died"" because of the catchy guitar riff and good vocals. Everything else just seems... too planned. The screams lack passion, the lyrics are silly, and the attempt to marry pop with hardcore is nauseating. There is no doubt that these guys have talent, but this album (and their hardcore approach altogether) doesn't convey it. Save your 5 star ratings for Led Zeppelin II or Disintegration. Oh, and the reviewer who says this album has groovy 80's inspired hooks is probably on acid."
2,THE BEST COMEDY!,"I have heard many CDs before where the artists are not original but this one was hilarious! It was so bad it made me laugh for almost 15 minutes straight. Whatever you do, DO NOT waist your money on this CD! Only buy this CD if you are in a mood for a good laugh. I gave it an extra star for making me laugh so hard."
2,Very Poor Choices,"Well, lets see, I didn't like the songs it chose as the ""top ten"" and the ones they did pick sounded like they were recorded off of an old record or something. It didn't sound like how those songs sound on the radio at all. Over all a very poor collection. Lets set our standards a little bit higher guys."
3,ok cd but where's the plot,"Every cd should have a plot. Well...Totally Hits 2002-The plot is hits.Now That's What I Call Music!-It's what u call music.Shrek Soundtrack-Music from the motion picture Shrek.(duh)Top 10 Now-Well... is top the plot? is 10 the plot? is now tne plot? NO. Well,the only idea of plot is the cd is top 10 music. But wait,it's not top 10 music so...Why did they make it?Is it a series?What is the plot?Where did the songs come from?Maybe from the billboard 3 years ago?If u know the questions than GOOD! You know the plot,but u must be pretty smart too know the plot.i hope this helped"
1,Like a karaoke party in your living room!,Too bad none of the guests can sing. I think this is a joke...
5,Hohner makes a fine harmonica,"Hohner makes a fine harmnica in their Meisterklasse models.I have them in keys of G, A, and D, and am saving to add additional keys.The curve and weight are, compared to the Blues Harp and Special 20 case styles, much more comfortable in my hands.The way the cover plates fit the holes and the slight texture to the ridge between makes these harmonicas especially comfortable for tongue blocking.For playing by pucker, and I play that way as well, it is easy to get a good seal on the individual notes.However I don't find the reeds are any easier to bend than the other models of Hohner diatonic harmonicas. If you play a lot of bent notes you may want to tweak the reeds and gaps or ahve them tweaked for you by one of the customizers.They have a nice bright tone but their one defect is they take a while to warm up; they play better if they are first warmed in a shirt pocket."
2,Doesn't collect hair properly,"My cat was put off by this; he didn't seem to enjoy it at all, and got bored with it as a toy, too. I also tried it on my dog, and she liked it even though she's very finicky about brushing, but most of the hair it loosened just fell on the ground or clumped up; not much collected in the brush."
4,Noahs Ark,A delightful video for children (and adults) of all ages. Artfully done and easily explainable to all. I highly recommend this video for introducing children to Biblical stories and for refreshing memories of those who already know the story.
5,Excellent!,"My grandson (2 years old) watches this movie over and over! He will say, ""Watch Noah! Watch Noah!"" I purchased a second DVD to have at his home, and he watches it there over and over too! I highly recommend this Noah DVD."
3,Biblical anime,"... It's biblical anime, characters seem unenthusiastic. This version just tells the story motion by motion. Maybe my daughter was having a weird moment but my husband and I couldn't figure out if the illustration was too bright for her eyes or if she was having a notorious eplieptic seizure from seeing too much anime."
3,Shipment error by UPS does not look good for Amazon.com,"I ordered this textbook set on August 12, and after seeing it went past my house after making a stop in New Jersey, UPS had this text travel north of my house before making its final destination at my home three days later. This appears to be what I need but the time it took to get it did not seem worth it."
3,"Very Dated - Good for Historiography, Not Much Else","I though I would enjoy this book, since I have an MA in the Intellectual and Scientific History of Europe and alchemy has always been interesting to me. I found it frustrating, more than anything else. While this version was published within living memory, the original book was written in 1957 and it has not been updated. As with most history texts written before the 70s, it is filled with myths presented as fact, pronounced prejudices, and blatantly false information. If the book is read as a history of how alchemy has been viewed in the early twentieth century, it stands up very well, but it is not useful for anyone who wants to know the true history of the subject."
4,Jack Nicklaus,"This book really tells you nothing new or spectacular, but it does help and does have some good illustrations."
3,Best for high schoolers,"I am a graduate student and I found this book to be too remedial for myself. I think it would be great for high school aged students. There were some useful reminders and tips, but this nearly 300 page text could be reduced to twenty. The APA formatting chapter is already outdated (I don't know about the correctness of the MLA or CMS standards). I do like the for Dummies/Idiots line of books, but for me, for this subject matter, it was not instructive enough. Next on my reading agenda is ""The Craft of Research"" by Booth, Colomb, and Williams, and ""Methods in Psychological Research"" by Evans and Rooney."
5,The beauty of simplicity,"Like another reviewer, I first saw this through a rental copy from Netflix. It is repetitious chanting by three young men with a little bit of video from Ireland interspersed. The prayer chants come from the distant past and are beautiful in their simplicity. They hail back to the ancient monasteries and people in early Christian times. The scene is effectively set without artificial lighting. Accompanying musical sounds and basic acoustics deepen the experience. If you are familiar with other chant music and how it can lower blood pressure and induce a state of relaxation, then you already have an idea of what ""The Irish Prayers"" is like. What I can say further is that it is all of this and more. This is one of those rare items that I will give as gifts."
2,Part and Service Not Given as Advertised,"This is a cheap, generic knockoff of the Dell item. The picture shows Dell but the one I received wasn't. I compared this one and the Dell original and it is different in size at the connection. It works but it doesn't fit snugly. As far as the seller, I ordered this on a Thursday, paid for Expedited Shipping, and it finally arrived via regular mail 5 days after I ordered it (b/c of the weekend and a holiday). I was hoping it would arrive via FedEx or UPS since I paid for Expedited and wanted it delivered either on a Saturday or the President's Day holiday. Lastly, I wish there was a status on my order and a tracking number."
2,incompatible connector,the power adapter came with a 3-wire connector that didn't match the normal laptop input jack. I had to buy a separate plug and solder it to the cord after cutting off that 3-wire connector.
1,All that glitters is not gold,"Was very pleased at first but the pin (the part that goes into the port at the back of the laptop) was broken within a month. Can I have a replacement? If not, then my purchase was in vain."
4,"great delivery time, fair product","I am pleased that I received the product pretty quickly. Although, I wish the power cord was longer. but it works!"
1,Not good for me,"The plug that goes into the laptop was loose and would fall out easily. I put a piece of shrink tube on it to cure that. The power pack itself malfunctioned in a couple of weeks giving out irregular voltages. I stopped using it for fear it would cause irreparable damage to my laptop. The old adage applies, you get what you pay for, this was a cheap no brand replacement and was a waste of money. I ended up buying another replacement direct from Dell."
1,"15 days without computer, because I order parts from Northparts.","Took 15 Days to get my order , Paid extra $$$$ for expedite Shippping. 15 days without computer!!!!!.Because I order parts from Northparts. Placed order on 05-02-08, shipped 05-11-08(9 days),received 05-17-08 (15 days after order was placed, 3 day passed promised date. I never useed, my wife purphased one from local best buy after waited for 14 days she could not live without computer. Will not buy again. Should not be in high tech bussiness. Took 9 days after ordered was placed to shipped !!!! ."
4,Dynamic singing from Al Martino,"This 24 track CD reissues the first two albums Al recorded for Capitol - ""The Exciting Voice of"" and ""The Italian Voice of"". His singing on these two albums is very much in the style of his work in the 1950's. This album contains classic songs like ""Granada"", ""Mattinata"" and ""The Loveliest Night of The Year"" along with over a dozen songs sung in Italian. If you are expecting the Al Martino of ""I Love You Because"" and ""Painted, Tainted Rose"" you won't find those type of songs here. Starting with his third album, he changed his style to turn out the hits that he is so well known for in the early to mid 60's. If you enjoy this dramatic style of singing or you like good Italian songs, this CD may please. On the other hand, if you are looking for the ""hit"" sound of Al Martino you might want to make another selection."
4,Light as a feather and utterly charming,"What is now called ""sunshine pop"" was one of the delights of AM radio in the late 1960s. The Mamas and the Papas, Spanky and Our Gang, The Cowsills and, of course, the Peppermint Rainbow were leaders of this pack.Catchy tunes influenced by folk, pop and the softer sort of rock, production that was very stylish for the day, and layer upon layer of harmony vocals - that was the essence of sunshine pop. It's all as insubstantial as cotton candy and just as much fun. For me it brings back memories of my earliest teens, before I got into serious rock 'n' roll.I am amazed that this is on CD. I looked for the LP for years before finding a mint copy in a local record store for $12.Great good fun for anyone who grew up with their ears glued to AM radio back in the day."
5,Glad I prchased this!,"I have really enjoyed listening to the Peppermint Rainbow for many years. This CD contains a lot of good music. I especially like ""Walking in Different Circles"". This CD is getting harder and harder to find. Get it while you can."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this cd strictly for the song ""Will You Be Staying After Sunday"". After the song ends, there is a minute of weird music that doesn't go with the tune at all and was not the version that received radio airplay. The rest of the tracks are marginal. I wanted to rip the song to make a cd of my favorite music, but the end of the track just ruins the song. Hopefully one day the original tune that received airplay will be available."
1,The Only Book I've ever Returned,"I'm a big fan of Thomas Szasz; I enjoy the work of Peter Breggin; I am certainly a critic of modern psychiatry, the pathologizing of behavior, and labeling. HOWEVER, this is not a good book.If there is a good book out there on the DSM, I would like to read it. This just isn't it.For instance, there are a couple good points regarding Borderline Personality Disorder. However, it is buried in a chapter that attempts to assert that BPD was invented to free therapists from responsibility when they have sex with their patients.Mostly, I just kept thinking ""SO?"" or ""What's the point? "". I'm a psychiatric social worker, I use the DSM frequently, and I don't like it.I would like to read a well-written book on the subject.This just ISN'T it."
5,I Love Gwen!,"This DVD is one of the best that Gwen Stefani has done, I love to see her on tour by her self! she is the greates... Great DVD...a must have..."
2,Ummm...,"First of all, I LOVE Gwen Stefani.But this DVD is pretty awful. She (Gwen) sounds COMPLETELY different in concert then on her cd's. I was expecting to hear a bit of a difference, I mean, it would be nearly impossible to sing perfectly while you are dancing around in (super sexy) costumes and high heels, but this is just ridiculous. She sounds like a completely different person- one whose singing is, in my opinion, terrible."
2,Audio Sucks,Waited for this and expected it to be a top class production. But what a waste....I can't understand how musicians can release a DVD that sounds this bad. Seems a rushed production and more of a money spinner than a quality product.
2,I LOVE HER BUT... SHE SUX AT CONCERTS,"I was looking forward to cool sets and good fun but NO....1st SHE CAN""T SING IN CONCERT!!!She sounds like a guyTHE SETS are CHEAP and mostly video screens...I LOVE HER AND HAVE ALL HER CDs BUT NOOOOO I WILL NEVER GO TO HER CONCERT"
1,Vain as can be!,"Gwen Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Live DVD is great for anyone who likes bad audio, horrible live singing, and crappy pop music. Gwen can't sing, can't dance, her videos are just another way for her to flash her obsessive and self-centered face across our t.v. screens. If you want to bored for 2 hours then by all means purchase this piece of over-polished junk!"
5,Gwen's Tour Was Awesome!,"I saw Gwen at Madison Square Garden with Ciara and she put on one of the best visual displays I have ever seen at a concert! The whole place literally shook when she played Hollaback Girl (the highlight of the performance) and the energy that she and her dancers gave was unreal. She had some really great things to say about New York and I remember her saying something along the lines of ""Since you keep buying so many of my records I have to keep making them.""I was also amazed at how fast between numbers she was able to change costumes and the show kept screaming for more. The only downside to the performance was I was hoping she would have thrown in one or two of her No Doubt numbers (Don't Speak especially) but she only performed her numbers from the Love Angel Baby CD."
1,Gawd,"Just saying J.T. exists doesn't make it so, especially since it isn't true. I know the person and people perpetuating this hoax, and there isn't a single real J.T. Leroy in the bunch. No amount of wishing or saying otherwise will change that. By this time next year the debate and speculation will be mostly over, and J.T. will be no more than a sad idea that did itself in by a miscalculated desire to continue fooling people in the face of an unwinding and undeniable truth."
1,Laura Does the Publishing Industry,"After learning more about the back-story of the JT Leroy scam, I went out and dig through more garage sales and found ""his"" other work. My conclusion is; the writing is anything BUT amazing or profound. I realized what made these JT Leroy books barely digestible is that Laura Albert actually managed to con these established writers into helping her edit her books. I think by now, all is in agreement that this Laura Albert person is a sociopath after the New York Times outing. The truth indeed is stranger than fiction. Someone should write about how Laura con the publishing industry, it would make a best seller."
5,Please,"JT LeRoy exists. He has many, many famous friends who have verified his existence. No amount of lazy journalism can erase someone's identity and existence. Go read his books. They are wonderful. Don't believe the lies."

4,Joseph (part of Testament-The Bible in Animation),"This is a fine rendering of the Biblical tale of Joseph the Patriach. Despite an initial feeling that puppets would be ""corny"" or whatever, the result certainly transcends such expectations.It brings the story to life with sensitivity and even a little humour, and with very few omissions or (probable) errors. The voices, in particular, are very vivid (note that they're British/Welsh accent however), conveying very real feeling. And even the costumes and sets, albeit with puppets, are actually quite impressive.The only critisism is that the whole show is over far too quickly, to fit into a 1/2 hour time slot. It's a shame to abridge it, with 3 or the 4 scenes shown as photos on the clamshell cover not even in the production...But overall it's a fine result, worthy of the story involved."
2,If you like The Beastie Boys . . .,"OK, I am not a big Beastie Boys fan, and this album (""Greatest"" Remixes) reminds me of their style - loud, brash, unmelodic, hardcore. I couldn't listen to two tracks in a row without popping out the CD. I would've given this CD only one star, but I realize that it might be suitable for some people who liked that ""Insane in the Membrane"" sound I thought we got rid of a few years ago. As a note, I do have and enjoy ""The Norman Cook/Fatboy Collection"" and ""Live from the Big Beat Boutique."" Both of those CDs have some variety. This one is just loud and brash all the way through."
2,One of a long line of rehashes,"I can't see anyone justify these as his greatest anything. His studio work clearly outshines most of the mixes here. There are no fewer than three Fatboy Slim collections released in the last year, including this one and Hip-O Records' ""Fatboy Slim/Norman Cook Collection"". Both strike me as minor-label attempts to make a quick buck on a big star. If you want a primer, get Better Living Through Technology. If you want a greatest-hits album, wait until he compiles one, rather than settling for this."
4,"if u liked his last CD, get this one.","Fatboy Slim's mixture of intricate drumming, hip-hop and a touch of disco often does work on this compilation. The best way to listen to this CD is to dance to it; some tracks are kinda hard just to chill to."
5,Superdabbathumpinatcha,"Essential Norman Fatboy Cook! My only complaint is that the CD is too short. Wildchild's Renigade Master and Psychedeliasmith's Dubby Jointy stand out to me and, like all the rest, are rendered anew and fully awash in primal Cook infectious layered aural candy. That funny sound? It's your music collection slowly dying for lack of this choice cut of CD steak."
2,Hmph,"I read about Glenn Branca before I ever listened to his music. It sounded from the description like it would be great, a massed group of guitarists hammering away to achieve a big sound, but the album itself (this one) was a phenomenal let-down. The much-vaunted noise is peculiarly ethereal and gutless, which may have been the effect intended, but which I can't help regarding as a ridiculous thing to get a load of electric guitarists together to produce. Truly creative musician like Sonny Sharrock or Fred Frith have made more fearsome rackets playing solo, than Branca can coax out of his army of solemn axemen. Save your money."
2,Starts standing,2 1/2More rhythmic dissonance startlingly transcends self-absorbed methodical confines in greater moments of harmonic searching.
4,Scottish horror,"I love horror movies, but especially Scottish horror (love the accents). This story centers around coming-of-age teens dropped off by the priest in their youth group on a camping trip, only to find out that the beautiful countryside is infested with strange, hairy beasts (and it's not the sheep). I liked the way the movie introduced us to the characters first and helped us care about them before killing anybody off. I was slightly disappointed in the look of the beast, but they did well for their budget. Not a 'top notch' horror, but still entertaining.Chrissy K. McVay"
3,"Good Movie Without A Big, Bad Wolf","If I have said it once , I have said it a thousand times. If a movie is going to be a movie, then it should be at least an hour and twenty-five minutes long. This was a really good movie, but I could not see most of the action done in the dark. There are ways to alleviate this problem. I have seen it in other movies, like green screening the night. The monsters could have been a bit better , instead of looking like an actor covered in a shaggy rug. Other special effects were good, like when the wolves took bits out of their victims. The story was a good one though. I do not regret buying this one, although the accents were too sharp many times. Good for what I paid for it."
3,WILD COUNTRY,The story line was good. When the action started it was difficult to understand what was being said due to the Irish accents. The creature was very disappointing...laughable. They could have done better.
2,Single handedly sunk by corny monster costume,"I like the sense of place in this film, but once the monsters actually show up, you can't help but see it's someone in a costume. Very silly, fake looking. This is a renter, not a keeper for your DVD shelf."
3,relatively small in size,"my wife love the style and cutting, however the size is relative small even for a petite Asian. the material is excellent."
5,Really Loving it!,Love the Babydoll set. True to the size. Most teddy don't fit well but this one is the one. Very comfortable. I wish I could get it in more colors
2,Ehhhh.......,"After reading the reviews, we had mixed opinions about the item but we decided t purchase anyway. The sizing was way off. We even ordered a larger item to get over the issue of the cup size being too small from what other reviews stated...still didn't fit. We had to return the item because there was no way my wife was getting into it and she is by far not large at all."
3,"Really cute, maybe not the best for ""top heavy"" gals","This is a really cute set. The fabric is really soft, not clingy , and not too transparent, so it covers up that tummy area we all want to hide! The panties are nice, with a little pink ruffle in the back that you can see through the slit in the back of the top. I am 205lbs and the 3X fit perfectly. Unfortunately, I will be returning mine, the strap broke when I tried it on, which I don't think was the garments fault... I'm a heavy 40DDD, a bit too heavy for the thin straps to handle! I did really like it other than that, I will reorder the same item sometime in the future when I lose a bit of weight!"
3,big,I like the outfit. The top fits good but the panties that come with it are just HUGE! And I got a medium! They look like they are an xlarge!
3,Interesting Book,"I bought the book because it was recommended by the book club at my synagogue. While the book is interesting, Mr. Epstein make huge leaps in conclusions. Some of what he says appears to have been pulled out of thin air. I would not read it again."
3,"less history, more laughs","I thought this book would be more entertaining. It's a bit too pedantic for my taste. I was hoping it would be funnier. More laughs, less history, please."
5,make sure you have access to a press,"Product works great. The big issue is getting the old bushings out. Ford uses a spherical bearing in the OE swaybar links. They only press out in one direction because there is a lip on the bearing. If they have a few miles on them (why would you replace them if they are new?) they will be hard to press out. A hydraulic press is almost mandatory. Once they are pressed out the installation of the new ones is a snap. This got rid of an annoying clunk in the front end, and was much cheaper than buying new OE style swaybar links."
1,The Cat Who Can't,"I loved this series -- once upon a time. . However the last few books have been long on character study but very short on mystery. . This book was so disappointing that I can't recommend it at all. . When I want to visit with Koko and Yum Yum again, I'll reread their earlier adventures."
2,this book should be in the litter box,"Ms. Braun's books are often entertaining. This one is only mildly entertaining at best and goes off on too many topics that do not advance the plot at all. In fact the plot can be summarized in about 3 sentences. If one were to take out the kitty auction, the sections on food, what Q's girlfriend is wearing down to her thin silky scarf, this book would be about 40 pages long! This has got to be the worst in the series that she has done. Hopefully she'll get her writer's block removed by next winter's book. This book was definitely written on autopilot."
1,Cat Who IS a Bomb!,"I am sorry to say that I will NOT be buying the next book in Lilian Jackson Braun's ""Cat Who""series. And that is saying alot, since I am one of those readers that pre-orders all the hardcovers from my favorite authors. This book was terrible! Trite, poorly plotted and with no tying up of loose ends WHATSOEVER at the end of the book. It left me wondering if they had made a mistake and left out a Chapter or two. I have truly enjoyed this simply written and fun series up until the last two books, but now this needs to STOP! Please lay it to rest , Ms. Braun, before you embarass yourself further."
1,NOT what it used to be,"Was there even a mystery in this book? The last three I've found Ms. Brown losing her mind and senility and especially her writing finesse. All that was talked about was practically a few days in Qwill's life and mindless drivel you might read in a newspaper. As soon as Koko acted strangly, that was it; mystery over in chapter 4. It was a 2 hour read, no miss on solving the mystery myself, and tragidies that were completely unnecessary. I'm just going to imagine my own next few stories to make myself happier because this and the other last two were wastes of my time/money."
2,Ghost writer???????????????,"I am an avid reader of the CAT WHO, but am very disappointed in the last two books. They are very disjointed and rambling. Up until these books, I could not put a book down until I was finished. Now it is all I can do to finish the book. I will not pay the price for the hardcover, wait for the paperbook. i hopeBraun is looking at some of these comments............"
3,Ending Left me Wanting Closure,Ms. Braun usually ties up the crime a bit better than she did in this installment of The Cat Who series. I was left wanting more closure after finishing the novel.
3,Braun is getting older,"Although I have enjoyed most of Lilian Jackson Braun's books concerning James Qwilleran and the great cats, CoCo and YumYum, it seems that the last couple of offerings, including ""Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell"" are meandering more and fail to bring the plot line to a satisfactory conclusion. Plot items are left unexplained or unsolved and the speed of the story line is slowing down noticably. I confess that I'm hooked on the characters, but if I weren't, I'd probably pass on the last two or three of Lilian's efforts. One gets the impression that the publisher keeps bugging her for more, knowing that past successes will guarantee a profit. Sorry, Lilian."
1,Why did I waste my time?,"I promised myself, after reading LJB's last ""Cat Who..."" book, that I wouldn't read another. Alas, I was weak, & the book, printed in unusually large type on heavy paper to give it weight & substance, was a quick read, albeit a waste of my time. (If you must read this book, borrow it from the library; it's not worth your hard-earned money.) A synopsis is provided by many prior reviewers, so I will just add that there was NO plot, NO character development, NO MYSTERY! I couldn't even cozy up to Qwill's cats this time around. EVERYBODY seemed one-dimensional & uninteresting. The auctions could have been made into so much more, but they, like every other event in the book, were just glossed over, some even thrown in for no reason that I could fathom. It's definitely time to put the pen down, Ms. Braun!"
5,"This is a great inclusion into the whole series, which I now have on hand.","Having read this series in its entirety several years ago, all I remember is admiring the writing and the stories and the way they added to each other and complemented the whole."
3,The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell,"""The Cat Who"" Books a great comfort reads.I have read these books before but enjoy re-reading them.Qwill, KoKO and YumYum and wonderful characters and will missnot having new novels in years to come. But will enjoy all theold ones.SDB"
3,For cat lovers,"Out of the three I have read/listed to so far this is my least favourite. I would say that if you are not a cat fan it would be a 2 star. The series are great if you want a quick read without getting a too indepth story line.Mr Q and his cats KoKo and YumYum are up to it again, with the introduction of new characters and their cats. One of my favorite sections would be the description of Maggie, an older resident of Moose County, sitting at her formal dinning table with her five cats, each cat on one of the chairs, I can see this being me in another 50 years! There is definately not as much mystery to this one, with a crime not occurring untill a good 2/3 into the story and there is no real suspense or real answers given to it at all.Definately not for those who want a sophisticated read, but perfect for those who want to be able pick up and put down the book without getting caught up in details"
2,Milquetoast offering,"Not a lot to say about this offering. I read these books (meaning 'the cat who...' series) as I go along and as they go, there are far more engrossing books in this series than this one. Not that it's a particularly awful book, it isn't. But for a 'mystery' book series, there is very little mystery here. There are a couple of 'minor mysteries' here, and literally neither are solved by Quill or the cats. The whole book just kind of reads like a soap opera diary of some social events that happen in the town of Hatchet and that's all. Pretty dull reading here. I'd avoid this volume unless you want bragging rights to having read all of the books in the series."
2,Qwilleran is great,"Amateur feline sleuths KoKo and YumYum again help reporter Qwilleran solve the mystery. This time, the Town of Pickax is on the verge of its 150th anniversary. Polly, Qwill's amore, has moved from Head Librarian to Manager of The Pirates' Chest, a bookstore financed largely through the K-Fund which came from Qwill's unexpected inheritance.A large part of Braun's success is a reader's enchantment with Qwill, his two cats and his community. After an architect student sketches the interior of Qwill's apple barn home, a murder takes place at a family reunion. Qwill and his Siamese cats put together their senses to find out the who and why. The mystery plays a small part of this novel but it is fun to revisit the world created by Braun."
4,Disappointed,"Tink the author is getting tired of writing these books. I have read all the Cat Who, books and enjoyed all, until this one."
1,Bombshell? More of a misfire...,"Don't buy it-- get it from the library- read it in two hours, then take it back.The book is as disappointing to fans as the rest of the recent installments in the series were. We used to look forward to reading the newest ""Cat WHo"" book as soon as it came out-- now it seems like there's not even much of a waiting list for the library's copy!"
3,Ms. Braun is still alive!,"Ms. Braun (according to Wikipedia) is still alive. Her birthdate is listed as 1913. I agree her books seem to be getting worse rather than better. But I love the characters...all of them. They are like warm friends to some of us fans. So I read them and have them in my two middle school libraries for students and their parents. The kids like them and seem less critical of them than adults.If you do not like the new Cat Who books, I would suggest you go on to another series..or re-read the beginning ones."
4,delightful romp,"Lilian Braun is the master (or should I say mistress?) of portraying delightfully eccentric characters living in a society which ridicules none, accepts all, and uses their talents. Her detective Qwilleran is certainly eccentric. The various personalities she develops for her many cat characters are equally fun and adeptly presented. Sometimes, as in this story, she kills off characters I would prefer her to retain for development in later books. While other reviewers distinguish among various of her plots, seeing some as superior to others, I find the mastership of eccentricity so engaging that it is far more important to me than actual plot considerations, which I will not comment on in order to leave readers with the utmost in anticipation and curiosity. Her setting, which makes me think of upstate Minnesota or Michigan and Garrison Keeler, is also masterfully crafted in every book."
1,The worst,"I had read the other reviews before I read this book and they were so correct. This was the most rambly, choppy, no depth book I have every read. I have all the Cat Who books and this one made me sad and mad. No interaction with the cats, no loving banter with Polly. No sadness over important people in Quills life. I have the next one and hope it will be better. I have read all the others no less than 3 times and have them set aside for my cat loving granddaughter someday, but this book won't get a second read. SAD SAD"
3,Good but not great!,"I liked this book well enough to give it to my mother to read, but like many of the other people who have reviewed this book, I found that this story lacked a lot of what we have come to expect of the series, but still was able to enjoy it.The last few books haven't had the pizazz of the original storylines, but that hasn't prevented me from being able to take a hot bath and soak and enjoy my reading.However, this might be a diappointment to someone who is looking for more in the way of meat in a story, but as a comfort read, it definately serves its purpose."
1,Avoid this installment,"Even though this is a short book, there's plenty of repetition of mundane details about goings on in Moose County. I remember when Qwill actually took the time to investigate murders instead of just waiting for a letter from a friend of a friend to arrive and tell him who done it (and how and when). There's one possible murder in this book that never gets solved, but maybe the letter for that one got delayed and will show up in the next book in the series, which I don't plan to read."
4,"Not a Mystery, But a Quaint, Relaxing Small-Town ""Cozy""","According to her publisher's website, Ms. Braun was born in 1916, which means she is 90 years old this year. Her later novels, including this one, are very different from her earlier mysteries. Somewhere along the way she stopped writing actual mystery novels and started writing home-town ""cozies"" that follow the lives of Qwill and other characters we've gotten to know in previous novels. I didn't approach this book expecting a hardcore mystery (look to Hard Case Crime for excellent examples of those) but a quaint, relaxing read about cat-lovers in a small town like Mitford (without the theology) or Lake Wobegon (without the humor). I wasn't disappointed; this was indeed a quaint, relaxing read. Nothing more, nothing less."
3,Still charming,"It's obvious that the most recent books in the series have been far below the level of excellence achieved by previous ones, but I still enjoy taking a journey to Moose County, if only because the characters are old friends. But seriously, give the woman a break. She is 90 years old (she was born in 1916 so she is not over 100 as some have said and she IS still alive) and the fact that she is still writing is most impressive. Don't read these last books if you are looking for a thrilling mystery, read them for a charming story and relaxing times with familiar characters."
1,It May Be Time to Retire Koko,"The ""Cat Who"" mysteries are definitely petering out. The last few have been mere shadows of their former selves. While evacuated for Hurricane Katrina, I reread all of them and it was very evident how superior the older entries were. I love Quill and the cats, but it makes me sad to see something of this poor quality on the shelf. Let them go with dignity - they deserve it!"
1,"**Yawn** Oops, I guess I was reading that....","As many others, I have been reading this series for years and have enjoyed doing so. This book seems to have lost its stuffing. Usually devoting hours to reading a book, I spent hardly any time at all with this one, leaving me with time to cook supper, do the laundry, wash dishes, and yes, clean the litter boxes.How does it happen that Homer Tibbett dies and only three words are spoken about it? There is no actual storyline, even when there is murder afoot. Understanding how gutsy ""Koko"" is, I'm surprised he didn't pounce on ""Qwill"" trying to get him out of this comfortable, middle-aged rut and contribute to the story.I will read the next book (glutton for punishment, I guess) in hope that it will actually have a storyline. As for the author, being able to write into one's 90s is quite a feat, but all of these years should have taught her the mystery formula..."
1,The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell,"Alas, I must concur with previous reviewers. As yet another Moose County vicarious resident, I was looking forward to the latest escapades of Quill, Koko and Yum Yum. I was hoping for Koko's latest psychic quirk, Yum Yum's latest pilfer, and Quill's latest romantic caper with Polly -- IN DETAIL! The details, along with Braun's wonderful subtle humor, are what have made this series such a success. When I need to escape, I reread one of the books and escape to Pickax. Hithertofore we've gotten wonderful descriptions of what people wear, what people eat, little running gags between characters -- oh, and that wonderful thing called ""character development."" I don't mind ghostwriters -- so long as they have blood in their veins, passion in their prose, and know their subject. An excellent editor helps, too. Lilian Jackson Braun has created too wonderful a series to have it bomb like this."
1,One for the litter box,"I enjoyed the first several books in the series, but ""The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell"" was absolute dreck... I couldn't read more than 1-2 pages at a time without looking for other more stimulating ways to occupy my time (watching paint dry, counting how many times I blink per minute, etc.). Unless the next book is titled, ""The Cats Who Killed (Then Devoured) Jim Qwilleran"" I will not return to this series."
1,Thanks for the Memories but Enough is Enough,"I'm confused by those who rated this book 4 and 5 stars. Did we read the same book? Have you read her earlier books? There is no comparison. I've been dissatisfied with the last 4 entries. I will not be buying any more books nor will I waste my time reading them. I will however re-read the excellent earlier stories. Thanks Lilian, I'll miss you."
5,Cat Who..............Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""Cat Who..."" books are the best!!!! Each book is like returning home to old friends and family. Our entire family wait for each book (we do audio books) with anticipation and are never disappointed."
4,STAY ALIVE FOREVER,I ENJOYED THIS VISIT WITH THE WHO GANG AS MUCH AS THE FIRST. I WHISH LILIAN COULD LIVE FOREVER.
4,How to live with The Cat Who...does it all,"Once upon a time, I was owned by two Siamese cats, and quickly came to sympathize with Quill - you will find no two Siamese are the same. Neither of my ""owners"" were quite as spunky as KoKo, but living with them gave me many years of enjoyment. As I usually try to read a chapter a night before bed, we quickly developed the habit of reading chapters from The Cat Who series out loud, and both enjoyed the together time (or faked it real good) This book was not as great as Mrs. Braun's usual offerings, or perhaps it was because I could not share it with my two - but still I enjoyed my trip to Pickax and look forward to my next visit."
3,NOT a Bomb,"Lillian Jackson Braun has come thru again. Her books are so enjoyable and relaxing. Sure, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out ""who done it"" but then every once in a while is kinda nice to escape into the world of Koko, Yum Yum and ""Quill"". Just like old friends you like to visit very often. I'm eagerly waiting their next adventure."
3,The Cat Who got a little boring....,"I have always enjoyed the Cat Who series and have read them all. However, I found this one lacking in substance and a bit boring. I was dissappointed."
2,Comforting but no real mystery,"The last two books have been disappointing. The book was fluff and lacked the real attention to the two sub-plots - the murder of a long time character and two other new characters that were described the same way throughout the entire book. The old Qwill would have intervened and actually tried to visit the ailing couple.If there is another one, I'll think I'll go to the library rather than spend my money."
2,Too many loose ends!,"As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely. However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved. Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him. Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral! Same thing for Liz Hart. She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her. What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series? We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships. I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago."
3,Fans have to have it,"Anyone who isn't a fan shouldn't start the series here. I agree withthe other reviews, losing a main character should rate more thana mention."
1,The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell - bombed,"Up until the last few books by Lilian Braun, I have been delighted and enchanted with Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum and the various characters and story lines in Qwill's life. But the last few books have been progressively rambling and not at all in Braun's former style. I was greatly disappointed in the ""Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell."" Lilian Braun is a grand old lady who should know when its time to rest on her laurels.Dorothy KohanskiColumbia, MD"
5,The Cat Who Dropped A Bombshell,"This is one of a series of mystery novels that Lilian Jackson Braun has authored and like all the previous titles in her series, I find the book totally entertaining and hard to put down. As a cat lover, I'm thrilled by the way she uses the cats in her story line to help solve these mysteries. I look forward to her next novel in the series."
3,clarifications...,"""The sad fact is that if Ms. Braun were still alive, she'd be over 100 years old now.""um, she was born in 1913? do the math???I agree this book was not nearly anything compared to the rest of the series... it had several disappointments... however, as a collector, I am always thrilled to hear when a new TCH is coming out... Hopefully the next one will have been straightened out... or maybe if there is a ghostwriter someone could just nix this book & rewrite another in it's place, as if that whole book had been nothing but a freaking nightmare... I know the writing was!"
4,The cat who,"Someone had given me a ""cat who"" book and I really enjoyed it, so I went back and bought all the previous books and read them in order. Since then I have kept up with the series as each new book comes out. Each book is an easy read and is very entertaining, you really can get caught up with the characters and their lives. You feel badly for the loss of some characters through acident or murder. I'm sure any cat owner can well believe the sixth sense that cat's seem to exhibit. And I can't help wondering - is Qwill ever going to marry Polly?"
3,I agree,I love Lilian Jackson Braun & I own every book she has ever written but this one is really boring in the beginning. You know who is going to die & who killed them before the murder even happened. I'm glad I read it but I know I won't read it a second time. Never really picked up.
2,A bit of fluff,"This latest entry in ""The Cat Who"" series is a short (under 200 pages) bit of fluff which has landed on the bestseller list and keeps habitual readers like me coming back for yet another disappointment. The books definitely hit their peak in the middle of the series and have been going downhill ever since. All of Braun's usual characters are there, both human and feline, but they don't do much other than go out to eat and prepare for the latest local celebration--in this book it's called ""Pickax Now"". Although the books continue to make money, they are definitely not up to the standard that the author set earlier in the series, and should probably come to a dignified halt before they slip any further."
1,Total disappointment!,"Over the years, I devoured each ""Cat Who..."" novel as soon as it came off the presses in mass paperback format. This one has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It looks like someone else, rather than Ms. Jackson Braun, wrote it. The plot was non-existent; the characters were uncharacteristically depicted; the writing thin and repetitious. Entire sentences were copied again and again throughout the book. There was no true end to the story. In short... this was my last ""Cat Who..."" book ever. Save your money."
2,Left feeling very disappointed,"The book was very short!As others have written, a regular character was killed off! Where was the reaction in Pickax? The character's significant other's reaction? The Pickax funeral?I was left wanting the rest of the story!"
1,Not a mystery anymore,"I love Ms. Braun's books, but it's almost getting ridiculous to call them mysteries. I often figure out the whole scenario before anyone in the book even realizes there's a problem. I love reading these books; they're like coming home. I love finding out what all of our favorite characters are up to. But it's not much of a mystery anymore, and Qwill doesn't even come close to being the one who solves it. The truth is often dropped into his lap, and the ""bad guy"" is usually beyond the point of apprehension, which tends to leave me with a sense of incompletion. I love the home-town-y feeling of the books, and yet the substance is now often lacking."
4,Not one of her best,"This was an interesting book, but I believe that some of her other ones were more interesting. I think that the ending should have been more to the point as to what happened to the character in question......."
2,Murder is subtext,"If you like murder mysteries, don't waste your time on this one. It is mostly about parades and parties and briefly mentions a murder."
3,Andre Norton Beginnings,"This was her first book. It was a little immature and dated, but I enjoyed it and it kept my interest. This is another perspective of her abilities in the beginning and how she later honed and improved her plots and ability to hold your interest."
4,Spirituality made easy,Jim has a way of taking difficult issues pleging humanity and making them easy. Common folk can use this book to develop a true sense of the nonviolence God calls us to in their home with their families. With this book they can do it with resources as close as their local video store and their own music collection. This is a great book for developing a family spiritualty based on religious values common to us all no matter your faith.
3,At least he wasn't a writer.,"Like others have said, this movie is very predictable. Nothing unexpected happens, and in that way, I guess it seems more real than other movies. This would be the safe choice when it comes to the three available premiers on Amazon. You know what you are getting after the initial 34 minutes, and the rest is just waiting for the other shoe to drop."
2,Tough To Watch,"I can accept one main character who is at rock bottom, but both is almost too much. Neither knows the other and have to go through the long awkward phases of connecting and revealing themselves. There are some stories in life that deserve the dignity and sensitivity of not being told. A woman with a dead baby inside her belly for me is near the top of that list."
3,Nice set...BUT,"Ordered this 3 piece gravy boat set. Was shipped on time. When I opened the box the saucer was broken into 6 pieces. The seller, not Amazon, packed the 3 pieces very poorly with minimal protection against breakage. I was quite disappointed and immediately set up for a return."
3,Broken ladle,"I like how the gravy boat looks and I love how it comes with the resting plate, but like the other reviewer, the ladle came broken. I didn't return it because it's too much hassle. I just wanted the boat and plate. Would be nice if all the ladles weren't broken though."
5,The Confessions of A. Crowley,"This book is unique because it dispels many myths about Crowley. The book is huge and is well worth the read; however, Crowley had a tendency to give his opinions (more magic and less opinions, please!)excessively through the book (which got a little annoying), and if the reader can get past this, he or she will discover a man who was an exceptional magician. Crowley was definitely a trailblazer in the occult. This book is an excellent read on a facinating individual. After I read the book, my opinion of Crowley was forever altered favorably for this magician. Do not just settle for someone else's perception of Crowley in other books (though these do have their usefulness), buy the book and get most of the facts from the man himself, Crowley. All magicians should own a copy of this book for their occult library. A well written book and a must read for the occultist."
4,"Great book, but the author rambles on a bit","After reading this book for the second time, I have to say that it is a very involved reading. While the book does keep you turning pages to discover just where the manical storyline goes next. Overall most of the sections have a tendancy to ramble on a bit like some of the more annoying unedited Steven King works, but not as excessively. If your only ever going to read one Aliester Crowley book, this is the one."
3,Man or Beast?,"This was an interesting book. All in all he was a fascinating person. But... although he did call himself the Beast and 666, within the book there was hardly any display of Crowley being evil or beastly at all; other than his somewhat unusual demeanor and magical potential. In other words, his reputation and aka's for such a pedestal of devilish greatness was very over-rated."
5,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.,"Describes, in the most excellent poetical literary form possible to man, the story of 666's life. The miscellaneous adventures in his early life are all recorded with the utter zeal that only he can produce. After 1909 though, he was pulled liberally along with the current of Prana that most fitted him. I remember a childhood story of Scientific Sadism. I have the belief that this book should be supplemented with Israel Regardie's famous "" Interpretation of Aleister Crowley,"" although I would think that it is much too over-exagerated: Regardie does display massive amounts of knowledge (regarding the price, also, it is reasonably cheap for the content of information manifested).To sum up, I think I can do no better than to direct the attention of the wary over to "" An Interpretation of Aleister Crowley."""
1,This is for the badly formated ebook only,"The format is off. With random number in the text. I think someone copied a web page and just made an ebook out of it.There are words missing making it hard to read. Go find a better copy.The content is good, the format is horrible.Nelson."
1,Hello? When does it get interesting?,"Maybe I am being unfair, but come on! I bought this hoping to glean some magical, mysterious knowledge from it, but to my surprise, there isn't any! This book is nothing but Crowley patting himself on the back. For the first hundred pages all he does is talk about what a great mountain climber he is, that he is the best and how everyone is jealous. I struggled to keep with it. There are MAYBE two and half entire pages dealing with astrology and again all he does is brag about how he can tell a person's ascendant just by looking at the person. He doesn't tell the reader how to do it, or go into any depthon the subject. I expected so much more from Crowley relating to Magic and esoteric subjects and it just isn't there!"
2,As Romantic As Hazardous Waste,"Wong(Koo) is a banker with the romantic sensibility of a stone. For Valentine's day he takes his date to a cheap restaurant and invites an obnoxious friend. Disgusted, Anne decides to break up with Wong, but Wong's uncle intervenes persuading Anne to delay her decision until Easter. Desperate, Wong consults a teenage romance 'doctor'to help him get his lovelife back on track.Seriously, this was simply a bad film. Koo played an unlikable loser and Anne and he had no chemistry. Koo! Please no more glasses! *Whew* just had to get that off my chest. Seriously, this was a very poor HK romantic comedy. Wong and Anne were boring and unromantic and the plot unbelievable. 2 stars... NEXT-!"

1,Alexander the Great A Biography,"In the description it didn't state that it was a former public library book and that it was stamped as such in various places and even included the library card holder. The book was profusely underlined. I was extremely disappointed because your description was ""good"". I wouldn't buy from this seller"
2,The book does not promote traditional Catholic education.,Although I found the book informative it lacks in true knowledge of Catholicism. They also promote the use of secular and largely protestant materials and barely mention the traditional Catholic programs out there for Homeschoolers. Think twice before you buy this book. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Problematic,"While this book is an easy to read guide to homeschooling, there are problems with its ""Catholicity"". Kimberly Hahn has recommended some sources which are Protestant -produced and anti-Catholic. There is an underlying tone of disapproval of traditional Catholic sources such as the baltimore Catechism which most homeschooling Catholic parents I know prefer to use.Just beware. Why two ""catholic"" authors have chosen to do this only points to the fact that there are deep divisions in the Catholic hoemschooling movement. These two ladies see themselves as Catholic home educator leaders but they do not represent all."
1,nothing good about this single.,"IT'S TRUE NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS SINGLE ""NOTHING GOOD ABOUT GOODBYE"".PHONIEX IS A WASTE.I DON'T LIKE HIM AND HIS SONGS.THIS CD ALSO HAS CLPIS FROM HIS NEW ALBUM.""SORRY"" IS ONE(YEAH,SORRY FOR PUTTING THIS SINGLE OUT.) AND ""I NEED YOU TONIGHT""(SOUNDS LIKE ""LARGER THEN LIFE"" FROM THE BACKSTREET BOYS.) THIS CD IS WASTE AND NOT WORTH BUYING."
2,Lame Follow Up... ...,"Murders In Hollywood seems to be a lame sequel to HollywoodGhosts and Gravesites. The only reason I gave this DVD twostars is for the fine narration and opening scene of Hollywoodas it looks today. Otherwise this is merely a slideshow of stillimages reproduced badly. The crime scene photos appear to comefrom whatever books on Hollywood were available during production of this documentary. There are no new revelations here, or anything you don't already know about Filmland murders.Production of this DVD seemed to be extremely rushed. DeltaEntertainment is capable of much better product than this. Comeon you guys."
4,Not bad.,"I only knew Mala Fe for their hit ""La Vaca"" before I got this album. After listening to this album I can say that I am a fan. Good beats and something you just want to dance to."
4,ghostly,Its mysterious and keep me in suspense and wondering as to what was going to happen next in the book
1,Disc arrived ruined!,I watched a family member open this movie Christmas Eve and was just as dissapointed as my sister to see the disc with several scratches on it. Ill be returning it!
5,Hilarious!,"I actually bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for one of my girlfriends. I am absolutely crazy about Outrageous Fortune and never tire of watching it, so I wanted my friend to get to experoince it as well. One of the best female buddy movies around."
5,Hilarious,"what do you expect when you mix Middler with Long? great great funny story, about where love could lead you sometimes :) great commedy"
3,"OK, but not that great","Bette Midler is the real standout in this film, which is by now somewhat dated. But she's sharp as a gold-plated rhinestone and makes this movie come alive. It's not that Shelly Long is bad; she's not--she's fine. But because of the more-than-cliched plot, it needs something extra to carry it through, and Bette does that quite well.Rather than focusing on the plot--that's been done above and by others--I'll just say that this could be a good movie to watch if you need a couple of chuckles (but not a lot) and don't have too many better things to do. Russian spies and renegade agents and FBI men who talk about season tickets to the Redskins--yeah, OK, great. Making a last-minute plane, posing as a cop, being chased by dangerous guys--uh huh, sure, right.You get the picture."
1,Outrageous junk,"A girl-buddy movie starring Shelley Long and Bette Midler as two women in love with the same guy. When they learn that he's ""used"" both of them, they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from New York to New Mexico. Silly and dumb, with the usual chase fare thrown in. Everything is a cliche, from the opposing personality idea (Long is an orderly goody-twoshoes, Midler a loudmouthed mess) to desert hippies to car chases, etc, etc. The movie seems to go on endlessly."
5,"Not your ordinary ""chick flick""","Outrageous Fortune is outrageously funny ... really fine acting all the way around ... Shelly Long and Bette Midler made a terrific team and played off each other extremely well ... loved George Carlin, his best film role [for me, since this is about my opinion]! To see this film is to see women as they actually are when it comes to men, but done with humor."
5,Love this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies and honestly I don't know why Long and Midler didn't do more movies together. (Maybe they didn't get a long on the set?) Anyway, I thought the women were hilarious and I loved how they ladies incorporated their acting and dancing skills to get them from point A to point B and how it all turns out to save the day. When I was a teenager, I used to watch this movie over and over. Weird I know."
4,Outrageous Fortune,"If you liked 80's comedies, you'll like this movie. If you are a Bette Midler fan, this is a must see."
5,Toddler Transportation,"My 3 year old son received this as a gift at 18 months and he has loved it ever since. He used it as a push toy then and now it's his means of transportation through the house. The buttons are safety related, like, ""this is mommy, look both ways before crossing the street"". It still looks and works like brand new and it's 2 years old, my 1 yr. old daughter is now enjoying it as well. Durable and sturdy, this one is a must have!!!"
4,Fun but loud,"My son just got this for a birthday gift and it's just great. It is just very loud and has no volume control. It has lots of fun buttons to play with, two guys, and the fire hat (which my husband got to wear first)."
2,I know you guys will hate me for review,"First i was expecting like a realistic game and more open world but it is cartoony and its just in a mall not the streets and you only get 72 hours to finish the objectives , i do not recommend this but , if you like the cartoony style of gaming you might like it."
3,Like a frozen pizza...,It should be fun but it's like a frozen pizza. No matter what fresh pizza tastes better.... this is just a frozen pizza version of a fresh pizza game. I know it doesn't make sense... but the game doesn't either. It's frustrating. The save feature is really annoying and you get stuck trying to kill a boss. I didn't think it was very fun. Just download the demo on XBOX live. Save some bucks. Repetive game play. Walk and stalk... yuck. Frozen Pizza baby.
2,The video game equivalent of walking dead,"This game is a rental at best. The graphics are OK, but the story is lame and the controls are steps behind what I am expecting in the year 2006. When the characters interact, most of the dialog is typed on the screen, not spoken. How lame is that? This game has that Capcom feel; that sort of few-steps-behind video gaming that I expect from these guys. As a huge zombie fan, I will play it but they can't make me enjoy it. RENT THIS GAME."
1,They didn't put thought about its audiences,"Any products should be thinking well about their customers, and I believe video game is no exception to it.This title fails to meet that with all respect.It is already major show stopper that the screen text is unreadable. With enough frustration with its save system, and control issues, I don't think this game deserves any thing but one star."
2,Very disappointing game from Capcom,"If you do not have an HDTV, I would NOT recommend this game - you will be unable to read text on the screen - which for some reason, Capcom made it imperative that you will need in order to get critical information regarding your mission (unlike any of the Resident Evil series). I normally love Capcom games but this was a major disappointment with a costly price tag. Rent the game for less to see what a joke the screen text is."
1,"So many zombies, so little fun.","My beef with this game: The zombie animations are choppy and obnoxious, it has one of the worst saving mechanisms I've ever seen in a game, the story line is mediocre at best, Frank's neck looks really weird when he's running (That one is kinda irrelevant)The gun play is terrible, and items like the umbrella go through the floor and what not. That's just from what I can remember, I'm sure there's more.The only thing good about this game to me is that you can kill zombies with anything, but that really doesn't balance out the other flaws. I got this game because I wanted to slay my way through a zombie apocalypse, but I later ended up getting with Left 4 Dead(which rocks)."
3,Great... for the first few hours.,"I remember playing this with a friend for a little bit when it first came out and I had a great time killing the zombies. So recently I was looking for a cheap game to buy and this came to mind. For the first 2-3 hours of game play, I remembered why I enjoyed the game. However, once you've killed zombies every which way there is after the first few hours, you find yourself with a rather boring and monotonous game."
3,disappointing,"Well, the price was low, the delivery fast, and the fights fun. The problem is that there is one save slot, saving your game is a hassle, and if you miss a major mission or die, you get sent back to your last save point. Progress is relatively slow and missions complicate the game so much there is little zombie fighting time. I didn't like the game and got bored fairly quickly. Again, the violence was good and the weapons interesting but still too many problems."
3,Beware the details.,"While I have enjoyed the game thus far it has been a challenge to play it correctly on my personal television. I have a 15' screen and it is really hard to read the instructions, directions, hits, and tips that come with the game. It makes it really difficult to follow the game and stay in the action when i have to focus my attention on the small font to learn the next step in the challege. Its really affecting my opinion of the game as i feel that im not able to stay in 'game mode'."
4,"Awsome zombie game, but not perfect","I have to say that this is one of the best zombie games that I've ever played. Like most games on the 360, you'll only be able to notice the amazing graphics if you have an hdtv. If you play the game on a standard tv, the graphics look mediocre at best. The storyline is awsome and theres plenty of zombies to kill. Although, one of the things that I didn't like about the game was that it was pretty difficult and theres no difficulty setting to make the game any easier. I also didn't like the text on the bottom of the screen during the cut scenes, they really didn't need to put them there. All and all this is a must have for any fan of zombies."
4,Diffrent from anything i have played but fun,I love the concept of the game. It gets pretty hectic with a time limit on everything you do. It is one of those games that you play awhile put it done for awhile then pick it up again. Overall a great game with a great concept. I am eager to see if they make a second one.
4,Mindless zombie fun,"Im not exactly sure what the unhappy reviewers were expecting. Me, I don't require a heck of a lot from a zombie game. It's easy to learn, easy to navigate, the zombies are incredibly realistic, blood & body parts are constantly flying, and the variety of weapons is awesome, regardles of their efficacity. A giant toy laser sword doesn't help you a bit, but it sure is funny to watch.Granted, I am by no means a hardcore gamer, so I cannot speak to some of the rather exacting standards I've read from other reviewers. But I will attest that if you love zombie movies and have a sick sense of humor, this game is worth having."
2,Great premise done the Xbox way,"Amazing idea for a game and something I've been waiting for. The graphics are cool, the environment cool but the controls are ridiculous. It's a difficult game to play. Maybe number two will be better and not. . . number two."
3,Overhyped,"This was the greatest game I had ever played... for the first 90 minutes. After having to restart over and over again just to build up my character enough to not die, it quickly lost appeal. It went from being a fun game to being tedious, after so long it turned into a chore. It still sits in the bottom of my game drawer, unfinished, and I doubt it ever will be."
2,Seriously Flawed For Non-HDTV Owners,The text in this game is so small that it makes the game almost unplayable on an SDTV.
4,"Lots of fun, but gets old",This game is tons of fun. There is so much to do and see and there are so many ways to kill zombies that you can spend hours entertaining yourself just doing nothing. The only problem is that it can get old after a while and eventually it just kind of feels like a grind if you try to get some of the Xbox achievements. Overall though it's fun and if you're an avid zombie killer this is totally for you.
2,Good Idea...bad design.,"This game is can be fun at first, but once you play for awhile only to have all your progress lost because you failed to finish an objective within the time limits, it gets lame very quickly. Like I said, you have a time limit in which all your objectives must be completed. No problem except that you literally spend so much time running back and forth through the stupid mall that it eats all your time up. You are constantly running to your next objective...CONSTANTLY! It gets really boring, really quick. It would be more fun if there was no time limit so you could take your time and kill some zombies along the way but there is no time even to do that. Also, their are bosses that are so stinking hard it's stupid. They can get shot up like crap and barely any power is taken off their health bar. The only reason I gave this two stars is because I like the variety of weapons. Although some are really stupid--like giant plastic lipstick container. What is THAT???"
4,NOT BAD,tOO BLOOD YOU CAN PLAY BUUUUUUUTT........... I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IT'S GOOD BUT I WAIT SOMETHING MORE
4,Text in game is too small.,Awesome game but the text is difficult to read in game. Larger text would make this game much better.
3,It was a birthday gift for a friend,"I bought this for my friends birthday, and I don't know if he has even played it yet since we've been so busy with school. But the game did arrive promptly and in perfect condition."
3,Better zombie games out there; not bad,"I bought this Xbox game because I read a decent review on GameSpot and I like survival horror games...it was cheap so I gave it a shot.It's not bad, but like many others have said, the load times are kinda long and there's very few places to save.Another annoyance was the game throwing a multitude of missions at you while in the middle of another mission. Can't I just concentrate on this one mission that's tough enough, without that dorky janitor telling me that there are 3 survivors here and 2 survivors there to rescue elsewhere?! I'm just a photographer, for crying out loud!!Frankly, DH and I couldn't even get through the shootout scene at the food court! It was frustrating and even GameFaqs was no help! I'm here to kill zombies, not take out some wacky long-haired living dude.I'll keep trying, but Left 4 Dead and RE5 are a lot more fun and have more of my attention at the moment."
2,Needs a mouse!!!,"This game might have been great, but two things killed it:1) A horrible save system - you can save only at your base and have only one save slot. The result? You have to run through a time consuming gauntlet to get back to where you can save, or risk losing all your progress. Most of my first 10 or so hours were spent replaying parts I had already finished or running back to the base to save. Just abysmal when it could easily have been better.2) Aiming guns is nearly impossible. The awkward aiming controls mean you shoot all around your target. This badly needs mouse control.Put this out on the PC with mouse/keyboard control and save anywhere functionality and it might be one of the best games of the past couple of years. As it is - NOT! It is so sad when games are ruined by stupid fixable crap like this. :("
1,First-person shopping,Th(loading)is game sounded like fun but turns out to be a h(loading)orrible bore. It takes longer th(loading)an an Ayn Rand novel to warm up. You spend about 45 minutes suffering th(loading)rough(loading) teenage dialog before you get to swing a wrench(loading) at a zombie. Th(loading)e save system is about 10 years beh(loading)ind th(loading)e state of th(loading)e art. Th(loading)e figh(loading)t system is nonexistant. If you like replaying 20 minutes of mash(loading)ing th(loading)e X button in between a loading screen every 6 feet th(loading)is migh(loading)t be for you...
2,Fun if you are super drunk.,"This is one of those games that, if sober, is fun for about an hour... if drunk, maybe 3 hours. After that you're done. It's just a lot (A LOT) of running back and forth doing stupid little quests and killing hordes of zombies."
4,Dead Rising,"I really do like this game BUT... the fact that your time is limited when it comes to quests in the game is REALLY ANNOYING. When I first puchased the game (on release date), I thought that it was a free roaming type. I thought that I can just go around and take my time with quests while killing zombies, but NO!! I finished the game and overtime- after dying about a million times. I do like the fact that if you start another game, you start out at the same level as a previous game. For instance, you select New Game (previous game level 35) you start out at level 35 in your new game. I liked the Wii version better (although the graphics suffered a bit), because no timer."
5,So much fun!,"You need a High Def tv for this game, though. There's a lot of tiny text you won't be able to read without a nice tv."
2,How is this a game?,This game is very bad. I can't believe I wasted my money on it. I don't like it one bit.
2,Terrible Game,"If you like dying a lot, and by a lot i mean a lot, without every getting anything done this is the game for you. controls are crap, gameplay is crap, and you only have 3 game days to beat the game."
1,Don't buy if you have a SDTV,"Just a warning. The text in this game is so small that on a SDTV you can't read it. This makes the game unplayable, as you can't read the text for all the missions and conversations. I honestly can't believe they put the game out without realising this flaw. Apparantly it is better with a HDTV, but I have still read people are having problems with the font even then."
1,how is it possible,this game isnt suppose to come out until june 24 how do you guys got it so early ?
1,YOU CANNOT SAVE!!!,"I played this game for about 5 hours straight and came across NO save points. Then, these convicts driving around in a jeep w/ a rifle attached to it started chasing me around shooting at me and I died, (WTF?!). Oh well, no big deal, I can just continue, right? WRONG!!! THIS GAME HAS NO FRIGGIN CONTINUES AND YOU HAVE TO START THE GAME FROM THE BEGINING!! DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU PLAN ON BEATING THE GAME WITH 4 MEASLEY BARS ON YOUR HEALTH METER!!! THERE ARE WAAYY TOO MANY ZOMBIES FOR THIS GAME TO BE FUN! IT'S A SEA OF ZOMBIES, YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE LET ALONE PICK UP A WEAPON AND TRY TO USE IT!!! GOOD LUCK"
2,Ever played State of Emergency--,"OK, I know that everyone has been saying how great a game this is and how all the zombies on screen looks cool but graphics don't make everything and it certainly shows. Sure it looks cool to see a couple hundred zombies on screen, but gameplay is very shorthanded. This game could be considered a button masher. I thought I would like this game since I loved the new Dawn of the Dead movie, but this game isn't nearly as good as you may think. The sound is great and graphics are ok considering the character models look a little dated and Frank--the main character--does not move fluidly at all. Anyways, I am tired of writing about this average game and think I should just stop. If you want a great action-adventure game, pull the XBOX out of the closet and pick up Ninja Gaiden Black. That game has better graphics anyway and is more fun to play. Rent Dead Rising on a weekend when you have absolutely nothing to do. Or borrow it from a friend for free."
1,Great Idea....Bad Execution,"I like killing zombies as much as the next guy but this game just falters in two many areas, mostly the fact that your mission instructions and other help from your allies come as text whose font is much to small to be read on a low def tv with a small screen, which I happen to have. So you can't play this game to any sucess without the guide book, and the guide book of course ruins the achievement of making it through the game on your own. And the save system absolutely sucks there is no excuse for it.Dont buy it, rent it."
5,Dead Rising review,"Great game, eventhough I dont play it my kids do. As I watch them play Im sure they are enjoying the game as they were playing it a lot!!"
3,decent,"This game is really fun at first, but after awhile it get a little repeditive. worth buying but I would sell it used after you are done."
2,Save your money!!!,Don't get me wrong...I love the thought of a zombie game for XBOX 360 but I have to say that I was disappointed with this one. The graphics are outdated and you can't read the text in the game itself. I couldn't believe it. Trust me ya'll skip this one and keep your money in your pocket. I suppose I give more power to those that love it...old schoolers! LOL!
2,"Fun game but gets old to fast, and has to many problems.","This game is awesome at first because you can kill zombies with almost about anything you want but it gets old to fast because you have to survive 72 hrs. It also suffers from screen text being to small and cellphone calls disable you from attacking or jumping, plus if you get hit while talking the guy makes you listen to the entire convo all over again. I hope the wii version fixes these problems."
3,Great fun but room for improvement.,"This game is amazing. Huge mobs of killable zombies roaming around, violent deaths, weapons everywhere and a Jackie Onasses dress with your name on it in the local womans clothing store. After i put on the pink dress and my lego helmet i began killing zombies with a shower spout. HUGE HUGE FUN.Room for improvement would definetly be the save system. It's frustrating to have to run for 10 minutes to find a save location, especially when your girflriend is screaming at you about how much you play Dead Rising."
3,"Dead Rising , somewhat Amusing","I purchased this game with high hopes from the Demo. While it does look good, it's a game I can only play for about an hour at a time. It's quite repetitive but that's not all bad, it's pretty fun for a while, just need to take breaks from it.This game is not much fun in Standard Def. I switched from Standard to HD, you can't read all of the text in Standard def. from ingame phone calls, to tell you what to do.Without multiplayer this game is lacking. I can't sit down with a friend, wether he be at my house or at his and play this game with anyone. That makes this game sit on the shelf more than most others. While I do enjoy it, it'll have a short shelf life for me, once you play through I have no real reason to continue other than to smash zombies, which is fun, but I can live without for the price. If they were to add in multiplayer it'd revive this game for me."
4,Entertaining,"Dead Rising is one of those games that kind of come out of nowhere when a developer decides to take a chance on a new property. Dead Rising does almost everything right, you can kill zombies with any thing you can find to pick up or drive. The only problem I had was that the save system was a little harsh, you had to hike to the security center just to save if a bathroom wasn't around. Dead Rising has become one of my favorite games for the 360."
1,Disgusting lack of detail,"Does this game have zombies you can kill? Yes. Does it have any of the other features capcom promised us? NO. Not only is the main character annoying, and all of his buddies are dumb as dirt, the gameplay just isn't good. You cannot fire a gun without plenty of frustration and most likely you will miss your target. Don't try to understand the plot, there is none. The game allows you to interact with more objects than probably any game before it, but definitely not everything you hoped for. It's pretty much sword, wood, lawnmower and vehicle, and everything else is the same thing with a different name (baseball bat = wooden plank). Don't buy this game. If anything, play the demo or even enjoy it at a friend's house, but don't waste your money (or time)."
4,Short Game - Replayability High,"The only reason I give this game 4 stars and not 5 is that the game is relatively short. However, with so many different features it doesn't matter. I'm currently on my 3rd time through the game and it's still a blast.So many options for weapons, so many skills to gain from levels. There's numerous ways to kill zombies. Skills such as the face crusher, disembowel, and the suplex never get old.This is a must for 360 owners."
3,What a letdown,"J.W. Mullins' review is dead-on; this game is a massive letdown. Instead of being a virtual sandbox, the game is over scheduled and overly difficult. Really, if your idea of fun is ""being on time,"" then this is the game for you. The only thing missing is an in-game virtual wife to follow you around reminding you about your honey-do list.That said, the game is to some extent still open-ended. Weapon variety is very entertaining, and you are free to just explore, though once you miss a storyline mission, the remainder of the storyline is closed off to you.In summary, there's still some fun to be had killing zombies, but the game is a great disappointment overall. Games shouldn't feel like work; this one does."
3,deadrising,"very happy with how fast the game shipped!!!!ok here we go as far as game play its your normal 3rd person view game with those sometimes hard to controll, controls lol....running around breaking into stores using whatever u can find as a weapon and killing zombies is awesome...the bad part is only one save point so if u die u loose all your work prior to last save...the other bad part is its a timed game and you have to rescue people do missions fight bosses if you fail to beat a mission on time you can kiss beating the game all the way goodbye....but if you dont care about that and wanna just kill zombies this is the game for you..."
4,DeadRising,Game was real good the use of everything in the mall was my favorite thing about the game. Lots of different ways to kill zombies so get it and have fun.
2,Over rated gore fest,"I got this game on sale and all i can say is it's fun in small chunks to let some frustration out,but it has some bad flaws.The text size is small for those that don't have a hd wide screen,the save system is annoying.You have to find a break room or go back to the safe spot to save.If you find this game for under 10 dollars like i did buy it.But be aware of the repetitive zombie kill fest"
3,"Good fun, mildly repetitive","A must own game for anybody with a 360 and an affinity for zombie movies. Fighting off hordes of zombies is a hoot, and the different kinds of moves that you can pick up are a lot of fun to acquire. The only question is how many zombies can you kill before you feel like doing something else?"
2,HDTV = REQUIRED,"I really want to love this game. It has everything that I like in a title. However, I don't have an HDTV and after a little while it becomes almost unplayable. There are many who would argue that the gameplay doesn't rely on being able to read the text, and that is true. However, there is only so much zombie smashing that you can do before you need a break. I would like to take the missions as a break, but I can't because I can't read the text. Also, this game gets really hard in places, like unmanageably hard. I don't know how anyone is able to rescue any survivors from the other mall sections while the guys in the jeep are out there, and killing them isn't anywhere as easy as the online guides lead you to believe.Not the the weak of heart, the weak of stomach, or the weak of pocketbook."
4,"Great game, but the save feature sucks!","It takes a little while to get familiar with the controls for this game, but once you figure it out you'll have a blast.This is a VERY bloody, violent game, but for me it was not at all scary. I enjoyed slashing, crashing and mutilating the zombies. Rescuing the survivors (and keeping them alive) is a real challenge.I have beaten the game a couple of times, but have yet to get the ""good"" ending. It has very good replay value, because all the skills that you learn in a previous game are available from the start in a new game.One thing I do not like is the save feature. You can only have one save slot per memory device for each profile on your 360. So unless you have a hard drive AND a memory card, you can only have one save slot. If it were not for this ""flaw"" I would have given it 5 stars overall."
2,I'd Skip This Game,"I bought this game thinking that it'd be like a Left for Dead type of game. It's an okay game but the ""Save"" system is horrible. When you get killed you have to restart the whole game over which can be very frustrating. Hopefully when DeadRising 2 comes out they'll fix this problem. The gameplay's pretty decent though. If you're thinking of buying this game, rent it first otherwise I'd wait for the sequel to come out to this one."
4,Coming 4 U Barb,"Overall, I liked the game a lot and played it a 2nd time just to max out all level ups and go on a killing rampage, but the part that always griped me was that the SMALL screen scripts to read whenever you get a hint or message, and too many overlaps in missions to save people within a too limited amount of time. The hopping around on the heads of the zombies to finally clear the last challenge probably sounded good on paper, but in practice it was frustrating. Otherwise, I liked it, but not a great deal of re-play value once you beat it unless you want to do the rampage thing."
1,Bad!,"These ear phones were really bad! I plugged it into the treadmill at the gym and I actucally got an electric shock... twice! Quite painful. It worked ok with my ipod. I guess it's ok to use it with a battery operated gadget, but never with some that has a power cable plugged in.I have shipped this item back and I am hoping to see the refund soon."
1,"Awful, Disappointing for a Sony Product - Guess You Get What You Pay For","These earphones were cheap, and that's the best description for them.They're OK if you're *perfectly still* while using them, but if you start moving, you'll get LOTS of ""earphone noise"" as the wire rattles around in the earphone casing -- SOOO annoying when you're walking or running.I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent pair."
1,Too much static,These earphones have an unacceptably high amount of static when used with my laptop and a noticeable amount of static when used with my ipod. I would not puchase this product again.
5,Will never use any other earphones! Love these,"Being a teenager, I naturally listen to my ipod 24/7 and abuse my earphones (they usually break within a month). I constantly needed to buy new pairs until I found the ones by Sony. They've lasted half a year so far and are just as great as they were the day I bought them. At $10 they're completely affordable and they are worth every penny! Not only are they durable, they have great sound quality, are comfortable to wear, and come in many colors for you to choose from.I will never go back to using any other earphones. It's money well spent and I highly recommend them."
2,You get what you pay for,"I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about, but these earbuds are pretty bad considering they're from Sony. They are comfortable to wear and do fine in the higher ranges, but they put out absolutely no bass. If you like actually hearing the beat when you listen to music, don't buy these."
1,Baffled,"When I use these earbuds in my work computer's speakers, they receive SO much feedback, it's ridiculous! No other earbuds I have ever owned had this extreme of a problem, and I have had lots of earbuds over the years. What's more, there aren't even any electronic devices closeby when it does this.The absolute worst thing about these earbuds though, is that they emit some sort of frequency occasionally that actually HURTS my ears. It lasts for a split second and feels like someone is actually shocking my ear canal. Is Sony trying to damage my eardrums?? I am very curious to know if anyone else has had these sorts of problems.This product is HORRIBLE."
1,BROKEN WITHIN ONE WEEK!?!?!,"When it comes to purchasing electronics Sony is the first brand that pops into my mind, so when it was time for a new set of earbuds for my iPod I thought that I would give these a try...now I wish I hadn't. After a week of normal use, listening to music/plugged up to my laptop, the speaker on the left side had popped out. At first I thought nothing of it and popped it back into place, but when I went to listen to my iPod the left speaker was completely dead. I am really disappointed with this Sony product, thank God it was only $10."
2,generic Apple iPod earbuds are better,"These didn't last 18 months; the right bud is dead. I should be thankful, since I never like them at all and have reason to get anything else."
2,Cheap Stuff,"I got these (same color) at Target for 9.99. Why is this priced for 15.29 here? Anyway, they're alright. I don't like the cheap foam covers, the flimsy cord, or the sound quality. Save your money and buy better earbuds/headphones. The SkullCandy brand seems good and isolates the sound from outside noise, they're also trendy. Just don't get these cheap ones."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased these in late Sept. 2007 on the basis of Amazon reviews. (At the time, all reviews were positive, either 5- or 4-star). Now, I see that there are several low ratings and I'm afraid my experience fits with the latter group of evaluations.To be sure, they did sound great at first....much improved over the IPOD standard issue earbuds. However, one of the two buds (right ear) never fit snug. It constantly became loose and needed readjustment whenever I was in some kind of motion (I have no reason to listen to earbuds when I'm sitting still), especially when I go jogging. However, I put up with this, because they were fairly cheap and did sound nice. And then, all of the sudden, the sound in the right earbud totally died....5 months? I expect more from Sony, or any other manufacturer. Even the IPOD earbuds, as bad as they sound, last longer than that."
2,Sorry to say...,...but this is a series of books that I truly did not enjoy that much. It was hard to follow until you got to the last couple chapters or the next book. Don't know if I would recommend...am neutral on that one.
5,Wonderful for cool climate gardeners,"Finally, after paging through piles of gardening guides, falling in love with flowers and then discovering they grow only in Zone 9-10, I came across this beautiful, handy book. Thoughtfully laid out, the book is an indispensible guide for those of us living in Zones 3-6. The authors are obviously well-versed in gardening in the upper Midwest and have put together this book with beautiful pictures and descriptions of the plants, as well as straight-forward thoughts on growing and maintaining the plants. The perfect book to study during the long cold winters and then take with to the nursery in the spring."
3,book,"Although it has great information, I don't feel like the information was strongly organized. You basically have to read the entire section about a flower to understand its nature. For a beginner gardner, I would have liked bullet points and more easy to read layout."
4,Perennials everywhere,This is a good guide to perennials to grow in Minnesota. My only issue is that it is too predictable. There are many more perennials that are native to the Minnesota/Wisconsin area and are not as well known. A little more research on the part of the authors would have been appreciated. There are many beautiful plants that need to be discovered. I suggest visiting a couple of web site that sell native plants. (My own favorite is Prairie Moon Nursery.)
2,The picture cracks easily!,"I loved this picture, even purchased one for my trainer - However, the picture cracks easily and cannot be fixed. I wish they could fix the material because I like everything else."
2,water tasted like wet cardboard,"I was disappointed in the taste of the water from the filter. I washed all parts as directed, soaked the filter and threw out the first 3 pitchers of water. I used it for a couple weeks hoping the water taste would improve but it did not. I returned the unit."
5,You get what you pay for!,"I am a professional cabinet maker. This is my third panasonic drill in 27 years. The first one, I couldn't find batteries for. The second one still works, has NEVER been in the repair shop (and its' batteries only lasted ten years) but is finally showing some signs of wear, and I was in a position to ""upgrade"" my tool box, so I got a new one, and now have a spare, as they still use the same batteries. They may cost more than others, but worth it!"
4,expensive but worth it,"Pros:1/2"" chuck, high torque at lower speeds, compact, comfortable grip, chuck stays tight and is easy to use, quality built for professional use.Cons: Motor gets hot, especially at lower speeds. somewhat heavy and makes an unusual noise at lower speeds.It's more money than I wanted to invest in a drill but if it continues to work well and the battery packs last, I'll be happy."
5,Best Cordless on the market!,We have used panasonic cordless drills for the last 15 years. I have 3 three that are 15 years old that are still be used today. We own 15 panasonic cordless drills and wouldn't own anything else. Panasonic is the best on the market!
2,not made in japan,"i bought this specific drill because the techinal data said it was made in japan , but on the drill it self said made in mexico, if i had known that i would have bought the 18 volt. i feel that ive been lied to. its a nice drill , but i feel like i got screwed"
2,"Some good advice, but overall disappointing....","This book does contain some valuable tidbits of information, but it is more than a little disappointing. Having created and restored purses of my own, I was expecting this book to provide definitive information about the restoration process. But alas, the author's instructions are vague in most cases - she offers ""tips"" rather than true instruction. In her historic overview, one also questions whether or not she has ever made a purse herself - she doesn't seem to understand the process of knitting in the round.This volume does contain some beautiful pictures and is very nicely put together. Slightly overpriced, it is still an interesting book for purse collectors and those interested in restoration, but don't look to it for the answers to all of your beading questions."
2,Just my Opinion,"I was a little disappointed with some of the content, the information to repair should be a little bit more detailed but thats just my opinion."
3,"Okay, but not classic Uris","Every now and then, even the great Leon Uris misfired. While ""Mitla Pass"" isn't exactly a bad book, it isn't great, either. Uris focuses his main characters and a number of historic events (centering on the Israeli Sinai campaign of 1956) through an irritating mix of first- and third-person viewpoints. You slog on through, but you just keep wanting him to tell the damned story and stop with all the footwork that, I assume, he and his publisher thought was fancy."
1,"Works great, until you actually need to use it","I bought this drill about 2.5 years ago and it worked for little house projects that popped up. This year I decided to build a deck. About halfway through the project something inside the drill snapped. It sounded like a gear broke, there was a metallic noise inside and the drill stopped working. I'll never buy a Panasonic again, I ordered a new Dewalt yesterday"
5,How and Why To Say 'Goodbye' Gracefully,"This is an amazing doc. Bought it for my two sons, both great dads, who are raising kids and finding it even more comploicated than being officers in the U.S. Army. This film made me and them cry, laugh, think and be grateful that we do have children who enrich our lives and give us the shivers. I recommend this highly for everyone who has or has ever had children. And even for those who have never had children. They might find themselves either vindicated or sorry."
2,Potential Wasted,"I felt Doug Block had a wonderful subject on hand and squandered the opportunity to tell a good story. There were so many directions he could have gone with the film (e.g. the generational divide and changes towards children leaving home, statistical or cultural differences). Instead, it felt creepy at times as he focused too inwardly on his daughter to a degree that felt intrusive even to a casual viewer like me. I give kudos to the daughter for patiently bearing with her father's camera over the years and letting herself be captured on a film. It probably was not Mr. Block's intention, but I felt as if I were watching a reality-TV clip instead of a documentary."
5,sweetest documentary i've seen in ages...,"and i watch every documentary i can - it's my favourite of mr.block's work, it's centered around his family and his relationship with his daughter, and i immediately identified with it, it made me teary at parts, but after i finished it, i watched it again. perfect flick for a rainy day.. it will make you want to grow up in NYC and have such a doting father."
2,Bag itself is decent but 3 of the 4 metal clasps broke withing 6 months,The title pretty much says it all. The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use. The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability. All within about six months of use. Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag.
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is a great series, but be aware that this is an old edition of the book with NO translation into English. I thought I got a good deal on the textbook, then had to spend another $12 on a Latin dictionary!"
2,Not the same,"With Paul out of the picture, The Unseen are definitly not the same band at all. It just seems all the passion has been drained. This album has ok songs, but nothing special. Stick to the first two albums, which were some of the best street punk records of their time."
5,A great album,"After reading the other reviews complaining that this album is pop punk and trash, I decided to download this CD instead of buying it - well, it would have been 10 bucks well spent. I frankly don't know what everybody is complaining about. I bought ""lower class crucifixion"" and ""so this is freedom"" and I loved them - and ""explode"" seems a natural progression from ""lower class crucifixion"". It is a similar sound - its slightly more tuneful but no less fast and the more melodic sound doesn't mean the album loses its raw edge. It is definitely a million miles from pop punk and to me it's the band progressing musically, but not losing sight of what they are about. People are too quick to try and condemn punk bands the second they learn to write a bridge - but they should stop being such whiny little b**ches - the unseen haven't sold out, they are still one of the greatest on the scene today and this album is 100 percent a reflection of that."
3,"Eh, The Unseen have changed for the worse","This is a sad album. The Unseen are gone as an amazing band. Anger and the truth was good but you could tell they were starting to slip. Nothing like the good old days of the unseen before so this is freedom came out. Any of those ""new punk"" kids that really dont get whats going on love this cd which is kinda said since they don't know squat about the unseen before So This Is Freedom.Not an absolutely terrible cd but you can sure tell they are slipping."
3,super. i love darry,"i am not read this book . but when i read custmure comments , i realy die to read this book . i am decided to buy this book and i am sure after reding this book , i like someone whom realy close with me . i an just 19 years old."
4,GREAT VOICES!,"It's really nice to hear that Tyler's voice is maturing with some depth. However, Amanda has one of the best female country voices of this generation. If she sang lead on every song, I wouldn't mind one bit! One day I'd love to see you go SOLO girl!"
5,Tylers Hott!,"the best thing about this song is that tyler is the singer! i love all of his songs from the first album, nothing but love, and i look forward to the upcoming album. I LOVE U TYLER!"
4,A nice interface between dynamics and FEA,"This book reviews the basic concepts of both dynamics and FEA. Vibration is a common phenomenon found in every walk of life. Automobile to watches we can see vibrations everywhere. For a vibration engineer, it is important to analyse the system behavior dynamically. This can be achieved using a FEA tool like ANSYS. This book delivers the exact thing one would expect as an interface between dynamics and FEA."
4,Great for bunny,"This product was great for my netherland dwarf bunny while he was moulting (shedding). It got off a lot of the excess hair really quickly and he enjoyed it as well! The only con with this product is that the hair didn't stick to it as much as I wanted it to. There was some that stayed on, but a majority or it went all over the place. I was glad thought that it worked to get it off my bunny to keep him clean."
3,my dog does not like it,"My lab does not like this product. I gave it 3 stars because it does work, just that my lab prefers my fingers to this. so keep the box if you want to return it. I unfortunately threw mine and was unable to return it."
2,hmmm,"My lemon beagle loves this as a chew toy; unfortunately, I ordered it as described...a grooming brush. lol. I chose it based on reviews and other sites that indicated it worked well for folks with my type of dog. It doesn't do as well brushing away the stray hairs as my just giving her a hand rub/massage.Other reviewers described how their dog like the brush when used and ours did enjoy it as well but just as much as when we use our (no cost) hands :)"
1,Not it...,"I purchased this based off of a Petsmart sales associate. I had previously been using the furminator, which is great. This picks up nothing...my dog is a lab an sheds a lot. I am going back to furminator!"
3,So so,"This doesn't really get thru my dog's hair/fur so to me, it's more of a toy than a grooming tool."
5,Best brush for short-hair,"I have a short hair Jack Russell. I've tried bristled brushes and they do not work on short hair. I bought this ZoomGroom and was highly impressed. My dog loose hair just falls off of her with each stroke. I can't say how it works for long hair, but for short hair it works wonderful."
1,doesn't live up to the kong name,"this didn't really do much for my long, straight, fine hair puppy. it did pick up loose hair but after using the zoom, i still had to comb her to untangle the hair and get it smooth again. so i just ended up using a regular comb instead of doing both. The zoom groom is NOT made from the same material as the kong toys so my puppy was able to chew parts off the zoom groom. once the zoom groom got chewed up even a bit, it would snag my puppy's hair and also make the zoom groom really hard to clean. it's going in the trash."
4,easy on dogs,"This brush is very easy on the dogs. It seems to untangle the hair much better without taking it out. I have yet to get alot of hair,so time will tell. So far Lexi really wants to be brushed with it."
2,Not for short haired dogs,"Doesn't really do much for my frenchie. He doesn't like the ""spiked"" side and doesn't like being pulled at by the rubber side. The static cling wasn't really working either. It took off some hair, but not much! I think it might work for a long haired dog, but not a short hair."
5,Fantastic,"You wouldn't think that a rubber brush would work well, but you'd be wrong! I have one for my ragdoll cat and cairn terrier dog. My dog was very easy to groom with a regular brush, but the cat wasn't a fan of brushing. I got the kong for him first, and he collapsed in ecstasy when I groomed him, purring so loudly I couldn't believe it. Of course, that got the dog's attention, who lined up for her turn. Now, when I open the cabinet drawer where I keep their kong's both coming running to get brushed.The mini-shiatsu massage aside, the kong really does get a lot of dead hair out. Although there are no instructions included, a friend advised that her vet said to use it in a circular motion, like a horse brush. That works best at keeping the hair inside the brush.I can't speak to how it would work on all animals but it works really well for my silky long haired ragdoll cat and coarse long haired cairn terrier.Two paws up on this one!"
3,Pain in the butt,"So my dog has an undercoat and a regular one. It saved us a good amount of hassle when he's ""blowing"" his coat twice a week. It kind of collects on it and you have to pluck it out, the downside being it sometimes tangles itself and it's hard to hold your dogs attention when you're fighting with the grooming object. And then on top of that, if you just leave it on the dog...at least mine, he just shakes...sending hair cascading unto the floor. It's comfortable and my dog likes it but there are better (though pricier) objects out there.If you're dog is seriously blowing cut, the much more expensive defurminator is a better option."
2,Not worth it.,"This product is a hassle to use, especially in the bath. When it gets wet it is very slick and hard to hold on to. I do like the rubber brushes but this one works just as well as one I picked up from the dollar store. If you want to take a pet's undercoat off buy a furminator, it is worth its weight in gold."
5,I use this Zoom Groom Brush when I bathe our Lhasa!,"After I lather the shampoo in our Lhasa's coat, I use the Zoom Groom Brush on her neck, back and chest areas and she seems to enjoy the massage. I used this Zoom Groom on our second Lhasa that is no longer with us and she enjoyed it too. It was included with some other products and packaged very well and arrived within a couple of days after I placed the order."
4,Great for washing!!,"We used the Zoom-Groom at a self-serve dog wash place, but only to wash, not to groom. It works great to wash a dirty, long-haired dog and you don't wear your fingers out scrubbing. Even my 4-year old was able to hold and use it. Don't know how it performs for grooming though. I suspect not well just from my experience with many different brush types."
1,Spreads hair everywhere!,"99.9% of the hair went everywhere, especially on the floor, and hardly any stuck to the zoom groom. I'd rather use another brush and have the hair on the brush then have to spend forever vacuuming & cleaning up the horrible mess of hair the zoom groom causes."
3,not the greatest,Dog does not like this brush. He will not hold still for us to use it on him even in the bath.
2,my dog likes it but i don't,"My puppy is a mutt, best guess as to her breeds is Border Collie/Pointer. She has Pointer or Lab like hair. We just received the ZoomGroom today and she loved being ""brushed"" by it, she even fell asleep. BUT this 'brush' did not collect any hair. The packaging says to brush in circles. I tried that and regular head to tail strokes and nothing on the brush but some loose hair fell on me and surrounding objects. I give it two stars because she liked it so well but I think it's not going to do the job."
4,Great deshedder and bather,"I love using this for getting hair off of my short haired pug and for bathing. This works so much better than my hands at working up the suds and getting in to her fur to get out all the dead hair. It also keeps my hands cleaner and not as itchy from all the hair and dog shampoo. She loves just being massaged with it, as well, in between washes to get all the dead hair off. Great innovative tool!!"
5,LOVE IT,"I had never heard of the ZoomGroom before, but saw it on Amazon and decided to try it. It is amazing! I use it for bathing and dry brushing my dog. I also have the Furminator, and IMHOP I think the ZoomGroom works better on my dog. I have a Boston Terrier, so that may be why, but you should see all the hair that comes off my dog when I use it, compared to the Furminator."
5,eww dog hair!,Love this grooming brush. Who loves it more than I do? My puppy! He actually enjoys getting brushed. I would recommend using it outdoors because you will see a lot of fur fall off.
4,Clean dog,"I was looking for a soft, rubber brush to use on my dog when I bathe him. He has a short harsh coat that needs something better than fingers to work the shampoo into it. This brush arrived just in time for my dog's bath. I used it and he loved how nicely it massaged the shampoo into his coat. I liked how well it spread the shampoo throughout his short, thick coat."
3,"Works great in bath, not so good as a dry brush.","I rated this product a 3 because it did work good in the bath but a couple things that bothered me was1) It did not catch all the hair there was still tons in the drain so I would not say it acts like a magnet to attract hair2) Does not reach all the way to the skinI also find it ineffective as a dry brush as some people were saying the used it. Did not hold the hair to it, it all just fell on the floor and definitely did not get all the loose fur off was about as effective as combing thru with my fingers.My dog is a 65 lb Australian Cattle Dog/German Pointer mix."
5,Very good product,"Works great on my boxer and he loves the gentle massage. On my longer hair lab-beagle mix, didn't seems to get as much hair off, but he still loved the massage too. Nice thing too is you don't have to clean all that hair out like you do a brush."
5,Simply amazing,"I have a 45 lb mutt that has very long fur, but it lays flat, she does not have a double coat. Whenever I bathe her, her fur mats down and make it hard scrub her and get the loose hair out with just your fingers. This zoom groom does an excellent job at loosening the hairs and actually collects most of them in the brush for easy cleanup after the bath. The only thing I recommend is shampooing the dog first and then scrub with the zoom groom. The directions say to put the shampoo directly on the brush but if your dog has long, flat fur like my pup, you waste some shampoo that doesn't even reach the fur. Even with a little wasted shampoo this thing is definitely worth the money!"
4,Great but too big for a lil pup!,"This brush is cool and easy to manage. When you put the shampoo in the brush, it comes out quickly on to the dogs body. I have an 8 week pup so it doesn't work well since its too big. I recommend this brush for adult dogs!"
4,Better than expected,The Zoom Groom is a good brush but even better for the tub. My beagle never liked getting brushed but with the Zoom Groom it seems she's a little more comfortable. But it's also a little hard to get all the hairs off the brush without water. In the tub you can get out even more hair and really massage the coat. I'd recommend this for the tub. For everyday brushing I's stick to a regular brush or deshedding tool.
4,Works great!!,"I love this brush it works wonderful in the bath it defiantly helps bush the soap through my dogs. It works wonderful on my husky it gets so much hair off him. It also works great on my German Shepherd I brush and brush and brush and I just keep getting hair. This bush helps make his coat shiny and softer. Also word of caution it does magnetizes the hair, but it still gets everywhere, so defiantly do it outside. I only rated it 4 stars, because in the year I have had it I have used it also and the rubber bristles are wearing down slowly."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,My black lab puppy is not a fan of being brushed with a comb so I bought this with the thought that maybe she would tolerate it better and she LOVES IT. Strongly recommend for anyone who's dog does not like being brushed. I'm amazed how much hair this thing removes every time.
2,Does Not Work For Me,"I have used this brush for a year now on my dog and cat, but am now fed up and looking for a different brush. My dog is a retriever/german shephard mix but she has very short, coarse hair and this brush seems to pull out some of the undercoat but then does not hold on ""like a magnet"" as promised. Most of the hair ends up on the floor or in clumps on her backside and tail. Also, I can brush her for a good half hour and 10 minutes later I will see more loose hair. The brush works sightly better on my cat as far as grabbing on to the hair (he has a lot of very thin hair even though he is a short hair). Still though, most of the hair that the brush removes has to be hand-picked from his body or the floor. I would not recommend this product."
4,pit bull approved,This brush looks pretty strange. I was like how in the world does this get hair off my short haired pit bull pup. Surprising it works. The hair sticks to the little cone bristles. My dog likes it but sometimes wants to eat it because it looks like a toy. Overrall I like it because it makes his coat soft an smooth. Good buy!
2,It does NOT pick up the hair,"The brush works well at bringing all the loose hair to the surface, but it does NOT pick it up!"
2,I returned this,"Not that it is a bad product, but I could use my hands to get as much hair (shedding) off my dog, so I really felt this product would not benefit me."
4,Pretty good brush,"The first one I received was disgusting.... It had some black ""ink"" or something all over it. The brushes had some gunk on it as well. I returned it and ordered a replacement. Since I have a Prime account it came in two days. It was shipped in a differntly original was in a box, this was an envelope. The item was in great shape second time around. I have two Pits that hate being brushed. However with this product they really enjoy it. They are starting to shed a bit this time of year and I use it daily. I would imagine if you have a dog with alot of hair you would have great results. I would give 5 stars if the first one arrived in proper condition."
4,Removes a ton of loose fur!,"I have a foxhound with short bristly hair that sheds a lot and gets stuck to everything. I used the zoomgroom on her and it removed a ton of hair and she is smoother and not shedding as much. She really seemed to like being brushed with it and there were clumps of hair everywhere when I was done. I have to groom her outdoors though, because it makes a huge mess. Her hair does not get caught up in the brush, it really just clumps and flies all over the place. She was also quite oily (hound dog thing) when I was done and I needed to give her a bath. But all in all, I am very happy with the product because my dog's coat looks great and she is shedding less after using it.PS--I also have 3 cats and they wouldn't let me brush them with this at all, even though they normally love being brushed"
5,Great Bargain,"This set is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. I prefer it to the metal versions, and the price can't be beat."
3,Cooking Trays are adequate,"This does exactly what you need it to do. They are no frill, pieces of plastic trays that hook onto each other for easy movement from one tray to the other. I use it often and it was a worthy purchase."
2,Not dishwasher safe,"The description states that these trays are diswasher safe. When I put them in my dishwasher, they came out with a warp in the hook so they no longer fit together. I wish I had bought the stainless ones."
3,Harajuku Girls You got some Wicked Style,"""I like the way that you walk; I like your wicked style"" I loved this concert live, truly brings the Alice in Wonderland meets Harajuku costumes come alive. She was pregnant during this tour! Can you believe it? Can't even see a bump!"
2,Lyrically lacking catchy pop/rock.,"BLUESIDE is the highlight. After that this CD falters due to the fact that this band needs direction. The songs are constructed in a way that halfway through the album they start to really sound the same. The lyrics are teenage notebook meanderings that don't support the guitar pop catchiness that is this act's strong suit. They surely have the right idea, a crisp production with some strong hooky moments (mostly in track 1), but they need to reach down and harness some of the talent that lies deep within. Until then they just seem average."
3,What's with all the Five stars,"...Actually it's a pretty good cd. At times it reminds me of Weezer, at times it reminds me of some of the newer British rock bands, sometimes Phantom Planet.. Almost always, I say ""this sounds kind of like..."". So it's a good cd, just that. Good. Not 5-star-great. It's nothing groundbreaking. Just good popular rock and roll - 3 stars though."
3,Something a Little Upbeat,"To be honest, I really didn't know much about Rooney when I first heard the song Blueside, which i thouroughly enjoyed; so I sampled a few tracks and figured, what the heck, I'll go for it. Overall, a good purchase. It's nothing too spectacular; there are a few tracks that I enjoy listening to, and there are some that I skip as well. The most attractive part about this album, however is the tempo. Nearly all the songs have some pace, not to mention a catchy chorus that seems to get stuck in your head with a good degree of efficiency. While I found nothing outrageously fabulous about this album, it is a good listen, something that can be listened too in its entirety without any songs that make you wish you'd spent your money elsewhere. Definitely appreciative of the band and am content with my choice on this one."
5,BEST CD EVER!!!,"well... okay so not THE BEST, but its really fab! I love Rooney and their CD is just great! They fit in perfectly with all the bands I know and love"
5,A breath of much needed fresh air,"So, take me, a fifteen year old girl in texas, surrounded by kids who constantly listen to rap ""artists"" luke ludacris, and such...and then bands such as metallica...It's either or in the town I live in. Now, bring in Rooney..a breath of fresh air if you will, each song has catchy lyrics and a ""fun"" beat, but at the same time, they're not too poppy for my tastes. They sound a smidge bit like the beatles, but not like clones, it's a nice mixture actually. I really do recommend it...for everyone, especially those who like New Pornographers, Pete Yorn, and/or Longwave."
3,hm.....,"While this is a pretty good album, it sounds a bit too much like weezer to me... only not as talented. I guess since weezer's recent reintroduction into mainstream rock, David Geffen has gone on a crusade to find ""sound-alikes"" and pump the big cash. Although you can think whatever you want, I highly recommend The Blue Album instead.... or Pinkerton for that matter. Either one is wonderful."
3,Rooney by Rooney,"California based garage rock quartet Rooney bring back the classic form of rock on their self titled debut. Showcasing raw talent & no gimmicks they show promise to garner a strong following, without having to dominate the market. The album's infectious lead single ""Blue Side"" will be sure to attract them plenty of fans, especially since its recently been added to the MTV playlist. Its refreshing that the rest of the album is consistent with the strong performance on the first single, as evident by tracks such as ""If it Were Up to Me"" & ""Losing all Control"". In fact, the disc is refreshingly pleasent, with the exception of its sole misfire, ""Popstars"". Keep an eye on this band."
4,Had to check it out,"My very first concert ever was OK Go and The Donnas this Valentine's Day in Madison. I thought it was just going to be those two bands, but Rooney came out first. They were surprisingly good. I listened to their sample CD and dug it. I decided when their CD came out, I would have to check it out. It is pretty good and brought back memories of a GREAT concert."
2,"Sorry, but on the OC does not equal good music","This album is not original. The lyrics are mundane and sloppy. There is nothing that elevates this album over any other type of pop music. As far as I'm concerned Rooney joins the ranks of the 'killers of rock and roll.' When you write choruses like (I'm sh-sh-shaking, I'm shaking/ I'm sh-sh-shaking). Not too deep if you ask me. Do yourself a favor and buy any Weezer album. All Rooney did was blend Weezer with Surf music and lyrics that would make Britney Spears gag and slap on the name of the principal from Ferris Bueller. And oh yeah, not a single lyric ryhmes in this entire album; quite the feat. Don't join the OC egomass. Buy something that has some inspiration other than cashing in by bastardizing another's sound."
2,"Good Music, Bad Lyrics","I was really impressed by the first single Blueside, but after that the album takes a turn for the worse. While the music really is average, Rooney needs to take a look at their lyrics, because it seems that every song after Blueside, they lyrics are almost identical, applying mainly to the younger teenage crowd. The lyrics are the main fault for this band I think, if they work on that a bit, I think there might be some hope for them."
5,WOW,"this cd is the greatest. i first saw a little bit of them on mtv when they were doing that whole emerging artist things and thought ""oh whatever, they probly just sound like every other pop rock act out there."" but then i saw the video for ""blueside"" and was just like ""i must have this cd."" i got it today and love it so much. i would recommend this for anyone who likes the beatles or that kind of 60s pop rock music. this is probably the best cd i have gotten since buying weezer's ""pinkerton"" six months ago. buy this now."
4,4.5 stars,"this cd took me by surprise. i had heard a few songs before i bought it, and was expecting mostly catchy light hearted songs. This cd did have that, but i was pleasantly surprised at the ability for Rooney to deliver a few hard driven rock songs (see ""popstars""). the vocalist is very talented and the guitarist delivers some great riffs. The music is very solid. I would describe this cd as sounding like a little edgier all-american rejects with a 60's rock twist. excellent cd."
5,Great CD!,"Rooney's self titled CD, is awesome. You can listen to it straight through. ""I'm Shakin"" has some awesome bass at the beginning of the song, I have no real favorites because all of the songs are good."
4,"Great CD, A Must Buy","This is a great album. Rooney has a combination of sounds, but is original in its way. The Song ""Blueside"" sounds like a combination of the beatles and Led Zepplin. Rooney is a great group with a bright future."
4,Clocking in at just under a forty minutes...,"My only complaints are: This CD is too short and there aren't enough songs on it... But other than that, I really liked it. It was nothing substantial but very entertaining and catchy. Catchy in a good way, of course. I can't really say too much about this album except that I liked it.I will say this, the vocals are very very very good throughout the whole album. The lead singer Robert Carmine has a soothing voice very enjoyable, the guitars and the arrangement of the music isn't bad at all either.Best tracks (to me) are:1. Blueside (my favorite track on the CD)2. Stay Away (the vocals are the highlite on this track)5. Popstars (an interesting track)9. That Girl Has Love (kind of sad)11. Losing All Control (mellow = good)Basically, the only advice I would give these guys would be to lengthen their songs or put more songs on the album..."
2,Successful newcomers?...maybe not yet.,"If your looking for a California grungy pop band, Rooney is certainly not what your looking for. The first track on the album is Blueside (appropriately) as it is the only song worth your time. All the others are youthful with easy to write lyrics, certainly aiming at a younger audience. About 50% of the songs are about ""young love"", and that gets old; the topic is clearly overdone on this cd. But the whole reason I bought it in the first place was for their more popular song Blueside. Very catchy. But if your looking for a feel good summer album, this certainly isnt it. But there might be bigger things in the future for Rooney, certainly a band to watch. They have the look down, but the lyrics are way too easy. Try Phantom Planet if your looking for a true California band."
4,"Dig it, dude","Rooney. Very Beachboys, but with a distinguishing twist. Popish, yet not popish. Soft rock, I'd have to say. Rooney is an acquired taste, and hard to get used to, but a great was to escape."
1,blah,"hate to admit it, but i was sold after hearing ""blueside"", which isnt that bad of a song. their video was cool (playing on a beach during a sunset), but after seeing that and their album cover (california flag), it was obvious that they were riding the coattails of the 'socal' image. after hearing the rest of the crappy cd i was gaggingoh yeah and they're touring with michelle branch? give me a break"
5,ROONEY ROX!,"I first saw Rooney on MTV during like spring break or something and i only caught a glimpse of the last few seconds but the song seemed interesting so i downloaded it. I LOVED BLUESIDE. So of course i went out and bought the CD! It was amazing! Worth Every Penny!!!! As it turns out Rooney appeared on my FAVORITE show 2, the OC and they were awesome. I've never seen them live but i've heard they are really really good live. Some good songs are Sorry, Sorry; If it were up to me; I'm Shakin'; and Popstarsbut overall the whole CD is amazing...not a single song to skipgo out and buy this CD now! You won't be disappointed!"
4,great debut cd from a band with lots of potential,This is an awesome debut cd. You should definitely pick it up so you can brag to your friends about how you knew about the band before they were cool. However the band has not quite developed their own truly distinct sound and has to be careful not to fall into the world of whiny pop-punk. Overall this is an excellent cd which I thoroughly enjoy and highly recomend.
4,wonderful,"This is a wonderful CD. Rooney is great. They have incredibly catchy and interesting music. So much music I hear is boring and average, but these guys have brightened up pop-rock again (though they'd probably be mad to see the word ""pop"" attatched to them).My only complaints are the not-always-great lyrics and the song Popstars, which kind of bugs me. (It criticizes popstars and pop lyrics-- I think it has something of a point, but it's always seemed a bit hypocritical to me.)Still, they've got great melodies, and they're good instrumentalists. I really think they could be famous."
5,"Good Stuff, Good Stuff","I first heard of Rooney about a year ago, the minute i heard them, I loved them. I promptly bought their debut album and loved almost every minute of it.I even went to the Pepsi Smash show they were a part of, they were awsome live, I wanted to go to their concert but i was in Las Vegas when they were here. Oh and just to clear up the ""I'm Shakin"" song, its about drug withdrawls. ""I've forgotten what it feels like to be normal, I wake up in so much spit and sweat, I'm shakin"" etc...its about drugs. i promise.Anyway, I highly suggets it to anyone that likes pop rock reminicent of classics such as the beatles and others.thats all folks."
3,Not boring but not exciting,"If you love Weezer, like I do, you'll like Rooney...who's like a watered-down pop-leaning copy of Weezer. I like this album, gave 4 or 5 listening sessions and haven't had the urge to ""pop"" it out again. Maybe I'll give it another chance."
4,Pretty Good Music,"Seemingly opposite from alot peoples opinions I really enjoyed this cd. Yes it has a raw sound to it, but so do the White Strips and everyone seems to enjoy them. This cd is very nicely written-lyrically and musically and its different from alot of stuff that is out there. I think that may be why i enjoyed it even more because it doesnt sound like every other band you hear on the radio. So contrary to most I would have to say that I did like this cd very much"
4,Cool cd...,"I bought this cd after seeing Rooney's 'Blueside' video and I've been listening to it since then. They do have a retro rock sound - a quasi mix between Sugarcult, Incubus and The Strokes. Its good and not at all boring and Robert Carmine's voice is awesome. My fave songs are 'Popstars' which poke fun at the pop stars that killed rock and roll, 'Sorry Sorry' and 'Blueside'. Everyone should buy it. =)"
5,...I don't know what that other guy is talking about!....,"I was in a movie theatre when the music video for Rooney's ""Blueside"" came on. I couldn't hear a single note so I decided to take note of the band and check them out here. This was for two reasons:1. The lead singer was attractive2. The guys looked like they were having a good time playingAfter I heard the song ""Blueside"" at their website I bought the CD. I am glad I did. Most music I listen to nowadays only has one good song, maybe two. That is not the case with this one. Dont pass it up. Who knows where it'll go.""Blueside""-catchy""Daisy Duke""-gets the message across, whoa, which is very pungent. Good guitar work.So, what is that other guy nagging on about? Who knows and who cares? Have a nice day!"
5,Rooneyfied,"Rooney rocks my socks. The band has such an unique style and I love the CD. I purchased it not knowing much about the band, and I soon grew to enjoy the music.My favorite tracks are If it Were Up to me, I'm a Terrible Person, I'm Shakin' and Sorry Sorry. However, all the tracks are very catchy and great to dance too.The albumn is great for a ride to the beach because the type of music will remind you of a more recent version of the Beach Boys."
4,not bad,"i'd really give it a 3.5 maybe. it depends on what type of music u like, but this is slowish softish and upbeat prettymuch. the lyrics are singsong, emotional-sorta, and apologizing about a bad love, or just too darn happy/sappy. but that might be what u like. tracks 1 and 5 rock; 2 is good too. and then there are some songs that simply suck or are just really pointless. but the music might remind you of the beach and its really not that bad. i know i bashed the cd sorta, but i really don't regret buying it. i hope this helped....."
3,"I don't know, man...","I bought this because it was a steal at only 7 bucks. But I kind of see why it was priced that low. I heard ""Blueside"" before I bought the album and I liked the Beach Boys-esque sound of it. But when I heard the entire album, all I cared for was ""Blueside"", ""Popstars"", and ""Losing All Control"". When I bought this I was looking for retro rock like Jet, The Strokes, The White Stripes, or any other band in that vein. What I got was some SoCal/emo rock. Maybe it'll grow on me, but for the time being, I'll pass. The logo is nice to look at though."
4,Awesome CD,"I first heard Ronney after tagging along to the taping of Pepsi Smash. I quickly fell in love with the band and there music. Unlike alot of bands, there cd is FILLED with awesome songs. I would definatly suggest this cd to anyone who has an interest in music. Their music doesn't discrimminate and i think that anyone can find personal meaning in their lyrics. So everyone should pick up ROONEY's self titled debut album! IT ROCKS!!!"
4,The same yet different,"While Rooney may sound like just another college rock band like All American Rejects or Fountains of Wayne, they do have a unique sound to them, and it is worth a listen. The highlight is the current single I'm Shakin'."
4,Rooney is a great band,Growing up a hip hop head I didn't expect to like Rooney's sound at all. But over the years while hip hop is going down hill I began to expand my music taste to other types of music. The two bands that I love the most are Phantom Planet and now Rooney. After hearing Blueside on television I had to get the album. ALthough the album is decent I've heard much better songs from them that haven't been released yet. Overall an A- CD.
4,Pretty Cool,"I was really happy when I saw Blueside on MTV. Rooney is one of the few bands I like that is going to garner immense success. It's easy to see why too. These guys have phenomenal harmonies. Blueside? Man, That would have been a perfect counterpart to so many great Beach Boys songs from the 60s. The giant hooks and rock outs more than compensate for the lyrics, but they still could use some work. As far as the music though, everything is super tight, produced to a tee. A great album for the speakers- strident and clear. After the first few listens, I was a little bit disappointed with the cd as a whole. Blueside was the only track that really stuck in my head. After a few weeks though, others began to remain in my mind, most noteably If It Were Up To Me, I'm Shakin' and Daisy Duke. This cd is really worthwhile. I definitely recommend it."
3,Beach Blanket Punko,"When Rooney first released their album, critics compared them to The Cars. Ok, maybe because of the keyboard, but that is not much of a comparison. Rooney is walking in the shoes of such artists like Supergrass, and The Strokes. These groups have been bringing back the California beach punk of late 60's (eventhough Supergrass is a Brit band). My dad grew up listening to this music, and he STILL likes it. Rooney is what happened when Brian Wilson got his butt kicked by Iggy Pop. If you think that sounds cool, then you will like them. This album is not that great but the group shows promise. Trust me, they will be bringing out the big guns soon."
1,Rooney Rocks!,"One of my favorite movies is ""The Princess Diaries"", and once I found out that Robert Carmine was in a band, I had to check it out. They have this really cool sound that I just fell in love with the first time I heard their song ""I'm Shakin"". The tunes are catchy, and the lyrics are cool. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who loves the underground/rock type music."
2,Copycats of great bands,"It never would have occurred to me to put Weezer and the Beach Boys together, but I found 'Blueside' fun with a touch of grit. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is 'wanna hear my weezer imitation?' If they'd kept with the glint of originality in blending the surf/garage sound, they'd have my attention, though not my respect.C'mon, guys. But what do you expect from the Plastic Factory known as the O.C.? I grew up in Orange County (never called the OC until the show came on, mind you)and Rooney perfectly reflects the emptiness of the Stepford of SoCal. They are pre-packaged cookie-cutter suburbia that you've heard a hundred times before. The Beach Boys had fantastic harmonies and arrangements, while Weezer is superb nerd rock. Each carved an important niche in the music biz while not taking themselves too seriously.Rooney (Andy, Mickey, just saying 'Rooney' makes my mouth feel weird) should have been a TV show band, with Zack from Saved by the Bell as lead singer."
1,clowny,"In my opinion, this album is a joke. If you even remotely like it, you are weird. It is all 60's music and not at all what they make it out to be."
1,not instructional,"My daughter is being taught from this book. It has no instructions in it what so ever. When she brings it home for homework and unless you know algebra already it is totally useless. It is the most confusing book to work from. Some of the stories in it are not even relevant to the problem or the answers, which make it totally confusing for the student. My recomendation is not to purchase this book and if you school is using it, GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE SCHOOL BOARD AND DON'T TURN BACK!!"
4,Great for Kids!,"We purchased this phone for our 6 year old son. It was extremely easy to setup and program (not sure why so many people say it's hard???) If you have half a clue, it's no problem at all. The hardest part is trying to get our son to keep up with the phone. It comes with a clip that we usually clip to his belt loop and then stick in his pocket. It only took a few minutes to teach him how to use it and we go through it occasionally to re-enforce it. This is a great piece of mind for me knowing I can always reach him. A few negatives... First, there is no obvious way to replace the batteries. Once the batteries go, you have to replace the entire $99 phone. Next, there is no voice mail. Finally, minutes are not cheap! at .25 cents a minute, calls have to be short and to the point!"
1,Horrible Phone,I purchased this phone for my son for when he is riding his bike in our neighborhood and playing at the park. The phone is easy to use and is small enough to go into my son's pockets but......the service area coverage stinks! We can be standing in front of each other and I can call him on a land line and the phone does not ring. On a rare occasion the call goes through. If there is a problem be prepared to hold on the phone for customer service for at least twenty minutes. The web site is hard to navigate through and it does not answer many questions unless you are willing to email them and wait for them to email back. There is no warning when minutes are used for the month. All in all it is just not worth the hassle. I would not recommend this phone to anyone who really needs your child to be able to answer the phone when you call to check in. Good idea but poor execution.
2,Still the phone made by 3-year-olds,"Ok, I admit, I don't own a Firefly and am sorry to everyone who got the wrong idea from my incorrect data. (it, unfortunatly, came from an unreliable and anonymous source). Sure,I still think that(compared to other prepaid phones) is a rip-off for people under 12. Every one of my friends have phones from Sprint, Nokia, and Nextel. After careful consideration, I have decided that it just depends on how old you are to use it. Once again, sorry for the wrong info."
1,NO WAY!!!,"If I would buy this in the future for my kids, they would be laughed at!!!! My bests friend's over-protective parents bought her this cell phone, now SHE IS THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL!!!!! Ok, Ok this phone is good for ages 5-8 but preteens and teens do not need this, this is an embarassment for them, and to my bff, now they call her ""Baby Brat, Baby Brat"". When I was in 4th grade I had a Nokia cell phone, the same phone as my mom!!!! So please if you are going to buy this for your kid, please, oh PLEASE dont give it to a 13 year-old. Oh I woulnt even give 1 star for it, maybe like a negative 1 million!!!!"
4,GREAT DRILL,I've used this drill for a couple of years and love it. Only used the saw a couple of times but was very pleased with it also. I owned a 18 volt Dewalt drill and it is no where near the performance of the Panasonic drill. The Panasonic lacks a couple features I would like - like an level and an extra bit holder. One of the batteries died a few months back - bottom line is you can get a new drill kit for about the same price as 2 replacement batteries
4,A 'Maybe you'll want to go and see/hear for yourself' DVD,"The dvd approaches you on two levels. The obvious first, telling you of 'Ghosts' and a few specific locations. It is not a series of indepth paranormal investagations, but rather a telling the stories of the apparent hauntings, both how they originated and what is being experienced now... which leads into the second, as a tourism DVD. What will you see if you travel here? What will you here if you stay the night there? Will something be watching you after you watch the DVD?"
2,Ghosts of California,I did'nt finish Watching it but when Iam done i will let you know if i Hated it or liked it ok
3,book as described,the book came as described (used) though it came with a huge cut on the cover that also tore through the first few pages
4,Friend & Lover - 'Reach Out Of Darkness' (Collector's Choice),"Originally released in 1968, as this was the sole lp by the husband and wife duo of Jim Post and Cathy Conn - from Alberto, Canada. Tunes I got the most out of were ""I'm A Man, You're A Woman"", the album's title cut ""Reach Out of Darkness"" (I certainly remember this song - although until now I never knew who performed it), ""Ode To Dandelion"" and ""If Love Is In Your Heart"". Thought that this lp's eleven tracks definitely possessed a psych, pop and sort of a soul element. Recommended for fans of Jefferson Airplane, Mamas & The Papas, Simon & Garfunkel and possibly The Association or the Fifth Dimension."
1,not compatable with a billet MSD distributor,I had to return the gear for the following reasons: the inside diameter was a slip fit on the shaft and the roll pin diameter and the hole in the distributor are a lot bigger than what is on the MSD. This gear might work on a stock distributor but I can't attest to that so you're on your own.
1,Hunting for a Plot,"It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it into obscurity."
5,Breathe is the best song of the year!,"If you are in love, this is the perfect song. If you like happy songs, this is the perfect song. If you like very nice rhythm, this is the perfect song. Plus the second song on the single ""It all comes down to love"" is very catchy. I would recommend this cd to anyone that likes music."
5,Love it!,"This is a really great song, and Faith Hill's biggest hit. Deservingly so, it's the perfect crossover song. Let's face it, it would be a crime to confine Faith Hill to country music. Her voice is clearly strong and it would be wrong to ask or except her to fit a certain sound just because it's what she's done in the past. I say she can only get better with each album, and grow as an artist, as she has. This is a CD single worth buying. You get the pop version of the smash hit ""Breathe"". You get a nice b-side, the uptempo and positive ""It All Comes Down To Love"", and another song from the BREATHE album titled ""What's In It For Me"", where Faith asks her man what's in it for her if she sticks around. Great stuff!"
5,WOW!,"I'm not a fan of country music i only like shania twain's music. But when it comes to this song.......this song is brilliant she has done brilliant job on this song.she sings very well......It's just as good as ""This Kiss""."
5,must see for every candy-fan,"this is a great box-set, with 3 60-minute-tapes containing the best footage from big city comedy.It's never been on television here in the Netherlands, but I bought it anyway because I'm a huge John Candy fan.I wasn't disappointed, it is hilarious; great scenes, great sketches with guest appearances of Joe Flaherty, Billy Crystal, Rita Moreno, Jimmy Walker, Fred Willard, Betty White, Martin Mull, Conrad Bain, Margret Trudeau also starring Tim Kazurinsky, Tino Insana, Don Lamont, Patti Oatman, Audie Neenan.If you love John Candy, you'll definately love this!A great collection, every fan should have.Buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,It does a fantastic job and it's cheap!,"This thing has been very helpful for hanging pictures. The 2-foot length is perfect for my needs -- not only can I use it to evenly space out nails in the wall, I can just set it across two frames to make them both level."
5,Perfect for a job...,Sometimes you just need a shorter level such as this 24 inch Stanley.Used to install iron hose reel...level and impressive!
4,Panasonic 15.6 Vold NiMH 1/2 Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit,The reviews I read before purchasing this item are exactly correct. The drill is really great. The only thing I wish it had was a light on the front for getting into small dark places.
2,too heavy w battery to work,doesn't come w drill bits n the item is way too heavy to do high window treatments.
2,disappointed,"I read a review of this gun in my Union Carpenters Magazine and bought it on their recommendation.But they must have only used that gun for a week. It was fine when new.In just over a year of not much use, the batteries wore out,the trigger sticks and the transmission whines.I called Panasonic and they told me I was out of luck. My 5 year old DeWalt 12 volt cordless held up better. I will never by anything made by Panasonic again"
4,Panasonic Performance,"The drill works well under all phases of cabinetwork. Not designed for heavy-duty construction (i.e., heavy drilling of concrete or hi-torque needs) it's a marvel in the shop with battery change @ about 7hrs. continual use.Holds its own compared to the DeWalt and w/ battery life comparisons, surpasses it, as the Nimh speaks for itself.Compared to the Makita, the 15.6 is on par w/ the 12.0 cordless, also equipped w/ the Nimh batteries. The Makita 14.4 & 18v models far surpass the Panasonic in ability & durability AS LONG AS THEY'RE EQUIPPED W/ THE NIMH BATTERIES.We use the Panasonic in the shop as its 15.6 makeup is not compatible w/ anything else, and therefore is not worth grabbing and taking in the field; bought for the shop, stays in the shop!"
2,powerfull but fragile,"I am a Builder, and have three of these. Each has a problem..One has a broken Chuck as I tightened a bit in it that was off center and broke one of the three tines, I have another that smells burned out and over heats probably from over use, and a third that I dropped Damaging the internals,, I also have several Batteries that wont charge. Problem is that I use the Panasonic skill saw every day, I also use the drill but it is not well balanced and can easily fall from a tool apron...The Batteries are so expensive.. It is actually cheaper to buy the drill kit than it is to buy the two batteries..."
2,Good while it lasted,"I bought the drill 2 years ago.It was kept inside the house.I used it occasionally.It worked well.Now, neither battery will hold a charge.I am unimpressed."
2,I thought I had a Good Drill Until the Batteries Died...,"I bought this drill two years ago and I was a big fan of its excellent balance, weight, and build quality. The RPM's were fair and the chuck was difficult to tighten, but it was a pleasure to use. I was also blown away at the lasting power of the 3.5 Ah batteries, that is until they recently stopped working after only 10-15 minutes of moderate use. Most reviews probably don't capture this problem because most were written within the first year. I really liked the drill but I am extremely disappointed in the battery life. I am kicking myself for not following the advice from the few reviews that warned of this battery life problem. I no longer believe this was just bad luck."
3,The chuck is the weakest aspect of this drill,"I bought this drill to replace my ancient Makita 7.6V drill.I used the drill today to screw concrete forms together, and I was not at all happy with the chuck, although the drill had lots of power and torque. The chuck would not grip a hex-shank phillips screw driver bit tight enough to prevent it from sliding into the chuck. The Makita with a keyed chuck never had this problem. I often use short bits in a drill-driver due to clearance problems, when the body of the drill plus the height of the bit is an issue. If I had realized this prior to purchase, I would have looked for a drill with a keyed chuck.-Dave"
5,Workhorse,"Over the last 18 years, I've had multiple manufacturer's drill/drivers in my custom furniture shop. The one recently pruchased is the mate to one already in the shop....which I've had for years and has already taken it's share of abuse. The power of this drill is equal to higher voltage competitors....well worth the cost.Not only does this drill come fully charged, it stays upright when placed on a work surface.The ratcheting chich takes a bit to get used to at first...it's noisy."
4,4 STARS IN CASE THERE'S ANTHING BETTER (I DOUBT IT),"Have worked as a carpenter/framer for 6 years. Have used Bosch, Dewalt, Makita cordless drills. Have used this Panasonic drill for 1 year now. VERY IMPRESSED.Battery charge lasts longer BY FAR than any other drill I've ever used. Strong motor, light, compact, well-balanced, comfortable. Wide battery makes good base when the drill is set down. Chucking a bit is a little more fussy than with other drills, but is a very minor drawback. May not be quite as strong as some other drills but, if you need more power, you should be using a corded drill anyway.Everything about this drill is very good or excellent. Battery life is the best!!!"
2,Won't last,"I bought this drill in Sept 2008. It was billed as the best at the time - and it is a great drill as far as torque and quality motor/gear construction. My complaint has to do with the batteries; they barely hold a charge now - and I expected better for a $190 drill. Replacement batteries are overpriced, so I have to replace the drill. I won't be replacing with a Panasonic."
5,"So far, so good!","This review is only after having had the drill about 3 weeks. So far, it's all I expected. Like the weight and especially the grip -- which is a little smaller than my old drill, and a better fit for my hand. Like the fact the bottom is flat, so it sits down (upright). Especially like the chuck and the way that it ratchets as you tighten. You can really snug it up to a bit shank good and tight."
5,Great Drill,"I got this drill to do some home improvement projects, and it has only impressed me. It is light, powerful, and can do any job you throw at it. The batteries (2) also last a LONG time, so no need for changes during awkward installations. You wont be disappointed!"
5,Great drill!,"This is a great all-around drill. Top rated by CR, adn I understand why. Great torque and long battery life. It has very good ergonomics... except for one very small quibble. The forward-reverse switch can easily be depressed accidentally.Otherwise absolutely no complaints. It's a well-ballanced and powerful tool."
1,Amazon.com's Serious Misrepresentation,"In the product detail, Amazon states that this product was made in Japan, as it should since this is a trademark Japanese brand name, so I ordered one.But the actual product I received was made in Mexico. I contacted Amazon for a resolution since I placed this order with a promotional certificate. Twice I wrote politely to Amazon.com but I have never received any reponse! They completely avoided my inquiry for the misrepresentation of the country of manufacture.I think many customers would simply not have made the purchase had they known the misrepresentation of such nature, because the country of manufacture Does matter for such products as all the true professionals know well.Since the return for such heavy items are very inconvenient. Some will just settle even when they deserve a better solution. Shame on Amazon for such misrepresentation and intentional avoidance to correct the mistake."
1,Panasonic should stick to TVs,"I bought the 15.4 volt for around the house,probably had about 3 hrs of run time on it and the motor fried,emmiting smoke. But since its out of waranty theres nothing i can do. So now i have 2 batteries i cant use. WE run DEwalts in our commercial cabinet shop and in 2 years the only problem we have had is the batteries give out,but only 1 or 2 of them. So I vote for dewalt and think that panasonic should stick to building TVs."
3,"Stop showing the large saving that we will get,","You show savings of 100.00 to200.00 dollars off of most Items, What are you comparing your prices to? Most of your prices are within a few bucks of everbody else price. You say we save x amount of dollars off of retail, thats Bs No we don't, Explain your savings please, when I go into local stores I don't see these savings."
1,0 stars,The reversing switch is of defective design! period! Do Not Buy This Tool! Consider yourself forwarned!!!!
2,Overpriced !!.. Buy if you can afford it..,"there are other one's like Dewalt and Bosch , which will last equally or longer and cost less."
3,Eggbeater!,"Well, I couldn't find much use for this. I am unbelievably lazy at times and when my girlfriend asked me to build cabinets I just had to act like it was broken. So, one day I decided to make her breakfast in bed and I couldn't find the right utencils. I ventured into the garage where I left my Hyperformance drill and when I returned to the kitchen with it I found that it makes quite a good eggbeater."
5,This drill gets 6 stars,"My first Panasonic (EY6432NQKW) lasted 7 years under heavy use. Fabulous torque, battery life, ergonomics, balance. Not much of a factor in purchasing it, it's shorter length proved invaluable in many situations. This thing drives screws through several inches of dimension lumber for a long time on one battery charge. Very impressive. The chuck clutch finally gave out, but I quickly bought this new Panasonic, and also another mfgr's lithium model. The new Panasonic (like the old one) blows it away. My only complaint is that the batteries tended to fall off the drill in later years so I had to add a round of blue tape at battery changes. Admittedly, the drill dropped several feet a couple times to a hard surface. A slide-on battery would be a more robust approach. But it's the best drill out there none-the-less."
4,Good size and weight - annoying chuck tightening clicks,"Bought this based on CR recommendation of size, weight and battery life. Used it for first time putting up some closet shelving - not a very strenous test - but worked well. Don't have any read on battery life yet.Only minor issue was getting used to the clicking noise when you tighten up the chuck onto a drill bit."
5,Feels good and plenty of power,The drill feels good in the hand and has as much torque and power as is necessary for woodworking. I wish bit storage was on the exterior of the drill motor casing instead of inside the battery case. The latter place makes storage and access too cumbersome to use. Kind of a minor complaint given the tight feel and power. The size of the unit is great for toolboxes and carry alls. And it is stable when sitting on its battery. Batteries last longer than my 12v NiMH's. I'd buy another with no hesitation.
4,"Excellent overall, but annoying location for the driver bit.","This is an excellent drill overall. Has enough power for nearly all jobs. Batteries charge quickly and last a long time for NimH batteries. The screwdriver bit slot is under the handle, which means you need to remove the battery to retrieve the bit or put it away. Since the battery takes some effort to unlatch, this makes it a pain to put the driver bit away or get it out. Presumably, this was done as a safety thing, but it's just annoying."
3,Fair Ergonomics,"Ergonomics:I disagree with the reviews that say this drill is well balanced. (I've had two other cordless drills and numerous corded ones.) If you're trying to do level drilling or driving screws, the drill tends to tilt down.If you are changing bits often, the effort the chuck takes to turn gets tiresome, but it does hold bits tightly. I may have to invest in a quick release system.There is a holder for one small bit, BUT it's in the handle under the battery! That's poor design. Also for as much as I paid for the drill, I was irritated that Panasonic was too cheap to include a screwdriver bit.Power and other stuff:It does have plenty of power. I found that the torque settings actually worked (unlike previous drills) to prevent stripping screwheads."
4,Good drill but more time will tell,I just got this drill and it feels very well made and powerful. It feels good in you hand and is well ballanced. So far no complaints but I need to have it a longer time to really judge its long term performance. Based on my research this item should perform very well.
5,Panasonic cordless wonder,Very satisfied with this product! All the positive reviews were right on the money.
5,Zen cable,Product is a generic product and compatible with the Zen product I own. It functions differently than the Zen product but works as well as the original product purchased for the Zen. An economical purchase overall.
4,Should have got the car charger too,Works great! Nice price. My only regret is that I should have gone for the set with a car charger.
3,Repetitive and preachy,"If Carl Sommers wants to catch the imaginations of children, he needs to learn the art of subtlety, and of storytelling. This story, with its repetitive hammering of the 'It's what's inside that counts' message is certain to make any halfway intelligent child roll his or her eyes and toss it aside as yet another piece of adult propaganda. There is absolutely no character development or personality--the bugs only exist to blurt out their lines and platitudes.So, why did I give it three stars? Because I felt the ending had merit. Sommers actually let go of the bludgeon for half a second and came up with an effective line.""Sorry,"" Katy called back (to the repentant bugs, as they are left behind.) ""If you didn't like me when I was a caterpillar, you wouldn't like me now. I'm still the same inside.""That line was ALL that was really needed to get the idea across, without all the previous hounding and nagging.Subtlety. That's how you make kids WANT to listen."
2,Good but not great,"This book has a good message, but unfortunately the language is stilted and the illustrations are amateurish.I can think of other books, especially Dom Deluise's ""Charlie the Caterpillar"" with almost the same message and a much better presentation. While children do need to be taught to see beyond appearances, I think the author could have used a little subtle editing to pair down the text so that it flows instead of chugs along. Also, while children do enjoy cartoonish characters in their books, there's no reason why they can't be good quality art -- see Eric Carle or Steven Kellogg for excellent examples of fine illustrations.This is the first of the Sommer-time books I've seen, and I wouldn't go out of my way to see the others if they're of the same quality. Teaching values and morals is an excellent goal, but that goal shouldn't be achieved at the cost of the story. Check your local library or bookstore for better books if you want to teach your kids how to behave."
1,LEGEND MULTILATES ANOTHER FILM!!!!!,"To begin with, the one-star rating is for Legend, not the film. The film itself is great. After seeing the garbage they put out, I know to stay far away from anything they colorize. I only looked at this to see the so-called original B&W version they had supposedly restored. It was anything but original. It's bad enough they stuck their own name on the film and changed the title. Unbelievely, they actually edit scenes OUT of the film and call them deleted scenes. Even with the colorized version on the disc, this would have been acceptable if the B&W version had not been changed also. Colorization is a scourge which should be wiped off the face of the Earth. What Legend did to this film and others is a travesty. Get the VCI version for a complete film."
3,go black and white !,well this isn't the Bishops Wife... but it is a passable entertainment ! on the DVD you have the choice of colorized or original black and white i say go black and white cause the colorized sometimes comes across as too dark the special effects are passable for the age of the film and after a while i stopped thinking about the gypsy woman in the WOLF MAN every timw Maria popped on to the screen ! and you will too interesting extras too include Bob Hope and Bette Davis for vintage war bond and christmas seals comercials - a bit of like a time travel back to world war two times at the movies ?movie trailers and deleted scenes ! worth the cheap price under 10 bucks i hear !
2,Qualityis bad,"I ordered one in color for myself and one for a friend. I really like the movie, but at around 102 minutes, the DVD freezes, skips, and I never get to see the ending. I had to keep stopping it to make a scene selection in hopes I could get past the bad part to see the ending, but it just kept freezing up and skipping. I had purchased a B&W one a couple years ago at a store; it did the same thing so I just thought it was a bad DVD. Evidently not; it appears the original that is being used to make the copies is bad. I don't recommend spending your money on this DVD unless the problem can be repaired."
4,Better than the crap comming out of Hollywood these days.,"Good old fanshion movie for the whole family. No four letter words, no over the top special effects, just acting."
2,Oh well!,"I thought this would be a cute oldie, but it was not very good. I watched it once, and I doubt I will watch it again."
2,EDITED and re-titled version of BEYOND TOMORROW,"This film is 1940's BEYOND TOMORROW, presented here as BEYOND CHRISTMAS in an edited version, removing several minutes of footage. Both colorized and B/W versions are included. The edited footage is presented as deleted scenes for some odd reason. The packaging states the film has been restored but don't believe it, it isn't a great print.Instead of this, pick up the uncut BEYOND TOMORROW version for VCI. That version is a complete print with all scenes intact and in the correct place and is a much better print also."
3,Beyond christmas this movie tanks,"The first half of this movie is great, the plot takes a bad turn right after the old men die and Jimmy becomes a star. This movie could have been a classic if not for the poor story line after that. Its like ghost meets a star is born in the 40's. Jimmy becomes such an airhead that youkind of wish jean would give up on the guy."
2,Disappointing,"I am afraid I was very disappointed in the movie. The content was not what was described, and the picture quality was poor. It was not objectionable, however, not a great Christmas movie for me."
1,bad movie,"You can't win them all. Amazon sells them, they don't produce them. This movie was very dull and boring. Candidate for the yard sale."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!,I realize this is an old movie - but it was very boring - and the ending was not satisfying.
4,Good Collection,Fans of the series will enjoy seeing favorite shows and scenes. It is a real human interest study. ~ Blessings!
3,Love BB and not all seasons have trailers or tell you who may be in that season.,Would like to know who the players are to see they are the ones I want to see. Some houseguest I do not like so would not want to watch.
5,Love it!,"As a new Big Brother fan, I was very excited to learn I could watch the different seasons on Amazon. I have enjoyed the instant video of season 8 very much. I am on episode 13 now and can't wait to watch the other episodes."
4,Would be 5 stars but where are seasons 2 and 6?????,"I love that amazon has old big brother seasons for streaming, but the two best seasons aren't anywhere to be found. REALLY??? Who's fault is this, amazon or cbs?? Whoever it is made a HUGE mistake because seasons 2 and 6 would sell 100 times as many for twice as much easily."
3,Jungle Boot Zipper,"If boots are lace up this product will work. If boots have lace holes and metal hooks, product does not work very well."
4,"Ok, not great","Work, but dont zip up as well as I would like. For the money, there still a good buy though."
2,Radio Control Foam Modeling,"I read this easy to read book in just over a hr. The Auther spends way to much time on how to build a hot wire cutter,and not a lot of time on actually on ""foam Modelling.Not worth the money spent.I will sell the book for $10 plus postage."
5,Radio Control Foam Modelling,"A very good book that all airplane modelers must to read! With a lot of images, in this book the author explain the ""how to"" foam modelling, with profused information to make tools, templates, wings, fuselages, and includes the laser cutting method! Also the repair techniques are included. In the last chapter (Chapter 14) the aerofoils plotting is explained, with the coordinates of most popular aerofoils."
2,summary,To me the title is misleading. I have done some foam building in the past. It is just not what i expected. It may be good for other builders
4,Radio Control Foam Modeling - Advancing the Hobby Skills,"This is a good second book for those already familar with constructing basic RC (radio control) flying models out of foam and are ready to expand their knowledge and construction skills. The author discusses how to construct and use hot wire cutters (HWC) for foam commonly used for RC aircraft. He also reviews other details needed for successful design of flying models and how to expand the building skills needed for basic and advanced model types. The model aircraft addressed include RC models with motors and gliders. The information about properly ""skinning"" and repairing a foam wing or fuselage is well worth the purchase price."
1,should be 0 stars,"WOW, this movie sucked. I love Frank Miller's Sin City, it was Simply amazing. I saw this in the theater last year because of his involvement and I walked out after 30 minutes. This film was so bad it's already set to DVD release in less then 4 months of it coming out in theaters,that says it all! DO NOT WATCH THIS STINKING ABOMINATION...stick with SIN City"
2,Not as Advertised,"Amazon has this listed as a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo with a Digital Copy, which is why I purchased it; I have a Blu-Ray player at home and a DVD player at work, and like to bring movies back and forth. Unfortunately, when this movie arrived from Amazon, it turns out that it's just a Blu-Ray and a Digital Copy, no DVD. In fact, the disc with the digital copy has a warning printed on it ""WILL NOT FUNCTION IN STAND ALONE DVD PLAYER"". I've contacted Amazon about this, got an email back saying ""Sorry, our bad"", but apparently no one cares enough to correct the product description."
5,Very good movie and very underappreciated,"I think the movie, ""The Spirit"", which was a comic series created by Will Eisner and premiered in 1940, catches the spirit of the original series. I can see how people would be disappointed if they expected to see another Sin City or 300 and I expect as much from main-stream society. Blame it on Hollywood for promoting this as a ""from the makers' of Sin City and 300"" movie.On the other hand, most dedicated comic book fans will at least like this movie if not love it. It is over the top, cheesy, and never takes itself too seriously which means they nailed it. It was exactly what it was supposed to be and I'm proud of them for making it that way instead of selling out to the majority.If you love comic books and realize that movies are often books before they are movies, then you will likely enjoy the Spirit. Otherwise, go to Starbucks and download America's Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest to your I-Phone because that is who you are and Ryan loves you."
4,"Most People just don't get this movie, but I do.","This movie got a bad rap from the beginning. People thought it had bad jokes and acting, but what they fail to realize is when this story was written. The jokes and mannerisms are from that time period, not our own. This movie does not take itself seriously because the original subject matter didn't do it either. This is just meant to be a fun romp of cheesy, comicy goodness. Watch it for what it is, not want you want it to be."
1,Wow!....Unbelievably bad!,"I really enjoyed ""Sin City"", so when I saw that this movie was also written and directed by Frank Miller, I was really looking forward to it.FORTUNATELY.......... I only rented it.I don't know whether they intentionally set out to produce a camp movie, but if that was their goal, they even failed at THAT. This thing's so bad it makes the 60s Batman TV show look like the apex of artistic achievement.The script was absolutely absurd. I kept thinking of ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""... a movie so bad it actually developed a cult following. This wreck was right in there: AWFUL dialogue; overblown and overwrought; so bad words fail me. They haven't invented adjectives to suit this disaster of a movie.And the ""acting""?........ Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! If you could call it that! A bunch of performers striking poses and mouthing words in absolutely the WORST kind of expository manneristic exhibitionism!Oh. My. God.Avoid this train wreck at all costs."
1,Dreadful! What went wrong?,"I can't believe how bad this film is. This is the second film (The first being ""House of the Dead"") that I actually couldn't finish because I was bored. It had action but it was boring because I didn't care for any of the characters despite all of the name actors attached to the project. I really tried my best to continue to watch. Normally a quick shot of a nude Eva Mendez, and constant pans of Scarlett's cleavage would have been enough to keep me watching but even those lovely sights weren't enough. It's that bad folks. If you enjoy this type of visual style, you would be much better served watching Sin City again. If you haven't seen Sin City, then you should skip this one and watch that one instead."
5,comedy hero action movie,"Again I am amazed by the artwork that went into this type of movie. Black and white animation combined with some color and partially scenes using real actors requires an enormous amount of new technological advance in art. After watching it 3 or 4 times I finally understood who the Spirit's girlfriend was -- the city. I always thought the country and nature to be beautiful and could not understand how anyone could think the city was beautiful to some people. I guess one becomes accustom to that which one grew up as a child which is familiar to them. This theme has been in other movies as well such as 'Nine Lives'. As a child comic books were like the funny papers -- funny. This movie puts comic back into mix of hero movies which seemed to have died. There is also no shortage of beautiful women such as Eva Mendes, Sarah Paulson and Scarlett Johansson and stupid muscle men. Overall I give it a 10 in entertainment value."
3,"Not for everyone, but a lot of fun","A lot like a Frank Miller comic, The Spirit wont be for everyone. The first time I saw it, I wasnt sure if I liked it or not. There are alot of things about it that are actually what like to call ""smart funny"", it wont crack you up but its VERY clever and well written. The women in the Spirit are very much like their inspiration in the original Will Eisner comics. There are stand out performances from Eva Mendez, who vamps it up and is completely engaging in the role. Scarlett Johannsen, equally charismatic plays it samart and funny. Samuel L Jacksons Octopus is a ton of fun, and Jackson fans will love it. Gabriel Macht does a great job in the title role. Hardcore Spirit fans will be disappointed he doesnt wear his trademark blue suit. Miller is able to explain this in the extra features, and in the commentary. Over all solid, not a complete knock out of the ballpark, but solid."
1,Worse written dialog in the last 20 years,"The movie is one great disappointment and a waste of the great talent of the actors due mainly to the dialog and plot. The technical special effects are OK, but they do not save the movie.In addition, the Blue Ray version seem to be having an authoring problem; when playing in the Sony BDS player, the first time you run it, it gives you an error message that it cannot play the format, it is after a second or third try,The Spirit (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray] that it actually runs."
4,ComicSide,"I completely agree with the above reviewer, if you ""know the character"" of The SPIRIT you'll enjoy the film. I didn't see anyone walking out in my theatre though? I've been waiting for it to come out, I really liked it alot, a very good 1st directorial debut for FM. He stayed true to Will Eisner's roots basically, unlike that IDIOT Bryan Singer - who has bastardized the XMEN & SUPERMAN franchises. Though this will likely be a standalone film with no sequels, I like the 'inner monologues' of talking to the city. Could've done without the clones, but whatever. Its a definite SUPERHERO MOVIE buy>"
2,Sin City minus Robert Rodriguez equals...,"I remember when Sin City had first come out, it was regarded as Robert Rodriguez's best work yet. Many nay-sayers argued that the only reason Sin City came out so good was that Frank Miller was also directing.THIS steaming pile of crap titled ""The Spirit"" is living proof of exactly what kind of a director Frank Miller is WITHOUT Rodriguez.The movie looks pretty. Past that, utterly forgettable."
1,Disappointment,"I have never read the original comic but if it was anything like the movie, I haven't missed out on very much. The whole thing was kind of reminded me of the batman and robin tv show from back in the 60's. Just way too campy. The dialog, the plot, it was all pretty sad. The only saving grace was the beautiful women cast for this movie."
5,seminal girl motown group,"I have a lot of songs of the Motown girl groups but never gleaned any by the Marvellettes, as they were not as familiar to me as the others.But they laid the foundation for all of them, and had a great input from Smokey Robinson.This seems to be the most complete collection on a single disc.They had two lead singers at different stages, both excellent."
3,"Definitely some laughs, but IMO not worth $20","Multiple times I couldn't stop myself from laughing while watching the first season of the Da Ali G show. However, the later seasons have much more funny material and this DVD is lacking. If your a collector or have money to burn, pick up this DVD. However, I'd wait for the 2nd season to come out."
1,disk missing,They shipped with two copies of disk 2. I am pissed. Of course there is no reasonable recourse.
4,ALI COMES TO AMERICA!,"I remember seeing Ali on an import DVD years ago before he hit the big time here in the US. Funny as all hell! One of the few comics that can make my sides split! This DVD is good but if you want to see Ali at his best, try to hunt down his early UK released DVDs. And contrary to what some other reviewer stated here, Madonna didnt discover Ali.... he was already a very successful comic in the UK before hitting it here in the USA."
5,Check yourself befor you wreck yourself booyakasha!,Da Ali G is very funny as long as you are not politically correct or so freakin sensative that you can't take a joke. The different characters he portrays and the interviews he does are hilarious. I am most likely going to purchase the 2nd season soon!
2,some ugly comedy,"LA rap/hip hop doesn't travel well in this movie.I'm mostly embarrassed the the vulgar language, sexual content and all aroundbad taste in this film. And that it seems to originate in Southern California...Some culture doesn't travel well, ha, ha...White guys playing black aren't new, but neverhave been a very good idea.Acting stupid because it is popular shouldn't be rewarded?"
4,Diz Be Funne but Simpel: Da Ali G Show,"Da compleet first seazon of Sacha Baron Cohen's the Ali G show is hilarious at times, if mostly for the caustically funny, oblivious reactions he elicits from the prestigious and famous. Though the humor is well intentioned from a liberal English Jew, the parodist anti-Semitism, misogyny, and bigotry is unclear in its vague social messages; stereotypes drawn just for the sake of humor hold a power in manipulating the less analytic of views. Cohen is rude, offensive, and harmful to his targets but refreshingly crude nonetheless to his audience"
5,outstanding!,"Sascha Cohen is a comic genius. His three personas on ""Da Ali G Show"" combine side-splitting humor with penetrating insight into our peculiar culture. When he is in character as Borat, the phony ""journalist"" from the former Soviet Union, he is able to say things that fly in the face of what we consider acceptable and get away with it (mostly).His is perhaps the best comedy available today."
5,Wonderul,"I'm an English teacher and an English enthusiast. Whereas most of my friends are mathematicians and technology oriented, I'm much more into linguistics. This is a great dictionary of American usage. I had the earlier edition and I have this one. You should get it too."
2,Less Than Expected,"I had hoped that the book would have helped with specific issues of 'design', as to how to 'create' or 'recreate' a home into one that could heal. While the author writes well, her background in feature articles was evident -- the book lacked continuity. While the introduction held great promise, I had to read well past page 100 to find the sort of 'detail' I was looking for (many pages covered healthy/healing environments which were not specific to a home, as the title would imply). While Barbara covered a number of 'needed' topics, her coverage was not as in-depth as I would have preferred. I often found myself 'scanning' for the meat only to end up in the next chapter.While appropriate for someone who wants only to 'dabble' in the various topics, her high-level treatment might be appropriate. I was looking for more substance."
2,wrong cover sent,Placed the order for a 2007 Prius using the online vehicle selector and was sent a cover for a much smaller car so the cover did not fit and had to be returned. The material is a highly reflective silver that is very bright like a Mylar space blanket. In the past the type of material has made the greatest difference in longevity with the expensive ones lasting up to 10 years on my cars and cheaper ones lasting 2-3 years regardless of the color of the car cover.
5,Great Resource for Prospective Students,"Hi,I am a member of the class of 2005 at Harvard College and know most of you guys/girls are about to make some really tough decisions concerning college. Alot of times you only have university viewbooks and anecdotal evidence to aid in your decision-making.I'd like to let ya'll know about a series of books from CollegeProwler.com that presents the whole story. These books give you 150+ pages on a specific school and includes updated facts/figures and quotations from current students. All the books are written by current students. I wrote the Harvard book, for example.Hope this helps make your decision a bit easier...Dominic HoodHarvard, Class of 2005"
3,Good Documentary,"Unlike so many others, this is not about researchers trying to contact the spirit world. It is a documentary presentation of various stories and sites of hauntings and then you get tours of the gravesites of the stars (of course, Valentino is included). I did enjoy the DVD but did not feel compelled to watch it over and over. I would recommend it to those interested in this type of documentary."
3,Ok DVD...but not that great,"I love the DVD and found the Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites very interesting, however, i think it truly left out a lot of other ghost folklore from CA. Also, I found the DVD lacking in ghosts. It had more gravesites than ghosts in my veiw. However, i liked the DVD but, i think it should had more ghosts in the movie."
4,Worth it for some great alternate versions,"Comprised of 18 tracks from BBC sessions spanning 1977 to 1979, this collection proves to be a good overview of the Adverts' fairly brief (2 albums) career. Perhaps slightly less appropriate than a Best Of or Singles Collection, especially if you've never heard the original material, this CD would satisfy the fan that's familiar with and wanting to dig a little deeper into Adverts history. Some really great versions of established classics like Gary Gilmore's Eyes and Bored Teenagers make this a more than worthy addition to anyone's punk rock collection."
4,Agree strongly with previous reviewer,"I'm giving this book 4 stars (average of 5 stars for readibility and interest, 3 stars for critical reasoning). I can't agree more with the previous reviewer's comments; though an immensely enjoyable book to read, I was very disappointed with the lack of any serious or credible critique of the remarkable Napoleon. The book appears to be well researched, but I was left with nagging doubts over some conclusions and statements that -I believe -should have been examined more thoroughly or with a more critical analysis regarding Napoleon.David Markham clearly has a passion and love of things Napoleon. I'd most certainly recommend this book as a very good read and is very well written."
1,Didn't work at all,We tried it twice on our Danish modern style teak table with no significant change in the white areas. It maybe helped by 20% but the spots are clearly visible. We read the directions carefully and really worked at it. We let it stay on the table for longer than suggested. Too bad it didn't work because it looks like sanding is our only option :-(- jim
5,Eddy Herrera,"If you love Latin music, this is the one for you! It's one of the best we've ever heard. I even put it on my mp3 to take to the gym."
3,Buy as a filler only,For $2 it's definitely worth it's price. The only issue is that the compass must be held perfectly flat to show the correct direction.
1,"Watch out for the fat, sweaty, naked guy.","Seriously. I just saw them open for QOTSA last night in Cleveland and would only suggest purchasing thier album if you need a $13.99 beer coaster (or would like to be reminded of the time you saw the ween of the washboard player). The songs played at the show were uninspired, played for speed and not content, and without a message to back up the activity."
5,A Great Beginner's Guide to Wildlife in North America,"I bought this for a young girl who is interested in wildlife. I loved the detailed illustrations and the information included. I would not suggest this book for an adult, but it was a big hit with the recipient."
4,Covers a lot of plants and animals that other books don't.,"We own a lot of field guides, but this recently purchased book covers a great many species that we couldn't identify in those guides, and also gives little tidbits of interesting facts about each one. Great illustrations as well"
5,Thanks!,This was a used book.....In good shape. I have been looking for it for a long time. I am very happy!
5,Every Hebrew Student Should Have One,"This Bible is an indispensable tool for Intermediate Hebrew students. Some language teachers consider interlinears to a crutch which hinders learning. I disagree with that opinion. I use it as an initial tool for performing exegesis and word studies. If this tool is used in conjunction with other tools such as the Analyical Key to the Old Testament or Davidson's Analytical Thesaurus, the Word will come alive before your eyes.The inclusion of the Hebrew translation of the New Testament is highly useful in seeing the Hebraic roots of the Christian faith. Many New Testament passages make more sense when presented from a Hebraic perspective. This is the first Bible I've encountered which does this without preliminary commentary disparaging the Greek manuscripts which G-d has chosen to preserve over the centuries."
3,Great Bible Content,"THE CONTENT OF THE BIBLE IS GREAT, THE ONLY COMPLAINT WE HAVE IS THAT THE IN DESCRIPTION OF THIS BIBLE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE LEATHER COVER, NOT HARD BACK. WE WERE EXPECTING THE LEATHER EDITION, BUT NEVER RECEIVED IT.THIS IS THE COMPLETE BIBLE OT AND NT, WE HAD TO WAIT SO LONG FOR IT TO ARRIVE, AND STILL DIDN'T GET WHAT WE EXPECTED LEATHER COVER WISE, WE SAID OH WELL WE JUST GET A DECENT BIBLE COVER FOR IT . WE WILL JUST PURCHASE A LEATHER HEBREW-ENGLISH DIGLOT BIBLE FROM ""THE BIBLE SOCIETY IN ISRAEL"" NEXT TIME![...]PROSCONTENT IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN READ HEBREW (BIBLICAL AND MODERN), AND THOSE WHO WANT TO COMPARE IT WITH THE ENGLISH NKJV BIBLE.TO US THE WORD OF G-D IS PRICELESS.CONWE PAYED FOR THE LEATHER EDITON , WHICH IS 50 DOLLARS MORE, AND WE DID NOT GET ITTHE HARD COVER IS $89 OTHER PLACES AND THAT IS WHAT AMAZON SENT TO US. THAT IS SAD!IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE BIBLE TO GET TO US ,"
3,It was okay,"This language series is good if you want to learn basic grammar concepts. It's cool to sing along with the songs that are included as apart of the learning process. However, it wasn't for me.I like tools like Pimsluer's Spanish Program which teaches conversational tools. For me it's difficult to learn Spanish without it being in the context of a conversation. Musical Spanish is a great review if you have Spanish skills OR if you are already profecient in another romance language, Musical Spanish will give you a great foundation on which to build.I think that this is a great supplement to Spanish learning. I've donated my copy to the local public library."
5,Musical Spanish,Musical Spanish is proving to hold the attention of my adult language learners. The content is so easy to understand and the book is colorful and interesting. The CD is packed full of exercises and hands on activities that keep students engaged and learning effortlessly. Don't miss the index page. Stacey Tipton lightens the load of heavy grammar rules.......my students are learning and singing their way into a new language. Thank you Stacey Tipton.
1,Waste of money,"I have tried many language CDs and books. This one was one of the worst! Just the fact that they songs that they chose were reproduced poorly was the biggest turn off.This may be good for kids because the songs are made to children songs and this is probably why adults can't stand listening to it. As for the content and the learning spanish part, I would say it's ok, if you really can sit through listening to the songs. It is too primitive."
5,ONLY the box of fluffy white is truly fluffy white!,"I LOVE this product. I used to buy it in stores, but now no one seems to carry it in the powder form. So I buy it online. And it is AWESOME. Yes, Betty Crocker now makes a ""fluffy white frosting"" pre-made in a can that IS sold in the stores, but what a LETDOWN that is! This fluffy white in the blue box is THE way to frost a cake. I put it on Devil's food cake, and it is wonderful. A full 10 out of 10, no questions asked. And I RARELY give ANYTHING a 10!The blue box of fluffy white. the ONLY way to go! (And make sure you fluff it WELL, as it keeps getting better as you continue to work it.)John"
5,Wonderful Frosting,As always GREAT! Only problem is this product is not sold in the store and shipping is almost as much as the cost of the product
3,i dont know how to install it,"it would be great if i knew how to install it... or if it came with a manual on how to install, but nothing... i got a friend to hook it up that used to work for the geek squad at bestbuy and even he looked puzzled... it wasnt on correctly... but i must say the spinning feature is freakin cool!"
2,Has no fragrance,"Though the basket was put together very nicely, the products had no fragrance. I had the sweet pea set, but it did not smell like sweet pea, it didn't smell like anything at all. Very disappointed."
5,"h.de graff, a comrade of vic hillery in 5 a.d ,great book.BR","Having been a vet of the 5th i really enjoyen a well written review of the divisions travels. We were not covered in daily reports as many of the other A>D s were . We were known as PATTONS GHOSTS.Mr Hillery was assigned to Hq. CC B and later sent to an a armored infantry unit.My last contact with Vic was ar the 5th A.D. reunion in Colorado Springs this last Nov. I HAD PURCHASED TWO COPIES OF PATHS OF ARMOR so that my children and grandchildren could learn of the deeds of a cirizen soldier unit of the U,S. Army. H de graff"
4,Great Historical Read,"I selected this book primarily because my uncle, M/Sgt John Romey, served in the 5th AD with the 15 Armored Infantry Battalion. Since my uncle died before I was at an age to ask him about the war, this book filled in many of the details that I would have wanted him to relate. The writing of the book is not grand as it was constructed from after action reports, morning reports etc., but the many pictures and illustrations do help fill in the details of the 5AD's journey through western Europe during WWII. The copy that I received was obviously a reprint and the photo quality of the pictures was much degraded. Hopefully, you can get an original priting with much more clarity in the photos, but I imagine this book may even get harder to find in future years. If you are a WWII history buff or scholar, this is a great reference book. The men of the 5th AD certainly overcame a lot of obstacles. These men were tough, no doubt!"
4,flat out awesome!,"Just read this series -- that's all I have to say -- you MUST read this series! IMO Odom has passed Salvatore as the FR bard par excellence! This book is so rich in detail and characterization -- plus action, action, action -- and draws all the best from AD&D and the FR setting--WOW!"
4,Looking into a distant sea,"As I read this second book it what is shaping up to be a fantastic series, I can not help that notice that this book is not as strong as the first. The Character development contined at a some what slower rate, and I see signs that the story is begining to be drawn out (Though not to the extreem that Robert Jorden is still doing), and can only hope that the next book remains the same quality.I find that there are a lot of similarities in the general story line to a series of ""ready to play"" adventures developed by TSR for the DD gaming universe. So I recomend for those players that liked this series to look in finding the ""Trouble in Saltmarsh"" adventures and trying them out.Over all I did like this book and I highly recomend that the fans of the first should also get the second."
2,Too drawn out,Ok I picked up the first one had thought it was a pretty good book it definetly had my intrests peaked so when I settled in my favorite chair to start up reading the sequel I was expecting a decent read. I was definetly disappointed. This book is horribly drawn out. This book should have been condensed to a couple chapters and edited in the 3rd book to save people time from reading it.
3,Nice enough story with a good moral,"It is appropriate for small children as it does not have ""much"" happening, but it does have a lovely little moral about friendship and equality."
3,"Moderately Original, Not Very Scary, but Fairly Entertaining","At this point I have only read one other Laymon book, Lonesome Night..., this book was much better, but still not great or scary. Moderately disturbing, fairly lewd and not all that original... however, still somehow fairly readable. Still plan on reading the The Traveling Vampire Show, but that could be it for Laymon."
2,Typical Laymon,"I've read two of Richard Laymon's books--""Midnight's Lair"" and this one. Both of them were about the same things: young, recently devirginized boys who's soul purpose in life was to get their next lay, canabilism and deep, dark caves with a secret. But this book had something ""Midnight's Lair"" didn't--a totally pointless lesbian scene. I hated this book. I only finished reading it just to get it over with. The whole canabilism plot was there to make you uncomfortable. It just disgusted me that someone could write about that subject for fun and multiple times."
1,Into The Fire,Chapter by chapter I could not understand why I continued to read this book. This is one of the worst story lines I have read. The only thing missing from the cast was a homosexual mime.You ask why did I give it a one star rating?1. It's the lowest rating available.2. The book is spelled correctly.3. The pages are in correct numerical order.That's as good as it gets.Save your money.
4,This is a great book.,"A must-read for anyone who works with immigrants or language learners; for bi- or multi-linguals and those considering such for their children; and for anyone who has contributed to the spread of ignorance regarding immigrants, language learning, and bilingualism. (My grandmother will be receiving a copy.) It's an easy and interesting read, touching on a variety of topics and providing an extensive bibliography for those wishing to learn more. Enjoy!"
1,"Not for climbing, and ones that are start at only a slightly higher price","Obviously this isn't rated for climbing, and in fact isn't really good for any application requiring strength. There are plenty of inexpensive carabiners that are rated for weight (and climbing) that start at only a couple of dollars more. This isn't worth much anything to be honest."
1,TOY - Black Professional Aluminum... Carabiner,"This product is so far from professional, I call it a toy. The locking mechanism is poorly devised. If you want something that locks to carry your keys, go for it. Otherwise forget you ever saw these."
4,"""Not For Climbing""","It says right on it ""Not For Climbing"". Its for holding things on your harness or in your purse. It serves that purpose fine, but don't use it for climbing or other stress-weighting activities"
4,As described and reviewed by others,This is a key ring holder for me... as it is for likely everyone else. The locking mechanism is very cheap and we'll see how long it lasts but I do feel more secure about my keys not randomly falling off- which is a weird problem to have to begin with. Looks good in matte black.
4,works great.,basically i bought this because i had 4 bucks left on a giftcard. but i use it to clip my keys to jeans. or workpants.
5,Good Quality,"This is a very secure Carabiner, strong I would trust it with all but the heaviest of loads. a little expensive but I like to have quality products the first time. I am not a part of the throw away society. I would buy this item again."
4,"decent quality, a little big for my purpose","I bought it to hold my keys. It is a little biger in my hand than I thought when I saw it on line. I just have 4~5 keys, so it is an overkill to have a big, thick carabiner. If you have more than 10 keys to hold, I think that would be fine with it. Otherwise I'd choose a lighter, thiner and smaller one."
2,Nice but cheap,"this is a good carabiner, but could be a little better made. i used one for my dog's tie out line, and it recently broke. don't use it on things you need to be able to trust."
3,A decent keyrign,"I knew that this was not climber rated when I bought it, but I was hoping for a little higher quality than it is. First of all, the inside usable length on this is about 64mm, outside 78mm, so the ""80mm"" description is a nominal figure only. In standard terms, that's 2"" inside, 3&#8539;"" outside.The threads do not have stop a of any sort on them so the sleeve travels all the way to the shoulder of the nose, exposing a couple of threads on the gate, at the base of the sleeve. The sleeve can come complete off the gate, in the open position.The finish is okay, but nothing special, and certainly not permanent.If you're looking for a tacticool keychain, this could be it. If you're looking for a quality carabiner spend the money on something that's climber rated, even if that's not what you're going to use it for."
2,Don't trust the locking nut--no better than a regular 'biner,"The nut screws all the way off either side and is mostly just for looks. Since the biner is small it doesn't look that big or tough, anyway, so even the looks aren't much to speak of.I wouldn't buy it again; if I did, I wouldn't pay more than the price of a non-locking one--a dollar, maybe 2."
3,not awful,"this is fairly light duty, but its of for keys or something. the lock just screws over the end of the carbine. and theres no pin on the gate so it cant take much weight before it bends."
3,Ok carabiner,"I purchased this carabiner to hold all my work keys (includes 8 shuttle buses; 4 - fifteen passenger vans; and 3 - ten passenger vans). This carabiner lasted me two and half weeks! I mean, these keys aren't exceptionally large or bulky. I've weighed them and all together they weigh less than 4 pounds! What happened was that the spring on this carabiner literally just snapped or something - now the only thing that keeps the ""gate"" in place is to lock it in place and this can get annoying when you're having to unlock it every 30 seconds or so. Anyhow, I suppose that this could only have been the case for my purchase, but I would still invest a bit more in a sturdier locking carabiner."
2,Paint Sucks on This Beaner,"Decent beaner, but lost it's paint in a week on my keychain. Now it's ugly. Chinese crap, I say. I gotta stop falling for this stuff."
5,"Sisco, Sisco, Sisco, Sisco","I think that sisco is one of the best new artists out righ now! As far as I'm concerned when Sisco was in Dru Hill he just had background singers. Don't get me wrong they had some great hits and they sounded good together, but all artists pick background singers that they sound good with! He's way to advanced to be with a group it was only time before he broke away and did his own thin he on his own level and it shows in his songs and his peformances. That what I like in an artist so Sisco grabe as many thongs as you can and run with them Because I love this song and your image. This single is definatly worth the money and there will be many more to come! Your Fan, Marrie"
3,Top Contender Punch Shield,Nice shield for home use. not for heavy duty gym use. looks really nice but leathers kinda thin. good to teach kids with. won't stand up to professional gym use.
4,To Live and Let Live,"It is only within the last decade that most scientists have accepted that the Earth's geology and biology are both shaped by celestial events, as well as tectonic ones. Cockell has worked in both the Arctic and the Antarctic to study microscopic life under extreme conditions, and he gives us a splendid account of how microbes, which make up to 80% of our planet's biomass, have survived on our planet for three and a half billion years. He uses the 225 million year cycle it takes the Earth to circle the galaxy as a timeframe within which to describe their ability to survive everything from catastrophic volcanism to the impacts of asteroids. Along the way, he also examines chances for life elsewhere in the solar system. Needless to say, he demonstrates conclusively why microbes stand a better chance of survival on Earth than we do. Cockell's writing is authoritative, humorous, and accessible to a lay audience."
1,One does not fit all,This module does not work where the gray module is on the vehicle. At least in my case it didn't.
3,needs details,"I really liked the book but was hoping for much more details as to how to know my wife is cheating or signs she might be thinking of it. The titles of each chapter make you think of what is to come( no pun intended) and hav some funny things in it I like , but again I wish it was longer and had more detail about each lover she had .....a good read for a short story... AND YES MADE ME THINK OF BEING MORE ATENTIVE TOWARDS MY OWN WIFE........."
2,Not effective,"It doesn't work well. I bought this for my kid and we never used it after that. It don't work, period. It keeps falling! We had a hard time playing with this. It's a waste of money."
1,Get the one with NiMH batteries,"For only a few dollars more (at the time I wrote this less than $!0) you can get the same drill with far superior NiMH batteries. 50% more charge and no ""memory effect"". I'm not sure why Panasonic/Amazon are even offering this package."
3,Great drill but do not drop,"I owned this drill for about a year. It is a great drill, but it has a very heavy battery. This weight tends to make it difficult to keep in a holster, which I need to do. It has fallen out twice for a drop of about 5 feet onto a hard surface and now the chuck is broken beyond repair.I tried a couple different holsters, but the heavy battery keeps making it difficult to keep solidly in the holster."
1,A little creepy,"I found this book and its sequel slightly disturbing even as a kid. It seemed to be encouraging really adult behavior from its 13-year old character. Even though I was close to her age, sex with a 17-year old was something I knew was not a good choice! The movie is slightly less disturbing as it ends with a kiss, but it seemed anything but innocent and sweet to me. It seemed like a reflection of 1970s attitude on casual sex and dating. It may seem kitchsy and cute in retrospect, but I don't think I'd want a child that age watching it these days."
5,Wow What a book and movie,I recently bought the movie and It was even better than I remember.This is a great movie for girls or guys. Hope you enjoy it even half as much as I did.
5,Learn the old the way,"Having friends who crossbow hunt, I thought it would benefit me to understand bow hunting from the beginning. The fundamentals of any kind of bow is in this book. It's a great book with a story."
1,wish u were enlightened before u wrote!,I was so ezxcited to read this book but very quickly disappointed. it was a very over charged account of something less nobler.better watch the film 'holy smoke' and atleast get more action out of that.. this is a overly hyped book about nothing.
2,Mediocre,"Even though the titles of the puzzles are titles of popular movies, it does little to exercise your movie trivia knowledge. The clues and answers have nothing to do with movies, except for very rare occasions. Furthermore, in the 50 puzzles featured, the same clues appear in one puzzle right after another. Of course, it definately helps you with the other puzzles. If you know one answer, you'l be able to do all the puzzles."
2,So - So,I bought this for my husband who is a bit of a movie buff. The clues were a little more complex than necessary and not many of them related to any movie at all.
1,Vince,The DVD is very poor quality. The picture is fuzzy and the audio has a constant hum. Also the aspect ratio used in copying this DVD cuts people's faces on screen. The audio is also dubbed and there are no menu options that you can chose to change the audio to the original Italian format.
2,Two Women,This DVD had poor quality video and an annoying background hum. The story itself is good. It should be delivered in a better quality DVD.
2,NOT AN SACD,"I was not happy at all with this product, first of all it was a regular audio CD it was listed as a SACD big difference. I don't even really like Lenny Kravitz I only bought it because there are not to many SACD's out there. So if you are expecting an SACD don't . I only kept it because it was cheap and not worth the trouble to send back."
1,"Abusive, A Recipe for Perversion","This book follows the usual Proverbs-heavy formula I've become accustomed to with babywhipping books - whacking kids with sticks to get instant obedience. But also for anger, complaining, disrespect, selfishness, and even worry! This book even suggests spanking children right up until, and including, adulthood.Ask yourself, ""Would Jesus do this?"" I am certain that he showed us otherwise!"
1,Cruel and inhuman understanding of spirituality,"This guide to child develpment has nothing to do with spiritual understanding but does pervert power into control and breaking the human spirit. There is nothing in Jesus' teaching to suggest physical punishment but there is plenty of direct teaching about the power of love. All children deserve protection and love, encouragement and safety. I hope you will see this evil for what it is -- a pathetic and hurtful study in hurting others as only someone who is damaged can do. Books such as this reveal the violence in our culture and sickness in humanity."
1,How To Destroy a Child's Life,"I have fought against censorship for 50+ years, but Priolo's book tempts me to change my view: I would ban this book if I could. He thinks hitting a child is ""discipline"", yet he lacks the discipline to read the research on the profound harm it does to children. On p. 97 he writes ""Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid."" What would it take to make him see his dangerous nonsense? His own remedy is, ""... rely on the rod to drive such foolishness from him."" Would that ""get his attention""? Would he ""hate reproof""?"
1,God Commands You NOT to Spank Your Children!,"This book is a corruption of the Holy Gospel. Quote: ""You spank your children because God tells you to. A decision to spank or not to spank should not be left to your moods or whims. If a spanking is necessary for correction, you are not biblically free to decide not to spank."" ""It is the Lord's instructions, not yours.""Jesus commands you not to hurt children. Quote: ""And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."" Mark 9:42.For every book sold, this author should ""have a Millstone hanged about his neck."" It's not my instructions, it's the Lord's!"
1,Christian Parenting with Dignity and Love,"This book violates all New Testament scriptures, all principles of child development, and is nothing but a manual for child abuse. Shame on the author for attributing his distorted view of children and parenting to Christianity and the words of Jesus!"
1,Exactly the kind of thing that discredits Christian culture in the mainstream,"There is something to be said for a need for greater strictness and discipline in raising a child, but this book is not it. Anyone who has had a child or has even been a child can tell you that beating a child either physically or emotionally doesn't make them a better person; it just makes them a more fearful person.If you find yourself in possession of this book, you should send it back to Amazon as ""defective."" You won't be far wrong."
5,Awesome Approach to Parenting,"What a concept. . .using scripture to raise our children. Hmmm. . .who would of thought it. Seems obvious, huh? Unfortunately many of us are NOT doing it. I loved the way this book inspires us to raise and discipline our children using God's words, not our own. It also has a great chart reference in the back of the book with most behaviors that need disciplining with scripture references for each behavior. It is a great reference tool in discipling children using the scriptures!"
3,I wonder...is it satire or not?,"I just heard of this book, I know, decades later, but I grew up in the 50's and I am trying to figure out if this book was intended as satire or not. It could have been a primer for kids on how ""good"" boys and girls behave. People did believe this stuff, thoroughly. It is totally aligned with what beliefs were in the fifties. And not prescribing to these rigid roles would of course result in -- horror of horrors, homosexuality. I wonder what his intentions were."
1,Chauvenistic!,"This book was so blatantly chauvenistic! It's obviously a children's book that was written before political correctness or women's lib occurred... It stereotypes what boys ""do"" (be Dr.'s, fix things) and what girls ""do"" (help Dr.'s, break things). Read it for a great laugh!"
1,Absolutely Disgusiting - deserves no stars,"What a horrible horrible story - the author must be completely pig headed. Way to completely stereotype girls and boys, i couldn't believe my eyes when i read it i was soo mad. The author should never be allowed to publish anything again - who the hell would publish a story like that? he should be so embarrassed of writing such a revolting story."
1,BE CAREFUL,"This item is NOT Natural finish - it is OAK finish. If you make a mistake and order this item, thinking it's Natural finish (because that's what it looks like on-line), you will be required to pay EXPENSIVE return shipping! The manufacturer will not accept returns and the shipper will not pick it up. You MUST make the return through Amazon (utilizing USPS, UPS or some other shipper) and Amazon is INFLEXIBLE in insisting the customer must pay. So be CAREFUL when ordering! The manufacturer, storkcraft, says they still make the item in a Natural finish and that it is available through Babys""R""Us via the Amazon site. Not true, according to Amazon. Also, packaging on this item for shipping is, from all appearances, wholly inadequate to prevent damage. My ""one-star"" rating is for Amazon's customer service, not for storkcraft. But the whole setup is frustrating. Better to buy something locally."
1,do not buy storkcraft products,"I bought this item 2 years ago, and we had terrible trouble with it. It arrived with both sides damaged and it took forever to get replacements. Now one of the drawer glides has broken, and customer service tells me that without knowing the country of origin, they can't ship a replacement. I have no way of determining the country of origin at this point. These products are cheap for a reason; low quality and no support. Stay away."
2,Just pass on this one,"I chose this item because Amazon offered free shipping. Don't do it.The screws pop out, the holes are not drilled properly. The finish is uneven and it is VERY UNSTABLE. Woobley! The last thing you would like is your furniture to fall on your child!The back panels are almost cardboard thin and don't meet! In other words, there is a crack in the back of the armoire that is a half inch wide and you see your wall! The interior is WHITE ... which if fine for a white piece but mine was wood (faux wood) in color.It's a piece of junk. I would try another brand. It's not worth the time and effort to return, its heavy to ship back.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
2,"Beautiful, but broken...","I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser."
2,"Furniture -- OK, Storkcraft -- Worthless","I ordered several pieces of the Storkcraft furniture for our upcoming arrival, and was pleased with most of the furniture. I ordered everything with plenty of time for exchanges in case there were problems, too. The Armoire arrived with pieces that were split down the middle and severely damaged on the corners. I contacted their customer service department immediately to order replacement parts (as recommended in the instructions), and with a little patience got the order submitted. Since they are in Canada and I live in the US, I was told it could take a few weeks for the delivery to reach me. Well, I'm going on 4 weeks now and just heard from them that the order still has not shipped from Canada. I am running out of time and getting quite anxious about my next move. They assure me that the order has been ""expedited"", but I'm skeptical.I think the Armoire will be beautiful once put together, but dealing with this company has been quite a chore."
3,"Nice, but not great","I got this armoire for significantly less on ebay, it was easy to put together (I did it by myself in an hour or so at 6 months pregnant) and none of the pieces were damaged. However I'm not sure what Storkcraft considers ""hard wood"", the armoire scratched very easily (you could scratch the wood with your fingernail) when I put it together. Otherwise it is a very nice piece of furniture, I would not have thought it worth the $300-$400 price range some websites have it listed at because the wood is so soft (it seems to be pine). I did end up taking out one of the shelves and installing a clothes rod, and adding a few hooks inside the doors for extra storage."
2,Get what you pay for...,"We've had this armoire for a year and a half and I'm afraid its not going to last much longer. It wobbles every time you open the doors or close a drawer.You have to install your own rod if you want to hang baby clothes, which is tricky because the side walls are so thin the screws easily poke through.This line of furniture is OK if you can't afford anything else. We also bought the crib and changing table, with shelving unit. The crib is sturdy, but we've had real issues with the changing table not staying screwed together and the shelving unit being flimsy."
3,a real pain,My husband and i bought this item because it was cheap and it was the look we were looking for. We got it home and opened the box to find a few of the pieces had scratches and corners broken off. We finally got a whole new armoire and all the pieces were fine but trying to put this thing together is a real pain. Half of the pieces were not labled and it tells you to put pieces together backwards. Once we figured it out and got it together it looked great. I recommend if your going to buy this product look it over and use your own judgement when needed. Its beautiful but a real headache.
4,Choice Theory,I like this book because itrained from5years ago on how to control your emotion by choosing your behaviour and the close book for this is Choice Theory for William Glasser
4,hot!,"This cologne is very clean, just a little bit spicy, and incredibly sexy. Men, if you choose to wear this, prepare to have women leaning into you on the subway - seriously. It's worth the cost!"
4,Good Veggie Soup!,"finding vegetarian ""ramen-style"" easy-soups ain't easy, so I was happy to find these. The price is about the same as my local Co-op (which I found them at later) so I probably won't by them on amazon again.Good enough to keep by my desk when I forget my lunch. Easy to make with boiling water. This flavor is allright, tho kinda watery for me. I prefer the Black Bean one better."
2,Very Bland even hot sauce didn't help! lol,"I am giving this 2 stars because some people like bland food, but for me it has no flavor. I loaded it with hot sauce and it still did not help it out at all, lol! If you are diabetic or don't eat much salt this will be for you~ :)"
3,Extremely bland,"The ingredients and ease of preparation are great, but it's just too bland. To me, it's inedible without adding salt and hot peppers of some sort. I didn't have a problem with the texture, and the ingredients are great. But I can't recommend it because of the underwhelming taste."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this particular soup because I'd tasted and enjoyed [very much] the black bean and split pea soup. This one was a disappointment. It was a little too watery, which I suppose could be solved by not adding the required amount of water, but I didn't care for the taste either. It was bland and the texture was too hard. The little bits of vegetable were too hard even after soaking longer than required."
3,Goes to 5 stars with some tomato paste...,"As is, it's okay, but tastes a little watery. I added a squeeze of Amore Italian Tomato Paste (that comes in tubes) and that really made it right!"
3,Filling but not as tasty as expected,"First off, this soup will fill you up well because of the beans and rice. But I can't get over the sour flavor thatthis soup has. It has lime in it so I figure that is what I am tasting, but its too much lime flavor and it gets in the way of the spices that are otherwise very good in this soup.Not so sure I'll order this one again but I might try a different flavor from the same company."
1,Beware of the odd taste,I bought this product along with Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf and Dr. McDougall's Hot & Sour Noodle Soup and I must say that I waste my money behind Dr. McDougall's products. All three products I bought taste very awful and worst food I have ever ate so far. I have never experienced this kind of bad taste in my life. Now I going to throw out all 15 cups. if McDougall can give me money back I for sure return all my items.
3,Not for me,"I like the texture, but the flavor was bland. I ended up adding 2 tablespoons of hot (Green Mountain Gringo if you are interested) salsa to improve the taste enough to finish it. My wife and son on the other hand like it as-is."
4,Pretty good,"I like to take these to work for lunch when I am short on time in the morning. The flavor and seasoning is great. I find it to be a little too watery for me, so I add more corn tortilla chips and it is perfect."
1,"Bland taste soggy ""chips""","I am a vegan who cooks with no oil so Dr McDougall is a hero of mine. This soup was very bad. This was a big waste of money. The taste was bland and it had a weird aftertaste. The ""chips were soggy and weird. I would not purchase this again."
2,Disappointing,I had ordered the Vegan Tamale soup and was very happy with it (admittedly with some salt/cheese/corn chips added). When I noticed this one I thought it sounded similar but possible better so I decided to give it a try. I was disappointed with the flavoring and consistency of the soup. The flavor packet smelled kind of like chicken soup which I wasn't expecting and it didn't taste like normal tortilla soup. The soup was also very watery which I found unpleasant. I would try for another one of their soups instead.
5,My favorite McDougall soup,"I've tried many of the Dr. McDougall's soups and this is by far my favorite. It has about 100 calories and it's a large cup. I have this for dinner a few times a week during the winter months because it's very filling. Sometimes, if I'm extra hungry, I'll take some frozen peas, throw them in a colander and run some hot water over them until they are room temp. Then throw them in the cup, add the water and wait about 10 minutes. Makes a great meal."
3,Average taste,"I wish this one was a bolder flavor. It really isn't a southwest flavored as I'd like.Sometimes, following package instructions, the beans don't soften enough. Requires longer 'sit and soak' time."
5,A very nicebook.,"This is a great book for children to read or have read to. It will teach them moral values through some very nicely written stories. There is humor, adventure, and drama. I hope we will hear more from this author and J D Losey."
5,Great book!,"This is such a great book; my daughter cries out for ""real"" pancakes after every read. The book shows in very basic and simple steps how a traditional pancake (including its ingredients) is made. Hungry ""Jack"" (is this irony or coincidence??!) is sent on various errands by his mother in the process - get an egg (feed the hen first!), reap the wheat and get it milled, collect the firewood etc - until in the end he gets the reward for his hard work: a delicious fresh well-earned pancake! My daughter (2 1/2) can relate very well to the step-by-step approach and actually insisted on getting the firewood for our own pancakes after reading the book. Try the recipe-like description of how the mother and Jack mix all the ingredients together yourself for a lovely pancake which is nothing like the pancake-mix-stuff ones. The illustrations are typically Carle: bright, colourful and vivid. All in all, this book is a true favourite in our household."
2,Font too Small,"My daughter loves the quiet cricket and lonely firefly, but I have not yet been able to find another eric carle book that she loves as much as those-Not what I expected for a storyline and font was too small for a child's book..."
4,For Young Pancake Lovers,Great book to let little ones know what it takes to get a pancake on the table. Eric Carle's wonderful artwork brings it all together.
3,paperback,I can't believe I paid as much as I did for a paperback...nice story and kids will like it but I paid too much
3,"Pancakes, Pancakes by Eric Carle","Guess why I want you to read Pancakes, Pancakes.I want you to read it because it is very good and very,very fun to read. This is what the story is about: One morning Jack wanted to have a pancake for breakfast, but his mother was busy. So Jack had to go around to get what they needed for pancakes. In the end Jack ate the pancakes he and his mother had made.I hope you read this book."
2,youy won't flip for this pancake book,i was very disappointed in the story & illistration. it is not early children friendly for the young ones. my 4 yr old grandson thought the pictures were very scary looking
3,The illustrations...,I'm not sure about this book. The illustrations are the focus - and yet I'm not sure if I cared for them. My 1 year old wasn't as interested as I would have hoped. This is better for older children.
2,pancakes,"I ordered 14 Eric Carle books because I loved his hungry catterpiller, polar bear and brown bear books however the 14 others I ordered were very disappointing. I never have time to go to the post office or else I would have returned every single one including this book."
3,I love Ban & Ginji,"This anime was pretty good. Rather slow paced, but still good. It was full of action. If you like fights, you should enjoy this. The dub is subpar at best. Rich McDonald was great. However I have to say, this is one to watch in subs. The manga version is smoother then the anime, but if you are a fan, then this is a must."
1,Streaming is broken.,"This feature will not properly stream yet.Prime has added some anime: Yeah!Some of the anime is not set up to stream properly: Boo!Most of it still lacks cover art: Boo!This is one of the features that you fire up and it plays, then buffer, then plays, then Amazon tells you YOUR bandwidth is bad. This is of course a bold faced lie (Please do not yell at your ISP before you check to see if it really is a problem on your end). DSL reports says I'm getting 10Mbs and the rest of my Prime account streaming fine suggests that perhaps this feature is not instanced properly out on Amazon's streaming farm.So while I really want to watch this I'm not willing to sit through something which has to stop and buffer every few seconds/minutes. When this is fixed and I can watch the show, I will update this review.I'm running Prime through my PS3."
4,Excellent DVD,"First things first. I gave this DVD a 4 star-rating, but I think it deserved a 4.5/5 for several reasons. The Good:- Packed with lots of features. Includes 6 all new vignettes of Brande, along with a pictorial. Bonus footage includes her original playmate profile, previews of other Playboy videos, a behind-the-scenes look at the PMOY, a slide show of the PMOY, and a bonus playmate profile from a PMOM from 2000.- DVD quality is excellent - A lot of steamy new material - Lighting isn't as bad as in previous Playboy videosNow the Bad:- Too many guys. Why does PB think having guys every other shot of a vignette is a turn on? - Shots are a bit too quick - Lighting could be better - Bad, corny musicOther than that, there really isn't much to be disappointed with about this DVD. If you think Brande Roderick is hot, don't hesitate to buy this DVD!"
1,I CANT BELIEVE I LOOKED ALL OVER THE CITY FOR THIS,"Title says all... I was hoping for great things from these guys this year, but I guess my expectations weren't even met. Nude footage is ruined by extra long ""filler"" sequences. I looked all over the city to find this and I was upset at the lack of quality from playboy. Normally I dont care for the music, but the audio in this one was horrible as it ripped off a few song pitches I know (Can we say Beautiful Day?). Rent it first before you buy it. The last few reviews would agree with me on that... and the first few have not seen the stuff from years ago (ie. Jenny Mccarthy, Karen McDougall to name a few)"
2,Not Good Enougth,Brande Roderickis drop dead gorgeous but there are virtually no good segments is this DVD. With the exception of the introduction it was pretty badly done.
2,Brande is nice but Shannon Stewart shouldve won,Not a terrible video and Brande is nice to look at but Shannon Stewart was hands down the hottest playmate of the year. Just catch some of her videos and see for yourself. She is gorgeous in every way and ranks as one of the best playmates ever. So why did Brande win? Cause she is so close to Hef and thats why. Do yourself a favor and find a video that has Shannon Stewart on it. One video of her is worth more than all the videos on this DVD.
2,Too bad she isn't natural,"When I watched Inside Club Wild Side, I was stunned by Brande's beauty. I just can't understand why she got some silicon in her. Kerrisa Fare should've won."
3,An interesting and insightful book,A story about the life and lessons learnt by a beautiful and witty village girl; Kerensa's dream becomes the driving force in her life.But she learns among other things that dreams cannot take the place of reality and the meaning of life and love....
4,I also read this book when I was 12? 14? Can't Remember,"But I loved it. It's not a perfect, tidy ending, but that was what I liked about it. It had the formula of a gothic novel, but not 100%. It was moodier and more interesting. I wish I knew where all my Victoria Holt's were. But this one was the best"
2,...,"I don't know, are you supposed to like this heroine? I suppose maybe you do get a bit attached to her, but she so looks down on everyone else, I was quite happy with the result. Didn't like the book though. It does stray slightly from the usual formula, so I'll give it 2 stars."
2,needed service after 6 months,had good results with panasonic microwaves in the past and liked the variable inverter power and good size. However this oven needed warranty service after 6 months and I replaced in 18 months later when it died.
4,One Mo' Time Up The Ol' Hershey Highway,"This highly anticipated DVD sheds light in an area, in which, some have said, the sun never shines. To the naysayers I say, UP Yours! and I hope they catch my fetid drift, if you know what I mean. But for the rest of us buttwomen and assmen, let's move past the stink. Whatever you have heard, let me assure you that, with the aid of THIS DVD, a can of crisco, and a few of those rubber gloves you can swipe from your proctologist's office (if you get caught, he'll understand), you will be in for a deeply moving adventure; kind of like digging for gold, but not as lucrative in the end. Take a plunge into the deep end, just skip the beans and cabbage for one night. Believe me, it's a lot more fun than just sitting on your own anus; make a friend with REAL benefits!"
3,"Some good, some junk","Mixed review on this one. Some of the fights were action packed and exciting and some of the fights we just fast forwarded to the end of the match. Vanderlei Silva, Guy Mezger, and Igor Vochanchyn usually make for exciting matches. Some of the Japanese fighters were disappointing. My suggestion would be to just watch the final round. At least the commentary is in English!"
2,There are much better MMA DVDs,"First off, this DVD set is 3 hours, not 6 like it is listed!Overall, this was pretty boring. I am an MMA fan, and there are very little surprises, if any in this. The only fight that was even mildly entertaining was the Mezger Sakuraba fight. The rest were predictable and disappointing. The announcers were pretty bad too. If you are a Pride fan, ""Return of the Warriors"" and the ""Grand Prix Finals"" are much better.The fights included on the discs are: Royce Gracie vs. Nobuhiko Takada, Kasushi Sakuraba vs. Guy Mezger, Igor Vovchanchyn vs. Alexander Otsuka, Mark Kerr vs. Enson Inoue, Mark Coleman vs. Masaaki Satake, Kazuyuki Fujita vs. Hanse Nyman, Tachihikari vs. Gary Goodridge, Akira Shoji vs. Ebenezer Fontes Braga, Vanderlei Silva vs. Bob Schrijver"
3,Good event but look elsewhere for the complete set,"Pride Grand Prix Opening Round was a good event for its time. It was an open-weignt tournament featuring some veteran big-name talent.Grand Prix Opening Round (1/30/2000):Gary Goodridge vs. Osamu TachihikariEbenezer Fontes Braga vs. Akira ShojiKazuyuki Fujita vs. Hans NijmanGuy Mezger vs. Kazushi SakurabaMark Coleman vs. Masaaki SatakeAlexander Otsuka vs. Igor VovchanchynEnson Inoue vs. Mark KerrRoyce Gracie vs. Nobuhiko TakadaNon-tourney match:Bob Schrijber vs Wanderlei SilvaWhile the event was good, I am only giving three stars for this set since Pride has already released a newer set with both the Opening Round and Finals. Look for that one instead."
3,Fine for what it is..,"This is a good, affordable, rubber sleeve for my Blackberry pearl. It provides vibrant color, decent grip, and protection from scratches on the chassis. It offers no screen or keyboard protection...but that is no surprise, one can deduce that by looking at it. Unfortunately, at the time I purchased it I didn't realize that I have the updated Pearl (8130). It has slightly different buttons and the camera is horizontal as opposed to the vertical one on the earlier models. For that reason the cutouts don't quite fit my side buttons and camera. I was able to find one that is specifically for my phone and ordered it. I would suggest this if you want basic protection for your Pearl and want a nice splash of color."
4,MARK WILSON BOOK OF MAGIC,GREAT BOOK - Shipped REALLY quickly. This book is the quintessential text book of stage magic and sleight of hand. A must for anyone who wants to learn a fun hobby or even for the professional.
5,mark wilsons complete course in magic,This is the instruction manual that I use to teach new magicians.Lawrence O'Leary
5,A great book for beginner to stage performer,I got this book as a beginner and it taught me simple card tricks all the way up to performing stage illusions. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,One Book,"If you want to buy only one book to become a magician, you must buy this book. I did it.Leao Torre do Vale"
5,Best Darn Magic Book!,"My son discovered this book at the library 2 or 3 years ago. He checked this book out so much, and used it so much, that he literally wore the book out- pages falling out, binding broken, cover coming off! As a result, we figured we had better purchase him his own copy. He absolutely LOVES this book and has learned more from it than from any other magic book in his collection. Besides just teaching tricks, Mark Wilson teaches the psychology behind being a successful magician. This is a must have book for every young magician."
5,Great for Pros as Well as Beginers,If your a beginer or a pro. Close up or stage this is the book you need
5,The best magic book I have ever read!,"Mark Wilson is great! You enjoy this book from start to finish. It has a lot (and I mean a lot) of pictures on how the secret moves are supposed to be executed, you can't get them wrong! You become a magician in the moment you buy this book!"
3,"This is a well written book, but only for the amatuers...","For the amatuer magician, this is the book to buy. It shows the simple and basic principles of the many top tricks of the classic performer. However, if you are looking for a book that shows advanced sleight of hand and modern tricks, this book isn't the best. Although it does show some pretty good stage illusions etc, it still isn't as good of a book as most magicians say."
5,such a great album,"this is one of my favorite albums. It works well as a whole, with songs ebbing and flowing between light & dark, upbeat & somber. There are many good individual tracks - personally, I love ""El Caminos"" ""Now It's On"" & ""Standby""...""The Warming Sun"" ""Stray Dog"" & ""Vacant Lot"" are enjoyable too. The best thing about 'Sumday' for me is that I can listen to it a lot and never grow tired of it. So many beautiful melodies and strong wordplay. I can't think of many 12 track albums with this much quality and consistency. It is certainly once of their best albums, if not their best."
2,Welcome to SnoreFest 2003,"I'm sorry but do people REALLY think this is an excellent album? I've never heard such a repetitive drone. At 2 points in the album I thought my CD player was stuck in repeat. ""..didn't they play the same song a few tracks back?"" I thought.I really couldn't wait for this to end, infact I gave up half way thru. If you've tried downloading the tracks from Kaza and ended up with those looping tracks, thats what this whole album sounds like.In no way is this Softmore Slump or Under the Western Freeway. Buy those not this snorefest."
4,Heartbreaking and sweet,"It took me a while to ""get"" this or at least to get into itlike I am now, but it is wonderful; great melodiesthat will not get out of your head, cool arrangementswith a lot of Brian-Wilson-esque strings and minorkeys and also a lot of Neil Young-ish simple vocalsand heartbreak. I love this disc, much more now thanwhen I got it 6 months ago. My favorite is ""The WarmingSun"" (can't imagine why one dude said it was his leastfavorite!) Many good, memorable tunes here - verywonderful and deceptively simple."
4,I got over the disappointment pretty quickly...,"When Radiohead changed from art to modern art I was gutted - and I've not really gotten over it. I felt a similar sense of let-down when Grandaddy had seemingly shifted from art towards four-minute pop songs. However, unlike with Radiohead, this time I've gotten over it - well enough to give this album 4 stars. The Sophtware Slump was a better, more creative, more intriguing album sure... and it gets five stars as the best album for years IMHO. Despite the apparent shortage of the magic of TSS on Sumday, it is actually a lot nicer to listen to. The songs start off sounding all in the same key with a plodding, even 'boring' drum line but get more and more beautiful as the album progresses and, more importantly, as you give it further listens. In summary; although it never quite reaches the infinite beauty of the first and last tracks on TSS, it contains as much beauty of TSS, just spread out more evenly! Now I am totally in love with Sumday."
4,Everything done right,"What an amazing band they were. Having just discovered ""Fambly Cat"" I sought out earlier albums and I am amazed at this one. Tracks 2-7 are absolute perfection. I've just spent the last few hours listening repeatedly, over and over and over again to ""El Caminos In The West"" - that is a song which is so perfect it is beyond belief. Everything about that song is done exactly right: production, cadence, tone. It is a brilliant example of what happens when everything just comes together and WORKS. I could listen to that track indefinitely and not tire of it. That is truly a great experience, to discover perfect songs like these and really feel them."
3,hey he's right,"I haven't heard the whole album, but after hearing some of it I've realized that the last reviewer is right: all the songs are extremely similar. The drum beat is literally identical in a bunch of the songs, which is pretty sickening. Even so, its pretty catchy music like a popish flaming lips, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt with a 3."
4,Impressive indie pop rock,"I was introduced to Grandaddy's music through their incredible album, 'The Sophtware Slump', from 2000. Having liked what I heard, I went after more of their music, which led me to 'Sumday'. Though the comparisons with Flaming Lips' music with a Neil Young-like voice are inevitable, the band finds a sound of their own, one that is significantly lighter (i.e. a bit more commercial and at times even more enjoyable) than Flaming Flips, and indeed less dark than 'Sophtware Slump' too!While I wouldn't call it a landmark album (as a matter of fact, it has the same problem as Starsailor's latest -it becomes a bit repetitive after a while), in a league not too far from (early) Coldplay, Doves, Sparklehorse or Mojave 3, this is a band to definitely keep an eye on."
1,Cant tell the songs apart,"Every tune here virtually the same as every other tune on this album recorded at a different tempo with different lyrics. There are no hooks. Boring, bland, aimless. Everything recording in 4/4 time. Ive never heard a more boring drummer."
1,Music for men with bad beards and the women who love them.,"Critics and hipsters mock the Alan Parsons Project, but hail Grandaddy, a much inferior version of APP, as genius. Maybe they enjoy the silly ""gee-whiz"" tone of the vocals, which bring to mind a man singing to his dog?Parsons never came up with anything like ""Stray Dog And The Chocolate Shake."" This could be the Smashing Pumpkins ""1979"" played on a Casio, with it's ultra-cheesy, phony brass/flatulence sound. If there was ever a song perfect for the image of an army of obese men with baseball caps waddling to Dunkin Donuts, it's this one.There's been frequent comparisons to ELO, which are completely unfounded. The only things they have in common are keyboards and beards."
3,not this day,"i listened to the previous two albums a lot and for a long time they continued to get better & better with each listen.. so i was naturally fever-pitched to check out the bands new adventures in electronic-americana on sumday. sadly the subtle magic; great chord changes, innovative production ideas and evocative lyrics just arn't there in the same way. the opening three tunes hit you first time as simple catchy radio-pop but the rest of the album - maybe with the exception of ok with my decay and group who couldnt say - just kinda drifts off into an easy-armchair background noise. software slump used instrumental & studio ingenuity to depict a landscape where the jaundiced and angular blended with the warm and sunkissed- but without such an ambitious approach to production the weaknesses of the songwriting really comes to the fore...."
4,mellow indie rock,"when i first heard ""now it's on"", i thought it might be death cab for cutie or maybe built to spill, which are two bands i love, but it was grandaddy. So you if you like any kind of music like that, you will like grandaddy. ""I'm on Standby"" and ""Now It's on"" are both really good, but the rest of the cd is also pretty good. They're one of my favorite bands now, and i think that if you're a fan of indie music, you should buy this album."
3,good but not great.,"While this album is certainly a good, easy to listen to work, it lacks the punch of previous grandaddy albums. All the songs are quite nice but there is nothing that jumps out and grabs you like on Sophtware Slump, Western Freeway, etc. If you are expecting the rough, interesting sounds of past efforts you might be dissapointed. You won't find anything as experimental and wonderful as ""AM 180"" or ""Our Dying Brains"" on this album. You will find a complete album of good songs that are enjoyable if not great."
3,wohhhhh....had to slow down the excitement,"i had really been looking forward to the release of this album....because i had been very satisfied with their previous works...but errr...not this time. this album was definately not one to follow up the software slump...there is still that familiar voice and recognizable sound..but with quite a different twist. sumday seems to hit a different crowd or taste, the lyrics have become more basic and might i say ""cheesy""...i would not expect grandaddy to develop back with that...its all a matter of taste so if you loved sophtware slump, sumday may be a bit questionable."
3,Disappointing album by a great band,"Maybe I haven't been in the might mood for this album yet. Maybe I was expecting too much. Either way, 'Sumday' doesn't get under my skin and stay there, like the band's previous work...it just sort of gets under my skin. Don't get me wrong--I love the occasional breezy, relaxed Grandaddy song, just not 8 or 9 times in a 12 track album. It got to the point where I thought, ""How can a band capable of so much consciously release something like this?"" The album is not a total loss, though. 'The Group Who Couldn't Say', 'El Caminos in the West', and 'The Warming Sun' are all excellent, among others which are at least passable. But the other 50% seems like filler, and really brings the rest down...I honestly don't think I could listen to the album as a whole again. Maybe it would have made a better EP. Overall, the third most disappointing release in recent memory, right behind Beck's ""Sea Change"" and Guster's ""Keep it Together""."
5,Organza Favor Bags,"My sister--a lover of Daffodils--passed away in February and it was her wish to be cremated; her ashes are in a beautiful urn. When it is time to buy Daffodil bulbs this Fall, we will place a Daffodil bulb in each Organza Favor Bag with the Memorial Card attached. Each person can plant a Daffodil in memory of my sister."
4,Great small bags,These bags worked great. I put three small chocolates in each for wedding favors. Very please with the product and service.
5,perfect! just as expected!,I am using these to store jewelry in and they are perfect! came quickly and exactly like the picture. great price for the amount as well!
4,The cover promises action little deth and fanservice,Its one of those anime's that keeps its promises when you read the cover or the back cover and it does the way you depict it. Its a really likeable anime I don't really know if it should be classified with other anime but its funny and it gots its serious momments from time to time. I must add i watched it after i watched Burn up Excess so i came it being a skeptical at first but it turn out to be really good. Better than the series.
3,Average not excellent,"The glossy cover and the layout is impressive, but not much of the high yield stuff. The cases are pretty straight forward and so easy to guess.no colour pictures andpresentations does not serve to stimulate the thought process. May serve as a supplement to the step 2 preps"
4,Worth it for Kong fans.,"Great book for fans of every incarnation of Kong. I thought I knew everything about the making of the original but Morton supplies facts and accedotes that I had never heard before.The chapters about the '76 Kong,the Japanese Kongs, and the unmade Kong projects was fascinating. Even the detailed chapter about the horrible ""King Kong Lives"" was fun to read.I don't entirely agree with Morton with all the respect he shows for the '76 Kong and I think the book could have benefitted by more photos and illustrations, but it's still worth getting."
1,Una autentica perdida de tiempo y dinero,"Me lleve una gran decepcion al comprar este libro, es extremadamente confuso y deja demasiadas cosas en el aire, definitivamente no es un manual de programacion, es una simple reseña de como se ve el software en tu pantalla. Tiene un gran problema de continuidad y de logica, definitivamente nada recomendable. Si buscas una buena referencia en español usa los libros de Alfa Omega."
1,Este libro es una bosta,"Escuchen esto, si ustedes presionan F1 en la ayuda del Fox 5.0.SORPRESSSSAAAAA. Nos encontramos con los mismos ejempos y explicaciones que el libro... asi que. Si escribe otro libro, señor autor, sea mas original."
1,"This is not a manual, this is just a guide","This book did not teaches you anything about the language, is just a guite to move you into the different screens of VFP software. These book is too expensive (I bought one) compared with its content. Anybody can make printscreen of VFP an then publish a book saying it is a MANUAL.At the end, I payed for nothing."
1,This is not a good book for beginners!!,"I really disappointed about this book, I am a beginner and this book is not helpful because is almost pure words and nothing to practice and the little of practice that is in this book is not clearly explained."
5,Great music and musician,"Have been enjoying this great music since the CD arrived! I had this recording on an LP many years ago and was saddened that I was not able to hear it since I no longer had a vehicle to play LP's.....but there it was as a CD on Amazon!!! Erroll Garner, in my opinion, was one of the greatest jazz musicians in my lifetime....probably still is! If you enjoy jazz piano, you will love this CD!!!!"
4,Great Live Furtado,"I've never had the opportunity to hear Tony live, but this recording is the next best thing. While I don't think it's as good as the really strong and focused studio version AMERICAN GYPSY, it has plenty of surprises, interesting twists, good song selection, tight playing and extended jamming.What I like; Myron Dove's strong bass. Paul McCandless' signature horn sound, weaving, sweeping and leading the group in a jazzy direction. Of course Tony's slide (acoustic and electric), although his vocal sound is weaker than on his studio recordings. Especially great is the final track, Waiting For Guiteau, with Tony on banjo and a slightly differnt line up.This guy and this music is mature yet youthful, funky yet traditional, great yet not jaded with stardom...."
5,Authentic Mexican,first recipe i tried was so good; Flank steak and fresh vegetables on the grill for Tacos easy to follow directions can't wait to try other recipes
5,The best culinary guide for visitors in Mexico!,By far the most user-friendly Mexican cookbook I have found both for recipe specifics and related historical and regional information. It is easy to read with detailed illustrations. This book would be a wonderful guidebook addition for travelers.
4,Very Nice,"This is a very hand book. It saves me time as his recipes are very close to mine and my family's. My parents and ancestors are from Mexico City where you get the best of best. Some of the slop people have the nerve to call Mexican cuisine is really American Southwest or Tex-Mex. We don't fry everything or God-forbid, smother anything with yellow cheese! I've always considered Rick Bayless to be the best non-Mexican, Mexican cook. I respect him because he has respect for our culture and traditions. Whenever friends ask me for recipes or ideas of true Mexican cuisine, I purchase this book and send it to them."
5,Finally!! Real Mexican food and I mean the stuff I grew up on!!!!,"Well,this is for those of us that crave the real deal... How about a taqueria truck after dark,when you crave mexican.This book is real,not that garbage on a plate from a so called ""mexican reataurant"".He brings heat with the chilis and Flavor.His book will make you so hungry,I was and a brain full of ideas.Good read and great buy.I am going to his restaurant in Chicago!!!"
5,I love this book!,"I've had this book almost 20 years, it's spine has lost a bit of its color but it's a great book. The recipes are very authentic, there are times I've changed a recipe a bit to replicate the tastes that I grew up with but the changes have been minimal. I heartily recommend this book and if I ever lost ""Authentic Mexican"" by Rick Bayless, I'd buy it again. How's that for a recommendation?!"
5,Yum!,"This is a lovely book! I defy anyone to start reading it and not want to head into the kitchen and cook!I really appreciate the thoroughness- it's got very thoughtful info on pretty much everything one can possibly do with masa, for instance... and I want to try ALL of them!I grew up in the Midwest, when and where taco ""kits"" were about as Mexican as we got- and this has opened my eyes so much! Highly recommended!"
5,A gift that was well received,This cookbook was purchased as a gift. It was well received and the recepient thought it was a real good option for her collection.
2,"Not for the simple, everyday cook. Very disappointed!","I was very disappointed when I got this book. The dishes are not exactly what I was looking for. All the recipes have not-so-easy to find ingredients, then they all look so ""involved,"" like you will be cooking all day for one meal. A lot of the recipes call for the never-ending page jump, for example: One or more of the ingredients will include a previous recipe found on page ??. Then on that page, you'll need something from page ??. Way to much work. I was also disappointed with the wordiness of the book, and the lack of recipe description and real photos. Nutritional info is always a nice thing to find in a recipe too, but not many books have them. Oh well, I'm going to find a Mexican book that's work load is more reasonable."
4,Great Mexican Cookbook,I've already tried several recipes and all have turned out great!! This is a great authentic Mexican cookbook. I would give it five stars if only it had more pictures. Well worth the money!
1,worst movie iever saw,"This is the worst movie i have ever seen, mchauney should be ashamed he made this terrible movie, do not waste your money renting this"
3,Slow Paced,It was a slow placed. I found it a depressing movie. It was not athenticate and therefore not believable. A real sleeper.
4,The Paper Boy,The movie is very intense & a real thriller!!! The allstar cast makes it impossible to tear your eyes away!!!
3,it's OK,Very strange story. Not at all what I expected. The acting is substandard for for these stars. it is entertaining
2,What could have been...,...a wonderful movie was ruined by two of the worst choices imaginable for the cast. Spot on performances by NK and JC are overshadowed by the poor directing and hopelessly talentless MM and ZE. Loved the book...the movie falls well short of the mark.
2,Not the best movie I have ever seen,I would wait until this comes on the prime list. A lot going on all at once and not that great.
2,Raw,Story is decent and has a great cast but not sure it needed to be that raw..somewhat disturbing at times
1,BLACK RACIST,Blatantly Racist. Black Racists or some other third world source produced this childish spoof of life in the South. The yellow journal cartoon of LITTLE ABNER has more merit.
3,How dare you people!,"How dare you people give Nicole less than a 3 star! I haven't seen this, yet anything she's in gets auto-3star'd. Even though it's still on my to-see-list! The girl's too hot!"
2,Yuck....,"Horrible movie. Not at all what pew were expecting. Very sad I spent my money on this one. But hey, you gotta lose sometimes!!"
2,Yuk!,"All the actors I've liked in previous movies, really must be desperate for work to have starred in this, low class, vulgar, movie! Whatever happened to a good ole fashion clean movie, without the sex, violence, and profanity. I hated it."
3,Good period piece,"Meh. If I hadn't seen it, I would live just fine. It was well done from a ""period piece"" perspective."
1,Waste of Time,"The PaperboyShould be X rated. Gratuitous trashy sex scenes that don't advance the plot. Most scenes appeared to be played for shock value. I'm very sorry I wasted two hours watching this stupid movie. Very little tension in this ""drama"" because you don't care about the characters. Scenes of backwater Florida were good though but not worth having to watch the rest of the movie."
2,regret watching it,just had a bad ending. I expected more with such great actors. raw and intense in places but is a real downer overall.
2,Creeped me out,This movie was so disturbing that I cant believe I didnt have nightmares after watching it. Such a good cast for a sleezy unimpressive film.
2,"We tried twice, but could not make it thru this film ...... Boring","We tried to watch this movie twice, but after about 30 minutes or so we were simply so bored and disinterested, we simply gave up."
2,Nicole Kidman! What were you thinking?!,"This was a very bizarre and at times disturbing! Seeing Nicole urinating on Zac Efron on the beach actually was quite a bizarre moment in my viewing history ! I'm not easily disturbed by cinema, but this had me knocking on the door to the land of bizarro ! John Cusak played a great evil character in this movie, unlike anything I've ever seen him in. So see it, but have your hands ready to cover your eyes and a puke bucket readily available."
1,it was just awful.,This movie was just like the other movie Kiddman did about her affair with a younger guy many years back. Lesson learned? If the movie revolves around Kiddman being a sexual mystery- pass on the movie. It was SOOO bad
1,What a waste of acting talent,"Violent and disgusting, this movie is unpleasant on so many levels.Bad direction adds to the bad experience by affecting wobbly camera angles and badly edited background sound. Read Pete Dexter's novel,on which this movie is based, instead of wasting time watching this awful flick."
1,I wish I could unsee this film.,This movie was so disturbing we turned it off after about 15 minutes. Nicole Kidman peeing on Sac Efron was the final straw. The storyline was not *nearly* compelling enough to make us put up with the foul language and disturbing scenes. Unsee!
2,"Film had fine moments, but too few of them","This film had some fine moments, but far too few of them. I might have given it three stars if I hadn't read the book, but there are some MAJOR changes in the story that are not for the better. I assigned the book my college Mass Communications class, and most of the students enjoyed it. I had intended to show the film in class, but decided against it as a matter of decorum. I advised the students that the movie was worth the $1.20 rental at [a popular DVD kiosk], but not much more than that!"
1,Who would give this 5 stars? Very poor movie.,"Very surprized to see so many 5 star ratings on this. I usually like story lines like this. And although the acting was fantastic, the movie itself was just plain stupid. It could have been done a lot better. Hubby said he would have rather sat through a Lifetime movie.... Now thats bad for him."
2,Too Many Shots of Southern Discomfort,"This movie is heavy with sweat and other bodily fluids, and it’s dense with drawl. Life in this Florida town in the 1960’s is uniformly ugly, brutish, and short.There’s very little positive emotion to leaven the proceedings. The producers of “The Paperboy” are obviously of the school of thought that maintains realism can only consist of meanness – that any beauty or nobility must necessarily be unrealistic pap. So we get the bad and the brutal heaped on top of more bad and brutal. The result is the opposite of what the producers intended. The result is an unrealistic, stereotyped portrayal of southern life.There’s a lot of star power here. But the actors’ talents are wasted in this stew of eviscerated alligators, hanging possums, and battered humans. It skims the surface of all the clichés of southern crudity - like a stone cast into the ol’ fishing hole. Like that stone – you’d do well to just skip it."
1,Do Not Bother ......,"I was not able to watch this to the end. It was horrible. The story line was ridiculous, the sexual content was Vile, and it was repulsive to watch. The worst movie I have seen in a long time. Terrible."
2,Dark & stupid,"Starts out like an old southern Tenn Williams play, jumps to erotica ortries to, then loses main story for side snips and finally ends up inthe trash where it belongs. Poor Matt he'll take any script."
1,"A bad, bad taste movie.","I saw the cast and thought this movie could be something good. My mistake, this is a bad, bad taste movie. A somewhat predictable storyline, filled with unnecessary disgusting scenes.I am suprised that Nicole accepted to play a role like this one. Her finances must be in really bad shape! If you haven't bought it yet, save your money! To those of you who gave more than 2 stars to this movie: I strongly suggest you to look for professional help."
1,Horrible movie!!,We only watched it for about 30 minutes and were totally turned off by it. We had to rent it but it was worth it to turn it off!
3,the paperboy,"I can see why this movie did not make it big in theaters. The acting was fair, the story was poor and disappointing. The ending was very disappointing and I felt like it was not finished or could of had a better ending. I like the movie so I gave it three stars but two stars is a better rating for most viewer's. I did think Nicole Kidman's acting role was very good, the other actors were only fair. This was like a low budget movie and somewhat disappointing. I am glad I rented it and did not pay ten dollars to see the movie in a theater."
2,Way to graphic,Wonderful performances are overshaddowed by gruesome images that I found very disturbing. This is not a drama but a shocking horror show.
1,Awful,"Worst, weirdest movie I've ever seen. Wish I could get 2 hours of my life back and erase some of the movie's images from my head."
5,Do Not Watch this Masterpiece!,"I wasn't sure whether to give this Pete-Dexter shocker about psychosexual dysfunction in the swamp one star or five stars--or even take an average and go with 2 or 3 stars. This is an astounding portrayal that puts the genre (legal thriller) on its head. The cast is superb, including 3 tour de force weirdball perfomances by Nicole, Matthew, and Johh Cusak. This movie is unforgettable, and not necessarily in a good way. Sure, it's over the top, but not campy. Paperboy is real to the bone, pun intended. It smacks a little of the perversion you see with Tarantino and the Coen Brothers, but without the black humor."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The term ""morally bankrupt"" is too kind to describe this movie. There is nothing redeeming in the movie...period! What is waste of film."
3,It's Okay if your into that sort of thing,"It's my own fault, I didn't really read about the movie before watching it. I just knew Nicole Kidman was in it and she's one of my favorite actresses.It was very well acted, very well. And thats about the only good thing I can say. To much gore and to much sexual perversion, it must be designed for a more mature audience.I won't watch it again and I wish I hadn't watched it now. It's not a bad movie it's just not my kind of movie."
3,Not so New???,this was supposed to be a new dvd but there was a messed up part when he was swimming with the jelly fish. this tells me maybe it was a used dvd intstead. ??????
1,Horrible,I had no idea how horrible this movie was going to be. Some images i have trouble getting out of my mind.
1,Not as advertized....,"Don't fall for the Free Digital Copy.... a copy is reportedly on the disk... but the access directions are at a site ""j.mp/digitalcopy"" which leads nowhere... this is bogus and if it makes the difference in choosing to buy this video or not.... DON'T....."
2,Spend on something else,"I like all of the people in this film, and they all did a fine job, but the story just ended up sucking. There are some other worthwhile titles out now that I would suggest you watch instead."
3,creepy campy,"Film narrated by Macy Gray tells the unfolding story of being careful what you wish for, youjust might get it...and then be sorry! Good acting in this campy swamp noir, lots of twists inthe story. Definitely NOT for watching with children or others sensitive to uncensored sex and violence."
3,Where'd the plot go?,"The pieces were all there for a tight thriller. But the framing device was redundant and uninformative, taking valuable time from the fascinating story. Crucial scenes are missing, like Hillary's release from prison and Jack's coming to terms with Ward's homosexuality. But the excellent acting still makes it a good, although strangely out-of-kilter movie."
3,Very Racy,I really liked Zac Efron in this movie. There are some very racy subjects.... Would not want anyone under 17 watching this movie. Nicole Kidman was really good in this movie.
3,Susbstitution of sex an nudity for substance,The writers substituted sex and graphic images (plus mathew m without a short on all movie). I advise you pass on this one.
2,don't watch this,"It was well made, well written, but traumatic to watch. I feel like I just paid to be traumatized. Graphic, violent scenes. There is no need to put these images in your mind. We are only on this earth once, don't spend even an hour of it viewing this trajedy, unless for some reason it makes you turn around and help others."
1,Movie with no story!,"I am a fan of movies that portray human nature, even at its worst, and this movie did not even come close. Story line didn't make sense, it was choppy and many scenes unnecessary. Characters are weak and not believable."
2,A Tale from the dirty south....,"This film was watched with a very open mind, the subject matter based on repressed sexuality,closet sexuality,open sexuality and racism in the south, which has been done previously, but not as vivid as this.Lee Daniels is a talent to watch out for in the future,his dark themed dramas are cast with the right actors,but the material could have been put together with better explanations as to what made each characterdo some of the regrettable things and situations they got themselves into,instead of trying to shock you or feel awful after watching.A very watchable adult themed film,Because of the subject,it could have beenthought out more. The paperboy had the potential to be better than O.K. that is why it gets (2 STARS)will continue to support the films of Lee Daniels the talent is undeniable,but clarity is essential when you dabble with the human condition."
1,paper boy,"wish i knew how to quit you and get my money back. terrible writing, terrible acting, disjointed story, stupid dream sequences, no plot...nicole was not bad. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Absolute Waste of Money,"Was so disgusting we discontinued after several minutes. Don't know how ""big name actors"" can make such trash. Hollywood is going to the dogs."
3,Not a movie for date night,"This film is pretty disturbing. There are scenes of heterosexual and homosexual rape. The violence isn't too extreme by todays standards but is graphic nonetheless. The acting is pretty good, Nicole Kidman is the star actor of this film and she does a good job with her character. The story is average, not overly compelling but engages the viewer enough to finish the film. The real problem I had with the film was the narrator who was definitely no Morgan Freeman, very monotone and seemed unnecessary as a character in the film. That being said, this movie is not the kind of film that a guy would wanna watch with his girlfriend unless she has a strong stomach, so guys planning on renting this film planning on snuggling up on the couch with your girlfriend, pick another movie. I give this film 2.5 stars, some might like it, others will find it repulsive."
4,a sleeper hit,"I had not even heard of this film until I saw an advertisement about it being out on dvd. I saw Nicole Kidman in a trailer about the film. Still not knowing what it was about, I decided to watch it. Great performances by all the cast. Some of their best performances. This film plays to all the emotions. A sleeper film that draws you in and keeps you hooked thru the end."
1,After watching this movie I felt the need to bathe,The application to play the movie was good and worked flawlessly but the movie itself was filmed with 1960 quality (it was originally made around that time so it was a creative touch) but the story line had little aim and the overall effect was to make me feel awful and physically dirty
1,What the....,Totally strange. How did they get such big stars to be in this dog?? I guess I thought with such big names it would better.
5,a great movie,"I'm not one for writing reviews, however, this movie, by far is one of the most underrated movies I've seen in quite sometimes."
2,not worth it,"I did not watch to the end, but it did not have much of a purpose and the sex scenes were disgusting. I think they were supposed to build the character, but hard to watch."
2,Ummmm...,"The acting was superb, but that was the only reason I gave this two stars. This was a boring, disjointed, dark movie. It really had no point and was hard to follow."
1,Disgusting disagreable movie,"What a total waste of time. Raised in the South, I am tired of being presented with this characterization of the South. This is nothing but junk. No stars but I couldn't write the review without giving it one star. I couldn't finish it!"
2,sort of gross,"Really one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron, John Cusack and Mathew McConaughyall great actors but could not save this crap movie. What was the point?"
1,a lot of talking and teasing,"Yes, I bought this flick hoping to see R-rated stuff from star attraction Nicole. Instead all I'got was a lot of talking, teasing and ugly looking guys and chicks including star attraction Nicole. Then, of course, I realized I am dealing with mainsteam propaganda where talking is main future. It may be as well Nicole prime time well behind her, you tell me. Avoid."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"With all the great actors in this film, it's amazing that it is so bad. I couldn't stomach more than 15 minutes before I had to turn it off."
2,This movie is insane,"I'm not really sure what director Lee Daniels was going for with this one. The only good thing this movie has going for it is the performances. I was really impressed to see all these well-known actors do roles completely different than what they are known for. A word of caution however, for any Say Anything fans, John Cusack is so gross and creepy in this film, it will ruin your Lloyd Dobbler fantasies forever! I think he should have been nominated for an award for this one.That being said, overall, it's just a very bizzare movie that seems to rely on shock value too much. None of the characters are crafted in such a way to make you that interested in them. I think Lee Daniels should have called this movie, ""White People Doing Crazy ****"" and gotten it over with."
1,Be Careful Where You View This,"I rented this to watch on a 3 hr. flight. There are scenes in this movie that are so raw, I felt very uncomfortable as the passenger in the middle seat seemed to glance over to watch every time there was an explicit scene. In watching the preview I certainly didn't get the impression that it would be that bad, but it was. If you want to try watching it because of the well known actors (which is what attracted me to the movie), I recommend you watch it privately, especially where children aren't present."
1,Waste of Good Actors,"Who on earth would want to tell this story? No character development or growth of any kind...very dark and depressing, no point in relating this slice of life to anyone."
1,Wretched film,"Terrible movie. Filthy depraved characters. Need to take a bath after watching. Regretted. Lost respect for the ""A list actors"" involved with this."
1,what happened?,"What a crappy movie! Great actors I have enjoyed in almost all their other movies, but this one is impossible to watch."
2,A hot and sweaty mess of a plot,"The plot is hard to follow, the characters are very unlikeable, John Cusack is made up to look really horrible, and Nicole Kidman is stimulating herself in front of his character--a killer who is in prison and with whom she has fallen in love. Or something. Got that? Nope, it's not so good at all. Too bad they wasted these actors along with Zac Efron and Matthew McConaughey."
2,skip it - too many other great films out there!,"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil it is NOT! although I think that's what they were trying for. Why Ms. Kidman got nominated I don't know, but maybe her authentic makeup and clothes?"
3,Never see Nicole Kidman the same..,"I was in shock when I realized Nicole Kidman playing the part she had, I picture her a tad more classy. Cusack and Kidman nailed their parts, the other actors..not so much. Story failed on plot, details too fuzzy to keep a eye on the film..could have done with more information on the inmates past rather than his present."
3,kind of weird,This movie was a little confusing and kind of weird. Zac Efron looks great in it. I was entertained.....but confused re the plot.
1,poor quality,"Save your money, this model is garbage. The detail is questionable, the plastic is extremely thin, poor fit, and not durable at all. The frame is misaligned and the pegs that hold the front wheels break off when the steering wheel is turned. Well below the quality one expects from a larger scale model. This will be the first model that hits the garbage can before it is completed."
4,the model t ford,"We recieved the model exactly when needed, however given the procrastanation of me. We had 2 days to have it done, and there were a lot of maticulous pieces, which made it hard. All in all turned out beautiful!!!"
1,Plastic crap,This is a piece of rubbish which seem to depend on its low price to discourage any returns. The plastic smell is also highly objectionable.
3,less than it appears,"This is one of those movies that gets worse and worse the more you think about it. It was mildly entertaining despite the weak plot and lack of an ending. The best part was watching actor work hard to be stupid -- and wind up just being goofy simpletons. They could have done so much more with the roles, but Noooooooooo, they went for belly laughs. The result is that there's less there than initially appears. I'll bet that few people watch this dog more than once -- although once isn't a truly terrible experience."
2,Not Funny,"My husband and I bought this movie and were terribly disappointed. Not only was it not funny, it was a total downer."
2,not for me,Not what I expected for a movie. Hard to follow. I actually didn't finish watching it. I don't recommend this purchase.
2,2 stars and I am being VERY generous,"One star - for the fabulous cast which was ridiculously under-utilized, one - for the fact that I was able to finish watching this joke of a movie.It is amazing that this group of great actors and directors was able to produce such a pointless film. When you find yourself thinking: What is it all about? Where is this going? 50 minutes into the movie, it is a sign that it is not that good. My husband gave up after that, but I (a patient viewer as I am), kept watching till the end, hoping that something good would happen. No luck there. There was no cohesive plot, no moral, no point.People who give this movie 4 and 5 stars must be either star-struck or huge fans of Coen brothers.I am sure glad that I didn't go to the movie theater to watch this film and didn't buy it either. Thank god for public libraries!"
2,"Short, and still not worthwhile.","This is just a pointless mess of a film with no apparent point and not a single likable character. As a matter of fact, most of the characters were just flat out annoying (Ms McDormand's performance comes to mind). Although this movie is billed as a comedy, there is really very little as far as any kind of humor, with maybe one or two memorable laugh out loud moments. However, John Malkovich and Brad Pitt give fairly good performances, which is the only reason I give this film 2 stars. In the end, neither the characters or the audience come away from this movie learning anything or feeling enriched in any way. Truly the Coen brother's worst movie."
4,Simply misleading,"This movie was pretty good. The characters had little depth, but that seems to be the point of this comedy.If a quote from the movie would summarize the entirety of the film it would be ""What did we learn from this?"" ""I don't know"""
2,Hard to like,"I had a problem with the premise of this movie. Love George and Brad, but the idiocy of the plot and the unexpected and almost gratuitous violence ruined it for me."
5,A Quick Moving Tangle of a Farce of a Spy Spoof,"This is a convoluted action comedy with a fair amount of blood and gratuitous violence distributed through several dysfunctional romances and a plot on the part of a couple of physical-trainers to engage in international espionage. It is pretty funny. It goes around and around but I don't think anybody actually won. Several people in the story who are trying to figure it all out from the beginning through to the end are left scratching their heads, knowing everything that happened and still wondering what it was all about. Invite someone over, make popcorn."
2,Burn After Watching,This movie has good acting but if you are looking for a comedy... you are watching the wrong movie. It is VERY depressing. It is very dark and I was not at all impressed.
3,Ummm....What?,"i watched this movie one night and was left with a feeling of emptiness. not because the movie made me evaluate something missing in my life, but because it was suck a horrible film."
4,Worth Watching! Very Funny!,"I watched Burn after Reading with my husband over the weekend and it was a pleasent surprise. We love the Cohen brother's movies and this met our expectations. Brat Pitt is actually very funny. John Malcovich never faulters as an actor and the whole show was just plain entertaining. I would definately watch it again. Maybe not a family show,but if you are entertaining guests this would really be something to sit and watch. Thank you."
5,These reviewers are crazy!,"I am shocked at the amount of negative reviews here. This is a comedic masterpiece. I think the one star ratings are coming from simpletons that have no clue about truly subtle and intelligent humor. THE ABRUPT ENDING WAS PART OF THE POINT!THE LACK OF A PLOT WAS PART OF THE POINT!THE POINT OF THE MOVIE WAS HOW TRULY POINTLESS MOST THINGS ARE!In their brilliance, the coens were MAKING A POINT BY MAKING A MOVIE WITH NO POINT!This film is true genius and one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Clooney was a perverted mess and Pitt was genius as a mindless but fun good samaritan. If you know anything about comedy, you will love this film."
5,Hilarious,"A hilarious exploration of the pathetique. Although I am not a big fan of John Malkovich, this is perhaps one of his best performances. Brad Pitt does a magnificent job playing the role of an ambitious idiot, while coming across as genuine. The characters are diverse, convincing, and so well acted. Do not miss the opportunity to watch this movie. You won't regret it."
1,Just Bad,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen with such a talented group of actors. It reminds me of Oceans 12--remember how bad that movie was? The only reason why I watched the movie to the end was because of Brad Pitt's performance as an athletic trainer/goof ball. (Sorry, I couldn't think of any other wording to describe him.) Unfortunately, the movie was about nothing except for paranoid, cheating spouses--that's it--sorry to ruin the movie for you. Anyway, unless you have a lot of time and money to waste, rent/buy something else."
1,"Should be ""Burn Before Watching""","""Burn After Reading"" should have more accurately been called ""Burn before Watching"" to save us all two hours of our lives that we can never recover. The story is bascially non-existent, the actors (even the normally talented ones) somehow manage to universally give the worst performances of their careers, particularly Brad Pitt. If this had been his first movie, he would never have had the opportunity to make a second one. He was that bad. In fact, this tops even his horrible goofball overacting in ""12 Monkeys"". This character was similar to that one in that he played basically a male ""dumb blond"", which he did with so subtlety at all. It was a disastrously bad job.The movie is so bad that in the very last scene, two actors essentially comment on how stupid the story was. In effect, this is the filmmakers apologizing for releasing a substandard, hacked-together disaster. They must have been ashamed of it, hence the final scene."
1,Burn After Watching!,You'll wanna burn this movie after watching it. When it was in theaters I thought it looked pretty decent. Paying 5 dollars for a ticket couldn't hurt right? WRONG. The movie was so stupid! Let's just say the best character in the film they killed off anyway so it only went down hill from there. After the chair.. I forget what he called it but ugh so stupid and I walked out of the theater before it was over. Not to mention FIRST time I walked out of a theater. Do yourself a favor and DON'T watch this movie you'll definently be thankful you didn't watch it!
1,Burn Instead of Watching,"I don't normally publish reveiws for movies but this was so bad everyone deserves a warning. A better title for this movie would be, ""Burn Instead of Watching"". It was terrible. I mean really bad. I haven't seen a movie this bad in a LONG time. I have no idea how they got good actors to be in it.If you liked the TV commercials for it then don't watch the movie, talk about creative editing. The trailer was funny, upbeat and had action. This movie was boring, had gratuitous swearing and little story. Brad Pitt and George Clooney did a great job of acting out characters far from their norm. In summary, almost everyone is having an affair within a close circle and they end up dead. It really isn't funny, exciting or involving.I have friends and family that gave up before finishing but I stuck it out to the long end because I figured it had to get better and funny. I was wrong, I should have quit and the earlier the better."
1,Horrible,"I watched it and it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Better than ""Blast"", but barely. It was supposed to be a comedy, I chuckled maybe once. I would like a refund on my time."
2,Ladykillers II,"If you liked Ladykillers, you'll like this film. The general arc of the plot is similar enough to make me wonder why the Coen brothers even bothered. The acting is excellent, and the movie is quite amusing right up until the moment--SPOILER ALERT--Brad Pitt's brains splatter against the back of the closet. After that, it's hard to find much to enjoy in this picture. A disappointment, all the more so for having started well."
5,Very humorous,"This lighthearted comedy is full of quirky characters, and a couple dead bodies. Brad Pitt plays a different role than we're used to seeing him in as the silly, airhead gym employee who thinks he's stumbled upon a way for him and a female co-worker to collect a 'reward'. Unfortunately, the owner of a missing c.d. sees the two as a threat and responds violently to any hint of blackmail. All the characters have their own flaws and struggles, which makes them very realistic. A great comedy with many favorite actors.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,So-So,"I have been a Coen Bro's fan for 20+ years and I love how they don't repeat themselves but are able to maintain a recognizable style. So while this movie has some classic Coen flavors it ultimately tastes bland from attempted commercialism. It was never comedically complicated enough to be on the outside like Raising Arizona and never bloody and sadistic enough to be as compelling as No Country for Old Men (though it obviously borrows from No Country for an ""ending""). So I found it funny but forgettable. Sorry guys... I still love Barton Fink though."
4,Great movie,"This movie is funny, intelligent, and witty. It is definitely not a normal Hollywood comedy and is truly a unique movie. Highly recommended."
2,Coen the Wrong Way,"I am a fan of the brothers Coen. For me, their past efforts have ranged from like to love. This one falls far short. Throughout the film, it seemed to follow the patten of Crash(non-Cronenberg 2004). Unlike Crash, it never came together, it just crashed. Nothing is resolved. It just ends. If it weren't for the credits, I would expect another reel.Burn After Reading gets a second star for a rarefied tidbits of amusing dialog, many involving George Clooney. All the characters had their moments, but overall, this film left me feeling emptier than a big bowl of bok choy. Maybe I was expecting too much from the Coens."
3,Burn after reading,"The story is good, as is the acting, but I was disappointed with the gratuitous swearing all through it."
2,Quite funny but what was the point of the movie?,I think it was funny (though these days Hollywood thinks the more they curse in a movie the more funny it can get) but the whole point of the movie is lost on me. What did they mean by producing this film? That CIA is a sad dysfunctional place? Well I don't know but I think it was a funny movie with all cliches present. 2 out 5 is enough.
2,Coens Miss the Mark,"The Coen brothers missed the mark with this one. It has some funny moments but it just isn't that good. Malkovich and Clooney steal the movie but McDormat and Pitt pretty much just stink. It doesn't have the quirky side characters that really make the other Coen movies colorful. I am a huge fan of their work but this movie just misses the mark. See Fargo, Big Lebowski, Barton Fink, or No Country for Old Men instead. Heck Intolerable Cruelty was better."
4,Done Great,I didn't think it was as funny as Big Lebowski but its pretty freaking smart. The Coens are brillant and I'll see anything they do because their such great flimmakers.
2,More like Burn Before Watching,Was totally disappointed with this movie. Brad Pitt was funny at times but other than that a complete waste of time.
3,Almost brilliant,"When you have such brilliant directors sometimes the source material can lead to a let down, such is the case with Burn After Reading. Unlike No Country For Old Men, ""Burn Before Reading"" simply doesn't measure up to what the Coen brothers are capable of which is unfortunate because the acting in this movie is superb. From Pitt's best role since 12 Monkeys and Malkovitch's since almost well, maybe ever, the movie could have been something great.In the story the violence is supposed to be ironic and comical but is treated with such a heavy hand by the Coen's to the point that the movie lurches to a conclusion. It's unfortunate that they didn't learn how much violence off screen can be just as effective from 'Old Men'. It's a hard line to tread with any 'dark comedy' and I think the failure is probably equal parts story and direction.Which isn't to say the movie isn't worth watching, just don't expect the brilliance of Fargo."
2,Disappointed!,"Wow....all that talent and nothing to show for it. Brad Pitt's performance (what there is of it) was the only thing remotely funny in the whole movie. It takes a while for him to even be a part of the story. The other roles just were blah. Malkovich did nothing but scream and cuss, Clooney, ugh the beard was hideous and his character didn't work for the story, or lack of story, and the story line with the Russians was just plain stupid.I only paid $1.50 for this to rent. I wasted my money. No wonder this came out so fast to DVD...it tanked in the theater!"
1,movie,Very disappointed. With all the great stars this movie was neither entertaining or funny. John Malkovich was terrible and has a very ugly vocabulary. Too much use of the 'F' word.
1,SECOND WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"Not knowing much background information about this movie, we watched it last night and it was the SECOND WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN - second only to ""No Country for Old Men"", which I now know was made by the SAME morons!!! I only wish I could have given it less than one star on this rating system! Let's see - it was another movie with a bunch of LOSER characters, with a plot that went absolutely NOWHERE, and no real ending to speak of - absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!! I have now wasted over 4 hours of my life watching movies by these awful filmmakers, and I won't make that mistake again. Don't waste your time - this film is one of the WORST ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The Coens do Comedy,"When the CIA spy Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) got fired for alcoholism, he lost more than his job. He also lost a CD with sensitive information that fell into the hands of Chad (Brad Pitt), a gum-smacking, fist-pumping fitness trainer at Hardbodies, and his colleague Linda Litzke, who's a serial internet dater with dreams of extensive cosmetic surgery. This dimwitted duo concocts a plan to sell Osborne's CD to the Russians to pay for Linda's surgery. Cox is also losing his wife, Katie, who is having an affair with Harry (George Clooney), a federal marshal who's a sex addict. Unintended consequences are the result for everyone in this clever comedy from director-writers Ethan and Joel Coen (No Country for Old Men). It was refreshing to see Pitt and Clooney cast in roles far outside their types, and to watch the Coens satire politics, sex, body image, addictions, and the longing for love."

4,Offbeat in a good way,"The Bottom Line:Burn After Reading is certainly not going to be mentioned when the Coens are given Lifetime Achievement awards, but it's an amusingly quirky black comedy with a sublime performance by John Malkovich and good supporting turns by Pitt, McDormand and Clooney; the movie isn't great, but it offers a fun 90 minutes with a couple big surprises and is well worth your time.3/4"
3,"Funny with vibrant characters, but not my fave Cohen Bros.","I saw the DVD recently and wasn't sure what to expect. Like all Cohen brother films this effort had unique, vibrant characters, an unusual, complex but accessible plot and lots of laughs usually at the expense of the main characters. However, I felt that there were some loose strings and the transition between several scenes seemed to be to abrupt, as if a transitory scene were missing. My group thought that a drinking game could be developed around a certain expletive phrase that the brilliant John Malkovich says frequently. It was certainly worth renting, but not sure it is the best effort from the Cohen brothers."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"Considering the people that were in this, I really expected more. It wasn't that funny. I think it was Brad Pitt's worst role. Maybe George Clooney's too. They just weren't funny."
4,Funny film,"This is a quirky funny flick about the CIA and it should be no surprise that it came from the Coen brothers. Brad Pitt is fine as an air head and John Malkovich and George Clooney are great as usual. If you like the other Coen brothers films, as I do, you will enjoy this one."
2,"Okay, but not worth 5 stars","If you like ""dark comedy"", such as Very Bad Things and Head Above Water, you'll like this movie. I watched it because it had Brad Pitt in it. It's a story about two dummies (Francis Dormand and Pitt) who work in a gym and come across a computer disk and think it's a top secret CIA script. Anyway, see the movie. It has its hilarious parts. Like any dark comedy, everyone but Dormand in the end either winds up dead or in a nuthouse. I personally do not like Clooney. Malkovich was excellent in this film and of course, I watched it because of Dormand and Pitt. Pitt does comedy in this and is pretty good at it. Dormand is good in any movie she does. It starts out slow so one has to have some patience in the beginning. All in all, I'd watch it again, just for Dormand and Pitt."
5,"Hillarious, especially if you've lived in DC","This movie had me belly laughing. The acting is great and the storyline has DC beaurocratic life and egos down pat. My favorite characters were the ""gym"" rats though, they had me rolling in laughter because I could totally see them working at many gyms I've gone to. Best movie I've seen in a long long time."
4,Fun Movie!,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie but I thought it was hilarious. It was fun to see Brad Pitt playing such a goofy character, George Clooney and Francis M. were awesome. And John M. cracked me up every time he was in a scene using the ""F"" word.This movie is for people who like black/quirky comedies."
2,MOVIE BURN AFTER READING...,"MOVIE WAS OK, NOTHING GREAT ABOUT IT. ALMOST BORING. BRAD PITT MUST BE HURTING TO DO THIS FLICK. STUPID ENDING AND PLOT. WASTE OF MONEY."
2,I can't believe I took the time to watch this movie...,I really wish I would have gone for a run instead. The movie moved incredibly slowly and I felt like I kept just waiting for it to start. I was expecting a comedic spy movie so I was expecting something like Beverly Hills Cop.. How wrong I was...
3,I was disappointed.,"The Coen brothers' movies are either brilliant (like FARGO) or incomprehensible gibberish (like THE BIG LEBOWSKI). This was neither. This was just about a bunch of unpleasant people having a bad day. There was no one to root for. It did have a few funny moments, courtesy of Brad Pitt, but all in all I do not recommend it."
