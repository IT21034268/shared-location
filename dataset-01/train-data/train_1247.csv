3,Guess you get what you pay for...,"Quality is not as good as name brand lincoln logs, but a lot cheaper. Items came in plastic bags with no permanent box to keep them in. One kit was missing a piece and the other kit had a damaged piece. You get what you pay for! Buy cheap items from China and you will not get good quality."
3,Somewhat Silly,"This really is a good way to learn a little bit of history. And it is a good novel. But other than the Title's assertion, this is not necessarily good history. But it really is quite entertaining."
5,Think of it as actually being there...,"... i really like how this live album sounds, between the up close sound qaulity and the band members profanity plaged witty banter, it's like having S.O.D. in your living room. The live album is basically SPEAK ENGLISH OR DIE (well most of it) played live with tons of extra stuff thrown in, even if you already own SEOD,i would still get this, it's a wonderful addition. My favorite part is when Billy Milano introduces the song ""F*ck the MiddleEast"", on of my favorite S.O.D. songs of all time, despite it's short length. it's Thrashtacular."
3,Tongue in cheek listening!,"To enjoy this cd, you have to get past the prejudice title! The best song on this cd by far is the intro, March of the SOD, which is followed by the equally cool Sargent D is coming. I don't care much for the :03 type songs, but it is easy to see how Scott Ian and Anthrax evolved from this band."
1,I bought this thinking it was the original recordings.,"Another band revisites their hits for what purpose? I loved the originals, but these are sad substitutes. This one went straight to the trash can. They should have spent the time recording some new material instead of regurgitating this stuff."
3,Atlanta Rhythm Section Greatest Hits (BCI-Eclipse),"The main reason I bought this was because of the price. I wasn't enough of a fan that I ever bought one of their albums so I can't make the comparison that other reviewers have made. I found this version to be worth the price so there's nothing negative there. The version of ""Spooky"" blows me away which is one reason why I bought this. The only thing negative I can say about this disc is that the volume level is very low here; I have to crank up the volume considerably to equal the volume level of other discs. This isn't a dad disc for the price."
1,Atlanta Rhythm section - greatest hits,not original - I thought this music would be original songs by the band - very disappointing - I would prefer to exchange it for an authentic recording!
1,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this download. Buy the real bands album. I feel so cheated wasting my money on a cover band that might sound alright after about six hours of Jim Beam. My problem is I don't drink anymore. I'm about to erase this trash, and I don't know if I can even buy downloads here anymore. Why nothing was said about this not being the real ARS is beyond me. Guess I'll see what eMusic or iTunes has. Don't waste your money on this trash though. It's kind of sad."
1,music sounds all wrong,"this is so not the original music, the singer sounds nothing like the original, and the guitar playing is not quite right. If I had known how it was going to sound I would not have bought it."
1,extremely disappointed,I should have read the reviews before buying this cd. The strong vocal aspect of A.R.S. is completely missing. There are no background vocals to speak of. This cd reminds me of a kareoke recording. I'm glad I spent the little money I did because I will not listen to it. Next time I will read the reviews.
2,I skipped two-third of the book,"I am not sure if I am qualified to make an evaluation for having read only 1/3 of the book, but I just didn't have any more desire to continue. So far, I have this Lord Dare kept hanging after this young miss, and she was constantly annoyed by his reputation so there was a lot of bickerings going on; at the same time she was totally lenient with her brother who was beginning to experiencing the drinking and gambling life. Miss Farington started out as a spirited and independent young lady, but I have not read anything more that would demostrate her household management skills, and I did not intend to spend any more time to find out about the mystery of the Scotish Regalia either. But I did cheat--I peeked the ending."
5,Great product - and goes a long way,I love this product. Helped refresh my linens that had been stored and were a little 'stale' smelling. A little goes a long way. Really it takes only a capful in the rinse to make a great big difference.
4,Sharp Blades,I was unable to find the Tracer FX blades locally and ordered online. They arrived qickly and I would buy them online again.
4,Dan,I really like the Schick Tracer FX razor. Too bad it's been discontinued. I'll keep using it as long as I can get blades for it. Thanks Amazon.com!
5,Great razors!,These are great blades! Gives you a nice clean shave and very smooth skin! Good for men & women too! :O)
5,Schick Tracer FX,My boyfriend can't seem to find these blades at the local pharmacies. He likes them because he gets a really close shave. Good thing I was able to find them on Amazon.
4,Maurie's Tracer Review,These Tracer blades and shaver are not sold anymore. But one can still buy the razor blades. This shaver was good in it's time and for the people who still have the Tracer razors and continue to use it buy buying the blades >> the close shave is amazing.
4,Schick Tracer FX,"Best place to buy your Tracer FX. Use these blades for years, hard to find in stores. The big thing now is 5 or more blades, well Trace RX with 2 blades is fine for me. Glad to have found this supplyer. Order came in time as promised, good service!"
3,good satisfying shave,"I really like the shick tracer fx. It gives me a smooth comfortable shave, I can actually shave quickly with it with hardly any nick or cuts Either! I am glad I can get it online because it is not sold in my supermarket and drug stores anymore! I always try to stock up on this item because I dont know how much longer this product will be made.It's hard to find anywhere, so I am glad I can go online and still buy them.hopefully this tracer razor and blades will be around for awhile longer though because I really enjoy the close shave it gives me. I am really satisfied with this product!"
2,"Good in their Day, but...",The blades on these cartridges were very good in their day. These cartridge blades aren't nearly as sharp as they should be. I suspect they were manufactured long ago and have dulled over time. They are still usable. Doesn't seem to be the kind of product that ages well. Or maybe I just got a bad batch.
3,tracer fx,blades not shave as close as would like. Thought would be getting a better shave but am using another product for closer shave
3,This was an okay book,"I think this book was alright,but it didn`t say enough.I like any book with Rudolph Valentino,because I like to look at the pictures of him.I was always a big fan of him and his movies.What women isn`t a fan of his.He has been a sex-symbol for the past 8 decades.This book didn`t tell enough about his marriages to Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova.I know they were both lesbians and didn`t love him or any other man.This book them Natacha Rambova look like a descent person.When she was very evil that i read in other books.Thid book is okay in some way,but I would reccomend a lot of other ones."
4,Fascinating but cheaply made book,"Not to be confused by Reel Terror, a book containing the stories that influenced several sc-fi and horror movies. This book focuses on the tragic real life events surrounding some recognizable movies.Be warned, the book is cheaply made and is 8.5 x 11, not a standard paperback size as I was expecting. For the price, I would recommend trying to find it at your local library over purchasing. But a good read, nonetheless."
5,the moon's silver cradle,The title song of this lullaby collection is quite the most beautiful lullaby I have ever heard.
4,Good time songs,OK all the reviews are pretty right on... but actually Gary Lewis can't really sing too good but the songs are great and nostalgic. He can still play the drums! The end with his Dad is great. His outfit however is ridiculous and with a better one would have made it better. Its the same as the Association DVD and their lounge act outfits. Anyway its worth listening to and seeing. His interview between songs is great.
5,Wow! Can't believe they packed all this into one book!,"A terrific intergration of TCP/IP with Linux. There is tons of Linux code, and the book does a great job of walking through the TCP/IP protocol. If you are considering Linux, you can do no better than to start with this book."
2,Networking Concepts + Kernel Source Code Printout,"My opinion is this book is pretty much just some relatively high level networking concepts and a printout of a bunch of the Linux kernel source code.I guess some value add is supposed to be in giving some idea of which code fragments in the kernel source files do what, but I do not think it does a very good job of that, since it does not start with a top-down description of what needs to be done and then proceed towards more detailed views, finally ending up with annotated source code. It pretty much just gives the top level, and page after page of printouts of Linux kernel source.For me, this adds very little value, so the book is worth very little to me. At the very least I think anyone considering buying the book should take a look at it before spending money."
1,Dont buy this book - view the KERNEL Source code,90% of the book is kernel Source Code without almost no explanation. Why buy this book if you can view the source code for free
1,Yuck!,This book was basically the linux source code without the benefits of lxr.linux.no. The book is full of code examples without any explanations. The index is lame and does not include many key terms .
1,Another Disappointment,"Like most other readers of this book I'm very disappointed. With such prominent authors I was expecting more than a rehash of O/S and IPC concepts with generous reprints of un-annotated source code. Yes, I can read C code and they did say the book was for those well versed in reading C. However, if I wanted to take the time to read and understand the source code myself then I wouldn't have bothered spending $70. The book does at least give a good idea of exactly which pieces of code do what. However, this book is a far cry from Richard Stevens' books (My Hero !, R.I.P.)At most I would feel comfortable with paying $20 for this book for reference purposes and because of the nice hardback binding.Overall, the book is pretty pathetic and the authors should be embarrassed to have ther names associated with it. There is still room for a GOOD book about the TCP/IP implementation on Linux."
3,truth in advertising - i'm an author...,"The book cotnains about 1/3 text, 2/3 code.The book is not meant to be a replacement for, or evencompetitor of the amazing Stevens books - we are simply not worthy or able to do that. nor do we need to - luckily for theinternet community, Rich already did.The book attempts to show where the protocol code glues tothe OS (something radically different in linux than bsd) and tocover in more depth topics that are novel (e.g. forwarding treatment), rather than internet protocol topics that are well done elsewhere (e.g. TCP/UDP)The code included was broken down into readable chunks and soem attempt to organise this into topics. Of course, linux is fast moving (2.5 wil be out real soon now) though luckily, much of the networking code was in place in the 2.4 and is less quick to change now ...we intend to update and expand the text via the web, and a new edition, as we see 2.5 come out - we hope."
4,shows the hidden underbelly of America,"I thought it was interesting how the movie seemed to show how, while ""proper"" America was trying to look like we have it all together, there is chaos and disintegration going on everywhere; I thought an especially telling scene for that depiction was when Rose was trying to run away, and the stepdad was sitting with his gun looking ready to break down, while proper, respectable-looking people were in the house, playing the piano and singing.I told my husband that I could swear that the narrator was Christine Lahti; I finally found that that was true on the Internet Movie Database site; it was listed on her movie credits as an uncredited narrator for the movie Desert Bloom."
2,Most error-filled WWI book I've ever read,"I've accumulated quite a library of WWI aviation books, and this is undoubtedly the most error-filled I've ever come across. The Red Baron's death ocurring in an Albatross? Triplanes with prop spinners? Twin Lewis guns in a Sopwith Camel? Mislabeled/misidentified aircraft too numerous to mention. I'll give the author good marks for conveying the ""feel"" of what an airman's life was like and how the war wore them down, but it was just impossible to get past the glaring factual errors. Any of the new info I gleaned was impossible to take at face value since he obviously got so much of the basic stuff wrong. Oh, yeah, a large portion of the photos are either of plastic models or the box art from old Revell model kits. At least it was inexpensive..."
3,"the canvas falcons, the men and planes of WW1","As a non history buff (but an aircraft buff, pilot and antique aircraft builder and flier), I enjoyed this book about fliers and planes of WW1. It is about the gut feelings of those who flew and died in the beginnings of combat aircraft. An insight of those who had guts that sometimes got disturbed by events around them."
1,A very poor book!,"There is very little fact in Mr Longstreet's book, ""The Canvas Falcon"". To begin with the Aircraft of World War 1 were covered with either linen or plywood, none were covered with canvas. Mr Longstreet's hatred of Germans and especially of Manfred von Richtofen clouds the book with more fiction than fact. While the book is easy for all to read, it should not be considered a history book. There are many other books on World War 1 aviation which are much better. As a World War 1 historian I have read many books on the subject and I would have to rank ""The Canvas Falcons"" at the bottom of the list.Richard D. Schrader"
3,What I Mean - Modjo,"UK Maxi Single Track Listing for -""WHAT I MEAN"" - MODJO1) Original - 4:102) The Crayon Aloud's Remix - 6:183) Mood II Swing Vocal Club Mix - 7:12also includes the video.2001"
3,A Tale of Two Halves,'Ring..' can essentially be divided into two halves. The first 300+ pages is filled with musings and arguments over the gender of a character and reflections on the events of book two. Very slow moving. The second half jumps into the flow of the story and is much easier to read.I haven't yet read the previous two books in the series (though I plan to) so it took me over 100 pages to begin to understand anything in this book. I can't stress this highly enough. Start with the first book.This is exceptionally well-written and is an original take on the normally staid field of epic fantasy. A very refreshing read. Fancher spends a lot of time developing her characters so that by the end I felt well acquainted with each of them. I look forward to a fourth book.
2,Very Disapointing,"Although this is not the worst book I have ever read, I found it very disapointing. The first two books were wonderful, they presented a beleivable set of brothers living in an interesting world, but I could not get past the first couple hundred pages of this book because it was so bad.The focus on Mikhyel didn't bother me until it came to all that Temorii/Thyerri ( ). When it came to that point, I tried to press on, hoping that the story would be salvaged by the end , but i found i couldn't handle it any more. I closed that book and have never opened it."
2,"Talk, talk, talk....is this Asimov come back to life?","No, I take that back - Asimov's discussions at least deal with interesting subject matter. This book doesn't even do that; all it has to offer is page after page of small talk - and if you go to lots of parties or other social gatherings you know how boring that gets.Which is really a pity, because the first two books in Fancher's series were quite intriguing. But in this, the third book, the bottom just drops out of the story. In fact, there is no story.There's supposed to be a fourth book, and I might buy that to see if Fancher can come back from this debacle."
5,Wonderfully original,"Jane Fancher's ""Ring of Destiny"" (as well as its two predecessors, ""Ring of Lightning"" and ""Ring of Intrigue"") is great reading - she (Jane Fancher) has created a fascinating world peopled with complex characters and a marvelous blend of magic and technology. The world of Rhomatum will delight SF lovers."
2,A dissapointment and not the great conclusion I'd hoped for.,"I was looking forward to a conclustion of this series with this book. My heart sank when I saw how thick the book was and when I then saw there was a 4th book coming...Then I started reading the book. With this installment the author seems to have lost her sense of balance with story telling. Most of this book (3/4) seems to be about Mikhyel and his tangled relationships. In the end I gave up on this book. I got sick of reading about the great Mikheyl, because what I actually enjoyed about the first 2 books was the sense of balance and growth of all the three brothers Mikheyl, Deymoran and Nikki.I won't be reading any more of this series. It's been a real dissapointment because it started out so well and now it's just rambling. What ever happended to a well written TRILOGY?? It's a rare beast these days."
1,Very Ordinary,"I wanted to like this band and album...we live in the same town. However, I found the album to be very generic. The vocals were very uninspired and strained. With all the comparisons to Third Eye Blind (which is very misguided, I might add) I'd rather listen to Third Eye Blind's first album than this.With every new band sounding like this, it's going to be hard for bands of this style to stand out. These guys are just another generic face in the crowd."
4,Buy This.....,"I purchased this at a local Christian bookstore.I would like to hear the name Jesus,or the title Lord once in a while.But, These guys are Great!!!From the first track my feet start to kick and my hands start tapping.As with any album there are a couple of songs that I skip, but you can't please everyone all the time.It's definately worth the money.I love it so I recommend that you buy it too. Now!"
4,"Good Guide, but could give some more specific information","This is a good guide to where to find trails but lacks enough information about difficulty and length of travel. I read a copy which I bough a while back at a gas station, and it is worth while to have since it has some trails which are not covered in anyother guide."
1,Not Impressed at all.,"I found it to be rather vague and hard to read, it was not at all comprehensive."
2,Useless for Southwest Colorado,"Not a very helpful book. The book I should have bought: Colorado Trails Southwest Region by Peter Massey; Jeanne Massey and Angela Titus (Paperback - May 31, 2007)"
2,Covers some topics - not all,"If you are looking for 2 or 3 good points, the book is good. The rest could be explained in book much better."
3,a few gems,"This book is simply written for anyone to read. The book clarified some communication blunders I have made in the past without realizing it or others have made with me. While I found the book helpful, but still feel there are probably better books out there."
2,Simplistic schoolgirl communication skills,"I had recently read several other persuasion books so when I read this one, I was very dissapointed in comparison. It seemed to be very superficial and was geared to day to day politically correct communication."
3,Not intended for larger rim sizes,"I bought these wheel felts and the wheel covers to store my summer wheels without fear of them scratching each other on my wheel rack. I would give these 5 stars for rims 19"" or smaller. Anything 20"" and above beware. The exact diameter of these felts is 20"", and they don't do the best job of aligning themselves to the center. On my 20"" rims I can pretty much see the lip of the wheel all the way around between the wheel cover and the felts. My application is 295/45r20 and 265/50r20 tires so consider this when combining wheel felts with wheel covers. This works out to about a 30.5"" height and 11"" width. Any tire smaller would do better, but any tire larger means more exposed rim.Great product, but minus 2 stars because they don't make them in a larger size for larger rims. I think I would have been completely happy with a 24""-28"" diameter wheel felt."
3,"Fine sound, with flaws","The sound on this device is of good quality, but the speakers don't project as omni-directionally as they should. My main objection to this machine is that it doesn't do ANYTHING unless the iPod is docked in it--no radio, even.But given that the comparable machines that do what this does are around $500, it is a good, but flawed, product."
4,Wow! This is Amazing,"Wow! This unit is Amazing! Easy to operate and the sound quality is clear without any extra sound when using the ipod. The FM radio comes across well, you may have to fiddle with the atenae a bit. But works really good."
1,Broke within 3 uses!,"I wanted a fairly portable ipod speaker system that had FM radio--this fit the bill. The sound was ok, not fantastic, but the main problem was you can only control the thing with the remote control. My remote broke after using it just 3 times. I didn't drop it, I wasn't rough with it. It just broke. Now there is no way to turn on the speaker system. I do not recommend this product."
1,I cannnot believe I paid $85.40 for this!,I ordered this speaker new. I was sent a used one that was covered in dirt and FOOD. It was also missing the power cord so it couldn't even be used. The instructions manual was missing as well. I would advise everyone against purchasing this speaker from Galactics.
1,Not for me!,"I used the unit to listen to iPod and MP3 players. The sound was OK at first but soon became weaker. Then, the iPod docking station wouldn't make a power connection. Finally even the MP3 players started to sound like they were ""stuttering."" I tossed it in the garbage rather than go through the process of getting it repaired or replaced with the same unit. I purchased a couple of other Speaker Docs. to replace this.Cannot recommend based on my experience."
4,A Waitress of Fire,"One thing about B. Hillman--her ""open"" poetry doesn't seem as calculated and easy as many other poets. It seems that she arrives upon the difficulty of her poems honestly--i.e., this is the only way I can articulate this, as opposed to: I could say this much easier, but then I wouldn't be hip. ""Nipples"" is a great poem. I love how Hillman can raise the everyday (Lean Cuisine) to the sublime. If you're interested in the more experimental bends of contemporary poetry, this would be a good volume--a subtext is still apparent beneath the fractured surface. This is more modern than post-modern: a good thing."
4,Good Quality Book,"I used this book in my training as an abstrator a number of years ago. At the time it was considered one of the best if not the only guide to real estate abstracting. I still recommend it's use to beginning abstractors today. It may seem over simplified, but it's simplicity is what makes it easy to understand and use as a training tool."
4,Better Ware,"David S. Ware's ""Third Ear Recitation"" on DIW (a Japanese arm of Sony/Columbia) is a better effort than his early material for the Silkheart label. The band has definitely forged a distinctive (and loud) sound that relies heavily on group improvisation. However, in some ways this album is a disappointment. After the soaring ""Flight of i,"" I was hoping to find even more blending of musical, spiritual introspection and soaring, exploratory avant-garde flights. But instead of his wonderful original compositions, Ware has instead settled for standards like ""Autumn Leaves"" and Sonny Rollins' ""East Broadway Run Down."" While it is interesting to hear Ware tackle these tunes, this is not the best vehicle for his playing. ""Third Ear's"" successor ""Earthquation"" covers similar ground, but once Ware switches over to the Homestead label, the music really starts to take off and expand."
5,A Gift to Delight,"Written by Maya Angelou as a personal and touching Mother's Day salute, this tiny volume of poetry will truly make every day Mother's Day for any woman who reads it, be she a mother or a daughter. In a mere ten pages of text, the author traces and illuminates the complex mother/daughter relationship from conception (""I was created in you...you were created for me"") through clinging, fretful babyhood, the turbulent teen years and adult understanding.My favorite lines:You were alwaysThe heart of happiness to me,Bringing nougats of glee,Sweets of open laughter.Angelou's little book is a gift to delight.by Patricia Nordyke Pandofor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"
3,maternal thoughts from maya,"I checked out this book from our public library because I was intrigued by the notion of a tiny ""book"" the entire content of which is one, short poem by one of our country's most famous writers. In addition to her autobiographical works, Maya Angelou has published five volumes of poetry, and has read her work (""On the Pulse of Morning"") at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. There is no foreword, preface, afterword, bibliography, or any explanatory notes to ""Mother,"" just the brief poem itself. If you did not stop to ponder and meditate, you could read the poem in five minutes. But that would be a shame. Angelou's poem evokes the grace and power of our mothers, and our experience of them beginning as babies, then proceeding through childhood, teenage rebellion, and then adulthood. My mother died a year ago and Angelou's poetry renewed my gratitude and admiration for her."
3,Maya Angelou,I was under the impression that this book from the description was an anthology with another author having a story in it
1,Not up to par,"I am a huge fan of Maya Angelou and believe I have just about everything she has written on my book shelf. However, I felt let know and saddened when I read this poem. Perhaps it was my error in not realizing what I was buying - I thought it was a book about motherhood. I hope the next purchase I make of this amazing woman will fill my heart as her previous writing has done."
5,Great for kids (and grown-ups too)...,"If you want to give your child an omega-3 supplement this is the BY FAR the best product I have found. By son rebelled against everything I tried (and he is not the rebellious type) until I ordered this. There is no fish taste whatsoever, just a light lemon flavor, and the serving is small. I mix it into a couple of tablespoons of strawberry yogurt and he is fine with it (he knows it's in there). He's even considering taking it straight off the spoon. My husband recently switched to it as well--in his own words, ""this stuff is good--much better than taking all those pills)..."
5,Very Finest Fish Oil,"I am thrilled with the product...it seems to be helping my son to focus and attend to some tasks better. He's only been taking it for about 2 weeks, so I expect it will continue to improve.My only criticism is that it took a long time to get because it was backordered, so I'll need to be sure to order the next supply a month before I need it."
4,I think it smells fishy,"My son won't eat it, but I mix it in with juice and then he'll take it. Hope it will help prevent a few colds down the road."
2,Needs work on the Taste,"I was so hoping the taste of this would be passable for my grandson, but it wasn't. He would not take another sip of it after the first time. I even tried hiding it in another drink, but he took one drink and knew there was something in it. He poured it out. Won't be buying this or any other flavored fish oil again."
2,Nothing new here.,"It's amazing that MOD is synnonomous with SOD because it seems no matter how many times their formula for songwriting hits your ears, nothing new is offered to the consumer. I know bands shouldn't stray too far from their roots but, this tree refuses to grow. If you're looking for something new from MOD this time around, don't waste your time. The sole reason I wanted to hear this album was because of a review stating that this album actually stood up to SOD. What a mistake."
4,sounds like old MOD to me!,"this cd is solid musicialy and lyrically start to finish not a few good songs and filler for the rest of the cd like devolution,red white and screawed and rebal you love to hate,those cds are not solid in my eyes half the song are filler if not more.USA for MOD&gross misconduct are tHe real deal in my book and rtythm of fear is ok but missed the mark some for me but descent but not legendary by far & surfin MOD is fun&funny buy not serious enough to count for much realy.dictated aggression is a return to form and the first serious effort i'd say in years that counts worth the money and you should get!"
5,So many uses,"This is a great gloss gives your lips a wonderful shine without being greasy.I also love that it comes in a variety of colors. So you can were it alone, without or without makeup and still add a little color to your look without full make up. Also it's great to add over my favorite lipstick! Also I use a little on my cheeks for color when I don't have other makeup with me.Revlon keep making great products please because so far I am a happy camper with your make up line."
1,Extremely Difficult to Use,"I was so disappointed with this item. It is supposed to curl and straighten. However, it was extremely difficult to use for curls : you have to hold a section of hair out with one hand, turn the iron half-way,wrap the section of hair around the iron, turn the iron half-way again, while you continue to hold the remaining portion of the section of hair with your other hand. Very hard to maneuver for the front of your head, absolutely impossible for the hair on the back of your head. Instead of curls, I ended up with crimps and bends. This iron should only be used by professionals on their clients. I would never recommend it for individual use. Considering the high price ($160.00), this was truly a waste of money. Luckily, I was able to return it to the vender for a refund."
1,Horrible,"I bought this straightener because I liked the fact that it had curved plates and I thought it would make my ends smooth and curled under. I was so excited about trying it, but it took me so long because you have to take tiny pieces to straighten. It didnt even straighten the small sections, it was so awful. I have pretty thin hair too. Definitly not worth 160 dollars. I just ordered a CHI and hope to get better results. Dont bother with this! Im returning it to the Seller thank god!"
1,Waste of Money & Time,"This is the worst ""hair iron"" I've ever used. I originally bought it based on magazine descriptions/articles, especially the one about this hair iron being used on Jennifer Aniston's hair, by her hairstylist, and a picture of her great hair next to the product. I used it and no curls waves or even correct flattening. AND I do know how to use hair irons. This is the most amped-up talked about hair brand of hooey. One of my degrees is Marketing, and all I can say is these people did a pretty good job of making a big deal about nothing in the hair world. These products can also be bought at Sephora--which speaks highly of this company. I wish I took it back, now I'm stuck with it. Do yourself a favor and get a CHI CHI Nano Technology 1 inch Ceramic Flat Iron--a real hair iron, those people don't even need to over-advertise, their product speaks for itself."
1,"In a word, Painful","This film is painfully bad. Some bad movies are so bad they're good. This one passes good and goes straight back to bad. But I did learn a few things about Sasquatch in watching this film.I learned that Sasquatch not only starred in this film, but he edited it as well. Oh, the credits don't come out and SAY that the film was edited by Sasquatch. But from the best I can tell, Sasquatch edited the film, using a blunt instrument. Maybe a tree trunk or smooth rock.I also learned that Sasquatch has X-ray vision and can dodge bullets. This leads me to believe that Sasquatch is the love child of Superman and Chewbacca. It's somthing I'd rather not think about, but the proof is right in the film.All in all, this film should be avoided at all costs. There are much better Lance Henriksen B-movie vehicles you can rent/purchase instead."
1,A Major Disappointment!!!,"Wow!! This was horrible! I thought i was watching MTV's The Real World meets Bigfoot. The plot was weak and the acting weaker. Lead actor Lance Henrikson looked absolutely dis-interested. I WAS absolutely dis-interested. Now folks it gets worse. The makeup was scary...and not in a good way. You don't have to look too hard to see good 'ol bigfoots bald skull cap. Yep our buddy Sasquatch needs rogaine in this Bigfoot installment. My advice: Check out Legend of Boggy Creek. It's good Bigfoot fun, a little cheap n' cheesy but it doesn't take itself too seriously like this waste of film!!"
2,"Dang, this is one crappy movie","i've always been intrigued with the legend of bigfoot, so i went out and bought this dvd, excited that finally they made a good film that would really capture the mystery of the legend. this is not what i had hoped for. very poor acting, subplots that were distracting, and annoying camerawork. all i can say about the monster is some things are better left unseen."
3,'The Big Hairy Truth is Still Out There',"This movie is different in the way that you're told up front that it's the recanting of a `supposedly' true story and so in that vein <I>`Sasquatch'</I> is a refreshing and grasping horror/adventure movie. An independent film, for sure, that obviously had consultants to understand the aspects, magnitude, and characteristics of the aforementioned `Bigfoot' or `Sasquatch,' the film never really lets you go, your attention firmly fixed at all times in case you miss something! Entertaining for teenagers right up to seniors, the acting is okay to good most times with average to good directing to pull off something that is obviously filmed remotely on location. Nice scenery, action, some minor nudity, and yet again some great acting scenes from Lance Henriksen bring the audience `actual' accounts as if it were a documentary of sorts. It isn't going to win any Oscars, but it won't bore you either!"
2,Disappointed!,"I rented Sasquatch and was very disappointed with the movie.The movie moved around too much, fading from one seen to another, it is edited perfect for network tv, but it frustrating to watch this on a dvd, with editing breaks all the time.I thought the cast was very good in this movie, but the script needed, more work. I have read and researched much information on the Sasquatch and I wished the script writer and director had done so too. The only part I found realistic was that the Sasquatch watched the group move about and tracked them through the bush. The Sasquatch didn't look like anything actual eye witnesses have seen. There were no vocalizations at all in this movie, this would have added an element of excitement to the movie.It could have been done better, too bad they didn't get John Green, John Bindernagle or Dean Harrison, who are experts in this field to help them with a realistic script. I wasn't looking for a documentary, but a bit more of a believable effort."
1,A Misleading Disappointment!!,"Wow!! This movie was horrible. I thought I was watching MTV's Road Rules meets Bigfoot. Lance Henrikson(lead actor)appeared totally dis-interested. I WAS totally dis-interested. Not only was the acting subpar, the makeup was amateurish. Bigfoot looked like a combination of a gorilla and the vampire Nosferatu.You don't have to look too hard to see good 'ol Sasquatch's bald skull cap. Check out Legend of Boggy Creek for good Bigfoot fun!"
1,so very awful,"If you are a bigfoot enthusiast like I am, you will be dissapointed. It's not at all factual nor does it try to be. Poor plot. Bigfoot is not agressive, as a matter of fact, they are more afraid of us then we of them. They would not attack and most certianly do not kill. Characters were very shallow.just awful....."
2,"Unscary, Bad Acting, BigFoot looks stupid, Plots bad","I think I just summed everythign up with the title. This is just a film thats not the worst you have ever seen, but dont expect it to be much, it will let you down."
1,Why was this made?,"This movie suffers from many flaws, though did you expect anymore? Characters are all very one dimensional and badly acted, though I don't think even a good actor could have spoken this dialogue and made the characters seem real. The characters do nothing to grab your attention, in no way will you feel for them as people. When they die, there is no satisfaction in seeing them die because the movie does not even succeed in that sense. If you can't get the audience to feel bad for the characters at least you can let them laugh at their deaths (like Final Destination tried to do though not a good movie either). You just don't care when you watch this movie. I can't imagine how anyone can see anything of value in this movie. Terrible plot, terrible characters, I could go on but there really is no point. I dont think anyone can consider buying, or watching this movie after simply reading the synopsis and then looking at the cover of the DVD."
2,Total snooze fest ...,"Don't judge a dvd by its cover...I thought this movie was boring. The first couple minutes of the film interested me. It jumped right into the action and I was looking forward to seeing some horror, but the horror came to a screeching halt! The story in the film advances 2 months and Enter-stalk mode! Am I the only one tired of ""stalking"" and no action? I just wasn't scared... Throughout most of the film, Bigfoot roams around the woods staring at everyone and making noises. By the time Bigfoot gets to the killings, as a viewer, I lost interest. I was just waiting for the movie to end. A boring environment, a boring cast of middle aged characters (at least they act that way), and a dull, disappointing end leads to my rating of only 2 stars..."
1,very sad turnout..,"The title of this movie should have been called ""campfire"" or ""Fireside Mystery"". The movie spends more time by the fire than focusing of footage of the actual creature. It keeps running into the same obstacles, every time--the plane goes down, the creature kills the passengers, team of billionaires venture out into the wilderness to try to find the creature, the stop and talk, dissention sparks between a few of the members, they move on, someone gets injured, etc. The obvious has already been stated about this movie-bad acting, a weak cast lead by Lance Heriksen, who doesnt even seem to try to save the movie from failing to get the point accross. I dont understand why this is even a movie---although it has some cool visual effects, but they serve more as a distraction than anything."
2,Abominable indeed,"This is one of the greates lies I've ever watched on screen. The movie is slow paced. I appreciate the fact that it was not produced to be just another gore show, but the direction is sup par, the acting is atrocious and the ending was an insult. (I will give no spoils).A total failure."
1,CANT GO LOWER THAN ONE STAR?,"WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I RENTED THIS MOVIE!!!!!STUPID, STUPID, STUPID,.....I THOUGHT WHEN I RENTED THIS MOVIE, IT WAS A REMAKE OF THE 1978 FILM SASQUATCH, THE LEGEND OF BIGFOOT!!!!! WRONG.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!! I WOULDNT BUY IT TO SAVE MY LIFE"
2,"Cute, but passed over","Once you put this together, what exactly do you do with it? My kids liked it, but forgot about it 2 days later.But you can at least use the pieces for something else. However, as Legos go, it is inexpensive[*],and makes a decent stocking stuffer.[* Apparently the price of this item went way up since I first wrote this. My review applies to a product that had cost about $5.]"
4,Harry Potter Lego,Ok I have always been a clueless Lego person but my seven year old godson and I had a blast putting this together. He loves all things Harry Potter so it made for a great gift. I think these Lego groups are awesome cause you know what it is supposed to look like when you are done. It is so much better than just getting a tub of Lego's.
2,Not his best work,"While at the time it was published, this book may have been very successful for Clarke, it is now extremely dated. Although he makes prescient remarks about the development of birth control, the novel has otherwise not stood the test of time. It was clear on every page that this novel was written many, many years ago. And even if you overlook the dated viewpoint, the human characters are cardboard. If you are looking for great classic sci-fi, choose Rendezvous with Rama instead and you won't be disappointed."
3,Childhood's End,I enjoyed the book very much until towards the end. I have read Clarke's books before and he has such a vivid imagination it is hard for me to follow his descriptions. I reread and reread the book but still am stumped by the ending.
5,Very Good,"I'm not the kind of person who really enjoys reading, but I had to read for my English class, and I really liked this book. It was a short and easy book to read, and it was very good. I don't think someone who doesn't like Sci-Fi would enjoy it, but certainly someone who neither likes Sci-Fi nor dislikes it would enjoy the book (Wow that's a long sentence). It's worth buying -- or at least checking out at the library. It's a good read."
5,Amazing! Best book ever!,"This is, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read. Arthur C. Clarke is a genius. The way it spans so many years and so many characters is awesome, and the Overlords are wicked. I won't reveal too much about this book, because if you've never read it, there are a lot of surprises along the way, and I don't want to ruin that for anyone, and that's what makes it so awesome. This book is far superior to anything ever written, including Clarke's own ""2001"". Check this out, you won't regret it. Thank you Mr. Clarke, for this brilliant masterpiece."
3,"Interesting ideas, but an unsatisfying story","Childhood's End is considered by many to be a classic. While it has some original ideas, the story itself has some flaws. Some chapters are simply a dry accounting of the changes to human society without showing the impact on the actual characters. Some characters I just found unengaging and really didn't care what happened to them.I'm sure I'll never forget the ideas in this book, but I have very little interest in reading it again."
3,Doesn't hold up,"Five years ago, I would have said that this was one of my favorite books. But I just attempted to re-read it, and really it doesn't hold up. I found myself bored with the lack of the depth. I guess I just grew out of this one."
2,Personally this is not one of my favorite books.,"I gave the book a little below average because of not comprehanding it right away. There were so many characters they were hard to keep them all seperate from each other. The time lapse was also another thing that confused me. First we the Overlords, then we meet Stromgren and Wainwright and then they die. It's like each chapter there's a whole new set of characters! I mean to me this book was too far out there. My personal opinion of Science Fiction that I don't care for it. I think if you do get into Science Fiction this would probably be a good book, because a lot of my fellow peers liked it. Personally it's a matter of whether you like Science Fiction or not. I give Arthur C. Clarke credit for the many books he wrote, but this book to me was a waste of 2 weeks. My experience with Science Fiction is also very little, but I know enough to never read this book or any other Sci-fi books again."
2,Arthur needs to get over himself,"This ""classic"" was a disappointment. First the events were too fantastic, too far fetched even for science fiction and too hard to swallow,..etc. Again and again through out the book, Arthur demonstrates that he has this British Empire superiority complex. He assumes that measures of human progress include such things as everyone on earth speaking English, that ALL religions are the same and that London is the jewel of Europe and therfore, the world. On the whole, I found the book irritating despite a clearly sophisticated writing style."
2,Weird and somewhat pointless science fiction epic,"So aliens come to Earth and impose peace and order, along with restrictions. Why are they here? Are they trying to help us? Is is good to be ruled by a foreign species? These questions are posed and then answered in the strangest and most implausible manner. Basicaly, the aliens are here because of Ms Cleo!So, what is this novel? At first I thought it was a libertarian fantasy about the dangers of authoritarianism. But it isn't that at all. Is it about man's future in space, as it sort of seems to be? Not, really...the book says that man's future is not in the stars.All in all, I can see why Clarke wants to distance himself from the views presented in this book...so why did he write it at all?"
5,Looking back,"Just received a new Kindle Fire. Wow! What Science has wrought. Have loved sci-fi as a young reader, 60 or so years ago, still into it. My kids (now 49 and under) love it too. Thought it befitting to make the first book on my KF ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke and what a disappointment! Not available as an e-book. I've read tons of books in all genres and this book still stands out in my mind for the ideas it presented. Sir Arthur wrote this early in his career and with his background as a real Scientist is deserving of being read and listened to. The metaphysical tone of many of his science fiction works are inspiring as well as mesmorizing. There have been attempts to make a movie of this work but seem to be half-hearted efforts or dropped (Spielberg too?). So here's hoping this will stimulate others to ask for this as an e-book- I'll just have to wait and start with something else I guess. So many books, so little time. Thanks guys."
4,Highly Unpredictable,"What started off as a rather traditional SF piece turned into a highly unpredictable and impossible to put down read. I have not encountered ideas explored in Childhood's End in any other books. Even considering the fact that the book was written almost 60 years ago, it reads very fresh and engaging. Definitely a must read."
5,Fabulous,"Clarke can really do little wrong in my mind. I had not read this so when it was a kindle deal, I thought why not? Little did I know I would spend the next several hours unable to put the book down. Others have mentioned the similarities to the movie Knowing. Apparently the director even makes a reference in the film. If you didn't like Knowing please don't let that put you off, this is far superior. If you did like the flick, add this to your reading list. Shoot add it either way, it's a quick read and worthy of your time."
1,"Boring beginning (you start with the UN?!), sad middle, very disturbing end","Having loved 2001 and the sequels, I was very interested to read another book by Clarke. Until around page 21, when I realized there was going to be some kind of message in the book. Authors sending me a message usually = the plot is going to suck. Long story short--this book shows us what Clarke's idea of what a great afterlife it would be without a God. Oh, and if we all give up our individuality. So some Socialist undertones to the rampant Atheism throughout. And to those who say there's no pro-Atheism, anti-religious bias in the book? Take a look at humanity's ""assistants"" through the process. Subtle Arthur, very subtle. Ditch this waste of paper, and save yourself about 3 hours of wasted reading, and 1 to 2 hours of rampant depression after finishing it--this is the most depressing thing I've ever read."
1,What an ending!,"Throughout my experience in reading Childhood's End by Arthur C Clarke life started normally on Earth and then took a dramatic turn when the Overlords came, that changed everything on Earth. As humans began to adapt to the sudden change life went back to normal.The beginning of the book started off with no real excitment and then later on the excitment began to grow. Soon the excitment began to disappear as I reached the end of the book which ruined the book because it all happened so fast. The ending was unclear and left you questioning things. I would not recommend this book because it is not one of those sci-fi books that makes you want to keep reading, and this book leaves you questioning in the end."
1,Intresting means so many things,"The word 'intresting' is often used when trying to be kind, and still give an opinion,my opinion of this book is the same. I did, in all honesty, find certain parts of the book to be fascinating and thought provoking. However, I was deeply disturbed by the author's view of society,and by the way that he thinks - the evidence being the story in the book itself. I was horrified at the ending, and repulsed by so many of the points made by the book. I found the entire read extreemly, almost intinctively disturbing."
3,"""The stars are not meant for man""??","Although a good read - I found the conclusion of Childhood's End to be quite depressing. Mankind's destiny as envisioned in this work is not what I would consider an acceptable one at all. This seems to be the type of thing that the ""gateway"" cult embraced. I must still highly recommend this book, though. Its amazing to me that this was written in 1953. Take out the ""overlords"" and you have quite an intriguing parallel to the way things have actually turned out. Despite a lack of an abundant amount of ""hard-science"" you usually find in Clarke's books, he still proves to be a master story teller and plot weaver. This is definately not the best ""science fiction"" you'll come across - but you will see how it has influenced the ""science fiction"" of today. I couldn't help thinking of the ""collective consciousness"" of the borg in Star Trek......"
5,Why I couldn't put it down,"It must have been midnight when I picked up the book to read before I went to bed. Intending only to read a few pages to settle me down for the evening. I ended up finishing it in one sitting! I just couldn't put it down. The book was so enthralling the plot unfolded so eloquently, and the mystery so intense that it would have been insane to. I was very tired the next day but it was well worth it."
4,"Excellent reading, spookily realistic.","Childhood's End is a grim tale about mankind's first contact with aliens. The plot unfold's itself towards the very end, with only brief insights into the true nature of the alien's mission on Earth. As the story unfolds, I was surprised by the many twists and turns in the plot. The ending is incredibly emotional, and Clarke brings the reader right into the story."
2,Don't waste your time,"Clarke is not a master of insight into the human soul, and ""Childhood's End"" reflects that soullessness. There is not anything here worthwhile enough to redeem this tedious paean to the New Age philosophies. If you want to read Clarke at his best, look at 2001. It's far more readable than Childhood's End, and has the added advantage of not aspiring to silly philosophies that ultimately can't be substantiated"
5,A SciFi Classic for the Young At Heart,"I recently reread Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End"" and wound up rediscovering my youthful fascination with science fiction.This is the good stuff. Clarke always told his stories with an Englishman's placid tone. You won't find much in the way of titillation in his tales unless it's the frisson one gets upon seeing an imaginative concept brilliantly executed.In ""Childhood's End"", Clarke gives us a distinctly different sort of alien invasion than the laser-and-bomb battles we're used to from decades of movies and novels. Clarke's Overlords simply hover above our cities, unapproachable and immune to harm. When the initial furor dies down, they start to execute their plan.The tale spans generations and never flags in its ability to grab and hold the reader's attention. The ending is absolutely shocking and yet fits the narrative perfectly.If you enjoy science fiction or have been looking to dip a toe in the genre's deep well, check out ""Childhood's End""."
4,"Fascinating, though not for everyone","This is one of those books you'll read voraciously, then put down and go, ""Huh?"" While revealing anything about the plot you won't read in the first few pages will give too much away, suffice it to say that Clarke's opinions about the fate of humanity may raise your eyebrow. You'll probably either love it, or wonder if you're time wasn't wasted. As I said: fascinating, though not for everyone"
4,Moving Sci-Fi work,"What seemed like an ordinary tale of aliens descending upon Earth to take over, turned into a profound work of humanities struggle, not physically, but mentally, with their interactions with their ""overlords."" Rather than looking at a stereotypical perspective of Aliens raging war with humans, Clarke creates the story of different individuals and their attempts with facing a world of monotony and routine, without individualism. Clarke exceeds the realm of sci-fi by looking at what it means to be a human. Great read."
3,the anti-Independence Day,"I like to think of this book as the anti-Independence Day. Childhood's End is a pretty typical piece of Clarke fiction -- that doesn't make it bad just that you have a pretty good idea going into it of what you're going to get. That said, I would venture to say that it's probably best served up to some mid-to-late-teens burgeoning sci-fi fans that are in need of a twist to the Asimov, Bova, and Pohl that they've likely been reading."
5,Never disapoints,The best of S/F where sience fiction has potential to become reality.Recomended fo anyone thinking of human evolution or is just C Clarke fan.
5,GREAT BOOK,Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Childhood's End is incredibly imaginative and interesting. Now I want to read all of Clarke's books.
5,Excellent novel,"Probably the best novel on the future of human race, in Clarke's vision. Excellent knowledge of human nature, imaginative and full of innovative ideas."
4,Childhood's End,"Classic Clarke sci-fi.17 more words, 14 now, I don't know how long I can ramble to get teh freakin minimum wo"
4,A window over the future?,It's a visionary novel full of promises and hopes for the human beings' future. Let's substitute the Overlords with the next-to-come maturity of our society and politicians and we will maybe have a good reason to keep fighting and dreaming to give our sons a better tomorrow.
3,*~*Shai's Book Review*~*,"Childhood's End is a compelling science fiction novel about human life being controlled by superior beings who influence humans to create what they think is a better Earth in their eyes. But how much influence is too much influence?As the story unfolds you find yourself confused at some points, but anxious to find out how the story will play out in the end. The author Arthur C. Clarke show's his imaginative intellect in this space adventure by testing your brain power. The book does drag on sometimes but can peak the readers interest at other points. I would most likely recommend this book to older more advanced readers, due to the difficult vocabulary, and confusing text."
3,I Alex Stemm read this book Childhood's End,I Alex Stemm enjoyed reading this book Childhood's end. i liked the ending i wasnt really a big surprise but it was interesting. There was no main charactor but i liked that it kept things fresh. This whole book was about change things were constantly changeing. its also about power though the book there is aways a higher power and a highest power. over all this was a good book and i suggest anyone the age 12-99 to read it right now and you will have good luck.
3,Over-rated,"I'm a fan of Arthur C. Clarke and I'd read about ""Childhood's End"" for years -- what an ingenious plot-devise it was to have the aliens look like devils. So I finally ordered a copy from Amazon. Frankly, the book is over-rated. Especially disappointing is the book's ending -- on Earth and humanity coming to an end because of the sudden ""evolution"" of homo sapiens into a new species with extraordinary paranormal powers. Readers should know that Clarke wrote ""Childhood's End"" when he was fascinated with and believed in the paranormal. He was even captured by the charlatan Uri Geller. By 1992, Clarke had become a complete skeptic."
2,This book is not so great,"The book is readable thuough the story line is pretty dull. The characters and the world clarke created are too naive, I guess that have to do with the fact that the story was written in the 50'."
2,Rather bland,A rather boring look at a Earth doomsday scenario. It's kind of vague on why things are going on. The ending is just plain weird.
4,Evolution in to the cosmos,"Arthur C. Clarke's book is short, poignant and perfectly executed. He starts with a simple premise of alien's becoming caretakers or overlords for humanity. Far from destroying humanity or contrastingly, ensuring the happiness of humanity the overlords goal is quite more complex. The overlords do work to make the lives of humans better but they also act as protectors for the solar system when humans make the next leap in evolution, beyond their planet. This is a short science fiction book that spends little time on character development or setting the scene. This book is all about imagination, creativity and forcing the reader to think about our place in the universe. In that sense, this book is perfectly executed as the author provides an all encompassing view of 'universal evolution'. There are so many ideas in this book that inspired other movies, books etc that were incubated in the mind of this man."
4,An Early Clarke-ism,"In the words of Stan Ridgway, ""The overlords got me working overtime."" This book sets the stage for Mr. Clarke. It was written in the 1952 or 1953 (sorry I finished it and loaned it out **mistake** I still haven't gotten it back). I really like the way he weaves mythology and science together in this book. This is indeed a classic."
4,great book but only for a few people,"Childhood's End in the aspects of sci-fi and imagination would be great for those who prefer the imagination to reality. The plot to this book is one that you must read to the end just to to understand, and you may even want to read it a few times just to find new and thrilling details that you might have missed. It is a book of unbeliievable description of events and character it is certainly not one to be missed."
5,What a nice change from the ordinary end of the world story!,"What a nice change of pace from the usual end of the world story. Instead of the Aliens coming to enslave the human race (or destroying it so they can find a new home to engulf all of the natural resources from and leave only to do the same to countless others in the universe) they prepare the human race for better things. Of course this means the end of mankind as we know it but in the end it is for the best. Though I thought the book to be a bit choppy, (meaning that in some parts he did not give a detailed account of the outcome from some key situations) but never the less Clarke gets across his views well and I give this book nothing but praise. The characters were great and never did I feel that a certain name didn't fit the personality. Read this book. It isn't very long, so just take a day or two out of your time and give it a go. Either you'll be done with it by then or you won't be able to put it down."
3,OK,Clarke writes excellent and I was bravely entertained. But the ending was not nearly as magnificent as it is put up to be
3,"Unique, but not interesting","The supernatural stuff was wrapped well to fit the SF context. He explored possibilities beyond other SF writers at his time. However, there's nothing interesting about the plot. I don't think Clarke was really trying to tell a good story. He was exploring the limits of SF writing, and he did a great job. This is more like a literature than a novel."
5,One of the Finest Books I've Ever Read,"I borrowed ""Childhood's End"" from a friend and didn't expect very much. I'm no fan of Sci Fi most of the time (which more often than not seems to veer dangerously into Star Trek-ish geekery), but my friend reassured me that much more was going on here; namely, real humanity and spirituality of a sort. Despite what I've seen in other reviews of the book, I didn't feel at all cheated at the end - in fact, I felt a sense of peace and wonder: could it really be this way? If so, I'm all for it! Well worth checking out."
5,One of the Best Ever,"What more can I say? Epic in scope, beautifully written, interesting throughout ... Clarke is just the best. I would rather read bad Arthur Clarke, where little happens, and the plot is hackneyed than good stuff from someone else. The guy just knows how to write. And this is one of his best, if not the best. I wish they'd make a movie of it now that the technology to do so exists."
3,Getting driven into sci-fi,"The book talks about how some life forms come to earth from another planet, and try to help the humans on the planet. We see how they struggled to help it and how twisted it becomes. This books keeps you on your heels wondering what is going to happen next or how is it going to end up.I am not into sci-fi, but this book brought me slowly into enjoying it. What I like most about this book is how it made me reluctant to put it down."
3,Childhood's End was different,"An advanced race from a different planet has arrived on Earth. They begin to improve life on earth and seem altruistic. However, their motives are unclear and they were very secretive. With the help of their technology they create a utopia on earth. The Earth and its inhabitants carry on living through the unique symbiosis until fate leads them into crossroads where they must part. Towards the end, everything was destined to be different from before.I am a sci-fi fan, and normally I enjoy anything sci-fi. However, after reading this book, I felt that sci-fi had evolved alot from the old times. The modern sci-fi is not even comparable with the old, in terms of quality and this book is no exception. It is outdated for today's generation of sci-fi books"
4,Not bad.,"Good example of thought-inducing science fiction. Clarke makes the reader contemplate the implications of a true utopian society. Can mankind fully appreciate the rewards of the altruistic Overlords, a race that has come to save humans from self-destruction? Can mankind submit to a rule whose real motives are unknown? The only complaint is the focus on insignificant matters, such as the relationship between Russia and the United States's space program heads in the beginning of the novel. But this is common in science fiction and to be expected. I enjoyed the book, a rare feat for a book to accomplish."
5,Alien invasion - for the thinking person,"Arthur C. Clarke weaves a thought-provoking tale of alien invasion, racial precognition, and human destiny in the story of CHILDHOOD'S END. Where Mark Twain postulated Angels as Beings Who Can Do No Wrong, Clarke goes one better with the Overlords, a devilish race of beings who can only do what's right! A true SF Classic, by the British Master of the genre"
4,Great book,"As everything Clarke has written, this is a great story. While i was reading it, i didn't get much time over. If you like other Clarke books, you should read it, and if you never read anything by this great writer, this is a good start"
2,Episodic and Unsatisfying,"After reading the glorious reviews of the 80+ other readers who decided to share their thoughts, I had high expectations for this novel. I was disappointed. The plot is episodic and baggy, and the ending is corny, but not in a hip retro-fashion either. It's certainly not a ""classic"" of science fiction. Read Sturgeon or Asimov before you waste your time on this."
2,Another Day,"You probably won't be in the middle on Another Earth; either you'll find it to be a hypnotic meditation on fate and circumstance or a pretentious, self-serious snoozer. Regardless, few would call it conventional. It's the tale of an aspiring astrophysicist whose carelessness changes the life of a brilliant composer forever; now that a new planet exactly like ours has been discovered, can our heroine get a second chance to make everything right? Brit Marling stars and co-wrote the screenplay for Another Earth, and the film offers proof of her unique talent -- just don't expect a typical sci-fi story."
1,Where's the science?,"I had seen the trailer and was horrified by the idea of what would happen to Earth and other planets due to the gravity suck of this new planet. Hell, the planet couldn't even have gotten there, without major astrophysical calamity! I wanted desperately to see how this would be handled. It wasn't. This and the hundreds of other scientific issues were not addressed, much to my disgust.After wasting my time and money, I was given to understand that the entire charade was a metaphor for personal growth and renewal. I feel like throwing rotten tomatoes at the rental box."
2,TOO MUCH OF THE SAD WORLD WE KNOW AND NOT ENOUGH OF THE OTHER WE DON'T,"The far-fetchedness of this story belies the notion that nothing should really surprise us in our age of near magical technology and discovery. In a mundane world of sadness and tragedy, what would happen if another version of our earth suddenly appeared? This attempt at a psychological sci-fi tale inverts the known with the unknown and teases with all the possibilities therein.I wish there were much more joy and mystery in this unusual film of hope amidst the ordinary. But this is still definitely worth a look. In my opinion, some of the deleted scenes would've helped finesse the story about this young woman dealing with the pain of causing a tragic accident.It's too much of the world we know and not enough of the other."
1,Waste of time,"I thought if I kept watching it would get better...sadly, it did not. Nothing about the movie was above average. Slow moving too."
3,another me,"if there is another me on another earth, i hope i dont watch this movie. moves very slow, wait for the weekend movie deal when its less money."
5,Wow,"Not many movies have hit me like this. A young woman has ruined 4 lives, including her own, and must live with it.Brit Marling is brilliant. I will be looking for more great things from her."
5,Exceptional,"Now one of my favorites. Solid writing, storytelling that is accentuated by Brit's outstanding performance. Mapother also does well but seems to be over-acting at a point or two. The ending, which is both subtle and remarkable, was brilliantly photographed. The overall premise is a bit much but the movie, as a whole, is remarkable."
4,Brit Marling is a force to watch,"Brit Marling the lead actress in this film also co-wrote the film apparently as a way to get good roles to act. Her plan worked.This film ""Another Earth"" has a gritty indi quality to it, and it demands more than most films from its viewers, but it's well worth the effort.I look forward to other good stuff out of her -- both performing and writing including her other debut film ""Sound of my Voice""."
3,West Haven Lifer,"Great idea for a series. So many possibilities! Rented the movie just because I grew up in West Haven and was filmed mostly at my old high school and surrounding communities. Also there are a few extra's I know that are in the movie.Oh, you wanted a movie review? Sorry. Love Sci-Fi and for an independant movie, you can't get much better than this. Found the story line ok, acting came up a little short. However, the same people acted, directed, and wrote the movie, you have to give this A but only three stars on the board. Fantasic plot, again, with so many possibilities."
1,Not what I thought it was,"The premise of the trailer is that this is another ""Contact"" but not to be, just a wasted premise. The movie would be fine if it had nothing to do with a duplicate earth because as you watch it (or at least in my opinion) the twin earth has absolutely nothing to do with the story. What a waste of a great premise. If you wonder why this flopped at the box office it is because the movie is bait and switch."
3,nice drama with a scifi backdrop,"This film deserves a watch, if you like scifi that aspires to be serious drama. A promising student get sidetracked, falling into a life situation from which she appears unable to recover. It carries a burden of guilt and she does her best to atone for it. In the background, a kind of mysterious parallel Earth is discovered nearby, a duplicate in every apparent way, right down to the humans that live on it. This new earth gets the characters to question things in a realistic and interesting way. The actress is extremely beautiful and quite good. Unfortunately, beyond the emotional redemption, not a heckuvalot happens, which disappointed me. It is very low key hard scifi. Recommended."
2,Dull!,I loved the idea of this movie but the plot just went on way too long. Not much for main character development. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone. Quality not as bad as I expected but not enough story here to keep my interest. After paying to see it I stuck it out to the bitter end. Hindsight would suggest it was a waste of my time.
2,Where's the substance?,"This film is a small, artsy independent film and it shows just a bit too much. Most of the film is consumed by silence. The silence isn't filled with stunning visual images or movement, but rather just the main character Rhoda being depressed with her lot in life. Unlike say 2001: Space Odyssey, where the silence has meaning, here in this movie it's simply boring.The whole concept of the second Earth is supposed to be a philosophical metaphor for the fact that small acts of luck/misfortune can dramatically alter somebody's life. However, it's a bit overdone. The whole concept of a second Earth literally just hanging out in space next to ours is way too unrealistic and unscientific to carry the film. Viewers can't take it seriously. Other sci-fi movies movies have explored the concept of decisions and chance in life with much more grace and entertainment."
1,No wonder iTunes won't sell it!,One of the worst movies I have ever seen! I can't believe I even sat threw it in hopes that it would get better. Wish I spent the money on bird food or bottled water!
1,misleading and horrible,Can't anyone make a movie anymore. This is not at all about another Earth. It's just another poorly played sappy movie. Don't waste your time or money!
1,Total Chick Flick - a real snooze,"It's bad enough that I took several astronomy classes, I'm willing to overlook the implausible if the movie is still good, such as Sagan's Contact, but this movie was implausible AND dragged on forever.. when it looked like she finally won the golden ticket to Willly Wonka's chocolate factory, Earth 2, the movie ended. WHAT!?! I waited thru all that for what? Why had no one on Amazon written a true review? SO MEN, BE WARNED. THIS IS A TOTAL CHICK FLICK. And I admit I like the occasional well-done such flick, ie, Sleepless in Seattle, Serendipity, You've Got Mail... but this is no Sleepless. In fact, this movie is the cure for insomnia. Snooze-ville. G'luck if you rent it, but you've been warned."
2,"Depressing story, interesting but flawed concept.",Meh.. made me fall asleep. My girlfriend too. And we both have very different tastes in movies. I say pass on this one it's bleh at best.
2,Would not watch again.,"While the story potential did exist with this movie, it fell flat. Even the filmography left a lot to be desired in that it was monotonous throughout. We rented it expecting it to be about the girl's journey to the second earth, instead it was about her 'self-journey'. I found the relationship with John to be creepy and found Rhoda to be remarkably selfish. Would I watch it again, no. And did I pick up the laptop halfway through and start surfing the net, yes. Had the story pacing been better, it would have worked somewhat. And just when it was starting to get good with her faced with the 'other' her, the movie ended."
2,Mildly interesting and slow paced,I'm amazed I was able to stay awake for this movie. The story line could have been more creative. It seemed like they had to reach for ideas on how to fill time.
3,"Interesting, but slow.","""Another Earth"" is a slow drama that revolves around a tragedy. This is an important point since the title and cover may give a different impression. There is little science-fiction; the other earth is mostly a side note and a catalyst for some speculative discussions in the film.I found the film interesting, but overly slow and artsy. By the end I was looking forward to the film coming to its conclusion, only to have it conclude where I wanted it to continue! Still, it was a thought-provoking finish that is perhaps best left for speculation.The acting is decent, but does fall flat at times. It definitely has the look and feel of a low-budget indie film, so it may not be for everyone."
4,Just Got the Meaning (SPOILER),"Well I watched the movie last night and the ending was so abrupt I was left confused.It could have lasted long enough for the two Rhodas to talk about what happened. Now this morning, thinking about the movie I understood. If Rhoda was seeing herself on earth then the Other Earth story ended different and she DID take the trip. Loved the story. My 13 year old grand daughter loved it also."
5,gift,"I haven't seen this movie, but it was on my Grandson's wish list and he was very pleased to receive it for Christmas."
2,"Small, not full sized, never mentioned that","Student guitar to me, some one who doesnt really know any thing about guitars but likes the sound of them, just means cheaper quality materials and wood and what not. Not smaller size. Sounds off in the tune as well. I'm going to try with nylon strings but steel core is not for this guitar. I wish I put more effort in finding a good cheap guitar, this is not it.The color is good though & it will be prefect for some one who's never played guitar to get used to tuning and fretting, but if you know how to hold one, tune and strum, then you want a better guitar."
2,this software is really buggy,"during certain parts of the game, each super hero has to ""hover"" over hotspots, and click ""B"" in order to execute a power, but ""B"" is also an action button....so, you could be fighting, and then have to ""hover"" and wait for the software to figure out that you are there, and not waiting to fight. And once you are there, you have to do some dumb sequence of keystokes, in order to get the super hero to execute the move.Mr. Fantastic has to figure out some dumb puzzle!Sue has to spin the directional control really fast.johnny and ben have to hit the ""A"" button really fast!i, too, paid full price."
2,Wish I had left it on the shelf,"I bought this game hoping that it would have the same gameplay as x-men legends, which by the way is an excellent game. This game however does not deliver. I don't know if it was the horrible camera angles or boring gameplay but I just did not want to finish this game. I am returning this and anxiously awaiting X-Men Legends 2."
2,Boring!,"Alright, its fun every once in awhile but it gets old fast...If you like mindless button pushing and fighting mole-men, stone aztec things, and now mummies then you should still find a different game then this one. I know it's hard to make a video game that doesn't envolve mindless button pushing but this one doesn't even make an effort to differ from that.What they should do is put games like this out on PSP where you wouldn't mind pushing buttons because you'd be traveling or trying to pass the time. I actually think it would be more fun on PSP because with large systems you expect a lot which, this game didn't bring."
3,Not So Fantastic,"This is an OK game. Some of the levels are a little challenging because if you die you have to start over in that level. Kids will have a hard time with the game and even some adults. However, if you like the Fantastic Four you can get it, but might as well get Number 2 instead."
4,Dean Jones as you've never seen him,"Strong characters, the way we want our heroes to be. Led by a little girl, with the faith in justice instilled by her father, this is a warm family film on overcoming obstacles to right social injustice. Characters loosely based on real people from author's own neighborhood."
2,Old book with good info.,"Original pulished in 1971, this is definitely an older marine book. Surprisingly though, it has some good relavent info. For example, their is an equipment section where the advantages of protein skimming and ozonizers are discussed. The heart of the book though is its discussion on marine fish. Mr. Cox does a nice job of discussing fish behaviors, vulnerabilities to disease, etc. Pictures of fish are hand drawn paintings, and though good I would perfer a nice picture. Overall it is a good book, but there are other reef books that are much more new and better."
3,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"Live action comedy about a man who fights crime with the help of his gadgets. It's really funny but the plot is stupid. Not a terrible movie, yet not a great movie either. Matthew Broderick does do a good job as Inspector Gadget, but Dr. Claw isn't anything like he was in the T.V. show and Gadgets talking car is extremely anoying. In other words it's funny and has good special effects, but the plot isn't good! They should have said Go Go Gadget get a better script!"
1,this movie is too short,"when i watched this,it only seemed like an hour long.when i saw the previews,i knew it would only get one star,because it looked corny and boring.and ususally i am wrong when that happens,but this time i was absolutely right about it.unfunny and boring"
1,LACKS EVERYTHING A GOOD MOVIE CONTAINS,"there's is nothing more i can say about this absolutely pathetic, only for kids, movie than what's in the title. the actors seemed stiff, uninterested, and unemotional. rupert everett was absolutely horrible as dr. claw and broderick was the worst possible actor to be signed on as the crafty inspector we have all grown to love through the cartoon. the movie is based around a diabolical accident that forces a regular cop (broderick) to become a gadget-ridden man out to protect justice. basically the rest of this monotonous film includes crazy, ""non"" action sequencences, which build up to a ""climatic"" encounter with claw (everett). along the way, gadget falls in love with a scientist and receives useless advice from his ""crackpot"" daughter (michelle trachtenberg) and useless dog, brain! fine to see with the kids, but don't expect to savour it on a free saturday night."
1,"Disappointing,.","It can't get worser than this! This is a bad, kids movie that has a plot with no point, actors with talent but have lost it here. I put faith in Matthew Broderick in alot of films, and he sucks in this one. And as for the Claw guy, your a bad actor! Get rid of him! Hardly entertaining and a very big disappointment. This is as bad as KULL THE CONQUEROR! Yuk!"
3,eh...,"This wasn't a very good movie for one that got released to theaters. If anything, this movie had more of a B-quality, direct-to-video feel of it because of the plot and acting. I remember the original cartoon, and while of course you can't expect a movie to be exactly the same as the source content, I found this movie to be lacking in quality because of the writing and storyline itself. Some parts were just stupid or cheesy, leaving this as a movie to be watched on TV as opposed to being bought and added to one's movie collection, or even renting - I seriously wouldn't get this even for a dollar from a Redbox."
2,Same or different?,"The Disney movie: Inspector Gadget was release to DVD on December 7, 1999. Why was this release again? Is it because the studio put together the deleted scenes that we didn't see from the preview? If not then why? Most of the Americans would like to see the scenes that weren't on the whole plot if there was a special edition or a 10th anniversary edition for it since it's been 11 years when it was released or it can be a different number for an anniversary edition"
4,Inspector Gadget,Product received in a timely manner. The DVD was in excellent shape and serves our purposes.
3,Good Movie,Mathew Brotheric is always a funny actor...good story and entertaining to watch with the whole family!
5,inspector gadget,"love the movie, was the first movie I went to with my husband and my 3 year old grandson. It was wondeful then as it is now."
3,fun and funny for the young,"i wouldn't really reccomend this movie for the older crowd who remember the 80's cartoon series. i think it was cool to learn the stuff like how he became the gadget guy. the acting was great! i agree with someone i saw that said in this movie the letters should self distruct! that would be hysterical. im sorry but i just couldn't accept that inspector gadget is self sufficient in this movie. in the cartoon series penny and brain were always having to save her uncle's butt! they should have gone more closely to the show! oh well. it's fun and a little funny because as usual matthew broderick is cute and funny and charming! maybe part II will be more closely tied to the show... but overall i would rent it not buy it. but your little boys, ill bet will absolutely love this movie!"
3,DVD Beats Video; Plot Could Be Thicker...,"Even though I liked this movie, I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It runs barely over an hour, whereas I was expecting a feature-length movie. Even so, I did eventually check my watch near the middle of the movie.The comedic bits in the movie are worth seeing, especially with the Gadgetmobile. The credits are also worth it, as they are inturrupted from time to time. Perhaps the best special feature on the DVD is the Youngstown music video."
3,Fun but lacking,"Great special effects for Inspector Gadget, but the film resembles the cartoon very little -- Gadget's not very bumbling, Peggy's hardly involved. Brain doesn't do much. Claw is too nice. This version has a technical glitch in the first chapter 1 where the French version pops into the English version for about 10 seconds."
4,Cute.,"This movie is cute but not for all ages. Kids would greatly enjoy this,most adults would think of it as silly. It's about John Brown (Matthew Broderick) getting into a car accident then is transformed into Inspector Gadget,a robot in other words,by many doctors. At first he does not like this new change,but he gets used to it after a while. I say it's a cute movie and i would recommend it to people that enjoy silly movies. If not,then do not see it...I would highly recommend it to the young-ones."
4,It's Cool,I think that this film is really good although not everybody likes it. The actors were good.My only objection is that the guy with the claw did not laugh the way he should. I loved it!
4,One Of Disney's Better Live-Action Efforts,"Wowzer!Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, one of the better live-action kids' films I've ever seen. Once Matthew Broderick is turned into ""Inspector Gadget,"" the film becomes very inventive with a lot of cool gadgets and a lot of neat things to see and hear (great movie for surround sound.)Broderick is a likable hero and even Rupert Everett as the villain is, too, producing some laughs. There are enough adult-type jokes to clever material to make this fun for us older folks. I'd have to say this is one of the better efforts ever by the Disney company.Broderick plays two roles, and is especially funny as the counterfeit Gadget with the fake teeth. The little girl in here is cute, too, and the talking car has some of the best lines of the film. At under 80 minutes, the film breezes by at good clip."
1,"If something isn't broken, why bother fixing it?","A voice over in a commercial for reruns of the Inspector Gadget cartoon once stated ""he's the original RoboCop."" This cartoon had a kick@$$ theme song and Don Adams of ""Get Smart"" was perfectly cast as the voice of the bumbling mechanical detective.Now for the movie review, where I do I even begin? It's painfully obvious Disney hasn't got much talent or creativity as far as updating a retro cartoon to keep up with the times. First they gave us a movie adaptation of Inspector Gadget followed by Underdog a few years later. Neither one of these movies can match the witty and clever nostalgia of these two animated series.Wowsers... this movie is a waste of time and talent that should have been direct to video if nothing else. Just watch it and you'll see why it didn't do well at the box office. Oh well, maybe another movie studio will get it right next time with a better cast and more experienced movie director. Go go Gadget reboot!"
3,Go Go Get Another One,This tape has the disney trademark on the front. To me that automatically means that it is good. For the most part it was not a scratch on the old cartoon with the storyline sagging in parts. The animation is pretty good but fans of the cartoon will be sorely disappointed. The car is also very annoying and i think they could have hired better actors. Overall this video is not the best but could eventually get there.
5,A good movie purely for Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everet.,"This movie was not the best representation for the original show, but it was very good in virtue of wanting to see Matthew Broderick, and Rupert Everet. It has a few funny lines, and a fair story line. It was overall watchable, and enjoyable. I suggest the original show much more then the movie."
1,How can one film be so bad?,"That's a question you'lll be asking yourself time and time again as you watch Inspector Gadget. Granted it's for kids but Disney should really give children a little more credit. Rather than going into all the different ways this film fails(something that would take hours), I will just simply say you have better things to do with your life than watching this movie."
3,Quite good.,This video is quite good but there are other videos of cartoons you would rather prefer.Eg-Casper a spirited begining or spiderman.
3,Sugar Ain't Always Sweet,"Sugar Ain't Always Sweet and neither is love.Sometimes love can take a sour twist.First comes love then comes marriage, there goes Bernard and Simone down the rocky roads of marriage.Having been together for 16 years and marriaged for 10 of those years each learned a valuable lesson.It is so strange to learn how Simone forgives but Bernard was not will to .No, two wrongs does not make it right but Bernard had to go thru a few thing to learn.Kathleen on the other side of Bernard had to also learn a lesson about married men. All in all I think they each learned.Sugar ain't always sweet and neither is love."
2,"FYI: This item is not related to the show ""The Honeymooners""","To avoid any confusion. This item has nothing to do with the TV show ""The Honeymooners"". It is a box in which couples can place their photos and memories from their wedding honeymoon."
1,These dolls don't work with Vista,"Okay so both my daughter and niece are into Bratz and since they both also enjoy playing online I thought the Be-Bratz dolls were the perfect combination of the two activities..... WRONG!!!!!!!! I just so happened to buy a new computer earlier this year which came with Vista pre-installed and as per the norm, the Be-Bratz site is not compatible with the dolls (or the USB key that comes with them) yet. I would've thought that with Vista being out for a few months now that 95% of sites would be compatible, esp the Be-Bratz site because these dolls haven't been out very long. What a waste of $60!!!"
4,wicked bad,"for those of you who love the lonelyness of listening to music nobody else can share with you and dancing like nobody else dances this will perfectly suit your needs. don't get me wrong - i played out of your mind to several people and some did like it but it's no music to march to, to wave the american (or as in my case the german) flag at. it's teenage riot time. it'S the music for fast train rides, when you stand between cars and see small portions of the rails under your feet. one can dance to it and one can cheer to it during bumpy rides up to the black forest. I wish to listen to it sitting on a huge log drifting north towards olympia, wash. and hitting puget sound with it. 4 stars because the halo benders occupy the 5ht. thanks cal! next time you should get liz phair as a duet partner."
4,out-of-date coupon,"I have been using Xtreme 3 blades and razors ever since they came out. It is a good product, but every now and then you will find that the $1 coupon enclosed is out of date when you buy blades. I bought a package of 4 blades last week (Jan. 06) that had an expiration date of ll/30/05."
3,I'm waiting to be impressed,"With that voice and guitar talent, Warren could, (and I say could), rule the world of blues music - but it hasn't happened yet.Someone please write this man some good songs and make him record them so we can enjoy his talent."
4,not ordinary,if you like blues/rock you should like Warren Haynes.I think this line up is conditionally better than Gov't Mule.add some fresh older music to your library.
1,Didn't get what I selected,"This is not a review for the wilkinson blades themselves, which are awesome (5 stars). I selected to purchase 100 blades for $18.95. The title above said 50ct. If I had received 50 I would have been ok with it (cost a bit higher than local, but saved me a trip to the store); however, I received 10 blades for $14.54. They sell locally for around $1.25 for a 5 pack. Two dollars fifty is no where near $14.54 and since it isn't what I signed up for, Kay Beauty: I will absolutely be returning these."
1,Very expensive,"I think the wording is deceiving, saying 5 cartriges instead of saying 5 blades gives a buyer the incorrect impression. I would not have bought that product if I had known I was getting only 5 blades for that price."
3,Nice but nothing special,"As with all razor blades, they perform differently for different people. These do OK for me, but Feather blades do better. Other people might get different results, therefore my advise: Get a 10 pack of multiple brands and try them out and stick with what works for you"
5,Revlon blusher - SkinLights creme,This is my very favorite blusher of all time! They stopped making it and I stocked up from this site. It is moist and leaves you with dewy skin....and at 69 I can use all the help I can get! LOL Excellent results....Revlon should go back to producing it! Dr. B
3,too narrow,"This item is nice and cleans well, great for toast, however not too useful for anything much else as the tongs part is so narrow it doesn't grasp too much. Would not purchase again."
1,Too thin and small,This product is too small and thin to hold anything in the kitchen. Its not very sturdy either. I probably wouldnt buy this brand again
3,"Love the Bamboo, BUT . . .","I really like the bamboo line, but these tongs are not so great for me. Just my opinion. They are good for bigger food, not so great for bacon. It's hard to pick up thin food. Still, love the bamboo! Just remember to always wash on your top rack of your dishwasher."
2,Connor is awful even has a baby,"Overall Angel is a great series, and I hesitate to give season three such low marks but lets be honest, Connor was a mistake, such a huge mistake in the current season he is all but forgotten and never mentioned (rarely). Darla having a baby not entirely interesting though Darla is interesting pregenant Darla is whiny and uninteresting.Second, Gunn and Fred love angle, another low point of the entire series, again the obvious love story between Wesley and Fred is put off for this very fake love story between Gunn and Fred.Third, I just can't get it out of my head Angel trying to kill Wesley while he was unconcious, one of the worst scenes ever in the history of Angel, its hard to forget or forgive.The fact I note so many people giving this season such high marks realy ignores these important points, I hope anyone thinking of purchasing this otherwise excellent series will take these points into consideration."
4,"Excellent standards, great show, great season","The hard reality is that Angel was a better show than Buffy (of course, there would not ever have been an Angel without Buffy).Angel is much more well crafted than Buffy's (especially Buffy's last two seasons)and the characters and plots are more coeherent.This third season is very good and reaaaaaaally dark. I thought Connor was an annoying character."
1,I can't speak for the show itself,"Because Amazon's streaming/downloading service is so terrible that I've been unable to watch it yet. Their Unbox application won't pause downloads, and when I finally had the time to sit around and let the download go from start to finish, the player then did nothing but play audio and display frozen video frames. FAIL. (I'm running Win 7 pro 64 bit. There may be compatibility issues, but if there are, not only did amazon not make that clear, it would also be yet another fail.)"
4,Great Performances...one little niggle,"Although I am in full agreement with most of the reviews which extol the performances while accepting the sound quality limitations of the 1958 Sofia live recording,I have a minor niggle with the booklet tracklisting for CD 1 which is incorrect so far as ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is concerned in that track 5 following the Old Castle is shown as the Tulleries when in fact a Promenade actually track 5 and Tulleries track 6. All subsequent tracks are then out of step by one track until Cum mortuis is reached which is also omitted.Amazon's own track listing is correct for ""Pictures..."" but then omits the actual track 17 of Schubert's Moment musical. You just can't win! I just had to renumber the whole listing in the booklet..."
3,"Cough, cough !","First, Richter is a superb pianist and these recordings demonstrate his musical genius. Several other reviewers have generously awarded this cd five stars in recognition of Richter's art. However, the production quality is mediocre and the music is frequent interrupted by fits of coughing from members of the audience. Perhaps there was a flu outbreak in Sofia in February 1958 (the date of the Moussorgsky recording) or perhaps the Communist regime was rationing cough-drops. Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile purchase."
1,Extreme Home Makeover,"When placing my order, I wanted ""how to repair Mobil Homes books"".this book is very misleading...........it a book of ""Jokes"".Waste of money if you are trying to repair your Mobil Home..........hope others do not fall for this as a repair mannual.Sincerely MeMe"
3,good but too short,"I might have just missed the detail before I ordered this, but its a bit on the short side and doesn't get close to the ground as it drapes from my grill. No where as close as in the photo. Otherwise, looks and feels like quality material."
3,Here's the correct measurement....,"The pic is wrong - my grill is 51x21x48 and this cover is actually 53x21x35. This is the measurement printed on the packaging. So, while it looks long in the pic, it really does not go all the way down. Since the material is not paper thin, I will keep it and buy a larger one (probanly different brand) to go on top of this cover to give my grill extra protection, since eventually the sharp corners of the grill will tear the covers, regardless."
2,Didn't last long,"I purchased this grill cover in June 2009. We are now in Sep 2010 and the cover has been tearing for the last 2 months as I remove it and put it back on my grill. I leave my grill in an uncovered area so it is exposed to the sun. It could be that the material is not UV resistant. The item descrption makes no claim of having UV inhibitors but it does imply that it will protect outdoor living furniture and grills from the elements. To me that means it will stand up to the elements when protecting your gear. It is a nice cover and I think it would be great if it didn't deteriorate so quickly. So if you keep your grill in a protected area this might be for you. If you leave your grill out in the elements, I suggest you look for another type of material."
3,Great if you like mini-skirts,"Like a previous reviewer said, This cover is very short. It is proportioned nothing like the photo.There is about a foot of grill left uncovered in my case.I bought this to match the covers on the rest of my patio furniture and for that reason I will probably keep it, but be warned this this is like a mini-skirt for your grill, or maybe capri pants would be more appropriate."
4,Great book on determination and never being too old!,"Great book for people who enjoy cycling, and/or who believe you're never too old to follow your passion! Very fun true story. Didn't listen to the cd b/c I bought it as a gift."
4,"well detailed for size and ""scale""","This kit is very easy to build due to the small number of parts, and thanks to the amount of space inside model, makes adding a lighting kit easily possible. It makes a more impressive display when a fiber optic/LED kit is installed. Very accurately molded for a mass-produced model, and no imperial ""fleet"" collection is complete without at least one!"
3,Not meant for bad knees,This might actually be a good video for a younger person or anyone that doesn't have one bad knee and one worse one. Altough it is tagged as low impact the quick sharp moves were too much for my knees. I gave this away and hope they will use it in good health.Maybe there needs to be an additional rating Low Impact-Decrepit
4,You will feel this the next day,This is a great workout. It will raise your heartbeat and make you swet. I like the timer on the screen showing the time to go on each interval. Cueing is good and instructer in good.
3,It's alright,The video is alright. It's not what I expected. Maybe because I'm used to more upbeat instructors. I did the workout yesterday and had to follow it up with another video because I didn't feel like I got a workout.
5,"Boring, I guess, but sometimes routine is good","I like this video for the routine. I work out at 5 a.m., and I don't always want to have to think about my exercise. Use this as part of an exercise library, and you won't be sorry. Another plus, low impact option. I cannot do all of the kickboxing, bouncing, jumping, squatting moves of other videos, and I appreciate this program for having three people performing all three options: high, regular, and low impact. Easy moves, easy to follow with countdown clock."
2,Just jumping up and down = Boring,"I like the custom programming of this dvd, but that is where my appreication for it ends. The moves are BORING! Its basically just variations of jumping up and down. Its an intense workout, but its hard to stay motivated."
5,Train for Your Body Type,"One thing that I love about the workout DVD is option to customize it! Jessica Smith is chatty, but not annoying."
5,WELL WORTH IT!,"WOW, this hasn't it all! It has all your scuplting(i.e upper, lower, abs). Also includes power yoga and long or short cardio the longer one is a little more intense and the shorter ones are easier! It's also customizable or you can follow there pre-built for you body weekly plans which are completly reasonable! It is well worth it's a total of 82 minutes long! YOU HAVE TO GET IT!"
5,Marvelous!,"I love that they give you different levels for each exercise so that once the ""low impact"" options become too easy I'll be able to step it up to the ""high impact"" options. I love that you can tailor it to your own needs/level and the instructor is upbeat but not so chipper you want to scream after the first week. I'd definitely recommend this one."
2,Average,These are light weight cast aluminum spacers. I used these on my car and for whatever reason the cause a vibrations and made this noise like they were moving around whenever i went over bumps. I ended up buying billet aluminum spacer from ebay that were 100 times better and experienced no issues. i would suggest look for better spacers before buying these.
4,Parts needed,"I have read these reviews, look dork, if you know anything about wheels and vehicles you would know it is possible you need to change the studs. Don't give bad remarks for crap you don't know!!!!"
2,it would have helped..,"if the seller would have wrote down before hand that these are not for use on suv's, 4x4s, trucks etc. and the fact that longer studs are required, i wouldn't have bought these. I just wasted 20 something bucks yayyy!"
1,FEEBLE VOICE!,"I read all the reviews and since they were all favourable I bought this CD. Alas! I was deeply disappointed. All these laudatory comments turned out to be just pompous array of praises. Barbara Bonney has clear,but weak voice. She is whispering something indistinctly, not singing. I worship Mozart and still I was not moved by this rendition.I wonder whether at a real performance the audience in the rear seats ever hear what she is singing.These Mozart's arias are really great but they must be performed by great artists as well. A diva possessed of deep ,clear,strong voice will do the job perfectly."
5,On Your Mark. Get Set. Go!,"We purchased these race cars for our daughter when she was around 2. They quickly became a favorite for her as we would all sit on the kitchen floor, rev the cars up to full capacity and then let em' go! They'd race around the kitchen banging into the cabinets which causes them to bounce off and head in another direction evoking fits of laughter from our little one (and us!).Eventually one of the cars stopped working - I think it's possible it was ""rev'd"" in the wrong direction too many times. We are very fond of WOW toys as they seem virtually indestructible (we own several other pieces) but the cars, or rather one car, didn't hold up quite as well as we would have expected. We've also given the cars as a gift to several friends and they were a big hit with the kids. I would still buy them again and have even considered buying another set for my now 2 year old son - I know he'll love them. For the price, the time we had to play with then was still worth every penny."
4,Battery Free Fun!,We bought this as a birthday gift for a 2 year old. His parents love these cars because they are battery free and the little figurines can be removed from the car. They also like the pull back feature.
1,"Disasters, all right! Disasters of the cinema arts!","These, folks, are cheesy shows. You watch the first (Virus) and wonder how a film could be worse. But you watch the second (Hurricane) and realize that yes, it is possible to make an even worse movie than Virus. But boy oh boy, when you get to number 3 (Deadly Harvest) you realize that the impossible has been made manifest! It is also stunningly awful!In short (the films aren't worth more than that), the productions are cheap and sleazy, the actors are off their feed (if indeed, they'd eaten from the apple of talent at all), the settings are lousy, most of the footage is stock footage, and some shots are even repeated. The scores match all of this in quality. But the DVD presentation equals the worst I have seen on the medium (a cheapo early DVD of Metropolus, where all the subtitles were trimmed off left and right). The film is grainy, they are too dark, etc. etc. etc.The reason to own these epics? If you are an exhaustive collector of the"
3,A bit dated....,"This small group of films is pretty much what one would expect from the television movies of the times. Still, it was interesting to see the footage of Hurricane Camille. Still, it was worth it to me to see some of the actors still in their heyday."
1,wont play,"dvd would not play in dvd player or my computer,i had to download to my computer then convert to avi then i could watch it,but quality was so bad i could barly see the movie,2v/6/a"
4,Another great album,"I loved her first album, and so far this one seems about as good. She has a very distinctive voice and apparently a bit of a speech impediment, so it's kind of a love it or hate it thing. I've learned to dig it, my wife not so much. Her songs are very well crafted, intelligently covering various topics. I hope there is a third album in her future!"
4,A Well Crafted and Moving Album !,"I got to know about Polly Paulusma via her YouTube site [...]Once I heard her rendering the acoustic versions of this album, I must get itasap! There are 10 songs in this album and I really love some of her lyrics.The recording is superb and well defined.My favorites are Godgrudge, Ready or Not and All the Time.This is my album of the month, if not year 2007!"
5,The best children's poetry book (just learning to read & on),"This book of enjoyable, amusing, and well made poetry alternates poems to be read by adults to children with poems to be read by children to adults. Since I was 8 I've loved it, my child now gives it as a gift at every birthday party"
2,structure,no in the typical style -- no bold face or set off words to make it easy for double reading
1,Not what I was looking for,"I work with elementary age children and they just love the ""You read to me, I read to you"" books. I purchased this one (along with another) and this book is at a much higher level. The biggest issue is that it is not clear who reads what....which is the whole purpose of these sorts of books.... So, the book is useless to me."
1,This book glorifies corporal punishment.,"I thought this would be fun to read to (and eventually with) my four year old step-grandchild until I flipped through the pages. Boy, was I wrong! The drawing that accompanies the first poem, ""About The Teeth of Sharks"" was entirely inappropriate for a young child--better suited for the movie ""Jaws."" I could have just avoided that page, but then I kept flipping through...hidden at the back of the book were poems that treated corporal punishment as a normal and acceptable way of bringing up a child, for example ""How the Frightful Child Grew Better,"" and ""What Do You Think His Daddy Did."""
5,Good quality for the price,"Not much to say here, very inexpensive ballistic eyeware that I used regularly for about two weeks. They fit fine, had no issues with soreness, and worked effectively as sunglasses. Fortunately I did not have to test the ballistic capability, so I can't say much about that. Overall, great pair of cheap ballistic sunglasses."
3,Only one of the 5 is really good,"Cat of many Tails is excellent. The rest mostly show Queen in decline. 4 or 5 stars for that one novel, the rest 2 or 3."
4,Ellery Queen: 5 Complete Novels,I got this for my daughter. I had to replace her other copy which was ruined by our foster dog.
4,A great reference for Collectors,"As is typical with this series, the books are great for collectors looking to complete sets. These books are also useful to anyone who plays regularly and is looking for information on cards that can help them beef up their decks."
3,A charming book.,"The storyline of this book is fairly predictable: the little raven is shunned by the other animals when he is greedy and takes their playthings, but he is forgiven as soon as he apologizes and gives the toys back. The illustrations, however, are fun to look at and make the story more interesting. There are plenty of little details to discover on each page, and the characters and their toys are pleasant to look at. The book ends up being an enjoyable read."
1,Disappointing,"The toy looked good in the ad but it was a big disappointment. It propels a small (3"") motorcycle, which has a very sharp tip, a distance of about 8 inches across a smooth surface. Not much fun in that! I doesn't work at all on any type of carpeting, cement, or other rough surfaces. Chain restaurants give out much better free toys in their ""kiddie meals""."
2,Not a complete manual,"This book is very basic and does not cover many things this software can do. I eventually purchased two other manuals to help me through photo editing. It does give a nice step by step approach to doing some basics, but can be very limiting as a basic reference."
3,Average,"The title is impressive, but that's about it. 'Turbulent Genius of Garry Kasparov'? Just where was the turbulency? Although Kasparov has personal problems, just like everyone else, I really didn't see a tourtured soul. The subtitle was misleading. The book read more like a second draft rather than a finished copy. I think the author was in a hurry to finish it before a deadline because his writing is not very impressive or convincing. Nevertheless, there are some fine moments, especially some sections of Kasparov's match with Karpov. But on the other hand, Garry is not the most intersting person in the world. One of the greatest chess players ever, but certainly not a man one would want to write and entire book about. The book faltered there; it was about a genius with an average personality."
1,Garbage,"This strap is terrible. I've bought 4 straps so far, this was the most expensive yet. It's the worst thing I've ever used. Feels so cheap, not real leather, feels synthetic and very cheap. I hate it. If you like tweed, go for official Fender tweed straps."
3,Lacks some important information,"At first this book seemed great, but now that I have had to work a lot with JSPs, I have seen some serious shortcomings. The TagExtraInfo class get's way too little coverage. The book doesn't even begin to explain how to actually use it in real work. That's a serious shortcoming."
5,AN excellent JSP book,"Have you worked with JSP? Do you understand how to use JSP to develope database connectivity, XML/XSL and Javabean applications?This is a book for people who wants to completely understand JSP. Excellent logical structure for the learning process with extremly pertinent examples and code. An excellent book, just like other good Core series books from Prentice Hall PTR."
2,"good book, buggy examples",i had a hard time to work with the examples in the book. a half of them simply does not work. some of them are really good when others are too complicated.
3,Needs work,"I would rank this book as mediocre at best. More annoying than the numerous editorial oversights in the text and code (and there are many) are the misuses of terms, both technical and nontechnical. One gets the impression that the authors are trying to write beyond their abilities. It also makes me question the accuracy of the rest of the material when I find such errors on topics with which I am already familiar.Also frustrating is the way a lot of concepts are referenced before being introduced, with no indication that such is the case. If I didn't already know Java very well and have an inkling about JSP coming in, I expect I would have been very confused.I was looking for something that would get me up to speed on JSP quickly and not get too bogged down in details, and in that respect the book did reasonably well. But I gave up on it halfway through because I found it too frustrating. It's not terrible, but with a bit of work and better editing, it could have been a lot better."
2,Examples weren't throroughly tested,Don't know how this text got past the editors. Just about every chapter had typos and syntax errors. Some of the scriptlets had class instantiation problems that needed to be corrected. There were include directives that referenced code that wasn't included on the accompanying CD - nor shown in the book. The JNDI/LDAP section was a joke and the XML didn't work without debugging either.For those giving the book 5 stars - I wonder if they tried the examples or just read the text?
2,Code errors!,"I only just started this book and I am already frustrated. No instructions on how to get the software you need or how to use it. The versions on the CD-ROM are outdated meanwhile. But what is really bad, the first ""useful"" JSP script in chapter 2 is already so full of code errors that you cannot run it! It took me hours of debugging before I made it run - how are you supposed to be debugging the stuff you are supposed to learn from? I will try to read a bit further but probably have to get another book."
3,Overview of JSP technology,"in my opinion, this book provides an overview of jsp and related technologies such as xml and custom tag. the authors are trying to cover breadth insteads of depth. i dislike this book because there are many errors in the sample codes. it is the responsibility of authors/publishers need to run through all the sample codes and make sure that they works."
4,Very good book if you like to learn by doing!,"Very good book if you like to learn by doing, analyze example code and get hands on. If you just want to read about JSP while wading through mundane descriptions and theory than this book is not for you.I would also like to recommend ""Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages"" by Marty Hall, ""Pure JSP"" by James Goodwill and ""JavaServer Pages"" by Ben Forta.Also makes a nice companion to any of the above mentioned books."
1,"Buy ""A Window in Time"" (vol 1 & 2) Instead","These are CD versions of 78rpm records. Because of the source, the dynamic range is limited, the frequency response has similar limitations, and the hiss of the old recordings is always present.Do yourself a favor: Buy ""A Window in Time"". Ignore the reviewer's comment about their source being piano rolls. Even Rachmaninoff said of his piano rolls, ""Now I have finally heard myself play."" even though he had previously heard his audio recordings. The piano rolls had additional holes for recording Rachmaninoff's expression, hence why they capture all the vibrancy and subtlety of his playing.If you are a completist or such a Rachmaninoff fan that there is something here not captured elsewhere, go ahead, buy these discs, but buyer beware!"
3,so so,"fan is aesthetically pleasing, the lowest speed doesn't work while oscillating, it gets stuck."
1,iskin,"This is great for protecting your ipod but when I went to use the belt clip for the first time, it broke. Needless to say ,I was pissed."
3,So much for tagless....,"I purchased this color shirt along with several others in the same ""FTL Lofteez Tagless"" brand. A few of the colors were NOT tagless shirts as advertised, still ""Lofteez T"" but some colors come with tags.Good quality shirts, the sizing is dead on, but this color IS NOT TAGLESS AS ADVERTISED!!1"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,PURCHASED THESE T-SHIRTS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE TAGLESS. THEY WERE NOT. AND THAT WAS AFTER WAITING ALMOST 2 WEEKS TO GET THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I HAD TO PAY $11 TO PAY FOR IT TO GET SHIPPED BACK AND IM STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND AFTER 2 MORE WEEKS. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE TAGGED SHIRTS AND DONT NEED THEM RIGHT AWAY!
3,Check-Out Problem,"The only reason I didn't buy these is because they all showed up exactly the same in my check-out cart even though I had ordered different colors. I continued through each step looking for some confirmation of the size and color before I finalized the order but it never showed anything other than the brand name and a photo of a yellow shirt. Since I have always been able to confirm the correct size and color upon checkout when purchasing other items, and this one did not provide that, I didn't want to chance receiving the wrong item. This bug in the system leaves too much room for error so I opted not to buy."
1,Never Recieved,Sorry but I got never got the Merchandise ordered. I need to call and speek to someone at the company
4,Good quick read,This was a quick interesting read that covers the major Greek mythological stories in an easy to understand format. Great for children and adults
4,Nice,"Nicely written, and easy to read. Useful for beginners interested in folk tales from ancient cultures or ancient Greek beliefs"
2,not what i expected,not what i have read in comparison to other greek mythology. easy to read language but not too interesting. i'd like to qualify that i read a lot of mythology from all over the world and have greatly enjoyed greek mythology in the past. this just didn't do it for me.
1,None,This is clearly roman names and i asked for greek mythology and zeus ploted revenge because cronus ate his children but his wife tricked cronus into eating a rock instead of zeus.
3,"Well told tales: Great intro to classical myths, but...","This is written as children's book, but makes a great light page turner for adults. Nice short little chapters make it great for commuters. The ""but"" is that for some reason the author tells the Greek Stories with the Roman characters of the gods -Jupiter instead of Zeus, Diana instead of Artemis, etc. This does not undermine the enjoyment of the stories, which are really delightfully simple and fun, rather the accuracy."
4,Mythology for kids,"This is a book of Greek mythology which I assumed would be for adults, but it's obviously for kids. It has stories of Jupiter, Venus, Juno and other gods, and familiar tales like Prometheus giving fire to humans, Medusa and Perseus, Atalanta and the apples, and more. I deliberately and happily know nothing about kids, so I have no idea what age group the book is appropriate for."
3,Old Greek Stories,"I have always been interested in Greek mythology, I found some of the stories new to me while others I was aware of"
4,Good instructional information,"If you watch Garcia's introductions to the exercises, you gain a lot more than if you dive right in to doing them. She goes through the actual exercises fairly rapidly and without any instruction or tips. There are a large variety of workouts to pick from both in fitness levels (3) and multipe time lengths. If I have 25 minutes, I can do the long one; when I'm pressed for time I do the 8 minute one. My only reason for not rating this a 5 is that she is totally without emotion or enthusiasm for Pilates. You have to be intrigued by Pilates before you do this workout or you might get dismayed by her lack of energy! Jennifer Kries (The Method) has combined her workouts with yoga, which changes the flavor of Pilates, but she has a smiling, happy approach, which I enjoy."
5,Good Instruction & Usability,"I've been collecting workout videos for years and they all fall short in the same place - once you learn the routine you waste time with the instructor teaching and demonstrating each move as she leads you through the routine. This program is different. You learn all the moves in the ""learning"" sections at the beginning of each level. I started just doing the intermediate routines, but have gone back to learn the moves. I love that I get to do a routine all the way through without having to fast forward between each move while it's explained and demonstrated! The workouts move a good pace for if you're new to Pilates."
4,Great for learning all the Pilates basics!,"When I wanted to start Pilates, I wanted a DVD that would combine beginners workouts with more advanced moves. This DVD is perfect for no matter what level you are at, and allows you to progress at your own pace. I workout all the time, and I use this as a supplement to my normal work out. It's really good for toning your core, as all Pilates workouts are. While the music and the voiceovers are annoying at times, this is a GREAT bargain, and you learn all the Pilates basics!!"
2,a total waste of money,"I bought this DVD because it has such great reviews. But as I found out after having it for only one week that it was the biggest waste of time and money. If you have never taken a Pilates class before, and have no idea what it is supposed to be this DVD might be something you would like. In the end though you would be wasting your time, effort, and money on something that is poor quality and poor pilates! (...) It also states that there are workouts for the ""less flexible people"" and that is completely false, they do not alter the routine one bit from the original ""more complex"" routine."
2,Bored out of my Mind!,When I got this video I was ready to start toning up with pilates. When I watched how boring and bland the instruction was I had second thoughts. I want to get a good Pilates workout but without the yawning and sleepiness. The next Pilates video I get will have more pep in it's step than this one.
2,Didn't work,"This would have been a great DVD if it didn't freeze up after the workout was done, or if all of the workouts would play on my DVD. The company that makes this DVD said some players don't run these DVD's well, mine must be one of them."
1,Not a motivational workout,"This was my first Pilates video and I am not sure if I will buy another one if they are all like this. The background looks like a plain background from grade school pictures from the 70's. There was no motivation at all with this. Her voice is really boring and very annoying when she is counting each breath on ""The One Hundred"". I tried to zone her out but no luck. The instruction is good if you can stay awake to listen to it. If you need motivation, I don't think this will do it for you. And I agree with the others, that there are not 35 different work outs on this DVD. It is just the same work outs in different sections of the DVD. It reminded me of copying and pasting with a computer, i.e. copying & pasting the same work outs into the intermediate and advanced sections."
1,"No, no no!","Having taken lots of Pilates classes, I'm here to tell you this dvd isn't very good. Some of the exercise cycles are incomplete (Garcia does right leg series, but skips left, that sort of thing), preparatory instructions are sometimes unclear, and reminders as to inhalation and exhalation are scant. This might seem petty, but certain poses just fall into place when your breathing is right, and this dvd won't help with that. If you're new to Pilates, buy something else. If you're experienced, don't buy this unless you have a remote handy at all times to stop the dvd and complete a cycle of reps, or unless you're so experienced you don't need breathing reminders."
5,"Real pilates, very good","I really like this DVD. Most of the other Pilates DVDs available are just the popular fitness divas who decided to jump on a bandwagon and BASE a workout on Pilates. This is really a certified instructor and a real Pilates program. I don't need fancy sets and snazzy music, I need a qualified instructor who will show me the proper way to do the exercises and not hurt myself. This DVD promises to be very versatile and will be good for me as I progress in strength and flexibility."
2,Disappointed,"I've been doing Pilates for years, and I was hoping to get a DVD with some variety to change up my regular routine when I purchased this DVD. But when I popped it in my DVD player and selected the intermediate workout, I was surprised to find that the movements were way too fast than what other instructors teach. I thought Pilates was supposed to use slow, precise movements in order to tone the muscle groups. Another aspect of the video that was a letdown is the fact that this is the most boring thing you've ever seen! It shows the same woman all the way through going through the motions and another woman doing a voice-over or narrarating the movements and counting. There is no personal interaction or instruction whatsoever. I definitely would not recommend this for a beginner or any Pilates level, for that matter."
2,Good Excercises - Little Explanation,"I'm very new to Pilates and bought this product because it said that it ranges from beginner through advanced and I thought I'd be able to grow with it as I progressed. I thought the exercises were good, but the DVD gave very little background information and didn't outline how to build a good routine. I thought the environment is very boring. It did not get me too excited as I started along the path to a good workout. I'm going to look for a product that has more information on the aspects behind Pilates as well as a more dynamic environment to make the training a bit more exciting."
2,Uninspiring and disapointing,"This workout is advertised as having workouts for beginners through advanced. This is partly true, except that all the workouts are basically the same both in sequence and movements. Some of the advanced workouts include some additional movements, but this was a big disapointment.The second problem with the dvd is that there is a second or two of black screen between the movements which is disconcerting because it interrupts the flow. This means that sometimes you will be scambling to get into the correct position to start the next movement.The third problem is that there is not enough instruction on correct form for a beginner. The fourth, and biggest problem is that overall this video is uninspiring.On a positive note, I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this really is a good example of classic Pilates which can be hard to find these days."
4,Very Funny,Extraordinary! non stop laughing if you enjoy french humor. Both Jean Paul Belmondo and Jaqueline Biset are wonderful. This movie inspired the 70's parodies.
2,Freely available online,"While I commend the publisher for putting all of these works together in an electronic format, note that you can get the same materials online for free by going to the 9-11 Commission's website: http://www.9-11commission.gov."
3,A good collection,"Finch, also a fine poet, has assembled a book that is a large, useful survey of issues arising from the New Formalist poetry movement. A few of the essays are of lesser quality, but most are strong engagements with the diverse varieties of traditional form in contemporary American poetry. As Finch notes, it may be time to move past the label ""New Formalist"" in considering the larger influence of the resurgence of tradtional form--a viewpoint I support. The book overall is a provoking collection, and a good introduction to the issues surrounding contemporary poetry in traditional form."
3,Forget Somebody?,"Although I understand that it must have been very diffiult to decide which pianists got put in the collection, let alone a two-disc sampler, I still feel that any anthology of the piano (other than one highlighting the romantic era)should contain at least one piece by Gould, yet this one doesn't. Gould has been almost unanimously hailed as one of the most influential artist of the twentieth century, yet he is not included on this disc. Other than that, a great buy."
3,Old edition - Expanded significantly in Fourth Edition,Tests in Print - is the standard for finding out about available tests that can be administrated to children and adults. This book was only one volume in the Third edition and was greatly expanded to a two volume set in later editions.
3,"RUSTED, chipped paiint and missing mounting botls","It arrived unwrapped, no box, just the shipping label, and chipped paint. There were rusted areas on it. I requested a 2nd one and same thing, now been 4 weeks and Amazon has not I still have the 2nd one, and no credit back yet. My conclusion is this item is used and should NOT be priced as new. The description should clearly state it is used.ZERO star if I can give that!"
1,BULLLL!!!,This will be the first time i will ever have to write a bad review i hope. First off ok yea like the other reviews said it came bubble wrapped ..ok i dont mind that. This thing looked way different then what the picture showed. Second this thing did not fit on my 2002 toyota tacoma i had to ghetto rig it to fit. i will never purchase from here again. i hope this helps other ppl with their next purchase.
2,not heavy duty,"This is a large very attractive ""tool"" box. However, it is produced in materials that are not adequate for carrying actual tools. The top and drawers are hard brittle plastic, the kind that will shatter if impacted by something hard. Also the drawer slides are not heavy duty enough to slide with a drawer full of heavy wrenches. This would be a nice box for light weight craft items, sewing, etc., but not for mechanics tools."
5,Great Item!!!!!!!!,"This is worth the money and more. If you're looking for something that will help you take photos for the net this is it. With this and and a little editing the pictures look great. I don't use the backdrops that came with it, instead I use a large piece of white craft paper (thicker than regular paper). It's glossy on one side and matte on the other. I also use different color tiles to set my items on. I went to Home Depot and purchased one of their $8.00 aluminum utility clip light to set on the top since on occasion I want the light from the top. Such a small price for something that works so well."
4,A great deal!,"It was easy to assemble, the lights are good and don't get too hot. The quality of my pictures has improved 100%."
3,Not quite their greatest hits.,"This cd is worth getting just for ""What's New Pussycat"".Great song.""Green Green Grass of Home"", ""Thunderball"", and ""Promise Her Anything"" are also marvelous contributions from Mr. Jones. He is one of the few artists that can pull off such a wide variety of material and yet, make them all uniquely his ""Sound"". Englebert has some good moments too, but how in the world do they leave off ""Bicyclettes De Belsize"", and ""After the Lovin'""? Who compiles these albums? Oh well, all in all not a bad disc."
4,"Noisy, thrashy, trashy Metal...gotta love it","I loved Raven as a teenager in 1983 when I got the ""All For One"" album. This is a great, loud, live album without a hint of subtlety, just as powerful as stablemates like Venom without all the silly Satanic dreck."
3,"Good , but not ""le meilleur""","This is a reasonably good bilingual dictionary which will be of great use to high school or college students until they get into reading really heavy duty French literature (particularly anything modern) or trying to translate really fine points. At such a time, a larger dictionary will provide more nuance and help find just the right word for the job.What differentiates the Larousse from other similarly-hefty French-English dictionaries is, I find, a somewhat classical--even old-fashioned view of how both French and English are spoken and written.So, depending on how advanced your French is and whether you're dealing with cutting-edge French or something a bit more classical, this just might be the dictionary that your bookshelf has been waiting for. (Ed, sorry 'bout the dangling prep)."
2,No Noticeable Fragrance,"Gets the laundry clean but no noticeable fragrance. Related ""lavender fragranced fabric rinse"" by the same maker is a much better product."
5,Very Safe Wash,"I love this stuff, it makes my sheets smell nice and I feel safe using it on my 800 thread count sheets. It doesn't make them smell too strong - not overwhelming, just right. The linen place where I bought the sheets recommended Sweet Sheets as being very safe for fine linens and I find it so."
3,OK for low carbers...,"The author does a good job with the ice cream recipes in this book but I was hoping for a better selection of cookies, pies, and other types of desserts to bake the low carb way. I do recommend this book for those looking for low carb ice cream recipes, BUT if you're like me and love pies, cookies, cakes then I have to recommend hands-down, Eat Yourself Thin With Fabulous Desserts."
5,Great for Low Carb Diet,"I liked the variety of flavors of this ice cream and the rich flavor. Compared to store ice cream it had less air and more substance and also no sugar alcohols which I really liked! I find that sugar alcohols can cause some unplesant side effects.Over the holidays, I enjoyed making the yummy, sweet after dinner drinks with this ice cream. I was missing my Brandy Alexanders."
2,one basic recipe,"I was disappointed in this book -- it was formulaic, with every recipe including a brand-name of gelatin, dried egg-white protein, and liquid sweetener. There is some suggestion on how to substitute these two products, but not enough detail to get the reader headed in the right direction. More alternative basic recipes, or more detailed explanations of substitutions, would have been helpful.She could have printed one basic recipe, and made a matrix of additions with adjustments, in one or two pages.Author also relies heavily on use of flavor extracts, instead of natural or whole ingredients. (I understand this can lower carbs, but).Unfortunately this book is worthless to me."
3,"OK, but not much more than ice cream","This book was OK, but there wasn't much more in it than many different types of ice cream -- don't be misled by the ""Desserts"" or ""Baking"" part of the title. I made the Peanut butter chocolate ice cream and it was mediocre, and I haven't tried any since."
3,Okay! For Hard Ganster Rap Fans,I can only say that the best thing about this low budget video movie was the contribution of George Cotayo for his very good work as director of photography. The acting was very poor accept for the one who plays Cash. I like the music soundtrack.
2,The box is the best part,"This movie was really bad. The photography was terrible, the dialogue (when you could understand it) was moronic and uninspired, and the acting...well it's hard to find an adjective that truly captures how bad the acting was. The words ""take two"" obviously never found their way onto the set. The first half hour was ok for a couple of laughs (at how bad and goofy it was), but it was all downhill from there. There isn't a student filmmaker alive that couldn't put this movie to shame. I thought the box was cool though (hence the two stars instead of one). It had better lines on it than the ones in the film. So unless you love the box as I do, go buy something good like Scarface. Now that's a movie about a big baller."
1,Not worth buying!!!!!!!!,"This movie was horrible. You guys are talking about MP having bad acting in his movies, well wait till you see this one."
2,Not what I wanted,"I pull a 5th wheel and wanted to take off my tailgate and replace it with a cargo net. This one looked like what I needed. However when I got it the instructions said not for holding cargo. Duh, what is a cargo net for, good looks! That is all this one qualifies for as it won't hold anything in your bed. I was very unhappy with it and would not reocmmend it to any one who wants to keep anything in their truck bed."
1,Kinda junk,"Well the scews are NOT self-taping. Its too wide 2 tighten up and it stretches, so you've been warned. but its cheap so theres that................................................................."
1,Hardware is terrible,"The hardware that comes with this net is terrible and would NOT self-tap, no matter what I did. All screws either stripped out, broke off, or were worthless."
1,Don't waste your money or time!!,With a name like Bully you would expect it to be strong and capable. Nope!! it is weak and lacks the sort of utility that you would expect a CARGO NET is made for. It actulay has a tag sewn on to it that states that it is not intended to hold cargo.WTF????One swift pull on this thing and I was able to remove it from the back of my truck without undoing any of the straps. Every single strap came undone where it was sewn to the net rendering this thing totaly useless.Don't waste your money.......
2,maybe just not for me,"I have yet to find a knife price guide comparable to the bluebook for firearms. This is more of the same. No prices for contemporary makers like Benchmade or Spyderco. Very few fixed blades. There is one picture of some Blanchard Spydeys but no mention of price. I have bought several knife price guides, none have been helpful to me."
4,well distilled ideas presented less skillfully,I believe the thesis and facts because the author is so evidently a straight shooter. This book is my introduction to the North/South Korea topic and I'm sure will serve as a very solid cornerstone.
4,Pollini the Virtuoso,"Maurizio Pollini is best known for his performances of Chopin. The next volume in the series is actually also dedicated to Pollini as well and exclusively contains Chopin works. This volume shows Pollini's ability to play multiple composers works from Romantic period of Schubert, Schumann and Liszt to the more modern composers of Stravinsky and Debussy. The Schumann Sonata, Schubert Klavierstucke and Debussy etude excerpts are fantastic. For the Liszt Sonata I prefer performances by Vladimir Horowitz or Claudio Arrau, and the Petrouchka suite I find more suited in the hands of Emil Gilels. Maurizio Pollini though is one of the Great Pianists of the 20th Century and is worthy of 2 volumes dedicated to him. Fans of him shouldn't hesitate to pick up the next volume, as well as any of his many recordings for DG."
3,Origianl version,"Same great cast, same grainy picture. This DVD has not been re-mastered, consequently the picture suffers. If you're ok with the old movies you saw as a kid, this is a classic. If you prefer your classics with crisp picture and sound, wait for a better version."
2,Creaky,"Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going."
2,FINE HISTORIC RENDITION,"Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards. An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered. A good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research."
4,good old movie,This is a really old movie but if you are a King Henry Vlll bluff you will like it. Charles Laughton makes a wonderful King Henry Vlll. I love all of the Charles Laughton King Henry movie and this one is great. For all King Henry Vlll fans. Worth buying.
5,"Dry reading, but amazingingly detailed information","First of all, the reader needs to keep in mind that this is an official military document; it is factual not entertaining. I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in Holocaust history in any way, whether is it your profession or hobby.Even though it is a government report, it is nevertheless moving and at time gut-wrenching in the matter of fact details of what the United States Army found at Concentration Camp Dachau, in Germany at the end of the European War."
4,commentary and sermons from the Psalms,Warren Wiersbe does his usual fine job in this book on Psalms chapters 90-150. The book arrived on time as ordered.
3,Holes too big,"I have a sonata 2 case. My fan went out and i replaced it with the same brand fan. I had to drill my case for the screws to fit. good fan, disappointed that it didn't fit by default"
2,Re: Good Compilation,"""The Exorcist: The Version You Have Never Seen"" - Still the scariest movie on my list. ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"" - Useless sequel that adds nothing to the franchise. ""The Exorcist III"" - A sequel by name but a small connection to the original film. What are missing are the subtitles. ""The Exorcist: The Beginning"" - Renny Harlin's rescue to Paul Schrader""s ""Dominion - Prequel to the Exorcist"" is my preference; it is a more commercialized update than the stylish latter."
5,The Exorcist trillagy,yes this is one of my all time favorit movie collection yes also the most fear full one to as kid i would never watch this movie alone i watch it know and respect it thats all movie its great a must have to a true movie colector
4,it doesn't have subtitles in spanish,"in the item description it tells that all the movies have subtitles in spanish,english,etc and is not true:the exorcist:the vision you've never seen and the exorcist III, don't have subtitles in spanish"
3,Just buy the The Version You've Never Seen!,The originial is the best and now a new version has add to it! the other movies in this set are not even close! So only buy The Version You've Never Seen and you wont be disappointed!
1,Why?,"I won't waste your time with any reviews of The Exorcist movies. We all know what The Exorcist is, otherwise, we wouldn't be reading this page.My main problem with this boxset is this: the only two films in this box worth owning are the original (or the ""Version You've Never Seen"", whichever you prefer) and The Exorcist III, both of which you can get for $5.50 or less at Wal-Mart. Why pay almost $20 extra for three other movies that aren't worth watching, and you're more than likely never going to watch?Spring the $11 for the two Exorcist movies that matter, and go out to eat with the other $20. Thank me later."
1,"Bought it today, going back tomorrow","This ""review"" is for the Diamond Multimedia PVR550PCI Xtremetv Pvr Hardware Tv Tuner. More like a rant I suppose.This product is Absolute Garbage, card captures jerky, software is junk, I can't take this thing back fast enough.I've never taken the time to review anything but if I can stop someone else from making a mistake it is worth it.I have 2 drives mutli partitions, there's no way to redirect video files to another drive. Everything's hidden, no adjustment. the software is TRIAL version! It gives you serial numbers, but it doesnt do anything it still says you have x days subscription. This card is billed, sold, PRICED as a ""premium card"", on par with Hauppauge etc, it is NOT.Tomorrow I am taking this back and getting the hauppauge like I should have...The so called ""media server"" where you can view the tv remotely is an ADD ON PURCHASE."
2,Poor reproduction,"I bought these to replace the standard iPod and Sony ear buds. I was under the impression that I would get a much deeper bass response. I was wrong. The bass reproduction is simply horrid. I read somewhere there is a ""break-in"" period. I have found this not to be true. They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new. This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed. I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more. My recommendation is to keep researching."
3,"Ouch, these earphones hurt","Pros: Good sound. Like the way they limit external noise-not too much, not too litte. Very good outdoors. The color coordinates with my Zen Vision M, nice touch. They collapse easily, store nicely in the case provided.Cons so far: Won't stay on my head should I bend to pick something up. My ears ache after 4-5 hours of listening. The cord is about 12"" longer than needed.I've used the earphones about 2 months. I use them to listen to audible books (8-9, so far) while performing repetitive tasks involved in handweaving, walking the dog, etc. I have not used them to listen to music."
3,Great sound quality,"Great sound quality, however, I don't find them very comfortable. Hard to beat for the price sound quality wise, however I wouldn't recommend these due to uncomfortable fit after an hour or so of usage."
3,Way too fragile for everyday use,I was enjoying the headphones on my business trip for a few weeks. Then after a couple of months I tried them again and some plastic parts on both the right and left headphones got broken almost at the same time. After a little research I found out that it's not worth while sending them to get the warranty repair money-wise. So I used some tape to fix them as the they sound really quite well.My understanding is that these headphones could be good for traveling but they are too fragile for everyday use.
5,Great Headphones,"First set of headphones I have owned that actually have me reaching for them. I bought these headphones for my wife, when I got her an iPod. Since she cannot tolerate earbuds. The sound on these headphones is wonderfull, super clean and very deep. The headphones themselves are very light and comfotable to wear, she is always using them at the gym with no problems. Considering the market, I think these are an affordable solution to most peoples needs, If your not a DJ or a Studio Tech, these should work just fine. They are very resiliant and fold in a case when your done."
3,PX 200W not for air travel,"For every day use these are very good. Good sound quality, fairly good bass response and light weight.Our trip to Europe included these for iPod use. I cannot recommend these for air travel as the engine noise wiped out all of the high frequencies and greatly diminshed the overall enjoyment. Possibly the NC version would be better served."
4,Sennheiser Fan,"I had my first set of open air white plastic Sennheiser headphones in the early seventies; would run the 150' cable from the stereo down to the beach and listen to Cat Stevens, et al, for hours. Now, in the day of the mp3 and xm player, I have a pair of basic Sennheiser ear buds with a convenient volume control slide. I purchased these PX200W phones simply to see if I could get a little more 'oomph!' in the playback. I'm pleased with these phones, like the white finish, and, as another reviewer commented, 'as soon as you figure out how to wrap them up in the convenient carrying case without destroying them...' you are home-free. I'm a dedicated Sennheiser fan, and use these new phones as an alternate to the very convenient buds."
2,Too fragile,"I've had the PX200s for just 3 months, and the right wing just snapped, dropping the earphone out of the adjustable holder.I've loved these headphone; they deliver excellent sound and provide a tight fit to minimize outside sound interference. I very much enjoyed the fold-up feature, exercising care w/ the folding and placing into the provided bag for carrying. I'm not hard on these things or careless in their care. Upon investigation, I learned that the cost of repair/replacement from Sennheiser is nearly equal to the cost of a new set. I'm disappointed because the sound is really good. Duct tape to the rescue."
5,Nice headphones for the price,IMHO the sound quality provided by these headphones is excellent. They collapse down very easilty and can be stored/re-stored in the really cool case that they come in. They seem to be well made and are adjustable and very comfortable.
3,Why pay more for less?,"I've enjoyed the PX 200s for several days. They are quite wearable and comfortable on a large head. If I hadn't tried the PX 100s, I might be content to keep them. But despite the open design of the 100s, they bring the bottom end of the music into the balanced picture. The 200s suggest the existence of bass, the 100s let you feel it. It's not just a question of a poor ear seal with the 200s, as I don't feel the same bass when I press them tightly to my ears. The 200s do provide more acoustic isolation, if you would prefer that to the entire musical spectrum."
3,Where's the bass?,"These are certainly not bad portable headphones. They create a pretty decent stereo soundstage with some remarkable depth.However, there are a few cons:1) Bass response is pretty much non-existent. It seems like the cutoff is at about 100Hz, though I'm sure they're ""rated"" at better. Results in a pretty flat sound.2) Due to the limited range, more complex and heavy music (i.e. rock, metal, etc.) tends to sound pretty muddy.3) As another reviewer mentioned, these the PX 200s really hurt the ears after they have been on for about an hour."
1,I can hear again,"I have two sennheiser products - one a wireless headset connected to my home theater and the PX200W headset that i use with a sansa MP# player. I know i have high frequency loss in both ears, but these instruments help me enjoy what I thought was lost. Great phones!"
4,Great Value,"I purchased these headphones about one month ago and have been very pleased with my purchase. The build quality is very high and the included case is actually very easy to use (it usually takes me 10-20 seconds to fully encase them). The sound quality however is not amazing but it is good compared to a 20 dollar pair of earbuds. The ear cup does a good job of isolating outside noises, better than I would have originally expected. I am not by any shot an audiophile but these are definatelly a great buy for 50 dollars."
3,Lady Meli'sa Is Back,"I like ""I Remember."" Man it's been over ten years sinceshe's put out an album and she still sounds great with thatsmoky full-bodied voice and plenty of lyrical sass to boot.My favorite tracks are the title track, ""Will You"", ""FeelMe"" and ""He's The One"". All the little interludes of classicsongs sung just to a piano were nice, however, it would havebeen nice had she just grouped them altogether in one medley.While everything lyrically was very distinctive, some of themelodies didn't move me like ""Let's Be Real"" or ""Do You StillLove Me."" I hope this album really puts our soul chanteuseback on top of the charts where she really deserves to be."
3,I've heard better from Meli'sa!,"Being a true Meli'sa morgan fan and having all of her previous albums, I bough this one on pure impulse. Knowing who she was and liking all of her eariler works, I though that this one would be just as good. Sad to say that it is not. I don't like nor do i appreciate ANY of the remakes on this album with the exception of the interlude where she does a piece of the Rufus classic 'pack'd my bags.' Other than that the other remakes she should have left alone and stuck to her own material. the best songs on here to me are the title track and never let you go, which are written in true Meli'sa form. Other songs that are great are will you, and high maintence. I appreciate the album because of my love for the artists and i appreciate her still puttin out albums for the true fans, but next time hopefully, she will do better. I know that she has it in her!"
4,"comfy, 'okay' extra pair at the right price","I like these okay...I was surprised they look a little cheap for easy spirit, yet they are only like $19.50! (On other sites I saw these exact same shoes for $64.00)They look nice with slacks and I am all about comfort! They succeed on that score. I'd buy them again. A simple black slide that goes with almost anything."
3,About average,"They look comfy. They flop though, making a loud noise when the heel hits the floor when I'm walking. I'll have to wear socks with them because they must run wider than a ""B"" width. But they do look comfy!"
5,Another great book by Jewel...,"What else is there to say? She is an amazing and honest writer... some people who might not understand poetry might give this less than 4 stars... I won't mention names but if you scroll down this list of reviews you might see. Fools both. =) If you like Jewel you'll love this book. (Also see, ""A night without armor"")"
1,not a good book,"Jewel yet again gives both disappointment and disgust to any and all with taste in literature in this horrible book. The trite, cliche phraseology is to be expected after her first piece of garbage, but in novel form it is a good deal more pungeunt. On the plus side, however, she is hot."
4,Wonderfully intimate...,"When I purchased the video ""Jewel: A Life Uncommon,"" I was disappointed. However, I found what I was searching for in her book ""Chasing Down the Dawn.""This book is wonderful. Jewel demonstrates her talent for writing prose with astute observations and beautiful language. She is truly a talented writer. Part of what makes her so talented is that you can actually feel her emotions rising off the page--she writes of her childhood, the painful loss of her best friend, her relationships with both her mother and her father, and some of her family history. It is fascinating and could be fiction just as easily as nonfiction. She has truly led a unique life.Supplementing the writings of Jewel are great photographs of her and her friends, and of her when she was younger and of places she has been. I found this to be a great addition to her writing.This is a mandatory item for any Jewel fan--it will give you more insight into who she is and what she does and it is truly interesting."
5,worth the trip,"I found the book to be inspiring even for a man. Jewel chases her dream to stardom, not to be famous but to do what she loves, sing and write. I really enjoyed little bits about the spirt tour insights. My best friend played drums on the tour and I really feel like she explains in detail so well that you will honestly find yourself right there with her. Not a bad book for a rock star."
4,Jewel Kilcher - Chasing Down The Dawn...,"Not Many Of Today's Musicians Write Lyrics That Speak To You In A Way That Expresses Their Most Intimiate Thoughts...Jewel Kilcher Is Certainly One Of Them...In This, Her Second Book, Jewel Writes Not Poetic Tales Of Her View Of The Wwrld, But Childhood Stories That Speak To Us Deeply, And Without Any Interference...Her Tales Seem To Capture The Reader With Utmost Charm And Charisma Which Attracts From The Heart...A Must Read Book For Any Jewel Kilcher Fan..."
3,"""Lions and tigers and bears oh my!""","This book was an easy read. It's more of a memoir than anything else. Fans of Jewel will probably adore it. I picked it up because Jewel reminds me of a friend I once had. Reading about the various people the author has met and some of her experiences over the years, I was reminded of a lot of other people I have met and places I have been. There isn't anything spectacular here, but it is an interesting book."

3,Decent Info For It's Time,"Basically this is good for getting started with ebay,but considering how much ebay has changed since the late 90's this book could use an updated version. Also,from my experiance using garage sales as an source for products can be more difficult than what was said in this book. The problem with buying from garage sales is that for the most part you won't know what the results will be for the various items you see. Even if you try to only buy items that you've seen do well on ebay you might not even find these items at most garage sales. So I don't recommend garage sales as a primary source for ebay products. I've bought alot of non-profitable junk at garage sales."
5,Will Last for a Life Time,"Vows was the first book I read of Ms. Alers. I founded the cover interesting because the gentlemen appeared caucasian. So I'm thinking an interracial love story. OK. But once you start reading you find that he is part African Amerian & Cuban American. But the color thing isn't as significant as the suspense, mystery and the love that these two are destined to have. I have read other books of Ms. Alers but Vows is the one I have read and re-read several times. This is an Excellent book and I would enjoy seeing this turn into a move for BET."
5,The Best!!!!!!!!!!,The Hideaway series is the best to truly enjoy it you must read all of them you will love them I promise!
3,Prefer interval training,"This isn't a bad workout, but it lacks a good cardio workout. If you're just looking for strength training, this is an okay video. I don't feel an incredible workout with it though. I use it on my lighter days when I'm not feeling too great but still want to work out."
5,Great Workout,"This workout has been great for me. I love the customizable workouts, and the instructor is friendly without being too cheesy. I would suggest buying a set of hand weights to use because several of the workout sets use them, but that is only a recommendation, they are not necessary to have a good workout with this video. Overall, definitely one of the best workout videos I've used."
4,Surprising!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It takes a lot for workout DVDs to impress me since I have been through so many and I thought it was just going to be another typical workout DVD: bicep curls, lunges, etc. It wasn't!The workout is split up into sections: warm-up, cardio, upper body weights, lower body weights, abs, and cool down. The lower body is the section I was most surprised with. It took classical exercises (lunges, squats, and piles), and applied them in a ""new"" ways. AND my heart rate went way up in this section, which is always good.The upper body section is similar--doing classical exercises but in new combinations--but not quite as innovative (though still a workout!)I only gave 4 starts because I didn't find the Abs section very challenging, but it wasn't THAT bad."
3,A solid workout,"This workout is not for those of you who want a ""hard core"" workout. It is a good workout but gets monotonous after awhile. It fulfills it's promise of getting you in shape for a particular event. I think you might get bored if you use it too long after your event has passed (BTW, not just for weddings!). What I like best is that you can arrange the workouts in the order that you prefer them. It's also set up so you can get quick workouts if necessary. Overall, a good workout DVD and fairly priced. I would recommend it for beginners or intermediates looking to get in shape quickly."
3,For beginners only,"This is a good dvd in that it has mix and match workouts and schedule suggestions. As someone in reasonable shape to start, I found this dvd to be relatively easy and not very challenging. It probably would get monotonous after awhile, but the instructor is good and clear, explains things well and the video moves along. I think this would be best for a very beginner. I was left feeling like I didn't get a great workout. And the blonde's incessant smile is a little annoying, lol. Good luck!"
4,Exactly what I expected,"I just got this DVD did the whole video last night! I bought it because my sister is getting married and I'm wearing a body hugging strapless dress!! YIKES!! After reading everyone's reviews I was really excited! Like many mentioned, the cardio workout is weak. But I have other workouts for cardio. Try Tae Bo or Abs Diet 2 workout for cardio more challenging. I really like the different lifting excercises for upper body. She doesn't do just the typical curls, pushups (although, those are included). And my upper body is sore today even though I dropped down to my 5 pound weights! I've been using 8 pounds with my other DVDs. Also, the ab routine is great!! About 80% of the ab/core workout is standing and yes my abs are sore today!! Well worth the $$!"
4,Good quick workout,"I ordered this DVD as most people do to tone up for my upcoming wedding. Most of the segments are 20-30 minutes, great for when you are short on time but still want to get a workout in. You can also select which chapters you want to use for a custom designed workout which is great. You do need some light weights in order to do the workouts properly... I have been using books instead of real weights! Will probably get sick of it after a few months but I think that happens with all workout DVD's!"
3,Squandered opportunity,"What a wasted gimmick. This could be any other basic workout, except for the customizable-by-wedding-dress-type menu. Not enough bridal extravaganza campiness -- not any! Which means people are buying this workout for real and treating it very very seriously, when they could also be purchasing any other workout and treating it very very seriously to get fit for the big day. I've got some ideas for improvement in my full review here: [...]"
5,A must buy,"The price is amazing and it is a good workout. I highly suggest anyone interested in getting in shape for a special occasion buy this dvd. I also own the Brazilian Butt lift workout and I find a lot of the moves on this dvd similar, although the Butt lift workout is more intense."
3,Ok....,"I was actually a little disappointed with this workout - I guess I was expecting more cardio. But for sculpting, it's great. I also like the fact that you can customize the segments to suit your goals. If you are looking for immediate, significant weight loss, I'm not sure this is the right video. After I lose some weight, it will probably be great for maintenance and sculpting!"
4,Nice easy to follow workout,I love this workout. Would have given it 5 stars if it was a bit more challenging. Still a good workout and easy to stick to.
3,"Melissa and Doug, nice idea","This toy bought from Amazon, was sturdy enough, problem was you are suppose to do magic tricks, but we couldn't figure out some of them because there are no instructions"
3,great set but littel replay value,"I bought this set for my son's 8th birthday. He opened it the day before the party and played most of the trick for his friends at the party. It was easy to play and lots of fun. However, he has not touched it since. I doubt he will use it again. But he did understand the tricks, which fooled most of the grown ups at the party."
5,A perfect gift!,My six-year old daughter has been completely captivated by this magic set. She's had so much fun putting on shows for family members and hasn't needed too much help in figuring out how to successfully perform the tricks. Even my three year old has enjoyed being part of the act! A very well made set with good instructions. I only wish a lock had been added to the box so that all the pieces could be stored safely inside. We slip ours into a child-sized pillowcase to contain everything. We love the creative performances the magic set has inspired and the fun it has provided for our girls. This is my new favorite birthday gift for this age group!
5,Favorite Birthday Present,"My daughter got this set, along with many Harry-Potter-ish items (wand, robe, books) for her 9th birthday - and she and her six year old brother have been showing us magic tricks ever since. She LOVES it, and he loves it (and even our two year old loves to show the disappearing ball trick, though he amazes himself most of all)... it's a really fun set for them - sturdy and nice, they read the instructions and worked out how to do the tricks themselves, so they could come put on (several) magic show(s) for the rest of us."
4,Grandpa's Gift is a Hit,"My dad gave this magic set to my eight-year-old for Christmas, and she likes it a great deal. Although my five-year-old was not gifted with this, she is often playing with it. I am also having a lot of fun learning the tricks and teaching my girls how to successfully perform them with some flair. They have really enjoyed puzzling family members with these simple illusions. I like how many of the pieces are made of wood, are colorful, and come in a carrying case. The set could be improved if there was a latch and handle on the case. I am also not the biggest fan of some of the pictures, but these are minor criticisms. This was a great gift that I see my girls getting out on occasion to entertain friends."
4,Great set!,I got this for my 7 year old. It's amazingly well made as most Melissa and Doug products seem to be. He can do most of the tricks but I had to read the instructions first and figure out the tricks and then teach him. He would have never been able to do that alone. He is reading but not to that complicated level.
4,Nice quality and fun for 8yr old,I have purchased other Melissa & Doug toys in the past and this magic set is of similar nice quality. I like that the set is made out of wood and fabric (versus cheap plastic). Even the container/box is nice. I bought for my 8yr old son and he is having fun with it. He has to work on the tricks a bit to get them down -- and he is willing to do that. I believe the toy is rated for 8+ year olds and I think that is correct.
5,the most played with gift,"I bought this set for my 8 year old daughter. She had expressed a desire for such and had circled many cheap versions in toy catalogs for Christmas. After researching many kits, reading advice to buy or not to buy kits, I chose this Melissa and Doug Deluxe Magic set. It is just beautiful! It was one of the most played with items during all of Christmas week. Not just for her but for her 5 siblings as well... all older than her btw. The instructions were easy for her to follow on all but one trick. After gentle prompting from an older brother, she got it. We all enjoy her ""shows"". I am more than pleased with this purchase."
5,Amazing tricks!,"My grandson, aged 8, just loved this set. He learned a couple of illusion tricks the first day and he had me fooled. It packs nicely into a small space for ease of moving around. Items were of good quality which should last a long time."
2,disappointed,I was really disappointed in this product after the great reviews I had read. It was way too difficult for my 9 year old to figure out most of the tricks. Even I had a hard time with some. He tired of it quickly and will probably remain on the shelf.
2,Not that fun,I bought this for a 9yr old boy thinking it would be fun due to all the positive reviews. It was the most boring magic set I've ever seen. The tricks are silly. I think he played with it out of obligation but has never touched it again. Melissa and Doug usually make great toys but I think maybe they should stick to entertaining the smaller children.
5,Awsome for kids ...,We bought it for our kids and they love it.. They learnt easy tricks and magic from it and showed us everyday. Excellent for beginners and easy to understand tricks.
4,He liked it but...,"I got this for my 9 year old son for Christmas along with a magic top hat set. This is a cool set but comes with a lot of small pieces that can easily be lost so put em in a bag asap after opening it! My son liked this but was impatient about learning ""slight of hand"" which is necessary to do some of the tricks but hey..he has ADD. I was satisfied with this purchase, definitely a good value for the money!"
4,Lots of fun,My daughter has this set and she really loves it. Lots of tricks to keep busy and the case is a plus to keep it all in!!
4,Good for the price,We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our grandson who is a fan of magic. Lots of magic equipment in the set. The only problem was finding the directions which were buried in the box. That was the only hiccup. Max appeared to be enjoying everything when we left to come home.
3,Quality is not there.,"My daughter, who is 9, loves the idea of doing magic tricks. She was quick to try the different tricks in the magic set so I had to help her figure the tricks out. The quality was not there. I have already had to glue some of the parts back together and she is extremely careful with the set. I'm a little disappointed with some of the parts of the kit."
5,Well made and fun,"I bought this magic set for my 6 1/2 year-old grandson. It is very well-made and the tricks that we tried were fun. A few of them were difficult for his young age, but he loved it."
5,Great product,"I got this for my 8 yr old grandson. He really enjoys doing the tricks for his friends. The set is very nicely made, and it comes in a nice wood box."
4,Nice and fun !!!,The set was funny and my kids like it.But the quality of product was not good that I have expected.Anyway it's nice....
5,Perfect Gift!,"This was the best gift! It is a great starter back for the magician in training, glad I bought it!"
4,Best Magic SEt eVer!,I bought this for my nephew- He loves learning how to do real magic and put on a show for all of us!! It's made of wood and is top quality!!Love this product!
3,Lots of fun.,"My 11 year old granddaughter liked this gift, but had trouble learning some of the tricks."
2,Only 3 trickes are good the rest are stupied,"i got to my 7years old kid , it's all made of wood and badly made ,,,the tricks are not funny at all except 3 of them ,,, the rest are really stupeid ,"
1,Eight year old puts on a great show!,Our (almost) eight year old put on a fantastic show with very professional tricks. The quality of the tricks was amazing. Lots of pieces..don't recommend for under age seven. Builds real confidence in the child.
2,Disappointing.......,"I love most of Melissa and Doug's toys but I thought this was to much of the same thing. All the tricks were pretty much the same idea. And every trick was made from wood which makes this durable but not very fun. I remember the magic set my brother had as a kid. It had the glass with the liquid and the quarter trick with the box. Just other things that were quick, fun and easy. I gave this to my niece who is 6 years old. Her eyes lit up when she saw this but when it was opened and played with, I could tell she was not finding these tricks that fun or easy."
4,Great magic set,My kids played for hours with this magic set. It is durable and most tricks can be performed by my 5 years old daughter. Some tricks are very impressive.
5,Very well made at a great price.,"Grandson loves this. He is 8 years old and enjoys entertaining his friends with his magic tricks. Loves it when asked ""How 'd you do that""."
4,They had to recall this product...,Amazon sent me an email about the recall of this product...I got my money back from the manufacturer....
5,Franck Piano Music,"If you admire the piano music of Belgian composer Cesar Franck, then you'll certainly want to own this disc. It consists of transcriptions for piano of his great pieces for organ and harmonium. The transcriptions were done between 1909 and 1912 by extremely competent Frenchmen. Frohnmeyer's performances are excellent, and the sound is good on the nice Belgian label Cypres. At almost 70min running time, the disc is a good value for the $$. Franck's piano music was the first in France to rival the gravitas and dignity of Beethoven's; ""Prelude, fugue et variation,"" for example, is a perennial favorite with its haunting melody."
3,Nice foam balls but no color choice,"I received my order for two foam balls promptly, but did not like the inability to select what color I would receive in each size. I think that there should be the option to select a color . I did not like seeing the company name in large black letters printed on the balls. How hard would it be to offer a plain , blue, 7"" foam ball, without logo? I telephoned the customer service department at US-Games and got a polite response that the balls are not available how I wanted them."
3,A little expensive but...,"The product (4"" foam ball) was delivered quickly, and was as I expected. However I still can't believe I piad a total (including shipping) of $7 and some change for just 1 ball..."
3,"Loud, Don't always work","They work good enough for most applications, but don't work everywhere in the house all the time. X10 is known to not work in everyroom with every plug. You might find it doesn't work for plug far away from switch. Loud click noise during switch is not too classy."
1,Warning FIRE Hazard,"During a power surge from a transformer fire on the street, a number of appliances failed in our house (boiler, stove). Also this x10 appliance module greatly overheated and/or caught fire. Wiring close by as well as the wall was thermally damaged. Model am486."
5,Excellent,"Identical (and compatible) to old Radio Shack units. If it has a flaw, it would be the plug-in (female) SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE FROM THE SIDE OF THE UNIT. This is probably only for some folk's uses."
3,Good try,The cd is good because they recorded the songs with better tech than the first and 2nd records that Blue Cheer made. However I still prefer the original recordings with the original lead guitarist. Warts and all. I do wish they could re-master the 1st and 2nd albums and re-release them but in the meantime I will still listen to them as poorly recorded as they were. Those 3 guys were psychedelic as it gets and were just plain awesome!!!!!
2,"Not as good as Outside Inside, or Vincebus Eruptum","Not as good as Outside Inside, or Vincebus Eruptum albums, which featured leigh stephens on guitar, which made the purity of the cheer's sound, and without it, the music looses aome authenticity"
5,Best of the Set (so far),"Having read the first several volumes of Ralph Moody's works, I didn't think they could get any ""better"" than they already were. ""Fields of Home"" is better though, although perhaps I feel that way because it struck a chord with me in where I live, in the cold northernmost part of New York State. The descriptions of the farming and other activities resonated with stories of my grandparents, my parents and my childhood experiences. The characters seem to be people I know. Awesome book in a great series of books that are appropriate for all ages (my parents love them too)."
4,An easy book to read. Pleasing and relaxing,"I enjoyed this book. Though not a literary classic, it's a great book for a lazy summer afternoon. Written in a very traditional style, you can easily picture the scences being described. The characters are believable, especially if you're familiar with rural life."
5,Be a Kid Again,"One of my most treasured possessions is a letter Ralph Moody sent me when I was a little boy many moons ago. I have read all these books and read them all again from time to time. They are wonderful stories of the way things used to be. They teach some positive life lessons without being too sugar coated. I have heard that many home schoolers use them too. Ralph wasn't a perfect angel when he was working his way through early adulthood, but he was a great man and a great story teller."
1,"Nice features, good service, horrible reliability","I ordered this module thinking it was just another inexpensive lamp module like all the others I own. When I received it, I discovered that, unlike my others of the same brand from years ago, this one has a ""soft on/off"" feature. When you send the module an on or off signal, it slowly ramps up the voltage over the course of two or three seconds rather than suddenly throwing the switch. This gradual change is much easier on your eyes, and it's easier on the bulbs, which should extend their life slightly.Unfortunately, these modules are horribly unreliable. Within a couple weeks, the first module I ordered stopped responding to on/off signals. Smarthome replace it quickly, to their credit. Two weeks after receiving the replacement module, it decided to ignore what I had set the dials to and only respond on code A3. I'll be returning it yet again."
5,Works as advertized,I use these modules with my house alarm. I don't have to enter a dark house and it lights up the rooms on alarm activation.
2,This got sent back,"While it appeared to be a remote, which is what I typed in my search parameter, and the reviews were good, when I received it I immediately realized it was not a remote. It plugs into the wall and probably goes with other components of a Smarthome system. Just keep that in mind on purchasing. The seller was very good on taking it back."
3,Lamp Module,"I finally got this lamp module, It did take a while to arrive to my po box, but I finally got it =) thanks, it very handy cause when I arrive home I like that the lamps are on before I open the door. So I like a lot the practical use of this item."
3,X10 lamp monule,"We had problems getting the timer (purchased separately) to work with this module, did not have time to sort out the ""bugs."""
2,Josh and Zacks stories are much better!!!,"I was very disappointed in Lori Fosters story of Mick and Del. This was very far fetched and I would go has far as to call it silly at times. I absolutly love Lori Foster but this book was not that good. ""Mr. November,"" the story of Josh and ""Treating her right,"" the story of Zack are much better and more believable. I hate to give Lori Foster two points because i usually love her books but this is a dud!"
4,Del's a mystery writer who meets her perfect hero!,"Caught in the Act was a great romance mystery novel. Mick is undercover cop who saves Del in jewelry store heist and gets shot in the process. Del offers to take him home and care for him after the shooting... Check out the whole series; Caught in the Act (1), Treat Her Right (2) and Mr. November: Men to the Rescue (3)."
3,Gorgeous to look at ........gameplay?,"This was an extremly hyped game and while I must admit it was a beautifully rendered game it has the depth of a teaspoon. It was not terribly fun to play unless of course you think simon says needed a championship. It really does look good though! Just keep tapping those buttons and watch Ulala [dance]! And then go to the next scene and tap those buttons And watch Ulala [dance] some more! And then go to the next scene and watch Ulala [dance]......again? Oh did I say this game looks great! Oh I did, well then tap those buttons in time with the music and watch Ulala [dance]!......some more? And just when you think you're Denny Terrio on Dance Fever you gotta do everything reverse of what they do. WOW What a twist...did you see that coming or what. But man what Graphics. Did I mention the graphics? Oh I did. Well than tappity-tap tappity-tap-tap tap-tappity Look im dancing! Cool graphics, oh my god I just saw Michael Jackson!"
4,A dancing game...what?!,"Okay, I admit when my girlfriend was nice enough to buy me Space Channel 5, I was fairly sure it was never even get close to my Dreamcast. I mean, she knows that I only play games where you either kill or drive cars (or even better, both). A dancing game, please? One morning I put it in to play it (while she was there) just to 'prove' that I didn't totally hate it. Please don't tell my friends but this is probably the prettiest and most addictive game that I own. It's not only the first thing that I grab for when I get home everyday, it's the one game that I have that leaves me in a good mood when I'm done playing. Now if I could just get that song out of my head...not to mention that cutie-bug, Ulala! Note: No Morolians were harmed in the writing of this review."
4,SPACE CHANNEL 5,"I think Space Channel 5 is one of the best dance games ever. One of the only flaws of this game is the control. When you push a button, Ulala (the main character) doesn't do the moves she was supposed to. I think the greatest part of this game is the way they walk from alien invasion to alien invasion in a stylish sort of way. The other characters, or Ulala's rivals, Jaguar and Pudding are very strange characters, Pudding being a former pop princess and Jaguar being a... I don't know if hes a man or a woman. Sounds like a man, but looks like a woman.Overall, Space Channel 5 isn't such a bad game after all. All of the shooting and dancing with aliens relieves stress, I guess."
5,Save us Ulala,"must have for dancers and music lovers! Super sexy Ulala must save the human race from dance loving morolians. useing memory, skill, and rythem, she must destroy the morolians. And the music is....how do you say...GROOVIE!! a 60's style with a twist of modren Pop, Techno, and a happy type of Jazz. So you'll be grooving everywhere you go! and you wont be able to stop humming the theme! and the plot has some twists and turns so you'll have to keep on playing untill you finish. La la Bum Da bum Da bum.. This game also requires alot of attention, so dont play if your feel sick or if your tired. you need energy to play this game. You may like Dance Dance Revalioution or Bust a Groove if you like danceing games. ^_^"
4,A Unique Experience,"This game is a great experience not to be missed, however, a rental may be considered wiser than a purchase. I beat this game the first day I rented it, and although there are cool secret levels and the goal of getting a 100% ""view rating"" (the vr is like a scorekeeper for the entire game, rising when you do well, and falling when you do badly), that was not enough for me to go out and buy the game. One thing I liked was the ability to save people and let them join your posse. Seeing 50 or so unique characters falling behind Ulala dancing in rythym is one of the things that makes this game an aesthetic wonder. Although there have been many great games released on the DC(including this one), Sega falls short in the difficulty level of the games it releases. Definetly check it out, but don't say I didn't warn you if this astounding experience ends all too soon."
4,This game has style!,"I think there can be more than one reason to buy a video game. This game is a lot of fun in about as innocent of a way as possible. Sure, gameplay is little more than ""Simon Says,"" and if you're a game addict, you'll probably finish it through and through before bed-time...but the game just oozes with style and great looks. Compared to all the blood and guts (which I enjoy), this game's a very refreshing change of pace.My big criticism is that it's not two players. Or more! I think it would be great to compete against your friends while you're also competing against the computer. It's a shame it's one-player only...a real missed opportunity.The game is cute, it's eye-candy, and it can be a lot of fun on the short term. I support it because it looks and feels great, plus I think Ulala is a great character and I would love to see her come back in other adventures.More over Lara Croft! D'you hear that, Sega?"
4,"Four remixes that do ""the Maestro"" justice!","""Practice What You Preach"", White's 1994 ""comeback"" is featured in three remixes (two by Michael Angelo and one by Kenneth Crouch). It would've been logical to include the album original version if nothing more than for comparison purposes.The final cut is a remix of ""Super Lover"" from 1989's ""The Man is Back"". Unlike the album cut, the ""Undercover Mix"" found on this CD is a lively dance track, heavy on horns, strings, and bass."
5,House of Gryffindor!,"When I saw this item, I bought both it and the Diagon Alley set right away. It's just what I needed. When Ron, Hermione, and Harry want to plan something, do homework, or play wizard chess, they head straight to the common room. Then, after completing their homework, they go to bed. This set is a nice touch, especially if you're getting the whole collection. I love how it comes with books, the bedside cabinet, Scabbers, an owl, the fat lady portrait, the bed with scarlet curtains, etc. I could go on! The colors are not the best, but when you consider that the Gryffindor colors are scarlet and gold, I see where they're coming from. Even if you're not a huge Harry Potter fan, this set can add a lot to any legos you have. The only real downside of this set is that there's only one bed and only one chair in the common room. Overall, I think that this is a great set for all ages."
2,E Rocket Motor Destroyed the Rocket on it Maiden Flight,"The rocket looks nice and wasn't difficult to build but you'd really have to be good a building these things to do it in only 1 hour as another reviewer claimed he and his 5 year old did. And a 5 year old would for the most part merely be an observer. Plus you need to give the glue time to set before moving on the some steps. Even if he did assemble it in one hour as claimed it takes a considerable amount of time to prime, sand, paint, resand, repaint and apply the decals which are very difficult and time consuming.My main disappointment came from the fact that the E9-6 rocket engine exploded shortly after takeoff at approximately 20-25 feet off the ground and destroyed the rocket beyond all repair on it's maiden flight. So beware of these engines! All in all it was a lot of work and a big disappointment for me and my oldest child. But the low level explosion frightened my youngest child very badly."
5,Overwhelming,"This is an almost indescribably remarkable document. More than the finest recorded performance of this great opera ever made, it is one of the finest movements of performance one can ever experience, and it is some kind of miracle that we can hold a relive a piece of the fleeting past. It's irrelevant to describe the beauty and intensity of the music-making, but it caresses and grabs by the throat simultaneously. Vickers is overwhelmingly powerful, he leaps at you from the speakers. That the audiences overpowers the orchestra in their frenzied, passionate response as the finale approaches says more than any critic could. Everyone with an interest opera must own this recording."
4,"Sounds good, some reliability issues","I have had this mixer for several years. I use it only for live performance. During the first year, the second channel started to go bad. It works fine when first plugged in, but after a while the signal level will weaken and finally go out altogether. All the other channels and features work great. It sounds excellent. Bummer to lose a channel though. Haven't bothered to try to get it fixed because I don't need all the channels anyway."
4,Stylus,Thses are great except a little light in touch when playing games on my palm. They are very comfortable in my hand too.
3,"Product is what I needed, but...","Thought that I was getting 3 styluses, and was surprised when only 1 came in the mail (with 3 uses). Also, I got it less than a month ago and have already lost the plastic tip which I use for writing on my Palm."
5,"One Word "" Perfect ""","Just What I Was Looking For. I Must Say, That Every Time I Need Something You Always Come Thru For Me. Thanks..........A Satisfied Customer."
5,Palm Stylus 3-Pack (3178WW),"Palm Stylus 3-Pack (3178WW)I love this product. It fits my Palm TX perfectly and the ink pen is so handy to have. The cap stays on the pen. The price is great, too. I would recommend this to everyone."
5,Nice Original one.,"This is as good as original that come with my for my Palm T/X works perfectly well. I do not have any issues as yet. Apart , I got them at quite reasonable price."
2,Cheap substitute,"I bought this product at Staples. I thought I was getting a quality product, but as one of the previous reviews says, these styli are very lightweight and don't feel at all like the original (which I unfortunately lost). I wish I could find a legitimate, original replacement instead of these cheap imitations. The stylus end screws on and off and it keeps coming loose while I'm using it; plus, it is not straight so I'm constantly rotating the whole thing to find the correct angle to tap with. I suppose the only saving grace is the hidden pen, which I didn't know was there until I read these reviews. No matter, I don't like it."
2,No Guilt in Losing These,"I too would gladly pay $20 for the same stylus that comes with the TX. Although a bulk pack of styli is great for those who are on their PDAs constantly and often misplace styli, I prefer the weight and sturdiness of the original. Since I've begun using one of these new ones I've noticed that the weight feels too light and that both the top and point of the stylus often come unscrewed, which is unnerving. I like the fact that I can lose any of the 3 and not feel bad, but I don't like the quality of these, so I'll keep my original stylus protected in a box and use these cheapy ones for now."
2,"Too lightweight, no reset pin","After purchasing the stylus, I immideatley noticed that the styli were far significantly lighter in weight than the factory included stylus for the Tungsten T5. Even worse, after a fatal exception and hard lock on the T5, I noticed that these styli have no built-in pin to hit the reset button with."
3,Struggling a Little,"I am struggling with this book. There are times when more explanation is needed and yet, at other times, there is too much."
3,Good tips but needs to be updated for today's photography market,The tips Gary Fong gave are very helpful but it definitely needs to be updated. It is my understanding that it is no longer being reproduced and I have not seen in his website for any planned updates. His advice not to give printed proofs to clients is a great one. I find it very helpful and his storytelling of his rise from nothing to greatness as a professional photographer will give a confidence booster to those who are just starting out. Gary Fong is also a good no nonsense entrepeneur.
4,Trials and Tribulations in Tuscany,"This book works on several levels. First of all, it is a very amusing account of adjusting to life in a small Tuscan town. The author struggles with the language, the maddening Italian bureaucracy and the often perplexing social customs. His wife, having visited the area many times, was more familiar with the culture. For example, when bureaucratic red tape slowed progress on home repairs or on the completion of paperwork, she used two things that never failed to bring results: tears and mention of mother. She ""faked"" crying on several occasions to get her way. I can't say I blame her, although it did get kind of old after a while.Nothing seemed to get done without food being involved either. Lots of food.Another reason this book works is as a travel book. You will learn things here about Italy that you will never find in a Rick Steves' tourbook.And finally, this book works because it is wickedly funny. An enjoyable read."
5,A light summer read...,"Phil Doran's dry humor is evident in this light-hearted romp under the Tuscan sun. The story sounds predictable with an American writer escaping to Italy impulsively buying a fixer-upper in the country. Sounds familiar? Sounds like the plot for Under the Tuscan Sun, only this version is from a man who has the knack for comedy. Doran is the writer and producer of the tv hit Wonder Years. The Reluctant Tuscan has the feel of Peter Mayle's travel diaries but with more story than diary. Would be great for a light summer read."
5,Great book....but I'm biased.,My family and I live in Germany. We are considering moving to Italy. I was very interested in reading Phil's experiences. It would be a good easy read without the personal interest. It is humorous but some of the humor would be based on knowledge of Italy and it's people.
2,Ordinary tales,"Not hilarious or disarmingly funny. Basically, it is the Ugly American goes to Paradise and wins. He gets a life, some friends, and a book deal. There is some Archie Bunker-type humor based upon stereotypes and caricatures, which apparently goes over with his agent. But there are some amusing stories and some of them are probably true. He does not seem to know much about American rodeo, however, which highlights his know-it-all arrogance at the end."
1,Don't buy this book!,"What a dreadful piece of tripe. The Italians are all caricatured into stereotypes and it is obvious the author took great liberties with the truth. The plot is preposterous. (Those stupid Italians! They couldn't even tell the difference between someone's cremated ashes and powered milk!) The coincidences are unbelieveable. (Those stupid Italians again! They actually thought, after seeing a photocopied picture of The Sopranos hanging on the wall that they were related to the author and got to work on his house because they were afraid for their lives.) The writing style is crude. One character is described as going off either to pray or masturbate. If I could give this book no stars I would. In fact I'm not even going to give it away. It goes directly into the trash bin."
3,Buy,"This is a great book for all ages. If you are going to Italy its a book with many insides to the population and culture.Also, lots of humor about these 2 Americans, building a home."
3,There's much better out there.,"Mildly entertaining and surprisingly poorly written for an author with a good deal of writing credits (the bulk of which were for TV so maybe this explains it...). I do love reading memoirs of folks who decide to up and move to Italy -- and maybe I've read too many of them now and, hence, they're all beginning to sound the same. Anyway, if you're interested in the material I'd start with ""Italian Neighbors Or, a Lapsed Anglo-Saxo in Verona"" by Tim Parks and/or even ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes."
4,Great Read with Humor!,"Combines wit with real life in a very entertaining format. The author has a sense of humor that is hilarious when read, perhaps not so funny to live with (the best kind)! Based on his true life experience, clips along nicely."
4,Experience the Italian way of life,"Phil Doran has written a very enjoyable account of moving to Tuscany and trying to rebuilding a house and his life. He struggles with trying to restart his career in Hollywood, being with his wife after years of long distance marriage and building a house in a country where he doesn't speak the language and he doesn't know the customs. The end result is a funny, touching account of how he finds what he really wants in his career and marriage. Doran's descriptions and characters capture his frustrations and his growing fondness for his adopted home. Can a workaholic screenwriter move to Tuscany and adjust to a much slower pace of life? You will have to read the book to find out."
4,The Reluctant Tuscan,I had just returned from Tuscany and was given this book - I was sitting on a dock that summer reading this laugh-out-loud book - I could relate!I have since given out several copies to my fellow Tuscan travellers! Looking for a sequel!
4,"Funny, also informitive","This book is a quick read. It is both funny and imformitive about Italy. Sometimes people have to do strange things to get things done in a country that only follows its laws ""somewhat"""
3,Occasionally amusing but hardly believable,"I found this book in my apartment in Montepulciano. Chapter 13 deals, in part, with Mr. Mazzetti's coppersmith shop, a real place in Montepulciano. The descriptions of the shop and its nearby workshop turned out to be pretty accurate, but I have doubts about much of the rest of what the book recounts.There are too many improbabilities in terms of characterization and plot. Or maybe it's just that the earlier ""How we adapted to life in a Tuscan ruin"" books pretty well exhausted the possibilities."
2,Hanyak,"I love the Association. They are a great GROUP!! I was waiting for this DVD. When I saw it, the sound and video very dissapointing. I am sure they are very good during this live concert but no one edited the actual audio for this DVD to make it presentable for sale. The video really does not show who is singing other parts. This DVD only focused on the two the main singers."
3,Its at best OK,Ok is my best at describing this DVD - they do look like a lounge band trying to be the Association or at least trying to play the songs. Since you will probably never get another chance to see these songs played by more original members then you might at least enjoy the songs here. The musicians are competent - the singing is at best Ok but is missing quite a bit of real Association harmony. The oufits are comical and someone should have told them something - the real Association would have never put that stuff on - the ties are a disgrace to the name. get it for cheap and you will probably at best find it ok.
1,The Real Association,"This is not the real band, but a sad imitation. Any version of this band that does not include Terry Kirkman, Jim Yester,Gary Jules Alexander, Ted Bluechel or Brian Cole is not the real thing. This is just a blatant attempt to rip stupid people off. It's just sad, but ignorance is bliss"
5,I Got My Copy Today And.....................,"it was worth the wait. These guys sound better then ever. I am so glad that I pre-ordered this DVD. It is an hour long and the time goes by quite quickley. I'll listen to it again, tonight.Don"
5,Hogwarts Classroom And the Mirror of Erised,"This set contains two Classrooms, Harry and the Mirror of Erised as well as sevaral other thingsPros: has a classroom, comes with the Mirror of Erised, Mirror reflection is reversable so you can make it Harry and his mom and dad and an ordinary mirror.Cons: little pricey, The mirror's reflection is a sticker so you need to be carefull when putting on the rest of the Mirror.all in all a great buy! And I love it!"
5,So happy!,I purchased this mattress and I'm very happy I did! We needed to upgrade our RV mattress and I searched high and low. Somehow I stumbled upon this at Amazon.com. The price is awesome and shipping is free. It did take a while to get to my house - atleast 10 days but it arrived as they said and now we are sleeping like babies on a very comfortable mattress! Good buy!
3,RV Mattress review,Based on the reviews of this mattress we expected it to be amazing and it's not. It is much more firm than anticipated. Had we been able to lay on it before buying we wouldn't have purchased it.
5,Really Neat!,"I ordered two of these mattresses to replace the pieces of foam my kids were sleeping on (that came with my 5th wheel). I was really stumped when they arrived as they are vacuum packed for shipping and quite compact. Once taken out of the bag they are just like ""real"" innerspring mattresses and my children love them. I would highly recommend these to anyone."
3,no roots,"A friend got me a tape of Cheb Mami's Mela Mela when he was teaching English in Saudi Arabia. I liked that album alot and based upon that, I bought Layali. There are some good songs but overall, I found the cd to be very techno-pop and not very Algerian. I admit that as a white guy from the Midwest I am not hip to the youth culture of Algeria but Layali sounds to me like any other pop album from anywhere. In other words, it is nothing special."
4,great book,"Fun book with interesting facts. Homey, friendly style. Looking forward to driving the route soon and visiting places mentioned in the book."
3,good ideas,"Bought this book based on personal recommendation and other reviews. Was planning to drive from the Detroit area to Atlanta, Georgia with family, including two children. There were great ideas in the book, including plenty of things within an hour's drive from home that we plan to do in the future and had not known about. Unfortunately, hubby decided to vear off the straight and narrow, and we ended up not driving the 75 route the whole way like we had first planned. In fact, only utilized it through southern Ohio! The main negative about the book is the suggestion to utilize hotel coupon books obtained at welcome centers. Turns out many of those coupons are not usable on weekends or during special events, and are not usable if you call ahead - so you have to drive to the hotel to see if there are openings. As a result, being gone 12 nights, we were only able to use a coupon for one night! That was a major disappointment."
1,Why has I-75 within Florida been excluded from this book ??,"Here I thought I had the perfect book for my upcoming journey from Boca Raton to Sarasota via I-75. It arrives today and I search the pages for I-75 in Florida. What a downer! I can't understand why the author did not complete his work for the entire distance of I-75, instead of ending it at the Florida-Georgia border. Perhaps he ran out of gas. No matter - Tomorrow I'm returing this book to Amazon!"
3,Handy but Incomplete,"This is a nice book to have if you are driving on I-75 for any prolonged period of time. But I can't help but be annoyed that it omits hundreds of miles of the freeway 1.) from Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, to Detroit, 2.) all around the Macon, GA area, and 3.)from the Georgia-Florida Border to Miami, FL."
5,A great book for the I-75 Traveler,"This was our third edition, and it was great, as always. The only negative was the elimination of local radio stations that previous editions included."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"This game has the most outstanding graphics. But the worst concept of gameplay and controls ever to grace my television scream , there is no batting/pitching cursor. Fielding is terrible. An advisory to gamers of the world. Sega struck out with World Series Baseball 2k1"
1,Sega dropped the ball on this one.... literally,"This game is the absolute WORST baseball game of all time. You cannot field, throw, catch, bat, follow the cameras, etc... it's the saddest thing to happen to baseball since the strike cancelled the world series. I gave it one star because it is pretty (except for the textured shadows on the players), but that one star is very generous on my part. Save your money, or go dust off your N64 and play All Star Baseball for an afternoon."
1,"Disgusted, at best","Is it just me, or did they not finish this game or something? The game is consistantly slow, unresponsive, and absolutely boring. The graphics are decent, but as a sports game that will only go so far. Who cares how good the catcher looks trying to pick off a runner at second base, when he just stands there as you continuosly press the button trying to throw the ball. The outfielders stand in one spot and after a delay they begin to run for the ball, as it's flying over their heads. The crowd noise is annoying, it sounds like a track from an old atari game...the game's simply not exciting in any way shape or form. This game is an embarassment to the Dreamcast."
1,Deserves a negative star rating,"WSB 2K1 is the most disappointing game I've ever played. I sold my copy of the game to Funcoland two days after I bought it. Do not waste your money. The guy at Funcoland summed it up better than I ever I could: ""It seems like Sega released the beta version of this game"". You can hit the ball and you can pitch the ball. But you can't field it (the game does that for you, though you do control where the fielder throws the ball once he picks it up.). The game-controlled fielders make stupid choices and they are slow to respond to ""throw commands"". The commentator is horrible and you can't shut him up! The in-game options are weak. The crowd noice is annoying and their movements robotic. Blah, blah, blah. It's terrible. Don't waste your time."
1,"If your looking for a baseball game, this is NOT it!","First of all, ever since I played NFL 2K AND NBA 2K I have been waiting with great passion for this game to finally come out. I must tell you that this game was the biggest dissapointment I have ever seen. What was Sega thinking making a baseball game where you have no control of fielding. The batting and pitching controls are descent at best. If Sega thinks that graphics alone makes a great game then they have another thing coming. Controls are everything in a sports game, graphics or no graphics. I really feel cheated that I wasted [money] on this garbage. That will be the last time I ever buy a game without playing it first. Attention baseball fans! If you want a fun baseball game, stick with MLB 2001 on playstation or All Star Baseball on N64."
1,Save Your Money,"This game is NO WHERE NEAR the caliber of NFL2K and NBA2K. I have had it for several days and here are just a few of my complaints: CANNOT CONTROL THE DEFENSE!, cheesy fan animations, Runners look like they are on a slip and slide, Annoying commentary, poor sound effects for croud and ball hitting the glove. CANNOT CONTROL THE DEFENSE!, hitting and throwing controls are sluggish, 680 foot homeruns (that is wonderful attempt at realism), among others. Did I mention you CAN'T CONTROL THE DEFENSE? This is the only game I have ever played where you can't control the defense. Great pitcher and hitter graphics, they just left out too many key elements to make fun. Hopefully ESPN Baseball Tonight will finally come out and be done a lot better. Save your money."
1,This is a huge step back!,WSB2K1 is a joke. The whole game feels like a homerun contest becasue you CANT FEILD! The computer actually does it for you. You have very limited control of the pitcher and when your hitting you have to hit the R trigger twice just to swing. The game feels like you are watching a preview of a beautiful game while pushing buttons pretending to play. I have wasted my time and money with this game.
1,"WSB2K1 is pure acrade,a place where bsbll games dont belong","WSB2K1 is nothing but a pretty face, dont be foold by the other reviews...i love my dreamcast, but this game has nothing to offer but graphics. The fielding is automatic, which takes away 1/3 of the game...and it ""slows down"" whenever you steal a base. Also, it seems like all hits are in the outfield or home runs. This game should be played by the easily amused 16 and unders who want nothing more than to swing the bat."
2,Its not what its supposed to be!,"The game doesnt have player injuries like was mentioned in so many game details and that is just one of the things its missing that was advertised-Homerun derby, weather problems(delays), Hot and Cold zones of a batter versus a pitcher, the so-called 32 possible pitches per pitcher, and there are less camera angles than a Genisis baseball game. This game was simply rushed out to the market to beat ESPN baseball tonight. If they had just included the above things like was suppsed to included this game would have been fine.... Instead it is just a baseball game with great graphics. I am hoping baseball tonight will improve or I will play EA sports version on PS2 next summer."
1,Biggest Disappointment of the year,"Sure the graphics are great, but that is where it all ends. I don't think there is anyone more disappointed than me about this game. I was counting the days to play it, to only find out how much of a stinker this one is. The gameplay for World Series Baseball 2K1 is awful, the controls aren't sensible(and you can change them if you wanted to).The biggest problem in this game is that THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY FIELDS THE BALL FOR YOU ! Where is the fun in that ? You can't even turn that option off. There is a lack of batting camara angles, and the menus for creating players isn't fluid, I can go on and on. Just heed my warning, THIS GAME STINKS."
2,World Series Baseball 2K1 is the worst game ever!,"The game has great graphics and and very smooth gameplay but, the biggest problem with it is that you cant even field so when the CPU hits teh ball you can just sit there and wait for the CPU on your side to get it. It gives me the feeling of little control. The pitching could be better. I mean come on you got this little circle with lines pointing off of it in different directions you have to look in the book for WSB 2K1 to find out which pitch is which. The aiming thing to bat. I hate that even though they do have a cheat for it. Well I think they could have done a hell of a lot better."
3,An attempt to redeem this game.....,"Okay........ I know what your thinking, after reading all these negative reviews to not buy this game. Well I totally agree that there are many faults, but after playing it a while and getting a season going its not that bad, it just takes a while to get used to. It is different than any other baseball game, especially triple play, but im telling you..... you need to give this game a try if you are looking into a baseball game with good graphics and decent gameplay.Do not let these other reviews get you down!"
1,Huh?,This is by far the biggest let down in all of video game sports history. I dont understand how this game made it to the streets. The game is in no way playable. I feel like Sega beat me out of 50 dollars and I deserve that back with an apology. I played it for two innings and refuse to even touch it again. Not being able to play defense is enough never to play the game but in two innings at least 20 flaws were apparent. I am disgusted and recommend Sega pulling of the shelves and apologizing to everyone.
1,Worst Game Ever,This has to be the worst video game ever made. The way the hitting is controlled is a joke. A chimp could have designed it better. I will not buy another dreamcast baseball game until I play it first.
1,world series 2k1,"This game is not like the baseball game that is on TV. This is a make believe game. On this game a player can hit a homerun or base hit on almost ever play that take all the fun out of the game. It is hard to catch and the scoring of the game is too high. The inning on this game are to long.There is a couple of good things about the game, the player face looks real and they are batting like they do on TV. The game play is totally uncool and is not much fun."
4,A 4 star review may look weird with all these bad reviews.,"Look, I'm no expert at baseball games, so I may not have noticed some of the mistakes Sega made, but I did notice a couple:1. You can't control the fielding until the computer catches the ball (then you can control the player throwing it),2. The replays are repetitive and boring, but at least you can turn them off. 3. Throwing the ball to the bases is kind of tough because instead of pushing buttons that resemble bases like in other Baseball games, you have to put the analog in the direction of the base, hold it there, and press A.Besides those problems, I liked the game. And it wasen't as bad as some people say it is. So rent it to see if you like it or not. Don't let these bad reviews stop you from trying the game."
1,HORRIBLE,"One star is as low as we can go? I'm not one for writing reviews on Amazon.com, but I wish I read some before I bought this game. The graphics are very good at first, but they repeat themselves, and they get boring FAST. I've played the game over and over, trying to make myself think that maybe somehow it wasn't a complete waste of [money].My advice? If you see this game on sale for ... somewhere..... You'll still be disappointed by it. Order a pizza."
1,No Don't Do It!,"Watch out! This game is awful. The graphics and commentary are buggy to all ends. This game was completely rushed out the door, and as a result, suffers immensely. The graphics are 'sometimes' nice, but the crowds look like something off of Genesis. The fielding is atrocious (you can't even control your fielders! the computer does it for you!), there is no home run derby, almost no options, a skeletal season system (that has no career mode, just one season) and the music and sound effects sound like something from the original NES days. What a horrible disappointment. Do not buy this game! Show Sega that they can't just put a sub mediocre product on the market and expect everyone to buy it."
1,What had a chance a greatness falls short,"I was looking forward to this title. Being hyped as the best baseball game ever made I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, instead of following in the steps of NFL 2K, it takes the path of the mediocre NHL 2K. WSB 2K1 from the get-go looks rushed. The player graphics and the stadium graphics are superb individually but they do not mesh together and it looks very tacky and unrealistic. The controls are choppy. It lacks a fantasy draft which is what I was looking forward to the most. At least the rosters are fairly up to date. Rent it before you buy it."
1,this is the best they can do?,"wow, this game looks beautiful, i can see actual players faces! the stadiums look great, yippee! now try playing it, better yet, try fielding a fly ball...better yet, try playing a 9 inning game in less than half an hour! why dont i just take [money] and set it on fire next time...i couldnt get virtual tennis back in my dreamcast fast enough"
1,I own and want to throw away this game,"Im not sure what game everyone else is playing but i bought this game on 7/21/00 and it is the worst game ive ever tried to play. You cannot move your men when fielding. The cpu controlls all players on the field.You cannot run, jump, dive , or fall at all.You get to choose the base the player throws the ball to, That is it.If you want to watch baseball try the real thing after all you cant beat those graphics. if you want to play a baseball videogame buy anything else. this game strikes out big time.it is the goat of all baseball games.At a time when sega needs it most,This game fails on all sides. I am surprised they even tried pushing it on the American Public.WE PLAY OUR GAMES WE WATCH OUR T.V."
4,mostly good,"This game is great except for a couple of aspects...you can't field yourself and you can't skip through some animation sequences. They look cool at first but after the first few games it's like ""come on, already!"". But this game I didn't like at first but now I really like. It grew on me so I still reccommended this game."
1,What was Sega thinking?,I wish that I used to review games as a job because the only way I can play World Series Baseball 2K1 is if I were paid to do it!!
1,The worst baseball game ever!,I am pretty angry that I spent [$] for this piece of junk. This is the worst baseball game ever.
1,Oh my god...,"This is the the worst excuse for a baseball game I have played in a long time. The graphics are obviously great, but that is all. The announcer sounds like a robotic dork, the crowd is a mess, it looks like a bunch of blobby sprites, and the gameplay is absolutely horrible. This is supposed to be a next generation game, yet you can't even control your fielder's! You choose which base to through to after they've missed the ball and jogged to pick it up, this is the very worst baseball game in terms of gamelpay that you can buy, period. The graphics do not make up for it. Avoid this game like the plague unless you like staring at nice player models on pause."
3,IT'S NOT ALL THAT!,"I just purchased this game and have been playing it for a day.....and I DON'T find this game to be as good as it SHOULD be. Most baseball games usually comes out when the season starts, so this game has been pushed back already...and the result is NOT as great as it should be. I must say the graphics are spectacular...but there's not all that I'm looking for. There could be some improvements, for example: a dynasty mode(like the ones from any EA sports games) would be nice. The GM mode is terrible! I can't trade multiple players in one transactions, I can't release a player, and there's no valuation on the trade...basically there's not much but a one for one deal, and that's not even"
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this game. I thought that it took them so long to get the game out that it would be outstanding but falls short of mediocre. You don't even have control of the defense which is half of the game. Boring! Forget about trying to beat the computer in All Star mode. It can't be done. With a runner on first or second the second baseman stands near second base which you can't move him and the hitter will hit the hole between 1st and 2nd every time. The most disappointing is that when a runner is on first and the batter hits a pop up the 1st baseman won't catch it and it drops for a hit. No control of defense.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
1,All Bluff and no Stuff,"This game has great graphics, of course; but the game play is equally reciprocated. In this game you are only allowed to throw and hit. All the excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away. You cannot play defense at all! Your job is to throw in the right direction, but that is even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press the throw button repeatedly. Even if you get the throw off in time, your player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally attempts to make a tag; and by then it's obviously too late. Speaking of delayed reactions, the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the ranks of Genesis games. I would take the classic, ""Bases Loaded"", over this junk any day."
3,"Not great, but it'll have to do.","Well baseball fans, WSB 2K1 is finally here for the dreamcast, and those of you who had hoped it would be like the former titles on saturn and genesis will be thoroughly disappointed. The major problem lies in the fact that you cannot control your fielders. What were you thinking Sega? Other gripes about the game are that the crowd looks like something you'd see on a 64 or 32 bit system, and the play by play disappoints those who enjoyed the commentary in the previous 2K games. However, this game turns out to have some positive aspects as well, with its amazing graphics, real batting stances, and well designed batter/pitcher interface. Bottom line, rent this one before you buy it. This will be the only baseball title coming out for the dreamcast this season, so if you're desperate for a baseball game like I was, you'll probably opt to get this one."
4,Don't listen to the naysayers,"I've read several bad reviews of this game so let me give you my perspective in thier conplaints. First the play by play is awful, I turn the sound down and listen to a cd. However no one ever bought a game because it had good play by play. Second, the fielding/batting/pitching engines are difficult because they are difficult in real baseball. I think it mirrors real baseball beacause it's hard to pitch and hit and field. To paraphrase the great Ted Williams, ""The hardest thing in the world to do is hit a baseball."" So get over it and practice the game....It gets easier with practice. as for this so-called frame rate slowdown, no one seemed to notice it only slows down for close plays. To conclude, this game is very realistic and very enjoyable once you get used to its quirks. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because that style and realism first appeared in NFL2K. So it isn't revolutionary anymore. If you love videogame baseball, buy this game.....go Reds!"
1,Still the worst baseball game ever....,"I gave this game a three-star review a couple days ago, after playing it over the first weekend I had it. Then I thought I'd play some more just to be fair, and hey, I had already spent the money anyway. Let me just say that the people who gave this 5 stars are not concerned with actually PLAYING the game. Take it from me, it only gets more frustrating by the minute... Now it's only worth one star for the graphics. I'm not wasting anymore time with Sega; what a letdown since NFL 2K. I placed an ad for my Dreamcast in the local paper and will wait for PS2. That's right, WSB2K1 has actually driven me over the edge. I'm done.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME."
2,This game is OK,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. Batting is VERY difficult. They put up the strike zone, but then give you no indication of where the pitch is heading until it is past you making it alomost purely a guesing game to try and hit the ball. I can't even tell you how disapointing it is that there is no Home Run Derby (I don't feel like playing a game all the time). The graphics are cool and the stadiums are up to date (including PacBell Park in SF).Overall, I'm bummed I bought this game."
1,Very dissappointing,This is easily the worst baseball game I have ever played. This game features diffcult feilding and almost impossible hitting. The graphics are subpar for the dreamcast format. The bottom line is dont buy this game dont even waste your money renting this game!
1,A disaster from top to bottom.,"As devoted a fan as I am to Dreamcast...Given the monumental achievements made with NFL-2K and NBA-2K, this game is an abysmal failure.And as much as it pains me to say this, even Ken Griffey's Slugfest for the Nintendo 64 is superior in game play."
2,Disappointed,"If you are a true baseball enthusist, I think you may be disappointed in this game. If you are only into graphics, you will be pleased. What I am basing this off of is my history with N64 All-Star Baseballs. 2K1 lacks the following in comparison: Lack of control of fielding, minimal graphics, & the inability to strategize your game (pitchouts, directing bunts, etc.) Oh yeah, and if your into replays, forget it unless you are stealing or get a simple base hit (better get a good look at those 475' bombs the first time. I'm glad my friend bought it before I did."
2,Very Disappointing,"Once you get past the awesome graphics, the gameplay on this game is very weak. The true test of a baseball sim is how much it can emulate the technical game of baseball, with all of its intricasies. This game falls short in so many ways it would take me hours to list them all. In a nutshell, the hardcore baseball fan will find this game very disappointing."
3,Great game ? Whatever!,"The graphics are awesome! Almost real. The replays are ok, but are better if the computer does not run them. Game play is the problem. What the game does not tell you is that you CAN NOT control the fielding, and there is no option to let you control it. All fielding is done by the computer. I hate that because the computer is VERY slow to react. It is no fun when you can't make a play. All you can do in the field is press a button to throw a ball. Hitting is like the original games, but it is difficult, even on rookie level. I would recommend renting this game before buying it. I want my money back. Sega sports takes low score on this one."
3,coulda been better,"The graphics in this game are astonishing. Players look like their real life counterparts and the stadiums are dead on. The only problem is the flat, 2-d crowd. Come on Sega you can do better than that. Now here was the real flaw : Gameplay. The pitching and batting are fine but YOU CANT EVEN CONTROL YOUR OWN FIELDING! Your outfielders botch up plays while the AI's are perfect. it is this and the lack of depth that keep this game from reaching its full potential. ok as a rental but not realy worth shelling out 50 bucks. Hardcore gamers need not apply."
1,It's terrible,"I'm the biggest baseball fan you'll ever meet, this game is pathetic. To bat, you have to hold a trigger while moving ur finger @ a 45 degree angle. Pitching is impossible. It is the worst"
3,Okay frustrating at first,it was an OK game you can't field the ball but you get used to it. then it gets fun
2,The worst baseball video game I ever played.,The day I opened the game I thought about all the baseball games I have playedand this was going to bbe the best. But I was wrong the controls are horrible.To took me 5 innings to figure out how to swing the bat right. The annoncer bearly even talks. There is almost no music during the game. The best pard is you almost always hit home runs when you bat. But when your pitching you have no idea what type of pithch your thtrowing. The fealding it very hard to do. Im still playing tripple play 2000 for the pc that is way better. So stay away.
2,"It looked soo good at first, What went wrong?","A total waste of time!! Never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible. I got the game thinkin I could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game. But as I began to play a little and realized how bad the game really was I started to wonder if it was the same game as shown on the case? But after minutes trying to convince myself that the store had made a mistake packaging, I realized I made the mistake of buying the awful game. No lie here, the worst baseball game to date, hands down. Just take my advice, stay away!"
2,not their best,"I've been touting the Dream Cast's sports game for some time now. Generally they are some of the best--NFL 2K, NBA 2K, Virua Tennis... I suppose it shouldn't come as a surprise that sooner or later I'd find one that isn't that great. And I'm not surprised it is the baseball game. Unlike football and basketball, there really is no movement in a baseball game, which I think is partially responsible for how much I dislike this game. Just being baseball itself. Add that to a difficulty in pitching and batting, and the problems with fielding a ball and you've got a game that isn't real great (I remember a nintendo baseball game that was more fun, even if the graphics weren't that great). I will say that the stadiums and graphics are beautiful, but it takes more than a pretty picture to make a fun game. And this game isn't much fun."
2,It Sucks worst Baseball game ever,"This game was relly disapointing, it's not even basebal it's jsut bat practice the graphics and the realism is really good but once you play it's no fun, i recommend another sport i hope 2k2 is goin to be better, and you can't even skip to the game you have to wait until the anthem is over"
1,Wanna throw away [$]-heres your chance!,"This wont take long. Dont buy this game like I did. Dont think it would be as good as nba2k or nfl2k-Its Not! Graphics get 5stars/everything else no stars. Sega's add campaign 5 stars. This is the worst baseball game I have ever played, that includes atari baseball, which has more playablity and fun factor. This is [$] I am going to forget about."
2,Average,"The graphics are exceptional, hitting and pitching are tops in the market. However, why would anyone design a game where you can't control the defense. Who's ridiculous idea was it to have the computer make the plays for you and only allow the game player to throw the ball. Stupid! This could have been a great game, but instead it's all but average. Cool graphics are great, but they don't make a great game. The game needs to be played, both offense and defense. Back to the drawing board for Sega."
1,What happened to pride?,"It's just ashame. In an obvious effort to satisfy a deadline Sega makes the mistake of pushing an unfinnished product out the door. Now I am hesitant, I don't know whether or not to sell my dreamcast and switch to the new PS2 because Sega does not seem concerned with product quality. This game is horrible. Sure its nice to look at but try playing it. You have no control over virtually every aspect of the game. B4 u buy it at least rent it first and see for yourself. I am begging the dreamcast game engineers Please don't let this happen again, take some pride in what you create, besides this isn't Teletubies or South Park, it's an American past-time."
3,What???,"I got this yesterday, and its just stupid. You start off noticing the great graphics. Then i noticed a good bating/pitching procedure. My brother then hit it against the back wall and i was just wondering why my stupid guy reacted so slow and i couldn't control him. O well i can deal with that. I then pitched it and my brother started to steal second. I hit A and up repeaditly and by the time my slow guy threw it the stealer had already wiped off the dirt off his uniform after sliding. He then did the same thing for 3rd. Next the only modes it has is exhibition, quick start, season, and custimize??? The season just allows you to play a seaon with no trading. The bottom line is the game is lame except for great graphics."
1,major major major major disappointment,"Sega made the greatest baseball game of all time in World Series Baseball 98 for the Saturn. With that in mind I simply could not wait to see what 2k1 would look like for the dreamcast. I must say I was extremely disappointed. The game moves too slow, the music is bad, and the sound effects are horrendous. What were they thinking when they decided too let the computer do the fielding?I could go on and on but I would rather just get to the point: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
3,A major league let down,"If you want the best baseball graphics around then I suggest buying this game. But if you are like me and you like the controls of the game then you will be let down by this game Sure the pitching and the batting are so realistic you will think you are actually there pitching and hitting, But sega left out a key part in any good baseball game... THE FIELDING.... You are unable to control the fielders meaning that if you want AROD to make a diving play you cant, the computer does it for you. You cant even have griffey rob someone of a homerun. The only thing you can do is throw the ball to one of the four bases. In my opinion this game is a let down, all good gamers know that fielding is an important aspect of baseball, so I guess I will have to wait for ESPN Baseball Tonight"
3,Not Sega's Best Work,"Pros: Graphics- The best thing on this game is the graphics. All the players look EXACTLY like the real players. Player piching and batting moves are wonderfully done. The stadium shots were also incredible.Cons: The commitator for this game gets REALY montonious. He says the same thing over and over again. Also, the fielding on the game was horrible. All of it was automatic. It frustrating to see players not catch balls that are hit right at them.Over all the game was okay."
4,One of the best baseball games,The teams are outdated and the reporter doesnt really sound like he cares.Besides that the graphics are really good.You can create a player and play a season with him and they keep track of his stats.They dont have any real good rookies.Some of the players are better than they say they are and others are to good
2,throwing and batting? thats it.,Throwing and batting. that gets pretty boring. thats all you can do. the graphics are awesome. better than a playstation 2. the batting is okay but the throwing stinks. all the players throw is rainbows. since you can't field the ball it gets boring extremely quickly. it takes a while to get used to the hitting. the hitting is difficult to learn. these are the reasons i gave it a two star rating. i do NOT reccomend this game to anyone. i would wait till 2k2 comes out. don't waist your money.
2,high hopes,how can this game be good if you can not even control your fielders.So what i am trying to get to you is what kind of a baseball fan likes a game where the computer controls your fielders and not you.There are also other glitches in the game like sometimes in the infield your infielder runs in place before catching the groundball whitch results to the computer being safe on first.There is one good thing world series baseball 2K1 has good updated rosters for the 2000 season not the 2001 season.Also pitching to the batters can be fun but with all the glitches and not being able to control all your fielders drags the game down to a two.I really had high hopes for 2K1 to bad the game is not good.
2,boring,I can some this game up in one word lame . The only thing in my opinion this game has going for it is the graphics. What moron thought of the idea of having computer controlled fielding. That takes the fun out of the game. Though the pitching is ok and the batting is almost acceptable i think if you want a good video game get virtua tennis
2,Buyer beware,"Go read Igndc.com for initial impressions of Baseball 2K1. Apparently, this game has been rushed out the door and has commentary and graphics bugs. It made me change my mind about pre-ordering this, at least until I read more reviews. And I was so looking forward to it!"
1,this game is horrible,"first of all on a scale of 1-10 id rate this game a -2,thegraphics are the best ever, but the game play ... its hard to bat you don't even get to control your fielders and the AI stinks. so overall id say don't waiste your time and money by buying it, dont even rent it."
1,"Poor baseball, to be represented by this game.","This game has good graphics and that's about all. This game doesn't have four player capability, despite the fact that it could have it. This game doesn't have the capability of two players to play on the same team. For Pac Bell Park, it doesn't have the big glove or the big coke bottle in the left field stands. Just not a fun game to play, it's very dissapointing."
2,What Could Have Been,"This game has great graphics, excellent player models and intense realism. But the hitting interface is incredibly difficult, and nearly impossible to judge pitches. And this game commits the greatest crime of all, the fielders on your team field automoatically and there is no way to change this. It is ridiculous. Even NES baseball games let you field the ball. What were they thinking?"
2,Triple Play for Playstation is MUCH better!,"I had to wait all this time for this? I was VERY disappointed with this game! It just isn't fun to play! Sure the graphics are pretty realistic, down to the player's faces, but that's the only strength of the game. The sound effects and announcing are terrible, the crowd in the stands looks very fake, and the game play is the worst. The computer does all of the fielding for you, including running to and catching all ground and fly balls. All that's left for you to do is to throw the ball after the play is done. What fun is there in that? I love making plays on defense, but this game doesn't even give me a shot! The pitching is pretty bad too, requiring you to aim your pitch and select the pitch speed at the same time. It just makes pitching harder then it needs to be. The hitting is ok, but not great.If you have Playstation too, stick with Triple Play. It is much more fun to play than this is."
1,If you like baseball don't buy this game!,"I don't care what everyone else says this game is horrible. The graphics are great, I'll give Sega that. Gameplay is disgusting. Let's start off with the auto fielding. You heard that right AUTO FEILDING. Not fun at all. Sound has is ups and downs, unfortunatly mostly downs. This is not a game I would expect from Sega, especially in house. (It was developed by Sega of Japan.) Unless you are a MASSIVE baseball fan I would stay far away from this game."
2,Freeloading Outfielders,"Graphics? Great. Controls? Confusing as all get-out. Fair warning: You can't control the fielders on your own. You have to wait for one of them to get to (or catch) the ball, then hope that you know how to throw it to one of the bases. That was one of the cool things about the previous versions of World Series baseball that Sega put out for the Genesis. It's a shame that you have to sacrifice game play just so you can see John Rocker's face in detail when he walks someone."
3,Not a home run!,"I just played WSB2K1 for the first time and found the graphics awesome. Stadium characteristics are shown in great detail and ball players features including facial features and individual manerisms, such as Mike Musina's bending before each pitch, set this game apart from any I've seen to date.Having been impressed with the graphics, I was disappointed with the game controls. I started in legend mode, thinking that it would offer the most control, and found it limiting and awkward. I was surprised to find that the computer controlled fielding. Sega definitely has to rework the fielding for WSB2K2."
1,Not worth the dough!,"This game has absolutly wonderful graphics, I couldn't ask for more. But what this game doesn't lack in graphics it lacks in game play. The game doesn't respond as quickly as other baseball games that I have played. It has automatic fielding which means the computer does most of the defense. When the players through the ball it doesn't replicate the actual throwing motion of the real players also the trajectory of the ball doesn't look as acurate. Instead of a hard, fast throw it is more of a high, slow lob.In my opinion this game isn't worth the time nor the effort. I made a fatal mistake in buying this game. I am now waiting for ESPN's MLB game."
1,This Game is Just Bad,"I love baseball games. I have played them ever since I was 5 years old and got ""Baseball"" on the NES. All I have to say was that game was more fun than WSB 2K1. In ""Baseball"" I could not field the ball, but that was like 16 years ago. In WSB 2K1, on what is supposed to be the most advanced system to date, I can't field the ball. But at least the Players in ""Baseball"" knew how to play baseball. The players in WSB 2K1 could be beat by a YMCA t-ball team. Why does my pitcher run to center field to make a catch? Why is my first baseman not trying for that pop-up by first base. Why Won't my shortstop throw to first? I dunno? And what is up with the pointless replays? I dunno how many more times I can watch a guy run halfway to first...At least you can turn those off, unlike the boring announcer I think they brought back from a genessis game. Anyway..If you like a baseball game where you have no control over the fielders, pick up ""Baseball"" for the NES...Trust Me"
2,Horrible Baseball Game,"This game was fun for the first two full games I played, since then it has been more fun being used as a frisbie.Sega failed to include some critical aspects begining at the core - player controlled fielding. They also failed in the multiplayer aspects of the game. I have two roomates, therefore most of our game playing is done in a multiplayer mode. Sega failed to allow the user to play any part of season play out in multiplayer mode, thus if you are looking to collect stats on a given team you must either play by yourself or grab a pencil and scorebook and track them yourself.They also failed to include some key elements of other successful baseball games (i.e. homerun contest, batting practice, etc..)Overall I think this game was rushed to be produced, and Sega felt the great graphics (which are truely great) would carry this game over its many flaws.To those considering a purchase: wait till next year..."
3,Mixed blessings...,"This game certainly offers its share of disappointments, especially when compared to NFL2K or NBA2K. You can't make double-switches. Pitchers don't need rest between games. Too little in the way of statistics. Baserunning can be a huge annoyance, especially during infield pop-ups. The documentation is badly lacking.All that being said, this is still a thoroughly enjoyable game, mainly thanks to the AI. Batting -- which was so frustrating at first I almost snapped the disk in two -- turns out to offer some sublime pleasures. It's not merely a coordination contest -- you really have to work the count and make guesses about pitches. Pitching can be a lot of fun, allowing you to really work the corners or make a batter look silly with a well-placed fastball.This is not as polished a product as the other Dreamcast sports titles, but then again, NFL2K is arguably the best sports game ever created. A more-than-decent game, leaving me optimistic for 2K2..."
3,WS Baseball disappoints sim fans & delights arcade fans,"If you like very arcadey baseball games this may be your cup of tea. The game is exactly like the Sega Arcade baseball game. It is basically a pitcher/batter duel. There is no option to control the fielders until they catch or field the ball (automatic pilot 'til they retrieve the ball), the commentary is very generic and lifeless compared to games like Triple Play or, even, All Start Baseball, the replays are short and you can't decide when to run a replay (the game decides). The graphics are, for the most part, beautiful, though the crowd is 16 bit looking. The bottom line is that if you prefer baseball sims stay away from this game; if you prefer arcade Baseball games this is a good choice for you."
5,baseball fan,"OK, all the hardcore gamers are tough on this game and that's cool. From a baseball fan's point of view I thought this game was great. You can play against the teams you always wanted to beat. Red Sox vs. Yankees, Roger vs. Pedro OH YEAH! Like all games it takes a while to learn but once you have the basics down I think you will have a ball. Best part...you can put yourself in the game. So, big deal I struck out at Fenway Park. I was right into the game and had a ball. What can I tell you...PLAY BALL!"
4,Good game,"This is a good game, but not as good as the hype would indicate. I suggest renting this one first, so you don't feel like you've wasted your money. People who love baseball will no doubt enjoy this game and all it has to offer in the way of realism, but it's not the type of game you can just pick up and enjoy right away. It has to grow on you."
5,omg its the best game,"well i just played this game and it is awsome. its has great graphics, and very realistic. If i could pick one game this summer 2 get for dreamcast it would be this one no doubht about it. belive me get this game or ull be crying cause u didn't get it."
1,WSB2K1,"No fielding, no homerun derby, no fun. This game is all looks. If that is what you are looking for, then by all means, waste your money. On the other hand, if you want a all-around great baseball game, this is not it. You don't control your fielding, timing your swing is very difficult, pitching is useless, and you can't configure your controler. I returned this game fifteen hours after I bought it, and it did not surprise the register clerk."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.,"Do not let your prejudice regarding Dreamcast's previous games cloud your thinking! This is a bad game! The new batting interface is somewhat intuitive, but the game doesn't even let you FIELD! Look at other reviews if you don't believe me! ....... Great Graphics do NOT equal Great Game! STAY AWAY!"
1,Do not buy it really stinks,Please don't get this game it sure aint worth any ten bucks heck I wouldnt pay 50 cents for it worst game I own
2,im so dissapoionted,well i gave the game 2 stars because of how it looks .... it LOOKS great........ but gameplay and well everything ealse about the game is horrable... there arnt enough words in the world to say how horrable this game is.
3,"Not a bad machine, but has some bugs!!","I really love my Panasonic DMR-E500HS DVD recorder, but it is not without problems. I've had several errors occur into the recording phase. Usually, with the pull of the plug and letting the unit reset, all worked fine after. I have had several problems with the TV Guide disappearing for days at a time, and even up about 4 months this past summer. I've owned my machine for 13 months. One issue I've had with my unit is the fact the right channel on input does not work. That means if I record from a VCR and want true stereo sound, I only get the left channel. It's been this way since I purchased it. It doesn't matter what input channel you use, the right audio track doesn't record into the unit. Beyond that, the unit is great for taping live television. I love the capacity on the hard drive."
5,Amazing!,Amazing Spiderman is amazing! I guarentee that if you read the first issue of this series you will not be able to put it down until it is finished!5/5 - story5/5 - artwork (John Romita Jr. never fails!)5/5 - great dialogue!This series will make anyone a spiderman fan!
3,Actually order the wrong Printer,This printer is old (I thought it was recently introduced by epson)Man....it uses the ink.... but does a good job printing...
4,I just got it...,"I just set up my new Epson Stylus 1280 printer. It works great with my iMac computer. The only drawback I can see is that I was looking for a printer that used separate cartridges, and this one doesn't. Otherwise, it prints beautiful pictures, although I like the ones I printed on the Matte paper better than the ones I printed on the Glossy paper. It prints great documents, too. I think I'll keep it, for awhile."
2,Save your $$,These inkjets are OK but you can get superior results at a cheaper cost by taking your digital images to someplace like Walmart or CVS or Walgreens. Ink is way over-priced and the photos are not as good as what you can get elsewhere.
1,Not for Macs,"This cross-platform printer works fine with Windows. However, its Mac drivers are near useless. The prints are off center and the images fill 2/3 of a sheet. There are no layout options with the Mac drivers. I have written Epson 5 times - no response. I spent $15 for useless Epson Support. Mac users - look elsewhere!"
4,Large Format - Small Budget,"The 1280 may be showing some of it's age in terms of technology, inks, and some other areas (...) This is a fairly decent printer with only a few quirks for the money and in terms of quality with bang-for-the-buck nothing touches it in it's current price range."
1,DO NOT BUY! Epson has no plan to update drivers!,"WARNING. DO NOT BUY. EPSON DOES NOT SUPPLY DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS VISTA. CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE. BUY AN HP, You'll have much better luck and quality is better."
1,Nothing but problems,"I've hardly had a decent print from this printer. I only bought it for cheap color prints, not photos, but it's not even good enough for a birthday card. Streaks, fine breaking lines, wildly inaccurate colors: in short, lots of wasted paper and I was completely ripped off. I bought this printer new and I've used every kind of paper. Works better with Epson's abusively expensive inks, but it's cheaper to ship out work to Kinko's or wherever for printing."
1,Epson 1280,"The machine was advertised as ""Used, like new"". In fact, it was in very bad shape.1. The print head rattled around like an old trolley when running.2. It would not respond correctly to commands from the computer.3. It was packed very poorly (shook loose in the box with minimum packing materials).I have had this same Epson printer in the past and it was a good printer and worked well for a long time."
1,A printer don't work,First of all I don't get all the parts in the first shipment. The printer never work and I found debre down in the printer. I have contact the seller by e-mail about 7 days and havn't gotten a response. I can't give this seller any stars because I bought a printer that don't work and not getting any response from the seller. I wouldn't but any thing from this seller and suggest other to do the same.
3,Good but not great,"When this printer was introduced about 3 years ago it was clearly the best printer in its class. The prints looked nearly as good as lab prints, and the large format and built-in roll feeder gave options available nowhere else. But compared the best of today (Canon), the Epson 1280 comes up short in print quality and cost of operation.Many people seem to complain about the multiple color ink cartridge, and blame that for the high ink consumption. I can say this is not true. Producing and marketing a three ink cartridge is no where near as costly as 3 times single-color cartridges. But Epson printers DO consume lots of expensive ink.Besides the cost, I have two complaints: 1) prints invariably have a reddish hue (even though I am using Photoshop with native color profiles), and 2) the management of the roll feeder is clumsy invariably wasting expensive paper."
2,why trick the buyers?,"I was so excited to finally see that the Steve Thompson 12"" mix I've had on import vinyl for years was finally showing up on CD...NOT QUITE. The case says it's the unreleased Steve Thompson 12"". It an EDIT, running 3:49, where as my full 12"" version runs 5:18. How exactly can they try and tell us that a version that runs 9 seconds longer than the album version is a 12"" version???So much for the perfect reissue."
2,"CUTE, BUT HARD","MY DAUGHTER (WHO IS 5) WILL BE GETTING A GAMEBOY FOR XMAS AND I DECIDED TO TRY ALL OF THE GAMES MYSELF SO I CAN SEE IF SHE WILL LIKE THEM AND IF THEY ARE TOO HARD. THIS GAME IS DEFINITLY NOT FOR 5 YEAR OLDS. THE PASSWORDS ARE WAY TO HARD AND LONG TO ENTER, EVEN FOR AN ADULT. YOU SPEND MORE TIME PUTTING IN THE PASSWORD SOMTIME THAN YOU DO PLAYING THE GAME. THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE THESE GAMES SHOULD CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY FOR A CHILD TO WRITE DOWN THE EXACT PASSWORD AND THEN INPUT IT BACK IN. THIS GAME HAS ALL TYPES OF ICONS FOR THE PASSWORD (LIKE HEARTS, SHOPPING CARTS, AND MANY OTHER PICTURE ICONS, NUMBERS & LETTERS) I COULD NOT EVEN PUT MY PASSWORD BACK IN AND I AM AN ADULT! MAYBE THE OLDER (10-12) GIRLS WOULD ENJOY THIS GAME?? IF THEY COULD FIGURE OUT THEIR PASSWORDS........"
2,"BORING, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",This game gets very boring playing the games over & over to advance to the next level. The passwords don't work as it says it will on page 30 of the instruction booklet that comes with the game. I am a 12 year old game player & the passwords for this game are very frusturating.Save your money & buy something else.
2,Totally Angelica,"This game is very difficult for a six year old to move to higher levels. The concept is good and the graphics are nice, but it is not age appropiate for a young child."
3,Fun and Frustrating,"Totally Angelica is fun but then there's the torment of fluffy's pinball game. Also there's that part of the game where you have to save the password. I never save my password because: 1. it's takes too long to type it back in, and 2. it's takes too long to write down! i liked picking out the fashions, playing the mini games, and getting the scores from the judges. but for people who get frustrated easily, DON'T SAVE YOUR PASSWORD!"
4,A great story showing the struggles of a young reporter,"I was forced to read this book for one of my journalism classes and I had the 'typical' student attitude: 'I will skim through this book and guess my way through the paper'. I decided to read the first and last chapters of the book to get a basic understanding and then skim the rest. I started the book and realized that I could not put it down. This language in this book was very natural and the stories that were told were interesting. Being a journalism student, I was fasinated seeing all of the hardships that Baker went through to become the famed reporter that he is today. For once an assigned book that was actually interesting and worth reading."
4,"The sequel to ""Growing Up"" doesn't disappoint","While I was ""forced"" to read ""Growing Up""--part one of Russell Baker's autobiography--by my high school English teacher, I anxiously sought out this sequel. Baker's descriptions of the everyday life of a reporter makes for an intriguing book. While he has a tendency to romanticize situations, Baker provides enough details to give a clear picture of the type of challenges that reporters constantly face, especially early on in their careers. Baker's writing style is clean and straightforward without being simple. (I would zip through 20-30 pages at one sitting without even realizing it.) This is one of the few books I've read more than once and boy, do I wish he'd write another ""chapter"" of his autobiography. If you like the so called ""adventures"" of a reporter, an effortless history lesson, and lots of behind-the-scenes stuff, buy this book."
1,Misleading,"The two wine glasses were for sake, which is not mentioned on the Amazon website. While I will be fine with the glasses, they will not be used for a cabernet. I don't believe this was Riedel's fault, as the packaging is very clear."
5,A wonderful glass for sake drinking,I learned about this product from John Gauntner's Sake newsletter. This ia a wonderful set of glasses for nihonshu. This glass was designed to bring out the gentle nuances of sake and has achieved that goal. The glass can hold a significant amount of sake which I prefer to more traditional small o-choko and its size makes swirling easier. The glasses are stemless which allows for easier cleanup in a dishwasher and keeps with Japanese aesthetics. This glass has become my favorite glass for sake tasting and for general purpose sake consumption.
4,Adorable Puppy,I thought that this was the cutest little stuffed dog. It comes with a comb and its little bows in its hair are adorable and make it look just like my real Maltese puppy. ITs hair gets messed up really easy so you have to comb it a lot but over all it's adorable and from far away it looks real.
5,excellent product,"Theragear is the only fitness company I could find online that manufactures 20-pound vinyl-coated dumbbells. Body Solid goes up to 15 pounds in vinyl and all of the other companies end their vinyl sets at 10 pounds, which is pretty light if you have been exercising or lifting weights with any consistency. I vastly prefer the feel and look of vinyl over the traditional cast iron dumbbell and even the neoprene-coated versions. Vinyl feels good in your hands while you are working out and looks nice sitting on the floor afterwards. The grip is thicker than a standard iron dumbbell, which makes these a lot more comfortable during your workout routine. These are very durable, too. Get yourself a pair of these babies and you will look forward to doing your curls and other dumbbell exercises."
3,Not very small,I purchased the gloves and they have very long fingers and dont fit right. so my kids fingers are like only filling half of the room so she pulls them right off.
2,service wasn't to good,When I ordered the gloves..I ordered two pair and I got only one and got no answer when I ask about them They where not as long as I thought they showed..but I got one pair
3,Too small,Arrived in a timely manner but they were much smaller than I anticipated. I ordered the largest size and they did not fit my 9 year old slender daughter. Other than size problem I thought the quality appeared good and I liked that they had some stretch in them.
3,Fit 5 yr old great,"Got for a small 5 year old. These fit just below her elbows. The material was just okay, kind of knotted up from only one wear. Luckily, she just needed them for the one event. They are going to be good for playing dress up. Hard to find plain gloves like these, most have buttons or a princess embroidered on them."
5,This Toy is Really Great,"The Toa Heroes of Mata Nui now come as Lego technic Action figures Onua is my favorite because he can climb and hold sticks and fences You can also drive de claw by rotating the wheel behind him I suppose you all buy it because I spend the whole day playing with it and creating new stuff It's Fun, Durable and it's educational because it make the children all with soaring imagination! Congratulations Lego!!! There is also Lewa, Tahu, Kopaka, Gali and Pohatu Ps: I bought 4 pohatus because they can kick rocks just like a soccer game!!!"
5,High kicking machine.,"when i first got pohatu i thaugt thathe was going to be easy to build andboring to play with from the picture,but it took me about 7 minutes to build himand it was realy fun to play with.Evenpeaple say tahu is the coolest i think pohatu is cool because his mask stayson his face and his kick can knock the mask offof another toa just like that!His mask is very cool and even if his body is up side down its better that way becauseif his body was normal like the othershis legs would be all tangled up whenhe kicks.I think this toy is very educational because it shows younger kids how gears work.Out of all toas pohatu is the most durable because,well all of his body parts stay where they were placed his mask also stays on better than all the others,very fun forpeaple who like legos,I'm a teen and Ithink thease things are cool especiallyPOHATU."
4,Fun to Play with even after a Whole Decade,"To start off talking about Toa Pohatu Mata, the set itself is made up of legos near its bottom that allows Pohatu to kick his rock--which comes with the set itself--with the turn of a gear on the back. Out of all the toa released in 2001, this one sticks out with its upside-down body. Thanks to this placement, Pohatu can do what no other toa can do: kick something with his stone shoes.Apart from his famous lower appendages, the whole of Pohatu's figure itself is very unique in its own way. The only real downsides I could think of the figure were his stubby arms; however, his feet make up for this disadvantage.Overall, I would recommend this even to people today. LEGO Bionicle 8531 Pohatu is much better than any of the legos you will find on the market today and it definitely deserves to rest on the shelf of a hard-core bionicle collector."
5,THE BEST TOY OUT THERE!,I LOVE THESE TOYS. I only have one but but I'm hooked. Pohatu is my favorite. I think Lego bionicle are the best toys out there and also............they're affordable!
4,Superb comedy-drama of a famous family's history,"A compelling and hilarious story of a Jewish family come to prominence in Canada. Based on the Bronfman family (I'm sure many of these elements were lost on this American), the story is beautifully written in a classic style, but thoroughly up-to-date in its irony and wit. The characters are unforgetable and the pace quick."
1,"Squirrel bait, not....",Squirrels are not attracted to it. We have mny squirrels in our area and non of have taken the bait.
4,moose gift,got this for person who loves moose for Christmas. She was tickled to get it & recognized immediately that it was a moose although when i 1st opened it it was upside down & i was wondering what i got!
4,A Little Pigeon Toad,This book was purchased for the enjoyment of young elementary school children. We have 3 others in the classrom by Gwynne and the children love the play on words in all of his books.
2,Did anyone fact-check this book?,"I just received this book. The second school profile I turned to (Stanford University) was completely botched. While the narrative text seems to be about Stanford, the sidebars full of statistical information is obviously not related to Stanford. I have no idea what school it belongs to - but it lists Stanford as a ""public"" institution with an in-state tuition of just a few thousand dollars annually. I wish. Lucky for me I knew enough about the school to recognize these patent errors.Now I am left to wonder what other information in this book is completely off the mark? Everything else I have read seems to fit what I know about the schools, but I don't know that much about many of the schools reviewed."
2,Corrections please,"The obvious errors in key data on Stanford undermine this book's credibility. What other errors are also in the book?I have been requesting from Princeton Review/Random House a full listing of corrections, but they are silent.It's too bad, because this was becoming my favorite guidebook. The rankings are engaging, and I particularly like the underlying message: selectivity is not the same as quality. Some great schools are not super-selective; and some super-selective schools may not provide a top education to undergrads."
2,"Same old, same old","I think that this book is, well, too full of receycled information, myths, stereotypes, and other questionable descriptions. If you want hard data - go the internet, preferably individual school's web sites. If you want a comprehensive directory to colleges, Barrons is better."
5,"Best 361 Colleges, 2006 (College Admissions Guides)","I am a High School Counselor. This book is a part of my professional library. Good review of colleges, when used with other review books. You can never count on just one book."
5,A good starting point,"The ""Best 361 Colleges"" by Tom Meltzer is a good starting point. I always recommend this amongst the other more general reference type catalogues. For those who are more ambitious and are interested in not only the college surroundings and academic aspects, but also in a totally free education and in leadership education to go along with their major, I always also recommend West Point. And, for those who are interested, I recommend reading ""West Point Thomas Jefferson and Character Leadership Education"" by Norman Thomas Remick."
4,The bellhop teapot on the cover is available for sale.,"I purchased ""The Eccentric Teapot : Four Hundred Years of Invention by Garth Clark for my wife who collects teapots. Her collection is limited to handmade signed-by-the-artist teapots and teapots of unique (you could call eccentric) designs. I gave her the book Christmas morning. Throughout the day she briefly skimmed the photographs and histories of truly unusual teapots. Then after dinner I gave her one more present that was ""forgotten"" in the morning unwrapping rush. She was DELIGHTED to see that I had given her an exact replica of the bellhop teapot pictured on the cover! What a great way to top an already impressive gift for the teapot collector! She now displays the book and teapot together. I bought the teapot from the CIRCA Catalog. (800) 755-0403. I haven't seen the teapot in the catalog recently, so I don't know if it's still available."
3,Works but found it harder to use then I would have expected,"I had been using the inert gas spray (Wine Preserve) for my open bottles of wine, but that was expensive. I just bought this and it does what I want, keeps my red wine fresh for 3 days. You simply put the rubber cork in the wine bottle top then put the pump on top and pump it 10-15 times until you hear a click indicating most of the air is out. The corks can be rinsed off occasionally and they include 2 which is more then enough. The problem I find is that if there is 2/3 of a bottle left, it takes about 10-15 pumps until you hear the click saying it is done, but when there is only 1/2 of a bottle, it takes me 30-40 pumps and is extremely tiring to the point I just give up."
5,Great,"Works well - bottle of red in fridge still fine after 4 days, mind you I'm not expert. Nice system where it clicks to tell you when you have achieved vacuum. Nothing not to love."
3,serves the purpose,"you have to really pump hard to get the last ""drop"" of air out of the bottle ... I like the principle, just wished you wouldn't have to work so hard."
5,Great for the one glass a day drinkers,We enjoy a glass of wine but it takes several days to finish a bottle so this little gadget is a money saver for us.
5,It just works,"Product works as advertised, easy to use, easy to re-use as needed. Now instead of buying smaller bottles of wine, we can go big :-)"
3,"Good Product, Bad QC","Very good product idea. The stoppers work well. I had to purchase a second pump because the first one that I had literally fell apart one day while I was using it. The new pump does not have the same draw as the first so now I have to pump like mad to get the stoppers to ""click"" and tell me that the vacuum is sufficient. This is a sign of poor quality control at the pump manufacturer. If they were able to obtain pumps of good quality, this would be a great product."
4,It does what it is supposed to,"I revacuums the wine just like its supposed to. It doesnt stop oxidation really, just slows it down. I would need a carbon dioxide maker to top off the wine with before vacuum sealing it if I really wanted perfection. Fortunately for me I usually drink the whole bottle and seldom need this. But when I do use this is works. But be weary, if you so much as look at this thing the wrong way or breath too hard, the seal looses its vacuum and pops off."
4,good solution when you don't finish the bottle,Good product to save the wine for a week or two. It may not work for longer periods.
5,The best wine saver I've used thus far,"This is the third one that I buy. One for home, one for my parent's home, and one for our country home. It seems to be the most practical and inexpensive wine saver around. Make sure you get the new model with the 'clicking' sound. Although not essential, it lets you know when to stop pumping."
4,Effective!,"Highly recommended for wines sensitive to oxidation. Great for preserving reds. Not for use on sparkling wines of any kind, though."
5,Vacu Vin Wine Pump with two stoppers,"This is a solid product and can be used for many other bottled items other than wine. Top of all carbonated bottles such as beer, club soda, and champagne. In my opinion it easily doubles the life of opened wine and triples the life of opened carbonated drinks. It's also fairly cheap to get additional stoppers and all you need is one pump."
5,Wonderful Tool,"Works really great to keep the wine alive and tasty, great buy.Wish I had seen this item before this time."
3,Works pretty well,"This seems to work well for removing air from wine bottle in order to make it last longer. It is supposed to make a click sound when the optimum amount of air is removed from the bottle, but have only heard the click once or twice in a few weeks."
1,Do not buy,"After having several wine preservers of this type, we purchased this product. The brand we received was completely different than the description and the item and stoppers look nothing like the picture. The stoppers are cheap and too stiff to maintain a seal. The pump has sharp edges on the handle and is ineffective at removing much air from the bottle. Most certainly a bait and switch cheap knock off from an Amazon supplier. We are returning this item immediately."
1,Disappointment,The vacu vin stopper I got IS NOT the same that is on the picture... I feel kind of deceived as the substitute one looks very cheap and doesn't work at all. Can provide pictures if you don't believe me.
1,It broke during my second usage..,"This product seems really nice and useful, yet it done not last for more than 1 usage.. It is a disposable product. Highly NOT recommended!"
1,shoddy version of the original,"It doesn't seal anything like as well as the old ones. And the pump broke down after a year of use.This is the second brand new Vacu Vin that has died on me in as many years.With decent food vacuum systems a dime a dozen these days, I'm not going to be wasting my money on this company's products anymore."
4,"Great Vacumn, crummy new stoppers","Have had these for years, the old style stoppers would stay in even if the bottle fell over. The new ones have almost no retention compared to the old because they no longer have the ridges of rubber along the male part. I bought the new ones because I needed more, and do use them when I have lots of bottles open, but they suck."
4,Works so far!,"I bought this because my old wine pump was absolutely terrible and could not keep any wine fresh, even for a day. This pump is much better and for $10.00 it is an exceptional value. I only gave it four stars though for two reasons (but this may only apply to my pump): There is never a ""click"" sound to let me know that it is finished. I always just pump until I am sure all of the air is out. Also, I read a few reviews stating that the wine stays fresh for a week or more. That is definitely not true. In my experience it only keeps the wine fresh for about 3-5 days max. These are only minor complaints though and for the price I still think it is a great buy!"
2,It Broke :(,"I used this maybe 6-7 times. I honestly didn't abuse it or use it roughly. I loved it!! up until I used it just moment ago and the top piece of the pump completely cracked and popped off. What on earth?! I am very disappointed... from reading other reviews I feel this must be an isolated event? My mom has one of these and loves it. Not sure what I could have done. I am very sad, though. :("
3,"Easy to use, but vacuum breaks","For some reason, the vacuum doesn't hold on the bottle. I've come back later to find that the vacuum is gone, and the bottle is not as good. I don't think the seal is 100% all the time. It's easy to use, and if you will drink the bottle quickly, it will work"
4,Works as advertised,The rubber stoppers that come with this pump are very high quality and does the job. The pump seems a bit flimsy but works well.
5,I like this,"I've used this item several times and find that it works as advertised. Put the rubber stopper in, use the ""T"" handle to expel the air from the bottle until you hear the 'click' and you're good to go."
5,gift for sonny,Got this for the boy... so he wouldn't feel obligated to drink the whole bottle at one sitting. It does the job and he's not hungover as much.
5,Not here yet,"I have these for myself. This is a gift for a friend. I absolutely love my Rabbit opener and this wine saver, just in case we don't drink the whole bottle every time !Great deal and wonderful gift, I hope."
5,Wine Saver,I only used the product once but it worked fine. If you don't finish the bottle it gives the wine extended life.
5,Perfecto,This wine pump is a significant improvement over their previous moedel: the clidking sound it makes once the air has been drawn out is a wonderfully helpful feature.
4,It does the job,I bought this to keep the fizz in my open bottles of wine and other beverages. It does the job well. It is easy to use and it holds the pressure well. A nice addition to any kitchen or bar.
5,Vacu Vin 0981450 Wine Saver Vacuum Wine Pump with 2 Stoppers,"These things are great! I use it to degas my wine. I have never used it on single bottles, but I sure it would work well for that purpose too. Great value!"
5,Vacu Vin,The pump and stopper seal the bottle very well. It did well mainting vacuum with a week between use and I'm assuming the same performance for longer time frames.
5,Great!,"I was so happy with this product I bought another one for Mother's Day. The perfect way to reseal a bottle of wine if you aren't finishing it. Since I am the only wine drinker in our house I often hesitate to open a new bottle for fear of it going bad. Never again. Easy to use, easy to remove and hold the pressure quite well. So glad I discovered this!"
5,Works great,"I've had several different brands of pump/stopper kits and this one is as functionally effective as any if not more so, plus it has the very nice ""clicking"" feature - it's easy to under-estimate and in particular over-estimate how much pumping is required to extract all the air. So the clicking feature not only adds convenience but effectiveness as well. As others have suggested, although not mandatory, moistening the stopper does help to make the vacuum seal. No issues with pump performance or longevity (but have only had the product for a few weeks)."
1,Stoppers do not hold negative pressure,"The Vacuum devise is better than my others (I have one in each of our homes), but, as the pictures illustrate, the sharp angle on the stoppers does not allow the stopper to seal over a long enough area of the bottle neck to hold. The negative pressure is gone in an hour or so. I am going to try and order different stoppers, but it would be cheaper to order a different model."
5,Lovely addition to our hallway~,"I wanted a casual, yet elegant mini chandelier to put at the end of our hallway, and this is exactly what I hoped for. Not an over-the-top fancy piece, but understated and pleasing to the eye. It was a bit more expensive than I thought it should cost, but at least I really like it. Would recommend for a small room, hallway, bathroom etc. Won't work in a larger area as it's quite petite."
2,basic mom,"This was a cute idea, however the product is not made very well. The stamps are on squares of rubber w/ adhesive backing. The backing doesn't hold all that well and some have peeled off/fell off on occasion, the stamp characters aren't raised off their base very high and the ink isn't very... potent. So when you try for ink on the stamp you need to work to coat the ink on and when you stamp, you have to press so hard to get the character to fully transfer. When you press hard enough to do so, you get a back ground of the square stamp on your paper from the base stamping the paper. My 4 year old daughter isn't interested in using them as stamps as they ""didn't work""; however she frequently likes using them as wood blocks for building things. Overprice for underquality."
4,The Great Whale of Kansas,"I like the book so far,because in the story it tellsabout a young boy in his backyard and,they are pucifect.My best part is that when he is digging,and he discoverspreserved in the cretaceous lime stone is more than spectiacular.The U.S.Mail the setting of the story is Highley Park,theconflict is a fossil that is five-foot musasaur the characters are,Phile,Miss.Whistle,Chief Wah-Shum-Gah."
2,Meh,"I wish that they had said up front that it did not come with a charger or battery. You are literally just buying a camera with nothing else, this would have been fine if it hadn't also been in crappy condition. You could still see where someone had written on it in marker, and it had scratches on both the screen and the camera itself. I'm not sure what I expected when I paid so little for it though. You get what you pay for, so if you want a decent camera just pay for a good one."
5,Lighthearted mystery,"Anything Considered was so much fun to read. It was a mystery that in another author's hands might have been dark and sinister. There were a lot of twists and turns that I was not expecting, and in some places I laughed out loud.The descriptions of the South of France and the food the hero of the story eats are fantastic. They made me want to pack up and visit the South of France right away, and if I had to deal with some unsavory characters in order to go there, I would be more than willing to do it."
3,Shallow Tale Of Scamps & Models In European Truffle Caper,"While I found the story and the characters to be sexist and ridiculous, I really enjoyed Mayle's style of prose. He seems a clever chap, writing bad American genre fiction for motivations that I hope are merely financial. Tim Curry's voice livens the tale up a bit as well, doing right-on accents (except the Japanese one) of every sort of ethnicity, and adding a definite verve and maybe an itty-bitty smirk to the text. Overall, listening to this story on my walkman as I drudged away at work brightened up the day considerably."
2,Not as good as earlier work,"Peter Mayle appears to be resting on his previous popularity. This book was trite, amateurish and actually too silly. It had none of the characterization and atmosphere of A YEAR IN PROVENCE. He should stick with what he knows."
2,Ian Fleming beats Peter Mayle every time!,"Goldfinger and Dr. No are alive and kicking...Peter Mayle borrows shamelessly from both, substituting truffles for gold, a Japanese henchman for a Korean one and on and on. Loved A year in Provence (though the TV version of it was dreadful): Peter Mayle, you should stick to what you know best: all the atmosphere and the charm of Provence is there -- even truffles -- and its so much better"
2,Clean up your plate and skip the script.,"As a fan of Peter Mayle's previous, sensual, shared experiences of the food and atmosphere of Provence, I had great hopes for this book as I tucked it into my pack for a hiking trip. Alas, I was dreadfully disappointed. Scattered remembrances of wonderful wines and food are plopped on top of a pathetic outline for a bad action movie. It is as if Mr. Mayle's literary agent said...""Peter...enough of the wine and food, give me a superficial vehicle for Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, and Pierce Brosnan and I'll give you enough money to re-roof that monstrosity of a house ten times over!"" Please Peter. Come back to us. We don't need ham-fisted attempts at action or movie sex. Your thoughtful, amusing insights into French life were wonderful; we miss you"
3,mind candy,"Not a serious book at all, nor was it apparently written to be ""serious"". The plot is rather fanciful, at times a bit unbelievable, but I suspect the author knew that."
4,I don't know why you guys hate it so much,"This CD is not terrible, get your heads out of the gutter, or open your mind just a little. If you are looking for an album with tight ass breaks mixed flawlessly, then this is a great set. If you like his set from Dave Seaman's Therapy Sessions you should like this! The Therapy Sessions track selection is a little better, which is why i gave this 4 stars, but it's still a must hear. if you are a fan of Phil K then you should not miss out on this. I honestly do not think this album deserves 1 star. This is his style, and the songs kick. I have listened to it plenty of times and it's really grooving. From dark funky breaky beats to some great breaky vocal sampling tracks. Try it! I know I'm not the only one that thinks this. I play this CD in my living room when I have people over sometimes and everyone loves it and always asks, ""Who is this? It's so tight."" PHIL K I say! ;D"
4,Good mix.,"Sounds good to me. Great mix and something different from Y4K.Dark, electro and some sweet breaks."
3,Overall OK but has a couple GREAT tracks,"Definitely not the worst of the Y4k releases, not the best either. It's got a couple GREAT tracks on it that are worth the price of the cd alone."
4,sounds great!,"i have not played a reeded instrument since i was in high school about 15yrs ago. though some of the fingerings are not too difficult trying to get use to the proper finger positions i am going to have to just get us to. one problem i am running into is how the blow and lip the mouth piece properly. though i am new to the zaphoon its a lot of fun to play and the sound of the instrument appeals to me. anyone that has played a reeded instrument before would enjoy this instrument i believe. there is a good learning curve i have found out but that just goes along with doing something new, so buy one and go have some fun learning a instrument."
2,glorified recorder with a fat mouth piece,"This ""instrument"" is very difficult to play due to the hugly fat mouthpiece which does not allow a normal woodwind type bite on the reed. not what it was made out to be!"
1,Quite a disappointment,"Since I play the saxophone I thought this would be fun and easy to take along for practice on the road or to make music for my granddaughter to dance to.Try as I might, I can only get one squawking note from the Xaphoon.Manipulating the finger holes make absolutely no change in tone.Not sure if I got a flawed product or if they are all this way.Pay your money, take your chances, but it didn't work at all for me."
2,THIS IS AGREAT PURCHASE MY SON IS ON MUSIC AND IS GREAT,This was one of those great purchase I did for my son since the day I got this unit he was so happy that made my day this a great piece for music thank you for doing what others company can't do great stuff great prices good job
3,Cute little gizmo,"This is a fun little instrument. However, I'm not sure anyone's going to want one professionally. Also, I'm not sure that it captures the novelty of the original bamboo instrument (though I give it credit for trying). Part of me wants to think that the conversion to plastic might have been a good time to maybe switch over to a more standard fingering of a recorder. As it is, it's got nothing at all in common with a saxophone other than the tenor reed.That said, I've had some fun with it. I also own a ukulele and consider that to be a good sort of backpacking instrument like the Xaphoon and I have the same general impression of instruments in that class. I'm not disappointed with my purchase. I just think it might have been ported to plast a little differently."
2,Right now its a 2 Star,"I had one of these clocks before, and it accidentally was damaged after having no problems with it for a few years. I like the clock and wanted to replace it, so I was happy to find the exact same one on Amazon. Sorry to say I am now returning it because it will not keep time. I tried different batteries, and it still loses time. Amazon is shipping me another. If that one works, I will upgrade my rating. I love the color of this clock and it's perfect for in my laundry room."
1,It arrived broke!,The big hand just dangles loose. It was broke right out of the box. I should have purchased a cheaper clock that i know that works from target!
1,Photo Protector Pages,"What was pictured was not what I received. However, I did send them back and received a credit for the incorrect sheets"
5,Interesting and Different!,"The US lacks a lot of British independent films unfortunately. That being said, this is one of the ones that the US is REALLY missing out on!A ""guy flick"" through and through, it has borderline ridiculous violence, plot twists, great dialogue, and other facets that will keep you entertained. Do yourself a favor and add this to your DVD collection immediately!"
2,Just another dumb crime film.,"I found the main protagonist, and almost all the other characters, so unlikeable that it was hard to get into the film. I couldn't feel any empathy toward Carlton or care about what happened to him. It's the story of a large brutish thug who grows to become... a larger, more brutish thug. And there's really not much of a compelling story here, the conflict seems there only to set-piece moments of violence. There's no growth with these people, no one learns anything. It's kind of like watching a documentary about someone horrible, but with no narrator to provide subtext or to dig for deeper meaning you're left with watching this horrible guy do horrible things for two hours, which gets pretty boring."
5,Above average gangster flick.,Better than I thought it would be. If you like UK Gangster Flicks this one is pretty good.
1,Waste of money,"I have owned this sprouter for several years, and used it 3-4 times per year. I have had awful luck with it. Everytime the sprouts start to grow (after 3 days or so) they start to mold. I have run it through the dishwasher, used spring water and filtered water and no luck. I have even called the company and they told me I am using to much water? This answer was not helpful as I can grow sprouts in a sprout bag or quart jar fine.Save your money and buy a sprout bag or use a mason type jar."
4,Great sprouter!,"I bought this sprouter a year ago and it took me some time to get the best out of it. I use it for green sprouts (alfalfa, clover, broccoli), grains (wheat, spelt, buckwheat) and lentils.It is also great for sprouting teff (the smallest grain): just sprinkle 1 tablespoon and wet just a little (don't water too much because it won't drain: teff will clog the hole), wait until it starts sprouting and attaches to the tray (2 days) before rinsing it every day. A few days later it looks like grass and tastes sweet!It requires less hands-on time and less water than other sprouters, as it drips from one tray to the next. I give it 4 stars because the siphon caps sometime need to be tapped or removed for the water to drain and its capacity for grains and lentils is on the low side. I also own an EasySprout which is more versatile and has a larger capacity for grains and legumes, but I prefer the Biosta for the green sprouts, as they get better light exposure and all grow upright."
1,Marginal at best,"The sprouter is like a lot of others so to be fair the design is typical. The little red siphon caps color, (red), rubs off on your hands. The little siphon orfices don't drain well. The different trays are ""tippy"" in the base.The sprouts germinated fast. It is nice looking on the countertop. It really only needs two waterings for alfalfa, that was cool."
2,"Disappointing, with an irritating heroine","I wanted to like this book, being interested in the setting and time period. The plot had potential but the writing is stilted and the personality of the lead character makes no sense. I think the author was trying to make her appear conflicted and multidimensional but she seems naive to the point of social-retardation to me. Also, paraphrasing the book, another character calls Leigh a person who fits her times. Well, I thought just the opposite. She's judgemental, prudish, boringly-conventional, and completely out of place in the 1960s. For that reason and others, this book captures none of the magic and excitement of the time period in which it was set."
3,Beware of non-Media Blasters copies for sale,"This is a decent enough Italian urban warfare kind of flick,if you enjoy those kind of things, but if you're interested in it, beware of sellers that have extremely LOW prices because one in particular, that still has listings, sold me some cheesy knock-off that's not the item listed. It's a dub from a Media Home Entertainment TAPE, no less....so heads up, folks..."
3,Bronx Warriors,"The sequel is vastly superior to this cute mishmash of Escape From New york and the Warriors. However The late Vic Morrow and Fred Williamson steal the show.The standout scene is The Viking funeral sequence, apart from this it is unconvincing early 80s badly dubbed light entertainment. It is about as futuristic as Dr Who!The sequel has far more violence, better bad guys and the action is better staged."
3,"PRE-QUEL TO ""ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX""","I LIKE LOW-BUDGET ITALIAN FILMS AND THIS ONE IS OK BUT...THE DVD PACKAGE OF THIS REALLY SUCKS! THE PICTURE IS OK BUT THE SOUND IS SO LOW IT'S PATHETIC!! VIC MORROW PLAYS A GREAT ROLE AS A ROGUE COP/ASSASSIN...MARK GREGORGY IS GREAT AS ""TRASH"". I WOULD ONLY RECOMEND THIS TO DIE-HARD ITALIAN FILM BUFFS...(AND OTHERS WHO LIKE ACTOR FRED WILLIAMSON"
5,One of the Best Movies of the early 90's,"I must say The Bronx Warriors was one of the best movies i seen it starts out with the Trash and his gang pull up on there bikes and get the fighting with a rival gang, and of course Trash Gang wins the battle,Trash weapon is so tight,Fred Williamson is a king in this movie,one of my favorite parts of the movie is when Trash and some of the guys find one of there's friends chain and hangin,then this gang called The Scavengers jump out and the fight yet again is on of course Trash had 2 get pay back for what they did to there friend and after the fight Trash watch his best friend die, i can go on and on bout the whole movie but i recommend you check this flick out 4 real guarenteed you'll get your money worth.......also check out1.Escape from the Bronx2.The Warriors3.Warriors of the Wasteland4.Escape from New York5.Escape from L.A6.Original Gangsters"
4,Nursing Case Studies,"This book is the wrong version of a book I didn't realize I already had; however, the case studies are very helpful when it comes to study for my nursing exams."
1,Waist of Time,"I'm a factory certified HD Service Tech. This wrench is a hard to find yet essential time saver for doing a speedo sensor on a sporty. Mac Tools carries one, you can order it online or even through Matco tools if you don't have any Mac guys around.After back and forth with Kastar because they did not send me a bit with the wrench, received the wrench within 5 days of ordering yet the bit nearly 4 weeks later, finally had the chance to use it at work and wouldn't you know it locked up within 5 turns of the wrench.Frankly; save yourself the headache, and don't waist your time. I'm not even returning this as I really don't care to deal with Kastar further."
5,Excellent Recipe Program,"I've always wanted to make my own recipes, but they seemed to come out just a little off. Thanks to this program, I now understand all the variables involved with recipe formulation. I'm now making the best beer I've ever made. Thanks!"
5,A Historical based Love story with Hamlet style revenge and intrigues,"China's best director (Feng Xiao-Gang), Best art director (Tim Yip), Best Martial Arts director (Yuen Woo-Ping), Best Music Composer/Director (Tan Dun), and Best actresses (Zhang Zhi-Yi and Zhou Xun), Best actor (Ge You), all get together to make this big casts, big expenditure movie in a extravagant and exquisite movie. The audience will enjoy the authentic Chinese costume, music, and conspiracies. The only minor complain of this movie is that the Love story, although beautiful, defies the traditional Chinese way of openly showing emotions."
3,weird,I thought this book had a weak start and got a little better towards the end but it was not the best book. I did like how much the book was factual and most parts were all in the Illiad
4,Very Cool,"This Drive is very cool. I installed the included pci card in a computer I built over 5 years ago and it works great.The only thing I don't like is there does not seem to be a way to control the hard drives ""sleep mode"" behavior. It goes in and out of sleep mode far to frequently; many simple tasks such as emptying the windows xp recycle bin are often delay several seconds due to this.Regardless, I still like the drive a lot."
5,eSATA PCI - E great for Mac,"This has been a great external drive for both my Mac and PC. I use if for a back up drive.I ordered a second one and hooked it up to my DirecTV box for a bigger hard drive (like I need to save any more TV shows). It is quiet, fast and easy to use."
5,Some of the best songs ever written by the Four Seasons,If you are trying to figure out what one of the four seaosons tapes to buy this is the one. These songs always seem to put me in a good mood.
5,"""Gold Vault"" is pure gold!","It's wonderful! I love every one of these songs! I especially like ""Betrayed"" and ""Cry Myself to Sleep."" I wonder why they didn't make it very big? And then, of course, I like ""Let's Hang On!"" and ""Rag Doll"" and all the other big hit songs. Buy it, buy it, BUY IT!"
3,An enjoyable fantasy,"It's hard to know what to say about this book. I enjoyed the novel, though I wouldn't say it was among the very best of fantasy. I was pleased that the author avoided some of the common fantasy pitfalls, like having the natives on another planet speek english or having a magic spell to give them the language.This is the story of David Shaw and Mrs Catlin, who on David's 18th birthday go into a cave and end up in the world of Shushuan. They get sold into slavery and things develop from there.(I won't tell you all the story -read it yourself:) The author has put together an enjoyable fantasy world and I'm happy to have read this book. There is also a sequel called ""beyond Freedom"" by the same author. If he writes any more in this sequence I'll probably read it. It's interesting to read a contemporary fantasy that originates in the UK and no the USA."
2,Didn't like it,"I got bored with this movie and could not even finish it. There is ignorance on both sides of the fence, whether in regards to the anorexic woman or the obese woman who doesnt understand you dont have to starve yourself to be thin. There is even a scene where the obese woman announces a fat acceptance walking group to her support group, and she is ridiculed because apparently walking means that you are caving into society's ideals of beauty. I guess being active and eating healthy means you hate yourself, according to those idiots. At times the movie seemed poorly filmed and the dialogue was overdone or overly boring."
5,Heartbreaking. A realistic peek inside the mind of disorders,"Allowing the audience a peek inside the very private world of compulsive overeating, anorexia and the accompanying thought processes that go along with each makes this movie something very special...If you eat food you should see this movie."
2,Eh.,"This movie was touching at points but overall I found it to be extemly annoying. An overweight woman wants to loose weight by ""learning"" how to become anorexic. I found it offensive and triggering. Be happy with who you are and if you're not happy with it then change it...the healthy way. I was anorexic and bulimic for a number of years and still struggle with it everyday. This is not a feel good movie."
4,Fascinating,"This book takes the reader inside the minds of two of histories most influential men, at the very peak of their powers and responsibilities. We see them try to gauge the political, cultural, and societal moods of their people, their allies, their armies, and the world as they figuratively stare across the English Channel at one another. I was surprised at Hitler's delaying what at the time seemed an inevitable attack on England, while his top Nazi advisers were pushing him to make a move. It was also interesting that during this extremely dangerous summer of 1940 Churchill had virtually stopped corresponding with Roosevelt. Apparently he thought his actions, like the bombing of the French Navy at Oran, would speak volumes to the hesitant Americans, and it did."
3,"The Good, the Bad and the Wario","I found this game incredibly frustrating. I'm about halfway through it, and I probably won't finiish. Don't be fooled by claims that this game is non-linear. While you can deviate a little in the order you do things, ultimately you can't progress in the game until you solve particular puzzles or beat particular bosses. And almost all the puzzles have only one solution.This being said, the graphics are gorgeous. By far the best I've seen on the GBC. The controls are good, the environments are varied, and there are stretches that are incredibly fun. Unfortunately, I just can't give it 5 stars like everyone else because I think the gameplay is too annoying."
5,GREAT GAME!,"This game is pretty cool and adventure packed as well... you can be overweight Wario, Vampire Wario, and also Snowman Wario"
3,Fun but gets boring after while,"Wario has exceptional graphics and addictive but somewhat annoyingly hard levels. It is very fun for the first and second time playing, but then the enjoyment kinda slips and it's boring. I'd give gameplay a 3, since you have to earn up special powers, which makes it possible to completely beat the level, but the wait is agonizingly long. Most bosses are fun to play against, adding to the fact you never no what they'll do, or where they could pop up. Graphics are a 3, Fun, 4. In conclusion, I'd advise this game for people who like slightly stupid and fat characters."
2,Test it Out Before You Bye it,"The front of this game is very misleading, because it makes the game look really cool. Even though Wario Land 3 has good graphics for gameboy color, it is not a very good game. You can't die, save in the middle of a level and somettimes you can't get back to normal after you've turned into something bad. Wario Land 3 is only good for a few hours and then you will wish you didn't get it. So, if you see a game you want, test it out first."
2,TOO complicated!,"I thought that it was going to be a good game, but it wasn't that good. Too complicated and frustrating levels."
4,Wario Land 3,"My son (age 6 1/2) and I paid for this game together. He thinks Wario Land 3 is very easy at the start but when you get near the end of an area, it is frustrating for him because he cannot get to keys that he can see on the screen. It is hard for him to find the treasure box that goes with the key sometimes. We did not realize this game would be so difficult. We have ""Wario Land - Super Mario Land 3"" and thought this game would be similar. We love the graphics and the sounds but the game is much more difficult in some places than we would have thought. We believe you would need to be at least 7 years old to play this game more successfully."
2,ok for some people.,"when i bought this game, i expected it to be full of action, as well as puzzles, but when i popped it into my gbc i was disapointed. unlike past wario or super mario games , there is no action, only very difficult puzzles. you are invinsible, which might seem cool at first but, no you have to get hit by a certain ememy to get some dumb power like being flat to solve a puzzle. i cant even get past the 3rd level, and i DONT suck at video games. only buy this game if you like puzzle platform games, my friend loves it. i gave it 2 stars because some people will like this, just not people looking to replace a real SUPER MARIO game, such as mario word or mario 64."
3,It is complicated and hmm...may be it worth,"I bought this game for about 2 months. I played it almost every day since then. It was fun, but very annoying when you couldn't pass the level. I bought a book to try to solve the problem. However, it didn't really work. So, if some one can help me in the Red Key level. I will be appreciated. here is my email address: eggy168@hotmail.com Thanks."
2,poles not included,"Product photo is inaccurate. While the description talks about needing to supply your own poles, the photo shows them attached to poles. The actual nets are fine, but this was misleading."
2,No poles!!,"I guess these work as nets, but beware, they do not come with poles. Never assume, you know what happens.................... And I did not see any poles that you can get for these. If anyone knows the answer to that one, please contact me!"
2,Disappointed,The net was much larger than what it looked on the website. It is very sturdy with a very short handle. I realized that I needed a handle after the net arrived. The size won't work for what I want.
4,frog net,The product was a great value for the money but does not fall into the category of butterfly net. It was tagged as a butterfly net. The net is too heavy and would damage the wings of a butterfly.
4,My favourite,"You can't beat the price! For this, you have all the tiny bottles of potions, broomsticks, pets, etc. The only thing that would have improved it would have been if the hats could have been large enough to actually fit on her head without having to make her bald first. Really, who takes off their hair to try a hat on? Otherwise the detail was great!"
1,"Oh... my god, what a dissapointment","I would never beleive it to be true. Yes I was waiting for the day that the Harry potter LEGO sets were realeased, I was dissapointed, from the looks of the box (I never bought it.) it looked like a few LEGO peices and some cardboard. but being the HP fan atic that i am, eventually I will probably purchase these items."
3,Coon Creek Girl,"Although an interesting booklet, most of the information here can be found on just about any album liner notes on the Coon Creek Girls and Lily May Ledford. It's a nice souvenir booklet. Overpriced for just thirty one pages and paperback. Google Lily May Ledford and see what the store in Berea, KY gets for the same booklet plus shipping. Much cheaper."
4,Fun! And educational!,This is an excellent companion to Kaplan and Saddock. I found the toxicology review particularly helpful. The questions are sometimes too detailed but very thought provoking. Good for any behavioral science/ psych course.
3,review,Fairly good book for residents in psychiatry who are preparing for PRITE or Boards. Almost no neurology.
4,"Good press, does NOT have the right spacers for Dana 30/44 axles.","I bought this because it specifically mentions Dana axles. As the Dana axles are angled where the ball joint is pressed in, you need a little angled spacer. The OTC part 7894 is $75 (plus the cost of the press), so I thought I'd go with this as a much less expensive option. It works, but no angled spacer. I ended up grinding an angle on one myself so it works, but for anyone working on Dana axles be aware of this. Its still a decent press, especially for under $100. I would buy again."
4,Excellent read,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It broke down to a simpler form many of the concepts and perceptions that I previously had in my reading of the bible. This book contained many reference scriptures that helped me to validate what the author was trying to convey. I would be recommend this book to many novices of the bible, or even an elder that needs to go back to the basics."
5,A Great Study Resource,This book is great! Has been used by several churches for new beginners in the christian faith. Awesome!
4,A poet may be saved by one poem only,"Lindsay had a difficult and tragic life. He tried to be a wandering American poet, some kind of combination of bard and entertainer. However as most who deal in the worlds of artistic creation know, money did not come easily. He too though at one point attaining great reputation for his poem ,""The Congo"" did not sustain this, and knew much negative criticism and rejection.In any case I know from way back one poem of his , included in this anthology, which I truly like though I have always found mystifying. It is one of his most well- known poems.'Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight"" I think on the basis of this poem alone, Lindsay is worth remembering."
2,thank god it's a 'thrift' edition,"I expected to really like Lindsay's poetry. I love Chicago and Chicago writers. Vachel Lindsay was a part of the ""Chicago Renaissance"" which included the poets Edgar Lee Masters (wrote the Spoon River Anthology, but I'm unfamiliar with his work) and Carl Sandburg, whose work I love. I had hoped with his association with Sandburg... Plus I had previously read ""Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight"" which is a superb poem. And ""The Congo"" has a great reputation. Lindsay's poetry just wasn't all that great--and I'm not saying that because of the performance pieces. I happen to like performance poetry, if it is well written (Marc Smith is a great example)--poetry is meant to be spoken. ... After all, he was part of the ""Chicago Renaissance."""
2,This isn't a movie. It's the 1st Season of WUD,"I just rented this and I didn't hate it until the end. It's low budget but it has some charm which is why I gave it 2 stars. The problem starts towards the end of the movie where you see that they are running out of time to wrap this up (and yes it slows to a crawl making you look at the time). After 80 minutes you find out (since I'd never heard of WUD or Crackle) that this is a web-series of 4 minute episodes strung together ending in a cliffhanger. Very disappointing.As others have mentioned if you love zombies...and who doesn't, you will be let down. If you like comedies, horror movies and/or a complete story...again you will be let down. If they think I will visit Crackle weekly for the next season of 4 minute episodes...*they* will be let down."
2,Sounded interesting until I watched it,Lame and boring. Seemed to drag on forever. There were a few entertaining scenes but overall I was amazed how boring this interesting sounding plot became. It is done in reality tv form. I love zombies but this blows. A genuine let down.
3,Disappointing,"After reading the VILLAGE OF HOMMLET module way back when, I thought the TEMPLE edition would be even better. It wasn't.VOH had context to the village . . . it breathed as if it were alive . . . there were little motivations on the side going on with the villagers and the dungeon was well thought out for a first level group.But, TOEE, was VOH plus the big trip to the temple. And, for the most part, I found TEMPLE to just be a room filled with different types of monsters. It was like this: kill monster, look for traps, get booty . . . repeat process.Wouldn't recommend unless your group is hack and slash only."
4,Worth it,"This is simple. I got through it in an afternoon. I'm a singer songwriter from Kentucky and got my head around what I need to do. Also, kind of funny--in a good way."
2,car parts,"I gave this a 2 star even tho I rated the felpro head set higher. In the felpro world in the past, usually a head set and a conversion set will take care of the whole engine on gaskets. Not so on this gasket set... in the past coversions sets came with timing cover gaskets...not so on this gasket set. Felpro needs to do some more homework on foreign oriented cars and their pan gaskets..."""""""" gaskets are not used on toyota 4 cylinders....grey RTV specifically for the pan and other uses also."""""""" is the choice."
3,Doesn't fully protect the USB connection,"This is a perfectly fine USB, and it is stylish looking, but it disappointed me because it doesn't really solve the problem it seem to imply it does. I thought from the picture that the rotating cap would replace the little plastic tip protectors that keep dirt and stuff from getting into the USB connection tip. But in fact the rotating cap just rotates over the tip without actually covering it - dirt can still come in easily between the cap and the base, and thus can still get into the USB connection."
1,Terrible physical design,"What looks nice in the picture is actually a horrible design.The plastic case you see in the picture, the part that has the ""diskGO"" written on it, is the part where you would connect a lanyard/keychain to. The part where the actual memory is in FALLS OUT very easily from this part. So then you have TWO parts in your hands (or on the floor) - the actual memory part and the grey/gray cover. NOT a very good idea AT ALL.So you'll be forced to keep this in your pocket, along with all the lint and dirt, and I'm not taking a chance on that. Mine will be heading to the trash as soon as I can find a product that has 1) data security, 2) not a history of failed data retrieval 3) the carrying hook in the main body, and 4) a cover for the USB connector that doesn't fall off."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,I purchased ten 99 cent flash drives from this company for a total of $9.99 and they charged me $51 in shipping costs. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.
1,Rip Off,I purchased fifteen of these 99 cent flash drives from this company for a total of $14.85 and they charged me $76.00!!! in shipping costs. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.
4,A good game,"I see all these people writing and saying it was too hard. Man, they must be crazy. Yes it's a challenging game but NEVER has a game been so fast! This is what pod racing should be! You won't fing a faster game on the dreamcast. Not only will you see all of the racers from the movie, which sucked, my opinion, but about 10 other racers with the craziest pod designs you could imagine. And the stages are so well animated, over 12 of them. And the options let you create the perfect pod racer. Well, upgrade the perfect racer at least. Look, if you buy this game, you won't be disappointed. But, if your saving for a PS2, wait for something more in depth. A game that the other ""gamers"" couldn't handle."
4,Great & Simple Racer,"This is a simple and very fast racer. The sense of speed is great and the graphics are ok.I like how the developers managed to create the feel of the POD racers from the movie.For the price, it is a good racer!"
3,It is not as good as the movie....,"It starts fun and it last for about an hour or so and then you get hot and restless and it gets old. It has a lack of nice tracks and they are either very easy or annoyingly hard. I was siked about it becuase I am a big star wars fan, but this game was just a plain diassapintment. I would say save your money and get a decent game with better graphics and more addicting game play."
2,Boring,It was fun for about two or three races after that it got very boring and very repetitive. Probably better for younger kids but older gamers will lose interest fast. Save your money. This game's a waste.
1,"Terrible!, Terrible!, Terrible!","This has got to be the worst game ever. I have nothing good to say about this game. The scenes, the graphics, the sounds, they are all BAD. Lucas should just stick to what he does best, Direct!!"
2,pod racing for children,"This game was fun at first but quickly became repetitive and boring. I was very disappointed. The graphics are not up-to-par with the other DreamCast games that I have played and all of the tracks were pretty much the same. I love video games, but not this one."
1,Horrible game,"Nothing is good about this game.The graphics are dull,the soundtrack is bad and over that the game's too boring.Don't understand what LucasArts are tryin' to prove by making such silly games.Don't blow your money away on this one.It's no use."
3,The Blurr problem,"Well, this is my first LCD monitor. It's a great improvement from a 15"" CRT that was almost 7 years old.Physically it is well built, it seems pretty sturdy, it has a nice design (compare to a viewsonic lcd monitor, they are ugly), the colors are bright and beautiful, but, but, but, this is the problem: when black text is displayed on white background, a ""shadow"" appears under the text making it blurry. If you are reading text, it becomes very eye-straining after a while.Pictures, movies and games, however, look great."
3,"OK, depending on your needs","As a new homeowner, I was looking for a book that would give me some basic information about perennials, including some good choices to add to my new garden. While this book certainly provides many varieties to choose from, I often couldn't find information on those perennials that were already in my yard! Definitely for the advanced perennial gardener."
2,Rex to the Rescue needs help,"My third-grade son read this book and summed it up, ""The movie was better."" The book followed the story from the movie, but it was dull and unimaginative. I expected that it would be colorfully written, with some humor, but it was just plain boring. Also, it is way too easy for 9-12 year olds."
5,Great for prevention of Mastitus,I kept getting plugged ducts from nursing and my lactation consultant told me to order this. That was over a month ago and I havnt gotten an infection or a plugged duct since!
2,Melted together,I received the item and all of the pills had melted together. I know it was not due to heat as I had other bottles of pills that were delivered. I attempted to salvage what I could but ultimately I had to throw away over half the bottle because I couldn't get the pills out without them breaking.
3,"Used book, good alternative.","I was tracking the ecommerce course my son was taking ingrad school. Although a 2005 vs. 2011 copyright, it worked just fine."
4,Mr Clean Autodry Filter,I'v been using Mr Clean Autodry car wash for years. I love it. I'm very disappointed that it's being discontinued. I thought it was a great product.
3,Mr Clean Auto Dry Filter,"We loved the kit and used it on our 50 foot boat with rave reviews. When we ran out of auto dry we ordered this product. It looks a little different from the one that came in the kit and it doesn't sheet up as nicely. We were not so impressed and wondered if we had the wrong filter, but maybe we have to use it more. So we gave it a lower rating than expected. I still believe in the system and am sorry Target no longer carries it."
2,Filter need to be replaced after 2 car washes.,"Yes, the spot free works. BUT my new filter turned brown (which is the color that indicates the filter needs replacing) in just 2 car washes. The car is an Ford Expedition, meaning BIG, but two washes on one filter? In my view, too expensive for the benefit."
4,"Great system, but doesn't last as long as desired","Been using Mr Clean AutoDry system for a while now. As long as the filter refill is not used up (stops deionizing the water), you'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off, allowing it to dry spot-free. The thing you have to remember is that this isn't a pressure washer, or anything other than a system. You have to wet the vehicle, wash with the system's soap, and then rinse with normal water. When you're ready to dry, use the filtered water, and then let dry! Best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area, or the soap/rinse water will dry leaving spots.The only negative I have with it is that it doesn't last very long when you've got a full-size truck and a minivan that needs washing. After 2-3 washes of my vehicles (total, not each!) the filter doesn't deionize as well. But sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles! No more hand drying for me."
4,A great car washing aid.,"Mr Clean Autodry refill cartridges fit in a special car washing head for the hose, which also has a dispenser for a Mr Clean soap.Used properly, the Autodry system really does what is advertised. It provides rinse water free of minerals and junk, so that you don't need to dry your car after you wash it. It saves time, and I suspect a bit of wear on your paint, too.I'm impressed at how well the system works. As someone who has to take care of several cars, the time savings are most appreciated,"
1,TOO EXPENSIVE AND STILL LEAVES WATER SPOTS,"Not worth the cost; at a minimum of $1.00 per wash for ten washes that takes the cost of a wash for me to three dollars for everything..The thing that wasn't expected was I STILL HAVE WATER SPOTS..I did everything exactly as the directions stated; yet I still have water spots...After reading on the internet - ALLOT. I decided and made my own water deionizer. Use Both types of DI-Reson. One to soften the water and the second stage to Dionize the water.Know what? NO WATER SPOTS..It cost me $200.00 for all the parts; BUT I can reuse the reson by regenerating it..I also don't have to do this for around 1,000 gallons of water, so the cost is way lower."
2,Mr. Not-so Clean,"As the cleaning step in the Mr. Clean AutoDry System, this car soap was no more effective than plain water. Better to get regular car wash detergent, mix it in a bucket, and sponge the car down. No shortcuts with this product."
2,Did not reflect our experience at all!,"I read this book a month or so before our exchange student arrived and, although I didn't believe at the time that it had all the answers, I was not prepared for how utterly useless it was for our family. In contrast to the timeline given in the book, our student seemed to adjust quickly and well, then things got progressively worse as he became more and more comfortable in our home. He started out on his best behavior and ended up completely ignoring our house rules and the cultural norms of the school and community. I'm seriously considering writing my own book and calling it ""The Alternative Host Family Survival Guide""."
3,Take with a grain of salt,"I am a seasoned host mom as well as a new coordinator for an exchange organization. I read this book with the intention of giving it to new host families as a gift. I would agree with the reviewers who disliked this book. I am definately glad I never read this before hosting or I never would have tried it. While no host experience is perfect, they aren't nearly as negative or intimidating as this book leads you to believe, and yes we have had 2 horrible experiences. I also think they spend way too many pages on their time line....while every student adjusts differently I do not have students adjusting like they suggest 5-6 months after they arrive."
4,Wish I could have read it sooner,"Although some of the information is a little out of date, I found plenty of useful tips in this book. We had a foreign exchange daughter who ended up leaving because of ""culture shock"". My copy ended up underlined and highlighted in several places. I feel like we could have helped her more with some of the information I learned. Definately helpful for someone contemplating hosting."
5,Great Disc!,"Chris Walden has done an awesome job with his big band on all of the cuts of this album! Straight out of the box, Cherokee is a tour de force and every track afterwards is spot on!D.Saunders"
2,Bigband,"Not completly what you expect from a LA big band production. I was a bit dissapointed at first. Mr.Walden's arrangements are sometimes fresh, almost exciting but most of the time average or it could be it is not my Big band music tast. The playing is done by fine LA musicians, but it sounds not well together. Many subs for different tracks and I can hear this. Specially for the drums. It realy sounds like two bands at some points.Chris Waldens own playing sound like a imitation of europe's Finest flugelhorn players Ack van Rooyen, he does his best but doen't come close. But this not Chris his fault, but a great compliment to Ack van Rooyen.I think there is not enough energy between the fine musicians and the arrangements of Chris Walden.I am realy looking forworth to his next project, and realy would see the band live in action sometime.The Big band world needs young gifted people like Chris and I hope he goes on the way he does and I hope even better."
4,Decent Glass Coasters,"I was super-satisfied with the quick transaction. i love the coasters because it's fashionably adequate with my furniture. as for its purpose, it sometimes sticks to the bottom of a drink. other than that, it's great!"
2,Arrived broken and falling apart,"While the coasters that survived the trip to my house are pretty cool looking, every package of them arrived with some problem or another.These were going to be nice stocking stuffer gifts for friends and family and so I purchased 6 packs of coasters. On each individual pack had one of the problems:1) One or more coaster arrived chipped.2) The hard plastic packaging was torn, cracked, or broken.3) The metallic corner pieces to hold the coasters in place were detached from the glass bottom.Needless to say, I had to glue and tape a bunch of things back together before I could wrap them. I would have returned them, but I didn't have much time before driving down to my sister's place, so each had to come with an apology and explanation."
4,Love It,"The titles says it all. The only down side is if you use them for cold drinks you will eventually need to clean them, but that's not much of a downside to me."
1,A bad sequel to a bad game.,"If one of the worst games of all time gets a sequel that fails to offer any improvement and is actually LESS fun than the horrible original, why the hell would you want to buy it? That is exactly the case with this game. The original was quite bad, but no improvement at all is to be found here. While this is fun on the Playstation 2, it is absolute trash on the Game Boy Color."
4,Good,This a really good game. The really only problem is that you have to write down a code to if you want to return to your spot because you can't save your game.
3,Wrong One....,"I was looking for a different Wisecrack video, but this one was funny. Just not the one I intended on buying, and it was a present too! UGH! Shame on me for not noticing."
2,Disappointed,The price paid for this I expected much more. The main castle falls apart at the touch. We had to pick it up off the floor and it just fell apart. Put it back together and it fell apart again. The stairs are also not as pictured. They do not stay firmly in place at all. Feel it is not worth the value paid.
5,Ashley's Review,"J.K. Rowling has made a wonderful book series that all ages can enjoy. Now it is in Lego! It is so much fun to play with all of the people, rebuild, create and much, much more. You can do almost anything with these extrordinary peices that make up a castle. You don't have to follow the directions, go free! It is not a commanding toy like talking dolls who cry. You let your imagination do almost everything. Have fun!"
2,"Harry Potter, enough is enough",A 12 year old and a 9 year old put this set together. They had a great time getting it all set up. But as soon as it was all together they both looked at me and wondered why this set cost as much as it did. Both of them didn't think it was worth saving and saving for (neither did I). I felt they were selling the name not a good quality set that was worth the money. Think before you spend so much money on this set.
3,How long can it last?,"I loved Building this set, but it isn't very durable. any pressure on it at all is enough to make it fall apart. I was on the last step and my dog walked by and hit it with her tail, she knocked down and broke the main part. It's fun to build but be carful where you do it."
5,Mommy can't wait for christmas!,This is going to be a very hard item to find once the movie comes out. I bought it for my 7 year old Harry potter fan because so far this is the ONLY thing he is asking for for christmas! I must admit after looking at the box I can't wait to jump in and help him play with it! Good luck finding this toy in the stores!
1,Why pay this much when walmart sells it for $129?,Why would you pay this much? Walmart has the hogwarts castle for $129 and Toy's R Us has this for $149. Usually amazon has the cheapest stuff.... but NOT THIS TIME!
1,Cheap Made,Not enough time spent in creating this product. I'm in the retail business and I feel the price is to high to pass on to the consumer for a cheap looking product. What's happen to the Leggo fine craftsman work.
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. Very cool but disappointed. For the price paid, it was not worth it. The main castle falls apart easily. End up putting it together twice. I was also lacking a few pieces from the set. I was missing Harry's hair and a few little items but I got extra ""potion"" pieces. You can't play with this. You put it together and don't touch it or it will fall apart. IN addition, the stairs just wrap in circles to the touch. They don't stay firmly in place. Not worth what we paid for it."
5,"These are the original Chevy/GMC 13"" Rear Brakes.","If you need rear brake shoes for your big Chevy/GMC van or truck, these are the ones. This product is the original equipment by AC Delco. They are thicker and more sturdy than any replacement, including the other AC Delco parts that are interchangeable with it. Stopping is important, so just get the best brakes you can buy. These are the ones! Plus, this part needs to be replaced so infrenquenly that you may only buy them once during the entire life of your truck. So just get what works best. Also, if you're wondering, Amazon.com is the best for many auto parts, especailly if you know what you need. Super saver shipping, no tax, quick delivery. In many cases, their prices can't be beat. And the service is top notch. I have them delivered to my office and there's no waiting around at the parts store for what I need!"
1,Strings and things,"I don't know about the amount of strings, but the stories are definitely tall. Sorry but it is just more droll crud from the north. Gary, get out of the time warp."
1,Country music from Preston?,Gary has regressed musically since the heady days of Blue Siege. Where are they now? Come back Gary needs you.
5,Hilarious!,"Very few shows make me laugh aloud nowadays, but this one got belly laughs! Just when Howard fixes one mess he somehow gets himself into another."
5,I wish there were more shows like this!,"This show is, quite simply, very high quality in every respect. Brilliantly written and perfectly cast. The premise is fresh and is laugh out loud comedy at it's best. If there were more shows like this on TV, my DVD collection would be considerably smaller."
1,Awful Britcom,"I'm a huge fan of British comedies from Monty Python to The Royale Family. So, I had great expectations for TWWML. I was disappointed from the very first scene. It was an almost exact replica of a scene from Bridget Jones' Secret Diary. That's the main problem with this show. Like so many sitcoms before it, there's absolutely nothing new here. A prime example occurs when the main character lets a secretary try on his fiance's ring which has been in the family for years. Guess what happens? Hmmm. The same actress who plays Jane in the excellent series Waiting for God plays the secretary but, I'm afraid her talents, like everyone else's are wasted with this drivel."
3,"Not the origanal mixes, but good songs just the same.","The song Indian Reservation is the best. I would buy this just for this song. Kick's is good also, but these are not the origanal recordings. Can't beat the price though....."
2,The entire band is not here.,"This is more of a Mark Lindsay reprise of PR&R greatest hits - not the original recordings. He does a fair job, but the music lacks the style and punch of the original band - especially on tracks like Let Me and Him or Me."
1,Not Original Tracks!!! (Be Warned),"I am a ""Raiders Fan"" from way back but this is the ""weakest"" album of their music I own. These tracks are not as well done as the originals. The low price of this CD says something! Definitely look at the other CDs listed here for better representation of this terrific '60s band!"
2,"This recording, in no way compares to the originals!","I have been a Paul Revere fan since they gained fame in the mid sixties.It is only for this reason that I am so generous with my rating of two stars.Mark Lindsay's voice is not as powerful as it once was.He also seems unable to hit some of the high notes.Even though you can't beat the price, I would not recommend this album to anyone. Play it safe and stick with the originals."
4,"You look like a real prince, but you are a bum.","A friend got me this book as a birthday gift. It helped me remember that I am an independent woman who has her own life, her own ideas and her own solutions. More importantly, this simple little story emphasized that that life, those ideas and those solutions are valid: no matter what anyone else thinks. I have since suggested it to adult friends who, for whatever reason, also needed that reminder and my young (3 and 6 years old) cousins who I'm told enjoyed the story."
3,Book & Doll edition is not a great deal,"This is a great story, but I wouldn't have gotten the book & doll set if I'd realized that the enclosed book is the $1.00 version, which is only 3"" square. For the price, this set should include the full-sized paperback."
5,This book is a good counter-balance to Cinderella.,"I think this is an important book for any little girl to have, especially with the likes of Cinderella, Snow White, etc. A good lesson about being true to yourself. Not a bad lesson for young boys to learn either!"
2,pictues come out blurry,"The pictures comes out blurry and it take 4 AAA batteries. You have to constantly buy batteries. I will probably in a year spend more on batteries than i did for the camera itself. But my 4 year old daughter likes it and feels independent with it, so it serves its purpose."
1,This is horrible!!!!!,This is a horrible camera I can't even see half the pictures there just either pure white or dark and grainy. Do not buy from valley tech toys they have a 40% restocking fee if it's open. Well of course you have to open it to realize what a piece of crap this is.
5,"zrecs.com compared all and found this one was the best, and I agree","My 5 year old is wild about this and we are very pleased with the purchase. It's been easy for her, easy for us to download and unbelievably durable. We checked Zrecs.com which did a side-by-side comparison test-trials with all the kids digital cameras (pixie,world, and v-tech included)and they picked the fisher price one on all counts, including resolution. I do concede that the pic resolution is not at the level adult cameras are, but I imagine that has something to do with attempting to package that somewhat fragile technology in the sturdiest form possible. The pics are still good enough to put in a scrapbook, etc.Note: I would suggest spending the extra $ and buy the camera packaged with the extra memory card. It's hard to find it to buy separately and 60 pictures go quickly with trigger-happy kids. Hope this helps! Merry Christmas!"
4,Excellent for Preschoolers,"No doubt about it, this camera is a TOY! The picture quality is usually poor, but you can tell what the subject matter of the photo is. More importantly though, my now 3 y/o and 5 y/o absolutely love it! We've had the red (Target) version of the camera for over a year, it's been dropped, thrown and thoroughly abused, and it's still going strong. They've gone from taking pictures of the floor and of people's torsos (heads cut off) to actually composing a photo of a still life or of people's faces. They have never been disappointed by the picture quality, they're just happy to see the image on the view-screen. I first tried getting them an inexpensive ""real"" digital camera and it was much too difficult for them to use. If your kids can take care of a real camera, then skip this, but if you're looking for a fun toy, this fits the bill! I'd get another if I didn't want them to learn to share!"
4,Fun for a Four Year Old,"I recently got this camera for our daughter's 4th birthday. She has had a ball with it! She loves that it is a ""real"" camera & loves to see the images on it. I recommend it for little ones who want a real camera. For the older kids that want quality pictures however, this is not the one for them. It is nice & durable, but the quality of the photo is not good at all. My daughter gets a kick out of taking tons of wacky photos & best of all...we can erase them when she is done! It's fun."
4,great for first camera,"It's amazing how easy it is for my five y old daughter to use it. She found how to use it right, to delete pictures she didn't want any more very fast. The quality of pictures is very low, but that is not so important at her age."
3,Great for preschool age,"This is a great first camera for preschool age girls. My daughter loved taking pictures with this and found it very easy to use. There was some frustration over the quality of the photos, she found that she had to take pictures only in very good natural light to get a decent shot. She is seven now and ready for something more grown up looking that takes better quality photos, but I would recommend this as a fun toy for preschoolers, it is nice to know that if they drop it the thing won't break. I think it is too expensive though for what you get and would recommend looking for a second hand one."
4,Fun & Tough,My daughter got this last year for Christmas when she was 4. It is very easy for her to use. No it does not take gallery quality photos. They are somewhat better than the camera on my phone and they look much better once you download them then they do on the screen.One of the neighbor kids left the camera out in the middle of our backyard and we didn't notice for 2 weeks. We had a light freeze and about 6 inches of rain during that time. I put in new batteries and it worked just fine. It has been dropped down the stairs as well.She has a blast with it and it is incredibly durable.
2,HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY,I bought this camera for my daughter's 4th birthday. I liked the pink color and the looks of it on the picture. When I started to use it I noticed that the picture quality was horrible. I could not identify the person in the picture. After reading the instruccions I noticed there was a setting to make the picture quality better. SO I put it on that setting. IT DID NOT HELP... still the people in the photos were irrecognizable. Would not recomend it.
4,It's ok,"We got this camera for our 3 year old, because she loves to take pictures with our digital camera. However, the quality of the screen viewer is so bad that she doesn't really enjoy snapping a shot and looking at it the way she does with our camera (and that is what she loves). So, it doesn't quite do the trick. Also, when you look through the viewfinder what you see doesn't match with the photos the camera takes, which is also annoying and hard to remember as an adult, let alone a 3 year old.she does use it now and then, but not as much as I had hoped. We'll likely give her an adult camera soon - probably when we upgrade.I will say it is as tough as nails, though! And that's good!"
2,Crashed,Camera is constantly crashing when being used. we have to send ours back to the manufacturer in order to get it fixed and we only used it twiceMy daughter had alot of fun with it when it is functional. Although it doesn't have the games that was on the older version.
2,"This is a TOY, not a camera!","I was quite disappointed when testing the camera prior to giving it to my four-year old daughter. The picture quality is terrible. I don't think we will be keeping many of the 480x640 pixel, grainy images. However, my daughter absolutely loves the camera; it has become her favorite toy and she loves taking pictures of everything! She isn't a critic of the quality, so maybe I shouldn't be, either."
1,Dissappointed,"My 6yr. old daughter was so excited to get her first real camera. She was ecstatic when she began to use it. However, she was smart enough to realize that the picture quality totally stunk! Yes, she got to push the buttons on her own and take her own shots, but she also wanted them on the computer to look at. The pictures were horrible. This would be more suitable if she was three and didn't understand that the pictures go somewhere after the camera. It's a lot of money to pay for just another ""play"" camera. The camera has definitely held up well and still works, but it is definitely not close to a real camera."
1,JUNKY HUNK O PLASTIC!,"Do not waste your money. Sure, my daughter who is three was so excited to get her own cam and so was I until I looked at the pics. There is no reason why they at least cant be viewable. There is basically no point in even looking at the pics since you cant even make out any of them. Yes, the quality is that bad. This thing was not cheap and I just dont get it. She wanted to see her pics later and I showed them to her and her smile turned into a frown and she just kept asking to see her pics and I kept telling her over and over there they are!!!! She thought I had lost my mind. My cam phone takes pics 100 times better than this. Look if your kids are this age just give them one of your old digitals. My daughter has never dropped mine and if she does I dont really care since its my old cam. Otherwise go out and buy them a ton of those cheap disposables or a regualar digital one for half the price. Trust me on this one!"
4,A fun thing to have,"My kids love the Fisher Price camera. My daughter received it for her birthday, after asking for it forever, but my son loves it too. It doesn't take the best pictures in the world, but they still enjoy using it."
3,kids camera,I was dissapointed about the camera. Although it really captures is not handle and the display is very small. Besides the kid can't see the object in that display but in a very little window
4,The Complete Knife Throwing Guide,My grandson was very happy with the book along with several sets of throwing knives he received. Great holiday gift that will last throughout the year!
2,somewhat obvious,Not what i expected. The books basically boiled throwing knives down to what feels comfortable to you. Not worth the money.
2,Disappointing,The book is much more a pamphlet than a book -- flimsy andvery few pages. The pictures (black and white) are of poorQuality. I'm sorry that I bought this.
5,Nice and Helpful,The book was pretty helpful even if you just look at the pictures for the proper way to hold the knives. It does lack some information that would be very helpful but all in all it is a great deal for the price. I dont think you would be disappointed if you ordered it. It helped me out.
3,Ok,"This was a gift. It was delivered on time and in good shape. I was at first disappointed that it was so short, but after flipping through it, I think it will be okay for my sister (she's a beginner)."
4,Book for starters,Very in depth for beginners. Went over more topics and points then i had even thought of before trying this sport out.
3,Its okay,It was a gift for stepson along with a set of throwing knives. He is enjoying the book and trying how to throw the knives.
3,good read,is a good read and has many good instructions and directional drawing for visual learning. would recommend this to others
3,Very well written & illustrated instructional book,"this book is very helpful to say the least. gives you nice throwing techniques. i thought knives would come with it, but i bought some separately. in addition, you might want to have/buy some sort of throwing board though."
1,This is a great buy...if you find it for a buck and have a 50% off coupon...,"Read the description. 69 pages. For anyone who can't visualize sixty-nine small sheets of paper, it's about as thick as a quarter, little more than a pamphlet. It's got an overview on different knives, and basic instructions, with semi-helpful pictures, but not much else. The last few pages are dedicated to a minibiography on the author, and color photos of his knife collections. I found the most useful part of the book to be the 'section' dedicated to designing a target. As for throwing itself, I found more useful material on YouTube."
1,Wow... Almost a complete waste of time...,"This teeny 60-page pamphlet spends the first 30 pages telling you how great of a hobby knife-throwing is, and then provides instructions on how to build a large wooden target. Then it spends about 5 pages going over the same basic throwing concepts, then spends page after page espousing the virtues of EVERY KNIFE Hibben has every designed or licensed. Then they wrap it up with a flowery epilogue of just how great a guy he is. What an unconditional WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"
1,Waste of money,"This did not meet expectation. Nothing useful in the book that is worth the money. You can find these basic and I mean really basic stuff here, probably on line search somewhere. It is not even that big, 60 pages, each page of 6 X 3inches. Just saying, it is not worth 8 or 9 $, maybe 3$, unless you want to donate your money to the cause, whatever that is."
2,For Beginners Only,"Well, I got this book hoping to find some new tips and grips and so forth, but ended up only reading about things that I already knew. Kinda of a waste of time unless you're an extreme beginner, and haven't really ever held or thrown a knife. If this is the case, then go for it, the book shows what to look for after the knife sticks, but doesn't really give any solid advice other than to ""practice"". I didn't need to buy a book to know that..."
5,The world is about to become a very different place...,"Looking for a radical change in how you pursue relationships? Read what the ""love critics"" aren't telling you. Take a step into the spiritual, read the unbelievable, find a fantastic old reality about the finer points of life."
1,horrible condition,"The seller sold this book for over 60 dollars and it was in horrible condition. Its not even a hard copy, no color and had pencil and pen marks all over on most of the pages. But the content of the book isnt bad. I just feel that I paid TOO much for this."
3,disappoints,"I trust the Richard Wilbur Award books. Generally they are great books (for example, books from A.E. Stallings, Rhina P. Espaillat, and A.M. Juster). And I expected Carper's book to be another one of the great ones, after all, it is mostly sonnets, and I love sonnets. But I found that though they were technically well-written sonnets they didn't hold the magic that truly wonderful poetry contains. There were some good poems in the book, and I thought there were three great poems: ""Why Did The"" was hilarious; ""Flypaper""; and ""A Late Rembrandt Self-Portrait""--I could see it, you knew just exactly which one Carper was writing about. I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy this book, but I'm not going to recommend it either."
2,"Informative, but has a lot of errors","I've never seen a book that had so much incorrect information. When reviewing it in the class I needed the book in, the teacher and the class found at least one mistake per chapter on average. You would think after 9 editions, they would be able have caught most if not all the mistakes."
1,Horribly flawed,"As others have mentioned in the ""honest"" reviews, the text is filled with flawed information and inaccuracies. Anyone giving this a 5 clearly have not utilized the book in any fashion. For a topic that is to be very precise, the text's flaws make it laughable.If your class requires this book, I would in no way advise buying it new. Buy it as cheaply used as you can and avoid the ridiculous $90 cost for new. I'm pretty angry that a workbook of this expense cannot be returned for it's flaws, as by the time you realize how bad it is you've already filled in most of the answers.The 5-star reviews are doing a horrible disservice to potential buyers."
3,Definitely not garbage,"Milk is one of Garbage's smoothest most enchanting songs, and this CD has enough remixes of it to keep you on cloud nine (dreaming about Shirley). While it can get a bit repetitive if you listen to the same song over and over, in small doses this is a great disk to have in your collection. The remix of Stupid Girl at the end of the CD is okay, but defintely not as good as the original version. All in all, a good disk if you're a big Garbage fan."
3,Worth it for Siren mix,"This single is worth it just for the Siren mix, which is a beautiful mix of an acoustic guitar and Shirley's voice. Of course, the original album version is here too, which is good as well. I wasn't as much a fan of the Udder mix, which is pretty much a standard house beat type of song, and the Wicked or ""Tricky"" mix which is just the Siren mix with Tricky repeating the lyrics about a step behind Shirley."
3,"Fun, but don't bend over backward to get it","I have real Creature Feature memories of this one from when I was but a wee shaver, so seeing again was a treat. That being said, it is not a lost gem, rather it is very bad and dated but still watchable. This time around I was struck by how stupid the cops were. You have a string of murders and the police find Cameron Mitchell in a cape and eyepatch and with incredibly lifelike models of the deceased but don't make a suspect of him....Anyhow, that's the kind of movie it is.The violence is pretty tame by today's standards, and although there is no nudity, it does offer a totally bodacious go-go dance scene with interesting period costumes.The only other Amazon reviewer of this flick gave it five stars, which is completely unjustifiable, so I wanted to put my two cents in to set the record straight, particularly since it has become hard to find."
4,A good entry from the 60s,"Nightmare in Wax pulls together several themes that were popular in the 60s and 70s. There is the fascination with wax museums, and the sinister way in which they capture the appearance of real people, seen also in House of Wax, for example. There is also the preservation of life in body parts and, in particular, heads, such as in The Brain that Wouldn't Die. Add to that a comic twist of poking fun at actors and their own arrogance at their fame, such as in Theater of Blood. Nightmare in Wax brings all of these together, and it does surprisingly well for a movie that will remind you of so many others. Most notable are the scenes in the curator/scientists' lair which mix strange machinery, odd camera angles, and psychedelic color; the result is satisfyingly surreal."
1,Poor workmanship,"I purchased this product for the European adapter, I have not tried out any of the others. The workmanship on this product is definitely substandard. It would not hold the 110V plug because the width of the receptors was not correct. I had to take it apart and readjust them before the plug would hold. I hope it will work under load as I leave for Europe tomorrow."
3,Possible fire hazard,"Three of the four plugs fit tightly from what I could tell, but the one for Germany (two round holes) didn't hold the US plugs very well at all. When we tried plugging it into the socket, the loose connection made visible sparks. Even physically holding the pieces together did not create enough of a connection to charge any of the appliances."
3,Worked well in Cambodia and Vietnam,"Bought this for a trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and had no issues in any hotels.Recommend for the international traveler.Would be nice if there was a better way to store and carry the adapters. They are lose and don't join together in anyway, so be careful not lose them."
4,Adapter plugs/jacks,The plugs and jacks do indeed provide the means of converting from just about any pin configuration tojust about any pin configuration. They perform as advertised.
2,Fine for the price,"They work just fine (so far), however they are obviously of a cheaper quality than other brands I have. Also, the adapters aren't labeled so you have to keep the box/piece of paper to remember. Would be easier if they just labeled each one."
2,Works but really low quality.,"I bought this because I was going to China for a business trip - so I only really verified that the plugs work for China. As far as quality is concerned, all the plugs in this set are made of poor quality plastic. They feel cheap and easy to break. The contacts do not have a solid feel to them but they are also not too thin. I expect them to last if I am careful. These plugs won't take rough handling or frequent use."
5,Great to keep little hands busy.,"The book is a lot smaller than I expected - about the size of my hand. But, it works great for my toddler. He loves to pull the stickers off and on. The finish on the egg pages makes it easy to pull the stickers off and create a new design."
2,If you like being frustrated...,Buy this game. First thing the game is slow and you have to do every thing in exactly the right order or you can't move on. I spent two hours tring to find this one guy and when I do its someone I had already talked to. The only plus to this game is the fighting engine but theres not enough action in the game to use this as a selling point alone. My recommendation is to get another game.
5,Shenmue awesome game,This game was awesome. I loved how close it was to real life. shops opened and closed at different times. You had to be home to your Grandma at a certain time or she will make you come home earlier. You get allowance every morning and later in the game you even get a job. The only disappointing thing was how short the game was. But overall with its sweet 3-D graphics its one of my favorite games.
3,Watch the movie,"Half of the time you run around trying to find the next clue. The rest of the time you spend watching people talk. You drive a forklift for most of the game just to fight once. Fighting rarely happens. Don't get me wrong graphics are great and the story is good, .... Not my type of game. Too realistic for a video game. Fun gets thrown out for realism."
2,Is this it?,"With all of the hype surrounding this game, I thought it would be a whole lot better than this. Of course by now you've heard about the great graphics. Okay, I'll give you that, but I want a game not a movie, so I care about how it plays and that's where 'Shenmue' falters. The gameplay consists of punch-punch-kick style action and at times it's restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene. 'Yawn'. I actually dropped off a little during part of it; no joke. While it is certainly a technical achievement, it's more movie than game."
2,Don't Swallow The Hype,"Well I have to tell you that I couldn't wait to get my hands on Shenmue. Then I did get my hands on it and I was quite disappointed. How long can you walk around and have the same people tell you that they will talk to you tomorrow? Don't get me wrong, the graphics are incredible on this game. Better than any of the current PS2 games that are out there, but it just didn't live up to all the hype given to it. Some people love it. Some people hate it. I found that it is a beautiful game and a kool concept, just not for everybody. And mine and my friends both started freezing up at load points. So, on a final note, I think that shenmue is a testimonial that game companies should stop worrying about how kool the games look, and focus on just giving us good games with good plots. Like how about some more F.F. games. PLEEEEEEASE!!!"
3,game isn't done,"This game is a great way to explore life. You play a high school student who is looking for his father's killer while needing to get a job. You can play videogames in the local arcade, buy toys, buy a saturn similar system and play games on it, make phone calls, and do anything you would want to do as of real life. Aside from the real story you can do all these things and more. You can do almost anything you can do in real life. But all this comes with a price. The game isn't finished. You only get a small portion of the story. You don't even get to meet the only other main character. And she's in almost all the Shenmue pictures! Expect to spend hundreds to actually buy the entire game. Cus' I heard from a guy that there's gonna be 8 chapters for shenmue(Not confirmed). And this is only Chapter 1!"
5,gotta have it,if u dont have this game then your missin out!!! this is the biggest and best game that has ever come out of sega i've been there sence sega genesis and let me tell you they come a long way. but enough about that shenmue is an RPG/freestyle type game where you take over the life of ryo hazuki after his father is murdered you vow to find and kill the murderer. you roam around town asking questions and investigating around. i think that this game is a must have and other than load time theres nothing wrong with it what-so-ever!
5,As Good as it Gets,This game is so realalistic that once you turn it off you think your still playing. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is awesome. The QTE is unique and the free battle is cool. The only complaint is that it is too short. It only took me 4 days to beet it with no guide. But other than that the game is prefect in every aspect.
5,Best Game Ever?,This game is so awsome I don't know where to begin. First of all you can do anything you want to like buy a coke or play Hang On at the video arcade. The graphics are the best of any game I've played. The best part is that you can get a job where you operate a forklift to lift crates for some cash. If you have a Dreamcast this is a must buy! If you don't have a Dreamcast buy one just for this game.
5,Robert Lemons Jr,"It was all good until the game endend. The ending is a real letdown, he learns one more move and sails off into the sunset. And now you have buy Shenmue 2 to see what happens next. Which is fine by me, all except Microsoft bought rights to it, so now you cant play it on you Dreamcast. Ah well, this is a good game, good graphics, graet gameplay and storyline, go buy it."
5,fun and thats all,no review is worthy of such a awesome gameGRAPHICS 5/5SOUND 4/5GAMEPLAY 5/5FUN 999999999999/5
3,not the best,"I bought a dreamcast just for this game and after 2 hours of play I took the system and the game back for a refund. Graphically this game is amazing, and the sound is also great... but after 2 hours of playing I find it the game is slow and gets boring very quick. Living in a virtual world is frustrating and slow most times. This game is for people who have tons of time, (not for me) I like games that I can jump in, have a blast, and get out. This game does not let me do that.. it's so slow that it makes final fantasy feels fast paced. For realz, I feel the only reason to play this game is to check out the amazing graphics and the 3D environments. But living in a virtual world is just sad imo. you gotta be a person with no life to do that..."
1,Forklifting is My Top Priority,"I am a black man who stars in this game. I am sensitive and I speak fluent Japanese. I manage the forklift operation day to day on Disc 3 (only). At a certain point, Ryo (of Shenmue) shows up for a job at my plant. He is a good driver of forklifts, but his skills do not surpass enough to qualify for number one forklifter. I have a hunch he will help me with my own brother's disappearance and the Long Jah (aka the secret trade of Mad Angels back by Pier 17). I am going to fire him this week."
1,Stay away from this abysmal game.,"Shenmue is like an RPG with no battle system. I do not know what Yu Suzuki is thinking when producing this game because it's so darn boring. Sega's multimillion dollar disaster leaves the player sleeping through hours of asking people for clues about who killed the main character's father. To add some action to the game, Sega added a pathetic Budo fighting system that is similar to Virtua Fighter 3 but with an even worse animation. Please stay away from Shenmue, this game is the Weakest Link of RPGs."
2,There really is not to much to Shenmue but a pretty face.,"Shenmue has some amazing graphics and the sound is great to go along with that, but the gameplay is terrible. How much fun can walking around asking tons of people questions and getting the same answer be??? Ok the free battles are pretty fun, but then there is not really much to keep you coming back for more. You should rent this game before you even get the idea of even buying it, but this could be the game of your dreams, so give it a rental. ( besides a rental is all it takes to beat the game.)"
3,Get Gandia 2 and Arcadia. This is a waste of time.,"I got this a week ago and im amazed at how they put a good idea to waste. It had a decent storyline (it wasn't a FF7 ...) the graphics were amazing and the fighting system was good. They did however ruin it. First there are few to many fights and the game goes incredibly slow. Next the analog stick is used for camera, u have to use the d pad. Finally frequently throughout the game u have to wait for 4 or 5 game hours (30 minuets real life) just siting there waiting for either the night clubs to open or if u have an appointment with somebody. It's games like this that make believe square is the only company which can make good rpg's.."
5,Best Game Ever!!!! Must Buy Game!,This is the greatest game ever. It is a lot of fun to play and it has a good story. My favorite parts of the game are the free battles and the games you can play in the arcade. It is not the funnest game to watch but when you play it the game is a 100 times better. The great thing is they're coming out with sequels which will be 3 times better. If you haven't played this game you don't know what fun you're missing.
3,"Great game, but...","Well, well...What can I say about Shenmue? I subscribed to the Official Dreamcast Magazine a long time ago, and when I saw this game in a preview, and then in a whole six page review, I knew I had to get it.I think that my hopes may have been a little too high...The game is great, but I was expecting a little more input than movielike storyline output.The fighting is great...when it happens. The graphics are stupendous...period. The thing that bothers me is that you're constantly on a wild goose chase trying to find someone. It gets rather tedious, especially with the time ticking by...sometimes you need more time than you have, sometimes you need less.But I do like the game a lot. I'm glad that I finally got to play it, and I wasn't completely let down...It's a wonderfull experience, and I think everyone should try it. If you like it, cool; if not, then ok."
3,"So, where was the game?","Honestly, I couldn't play this game after about 5 days. There was just too much running around, waiting, running around some more, waiting, then finally getting to talk to someone. I do that in real life and it's much more fun. Now, the graphics were outstanding and the voice acting was very good...but I wish they would have spent more time on the game itself. It just didn't have that something special that most other rpg's have."
3,"Shenmue, the game of questions","I recieved this game for Christmas. I thought it would be awesome. The whole game you walk around, do something, and then have to repeat the process by walking around the city and asking people questions. The mini games are pretty fun but the game isn't so great."
4,This might be as good as it got for the dreamcast,"You play as Ryo Hazuki, a kind of shady young Japanese man in 1986 Yokozuka Japan. You must spent 12 to 15 hours a day ""in game time"" searching for clues to find his father's killer.I'll make a quick pro & con type of review:Pros: 1.You can play old arcade games ranging from ""hang-on"", darts, Punch-out 1 & 2. 2. Sparring with the guy in Ryo's dojo.3. A daily five dollar allowance.4.The forklift job is easy and fun.5. The 70 man battle minigame is playable upon finishing the game. Cons: 1. You don't acually meet Ling Sha Hua, the girl who is in the opening sequence, who is in China. 2. Ryo is a more offensive fighter than defensive fighter.3. The snow doesn't stick to the ground.4. The in-game timer moves at almost an hour per minute.5. The replay value is low unless you care for the actual weather.Buy the stategy guide for this game if you don't want to miss out on anything!"
5,Shenmue!,"Shenmue takes place in Japan circa 1986. Lan Di, a warrior comes to Ryo's father's dojo in search of a mirror. Ryo's father refuses to give Lan Di the mirror, while Ryo finds out his father killed someone in battle a long time ago. Since he didn't give Lan Di the mirror he killed his father. Ryo sets off in an adventure to avenge revenge on Lan Di. Awesome game! Superb graphics, high detail. My only con about Shenmue is you have to walk around too much. A great mix of fighting, adventure, and RPG. Great job Sega! Lets hope Shenmue 2 is just as good!~"
5,Best Game I Played On Sega Dreamcast ! !,"(...)If you don't have that game get it. I'll guarantee it you will love it.When i bought it, the first day i played it like 6-7 hours,couldn't belive how much fun it is.You can play old sega games like.. Space Harrier, play dartsand a lot more.I LOVE THE GRAPHICS !! Unbelivabe.I would like to say a lot of more about this game but it would be too long... sorry(GET THE GAME)"
5,The best Sega game ever!,This Game has it all. Great game play great graphics. Even great mini games. I heard of this game online. So I decided to try it out. Good thing I did or else I would have missed the best Sega game made. Everybody in this game talks. You walk on the streets and talk to people everyone has a different voice and says different things. Tons of action and fighting. This game will last you along time. There are four cd's included. Three are for regulear playing and one is called the passport it tells you how to play and stuff like that. To play you should use the stradgity guide or else it will be very difficult to play have fun!
4,"The graphics are so cool, but I hardly have gotten to fight!","I've only started playing, but there isn't much fighting yet. The graphics are awesome though."
3,Not so good anymore,"When I first got a glimpse of Shenmue, I thought it was a cool game. The previews were awesome(however you spell that)and it looked great. I began playing and got so addicted that I hated going to school for the entire dayand couldn't play it. But after I found out that there was no magic-oriented or powers, it got old quite quickly. Finally, after I got to the motorcycle sceen, I was bored to heck. Needless to say, the first half of the game was top notch, but the second half [stunk]. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't end, it goes on to sequel games. So, if you like Fighting/RPG games in one, you'll love Shenmue. For me, 1st person RPGs will never make big. The only thing I can do with Shenmue now is trade it to my friends for a little time for their games."
3,It's great to look at,"Spend 30-million on a game and this is what you get. Ranked by many as ""the best game ever made"", I would have to say it may be the largest signifigant leap into an alternate reality since N64 Mario World, however it's reign will be short-lived.""Metal Gear Solid 2"" for PS2 has already been demoed and from a technology stand-point it will blow Shenmue away.Aside from that tid-bit, I gave this game 3 stars because of it's cultural differences. As an American I didn't pick up on all the humor and it's cultural elements are kind of annoying, had the game been placed in the US it may have been more enjoyable for me and I would have given it an extra star.It is an amazing game, however it requires time, effort and probling solving skills like any adventure game. I'd rather play Sonics Adventure."
4,The Most Innovative 128-bit Game Ever,"Certainly Sega's Dreamcast should have lasted longer than it did. With titles like Soul Calibur, Sonic Adventure 2 and Crazy Taxi among others, the system should have been more than a cult hit. Enter Shenmue, while certainly flawed, is definitely the most unique, playable experience you can get on the system. I'm sure you already have read tons of opinions on the game ranging from revolutionary to horrendous. It certainly is a revolutionary game, but being revolutionary doesn't make it perfect. For as infinite and limitless as the game's environment feels, the quest is actually pretty linear. You'll have to perform tasks in specific order, and some of the tasks (such as working and moving crates) becomes extremely monotonous. Otherwise, with the Dreamcast's best graphics and music and the best story line in video game history, Shenmue is a must have for Sega enthusiasts and those looking for a unique adventure on their television set."
2,Does Mr. Yakamoto Live Here?,"This game is one of the most time-consuming and frivolous games out there for the Dreamcast. The missions are dull with hardly any decent action. The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto. You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him. It always happens that his house is the last you look at. Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them. There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open.This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it, borrow it from a friend. If you don't have any friends, then only dish out the $6 to rent only if you think you might like it."
3,"Really slow, somewhat boring","Well I think my title says it. I was very excited to play this game at first, then I was confused. Why am I not fighting anyone? That was the question I asked myself after a few hours playing the game. This game can be very dumb, like asking the same question over and over again. It's new to the people your asking in the game, but not for you. Then, of course, there is the constant wandering around, trying to find people. Then when you find them, they don't tell you anything. They just tell to go find some other shop and waste some more time. Dissapointed"
2,A very Pointless Game,Please don't buy this game for your own good. Even though the graphics were great that wasn't enough to make this game great. All you mostly do is talk and once in a awhile you fight. The plot of the game was good but was really made me rate this game so bad is that they don't even let you finish it. I don't know about all the other gamers out there but I for one am a person who buys a game and expects to finish it and not have to wait for the stupid sequel. The games cliffhanger really did it for me but if you like waiting for a sequel or like cliffhangers in a game then this game might be for you. But if you want to finish a game without having to wait for a sequel then I suggest you just rent it and don't buy it.
3,Boring......,"This game was sooooo cool when I first got it. I played it for days, but then I got stuck and didn't want to cheat and I kept falling asleep and forgot where I was every time I played.So, I just let my friends borrow it, cause I don't want to start over."
3,Innovative but boring!,"I have to add my $.02 here. I rented Shenmue and played through the first disc and into the second before I had to return it. I can say that I will not buy this game. The main reasons being 0 replayability and absurdly easy game play. I found no challenge to the game so it got boring. Yes, the graphics are good and the game play is new and different, yadda yadda, but it's boring. Simple as that."
2,"Good selections, lousy sound quality.","While the songs were good, the sound quality of the CD wasn't. I found that turning up the bass helped a in offsetting the incessant blair of the trumpets, but it didn't help much. A couple songs that did sound pretty good, however, were 'Perfidia' and 'American Patrol.' I would recommend this CD to diehard Glenn Miller fans who don't mind imperfect recordings."
1,Watch out!,"True, the chain is lovely. But notice the clasp was a little cheap. The first day I wore the chain, it feel off."
3,:),I got my iteam by the time it was said to arive and in great condtion. I amhappy with this product.
4,from someone who has read alot for many years!,This is an awesome book of short stories....I highly recommend...just bought it and am on my second trip thru!
2,Poor Storytelling and Inaccurate Paintings,"Not only do the tales of this compilation do nothing to titilate the reader's mind, they drive home incorrect and outdated notions about Witchcraft. The authors should have bothered to contact real, in-the-flesh Witches (the religion of Witchcraft is very real) before writing their bastardazations of the Craft."
2,crap,"I had heard this was pretty good, but I expect more out of Johhny Wang. Mang Fei is obviously trying to copy Jackie, and doesn't do a bad job, but who can't act better than Jackie? This movie actually loses momentum during the fight scenes. I need to start a pole to see who is a better screen fighter, Cliff Lok, or Mang Fei. That would be one hell fo a long fight, but I think Mang Fei would pull it out by a hair."
5,fantastic,I have seen previous copies of this movie ... the star of this movie is Meng Fei good story excelent coreogragh of fighting scenes...the master drunk tells the name of the steps to beat an opponent... good closse up
4,Calming and Soothing,"I had never listened to or ever really liked this type of music until it was played in our childbirth class to keep a relaxed and calm atmosphere. During that class, Cloud Dancers was played. I purchased RainDance because I enjoyed Cloud Dancers so much and I still prefer Cloud Dancers to this one. I'm not exactly sure as to why there's a preference since you can't say the lyrics are inappropriate or anything like that. I think it's just more calming to me. We used Cloud Dancers during labor and delivery of our daughter and have continued to use it as background noise when she sleeps and to help prepare her for naps and bedtime. It works great and helps me to relax as well."
5,peace,"I first heard this CD in my birthing class. I am getting it for my babies nursery, it was very peaceful and I think it will help sooth him at bedtime."
1,"Not quite ""universal""","The service was excellent. Item arrived in advance of anticipated date. Well packed. Unfortunately, this ""universal"" charger does NOT fit Kodak cameras. It was returned. The return process was quick, easy and effective. No hassels."
2,"One of the few AC adapters left w/ 5V option, but it lasted 2 months","I am only giving this product 2 stars instead of 1 because while it lasted, I appreciated using it with my Creative Nomad Zen Xtra (the AC adapter that came with it was damaged), which required 5V DC in. For some reason, very few retailers have a universal AC adapter that gives the 5V choice anymore (most that I have seen do 3V, 4.5V, 6V, 7.5V. 9V, etc.). It is possible that some 5V devices would not be damaged by 4.5V in, but I don't think it is worth the risk for a $200 MP3 player.Anyway, the product lasted 2 months and then died. It was cheap, so I probably shouldn't have expected much."
4,Know the exact voltage settings,"If you are looking for an adapter for a digital camera, the most important purchasing decision for this items is exactly what the voltage settings are.From reading directly on the voltage switch, this adapter is compatible with 3, 3.3, 5, 6, 6.5, 7 voltages. I am using it with the HP 935 Digital camera and works fine using the 3.3 volts. It folds so you can travel with it easier too.NOTE: I could not find a 3.3 V compatible from Radio Shack plus they are much more expensive."
3,In praise of the seller.,"I received the product sooner than their estimated delivery date, which is always a nice bonus.While the Universal Multi Voltage had a slight problem, which a family member was able to correct, the service I received from the seller at 'Accessory Genie' was outstanding.I can't praise the people at 'Accessory Genie' enough. They went above and beyond the norm."
5,Loved it for 10 years.,"I have loved this Christmas CD for at least 10 years. The music is timeless, and great for listening while reading or in front of a fire. You can almost see the snowflakes falling on ""Coventry Carol."" Enjoy for years to come."
5,Na Leo Pilimehana Freinds CD,"THis is a wonderful CD that will take you to Hawaii and the song The North Shore Serenade will take your breath away with visions of the North Shore Beauty. Oahu is the setting for the Hawaiian CD and these women are have beautiful voices. You will find yourself playing it over and over. i heard it in Hawaii and just had to have the CD which I found on Amazon.com. I hope you like it as much as I do. Of course, not every song on any CD is a winner, but most of these songs are really good. My favorite song is the North Shore. ENJOY!"
3,A disappointment,"The first Lifeguards mini-series was good, and so was the first book of this mini-series. But this was just full of crazy and unbelievable things just to make the plot more intresting, though it in fact makes it boring. All the characters were nothing like themselves, except for Elizabeth, Jessica and Ryan who together make the only good plot in this book. This book and the next one feel as if the other sub-plots are just there to make the book longer, especially the plot with Stu and Nina, which is just too weird. The only realistic plot is the one with Ryan, Jessica and Elizabeth. If you liked the first book in this trilogy, prepare to be disappointed with this one."
5,"This book was featured on ""The L Word"" on Feb. 4th!","There's a reason why Cybil Shepard's character, newly out as a lesbian, is so excited about this book. It's comprehensive, clearly written, and literally contains everything you need or want to know, but may not even have known enough to ask about lesbian sex. Wish this had been available when I came out years ago. Disclaimer: The author, Felice Newman, is known to me -- as a somatic coach and sex educator, who saved our 20 plus yr relationship from LBD (lesbian bed death). As her clients and her readers, we can't say enough about how much she's done for lesbians everywhere and the two of us in particular."
5,"A note from Felice Newman, author of The Whole Lesbian Sex Book","I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that The Whole Lesbian Sex Book is available from Audible. I worked with the narrator for much of the summer of 2012, listening and refining to make sure the finished audio book would truly reflect the ""voice"" of the print and ebook editions. There's something to be said about getting your sex advice via audio. I found myself wrapped up in the content, experiencing much of the same emotions I did in writing it. I suspect you will find the audio even more inspiring than the print version! Best wishes to you, dear reader. Here's to a life of abundant pleasure!Felice Newman, author"
4,You need to know this stuff,"I bought the book The Whole Lesbian Sex book: A passionate guide for all of us, it had a lot of information in it that I didn't know. I bought this book to find out what to do in bed with a lady. The type of things you want to know about are in the book pertaining to sex. I bought another book at the same time.Lesbian Dating: Officially , Maybe, I ThinkTo explain what to do in the actual relationship with the lady. Both books were wonderfully helpful. You need both books because The whole Lesbian Sex book really will help you when it comes to maneuvering the sex aspect of your relationship it's about 10 percent of the relationship but it's a very very important 10 percent. So you want to get it right. However no relationship is just sex so you need to getLesbian Dating: Officially , Maybe, I Thinkfor the other 90 percent of the relationship. Get both."
3,Clear overview of basic information; good starter book,"Very basic--that's possibly not a bad thing! I think this is a clear, quick-read guide for someone who's just starting to think about having sex with another woman. A lot of the information becomes old-hat and fairly obvious once you have any experience, but it works well as a first step into helping understand and articulate what's possible in bed (or elsewhere) and what you might want (or not want)."
4,Answers,This book is wonderful and informative. Especially if you haven't had much experience and are young. It answers questions that either women are too bashful to ask or have never thought about. Felice Newman breaks sex up into several catagories making you go absolutly wow and I hadn't thought of doing that before. She also answers a lot of questions that young lesbians need to know. Even if you are dating or even in a long term relationship you need to give this book a peek. It has some great insight.
4,Was expecting to more,"Wanting to be the best """"Lover"""" I can be, I was expecting to read something that I did not know. Anything new happenning Ladies?? Anyway, I was slightly dissapointed but still a good read with good instructions and has vlaue."
4,Good Replacement,Not made quite as well as the Honda product but it works well. I've used this filter on several occasions and they do the job. Nice price too.
3,Surprislingly Boring but a Good Workout Nonetheless,"somewhere, sometime, i misplaced my tae bo advanced dvds which are now WAY too expensive for me (but if you can afford them they're awesome). so i tried this. and honestly, i was underwhelmed. it's a great workout, just not that fun. the energy seems to just not be there as it was in earlier videos. it'll still get you looking good though :)"
1,Very disappointed overall,"I had high expectations for this salad spinner, but it fails in 3 areas. First, it is nearly impossible to get the spinner to go fast enough to get the water off of the lettuce! That defeats the original purpose of this device. Second, it's rather small - you must wash and spin the ""average"" head of lettuce in halves. Third, although the outer shell is all stainless steel, the handle and the internal basket are just inexpensive plastic, just like any other spinner. The handle in my new unit has popped off a few times. I don't expect this spinner to last more than a year or two. I would avoid this item."
5,MIU France Stainless Steel Salad Spinner,It was only about $14 more than the model under it but was eligble for super saver shipping so in reality was maybe $8 over the price of the lower model - well worth the cost difference. My wife is a vegetarian and was thrilled to get such a well designed salad spinner. I would highly recommend this purchase you'll never need to buy another one.
1,Broke in less than one yr,"Initially only problem was the handle occassionally popping off; otherwise worked great. Then after 10 mos, a plastic part on the top that is integral to the spinning action broke off and now it is totally worthless. Way too much money for only 10 mos of use!"
3,Returned it.,The spinner mechanism of this product didn't seem much sturdier than those of plastic spinners and I prefer to work with plastic salad spinners so I returned it.
1,Book should be in pulp fiction section,"I bought the book because I was familiar with some of the people involved in the story. I also threw it away without finishing the book. It was poorly written, the story rambled, the author took many liberties in filling in his own version of details of people and events, and it seems like much of the facts were taken from court documents instead of interviewing the people involved.In short, don't waste your time."
3,sterling bead necklace,"I ordered this sterling bead necklace for a pendant. It was right length,and I like it. I own many sterling silver pieces of jewelry. Most of themI know their quality by whether they tarnish or not when I wear them. Thisnecklace tarnished a little after wearing it for a few days. Still likenecklace and I know how to get rid of tarnish. But must admit I was a little disappointed that necklace tarnished."
3,"Not impressed, but not disappointed.","I can work w/this. Iv order several chains from Amazon last year, only to be disappointed almost everytime. At lease I can work w/ this."
3,prada?,I am very happy with this bag however I'm not sure if it's real. The bag is really cute.Good everyday bag nce size.
1,Good and Moral book subtley made dark...,"If you like the book Anne of Greene Gables and were looking for something good for your children to watch. Beware!! This may not be it. In the book Marilla teaches Anne about God and Anne goes to church. When she seeks advice she goes to Marilla. Marilla tells her the christian thing to do. In this series Anne has an imaginary friend who is a druid. Anne gets advice from the druid. So instead of going to Marilla or God, now a twelve year old girl is asking an imaginary friend (a sorcerer, magical creature) for help. I don't know any twelve year old's that have imaginary friends. What's wrong with telling the story the way it is. Leave the book alone. People who like Anne like God too. Come on!"
4,Enlightened reading for young and old alike!,"My 14 year-old son breezed through all 12 in just a couple of weeks. He thoroughly enjoyed following the Earthens, Rainbows and Supernaturals throughout all of their adventures. Not since Harry Potter has a series kept him so enthralled. As both a mother and a child psychiatrist, I appreciate the Rainbow Chronicles' wholesome quality and theme of peace."
4,Working as expected,Bought 4. Working fine in my small data center. Did have trouble with one unit having a bent chasis. Just before sending it back we were able to squeeze the battery into the compartment - elbow grease and some help from gravity (very heavy!). I suggesting buying Amazon Prime to get free two day delivery; it more than paid for itself with shipping just one of this heavy units.
2,A Real Winner!,Great writing combines with a well-paced build up of important clues to the rest of the storyline. Ariel is an engaging character from the get-go. Bravo on this one!
5,Great book from the master.,This is a book of problem solving on a quantum scale from the great master himself. I don't recommend this to anyone not solidly grounded in Quantum theory though.
3,This is a great first step ...,"July 12, 1999First and foremost thank you for producing this initial release of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures.I am a total fan of Richard Feynman's series of Physics lectures and enjoy them both for their knowledge and historic value but ...I would really like to see a transcript made of this audio lecture and have it reproduced by a professional narrator like Jeff Riggenbach who has done work for audio scholar. Jeff Riggenbach's work is excellant! Listen to T-Rex and The Crater of Doom as one example.I would repurchase all of the Richard Feynman Physics lectures done to date if this could please be done. The current tapes are OK but the sound quality and announciation could be so much better. Arnold Veness"
2,Read Brian Greene instead.,"I wouldn't advise anybody to read this book. I'm positive Feynman is brilliant, but I think there are very few truly bright people who can write a suposedly simple book on physics. I'd read Brian Green, Krause, or maybe even Richard Dawkins (he writes on biology, however. Not physics). I've read all of Greene's books. They are wonderful."
3,Easy physics as it was in mid 20th century,What may have been interesting and informative in the 60s is not so today (end 2012).This book is no more than nice (nostalgic?) for people with some background in physics but may suit those with no background whatsoever.
1,Why Does John Carradine Make These movies?,"Once again John Carradine, a fine actor, appears in a horrible movie. Also along for the ride is Paula Raymond, who starred in the Ray Harryhausen classic ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms."" There she helped track a dinosaur. Here she gets chained to a wall, and menaced by a bozo. You have vampires who never seem to drink blood, a werewolf who doesn't bite anyone, and the usual crew of idiots who don't have enough sense to run when the not-so-scary music starts. This woofer barks at the moon and has ruined every carpet in my house. Give it a pass. Better still, give it a decent burial, preferably with a stake through its heart. So why did Carradine make these movies? Duh! FOR THE MONEY! And he laughed all the way to the graveyard..."
3,split fin not for me...,I do a lot of snorkeling... I gave these fins a good try but just couldn't get the thrust I get from my old stiff U.S. Diver fins.
2,Flimsy feel - a light weight fin,"I've been scuba diving and snorkeling for 30 years. I had tried a Scubapro split fin and loved them and came across these online and thought well this looks good.Well I was disappointed as I did not get much thrusting power from this fin. In fact it just felt flimsy and was a lightweight in the fin department. If I had been able to eyeball this in a store first, I would not have bought it.It may be great for a teenager or smaller person, but not foe a serious swimmer."
1,SUCKS,"Unless you were size 9 or less do not order these. I were 11 and they barely fit without boots, if i put on the boots i can't feet even my fingers in them"
3,Good value PC,I've had this pc for a week and have not had any problems. Made 15 DVD copies of a digital tape without difficulty.
4,"Great thermometer, but...","I bought this thermometer to use for recording basal body temperature. From what I could tell, it is identical to more expensive version marketed for this purpose. I am really impressed with the design and ease of use. The beeping that some complain about is not particularly loud and actually helpful (at 6am, it's nice to know it's placed correctly and working). I would give the thermometer 5 stars except it needs a battery after using it less than 2 weeks. I'm not sure if it was sitting on the shelf for a few years (causing the battery to drain) or if the back light and beeping eat the battery that fast. When I have to replace this one, I'm thinking of a glass thermometer (no beeping to keep me awake but also no battery to worry about)."
1,awful product I have ever had,"I used this BD Digital thermometer over a month. It is awful product I have never purchased. The results were not correct. The results were never within basal BBT chart. The temperature should be between 97 to 99 Fahrenheit. It turned out every time was out of range. I used other brand of the thermometer,Vicks. That was totally fine. I am going to put this BD Digital thermometer in the trash. DON'T BUY THIS. By the way, if I could give this product zero star and I would."
1,Never worked,"I have purchased 2 of these, the second was purchased after I thought the first was just a bad apple in a bunch. Neither one has ever given me an accurate read, or a consistent read. Some reviews point to a consumers report, but I have never had one that worked. Because of this I have never purchased a BD product again."
1,Totally useless,"The battery in my old digital thermometer went dead after three years. Not unexpected. I bought a new battery but couldn't get the new battery placed inside the case correctly. So I decided to buy a new thermometer because I was happy with my old one from Walgreens. The BD was inexpensive. Big mistake. The day I received the BD, I was feeling well, and decided to give the thermometer a test run prior to needing it in the future. The BD never worked correctly. I could leave it under my tongue for almost 5 minutes, and the thing would not beep to show that the temperature was complete. The temperature readings varied from 95.3 degrees to 98.8, all within a half hour.Not worth the hassle and expense of sending back. Unfortunately, it is destined for a landfill much ahead of its time."
1,Waste of money,I tried this thermometer multiple times and couldn't get correct reading nor accurate ones. I find very useless since it cant be trusted and you're back to square one.
3,digital thermometers just don't seem as accurate,"If I take my temperature with this digital thermometer numerous times in a row, I get different results within about 1 degree of each other. Sure, I get the results quickly, but I'd rather take a few more minutes and get a rock solid reading using the old mercury thermometers."
1,Defective thermometer,"Defective thermometer. Unreturnable once opened.How does one know something is defective unless one opens it?American Wholesaler has reasonably good ratings, but we give it zero stars."
4,Works for me,"Like:I like that it records the temperature, so if I just want to go back to sleep I can retrieve it later to record it.It beeps to let you know it's measuring successfully, and you can hold your thumb over the tiny hole to make it quieter.Dislike:It doesn't stay lit but if you push the button again to light, it might re-start. So the back-light isn't exactly helpful.Sometimes I can't seem to find the right spot in my mouth to take the temp - the beep lets you know when you have it right so at least if I don't hear the beep I can adjust, but it seems a little picky.It's not very comfortable to hold under my tongue. I think I will buy a different thermometer if I ever need to take a kid's temperature because one I had before had a flexible tip that was more comfortable."
4,good,this game is lots of fun i mean whats better than going around town spray painting walls and cars and getting the cops and other people upset with you.One thing i found that i was very impressed with was the animation is beutifal to look at.One other thing i was afraid there was not gonna be enough characters but alas i was wrong there are plenty of characters you can use to help spraypaint town.
5,JET GRIND RADIOOOOOO,This game is the best. It's like tony hawk with graffitti. you do tricks and grind up and down rails. you have to collect cans to do all the graffitti in the levels. there are 3 different cities and 4 differnt gangs going against you. plus a bunch of differnt characters
5,Great game - and a must have at $9.99!,"Wow, this is a great game at any price and is a real steal at $9.99. I'm 36 and I love this game and it's also a favorite of my six year old. The description tells you what the game is like but I'd like to add a little. The controls are very intuitive and it's easy to pull off some really impressive tricks. The locations in the game are really varied. The soundtrack is excellant. And best of all, you get that trademark Japanese wackiness. This is probably my favorite of the 30 or so Dreamcast games we own. Buy this if you have a Dreamcast. I can't believe this wasn't ported to other systems."
4,"Original, a new concept.","Rather than re-hashing a genre that was old 5 years ago, SEGA has created something entirely new and fresh, and they have succeded.They took a risk and pulled it off.In Jet Grind you are a hoodlum/skater/dancer type who rollerblades around in beutifully animated environmentsm spray painting everything from police chiefs to playground signs.You can also create your own graffiti(nothing to ellaborate, but still cool)and that adds to the replay valua.The characters are so beutifully animated in fact you'll spend at least 30 minutes of play time just staring at Tab or Beat wondering how they could make it look so good.This game isn't good for any one real reason, it's just so totally funny , crazy, and original that you have to love it.Check it out."
4,"Weird, but good.","This game is pretty strange. The entire point seems to be skating around, spray painting stuff. It sounds boring, but it is fun. Though... it's still very weird."
4,"Fun, most of the time","First off, i have to say that I loved the music in this game. All types of music in different languages. Wow.Now the game was pretty fun. Lots of tricks to perform and a variety of levels to keep it interesting. My complaint is with the difficulty of the later levels. Good grief, some are near impossible.That however is minor and doesn't affect the game too much.Story: 4/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 8/10Fun: 7/10"
4,Pissing off cops has never been so much fun!,"I'll make this review short.The graphics are increadable with cel-shaded models (for that cartoon look) and has 5 huge cities with little slowdown at all. Fun to play, easy to beat (but I'm glad to go though it another 3 times), and has one of the best soundtracks this side of the planet. At $(...), I see no reason why you shouldn't go to the local store and pick up a copy. Don't buy this if you plan on doing your homework."
5,wow!,This is a great game for almost all ages the only thing really wrong with this game that makes it bad is the constant cursing of the police and and other people after you and I need help beating the first cube and combo level
4,great fun,"This game is all based around the element of fun. The game cannot be taken seriously. This game seems to be a cross between tony hawks and crazy taxi, which i think is a good thing as i have like both of those games. This game has a high novelty factor at first but it soons wears out as does your tolerance towards the gaming controls. Overall its worth buying if you just wanna have a bit of fun."
5,OMG! Sega is dominating in terms of quality games.,"Once again Sega has released another killer game for their Dreamcast system, and it's awesome as hell. The game is just so fun to play yet so simplistic. THe graphics are just...really, really nice looking. I mean, it looks like a really well-animated alternacartoon or something. The controls are tight, the gameplay is a blast, and even the music (mostly J-Pop, while the New York stage has a Rob Zombie track), is great. All I can say is that with games like these, Sega currently has the market at the moment when it comes to solid fun to play games. This game is one of the reasons to own a Dreamcast."
3,"Fun but, over too quick",Jet Grind Radio is one of the the best games ever... while it lasts. It kept me hooked for about 2 days! After I beat it I played for about 2 more days and felt no need to play more. RENT IT.
4,Close but no cigar,This is a pretty good game that I would recomend to most people. The bad part about it is that you have a small time limit and the tasks it wants you to do are very very hard. This is a chlenging game. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5. An 8 and a half out of ten.
3,3/5,First of all I'm going to say this game is awesome I would have given it a 5 but there are a few little problems I had with it. I'm still going to say that if you have a Dreamcast go try and find this game. If you don't have a Dreamcast but you see a copy of Jet Grind Radio and you have a few extra bucks pick up the system and this will be one of the only games you will need in fact so far it's the only game that I own.(I bought it for $10 Canadian and I'm not sure what the exchage rates are right now.)
3,Lots O' Fun,"If you want to just sit back and enjoy some mindless sci-fi fun, this is the one for you. It's silly,with lots of low-budget effects...a hokey script...and a great time for all. By no means is it a 5-star flick, but it has the punch and humor to entertain...entertain...entertain. Reminded me of the films of the 60s...but there was no one that emulated Carmen back then."
1,Monstrously Bad,"Expectations for this movie were low. Carmen Electra, bad stop motion animated monsters, juvenile story. Still, even going into it with low expectations, this movie was worse than I could have imagined. Take the very worst episode of ""Land of the Lost"" that you ever saw. Make the effects worse (yes, worse than Grumpy the Dinosaur). Now put Carmen Electra into it. There you go, that's Monster Island.There are cave men, giant insects and a sleestack. Actually, I think the sleestack is supposed to be a Pirahna-Man, but it looked like a sleestack to me. I used to like ""Land of the Lost"" when I was 5 years old, but I have a feeling that even 5 year olds would find this movie insulting."
2,Problems with Bodum Electric Vacuum Coffee Maker,"I bought this machine over a year ago and it started breaking almost immediately. The plastic top to the pot was the first to go and there's no replacement parts available at all except for the strainer. The dangerous part of the machine was that after owning it a couple of months, one day I brewed the coffee and suddenly it started boiling again and rebrewing on its own. If you left one of these unattended, it could be potentially dangerous. I love the coffee, we still use the pot, broken lid, electrical problems, and all, but I'm not surprised I can't find it on the market anymore. We developed a habit of immediately turning the pot off after brewing to avoid the reboiling defect and I was actually going to try and buy another one, hoping that the electrical problems were just a fluke, but they seem to be gone. I contacted Bodum about the electrical issue and was never responded to."
2,Great coffee - poorly made machine,"I've owned this coffee maker for over a year. There's no question that it makes excellent coffee, once you get the hang of it, but it uses an insane amount of coffee. So be prepared to spend an awful lot of money on coffee beans with this one. For me, I'm willing to put up with that for a really good brew. But my real problem with this machine (and my reason for writing this review) is that while it is an excellent design, the manufacturing seems to be second rate. After about 6 months the electrical unit on the machine burned out. I called Bodum and they said the replacement part was back ordered. After waiting about 6 weeks I called them again and they finally sent me a whole new coffee maker. Now, 6 months later, another electronics malfunction is causing the thing to boil over about one in four times that we use it. Frankly, I'm fed up and I'm going to buy anther machine altogether.Bottom line - great design, great coffee, very poorly made."
3,"Great coffee, short life span.","I purchased the Bodum Santos two years ago after researching all types of coffee makers. The other reviews are right - the coffee taste amazing and it is a really cool coffee making process to watch. However, the coffee pot is nearly impossible to clean thoroughly and the odd shaped top portion was hard to store when not in use.Ours mysteriously quit working about six months ago and since we purchased it online, there isn't any way to repair it.I'd say save your money and just buy the old fashioned Bodum French Press - its about a quarter of the price with all of the flavor."
3,Pollini is steely and unsympathetic to Bartok's idiom,"My admiration for Pollini is so great that it pains me to point out when he has a misfire, but this pairing of the Bartok Piano Ctos. 1 & 2 finds him hammering away with steel fingers, blunt rhythms, and zero feeling for the Hungarian flavor of these two works. Abbado and the Chicago Sym. are in good form, but they too cannot compete with the idiomatic style of Frerenc Fricsay on DG (who unfortunately leads the RIAS Sym. Orch., an ensemble much inferior to the CSO, not to mention that DG's 1960s sound is dull and tubby). On this disc, the sound is harsh on top, making me bewildered at how the lead reviewer could find it one of the best recordings he's ever heard. If I were to choose the best collection of all three Bartok piano concertos, I'd plump for Stephen Kovacevich and Colin Davis on Philips, and unlikely pairing perhaps but one that comes through with great rhythmic dynamism and imaginaiton."
1,Too flimsy to be shipped,"This arrived from Amazon in a VERY big box - but loose, with very little packaging, and the box had been squashed. End result was a crushed portfolio, which also had a tear on it as if a label had been removed.Even in a local art-supply store these were crushed and torn. They're way too flimsy to be shipped (just a heavy envelope really) and too thin to put much weight in. Perhaps for storage they might have limited use, but I wouldn't carry any work anywhere in it. I returned the damaged portfolio."
5,just what I needed for some art work,"great - inexpensive way to carry art prints without rolling them up. I had a hard time finding the larger sizes, was happy to see I can get them here."
1,Don't waste your money,The glue that held it together came lose and the whole thing just fell apart. Don't waste your money. I had it for 2 weeks.
4,interesting and beautifully dreamlike,"The effects weave elaborate backdrops, miniatures and an unusual Jules Verne storyline to create a magical and dreamlike environment. The nieviety of the storyline adds a humorous twist to the overly dramatic events. A lovely movie with effect being used in modern independent art films."
3,"Fun,but long","This set is fun but it took me three hours to finish the whole thing. There are three parts to it. The front, back, and platform. Each took me about an hour to build. It is a realy nice set though. It comes with ron, harry, and hermiony. All in all I like it but unless you want to spend alot of time on a set, I wouldn't reccomend it."
5,Totally organized for 2006!,"I have purchased Amy Knapp's organizer for the past several years and find it an inexpensive tool that helps keep me on track.The spiral bound book starts with the August 2005 and runs through December 2006. Includes a weekly day by day calender and a month at a glance calender. Also includes a handy tear off sheet to list groceries with menus on the opposite site.The back of the book has spaces to list names and addresses, stickers for birthday and other reminders and a place to write information for the babysitter.I use the book to notate my workouts and calories also jot down ""to do's"" in the space given (which is next to each week).The one draw back is the lack of date tabs to quickly flip to the month. I picked up a set of tabs at an office supply store and transfer them from one year to the next.Overall great calender. Super for keeping me organized!"
2,just a repeat,I was misinformed about this CD. I thought this was new music but it's just a repeat of other Kitaro CD's.
1,YAWN,"I am so tired. I can hardly stay up. Am I in a sushi restaurant? I can't keep my eyes open. Have I been sedated? No, I am just listening to Kitaro the most boring artist around. No songs just wind chimes, delicate bells and synthesizers. He must be a real hoot live! This could be used as an alternative to anaesthesia.Hey, I'm listening to his best song, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
4,morality and magic can go together,"Diane Duane's series tackles some issues of good/evil and the harder decisions that a child could have to make if she were learning about wizardry. What Duane doesn't focus on are the more mature issues of sex or emotional envolvement that children find boring or confusing.I read the books years ago, and bought the box set for my 10-year-old niece. My niece is interested in magic and fantasy reading, and is a very strong reader, but she is still a child. These books are a challenging read with challenging concepts, but not age-inappropriate topics."
5,A Book For All Ages,"This is one of my favorite books. My son, now 22, brought this book home from preschool. He really enjoyed it. As an adult I ""read"" much more into this book. If you would do anything to help someone, regardless of the consequences, you'll love this book.A book for all ages. Very touching!"
4,Works fine for me with old Radio Shack gear,"I bought this remote a few weeks ago to replace an old Radio Shack plug-in 4-switch controller. It works fine with my old R.S. keychain remote receiver and light modules, and is more convenient than the old wired controller since it can move around.One minor complaint, though, is that the dimmer seems to work in discrete stages rather than being continuous like the wired controllers, i.e. one quick push of the dimmer button results in a larger change than I would like. And holding down a dimmer button also changes in large steps, with a change, pause, change, pause, etc. So it can be tricky to set the exact brightness you want. Not a big deal, just slightly annoying. Also, the remote doesn't have buttons for ""all on"" or ""all off"", which were occasionally useful on the old controller."
4,Plam Remote,"This is a great product, worked jsut as I thouhgt it would I replaced one that was older from Radio Shack."
5,Solid and reliable,It's build solid remote works great. I have a couple around my house to control the lights and circuits. Reliable
2,Disappointment,"I have remotes, transceivers, and modules in every room in my home. The remotes only worked with the modules in one room not in every room as advertised. The remotes do work fine in my living room, but I can't turn on my bedroom lights which lights my hallway enabling me to see as I go to my bed. The technicians didn't help either."
1,Customer Service Stinks!!!,"I filled my house with these products thinking that it was great. The system worked okay until one day the $13 transceiver went out. I called customer service and they said that they would replace it but it would take two weeks after they received the part. A month later they still have not got the part to me... They sent it to the wrong address once and I informed them of there error and they assured me that it was fixed. Well it wasn't... Anyway not to bore you with this, my opinion is if you want a cheesy system then buy it, don't plan on using the warranty or customer service though."
3,"Good voice, positive music, but why the fake silicon reggae?","Let me start with the positive remarks: Lucky Dube has a great voice, inspired lyrics and a energetic attitude with a message. But through this all, and through his singing technique and the use of the musical instruments, he is so unmistakenly and typically South-African (or African in general) that I really cannot put this in my library with the real Reggae music. I like my Reggae music pure; this sounds like a Frenchman singing the blues, if you get my reasoning. Conclusion: this is pure South-African under a Reggae-ish blanket. Lucky Dube, come out from under that blanket and show your real self (which is not Rasta)."
3,Lacks important things,"On the good side, the book is fairly cheap and the translations are good. There are weird editorial choices, though. While such an anthology is presumably for use by undergraduates, there is none, none, of Aristotle's Poetics. I think that would be much more useful than, say, the Posterior Analytics, which it does include. And while one of the reviewers here on Amazon (oddly) says that it includes all of Aristotle's Physics, Metaphsics, and Nicomachean EThics, that is false: it contains only selections, and some of this are again peculiar. For example, in Nicomachean Ethics Book X the argument that pleasure can't be the good because pleasure only completes an activity is left out--the selections for Book start at ch. 6, so the whole discussion of pleasure is missing. So, while I've used this book for several years I'm gong to switch to something else,even though that will be more expensive, as I'm tired of having to xerox or put on line the Poetics and the rest of NE Book X."
4,interesting textbook,"i purchased this as a textbook for my intro to philosophy class. it was really interesting and i liked that everything was compiled into one book. as a college student who doesnt have much money for books, it is a good choice when learning about multiple philosophers during one semester"
5,PROMPT SERVICE,I am very pleased I received this item in great condition and not too long after I had placed the order. Love Amazon!
3,Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy: From Thales To Aristotle,"I am not personally reading the book, it was ordered for my son who is attending the local Community College. But I can say that the book arrived in a timely fashion."
3,Decent war game,This game is okay. You play the role of a Mech joke in a war between two island deweling nations.Basicly your the great hero that is suppose to lead your nation to victory.My main compliant is how easy it was for a giant mech to be taken down by enemy tanks. Around six hits will do it I belive. Also your viechle can bearly fly makeing it tought to race to the front and fend off tanks then fly back to base to stop bombers.But other than that the game is great. Your base will send out tanks and infantry as long as the right buildings are there as well the enemy base. Tank out there production buildings to hurry your sides victory.The story is VERY lineal. Win or lose. If you win with all side missions accompliesed you get a harder version of the next mission if you want.That's about this game in a nut shell.
2,Stereo install kit,"This installation kit did not work with my Pontiac. You have to buy an extra piece to address the depth issue with a normal size radio. They should make this info easier to find out, as I had to open the package and find out from the instructions that I didn't have enough stuff to install the radio. The back of the package indicates that this will fit my make and year of car, but that was not the case."
3,Slippers Review,"Overall a good product. The massaging function does not provide a massage beyond simple vibration. When the batteries are inserted, the added weight makes the slippers feel very heavy on the feet."
2,Broke the first use!,"Hi, buy your product a few days ago and the first use broke. I really like this product but not this time."
3,Okay,It is a very good gun but I had air leakage the first year and was hard to locate a repair that was close. laid on shelf for a year and a friend sent it off. working well ATM
4,tai chi music,The music is very appropriate for use when practicing tai chi. The cd came quickly and in good shape.
1,Mind bendingly awful,"Whatever you do, don't buy this product. Don't even accept it as a freebie. Palm are trying to cut corners with this dreadful idea. The protectors are nothing like the old ones, which were made for your specific palm. You'd be better off coating your screen with bits of sticky-tape!"
2,Hate the packaging,"The screen protectors do what they're supposed to do--protect the screen. However, the proctectors were easier to use when they came in different sizes for the different PDA models, and didn't require cutting the size to fit. There's also no reason for the packaging, which is a nuisance to open."
4,Their good,"After you cut them out they work well, very clear, sometimes I forget they are on the screen. I put one on my Zire 72 and Palm TX, excellent product."
1,Easily Scratched w/Very Limited Lifespan,"You'd think that a Palm screen protector from Palm would be best in class. However, these Palm ""premium"" screen protectors have a lifespan of about 3-4 days at best. I'm very careful with my new Palm TX, yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input. I also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size. I've tried an Invisible Shield screen protector, and it was tough as nails; the problem was that installation was difficult, and the tacky surface also produced input errors. Next I'm trying a Boxwave ClearTouch. I never had this sort of problem with the old Fellowes WriteRight protector, which lasted a year or more on my old Palm m130."
1,Questionable Protection,"I purchased these protectors to prevent my screen from being scratched as happened with my old Palm Vx. It does a great job of protecting the screen and looks good. However, a few weeks later, my T|X stopped working correctly. The screen would not react to the stylus and everything was scrambled. I couldn't use the device at all. I called Palm support and the technician helped me to get my Palm working correctly again. The reason for the problem?--the screen protector. In the future, I will not use these protectors and just be more careful so I don't scratch the screen."
3,screen protectors review,"i guess the idea of screen protectors is pretty good, but these came with no explanation as to how to use them, such as an estimated life span, certain preferable ways to pt them on etc."
5,Great protectors and easy to install.....,I recently purchased these screen protectors for my Z22 and was able to install one in about a minute. Not difficult at all. Unlike another reviewers comment there was a sizing chart for the Z22. Anyone with an ounce of finger control should be able to put one on without any problems. Just follow the directions and it will go on easily.
1,DON'T BE FOOLED,"I was seduced by positive reviews into buying this inept piece of contrivance. Don't be fooled. The naked girls are o.k but nothing better than you might expect to find at some amatuer strip night, they have very little screen time.Oh dear I hate this train wreak dreck, no horror no style, probably the most boring collection of random jump-cut nothingness I have ever seen !Worse still the men who appear in this belive they are being humourous, if only they were. The last laugh is their's if you get suckered into parting with your hard earned green.I love low / no budget expliotation movies, I have a collection of many hundreds, never ever have I seen anything as poor as this.As a far better alternative I recommend H.G Lewis's superior ""Blood Feast 2"" unrated edition"
3,Typical of its Time,"When younger (I'm 83) I really enjoyed Lowell Thomas' Books, as I also enjoyed pulp WWI magazines like G-8 and his Battle Aces. But just as many of the old Black and White films that I enjoyed when younger now seem corny on TCM, Lowell's ""With Lawrence in Arabia"", in my mind, retains a little too much of the ""pulpy style"" of Journalism of the 1920's and 30's."
5,A genuine classic,"Now how could a combination of Lowell Thomas and Lawrence go wrong? Lawrence was one of most colorful character of WWI, and Thomas was, perhaps, the best reporter and writer of the era. Not only does this book capture Lawrence in the original, it beautifully describes the history of the war, the politics, and the major players. These details have helped me understand a great deal about why the Middle East is the hotbed of political turmoil that it is today.Don't miss this book if you are at all interested in WWI, the politics and modern history of the Middle East, or just plain excellent writing."
3,This is the book that made the legend,"Lowell Thomas is almost solely responsible for the creation of the Lawrence of Arabia myth. He spent a certain amount of time (during WWI) in the desert with Lawrence, reporting his actions to the media hungry American public. Following the war, he toured the world giving speeches and slide shows about his time with Lawrence. Thomas basically rehashed his tour (by the same name) and put it into book form.Although a highly interesting work, for the serious student of war, this book has little value."
2,"Good, but Dunlop is better","I bought these balls to start Tennis with my 4 year old. I already had one Dunlop SpeedBall. The Gamma balls look exactly like the Dunlop ball, so at first thought the same company manufactures them. But on direct comparison the Dunlop ball is noticeably firmer in the core and has a higher bounce. I can still use these balls, but next time around I'll buy all Dunlops."
2,Tennis balls,"These balls are okay. They don't have alot of bounce. We were given a Wilson foam ball from a tennis pro at the tennis club, and it plays much better."
5,Super Duper,"This product is amazing. Highly recommended. My equipment is all down in my basement, and I can control all of it from upstairs with this product."
5,Great Product,"I bought this repeater so I could move my video and audeo components to the basement. It works great. It was a little difficult getting the tips to stick to the equipment, but other than that, it works every time perfectly. A great buy."
5,Great Item - Well Engineered - Superior Customer Service,"I accidentally checked out with 2 instead of 1. One email to Home Controls fixed the problem.The Hot Link XL works great. I'm not a DIY type, but I had this working in minutes."
2,"5 star on the idea, 2 star on implementation","This system works great initially, but the plastic spray gun has a couple of significant flaws.The soap container leaks badly. So if you leave any soap in it when you're done washing, you're going to have a mess to clean up.The gun slowly starts leaking more and more until you end up getting more water on yourself than your vehicle.The soap/filter combo does a fabulous job though. No drying necessary and no residue or mineral deposits left on the vehicle."
1,Refills no longer available,It's clear from otherMr. Clean AutoDry Car Wash System Starter Kitreviews that P&G; are no longer selling the refills andother soaps DO NOT WORK. How can you still be selling this kit? It'sGillette marketing in reverse!William
3,AutoDry system,"This introductory system works, a handy applicator (squirt-er, soap applicator and deionized water rinse. Problem is that it has been discontinued so access to refills are subject to warehouse supplies. The manufacturer is also very optimistic about the number of washes the little deionized cartridges will accommodate. At the prices of available cartridges I will not re-order."
4,Don't use the soap applicator,"Works more or less as advertised, but just use the filtered water feature. The soap applicator doesn't generate sufficient suds to feel like the car is getting clean. Instead, mix a good car washing detergent in a bucket and wash your car as normal, rinsing with the applicator set on faucet water, keeping the car wet until the whole car has been washed and rinsed thoroughly. Then set the applicator on filtered water and go over every inch of the car systematically. Let the car dry in the shade as others have mentioned or do the process at twilight, and there will be no spots. I live on a dusty gravel road and sometimes knock the dust off with the faucet setting and then rinse will filtered water, saving a complete wash effort."
3,"Great results, but essentially just useful for the filter","I have used this for over a year and have been able to get good results on a dark car. Essentially, the only real useful part of this is the water filter that you use to rinse at the end to avoid any watermarks. With time, the hose connection will start to leak and spray all over you. The soap is OK and really any car wash soap can be used. The key is the filter. They are expensive but I have had them last a dozen washes or so with careful use."
2,Never Let you car/truck dry or you'll have water spots!,"We've been using the Mr. Clean AutoDry for about a year and results are mixed. If you apply the soap, wash, heavy rinse then filtered rinse then wipe the car/truck dry, then it works ok. I can dry it before the spots appear. But you cannot just wash/rinse/filtered rinse or just rinse and let dry or you'll get water spots. This happens regardless of whether you have a new filter or old filter. This has been a very disappointing product. We get a lot of tree pollen/seeds and I was hoping I could use the Mr Clean AutoDry to just rinse off our trucks and then let them air dry but it never works right. We always get some water spots and then you have to spend a lot of time cleaning/waxing the truck to get them off. If you have a new vehicle or one with an good paint job then be very careful about letting it air dry after washing/rinsing with this product."
1,Extremely poor quality; failed within 3 washes,"I purchased my Mr Clean AutoDry Car Wash System about 6 months ago. I've used it a total of 3 times. When I went to use it this most recent (and last time) I found that the internal seals had failed, the soap had leaked all over the inside of the case and out onto my garage shelving, and the sprayer no longer worked properly. Would not purchase again."
2,Mr. Clean and White Car does not Mix,"This Product has its ups and down. I used this on my White Car and it did not do such a wonderful job. The Soap is Weak and left my car with clean spots mixed in with dirty streaks where you scrubbed with a sponge. But the No Towel dry does work but not so well, there are still some spots with water marks. All together i give this product 2 stars because it did not leave my car Clean, good thing this did not cost $70.00 and Up.Also This product waste a lot of water when cleaning your car.I recommend the old bucket and sponge wash over the MR. Clean, What can I say, the Old Bald Guy Failed me."
3,You can find filter refills if you look on Amazon/Ebay...,"I gave this product 3 stars, even though when I have used it (twice so far), I've had excellent results. I took 2 stars off in that P & G should have supported the product with replacement items for longer than they have. I do agree with an earlier review, that the best thing about the kit is the filter and the ability to rinse virtually spot-free. I was smart enough when buying it to pick up a couple of spare filters/soap refills, but when looking around recently, I saw there were no more to be had. I did find them on E-bay and here on Amazon for around $9 each. However today I stopped at an Odd-Lots and saw the whole kit selling for $4. I bought all six that they had on the shelf! If you are looking for replacements, check out your local Odd-Lots."
1,Mr. clean auto dry,"very disappointed, I brought it as a bithday gift for my friend and when she used for the first time, she discovered it was defected,so I returned it."
1,Item no longer manufactured,"After ordering and receiving this item, I had a question and called the 800 number. According to the person on the other end, this item and the filters have not been manufactured by Mr. Clean since December 2009. As the filters are no longer available and there are no other manufacturers for them, we had to return the item. Too bad because other people who have had them swear by them and we were willing to try them out."
1,Can't get replacement DI cartridge!,"This was a great product...until they discontinued the supplies. Amazon's still selling the soap but the DI cartridges can ONLY be had by buying a starter kit...which, of course, is ridiculous!"
1,Can't Find Filter Refills,"Bought this kit recently at the recommendation of a friend, and the system works brilliantly. Washed three cars with it, and the lack of water spots was a very pleasant surprise. Even if the water evaporates on the windshield, there were no spots!The unpleasant surprise was that local auto shops no longer carry the filters, and the filters cannot be purchased alone on amazon.com. I found a rumor that filter production has been discontinued. This is, no was, a very good product, but without the filters, this system is just rubbish."
1,Horrible,"Have tried two different units over the years. Both were horrible. The unit always leaks soap both when in use and sitting. While you wash, soapy residue drips from the orifices and the deionized spray is so slow that you could wash the car and dry it three time before you can rinse it off with the spotless rinse. Useless!"
1,Did not work for me!,"This product was a total bust for me. I have a new, dark colored car and wanted to give it a try to see if it saved me from hand drying it to prevent spotting. It did not.The special rinse at the end to stop the spotting stopped working in a few minutes, well before finishing the car. The cartridge turn brown showing is was expended in under 5 minutes--not the 10 car washes claimed.I also found that the soap dispensed was not very effective at cleaning, and with no bucket, it was difficult to rinse the sponge well.If it worked, it would have been a nice convenience.I will be either returning it or calling the Mr. Clean people to get a refund."
1,Poor recording,"I very much enjoy the music of Bert Kaempfert and bought this CD with great anticipation. I was very disappointed. While the band does a decent job of recreating the Kaempfert sound, in many spots the recording sounds like it was done in a barrel. It is a ""live"" recording, and one should be prepared to make some allowances, but this is just terrible. My advice is to buy the re-issues of the original works, and avoid this CD like the plague."
3,Na Leo Pilimehana Anthology I,"This is my favorite Na Leo CD. Unfortunately, buying it used wasn't so great. It came with black fingerprints on the gold CD that wouldn't even wash off! Both the CD and the case look bad but at least it plays ok. Very disappointed about that."
2,Not too bad for a cheap CD,"Remember, it's only $4 or so. The musicians themselves are great but the quality of the CD is lacking. Sounds like it was recorded on a tape player in Mexico and then transferred to a CD. If you're looking for one CD to own for traditional Mexican music, you may want to consider something else. On the other hand, if you're adding to your Mexican collection, this one's not bad."
5,Excellent Book to Learn How to Increase Fitness Naturally,This well written and beautifully illustrated book made me think seriously about my sedentary lifestyle by showing me architecture designed to keep people more fit. The author convinced me that we should build our homes and offices to be better for the environment and appealing to us visually while invisibly increasing our physical activity. I highly recommend this thought provoking book.
2,I got suckered by cool pictures,"I got got! LOL!! I thought that there would be some real concepts in this book to inspire me. Negatrino on that one! ""High Fit Home"" Really...."
4,as expected - good buy,"Great sunglasses. Perfect fit. exactly what i was looking for. Not a ""true mirror"", but sufficient enough for the cost. Several friends have been looking to get the same pair."
3,Nice Glasses. Used as a Costume Prop,"Glasses were fine for my purpose as a prop. Would not recommend them as an ""official"" pair of sunglasses. Too dark and not polarized."
1,Do Not Buy These Glasses,"I knew that for less than 3 dollars i wouldn't get much out of it, but I bought these for that 1% chance that the sunglasses might be half decent.These glasses are TERRIBLE quality. Most of the images posted for this item are false advertising. The customer images are mostly fake as well. The sunglasses are made up of the lowest quality plastic you can think of and then it was coated in cheap paint to look like metal.My guess is most of the reviews for this item are FAKE.Don't buy these, even for 3 bucks it's not worth it."
2,Don't expect too much...,I was expecting to be the glasses from the 1st pix. It turned out to be the glasses from the 2nd pix. It's pretty bad as I cannot adjust to fit to my face. It will crack the lens if I attend to expand the frame...
5,awsome,"Freaking sweet sun glasses!!! They arrived within 3 days with standard shipping, and when I opened the package I inspected them, come to realize that there wasn't a single scratch on them, and that I got high quality aviators at such a great price makes me feel great, highly recommend these sunglasses"
1,scratches,"I got it with scratches on it, I didn't return it, is not worth the return, but it is waist of money."
1,poor quality,"Very poor quality. I should have known better, but thought I would give it a try. I would not purchase this item again."
2,You get what you pay for,"The glasses are way smaller than they look in the picture. Too small for an average guys face (The only thing that really annoyed me about this product). The quality is pretty bad as well, but you get what you are paying for. They look call but don't fit. Not that great of a trade off."
2,Nice looking..,"these glasses are very nice looking, but broke the first time i took them off..the lenses popped out..tried to put them back in, and they just keep popping off."
2,Cheap Imitation,Do not buy these glasses from Yagoozon since they were not the real thing and were cheap knock-offs. The size was very small and they barely fit behind my ears. They were very inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Disappointed.,"I was really excited about these! But once receiving them, one of the lens wasn't completely set into the frames, and they were bent. Also, they are VERY dark, just fyi. The look is fantastic, but the quality was poor. But I guess thats my fault for not spending more money."
4,"Excellent, but contains lead.","The build, reflective, and overall quality seems to be good for something so cheap. As long as you don't drop it, there shouldn't be any problems from everyday use.However, there was a label indicating that the product contains lead and may lead to birth defects.I'm not so sure about it anymore."
2,"Terrible quality, incredibly flimsy.","These things are EXTREMELY flimsy and mine came so out of whack that after 10min of trying to make adjustments so they wouldn't sit on my head at an angle I give up. If you're buying them for a costume or something they'll be fine but I think they are terrible for everyday use. They might be metal but they're so delicate it feels like they're made out of plastic. Overall these glasses are just ""ok"", even for $5."
3,Good n cheap,"I bought a pair like these in NY and they got beat to hell. I didn't want to spend a lot so I got these in a the mirrored look and brown, They don't do much for UV protection, but they look nice. So on a cloudy bright day their good. Other than that they just look pretty."
3,Okay,I give this about a 3 star. The fit is pretty good but the lenses are WAY to dark. Can see but just dark.
5,"great eye protection, but cheap quality",i got the glasses on the day it was set to be delivered. the glasses has a really heavy tint and has a mirror looking effect. there good for driving and look stylish. the quality is very cheap the frame is plastic and so is the glasses itself. for the price it's worth trying it out. my eyes are very sensitive to light and the glasses does a fantastic protecting my eyes.
1,Crap,i just bought these glasses and when i received these sunglasses they were bent. the ear peice was very bent and 1 of the nose peice was bigger then the other nose peice. so i was trying to bend the ear peice for it to be normal and it broke. i didnt even get a chance to wear these sunglasses because i received it all crappy. all bent and nose peice bigger then the other. it was a waste of time money and excitement. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,you get what you pay for....,pros: glasses are mega dark. Reflective. LOOK GREAT. Fit great.cons: reflective glass easily gets damaged. The frame bends easily as well.
2,small for my head,"These are kinda crappy, they feel like they're going to break. They are also really small for my head. My head is big but they barely reach my ears. I would suggest not buying sun glasses off the internet."
1,"recieved broken, will return for new pair. hopefully better next time.",got these on a special online offer. received broken but contacted company and told me to return them and they will replace free of charge. i will also be reimbursed my return shipping fee. hopefully better next time.
1,poor quality,My husband ordered this and they were definetely flimsy and cheap they broke I believe within the first 2 daysdefinetely would not order again or advise others too
2,You Get What You Pay For,"While these glasses looked fine, the tint was much much too dark for normal use. The fact that the glasses seem as though they were meant for use on the surface of the sun should have been made very clear. However, they were very cheap and were promptly delivered so I guess I can't complain."
2,"The glasses are alright, nothing to get excited over....","i received the product in the standard 3-5 business day range, and was disheartened to see the shape they were in.the glasses were bent in 3 different areas, and were much too big for any human face! but seriously, there not worth the purchase if your intention is style, as they are noticeably cheap and of low preparation quality. However, if your intent isa relaxed game of poker with friends, or a paintball match, these will suit you."
2,If only...,"This item arrived at my home broken. It's not worth returning for the 4 bucks I payed for it. If only it would have been intact, the lens was mirrored, it would've been great. Crap."
3,Too big!,"Very big, seems to cover most of your face. If you've got a large head (like, really large) .. then go for it.- D."
3,You get what you pay for,"Cool glasses I started wearing them all the time s a lifeguard, but then they started to stain on the lenses. I kept them clean but they stained more and more and now I look like a huge goof wearing them. I kept them properly and everything. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Look good while keeping your pocket full,"Essentially, these glasses are going to be one of those cases where you get what you pay for. They aren't going to be of Oakley quality, however, they will look sharp and prove to be worth every penny of your investment. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to pay much for a pair of glasses but doesn't want to look like a cheapo either."
1,Dissappointed...,So I ordered these sunglasses and another pair on the same day... I received the other ones quite a bit faster. I was excited to try them on because I thought I would get a good deal... wrong. These practically fell of my face because they didn't fit. The plastic things that go on your nose weren't even so it was lopsided. I am disappointed with my order and plan to return them or give them to someone else.
4,"34% coolness increase, further test results pending","This product made me nearly 34% cooler when worn and 27% when hanging from the lapel, within a margin of error of 2%.Highly recommended to increase coolness between 20% - 30%.Synergistic effects with other coolness increasing items is still being determined, awesome and rad ratios still undergoing testing."
1,Garbage from Yagoozon,"Bought from Yagoozon because the price was right and Prime shipping was available. What a waste of time. Unboxed them 20 minutes ago and have already printed my return label. Shame that Amazon is eating the cost of shipping this trash in both directions. What arrived did not match the product description; the shape was similar, I'll give them that. The mirrored finish was lame, frames were all bent to hell, no cloth bag, etc. Seriously, if you're tempted, make sure you order from someone other than Yagoozon because what you'll get is garbage."
2,"Look okay, but are really cheap. Wont last long.","The glasses i got arent quite as reflective as the picture but are still very shiny. They are VERY cheap tho.. One lense is constantly popping out part way and there is a sharp piece of metal poking out by the nose piece. These are great if you want a pair for your halloween costume but not for every day use. There is a spot on one lense that is not reflective and one of the bows has a kink/dent in it. neither of these make them unuseable but i expected better.Also, i took them off today and put one of the plastic ear pieces in my mouth while i got my keys out of my pocket (about 20 seconds) and the place where my tongue touched the plastic it got a strange tingly/numb sensation. I know they arent supposed to go in your mouth but this is a little worrying none-the-less. I would not buy these again."
2,Bad product fast fracture,Bad product fast fractureI can not believe that one of the most popular products !!!!!!!!!Do not recommend purchase for several reasons .. Including:TenderDifficult cleaningInaccurate sizes ..
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"I BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND I WAS SO EXCITED WAITING FOR THEM AND WHEN THEY FINALLY ARRIVE SURPRISE !!!!! THEY ARE TOO DARK YOU CAN BARELY SEE THE STREET , AND THEY START TO PEEL THE SECOND DAY BUT WELL I KNOW ITS A 2.00 DOLLARS SUNGLASSES IF YOU WANT THEM FOR JUST ONE DAY THEY R COOL"
2,Low cost and low quality,The item arrived on time and as described. The price was outstanding and I was excited about getting them. They looked very nice upon arriving but after 2 days part the the tint bubbled up and chipped off near the rim. I was pretty disappointed.
2,you get what you pay for,"If this is for a costume then its great, but not good for day to day use, really cheap and flimsy"
1,Cheap. Not nearly cheap enough.,"So, I bought these waiting for the sun. First, it turns out that if you stand in a shadow, you can't see anything. The lenses are awful for walking around, though they might be ideal if you do a lot of welding and hate those masks you wear when you do so to protect yourself from the light. Second, they feel and behave incredibly cheaply. Not cheap as in ""Wow, I can't believe I got these for such a low price,"" more ""I can't believe I paid five dollars for these"". The frame is chinsy and bends altogether too easily. Also, the parts of the frame that fold? They break. Mine were destroyed before I saw the sun. Overall, this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made, and I feel nothing but regret. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
3,"Hey, they're cheap.","Well I expected these sunglasses to be super cheap but what I didn't expect is that they would be totally flat. They stick out from your face so much it looks really stupid, and if you try to bend them back a little they snap. Oh well haha."
3,Not as Mirror-y as expected,"I was buying these for a photography prop, and thought they were going to be a whole lot more mirror-esc ....they're reflective, but i personally wouldn't call them mirrors.BUT beyond that, they got here so fast, were not broken, were packaged pretty safely and definitely good sunglasses if that's all you plan on useing them for. PLUS holy affordable.Over all very good just a little deceiving.But as i said, if you need them quick, if you want them in one piece and want the somewhat sorta mirror effect i'd go with them.But not if you want straight up mirror looking."
2,the price says it all!,the only complaint I have is the big scratch on the left lens I through them right into the trash!
2,Haha Trash!,"I love aviators but these are just trash....There VERY cheap, and not only that but there so dark that you cant drive w them. These glasses are perfect for haloween..."
4,GOOD,"This Product is a really ggo product. If you are looking for glasses that dont produce a glare then these glasses are not good, but all in all these are the best glasses to get regardless of the glare or not. :) enjoyy"
4,great.,"I personally love the stiff handles because it is easier to keep them from falling. They are perfect; cheap and genuine. The only tiniest drawback is maybe the size of the glasses seem a bit small, but the look normal on."
3,Mixed feelings..,"I just got my sunglasses today in the mail. The box was undamaged, inside was a soft felt pouch with the glasses inside. The lenses already had a few easily noticable scratches, but since this is for my Halloween Costume it will have to do. Otherwise then it coming with scratches, they look like a nice pair of sunglasses."
1,If there were 0 stars thats what I would give,"These broke the second we took them out of the box! Piece of crap, not worth the energy to order!"
1,Cheap trash.,"I purchased these sunglasses after seeing all the five-star reviews; but these glasses aren't even worth the low price I paid for them. But if you're looking for shades to stick into snowmen, sit on a dashboard, or just collect dust on top of a desk, these are the glasses for you. ...And paperweights...They make good paperweights too."
1,don't buy,"Just save the 3 bucks and buy a better pair. The 1st pair we bought were scratched so we sent them back. The 2nd pair are bent so we are just going to let our kids play with them. They seem good, I read the reviews that stated they loved thwm, but really they are not. They are very cheap and flimsy."
1,Not as pictured or described,"I was looking for a true aviator-style pair of sunglasses with a true to life mirror finish (like looking in a silver mirror). These glasses are not those. The lens is very dark and reflective, but it is not a true silver mirror finish like you'd see in a mirror in a store. Also, they are sort of aviator-ish, but not really. The nosepiece/bridge thing is straight, not curved as in the photo. I am returning these and will continue my quest for real mirror-looking sunglasses. The photo of the item is very misleading."
3,Decent. Got it at a ridiculously cheap price.,A little darker than I would prefer. Cheaper material but you get what you pay for. My head is pretty big but they still fit.
1,Cheap,"The glasses look fine, but the frame was bent and the lens popped out the first day. The glasses are way to wide to fit my face. I don't like them."
2,Pretty much what you'd expect for $1,"I'll be honest, they look pretty nice. This concludes the positive portion of this review.These glasses are about as sturdy as a paper hat. One of the lenses popped out as soon as I took it out of the box. I managed to get it back in, but it's an ongoing problem. Also, the spring hinges do more bad than good; they're too weak, and when you wear the glasses, you feel like they're going to fall off your face because they sit too loosely. No amount of bending and reshaping of the frames fixed this problem for me.The lenses are perhaps TOO dark. When I drove while wearing these glasses, I found myself unable to read my own speedometer, even when I set the numbers to light up.I'd pass on these glasses if you're going to use them for anything other than a Halloween costume."
3,Cheap and Cheerful...,"These glasses are quite sturdy for the ultra low price,but the lenses do tarnish quickly it appears - hence the 3 star review. I am a huge Aviators fan and wear them often and to be honest, this was a purchase I made late night when extremely tired and probably shouldn't have done so.But again - they do the job. Not the best styling, but still... for the price, a decent product."
2,Way too dark; give me a headache.,"The lenses are way too dark. Only if you're at the beach on a bright, sunny day will they be useful. And if you don't have to look at any particular object for a long time. For everyday use, you have to strain your eyes to see and they end up giving you a headache. I've worn them three times and all three times I've ended up with a headache. They are very good-looking shades and very ""cool."" If you're only interested in the fashion factor then these are for you. In terms of utility, they fail."
2,OK glasses,"They were really nice sunglasses that blocked out the sun really well. But, they are very fragile glasses and broke when they fell off from the top of my head, and I'm only 5'5"""
4,great for price but..,these are great for the price..i realized they wouldn't be as good as an expensive pair but i figured the person i was buying them for wouldn't be wearing them everyday it was more of a gag gift in a way.. but for the price they were great.. the lense did however pop out once but hasn't done it since
1,shipping was great product was not,The sunglasses arrived in the time specifed. The glasses were opened by an Adult and put on and the lens fell out. After replacing the lens several times the sunglasses were throwed away. I would not purchase these again. They would not even make it one day let alone one minute. I am dispointed in the product. I expected cheep due to the price but I could have purchased a pair from a dollar store and they would have at least lasted that day. Between the cost of shipping and the cost of the glasses this was diffinatly not a wise decision.
5,Awesome Aviators at great price!,"I purchased these aviators because they looked like pretty decent quality aviators at in incredible price and am I glad I did. These came packaged nicely, and the glasses are great! Very reflective, nice quality as well. If your looking for a pretty good quality pair of aviator sunglasses, at a great price, you just found them. Ive already ordered a second pair, because my brother likes them just as much as myself."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Purchased the glasses to have a second pair. Wanted inexpensive sunglasses in this harsh, dusty environment of Afghanistan. Very low quality. One of the lenses came-out out on the first hour; worthless. I threw them in the garbage three hours after I received them.If you need a second pair of bargain sunglasses' the SWG UV400- Unisex Aviator are much better choice. Take my advice and do not waste your money."
2,Look good....but are really crap,We received the product and they looked pretty decent and the price we paid was justified. My husband left them in the car one afternoon when it was 77 degrees out. When we got back we saw that the plastic/lens had melted and smeared downward. Now they are in the garbage. They wouldn't have been worth $1 if I had only known.
3,Aviator Sunglasses,"I recieved them super fast and they were perfect, except for the fact that they are really cheap made. I guess I assumed they would be metal but they are a hard plastic material. My only qualm is that they are cheaply made. I got what I paid for and they work so I can't complain."
2,"The sunglasses are fine, they are not very good...","The sunglasses are not as good as they look on the website, they do not have good quality plus they are too big."
5,Sweet shades A+++,"They came within 3 to 4 days after purchasing. They look awesome, feel great, and most of all dont feel cheap. Very pleased with the quality overall appearance. Definately worth every cent!"
3,"Poorly made. Ok for three bucks, though.","It came with a little spot where tint was faded off. At first, I decided I would return it as a manufacturing error, but then thought ""Why bother? It's only three bucks"". However, since then, I've kinda grown to like them. I realized the untinted spot isn't really too visible in the sun. It'll give it three stars, since it was only three bucks."
