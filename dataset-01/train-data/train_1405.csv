1,Bad information,I had to return these (pair) since they did not properly fit the vehicle. The item description listed my make and model vehicle for these lifts but I nearly broke the glass trying to close the rear hatch. These were about an inch too long and VERY hard to compress. A complete waste of time and money.
3,One small problem,"The ease of ordering, and super fast delivery far exceeded my expectations. The problem was that once the pistons were installed, it is almost impossible to close my back glass because of the pressure required."
5,Excellent. William Kent Krueger is an amazing author and I have enjoyed everything he's written. Copper River is at the top.,"Copper River is a fantastic read. I have read all of William Kent Krueger's novels, and have always finished them quickly. I rank this author up there with James Lee Burke."
5,Enjoyed this whole series.,I've enjoyed the entire Cork O'Connor series. I just completed Copper River and have started Thunder Bay. Easy reading and keeps your attention.
4,Great series,"Love William Kent Krueger! Excellent story. The story should be read in the context of the series. Start with ""Iron Lake"" ""Copper River"" is #7 of 13 to date."
3,The Hardy Boys on Steroids,"If it weren't for the swear words and some gore, I'd think this book was written for teenagers. This is one of those thrillers where hardened cops let kids and housewives join in the manhunt for dangerous killers. Ridiculous. And a lot of the dialog is teen talk. And a lot of things just happen coincidentally -- you know, everything's so well-planned that the author can just wrap the book up in a nice little -- albeit unbelieveable -- package. On the other hand, it was fast and light reading, although the ending is simply ridiculous. I think the book deserves only two stars but I'll give it three because I've liked Krueger's other books and it did keep me amused for the time I read it. But it could have been better."
5,Cute,I love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable. The heel is not so tall that you feel like you can't walk. Customer service and shipping was excellent. Best price I could find. Don't hesitate on this purchase. You'll love them.
5,Excellent product but had problems (product incomplete),Good day all! I love how it looks on my celings. But when I opened the boxes where missing some of the screws and plastic ribbons that are placed before the glass. So I had to go to the store and tried to look for something that could do the same funtion as them.
1,Warning! Rip-Opp Zone,"Dissapointed? I sure am. I wish I could have listened to samples of these tracks before I wasted the money. Not one is original. ""New Stereo Re-recordings by the Original Artists."" What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like the old early 70's with the performing group named ""Original Artists"". RIP-OFF! Save your money."
2,Yuck yuck YUCK,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but these are horrible! They look just like Berry Dophilus, which taste pretty good. But these taste like a mixture of concentrated grape cough medicine, grass/herbs (like in all natural vitamins), and dirt.I wanted something without the artificial sugars in Berry Dophilus, and that didn't need refrigeration. Guess I'll keep looking and eating yogurt instead.Update: My husband would like to add his $0.02. ""Ewwwww Yuck. That's disgusting. What is that SUPPOSED to taste like? Just throw them away.""."
5,No more potty accidents,"My son was having lots of potty accidents at the age of 6. Even though he was regular, his doc thought maybe poop in his bowel was crowding things in his abdomen to the point that he couldn't feel when he had to go. Miralax seemed to work somewhat, but I didn't want him on a laxative all the time. So we transitioned to these and he hardly ever has accidents anymore. All my kids love them."
3,Taste too strong,"My daughter scrunches her face every time she has to take these. She will also only take them when she has a cup of water to drink immediately afterward. I thought she was exaggerating, so I tried one myself and they have a very strong flavor (a bit sour as well). I'll be looking for something with a more mild flavor in the future."
4,My picky 6yo loves the taste,"He is picky about everything.. but loves the taste of this probiotic. He actually prefers this over any chewable vitamin I've given him. To me, they seem a little on the chalky side and stick to the back of the teeth.. but I'm sure eventually it all makes it down to the little tummy!"
2,Vs. Lil Critters,"I bought these based on a review where a customer compared these to Lil Critters, which is what we tried, first. My kids (and I) actually liked the Lil Critters, other than the fact that we need a higher count since we were taking four daily. In the review, the customer stated that these were cheaper and tasted better. I thought, ""You can actually make these taste better? Great!"" Yes, they are much, much cheaper, but they taste like it, too. Firstly, when I opened the bottle, fine purple powder flew everywhere. It's all over the cotton ball inside, so every time I get tablets out, I have to be careful of where I set the cotton ball down. They taste more like regular vitamins, which my kids and I have NEVER liked (since we use the AMAZING-tasting SmartyPants). The Lil Critters are just higher quality and worth the money."
2,Not Fresh Enough,"I bought these about a month ago and right away could tell that the probiotics wasn't working. My kids are always very regular on probiotics and I noticed all 3 began to have digestion issues again and were struggling with constipation. I grabbed another brand of of probiotics after 2 weeks and sure enough their stomach issues resolved and they became regular again. I think it might be that the refrigeration process killed the organisms, it came in a cool pack, but no telling where it was before that."
4,Not for those who are subject to depression!,"Waters' novel of British life during and shortly after World War II is, taken in bits, palatable; but I would hate to have to hear it read aloud or read in one gulp. The principal characters are either lesbian women or closet gay men. They go through sheer hell. In the background--and often right on the page--come the bombs and the anti-aircraft, the collapsed houses, incendiaries, ambulances, and dead people. The plot concerns love: hearts broken by treachery, mended by kindness while in prison, acutely damaged by the war. There's lots of detail concerning London during the Blitz, the raids of 1944, and oh yes, the story is told in backflash form--1947 comes first, then 1944, then 1941. A good if subduing read."
4,Excellent writing from an outstanding British author,"For Sarah Waters fans, this is worth purchasing from AmazonUK, where it is already available. With the discount and exchange rate, the cost was about $25. Don't wait until the end of March if you're a fan. It's well worth watching as a master writer of the Victorian Era applies her skill to more recent historical fiction."
3,Falls short for me ...,"Really well written, and obviously well researched. Also the development of the characters is terrific. That stated, I found most of the characters to be navel-gazing, pitiful creatures ... obsessed with their pursuit of happiness in wartime. There is no ""higher purpose"" for anyone. Duncan's father is shown as a hard-of-hearing buffoon, but given his life experiences and his actions to keep things together he's the most commendable character. Since he wasn't gay, however, I guess not worthy of more development. I'm reminded of that John Mellencamp song ... ""when you live for yourself it's hard on eveyone else""."
3,Not her best effort,"I am a tremendous fan of Sarah Waters' work, but this one didn't quite hit the mark. I suppose what you're looking for in a novel may have some part in your overall feelings toward it- looking for the sassy lesbian story? Not so much. Looking for lesbian life to be depicted in an interesting setting? Sure. Looking for a novel about wartime life that is achingly real? Absolutely. But if you're looking for all of those things or need more of one element than another, you might feel disappointed. Perhaps the emptiness I felt at the end of the novel was intended by the author- to match Kay's emptiness or that of the other characters after the war. But I don't think so. I think it reflects an element missing from the novel. I agree with other reviewers who indicated that some of the language just didn't work. A nice read but not the Sarah Waters effort I was anticipating."
3,Not her best work,"Sarah Waters' latest novel is not quite up to snuff compared to her previous works. Not wavering from her style, this novel is an unusual construction. She works backwards by beginning with the end and ending with the beginning. The construction is interesting and the writing is good, but it just does not seem to have a plot. And she never makes us care for her characters. I am holding out hope for her next."
2,"Limited interest, originality","Let me start by saying this is an extremely well written book. Ms Waters is a wonderful writer, I have enjoyed her other work tremendously. This book on the other hand has been written hundreds of times by other authors, with very little to recommend it. It fits neatly in the alternative lifestyle before it was acceptable genre. If anyone else had written this, I prob wouldn't have finished it, but Ms Waters is usually so good I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Pick up another of her usually excellent works instead."
2,Nothing much happens,"While the structure of the book is clever, most of the characters are uninteresting and the moral dilemmas are largely blah. The biggest mystery of all, that of the male protagonist, is not revealed until the very end and, frankly, was not worth waiting for. In addition, scenes are repeated ad nauseam. Take smoking, for example... there seems to be a cigarette scene in every page. And as far as homoerotic love goes, I've read much better tales.I hate to say this because I liked her other books: Leave this one on the shelf unless there's nothing else to read."
2,Girl love,"It's London during the horrors of the bombing raids of 1941 and the lives of a group of women intertwine inextricably.Four lesbian lovers agonise over exactly WHO they love and why, while another silly, stupid young woman continues her affair with a married soldier who gets her pregnant and then deserts her in her time of greatest need, following a botched abortion. Unbelievably, this lame brain girl continues with the affair for years afterwards, wasting her time on this idiot. As is probably apparent, this book made me angry but it's my own fault for reading a Sarah Waters book as she always writes about lesbian themes and if I hadn't been aware of just how much detail of love making she goes into, I certainly do now. Her descriptions of war torn London and of its inhabitants who were reduced to either zombie like fatalism or to quivering, nervous wrecks, are superbly done, but it's all so unhappy that it left me feeling totally depressed."
4,Still a fan!,"Despite the mixed reviews, I really liked this book. I loved that all the characters were so flawed. Sarah Waters will always be one of my favorite authors."
3,Night Watch,"Having read ""Tipping the Velvet"" and ""Fingersmith"", I was looking forward to this new Sarah Waters novel. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. This book does not demonstrate the depth and breadth of her former novels. While it's a good story and I really like the WWII era, it didn't impress me like the other two books mentioned above. The characters were not very interesting and their interactions were relatively dull. Of course, this is Waters' first venture beyond Victorian England, which seems to be her metier, so keep that in mind. I simply expected better."
2,Too little is original,"""Kay Langrish"" of ""The Night Watch"" is too much like ""Stephen Gordon"" of Radclyffe Hall's 1927 novel, ""The Well of Loneliness."" Both women are butch, brave, ambulance drivers, rich, conservative, etc. Coincidence? I don't think so. That's just one example of the lack of originality in ""The Night Watch."" If your knowledge of lesbian literature begins with ""Rubyfruit Jungle,"" Sarah Waters' reliance on earlier sapphic novels won't trouble you--you won't notice. But if, like me, you've read (say) Mary Renault's pre-Alexander books, you'll wonder where the footnotes went."
3,Disengaging,"I really struggled with this book, although of course, I appreciate many aspects of it : its attention to detail, its minute and careful observations, Sarah Waters' forthrightness in choosing homosexual people for most of the principal rles.Its unusual backwards chronology is a gamble and I am not sure it pays off : there is scant sense of closure, and whatever closure there is comes at the end of the first section of the book.For me, the major problem was with the characters : they seemed to me a dreary bunch of also-rans and, as the book is long, the reader needs to invest energy in trying to empathise. This effort, for me, did not seem worthwhile and I was relieved when I came to the end! I felt as if I had been at a party at which all the other guests were people I didn't really want to meet....Did the recurring frequency of the word 'lavatory' strike anyone else??"
3,A bit slow,"This was an okay novel, but left me feeling like it was somewhat lacking. For a story about people living in war time, it seemed a bit dry and slow. Three of the five main characters garnered a majority of the focus, and all three of these characters were quite flawed, which certainly made them feel real, but I still had a hard time sympathizing with them.Not Waters' best work, but perhaps a good place to start if you would rather save the best for last."
4,surpisingly Good,"A Damn good read. It didn't look interesting, but it was. I did like the backwards timeline in the book. It is a good technique for dragging people into what happened to get our characters to where they are at the beginning of the book. Fabulous descriptions of life in London during the war (WW2) and I did like the cast. The women are all strong and survive the best way they can."
4,Too many cigarettes,"My first Sarah Waters book, I really liked the book's structure, intertwining stories that don't completely come together until the end, and the 'being there' in daily life during the war. Only objection -- was it really necessary to have smoking play such a prominent role? Perhaps it is historically accurate, but there are lots of other things about the people that I would have appreciated learning instead of lots of words dedicated to their smoking."
2,A bit disappointing,"I chose to read Sarah's The Night Watch after reading, and enjoying, 'Tipping the Velvet' which was sent to me by a friend. However, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed by this story.The characters, although they are well created and written, are too many and their lives too interwoven for me to have felt anything towards them. As soon as I started to enjoy one part of the story, I was torn away from it and thrust into the middle of another.I did, however, enjoy the style of the writing and how Sarah chose to start from the end and build the story back to the start but the book ended so abruptly that I felt a little dissatisfied by it and I wanted to know more.I enjoy reading about the era and I do like Sarah's tone of writing but I'm afraid there were too many characters for me to truly get involved with the story."
3,Well told period novel,"A well-told story about the intersecting lives of a man and several different women in the 1940's in London. Focusing mostly on the period when London was being bombed regularly during the war. The novel moves back in time, beginning in 1947, and ending in 1941. A story of attraction, love, tragedy, and loss. One character laments something like, ""I pass people in the street and wonder 'What have you lost? And what did you do?'"" As always, a thought-provoking and emotional read."
2,An Unusual Taste Experience,"These weren't just out and out nasty tasting, but not what I expected either. No one else in my family liked them period. These candies have a rather strange taste that is just not very pleasant to me. Regardless, I paid very little for them, so I can at least be thankful for that."
3,One Great Song,"The only reason for buying this CD, was for Johnny Mandel's ""Marina"" Great piece from the soundtrack. The rest of the album doesn't do anything for me."
1,Unwatchable,"Here is my summary what happens in the movie:......That's it. The beautiful scenery of the white background of your computer is chilling. Its a metaphor for the emptiness of the kind of people who want to be thought of as smart for liking ""deep"" movies or movies that ""smart"" critics like."
4,Dead Poets Society meets Blair Witch Project,"It sounds odd, but that's about how this movie plays. More delicate than many of Weir's later films (including Dead Poets), Hanging Rock portrays the way a nameless terror can tear apart a group trying to cope with it -- an effect without an identifiable cause. Hanging Rock is not a scary movie, much less a horror film. Instead, Weir concentrates on the atmospherics of the rock, and later, the dynamic between the characters. Watch the movie not to be scared, but to enjoy Weir's subtle direction, the superb photography, and the mannered script.The newly remastered video release is about as pristine and clear as VHS can get. Although it's widescreen, the aspect ratio looks to be only about 1.66:1, so if you can't find the widescreen, the 1.33 (full screen) version won't look *too* different.DVD owners might be interested in the Criterion edition."
5,A dream within a dream,"About as lyrical as lyrical gets in cinema, this haunting film from director Peter Weir is a masterpiece of ineffable evocation, an enigmatic parable, a beautiful, idyllic nightmare in bright daylight. Music, photography, acting, writing and editing all work together to brilliant effect. The Criterion DVD looks terrific, doing justice to the beauty and detail of the outdoor images in particular.By the way, if you like this film, I strongly suggest you seek out the work of a little-known genius writer named Robert Aickman. This film is very reminscent of his singular body of strange work, and works on your subconscious in a similar way."
5,Some of the best cinematographic work ever from Russel Boyd,"I am an Australian expatriot living in Austin Texas. I love this movie - wihout a doubt one of the best examples of Peter Weir's genious. I tried to find it in the US at all sorts of video stores. Sorry sir - we had a copy but it is lost, stolen, worn out, whatever!! Thank the Lord for Amazon!!! My friend Russell Boyd - the DP on this movie - one of his first - must have been in his early 20's when he made this movie. What a genious!! Russell if you're out there call me. I am working with the Texas State Government to create the Texas Film Development Project and would love to hear from you. I want to produce some films like this one.Terry Lipman Director Texas Film Development Corporation."
1,No...............,"I just saw ""Picnic"" for a great works requirement. I have no idea what just happened. Though the cinematography is beautiful, especially when considering that it was made in the seventies, it's beauty is lost in the fact that the movie is blatantly.......dumb. Two hours of my life were just sucked through my eyeballs. There is no plot, and the dialogue is hideous. There are hundreds of loose ends besides the main storyline, which wanders off in to the middle distance and evaporates, much like the girls on the rock. Everyone goes absolutely insane and starts killing themselves, and there are vague undertones that one of the girls became a swan.If anyone ever walks up to you and says, in a congenial tone of voice, ""would you like to watch'Picnic at Hanging Rock?'""....run. Punch them in the face...and run."
2,"Tedium ad infinitum, avec mademoiselles","""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is a beautifully shot movie about the mysterious disappearance of 4 women on a geologically intriguing exposed volcanic plug. This occurs in the first 35 minutes. It is a slow and steady decline from there on out to the unusual ending an hour later, and requires determination to stick it out.Nice score which includes the pan flute. Nice photography. Mostly pretty women dressed head to toe who use formal proper speech.I don't know what to recommend it for, though. There is no message or answers, here."
2,Boring with a capital B,"What a dull movie.The next time I can't sleep I'll watch this movie.Here's what the movie is about...a group of girls from a boarding school go on a picnic,they eat lunch,then they take a nap,then they get up and go for a walk,they climb some rocks,they take another nap,they get up and start walking again and get lost.Are you still awake? Then for the remainder of the movie people are looking for them but never find them.That's the whole story.Thrilling,isn't it?"
1,My Splean!,"Ok, this movie was a movie, I'll give it that, and that's all. The pretty location was the most exciting part of the film. The plot(?!?) was annoyingly ambigous, the acting was screeching voice-overed, and the headmistresses jiffy-pop hair-do was huge and unreal. I think my cat crawled under the couch and died. I would have noticed if I hadn't fallen asleep."
1,Stepford Girls in soft focus yawner,"I was really looking forward to this, based on other reviews. Once again, I learn that bad reviews are usually the correct ones. How easily duped people are....they believe what they read, if not what they've seen, and the cancer spreads.A thin gruel of Victorian repression trying to achieve psychological Gothic horror....absolutely vacuous performances by the gals; a red-headed kid who looks yanked out of a Disney fishin' hole tale; prop dept. headmistress, governesses, and police; more empty metaphors than a Harry Chapin song; a 70s softcore porn soundtrack of light classics mixed with pseudo-classical processional ditties; laughable devices of ""suspense"" and ""terror""; an overall air of ""if you aren't getting this,we're just too subtle and nuanced for ya""Started this one at about 9:30 PM, which is usually a safe hour for me....nonetheless, I dozed off at least twice, and when the thing was over, I barely trudged upstairs to bed, where I promptly conked out."
1,I Saw A Different Film,"Apparently I saw something different than the rest of you, because this movie is a slasher movie. At least, that's what I wanted to do to my wrists. Utter boredom and no payoff. The best thing about this film was that it broke during the screening."
1,bad... very bad,"Imagine a David Lynch film without the pacing or the special effects. This film is slow to the point of tedium. The acting isn't horrid, but it's hampered by the script. ""Open to interpretation"" is a polite way of saying that the film makes utterly no sense. While David Lynch can make this work, the plodding, droning pace of the film makes one await for denouement that will never come."
5,A work of Art,"People used to laugh at the Australian film industry, and frankly, there had been some stinkers, but this is the one that put them on the map, for all time.Picnic At Hanging Rock, with its stunning cinematography and otherworldly hybridized forays into classical mythology, simply blew everything else out of the water, the year of its release.There have been a number of good reviews, so I won't re-hash anything, I would just implore you to do yourself a favor and see this utter work of Art.I would like to have seen a bevvy of extra features, but this is worth having come what may.It really is as good as you have heard."
5,"Beautiful, atmospheric and quietly haunting...",Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock is nothing less than a masterpiece
1,"Lovely to look at, but silly beyond measure","What good is symbolism and a beautiful atmosphere at the expense of no plot or character development? I am not sure what separates this movie from other sexually-repressed ""girl's school"" flicks, other than pretty white dresses and straw boaters instead of halter tops and short shorts. Other reviewers mention the oppressive heat of the landscape as a metaphor for the oppression of this class-conscious, sexually repressed Victorian setting. No, it's a warning of the oppression, lethargy, and boredom you'll feel at having to sit though this nonsense. Someone should tell the screenwritter that pseudo-profound precognizant banter does not good dialog make. ""Now I know - She's a Bottichelli angel."" To paraphase Dorothy Parker - ""Tonstant Viewer frowed up."""
2,"Haunting, lyrical, soulful, tearful... but boring","Yes, Miranda was quite pretty, and yes, the period customs were compelling, but sometimes we forget that the nature of cinematic drama demands there be a story, a plot which maintains our interest from beginning to end. Aristotle said it first in his Poetics: a drama must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, all of which must contribute to its essence (I paraphrase). Here there was a good beginning but little middle and no end. This movie had too much of lingering scenic mood shots and too little of dramatic substance. People who like this kind of film will probably like ""The Thin Red Line"". Those who, like myself, found TRL pretentious and silly will probably reach for the FF button during this one."
2,"Overrated, pretentious","I came to this film fully expecting to like it because of the many glowing reviews I'd read over the years. While it has its positives (evocative photography; haunting atmosphere; rich, overblown sets; some strong performances) it's essentially a tedious exploration of Victorian psycho-sexual dynamics, seen from a very 1970s perspective. The plot is so lightweight it's constantly in danger of floating away. I had to force myself at regular intervals not to turn it off because of shear boredom.The film leads you to believe it's based on a true story, which, frankly, was one of the reasons I stuck with it. But it's not. The story's a total fabrication, which makes the film even more ridiculous in retrospect.Unless you're a devotee of Peter Weir, Australian cinema, or 1970s costume and hair design trying to look ""Victorian,"" I suggest you watch The Beguiled instead."
3,"nice imagery and music, but that's about it.","i can understand why some would like it and some would hate it. there are some nice pieces of music combined with images, which gives a foreboding atmosphere, but the movie goes no where. i think it's great to use your imagination, but there needs to be a base to build it upon. this film had a few girls getting lost and that's it. in a way this had a similar concept with blair witch, but in blair witch at least you could make your own predictions. there was no background story of the rock that held up. they were just rocks with what looked to be faces in them, oooooo!!!!"
2,And then they rolled the credits.,"The patients in SB2 really enjoyed this film -- especially the catatonics. Of course, it was difficult to differentiate the catatonics from the other patients after the first 10 minutes loped by slower than a manitee on Darvacet. From that point in the film to just before the credits rolled is a blur, since the rest of the staff McLean Hospital and I lapsed into a short-term coma. Thank god for the credits as it was time to re-administer meds."
4,tight cut,"Scarface is One of My Favorite Rappers. Bro Man has deep word usage and he knows how to make you think and keep a flow going. he doesn't over do it either. this cut was a Jam back in the day and I just always dug his flow and overall presentation. His voice always makes you listen. if Face wasn't from the Dirty South then He would get more Juice. because He is One of the Most Underrated Talents to Ever Emerge in the game and He hardly ever gets his fair due. He is One the Best to Ever Roc a Mic.""Smile"" is another jam that cements his Legacy and depth as a Artist."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I just don't get it. Usually, when a book on Amazon has a great rating I find it to be right on. This book completely missed the mark in my opinion. I couldn't even finish it and that's pretty bad. I can usually finish any book but I just found this book quite dull. This book was missing that extra umph that makes a romance juicy.I didn't care for the heroine or for the hero. I couldn't get passed his big nose for some odd reason.I will give it this though. The dialogue was humorous at times but all in all I was highly disappointed."
2,Boring & not a likable hero...,"I stopped around p120. I wanted to like the book. It seemed intriquing being set in Egypt but the writing was just boring. As for the hero, as one other reviewer pointed out, you knew nothing of him except he had a use history of sexual conquests and the heroine was just one other conquest. All his thoughts had to do with undressing her - nothing real deep."
2,"I hate to disagree with the general consensus, but...","I won't say that I hated this book, because I didn't. I will say though that this is much more stereotypical romance novel fare than I enjoy. The reformed rake plot is an overdone one and Chase doesn't even make an effort to mix it up at all. The hero was annoying and his constant misunderstandings/misinterpretations were bothersome to say the least. The heroine was likable enough, and overall it was acceptable, I just don't think it merits the glowing reviews it has here. I didn't even buy it, I just borrowed it from a friend because she said I *had* to read it, avid romance novel reader that I am. When I got on here to see how other people felt, I was shocked by how universally liked it is. I just found the plot and the characters (mainly Dain) to be not wholly believable. Skip this book and read some Kleypas. She has good characters, good sex scenes, and good plot. I highly recommend her work, especially her early stuff."
2,Did I read the same book as other reviewers?,"I got this book from the library based on the smashing reviews here. .my copy of the book was so dog-eared and marked I imagined women poring over this again and again.I will admit to liking our hero,dain,although with a sobriquet such as ` lord of scoundrels' you would expect to see at least some of his conquesting and not simply hear about it by reference. At least I felt he was a well fleshed out (no pun intended) character. I couldn't feel the same way about our heroine at any point during this book. Why was she letting her brother manipulate her so badly? She certainly wasn't helping him to grow up out of his childish behaviour. Jessica does score brownie points in her taking dain's son under her wing but then again so does he. All in all I was not thrilled with this beauty & the beast plot,although I do think dain is a well thought out& interesting alpha male character"
2,Thankfully I borrowed it from the library...,"I honestly don't get it. After reading the positive reviews I thought I would really enjoy this book. The ""tortured hero"" theme is one I have always found compelling. Unfortunately, Lord of Scoundrels left me cold. I finally gave up halfway through--I found the characters totally unlikable, the storyline murky and convoluted, and the whole thing a colossal bore. I liked the premise--I wish I could have liked the book."
3,Okay,"I'm an editor and ghost writer, so I'm not a relaxed reader. I'm wired to find faults. When I first started reading I thought, oh, no, she is head hopping, but I take my hat off to Ms. Chase, she handled it well. (no pun intended) The typos annoyed me. The hero was fairly good and I could feel for him. I found the heroine too miss-goody-two-shoes, she irritated me. And shooting him--seriously? That was OTT. Then she beats the other guy to a pulp when he tries to steal that icon--please! I enjoyed the humor immensely. The plot? a bit predictable, and to make the males look so daft all the time--also OTT. Overall, not the best, but a fairly entertaining read and Ms. Chase writes well."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed!,"This is my first book by Ms. Chase and it won't be the last! This story had it all - wit, humor, romance and a few scenes that tugged at the heartstrings.I won't rehash the entire plot, but suffice to say, this is a ""reformed rakes make the best husbands"" tale.One thing I really like about the book was that the main characters were intelligent and communicative. They didn't just shut down and act irrationally after the usual ""big misunderstanding"". They talked about things and reasoned through why each other was behaving the way they were.The one thing that bugged me about the book was how Dain was constantly refered to the devil - okay, I got it the first 100 times. Also, the fact that Jess calls him Beelzebub bothered me. Didn't seem like a pet name, seemed mean."
5,"Dark, complex hero and smart, plucky heroine go at it!","Dain and Jessica are complicated, fully-fleshed-out individuals who---thank goodness---find each other and finally value the other's worth. A brilliant read and an unforgettable story, filled with humor, originality, and intense romance. Sure, Loretta Chase doesn't flood the market with her books---but she maintains their quality. To quote Spencer Tracy (describing Katherine Hepburn), they're ""cherce!"""
2,Cheesy- Kinda entertaining,"This was my first ""Romance- Romance"" novel and I thought it was cheesy but fun.I saw all the great reviews from Good Reads and Amazon so I gave it a try. I love romance but not this kind of romance. I wont read another one like it. Sorry"
3,Didn't Live Up to the Hype,"I was soooo excited when I ordered this book...it was rated best romance EVER, had a ton of awesome reviews--I couldn't wait to read it! Maybe I had an off day, but I saw no humor in this book at all!! I couldn't get into the book, as hard as I tried...I'm a big fan of Gaelen Foley, Lisa Kleypas, Judith McNaught, etc...this book wasn't on the same level, in my opinion..maybe I need to re-read!"
5,Read it. You won't be disappointed!,"I never write reviews, I mean NEVER. Clearly this book is something special...I've read hundreds maybe even thousands of historical novels. Truth be told, I'm not very picky. I never leave a book unfinished, even if I hate it, I want to have the full picture before I make a final judgement. But, this book was different...I knew within the first chapter that I had a keeper. It's rare to find a book that leaves me thinking about it weeks after finishing it. This book is just that. If you are debating buying it- stop. It's well worth it, and I promise you won't be disappointed."
3,Good story with unlikeable characters,"When I read a romance novel, I like a hero that I would want for myself- Lord Dain is not that hero. He had a difficult childhood and grew into an extremely difficult man- one that our heroine has to work very hard to soften up. She manages, eventually, as normally happens in a romance novel- she also resorts to violence several times, which I saw as a serious anger management problem. These two can have each other. I give this a 3 star rating because the writing was very good and the beginning had a lot of humor, but about halfway through, the humor was gone and the melodrama just went on and on."
2,Does NOT live up to the hype,"From reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I was really looking forward to reading this book, hoping that it really was as good as the reviews claim it to be. To be honest, both the heroine and hero were pathetic and completely annoying. There was no true chemistry and longing, which I believe makes for a good romance! Aside from erotic sex scenes, the story doesn't flow well and was not at all touching. I was so irritated that I wasted my time on reading this book. I read it all the way through, but in the end, there was nothing to redeem it. I have read far better books, like the Prince series from Elizabeth Hoyt, ANY Lisa Kleypas book, or Guilty Pleasures by Laura Lee Guhrke. In fact, I believe that Passion from Lisa Valdez is a truly wonderful romance novel with the hottest sex scenes I've read so far. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book is best borrowed or bought used; it is not worth buying at all!"
4,Moving story with character development,"This is a great wounded hero story. Basically, the main character grew up unloved and unwanted. He is seen as ugly by almost everyone, except the heroine. I love how the hero slowly grows and develops into a happier person because of the love and devotion given to him by the heroine. This is a story that will make you laugh and cry!"
5,Hilarious Beauty and the Beast,"Whatever I can say will be redundant after all the other comments by her reader fans. Dain could melt the South Pole with his smooth Italian phrases. It is also great to read of a hero that doesn't resemble a Greek god. Jessica will always be one of my favorite heroines, strong, great sense of humor and courage to put Dain right where she wants him. Loved this book."
1,A waste,"Jessica was too overbearing and I just couldnt bring myself to like herDain was just too over wrought for words - couldnt get over his own past, abandoned his child, showed no real sense in dealing with anythingAnd then overnight Dain was reformed by the overly capable JessicaAnd what is more the moral of the story seemed to be that women should be tolerant of a man having bastards (the author even quotes examples of some others) but her own character should not have even the hint of being sullied"
5,The BEST of the BEST,"This book is the best of the best, the hero is so touching and real you will fall in love with him. The heroine is everything you could hope for, no more biddable, timid chicks here only a strong, humorous and smart woman who can hold her own.This is without a doubt the very best historical romance I've ever read. I have the same copy that I bought around 7 years ago if not more. I love this book, I only wish there were more like it. But, sorry to say, there are no more of its kind. This book is unique and definately one of a kind. It's a novel that will have you up all night long, you won't be able to put it down for long.Ms. Chase does an excellent job of bringing the book to life and transporting the reader right into every scene."
2,Hmm...wasn't the best,"I bought this book because of the price and trust me, I'm glad I paid no more than a dollar for it. I was barely able to finish it. I'm not a big fan of Loretta Chase as it is, but the book in general was honestly boring. Not my cup of tea, anyway."
5,DA BOMB!,"I loooooved this book. It's da bomb! The relationship between the main characters is complex, funny, sensual and often times ridiculous. Sebastian's childhood shaped him into the man he is but Jessica seems able to look past his verrrry rough edges to see the good and beautiful within him. It's a must have on your bookshelf. READ THIS BOOK."
2,Too hyped up,"I had to check a few times if I was in fact reading the same Lord of Scoundrels referenced by other reviewers here. Whilst I respect that everyone has their own taste I found it surprising how many people thought this book was the best romance they had ever read.I personally could not finish it. The book started out great, the characters had alot of potential and the conversation was very witty - I even laughed out loud a few times. However from the moment they tie the knot it starts going downhill - fast. The hero who is supposed to be a Lord of Sin type, big ruthless and with a heart of stone quickly degenerates into this needy, insecure, characterless character. The heroine who is meant to be strong, comes off more like a know-it all, patronizing smart-ass. And to top it all off the story line was so boring and uneventful that I didn't care what happened to the characters and I stopped reading."
3,The naughty watch! The one-woman duel! Priceless!,"This was a fun read. It was recommended by my new favorite contemporary romance novelist, Ruthie Knox. I don't usually read historical romances. I don't usually appreciate prologues, especially ones that info dump a lifetime's worth of backstory on a main character. But I thoroughly enjoyed the prologue of Dain. Though, I didn't like Dain. He was a little too much for me. A brutish whoremonger that fathered and discarded a 'bastard.' I couldn't get past that while I was reading even though Chase eventually dealt with, and dealt with it in a way that satisfied me. Chase did well with his character arc too, but again, I just saw deadbeat dad and that's never cute. Jess, on the other hand, was a kick-ass heroine! I was reading past midnight to see what she'd do next! Every move she made was unexpected and had me fist-pumping the air...and taking notes! The naughty watch! The one-woman duel! Priceless!"
4,3.5 stars,"Ok, so it started out really good then they get caught in the gardens and it just goes down hill from there for me. I mean i really really liked Dain, even with his flaws and Jess was likeable too but i have to agree with other reviewers, she was perfect! It was annoying! And it was so unbelievable that with her beauty she would still be unmarried at 27, not in those times. I kept thinking Jess should have been a widow. This book had so much potential, the lonely ""ugly"" bad boy hero pretending not to want to be loved but in reality wanting it- i'm a sucker for those and a heroine who was beautiful yet smart and could fight! But in the end, i was disappointed."
4,A Very Good Read,"I had not read Loretta Chase before but I read the good reviews on Amazon and took a chance. I'm glad I did. I really liked this book. It had my favorite type of hero, you know the kind that is tortured by their past and does not think they are deserving of love. The heroine was very original and I loved her personality. I can't believe some of the things she says and does. It was refreshing and a hoot."
5,Great Funny Romance,"I loved this book and I'm an exceptionally picky reader. Jessica has a really endearing personality. She's smart without being unfeeling and innocent without being stupid. And Dain, Lord Beelzebub is such a great character. I find myself re-reading this book when I'm bored without whatever new one I'm reading."
5,Wonderful read!,"This book was excellent from start to finish. I really just didn't want it to end, it would be great to see a second book pick up where this one left off."
5,All-time favourite romance novel,"The main characters are phenomenal, their chemistry is palatable. Dain is your classic bad guy who very, very secretly has a gooey centre. Jessica, the dainty lady with sharp wit and unexpected reactions, is the perfect heroine opposite him. Chase is an accomplished writer, and this is clear from the first chapter. I love this book, love, love, love this book. I cannot rave about it enough, actually. You won't be disappointed."
3,Meh,"I bought this book based on the outstanding reviews and five star ratings it was getting. I have to say considering the hype I was a little dissappointed. Lord of Scoundrels isnt a bad book, I didnt hate, I didnt love it. It was okay.I found it kinda boring at times and the two main characters irritated me somewhat. They were so predictible.I don't know, the plot seemed to drag for me. There was a lot of drama, like when Jessica shot Lord Dane but I didnt feel the sexual tension and simmering build up. It was readable but not a historical romance stand out.I came in with REALLY high expectations and was dissappointed.That said, I am very much in a minority with this book, so people should probably get it out and judge it for themselves."
3,Slow,"For the most part I enjoyed reading this book. I especially loved the dynamic between Jess and Dain. There was several annoyances I could have done without though -- Phelps's dialog (pace killer), copious amounts of info dumps and descriptions (Another pace killer. Less ramble and repetition please), and author intrusion -- to name a few. That said, when Jess and Dain shared a scene together, I had a lot of fun. But I am so glad I'm done with this book... it took me forever to read!"
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book so much I immediately purchased others by the author. Her writing style was very sharp, very smart, which is a breath of fresh air. The characters were likeable, even when they weren't being so, and their attraction to each other absolutely believable and not seeming to have been thrown together because the author wished it so. The story was very well written, I was riveted straight through. I cannot recommend it enough!"
5,Hard to put down!,"This was an amazinly well written story. I laughed, and cried, and definitively enjoyed myself reading it. I have read other Loretta Chase's novels, but this one is my favorite. A very compelling hero, harsh and brutish and Heathcliff-like, I just loved him instantly. And the heroine has a very compelling personality, not a silly blonde that one. I would certainly recommend this novel to any historical romance afficionados."
4,Lord of Scoundrels...Wickedly Villainous Passion!,"Lord Dain is the infamous, diabolical bad-boy...he is the devil himself. His hard-core, unemotional persona has many petrified of him. But all will change when the Lady Jessica enters into his life. There will be that explosive, sizzling hot passion that will have you breathless throughout this fiction! Likewise, Jessica and Dain's constant heated banters and verbal fights are just so sexually arousing; it stimulates the reader to turn the pages that much faster just to see what happens next. This is truly an awe-inspiring, erogenous joining between both characters...amazing adventure just getting to their adoring unity and compassionate happily-ever-after! Brilliant narrative and well-written 19th century historical romance...captivated me throughout the entire novel. Highly recommend!"
2,"Sorry, can't even finish it","This book started off so well, Dain's childhood was written in a funny and touching way. Once he meets Jessica it goes downhill. She is a 27 year old lady and virgin (of course) who suddenly feels instant lust for this man. He is not used to ""ladies"" and falls instantly for her because she is a lady and beautiful, (of course).It all seemed too pat, I felt very little connection between them, and the storyline just became silly. I have only gotten through it halfway, I have not finished it, and started reading another book instead as I lost any interest in what became of the two."
4,Beauty and the Beast,"I like that take that the ""lord"" of this story isn't your typical rake of the ton or so handsome that he made women swoon. Or better yet that maybe he was handsome but he didn't realize it. I like that we see the characters from two different angles: their own self image as well as how they view each other. The attraction between the characters is both believable and steamy and Chase doesn't leave out the relationship development ( which I find is something many romance writer's skip over). I'd definitely recommend this read."
5,A great read,"This is one of those books that is funny and sexy, but still somehow avoids being overdramatic. The characters compliment one another wonderfully. It was a beautiful storry."
5,"My sister thinks the word ""offspring"" at the top of the mousepad is funny.","Oh it's pretty swanky. My mouse is living in luxury. (The mousepad costs more than the mouse!) Use caution if you want to connect multiple input devices (such as mouse, keyboard, joystick/game controller) in the hub since I have noticed annoying interference. This probably comes from ANY USB hub, but I just felt the need to share that tid bit. The glow warms me up inside..."
1,Great series/Poor quality DVD,Previous reviewers already commented on the series. I really liked the show and that is why I purchased the DVDs and most of those interested in buying this set are probably familar with the show. My rating of one star is a reflection of the picture quality. I have not seen any other set as poor as this. Even remastered 60's and 70's shows are not this grainy. If you have an HDTV this will really be noticable. Even on my 21 inch Sony that I have in my bedroom I can notice the poor quality. At the price they are charging you would think they can do something to improve this. It is hard to believe that shows like Dallas and even Gilligan's Island have extremely superior picture quality.
4,Suggestion,"To be the best for me, the dvd should have caption in English. The purchase arrived at my address on time it was expected."
2,2nd Season,I was very disappointed when I got the set and gave it to my daughter-in-law. As with the 3rd season it was missing some episodes. She was disappointed and now I can't find those too season's with all the episodes.
5,Season 2 ... and counting,"I am SO happy CBS decided to release this on DVD; it's my favorite TV show of all time. I am anxiously awaiting all 9 seasons so I can have my daily dose of TBAA with my choice of episodes. If there were more quality programming like this on TV, I might turn it on occasionally."
1,Poor Customer Service,Somehow a duplicate of this item was shipped to me. The contact number of the seller does not work. The website listed is not up and running. I have become extremely frustrated trying to contact someone about this product.
2,Approach with caution,"This is for the Blackthorne Press edition of the Complete Short Stories, by D. H. Lawrence.While I think this volume is a wonderful idea and highly recommend anything by D. H. Lawrence, I feel I should give some warning. While flipping through it, I found numerous type-setting errors, especially on pages 420 about halfway down, 422, and 423. Even the table of contents is poorly aligned. There are many more errors like this; these are just the ones I noticed first. The errors do not make it unreadable, but some may find them annoying."
2,Longwinded,"I agree with the previous two reviews. This book is long winded and puts you to sleep. I cannot even sustain reading a paragraph without either 1)falling asleep, 2)losing concentration 3)more confusedThe author obviously knows what he is talking about but the way he has published his thoughts does not make for easy reading. Garbage in garbage out. Needs some serious editing.I am also reading ""Remote Access Networks: PSTN, ISDN, ADSL,Internet and Wireless"" (McGraw-Hill Computer Communications Series) by Chander Dhawan and I am enjoying this book by far."
1,Too long winded. Not enough practical information.,"I had purchased this book hoping it would help me to run my ISP business, perhaps providing me with some advice and pointers. Instead, I received a long-winded book which spends more time covering the basics of how the Internet works, it's history, and tons of other garbage that I already knew. This book should have been titled ""The Internet, it's history, it's protocols, and a few things to keep in mind if you want to be BORED with the Internet."""
3,life hammer,"The product is definitely a good idea, but we can't seem to find the best place in our car for it.We'll keep working on it. Good product."
1,Useless,"I ordered a bunch of these to control whitefly. The whiteflies land on the traps, but the sticky material is so weak that they struggle for a while and then fly off...very disappointing. Use the Seabright brand...they really do work."
3,Ok but won't cure the problem,"The strips get covered with stuck on bugs, but unfortunately didn't prevent infestation of my flowers. Also caught a few butterflies :("
3,Beatrix,"I purchased this book for my new granddaughter, Beatrix. As I was reading it (my first time through) to her big sister, (age three)I had to edit-on-the-spot. There is some information that would be upsetting to the young set and too much emphasis is put on the fact that Beatrix's parents spent most of their time tending to their own affairs and not to their children. This was confusing to three year old Lucy. What are the 'affairs' of Lucy's mommy and daddy? Didn't they like her? Did they go away?The illustration on the cover is a good match for the content because it portrays a sad, lonely little girl. Though this may be a true rendering of Beatrix Potter's life,it does not make for good reading material for young children.Lovely illustrations throughout."
4,Nice for the price,"Yes, they're a tad small and I'm not sure exactly what kind of stone most are but it's easy enough to figure out which is for what chakra."
3,Great book but missing one very important thing?!?!?!?,This is a great learning tool for the beginning transcriptionist. It is easy to read and flows well. I am very excited about the learning opportunity it provides. There is only one very large problem. You need the CD-ROM that should come with the book. This version does not include the CR-ROM. The ISBN # for the same book with the CD included is 0 13 018735 6 and you will have to special order it from Amazon. If you don't you will have to order the CD seperately. That is if you can find it (I tried with no luck) and it is not cheap. The book with the CD included is much more cost effective. I hope this information helps.
4,funny and sweet,"Despite its potentially inflammatory title, Chicks 101 is a sweet and funny romantic comedy that offers a positive message about love and perception. Giving humorous insight into both how men and women see relationships, the witty script and great performance of lead actor R. Keith Harris will leave you smiling. It has some good natured humor which delivers some good laughs, and a storyline that doesn't leave you feeling cheated."
3,Warm-hearted romantic comedy,"I really enjoyed Keith's performance in Chicks101, as a womanizing cad who finds redemption. This is an easy-going, gentle comedy with a lot of depth. It will challenge your cynicism."
3,Chicks 101,"Aptly directed, with fine performances by Kate Leahey, Keith Harris and Brandon Roberts. The premise loses a bit of steam during the second act, but finishes strongly, both thematically and emotionally."
5,great bread simple preparation,"I love this book and my Breadman ultra. I have made multigrain, french, wholewheat and an italian herb breads that have all turned out great, yummy and healthy. I'm diabetic so I have craft the carbs in my meals and this book seriously helps me do that.I gave a copy of the book to a friend who's son is diabetic and they are enjoyng the bread as well as making it."
2,Hard to find ingredients,I have searched for the ingredients in this book with little success. Carob powder is proving more elusive than I thought it would be. I live in a small town and don't have access to a health food store. It's a little frustrating to have all these possibilities and not be able to use them.
2,Manual is all you need,"This cookbook is not that great and it is very outdated. If you bought a Breadman breadmaker, the manual that came with it is all you need. Nothing in this book compares with the recipes that are in the manual. It also predates the extras compartment and the 2# size loaf. Not worth it in my opinion. If you don't have the manual, Better Homes and Garden's The Complete Guide to Bread Machine Baking is a great one to pick up, and all the recipes have worked in my Breadman without any adjusting."
4,Great for vegans,This is not a vegan bread book but all of the recipes can be made vegan. (It has milk powder in every recipe and honey in most) I just use non-animal milks and maple syrup or agave instead. I also omit the soy lecithin and it comes out just fine. Try the jalapeno tofu cheese corn bread! Its yummy
2,Not all that Healthy,"Most recipes include whey and/or gluten, neither of which is particularly healthy in their refined state.I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that half of the pages in the book could be eliminated by listing the ingredients for both one and one and a half pound loaves on the same page."
1,Remember Who You Are The Awakening,This book is used to mislead people and to be mislead by the author. sometimes people in power misuse their power. some people claim to be spiritual and misuse their role to hurt others. Be careful of hypotherapist when it is used for the wrong purpose
5,"Cherokee Proud - Tony Mack MCCLURE, Ph.D. Book Review","I just rec'd the this book and after only flipping through just a few pages on my great grandmother's MCCLURE lines, I'm impressed! Not only am I looking forward to reading this book but I plan on using it for future reference, as I see a few made at the end of one of the chapters and I haven't even read thru it yet - and can not wait! Thank you Dr. Tony MCCLURE. You did your homework because you know your homework. Buy this book! You will not be disappointed!"
4,"Cherokee Proud: A Guide For Tracing and Honorng Your Cherokee Ancestors, Seconnd Edition","I have not had a chance to implement the different archives reference in the book foe my ancestral research. But, from what I have rea there appears to be plenty of resources mentioned in the book."
4,"Intriguing, pleasant read","Enjoyed reading it quite a bit after I received my copy. Should make a good movie, with enough romance, suspense, and action to catch and hold interest."
3,Forgot it already,"This is a totally unremarkable low-budget movie. It has 17-and-up actors portraying 14-16 year olds, the main females of which get pregnant. Competent acting but hardly memorable. First-time directing by Kerri Green (the major girl in ""Lucas""), so there is nothing special here. The music was OK, maybe even better than other music-heavy movies, though I'd never choose to listen to any of it. I'm giving it a generous three for effort. It might have been more meaningful to me if I was A) female, or b) pregnant.Incidentally, I've had more than 400 DVD's and this was the first with no security strip on the package - something to think about.No DVD extras whatsover, making it a bit over-priced."
3,Bellyfruit is fresh!,"Inspired by real-life stories of teen mothers living in urban Los Angeles, Bellyfruit is a fast-paced trilogy that explores how love and desperation can come together and explode in the anguish of broken dreams and ruined lives With a hip-hop, R&B, funk and techno-rave soundtrack, Bellyfruit is a strikingly honest, unexpected ride through today's US youth culture."
2,try something different,"a simple little book that neither adds nor detracts anything from the zen ""canon."" i found myself suffering through an accute sense of deja-vu as i read allen's book. nothing in this book hasn't been said or done before in other ""zen for everyday man"" or ""zen for westners"" type books. unfortunately, allen's book falls into the very dualism that he claims to reject from ""disfunctional"" western thought (i.e. zen thought good, western thought bad). occational attacks and pokes at the west quickly become part of this book's landscape. sadly, by the end of the book the only thing that stands out are the pictures. i would suggest exploring other books on the topic of zen that are less concerned with superflous judgements & dull ancedotes."
2,Disappointing overall,"I saw the ""Mystic Massuer"" recently. As a Trinidadian I eagerly looked forward to seeing a cinematographic presentation of a work by one of our finest writers. I was sorely disappointed. The acting fell far below what I'd expected - with the actors seeming to merely go through the motions. The story dragged and lacked development (what about Ganesh's wife not being able to have a baby!!) and, after all that, the film ended too abruptly. Costuming was unreal, historical facts were distorted (steelpan music on the radio!!), and accents seemed to come and go. I look forward to seeing a cinema showing this part of the world using Caribbean actors. Please do something about making the story move - just because pundit meanders through his life, doesn't mean I want to feel like I'm spending a lifetime meandering through this film. The best thing I can say is: Thanks for paying tribute to writer V. S. Naipaul. Had some nice scenery."
3,The Buffy Cross,"The cross is modeled right after the famous cross that Buffy wore in season 1, and 2.The product it self isn't meant to be an official symbolic object of the lord, hence, on the back of the cross we have a ""FOX 2005 TM"" trademark. However, any buffy fan will be very glad to own this. This 2 inch, silver, cross is very gender neutralized, as in, a male or female could easily wear it without worrying if it's ""famine"" or ""masculine,"" however, the 18 inch necklace itself is very famine looking. I myself am a 6'0 male, and the necklace was to short to wear with comfort, so I ended up using a different chain.The velvet box is very tasteful, and does have the buffy logo right on top. It's just like any other box a normal ring, ear rings, etc, would come in. The inside is no different."
5,TV-Merch is a great way to get a the things you want in a great way.,"TvMerch is a fast and awesome way to get what you want, you will get the package way quicker than expected!"
4,Great headgear. Doesn't slip.,"This is really nice headgear. It doesn't slip, and is comfortable to wear.My cauliflower ear problems are a thing of the past!That said, there is one design flaw on this product. The Velcro straps on the top of the headgear tend to scratch up my partners up during free-training.Other then that, this thing rocks!"
4,"Good, but chafes a lot","The headgear is really comfortable to wear for about two weeks, after which the foam padding starts to crack. The padding on the chinstrap cracked a lot, causing chafing and cuts on my chin. I solved it using athletic tape, but I would have hoped it would be more durable. On the other hand, it never slides, never comes undone during a match, and is surprisingly comfortable if you count out the chafing."
4,"Headgear, Great! Velcro, could be better...","I really really like this headgear. My favorite thing about them is I can finally hear what my coach is saying while in a match, it's incredible. I can hear what other people are saying, even at a distance. This is important because our school has to practice with our headgear on (kinda sucks, I know...). The only thing I do not like about this headgear, however, is the velcro. The velcro is so weak that the headgear tries to come off almost every time I wrestle. This key is try to keep the velcro dry I guess. Everythings cool besides that."
5,Headgear,Item was exactly as described and delivered super fast - just in time for my son's wrestling camp. He loves it.
4,Pretty sound piece of gear.....,"It was awkward at first, but once you get the right fit, it works great. I have never had it fall off or even slip over my ears. I fight professionally in MMA and my ears are pretty banged up. Tuck in your pride and save your ears with this."
5,Comfortable and works great,This headgear is the best one I've tried so far. It's comfortable even to wear for all of practice as well as matches.
4,Great Buy!,"My son has been in wrestling for 4 years now and it's VERY important that they be able to hear what a coach is shouting to them when they are in the middle of a match. We started him out with a very basic pair of ASICS headgear (when he was 4) but purchased the Cliff Keen for this year and he loves them. Very comfortable. He can hear better. And they're still lightweight. More importantly, I have never seen a pair of this headgear get pulled off like you see other brands. How frustrating is that? To be in the middle of your match and your headgear slip down over your eyes! I didn't give it 5 stars because we also purchased an additional pair for our upcoming 5 year old son and there's a sharper patch of plastic (like it got melted and cooled wrong). It doesn't seem to bother him but it's right on his cheek. Anyway, they both love them."
4,Works well,"Looks good and colors are true to picture but they ""pop"" more. Son likes them and enjoys the comfort and I love the safety it supplies to my son during matches."
3,"Good headgear, but they sent me the wrong color.","the headgear really gets the job done, if anything, it just beats up anyone not wearing gear. the problem is that it just came yesterday. i ordered the black/white/black and they sent me the transparent/black/black, definetly not what i ordered. one star off for the service, the season is already started, so because i have to send these back, another star off"
1,Junk. Fell apart before I could even use it.,"I owned this jumpstarter for about a year now. It has been in the box unused since I purchased it. I went to re-charge it in the event I would need it and discovered that the black squeeze handle that connects to the battery had cracked into two pieces, where the spring connects to the handle and it is totally useless now. I've contacted the manufacturer and they ignore my emails. I would stay away from this product and this brand. If you google them you will see that they sell these to retailers for so cheap then they turn around and re-sell them to us, the consumer for 4 to 5 times what they buy them for. They are of poor quality and will not last. Research and find a better brand but stay away from this poorly made Canadian product with POOR customer service support."
3,Silicone oil brush and decanter,"I really wanted to like this product and overall it does what it's supposed to; however, if you don't have a need to brush oil a lot, it's more work than it's worth. After you brush your food with the silicone brush (which is so much nicer than the old bristle type), you dip it back into the oil reservoir. You end up carrying particles of your food back into the reservoir and essentially contaminating the oil there. The brush doesn't touch the bottom of the jar also and it's a challenge to get the brush into the oil if there's only a small amount of oil left in the jar. I've found it useful when brushing a large amount of food, but don't use it much unless I'm working with bigger quanities of food. It's more work than it's worth for small amounts, and if you don't use it regularly, the oil will go stale. I'm keeping it, but it has limited functionality for me."
4,life,I think this film gives a realistic view of what a parent encounters in dealing with teenage desires and emotions
2,Disappointing Eroticism,"To be brief, this movie is too dull. Sadly, Maude Adams is, also, not exposed, which was a significant motivator for the purchase."
1,Laura is Lost,"Upon reading other reviews I was surprised, did they see the same movie as I? This David Hamilton movie has NO plot whatsoever and NO dialogue. I like ""artsy"" movies, and those coming of age romps with attractive young women, yet this movie farce was the worst example of both. Instead of ascetic beauty, one gets contrived nonsensical boredom. The ""lolita"" of the movie is average at best, and more of an after thought to plot design, or more aptly lack there of. I highly recommend you pass on this one, I wish I had!"
2,Laura,"Slow, out of focus, I say out of focus because it was beyond soft focus. The story was just way too slow."
1,CD jacket had me drooling.......,"I cant believe how bad this was!Yes the main character Dawn Dunlap was pretty cute and it showed her briefly nude,but her acting was so horribly,bad she seemed slow and retarded.That jerk David Hamilton had the opportunity to make a really erotic movie with this cute girl but he blew it by trying to make an art film.What he did was end her acting career(maybe he did her a favor).The story was so moronic it was unwatchable.The actor who seduces her looked like such a fag ,it made me want to go out and gaybash......(and I did)I've seen episodes of Baywatch that were better!"
2,Laura in fog.,"""Laura"" has a decent story that could have been developed but wasn't; the over use of soft focus distracted from the story there was. The DVD is of moderate VHS quality video; I don't know if this is poor quality transfer or poor photography but is also bad enough to be distracting. It was like the old days of a drive in movie and the first movie was good enough that you wish it had been dark enough to have seen it; when you finish watching this movie you feel like you should have seen something good but didn't."
1,What a crashing bore,"A smattering of nudity here and there does not rescue the viewer from abject tedium. Some people seem to think that any film with very little dialog and a dreamy look is ""artistic"" and therefore has value. Never mind that the leads cannot act and the plot is as thin as the gauze that must have been placed over the lens. The director is best known as a still photographer; little wonder that the images on the screen might as well be still photography for all the content they have. I am 100 percent regretful I wasted my money on this turkey."
2,Decent...,"In my opinion, this book was kind of stupid. The mysterious teacher in the book is kind of on the verge of stalking. The main female character is kind of annoying, as she cannot decide what she wants and stick with it. The book is unbalanced and seems to move way too quickly. I would recommend not buying this book."
3,Just a corny love story,"This love story is sort of trite. I know a couple of really cases in which a student fell in love with her teacher. Nevertheless you can read it but don't expect a blockbuster book. If you really want to read a paramount love story read: ""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks."
2,NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES!,I HAD WISHED TO FIND MAYBE LESS OF AN AGE GAP. PURELY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AT THE AGE OF 16. IF SHELLEY HAD BEEN 18 I THINK THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE BELIEVABLE. TWO YEARS CAN DO A LOT IN THE MATURITY DEPARTMENT.IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE SHE IS STILL INFATUATED WITH HER OLD HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. THE ONLY REASON I BELIEVED THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER IS BECAUSE HE HAD TRIED TO CONTACT HER A FEW YEAR LATER. MAKING SURE SHE WAS DOING OKAY AND WAS HAPPY.OVERALL THE BOOK JUST MADE ME FEEL DISGUSTED ABOUT THE SITUATION. TEACHERS GET IN BIG TROUBLE ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF AND NOW PEOPLE ARE WRITING STORIES ABOUT IT. I THINK THIS COULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF SANDRA BROWNS COLLECTION OF BOOKS.
4,A breathtaking love story,This is a story about a school girl who is infatuated by her teacher cherishes the memory of a stolen kiss with her charming teacher. Turning into a lady and a broken marriage destiny brings her back to her first crush. From then on the script is completely breathtaking and real with regards to the feelings of sin mixed with extreme passion between the inseparable couple. A Must Read for those who enjoy romantic fiction!
1,A Kiss to Forget,"I normally love Sandra Brown's books. This one had so little story and so much bedroom that I am glad that I paid 25 cents for it at half-price books (in a bunch of 4 for a dollar). It is still in the stands at stores, and I was sorely tempted, but \I would really have been sorely disappointed."
2,Another one that should have stayed in the archives,"Shelley is a divorcee who has recently returned to college to finish the degree she abandoned just before getting married. Her professor is none other than Grant Chapman, the high school teacher with whom she shared a tantalizing kiss 10 years earlier when he taught civics.Grant left school immediately following that illicit afternoon kiss, and took a job as a congressional aide. He leaves that job due to another potential scandal. He is once again attracted to Shelley, and since she is no longer underage (thus off limits), he asks her out. In order to find happiness the two must overcome many obstacles including former lovers and a dean that is suspicious of Grant's motivations.The story is dated, the conflict nearly non-existent, and the dialog a little trite at times. Recommended reading only for anyone who had a crush on a teacher."
1,Please Don't,"I bought this audio book to keep me company on a long car ride. After about an hour of the same nonsense over and over again I threw it out at the rest stop. I threw it out just in case I got so deperate on my journey that I'd put it back in.This book is a disservice to the readers. It would do no good for me to describe it. Plotless, stupid, repetitive, and an insult to readers. It should be recalled."
2,Not a great read,I bought this on Audio CD and it was just too predictable. Very short and a little sappy. Not one of my favorites for sure
2,Lacked everything you normally get with a Sandra Brown novel,"I wanted to give this book a chance, even though I knew she had written it years ago, but I just could not finish this book. I didn't like the plot, I didn't even like the characters. Blah. I can recommend, however, a spine-tingling lovefest in The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. Not one to miss."
2,Cute story,I prefer her stronger older characters. I suggest the book envy and the others like it. Sandra Brown is a greatwriter
2,A Kiss Remembered,I was so disappointed in this book. It was definitely not up to Sandra Brown standards. I have been reading her books for years and have loved all of them.
2,Q Kiss Remambered,It was a typical love story.There was nothing that really kept your interest. It was just ok. I think There was just enough to make you want to read it. There should have been a little more I would never had paid to read this. I am not sure I won't go back to regular books . I think the way we look at real books you can determine much more and decide whether to buy it or not.
4,Loved it!!!,"This is one of my favorite books of all time! I have the paper back edition and when I got my kindle, it was one of the first books I downloaded. It's definitely one of Sandra Brown's best. I've recommended it to several friends and not one of them was disappointed in it."
2,Was expecting something much better,"I was unfamiliar with Sandra Brown but was encouraged to see that she is a number one bestselling author. However, I found this book fairly bland and boring. As others have pointed out, it's rather dated, but I didn't mind that. What I minded was the repetitiveness, for one thing. It seemed like there were endless scenes that were basically the same thing over and over. We can't be together! But we must! But we can't! Passionate lovemaking, rather Harlequin romance-esque, followed by the main character, Shelley, running away and vowing never to see her love again.I won't give away the ending, but I'll just say that to me, it lacked any interesting plot development or anything that could really get me involved in the story."
2,Very VERY average,"It wasn't the sort of spine-tingling romance you would expect from Sandra Brown. It wasnt completely hopeless though, I just felt that the relationship was a bit rushed."
1,A Kiss remembered,"What were they thinking to reissue this book? And in hardcover and audio. A Kiss remembered is not just extremely dated it is extremely silly.There must be many wonderful new authors with wonderful books waiting to be printed but the publishers here have chosen to use Sandra Brown's name to trick readers into buying a book that is a grand disappointment. Do they think we can't tell the difference between a good book and a dud? Well, people who paid money to buy this are not likely to take a chance again."
2,Sexual Predator + Desperate Girl = Classic Love Story?,"This story had so much potential. I was hooked on this book from the blurb and had such high hopes for it only to be disappointed. I know that professor/student affairs go on, but I can't imagine them being as creepy as the relationship described in this book. The guy needed to be doused with some pepper spray on several occasions and the girl needed to grow a backbone and stick up for herself when she did not desire his sexual advances. The whole thing was not what I would call romantic, just strange. The entire book was strange. NOT one of Sandra Brown's best pieces."
1,Don't waste your time,"I almost finished this book. I kept reading because I simply couldn't believe that this apparently very prolific author had managed to write an entire book based on nothing. This is my first and last book by Sandra Brown. There are too many wonderful books that deserve our attention to waste time with a book this puerile that has nothing redeeming in it. I'm assuming this is not an aberration, but a continuation of Sandra Brown's ""style."""
3,Not great but not bad,"I enjoyed the audio of this book. It's not the best story I've ever read/heard but it's not the worst. You do wonder that Grant continues to pursue Shelly after her protests but since she's so ambivalent even while rejecting him, he doesn't seem to be a stalker for continuing. Overall, I enjoyed it.As for the accents, voices, etc., I've learned to ignore that while listening to an audio book--no one has gotten every regional accent right on any audio I've had, so I just suspend disbelief and listen for the story, not the performance."
4,Great weekend read!!!!,"This is a typical love story by Sandra Brown. It is fast-paced, filled with juicy love scences, and with characters that make us feel. I love reading Ms. Brown, she has the ability to take the reader away from everyday life and bring us a world filled with happily ever afters. What more can a avid romance reader ask for? This is a great starter for those just getting into this genre. Enjoy...I sure did."
5,I loved this story.,"I just finished this book and I loved it. Sometimes in love there is turmoil and struggle. If you want a book where boy and girl meet and go skipping blissfully down the rosy path, this may not be right for you. If you like a story where there is human emotions and the ups and downs that come with being in love, this is a good read."
1,For Gosh Sakes!,"I've been listening to this book on playaway at work and I found it unbearable. All of the tempting of each other, the advance and retreat, leading to eventual climax ~ I kept wanting to say 'For gosh sakes! DO IT, already!'This book reminded me of a 'Modern Romance' magazine story, something I would only read willingly if I were marooned on an island with no other reading material available.There was no plot other than the interplay between the ridiculous wordy Shelley and Grant. I couldn't see anything for them to overcome.When the book spoke of his 'pulsating manhood' or her 'quivering femininity,' I must confess I laughed out loud at work."
1,"Farthest thing from a ""classic love story""","I totaly agree with previous reviewer. Not enough plot, too many unrealistic bedroom scenes, poor dialog. I also found the male character ignoring the female saying NO troubling too. Not a good way to portray this type of situation at all.This is the first book I've read by Sandra Brown and I am not impressed. I have no idea why a publishing company would re-release this 20 year old story. It is a waste of time and money as far as I'm concerned."
2,A dated Harlequin romance re released in a hard cover,"I would be so embarrassed to release this old book in hardcover if I were Sandra Brown. Originally published about 20 years ago the author states that this story reflects the ""trends and attitudes"" that were popular at that time. (Read-dated!) I've never read any other Sandra Brown books and am not likely to now. I wonder why this supposedly successful author of numerous novels would re-release something this dated and simplistic? It certainly isn't worth the ...cover price. Check it out at the library if you are a huge Sandra Brown fan. If you're not, don't even bother with it."
1,BAD CONNECTION,"I DONT THINK I SHOULD EVEN DO A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK, BUT I WOULD LIKE OTHER READERS TO KNOW HOW I FELT ABOUT THIS BOOK. I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT THIS BOOK EVEN GOT PUBLISHED. I THOUGHT TEACHERS GOT INTO BIG TROUBLE FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF, BUT TO MAKE A LOVE STORY ABOUT IT WAS VERY WRONG. IT MAKES IT SOUND OKAY FOR A TEACHER TO KISS ONE OF HIS STUDENTS AND THEN TO TURN IT AROUND AND HAVE THEM FALL IN LOVE, I JUST DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT. I REALLY LIKE SANDRA BROWN'S WORK BUT I THINK SHE COULD HAVE KEPT THIS OUT OF HER COLLECTION."
3,Superlatively Bad,"If this was just regular bad writing, I'd give it fewer stars. But, I think it takes an exceptional author to produce a novel where almost every single sentence is a cliche. I was actually kind of blown away by SB's ability to do that, line after line, chapter after chapter. And they all rolled together so smoothly. I was torn between feeling ill due to the cheesey plot and the insipid characters, and complete awe at the ability of the author to roll out cliche after cliche, so smoothly and coherently.I found the idea of Grant loving Shelly, since she was in high school and he was a teacher, to be disturbing. Ewwww.The teacher/student romance at the undergraduate level is not OK at any institution that I know of. More ewwwww.Her career goal is dated, but that would be OK if the rest of the book weren't so awful. Shelly is a drip in any time period.To every other negative assessment to date, I'd say ""ditto""."
2,Not that Great and Dated,"I bought this book despite people saying it was very dated. If nothing else, I love historic romances, so I figured it would not matter. In the end, the story was not that great, the sex was not that hot, and the book was so dated (I assume written in the 70s or possibly 80s) that it really distracts from the story."
5,a kiss remembered,The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. Sandra Brown is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
2,"Visual paradise, limbo plot.","If a man is impotent, the Kama Sutra is the answer. This is the main theme for this film about what the Kama Sutra means. The art of love Kama Sutra that suggests in the theme is not the concept presented in this video. A man with impotence may be the cause of many reasons, hormonal, physical, psychological, or deviant. The Kama Sutra techniques are not the answer to these problems, as it implies in this film. Moreover, the madam of the mansion or sanctuary, looks as a priestess, owner of the lives of the maidens she maintains below her domains. The couple in this ""tale"" does not have the chemistry of lovers; they act like robots in the entire story. In the other side, the photography is a work of art in the film. The only excellent characterization is the Indian maiden. This girl is exceptionally beautiful; she captures the interest of the viewer. The plot is obscure, bored, slow and tiresome."
2,Do your self a favour buy behind the paint,This offers the commited Juggalo no real insight into ICP it is a mish mash of stuff and snippets gleaned from the definative book behind the paint by Violent J.Do yourself a favour dont get mugged read up on ICP on their website or another fansite and buy the proper book this is nothing new and definatley not fantastic but dull and pedestrian.
2,Not up to snuff,"This was not Diane's usual quality. The story lacked the technical details, the plot support within the star trek universe, and most of all - gave little or no information on the alien bad-guys. I really was left empty on this one. Sorry Diane."
2,Extremly boring.,I found Intellivore to be one of the worst Star Trek books I have ever read. It went way to slowly. I skipped half the book and I still knew what was going on. I'm sorry but that's my opinion
2,"Good ideas, bad writing","This book was both good and bad. It was good because it was sort of a new idea and it was very creatively written. I had the hardest time reading it though, it was incredibly ""wordy"" and the book just didn't seem to ""flow."""
5,The cat who got me addicted,"This book is my favorite. Not only is the title humorous, but I really like it the story the best. Maybe it's because Yum Yum is introduced, and the family becomes complete, or maybe it's just all of the crazy people that Qwill meets before he moves to Moose County, but this is the book that I can read over and over and still have it be just as good as the first time."
4,Guidall's reading saves this one,"I like mysteries and am always on the lookout for a new series. I had read the ""Brahms"" entry in this series but I didn't remember much about it, so when I saw this in the library I picked it up with mild interest. The mystery itself is more of the ""cozy"" type where people get killed ""offscreen"" so to speak. And this is at best an average example of that type. What really saves this one is the acting skill of George Guidall, who is fast becoming one of my favorite readers (along with Michael Prichard). His subtleties really bring out the best aspects of this book, which are the characterizations. Qwilleran really comes alive here.If you are a fan of Braun or Guidall, or like hearing about talented cats, I would recommend picking this one up. But from just the mystery standpoint, you could give this one a miss."
4,For Cat Lovers,"The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern is Fun reading, especially for cat lovers! I thought the plot and characters were well developed for a short novel."
5,Koko the Siamese Cat,Koko the Siamese Cat uses Jim Qwilleran to solve the mysteries of the crimes of a local gang who are really quite inept and should be rounded up by the cops in no time in spite of Jim Qwillerans interferance
2,The Cat Who Ate Modern Danish,"For more than 20 years I have LOVED Lilian Jackson Braun's "" Cat "" books, but never had gotten to read the very first book...This one !! It is fun and if you haven't read any of the others, is a great introduction to KoKo, Yum yum and Quill, a great newspaperman with a sensitive moustache."
5,Great reading,"This is a great book! I love how ""The Cat Who.."" books keep you guessing. I could not put this book down. I read this book and the ""The Cat Who Turned On and Off"" in 3 days. They were so good!"
2,"no good for bent knee sports, aka brazilian jiujitsu","Yes, the brace offers very good protection for the knee--as long as your leg is pretty straight. But if you're doing brazilian jiujitsu where you're on your knees a lot, the knees bent, they just aren't any good.First of all, the brace puts a lot of pressure on a bent knee--the internal support ""pushes back"" a lot when bent.Then, after using these for a few weeks for jiujitsu, one of them actually split in the back.Another issue I found for jiujitsu is that the brace kept falling off. So on the one hand it was too tight for a bent knee, and on the other, it kept slipping off. I did try a size larger and those came off even quicker.So I have to assume these are more for stand-up wrestlers, or boxers, or baseball players. But for jiu-jitsu, a big ""no.""I do want to commend worldwide sport supply--they are processing my return on these with no problem. Good shop."
5,Excellent product,"I bought this knee brace for my son who was coming off of knee surgery(torn meniscus) He wore these knee pads from November to march, wrestling in 45 matches and daily practices. these pads were excellent in the way they cushioned his knee and protected him from any injury. the only down side was the cloth fabric sleeve's(holder) became worn out late in the season and it was required to be wrapped with tape around the top of the pad so it would stay up. i plan on purchasing another pair before next wrestling season."
4,air knee brace,Great knee brace. I use it while playing baseball and basketball to protect my knees. I does a wonderful job. I can get a little bulky though.
5,"Gorgeous, beautiful collection","""The Road Scholar"" made me interested in fingerstyle guitar. A blazing, melodic, driving piece, it opens the CD with a rush. Much of the album is more restrained, with a focus on melody and tone that makes for a wonderful set. There are some powerful tunes among the contemplative ones--""Miasma"" is a minor key whirlwind, and ""Firefall"" is a fun piece inspired by meteor showers--but his tone and technique are flawless throughout. Mize is a master."
5,"Beautiful music, so calming!","We purchased our first copy of this cd about 8 years ago because we enjoy acoustical guitar. We also used it for our newborn twins to listen to in order to fall asleep. They slept so well, that it became a necessity anywhere we would go overnight! They have listened to it at least once (sometimes set to repeat)every night their entire life. After several years, we needed this second copy because the first was scratched after so much use.Bill Mize is is amazing on the guitar, and it's so calming to listen to. Great background music in the car or for entertaining!"
4,"4 stars , but......","I was given the book as a gift by one of the contributing writers It was good to hear about people that I served with in 3rd Force Recon Co. from Nov.65-Dec.68..... I think that books that are written in this style lack emotion and color, sorry but I have to be honest. Also,concerning the subject( stingray patrols) though I am not a military scholar I did participate for 20 months in both Stingray and Keyhole (4 man team) patrols. We suffered less casualties using the Keyhole approach and still inflicted many casualties on the enemy. I don't share the praise given to this concept of warfare, all it did was waste many good friends of mine. Although I don't care for this sort of effort, it is probably interesting to many other people and I am sure that it is worth the price but not 5 stars..... Sorry but that is how I feel about the book....."
3,Not Impressed,The book is only a revisit of several prior excellent works. It seems to be an analysis of official records.
2,Yawn,"I tried my best to get past the beginning chapters of this book but failed. It was so much dry history all I could do was yawn. I got to the point of skipping chapters and skimming to see if it got any better ... it did not. I may try to get through it again in the future but for now it occupies an obscure corner of my Ipad, collecting dust."
4,"An Enchanting , Mysterious book!","As the second part in an enchanting 3 part mini-series, this book was better then the first! I'm really glad that I bought this book! In haven't got the 3rd book yet, but I'm dyeing to find out what happens! If you but this book, find the 3rd book, and keep reading! I know that you will love this book, and the third book! Happy reading!"
4,Syn-Tech for 788 in 308,"The stock is well made, but is not just a straight bolt in replacement. The action fits well, but the floor plate area around the front action bolt needed some relief which required tools not usually found in your weekend handyman's tool box. Once that was done, the floor plate needed to be shimmed for the action to be tight to the stock."
5,I love this book!,"This book has never let me down. It has every name of every river, mountian or man named in the Bible. I have bought several copies for my pastor friends. They all use this book regularly and are always grateful for the gift."
5,excellent reference book,This edition is concise and conveniently sized for easy portability. Since names in scripture have meaning I find that it enhances my bible study and gives greater insight.
1,Where is all the information?,"This is a skeleton of a Bible names dictionary. It does not give the pronunciations correctly, and absolutely no references at all to where each name can be found in the bible. When will someone come out with a truly useable Bible names dictionary? This is definitely NOT it!"
1,Utter Trash,"Crude, crass, shameful. I'm ebarrassed to say that I read the entire book (because I had to find out how the author was going to redeem the vulgar protagonist and her daughter by the end of the story - which he didn't achieve). A complete waste of time. Ick."
1,A new low in the art of the novel!,"This book has brought me to tears on several occasions, the first of which was the day I bought it for my wife and discovered shortly thereafter that I'd wasted my money. The second, as you might guess, was when my wife _told_ me I'd wasted my money. I tried to read it myself, and convinced myself that we were both right. This book is a tragic waste of trees and time. Do yourself a favor. Leave this at the bookstore. Get a good night's sleep instead."
3,Not quite as good as the show...,"After watching the show on BBC America for months, I decided to give this book a try. The plan seems a bit overwhelming to me. Don't get me wrong, it was great to read why she started on this path and how she got to where she is now, but this is a little bit more involved than I thought it was going to be. The diet itself isn't all that horrible - the detox part is what scares me! But, I guess that's what scares the people on the show as well. I'm just doing it without her help. As long as you can find the ingredients, the diet itself really isn't that bad."
3,Ummm....,"I bought this book because a girlfriend highly recommended it, and frankly I feel there are many other health books that are WAY more beneficial. I was not very impressed and do not feel like I learned anything."
5,Insightful; a real guide book to perfect health,"I love this book. I refer to it whenever I have questions about my health and eating habits. A truly remarkable book about nutrition. Dr. Mckeith really knows what she is talking about. My favorite part is the section ""getting to know your body"" where she talks about different body signs and the reasons and solutions for them. I recommend this book to people who struggle with weight, or people who want to know more about healthy nutrition. it also talks about bad nutrition and how that affects you. great book! 5 stars!..the colorful pages don't hurt too=)."
5,Sheer Genius!,"This is not just a book about food, its also part medical dictionary. Do you know what causes Varicose Veins? Where you get pimples is a signal for different organs that need nourishment! Do you know that your stomach uses more than one kind of digestive acid and how you combine foods is important? Did you know that your tongue showcases nutrient deficiencies? Do you know what coffee really does to your body?If you want to get to know the food you eat and if you want to know about the human body order this book with next day delivery! After one month on the program I no longer take naps, feel exhausted and I lost a lot of fat! I'll have a six pack next month for sure!"
5,Love Dr. Gillian,Greatly informative in a way that other books like it don't go into. My tongue is suddenly much more interesting.
4,advice on healthy eating,"I've been watching Gillian McKeith's show on BBCAmerica and found it fascinating. It's not just about losing weight, but eating better. As she says, you don't have to follow all of her advice to the letter, but if you can follow it 80% of the time you will feel better and have more energy. We have been trying to follow it and I do feel better."
5,Helpful Book!!,I really enjpyed this book and have bought it to share as a gift as well.There are lots of helpful hits- and good reminders about healthy eating and what foods to avoid- and what one definately must add to their diet. I actually started one regime from the book which has helped me out tremendously.Worth it if you are serious about changing your eating habits for the better.
4,Great Read,"I was excited that my book arrived as quickly as it did! And even more impressed with what a great informative book this is! The book arrived in perfect condition, the packaging was appropriate for the item. I am really excited to read it!"
3,You Are What You Eat,"I cautiously recommend this book because of the controversy surrounding its author. The book itself had some very informative and useful tips and I intend to use it as a guideline. I would take what's written in the book with some common sense and be aware that the products recommended personally by the author should be carefully scrutinized before purchasing. I found the information, concerning which foods that are better to eat, to be the most useful."
4,"Change is good, but just a bit bland.","It was good to read the book, but living in Alaska, I find some of the ingredients difficult to find. But the concept is good."
5,"Short but sweet, a Quick guide that proves useful as a start for further nutrition education.","Being written as a task-oriented guide, this makes for a handy book to have around so one can quickly look up symptoms and etc and make changes. The author does not go into great depth about the interactions of food and nutrients but opens the door to further exploration for any topics one finds most curious."
2,Fussy and unrealistic in a pretty package,"While the physical beauty is high in this book- glossy pages, bright colors, and bold fonts- the rest of the book falls flat. The author tricks you by acting and writing about how 'easy' it is to eat clean, but then goes into a thousand different things that are wrong with your feces and your tongue, and all the specialty ingredients that you need to buy to make it better.If you are into hardcore rules to your eating, and weird detox diets, on top of strange eating, then buy this. If you, like most of us, want something that is really going to help you change your lifestyle? Skip this. This book is fussy, and completely unapproachable."
1,Extreme,"I am a fan of her tv show and thought the book would be a good reference to keep on hand. After reading the book and her severe detox methods, I really feel that she is way too extreme!"
1,Impractical,"Talk about complicated! You can't simply go to your local grocers for half the ""foods"" listed, if they can be considered foods like seaweed. Not for the average american. I know the point is to eat healthier, but you have to have great committment to follow this plan, more than the average dieter has. I'm honest to myself and could not complete one day on this diet, and found myself wasting my time finishing the book."
2,Embarrassing and distracting layout,"This book is full of multicolor pages with contrasting text. It is full of slick modern colors of every shade in the rainbow. It hardly seems like a book, designed for an audience that is looking for content and information. I have a hard time looking at it, let alone reading it. This author ought to apply some of her own rules on food combinations to book lay-out. If this author expects this work to be read and understood it should have been done in a traditional manner. This book is too obnoxious and distracting to read. It is offensive to my minds eye. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,Be Healthy!,"I LOVE this book! Even if you follow just some of her suggestions, you'll feel so much better. I was given the book as a gift....I have since purchased 3 for friends. I am hooked!"
5,you are what you eat,"I really enjoyed this book. After watching Gillian's tv show, I couldn't wait to get her books and start being what I eat. Her books are very helpful in determining how to correctly address different issues. One issue it helped me with was about my tongue. I had questioned a doctor about it and she simply said ""that is the way you are."" So to me it just confirmed that you should get an 2nd opinon when possible. So to me if you really want to learn what you are, this is a great book to have."
5,You Are What You Eat,"This book by nutritionist, Dr. Gillian McKeith, is great. It's very informative, easy to read and understand and based on sound judgement and nutrition. I got turned on to Dr. Gillian by her show of the same name on the BBC America channel. I love the show and love the book and I am making steady changes in my diet to conform to Dr. Gillian's regime. I already feel better and have lost 3 pounds."
5,This book is a lifesaver for me! I lost 5 lbs in one week and feel great!,I love watching this show on the BBC! I got the book and feel so much better. I have lost 5 lbs without effort. The advice sometimes feels a little kooky but if you take it all in and use the important principles (like drinking herbal tea instead of soda and trading in nasty takeout food for healthy vegetable based REAL food) you will like this diet.
5,Love the book!!,This book is extremely informative if you are interested in changing the way you eat. It has a great knowledge base and gives you wonderful insight into changing your eating habits. It's a must buy for the educated healthy person!
5,Life changing,"This book has really changed my life. I have been on every diet there is and nothing seemed to work. I started watching Gillian on her tv show and something clicked with me. I got the book and started working hard and following by her tried and true method. So far I have lost 50 pounds and counting and this has been the easiest 'diet', or life change I have ever followed. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble getting started, it will change you too."
4,I guess it's true,"I suppose we are what we eat, and Dr. Gillian isn't gonna let you forget it. Her suggestions may seem a bit ""out there"" for those new to the health food circuit, but as she might say, they are ""spot on!"" The profiles of actual clients are frightening. How many of us would like to actually be confronted with what we put in our mouths on a daily basis! This book is full of great suggestions to help turn your eating habits around. That is if you are prepared to face up! She does a great job of reminding us that unprocessed, whole foods are the only healthy way to go. A very practical manual for health."
5,If you really want to feel better,"I watch Gillian's show often and had to try the diet.You really do feel better. It is difficult getting used tothe lack of salt and dairy, but if you can hold out for a couple of weeksyou will notice you have more energy and feel better. If you stickto it your sugar cravings and binge eating will stop.Some of the items that are in this book are hard to find if youdo not have a health food store close by, but if you are serious aboutgetting better it would be worth ordering them online. All in all, you will actually choose heathier foods and enjoy them after a while and feela lot better."
4,eating well,"as older adults, we are very interested in making available changes in our eating habits in order to extend our current good state of health."
2,Wasn't all I'd hoped for,"I was looking for resources to help me make social studies more meaningful. I thought this book would help me find good book sources to teach history, but instead it was more of sales job on why I should do that."
5,A great book for bedtime.,"It was not easy for me and my husband to send my 3-year-old boy to bed. He always asked for one more song again and again with tears. This bothered us so much. My husband bought this book for him and we read together before his bedtime. After several days, it did work! My boy went to bed without crying and arguing. I thought he got something from this book. The bedtime is no longer ""bad time"" for us."
4,one of the best anthologies available,"This is one of the two best anthologies of literary theory available (the other is the fourth edition of RC DAvis and R. Schleiffer, Literary Criticism (Longmans).. Rivkin and Ryan's have a comprehensivce and judicious set of selections, covering all the key areas of contemporary theory, and provide useful introductoiry material."
1,Wrong Edition Shipped,"Seller seemed to be fast and efficient in their shipping of the item, but upon receiving the book I found it was the wrong edition. I received the original edition, rather than the second, which was what had been advertised. Now I am past the return date, and highly upset. Do not use this seller."
3,recipe book collection,I feel the book was great in it's content butthe cover could have been better protected fromspiol etc. it only had a thin coating of wax orsomething. I was expecting a coating of plastic.thanks for this review.
5,The perfect Bridal Shower Gift,"Family Recipe Collection BookI am hosting a bridal shower and decided that since the couple had most everything they needed, that a recipe shower would be the perfect way to honor the Bride and connect the families and friends of the couple. Share a favorite recipe, include a gift that relates to the recipe and present them in the Family Recipe Collection Book. It's beautiful and inexpensive and will become a treasured addition to regular cookbooks."
5,Great item,This is a great item - the cover is a bit much but the size is excellent and you can print items on regular paper and punch and insert in the binder. Great value!
2,Disapppointed,"The book is very attractive, has good pages for inserts and recipe cards, however, the one I received had misaligned rings that did not close properly. In addition, I was disappointed and rather put off by the author's detailed memories printed on the back of each divider page. Her family memories are appropriate for her and her family, but not so appropriate for others. It spoiled the book for me and now I am hesitant to present it (with recipes) to my daughter-in-law-to-be at her bridal shower."
5,THE FROG PRINCE IS THE PERFECT BOOK,"I don't normally read much chick-lit, but thought I'd give this story a try - and am I glad I did! Jane Porter had me hooked by the end of Chapter One. Holly Bishop, with all her trials and tribulations, left me fascinated, but it was the ""heart"" of the story that really grabbed me. Holly Bishop could be any woman, and Jane Porter has written a beautiful story that reads utterly true and speaks from the heart. There's reality and truth and beauty sprinkled like fairy dust throughout the pages of this book, and the result is MAGICAL. Thank you, Jane Porter for sharing Holly's world with us all! I'll definintely be waiting for your next book!"
3,Just Okay,"I liked ""Flirting With Forty"" but I could have passed on this one. I will have to try her next book..."
2,A princess of a book turned into a frog...,"Everyone loves the story of the poor little waif who's swept from obscurity and poverty into the lap of luxury. This book tells what happens after the rice from the wedding is swept away -- and Prince Charming turns back into a frog.Porter's book starts out well as Holly tries to come to terms with her divorce from the Prince, reinventing herself as a single woman-about-town in San Francisco. But about two-thirds of the way through the book, Porter seems to lose interest, summing up months of time in a paragraph or two. She never regains momentum, and the book lapses into diatribe after diatribe on the need for women to love themselves, the need for mothers to let their children go, and the need for men to see the ""real"" woman, not just the perfect makeup.What started out with a bang ended in a whimper."
3,"An okay book, but as good as I hope","Holly Bishop is young woman in the course of one year got married and divorced. So now Holly finds herself in a new city, with a new job and now has to face dating again. Holly is looking for prince charming, but she is faced with a lot of frogs. This is a time where Holly will find changed and hopefully a prince.I read a lot good reviews of this book, I wanted to really like this book, but there was something about Holly I just didn't like. This was a good for the beach, but its not very deep."
4,A great first novel,"This one is Jane Porters first modern lit novel and it's a good one. It's a good story about a woman how needs to find herself and love after a bad relationship.You can easily see that Jane writes romance but I love the ending. It's not until Jane Porters ""The Good Woman"", that we see this type of an ending again.I have read all of Jane Porters modern lit novels and I'm glad that I began with this one."
4,WISH I HAD READ YEARS AGO,"This was a wonderful read. Just wish I had read it years ago!!! Ms. Porter has it totally right...WOMAN can control their own destiny & WE make our own decisions. Was very happy to read it...better late then never!!! Learned some life lessons. ALL women can learn from this book. Story crabs you from the start & by the end you will wind up a little younger & WISER!!!! Definitely give it a try, GLAD I DID!!!"
5,Miracle Product,When we purchased our house 2 years ago there glass-top stove had many stains on it and it looked very unsightly. I tried scrubbing it with a lot of different household products and finally gave up thinking it actually melted or compromised the glass itself. I saw this while searching for other things and thought I should try it as I didn't have much to lose. I received the product and cleaned the top twice with the included pads and it looks brand new. It completely got rid of the marks that I thought would be there forever. Simply a magical product!
5,Best Product for Ceramic cooktops,I love Cerama Bryte. I don't eve bother considering using or trying another product. This works great. It is easy and fast.
2,good but expensive for what it is,it worked but if you had a straight razor scraper( like the one you use for removing paint from windows) and some foaming 409 it would have done the same thing for about $5.00 it is not worth the money
5,Works Great!,"Cerama Bryte Ceramic Cooktop Cleaner (28 oz), Scraper and 9 Cleaning works great on my cooktop. The kits is exactly as discribed."
3,Fantastic Product but this combo is expensive,"In my case, the stains (greasy, cooked over repeatedly) could not be removed using 409+blade, as suggested. Instead Cerama Brite+pads cleaned everything up and made my cooktop look like new. You don't really need the scraper. You can just use carefully a replacement blade for utility knives. This set is expensive ($27, including shipping). You can buy the Cerama cleaner and 10 pads for about $15 from ACE hardware (free shipping to a local store). I have not checked extensively, but I am sure you can find these items cheaper in other webstores."
4,The cleaner and the pad worked very well,We tried the cleaner and the pad yesterday and they worked great. The cooktop really shined following the instructions for the cleaner and pad. The reason I did not give 5 stars was that we did not use the scraper so I can't say how well it would work or not. When and if we need to use the scraper and it works then I will add the 5th star.
4,Best Stuff,"This cleans my tops with less effort than with other cleaners I have tried. Also, the scraper is something I use more than I probably should. It is great for eliminating little bits the scrubbing has missed"
4,Good for what it does,Keeps the range very clean and the added accessories are put to use as well. Maybe a little high priced? Not really sure but 4 Stars for sure.
5,Right Product for the JOB,This is the cleaner that came with my appliance: CERAMA BRYTE.The shipment came with a half dozen sponges and a blade. The container is big- enough for two years. I put it in a smaller bottle so it is easy to use. If you have a glass cooktop this makes it shine!Recommended.
4,stove cleaner,"I use this product weekly to clean my smooth top stove. It works really well. You do have to purchase the pads to use with it more frequently than the cleaner, at least I do. It does the job."
4,Love this Stuff,"This product is amazing for cook tops but I also discovered it works great on cleaning soap scum from shower doors too. The greatest part is how easy it is to use, just wipe it on and wipe it off with a clean dry cloth. I have tried so many different products and nothing compares to this. Great Stuff...will always keep it in my supplies cupboard."
4,Worked,Was able to test some Chinese ceramic given as a gift as containing lead by the vinegar solution method - the simple swab method was negative.The swabs they provide are too big so I bought cosmetic swabs which had narrower heads and that was better.Definitely enough solution for at least 6 tests.
5,"Easy to use, ensure you read the instructions","I suspect if you get some medical swabs (lab grade) you could stretch the solution out beyond 4 tests. Can't beat the price for the comfort of knowing your home is free of lead paint, why home inspectors don't do this automatically is beyond me."
1,No Solution!,"I'm calling the company tomorrow...the vial with the ""solution"" has nothing in it. Not to mention, I was bummed you can only run 4 tests (although, I'm wondering if I can use one swab for more than one item). Am a new mother and was disappointed I can't use it."
3,use two products,"There are 2 different technologies for instant lead testing. I am suspicious of both and since I have a PhD in chemistry, my suspicions should mean something. I tested a white paint surface with 2 kits: one was positive and one was negative. So now what? If you need to know for sure, you will have to use a commercial lab. You might also want to read the Consumers Report article on the topic. For now, I will assume lead is present and act accordingly"
2,"Swabs too big, too little solutin","I followed directions, activated test by soaking swab. Tip of swab is TOO BIG to get out of bottle, so I had to dab solution on swabs to do test. I sure hope the results are correct. Quality control is terrible. Expensive mistake. Try another brand!"
3,Little bit disaponting,"I got this yesterday, and I was sadly a little disapointed. It is pretty small, which I was prepared for, but its also quite flat. Since there is no pictures where its shown from the side, I was hoping for it to be more 3D, with horns maybe pointing a little out, and not just to the sides. Also the ring which it's attatched to the silicone necklace is very big compared to the rest of the pendant, so it looks a bit odd.But, it's ok. Giving it 3 weak stars"
4,"Call Me Crazy, but I Liked This.","Just when I was getting sick and tired of the nonstop coverage of America's new beloved family, the Osbournes, daughter Kelly releases this cover of the song Madonna sent to No. 1. I expected to cringe. I feared recoiling in a fetal position in horror. And I wanted to give this single one star. Surprisingly enough, she pulls it off well. Kelly's voice won't make us forget about Whitney or Mariah, but she gives this guitar-fueled rendition a tough edge that vaguely recalls the brashness of Courtney Love. In my school of music, ""Papa Don't Preach"" gets a B."
5,Military atlas of the civil war,"Book is awesome, It has some great maps and outstanding information in the book. I purchased for my husband, a civil war history buff, and he absolutely flipped over it. Thanks for the opportunity for purchasing."
1,Goofy,"The cover of this book is ""History of Switzerland, 1499-1914"" by Oechsli, Paul and Paul. The actual facsimile seems to be ""The History of Switzerland"" by Zschokke.There is no record of the publisher (for the facsimile), no place, no date."
1,Waste of Money!!,I just wasted my money purchasing this CD. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this garbage. A basic common sense 1st grader story with horrible voices and tacky music.
2,ramp,i have a 2 door jeep and hardly any space to store this huge ramp. very heavy and bulky. but thanks to amazon's free shipping and return i lucked out. looking for a light and v simple ramp which wouldn't take much space and my golden can climb in the jeep.
4,Pet Ramp,"Ramp is very sturdy and heavy, my dog walks on it without fear of feeling insecure.It is very heavy for me to get in and out of the car, so only four stars."
1,Pet Gear Tri-Fold Pet Ramp,"We ordered this as our dog is aging, as are we. We were lifting a 50# dog in and our of our Forester. A friend has a ramp for her pets and suggested we get one. There was no weight given for the ramp in its description. When it arrived it was so heavy that we could hardly lift it inside the front door. Since we need to carry it with us and use it at both ends of a trip, there is no way we can get the ramp in or out of the vehicle. It remains unopened sitting in our house while we decide what to do with it as it is not useful to us. We would not have ordered it if we had known how heavy it is."
4,"Solid, functional and portable.",Overall a sturdy product. I've tried the steps and my dogs won't use them. I have two 60-65 lb dogs. Both adapted to this ramp with just a little coaxing. It is a bit heavy and the size makes it a little awkward to move so I wouldn't say it is super portable. I can use this to give my dogs access to the back of my SUV but it is too wide to use to lead them to the back seat.
5,Happy Dog and Owner,"We have a large husky mix dog who couldn't make the jump into the back of our Ford F-350. Lifting her up wasn't so fun for my husband either! The pet ramp is still a little steep for the high truck bed, but with a little practice it is working great. It folds up neatly and we just keep it in the back of the truck. I was especially impressed with the price - we could have paid twice as much."
3,Lightweight & Sturdy,"This is a great light weight ramp for my 60# dog. He was hesitant to use it at first and he would slide down because he would go to slow up and down, but now that he has the hang of it he waits for me to bring it out instead of trying to bypass it. It is bulky and does not stow away nicely anywhere in the car, but for the price, it works well."
3,It's a ramp,"As far as ramps go, this one is ok. The surface scratches fairly easily, and its stability strap isn't long enough for all car types (my Element doesn't have a latch close enough to hook it to. The ramp itself is kind of wavy when stepped on, which meant my dog absolutely refused to use it. I would have liked a more solid ramp. Finally, while it folds up well, the latch holding it together is kind of flimsy for the weight of the ramp itself.Overall, it's decent, and does what it says, but I'll be looking for a more sturdy one in the future."
4,NON SLIP NOT GOOD,The non-slip surface started to tear up after the first couple of uses by my 85 LB. Yellow Lab. Installed outdoor carpet w/double sided tape& it works great.
1,Waste of $75.,"Can't believe I spent so much money on something so bad. The ramp itself isn't horrible, but the ""skid-resistant surface"" does NOT offer ""safe, sure footing."" It's basically like sandpaper and scrapes my dog's feet, and he has to scramble on it - no traction whatsoever. Whenever I touch it, it also scrapes my fingertips, leaving them dry and irritated for a few days. I would return this, but my dog's nails have already marked up this awful surface. I can't understand why they wouldn't've made it rubber traction. I guess I could glue some carpet pieces to it, but then I am spending more money on something that was already way overpriced. What a waste!"
1,Item will not hold up to 200 pounds,I purchased this item for my nine month old Great Dane who was 130 pounds at the time. He was nervous jumping into the back of my SUV so I purchased this ramp to ease him in. This ramp says it is for dogs up to 200 pounds. I have used the ramp for several trips and today the ramp actually buckled when my dog was walking up it. He is 130 pounds now and there is no way this ramp could hold 200. Now he is really scared to get into the back of my car. This could have caused him serious injury if I had not been paying attention. The area that buckled is not at the hinge where you would expect. One of the panels that make up the ramp actually buckled.
2,Pet Gear Trifold Dog Ramp,"This was too high priced for a large dog ramp, where the dog slips & 2 people need to help. One to hold the ramp so it doesnt slip, the other to guide the dog down, so it doesn't slip. It need maybe to be carpeted, and better gripping top & bottom. It bounces from the weight of the animal, and folding isn't fun either. I wished I could have seen it in a store first. I would have had second thoughts."
1,Does not hold 200lbs!!,"Bought this for my 186lb Mastiff, I've had it less than 2 months and it's already starting to buckle and break at one of the folds. It would probably be ok for a dog no more than 100lbs. It's also fairly large and heavy - even when folded up, making it kind of a pain to fit the dog and the ramp in the car at the same time."
3,Pet Gear Tri-Fold Pet Ramp,"I bought this ramp for my 100 pound dog, thinking that a ramp that handles 200 pounds would be more than adequate. Much to my surprise, after using it only about 10 times, while going up the ramp my dog buckled the top ramp! I went into Amazon to return it as defective but needed to pay return shipping! It was easier/less expensive to find a handyman to reinforce it. I would say that my experience with this ramp and my first purchase with Amazon was not a good one!"
1,Too Heavy and Cumbersome,"This ramp would be fine for a really strong person, but a really strong person could just lift the dog up! I needed a ramp to help my 50 lb dog get into the car, so im lifting this 30 lb ramp - way to heavy. Also, the way it folds makes it difficult to maneuver. Yesterday, I dropped the darn thing on my foot trying to unfold it."
2,Dog Car Ramp,"I found this Dog Ramp to be too slipery for my 110# Weimaraner. It had to be substantially modified with non-skid and ""Charlie"" had to be re-trained."
5,Sturdy and Portable,"I purchased this for my pot bellied pig. Right now she's only 35lbs and I can pick her up to put her in a car crate, but soon she'll be too big for me to pick up. She doesn't like to walk on the ramp so I ""treat"" her up with banana or popcorn. I am concerned that it is a steep drop off at the top of the ramp. If she panicked for any reason, she could fall and injure herself. But it's a necessary tool that will be important when I need to drive her to the vet. So right now I'm training her to feel comfortable walking up this steep ramp."
5,Great Ramp for a Big Dog,"I have tried several different options for helping my old Great Dane get into and out of my SUV easily. Stairs were difficult, another product that actually attached and twisted under my car broke off on the freeway, and other ramps didn't get compact enough. With this ramp, he has good traction, and it folds up relatively small, considering that it is strong enough to hold 250 pounds worth of dog.We had a little bit of trouble at first as my dog doesn't know where his back feet are at all times, but he's doing great with it now.I did have to replace the safety strap, but other than that, it's great!"
1,Large Dog Ramp,"The ramp was advertised to carry up to 200 lbs and the box showed it with a 250 lb max.The ramp would bend and shake with my 180 lb dog on it and did not seem too stable.Also with just a few uses, his nails had scratched through the non-skid surface and was already looking very poor.I would not buy this ramp again for a large dog."
2,Looks great at first but don't be fooled,"I was really disappointed. At first you think it's great. It folds up,is easy to carry and it sets up really fast. The disappointing part is that it states that it's for dogs up to 200lbs and my dogs weighs about 120lbs. On the 3rd use it broke. The end part that rests on the vehicle snapped and my poor 10 year old dog fell with the ramp as it collapsed under him. Fortunately it wasn't too far to the ground and he was just stiff for a few days.I guess it would be fine if you have a REALLY light weight dog, but I wouldn't trust it with any dog that weighs much more than 50 lbs.LisaCastle Rock, CO"
4,improve pet ramp,"The Tri-Fold Pet Ramp is convenient and fits easily into our SUV.It is a little on the heavy side for one person.The ramp surface is like fine sandpaper and our dogs were slipping on it.Their nails were making scratches in the surface and in handling it, it is abrasive to the skin.I bought a piece of outdoor carpet and a can of carpet glue.I cut the carpet at 18 inches by 6 feet long.I glued this carpet to the ramp surface and slit the carpet at the two fold areas.Now the dogs go right up and down, do not slip and it is no longer abrasive to handle.--Pet Gear Tri Fold Ramp"
4,Not For Him...,"I love it! As a matter of fact, I love it, but my dog doesn't like it and is afraid. It takes lots of patience to convince him to go up the ramp and I even climbed up on it to ""show him,"" (do you hear me say that I'm showing the dog how to walk the ramp?)(sure you didn't) and he just wasn't having it! So, it is folded up in the basement. Wasted $75 but perhaps another dog later. This dog is 115 pounds and what he says, ""goes!"" Quality is good. Has a sand-paper like feel on the running board which can be ddeterring bt overall, I would recommend it!"
2,Tri Fold Pet Ramp,its ok but very scary for pets I can't get my dog to go up it he is afraid of falling off it.. poor thing.. needs to be a little wider. and the floor hurts there paws
3,Needs a Better Surface,"I got his for my lab mix who is partially handicapped with less than full control over his rear legs. Lifting a wiggling 55 lb animal is a disaster waiting to happen. I like the design as it folds up nicely and fits will in the back of my Explorer. Yes, it is heavy, but not as heavy as my dog (and my dog does not have a handle). With a little practice it is easy to unfold and set up.My complaint is with the surface. It is non-slip only if you are wearing soft soled shoes. Basically, the surface is sandpaper. My dog tries and fails to grip the surface with his nails, so he slips and slides a lot trying to climb the ramp. I am sure the ramp will be fine when I glue on a rubberized surface so my dog can get a proper grip."
1,"Way too clunky and heavy, non-slip finish already wearing off.","I'm returning to amazon because the non-slip finish is already wearing off after minimal use. However, I would rate this product poorly even if that didn't happen. It's too heavy for a dog ramp, it's clunky and difficult to close. No way is it compact, either."
1,too bulkey,"this tri fold ramp is huge when it's folded up, about 10 inches thick. it's also extremely heavy. i hated it. i sent it back to amazon. the return was very easy, i didn't even have to pay return shipping."
5,Trifold dog ramp,This ramp is light weight yet sturdy and very easy to set up and take down. Our greyhound had never used a ramp before. We found laying it flat on the ground and allowing her to walk back and forth on it gave her confidence to walk on it when elevated.
4,Not as bad as all that...,"This is a pretty good Vampire book from the prospective of the vampire. The nice thing about it is that there is only a touch of angst, and even that little bit is cut short by other vampires who cannot stand self pity. A pretty good book. Players of Vampire: the Masquerade will especially like this book as the various vampires are pretty archetypical to the various clans (Feasting's vampires do not have clans, however)."
4,A Good Vampire Novel,"This book might rely on coincidence as a plot device too often, but overall ""The Time of the Feasting"" is a good read. The book is a smooth read that holds the readers attention till the end and the ""melrose place"" drama between the various vampires is interesting enough. The ending is a bit weak and improbable though."
2,Where's the real Mick Farren?,"Mick Farren is one of my favorite authors. He's written some really great cyberpunk and sci-fi novels. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I discovered this book at the library. At first I was very excited, because I hadn't seen any books by him in a long time and thus wasn't expecting to see this one. But when I started reading it, it was sooo bad that I had to start skimming through it trying to find the good parts. What a surprise! There weren't any! Argh!!! So .. if you want to read good vampire fiction, read Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series. And if you want to read excellent Mick Farren fiction, find any or all of the following books: Their Master's War; The Armageddon Crazy; The Long Orbit; The Last Stand of the DNA Cowboys; Mars: The Red Planet."
1,This book stinks!!!!,"This is the worst vampire book ever written. Not only was it very poorly constructed, it was full of impossible situations, coincidences, and other general baloney. The ending was rushed and smacked of sheer laziness on the part of the writer"
3,Mundane,"The book kept me waiting, for action that did'nt happen. Its an OK book, If you like vampires."
3,Mediocre,"Having read a lot of books - both old and new -- in the vampire genre, I can say that I found this to be strictly middle-of-the-road. It certainly isn't the worst but it's a long way from the top ten.The story isn't very origional but then again there isn't much origional about vampires anymore. The writing was good; sound and evocative. Unfortunately there was little to no charactor development. You just didn't care one wy or the other about any of them, good guys or bad. Also there were contradictions all over the place. For instance, why could vampires at the Residence get up during the day if necessary, yet Cynara was unable to move at her hotel room? Lots of loose ends, too. Obviously left for the sequel. Hope it's better!"
2,Don't believe any of the hype,While I was expecting a good book from all the great reviews I instead found a very mediocre book Don't get me wrong it was interesting to read once but it just wasn't anything I hadn't seen done before (or done better) in other vampire books
1,Sorry,"While I read the book, and honestly tried to enjoy it, I found the story to be poorly written and full of cliches. It wasn't the fresh, new look at vampire fiction I'd been lead to believe it was."
1,For parties only.,Will be very good for parties where persons attending have little or no square dance training since movements are very limited and can be leart quickly. Not a CD for serious square dance beginners since not all the calls are those specified by Callerlab.
1,The Worst!,"I'm an elementary school physical education teacher, always on the lookout for good square dance discs. Although I call my own dances to instrumental only discs, occasionally I like to get a disc with calls done for me. This is the WORST square dance disc I've ever heard! The band is bad enough, but Slim calls the dances in the most hideous off key monotone... and he sounds bored doing it to boot! Don't say you weren't warned!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"The book is a little thin but remember dont judge a book by its cover. The pictures are GREAT!!! I have been a cichlid breeder for about 25 years and just recently i went into africans and this was one of my first books. The only problem is that it doesnt elaborate on some things, but its a great book."
3,Good but,"This is a good book with beautiful glossy pictures, but the information in it is very basic. The first 44 pages is devoted to setup, equipment and water with adverts thrown in under the guise of showing you equipment that you should buy for your cichlids. If you are experienced with aquariums(I have maintained different types for over 25 years) you will find most of the first 44 pages a ""101"" course. The last 20 pages of the book suggests beginner fish for your tank, which I found useful as this was my first African cichlid tank.A good beginner book, but a bit thin on info about the actual fish."
1,This is legend not document history,"If all the ""old tailored fatimists"" as catholics wanted open their eyes and minds we would have for sure a much better religious and spiritual confort and global reward. Its amazing that recently the Portuguese daily press published a ""recomendation"" from Vatican after the meeting of Pope Benedict XVI with the bishops of Portugal, concluding that the catholicism in this country was ""too much centered in the Marian cult"". A good point of departure for any sincere believer that wants to know the true and original documents of Fatima 1917 also known by ""Fatima I"" by Portuguese scholars Dr. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada. Read ""Celestial Secrets"" and ""Heavenly Lights""."
1,This is called revisionism,"First of all, let me say that I have a deep respect for the catholic faith, even though I'm agnostic. That said, there's one deeply disturbing fact about this book : it's manipulating old and recent history to prove a theory, which is that Marian apparitions have had an impact on the course of our world. Just a couple of examples : Marian apparitions shortened the 2nd World War (weather on D Day could have been really bad, you see), prevented France from suffering from a civil war in 1947 (never heard about it before) and accelerated the fall of Communism. My advice : if you want to read an OBJECTIVE book about Marian apparitions (if such a thing can simply exist !), just don't buy this one..."
3,One Fantastic Gem in Here,"A dense textbook (3 stars), yet a 5 star, four page gem: The ""Busy Reader Style"" What a concept! Enable your reader to decide as soon as possible if the text is relevant (using good titles, sub-titles, first sentences...) Thank you Mr. Chandler."
5,No More Nasty is Great!,"I originally chose to read No More Nasty because it was the first book available to me from my summer reading list. I didn't expect much. Once I started reading it, I realized that it was not a chore but quite enjoyable. The main character Simon is sitting in his classroom waiting for school to start. He finds out that his teacher is not coming and they will be having a substitute. He gets quite a surprise when the substitute turns out to be his great aunt Mattie. He really likes aunt Mattie but she is a little(or alot) different. She doesn't behave like other teachers. The other kids in the class make fun of Mattie and Simon doesn't want them to make fun of him for liking her. I liked the way it ends. In fact, I read the book No More Nice that came before No More Nasty to find out more about his adventures with Aunt Mattie. That was just as good! This is an exellent series of books. I hope there will be more stories about Simon and Aunt Mattie to come."
5,koooool,"we had told our kids about this movie, they have search thevideo stores and locate retail store but no one carries thismovie. But when i located on amazon website, i purchased it andnow my kids can enjoy this movie as we did when we were kids.my kids think our 80's movie were funny, thank you"
4,The Fighters,"The film was produced in 1995. Popular actors are Chris Owen and Ariana Richards. You might have seen them in American Pie or Jurassic Park. The film is funny, because it is about a fat boy (Angus) and a pretty girl (Melissa), who dance together at the prom of their school. It's a fascinating romance. Angus often has problems at school and he solves his problems in an interesting way. It's a romance, because Angus gets Melissa in the end. In my opinion the film is about a fat boy, who dances with a famous girl, which shows that your character matters more than your outer appearance and that it's not important how you look, but who you are! See it the same way ? Than what are you waiting for ? Enjoy the film!"
3,dang,"This movie is so awesome (so is the short story by Chris Crutcher). I don't have the DVD yet, but do own the VHS. It's too good not to have the DVD, but now I read from the reviews that it's poorly done. Why??? Please oh please release a good version!"
2,Blah,"I'm a big Stephen Lynch fan, but this is pretty dull. Rent the movie, or buy one of his comedy albums instead."
3,Came broken :(,The CD was in fine condition but the CD case was cracked :( Not sure if it was the seller or shoty post office
2,Great Performances Do Not a Musical Make,"The score captures the 80s style fairly well...but the lyrics are mostly cliche. True, it's not supposed to Sondheim, but couldn't there be a bit of wit involved. That having been said, it's so much better than ""Footloose"" or ""Saturday Night Fever""...and thank goodness it's not a jukebox musical. That would have been a disaster.Great energy and sound. Great performances by the leads. A few great songs that will not stand the test of time. The show itself will probably make the high school rounds in a couple of years."
3,Doing this as our Musical this Year....,"Purchased this CD because our HS is doing this in the spring, and I'm conducting the pit.Music is okay, but if you are doing this in a High School, you will probably need to edit this performance, especially if you are performing it for a middle school group. Mentions jello shots, references to drinking occur frequently, calling girls skanks, the cuss-filled lament song after the breakup, etc... For an adult audience the lyrics are the most amusing part, but musically it is not challenging... or for that matter, interesting. The student who was trying out for the lead part learned every main tune by ear in a day or 2.Funny for those who lived through the 80's big hair decade with outrageous fashion and ...well, as I like to say, nothing good came out of the 80's except the movie, ""Predator"".So if you are performing this, get the disc, it helps. If not... watch the Adam Sandler Drew Barimore film instead."
3,THE WEDDING SINGER>>>so what's the celebration?,"I may need to see the movie version to tie all the songs together. But I am not really moved by any of the tunes in THEWEDDING SINGER. Its not a ""grabber"" for me, the way BILLY ELLIOTis. Teri"
3,"Not Bad, But Others This Season Are Better","This is a fun cd, but others this season are better. Try ""Jersey Boys"" or ""The Drowsy Chaperone""."
2,Nice for a once over,"Yes there are a few good songs on the disk, the srongest being the opening and closing numbers. I did find myself skipping around and really only being able to re-listen to about 5 songs off the disk. If you can get a good price on a used copy then go for it, otherwise you might find it a bit of a waist of $15."
2,Formula Blahs,"I love musicals, and I really wanted this to be good. Also, I think Stephen Lynch is an excredibly talented performer. I was was excited to see him go to Broadway. But this muscial comes across as very fomulaic and uninteresting. The things that are supposed to be interesting have all been done better in other musicals, i.e., Hairspray, The Producers. All the songs started to sound a like to me. I think Broadway needs to stop looking at Hollywood movies for their ideas."
4,It's Not Meant To Be Sondheim - Just Plain Fun!,"Based on the classic film starring Adam Sandler & Drew Barrymore, ""The Wedding Singer"" is a light romantic comedy set in a world of 80s-filled nostalgia. The musical never takes itself too seriously, but instead brings back many memories of that decade's pop culture.Led by Stephen Lynch & Laura Bananti, the cast sounds great, but the songs are a mixed bag - most terrific, some not so much. Overall, this is an enjoyable, fun cd and worth the purchase (especially, if you can catch the show), but the score's unlikely to stand the test of time for theatre lovers.Best Tracks:It's Your Wedding DaySomedayCasualty Of LoveSaturday Night In The CityIf I Told YouLet Me Come Home"
1,A one joke wonder,"Nothing great here folks, just one big look At Me I'm an 80s' Show. Some good spots, but nothing to really write home about."
2,"Umm....Its not art, its corporate Greed","I saw this show and this is probably the only show I ever wanted to walk out on, and I saw Brooklyn. The musical is a wannabe ""Hairspray"" but it fails in every way possible. It is unoriginal and a regurgitated version of the movie. Stephen Lynch is a great, and funny solo comedian but can't act. He does have a nice voice. Lauren Benanti is no Drew Barrymore. The music and lyrics are pretty bad, and anything but art. This show is a cash cow and that its only purpose. Fun or not, this show should not be on Broadway."
1,A Completely Undistinguished Cast Recording,"I feel I wasted my money when I purchased this one. I played it once, and decided there was no need to play it again. For me, it's an earache with few redeeming qualities. If I were younger and into wild music, it might be palatable. This one is destined for the trash."
5,One tough socket,"I purchased this socked to use with an 18"" breaker bar to remove the stubborn center bolt on my lawn tractor blades. This socket withstands a great deal of pressure and I highly recommend it for tough jobs."
1,Time to retire,"The only thing worse than this Dice performance is the fact that I had to pay money to watch it. Dice was simply the best circa 1988-1994. He was hilarious and inventive. But there's nothing uglier than a man closing in on his fifties in a black leather jacket spilling out re-hashed dirty joke after re-hasehed dirty joke. While Dice was suitable entertainment when I was 13- 20-years-old, I now find his humor to be ignorantly rude, out of line, and, the bottom line, not funny anymore. His mysoginist act clicked when he had a youthful vibe. But it's time for him to either re-invent his act or get out of comedy. This show was especially sour for my taste after viewing a brilliant Richard Pryor video, ""Here and Now,"" the previous weekend."
4,AN OUTSTANDING WORK,"As a traveller to the land of Israel twelve times I have been privileged to see first rate the expertise that went into the pages of this book and I have had many positve comments from those I have shared the book with. A preacher's son describes the part on the ""Ark of The Covenant"" as an exceptional writing done by an expert in her field. The book is a must for anyone going to the Holyland."
3,Not helpful for guided tours,"I recently returned from a trip to Israel and I had purchased this book before the trip as a guide. I never opened the book even once 1) because we had an excellent tour guide, and 2) because it includes way more places than what is necessary. The information in the book is quality but if you are going with a tour I wouldn't bother with it. If you are exploring on your own I would recommend it. I would like to see maps in this book to show where these locations are and perhaps organized by region rather than just alphabetically. If you want a great resource to take with you purchase the ""DK Eyewitness Guide of Jerusalem and the Holy Land."" I thoroughty enjoyed it."
1,"An OK companion book, but not a good guide","Fills in some bits of info, but not good as a guide book. Something entitled ""How To Walk in the Footsteps of Jesus"" should be fairly expected to have a map of Jesus' travels during his ministry, but there is none. No map of Galilee or what there would be to see to trace Jesus' ministry. Terrible maps of ancient Israel and Jerusalem."
4,Love ALLAN HOLDSWORTH? Worth every penny!,"I bought this book for the tabs, but soon realized it has a great biography about him and his interests! From his history to his favorite drinks, Allan was an awsome guy. It has some neat photos and of course, guitar notation for guitarists. So, if you want to learn how to play some of his songs by book, then GET THIS NOW! Or it's perfect for some good Allan Holdsworth history lessons. I loved it!"
1,big disappointment,"I was expecting this book to contain some insights regarding how Allan constructs the amazing sequences that he plays. The title and the image on the cover suggest as much. Unfortunately the book basically contains a bio, some pictures, and some quotes. If you're looking for musical insights, look elsewhere. I'm recycling mine."
2,Not Sturdy / Not Complex,"Our three children LOVE their ""Fun Flap"" books but this one comes up short:1) The pages are paper, with flimsy paper flaps that will not withstand our children's (ages 3/3/4) rough usage.2) The flaps do not take the children deeper into the topic, as do most of the ""Lift-the-Flap"" series books. The flaps simply hide something cute; they fail to explain and, therefore, miss the entire opportunity to further the children's intellectual development."
5,"Excellent, helpful, informative, easy to understand,","This book helps families learn a new way to interact with difficult children. Mostly it shows parents how to interact with children period. It gives insightful tips on controlling your own life and thus what happens to all others around you. When this is accomplished, anything is possible. It also gives resources available to families in need of them. Mostly hope and a new way of approaching the old issue of parenting. By Controlling Your Own Life, the world is seen through different eyes. More relaxed, more insightful, focused, confident, self-assured, and thus positive, capable, etc. A must read for families with difficult children, children period. It gives you advise on navigating the education maze and how to handle road blocks."
5,Excellent,"Dr. Makarowski has hit on something that can carry over to all aspects of adult life, making this much more than a simple parenting book. Scripps Howard News Service"
5,One of the best books I read in the last twenty years,"One of the best books I have read in the last twenty years...first of its kind...applications are universal...great benefit to me, my administrators, teachers, parents and ultimately the students that are served in my school district.. an effective informational vehicle to educate parents...I particularly liked the sample exercises and the protocols from which individual and group work might be initiated...very powerful...It integrates behavior and stress management techniques with practical parenting strategies. I believe that this melding will prove useful to many conscientious parents with school age children. Frank Cranley, Superintendent of Schools"
1,Quite useless and boring information,"As a Mexican I bought this book expecting to read about the various social and cultural customes that make mexicans unique, as presented about different countries in other Culture Shock books..Unlike those, I found this one full with historic data, that unless you are interested in Mexican history, would not find useful. Only Pages 101 to 110 have some information relevant to a culture shock book. The rest of the book is rather boring and with a lot of useless accounts and anecdotes.I am sure there are other books that focus on the Cultural Difference of mexicans that would be more interesting than this."
3,What a Shock,"Not recommended. The biggest shock was the author's pedantry. The first third of the book is an obscure treatment of history which assumes too much knowledge on the part of the reader. The book needs a glossary with the pronunciation of unusual spanish words, names, and places. I found myself constantly stumbling over them."
1,Mind blowing?!?!,I should have known that it wasn't real Kama Sutra. cosmo just makes it up as they go.
3,"Great book, but. . .","You really need patience and stamina to attempt and achieve quite a few of the positions demonstrated here. But have fun trying, I know *I* will."
3,The Cosmo Kama Sutra: 77 Mind-Blowing Sex Positions,The book came in a timely fashion and nicely package for privacy. Interesting content!!!
2,Read Cosmopolitan,The book wasn't that much different than what I read in Cosmpolitan magazine. I am familiar with the positions in the book - I just knew them by a different name. The book was not informative to me at all!
3,Ok book,"I bought this book sometime ago. I liked how it wasn't rawnchy like some other books out there. There are pictures of actual people doing the deal, but drawings, so I am not comparing myself to some size 2 girl pulling these moves off. I would let a friend barrow it, but I wouldn't buy it again if it got lost."
2,Not pleasurable at all!,"UNCOMFORTABLE! Most of these positions were created out of desperation for ""NEWNESS"" opposed to created for pleasure and good sex! It is as though the point were not to create sexual satisfaction, but to test the couples physical flexibility and endurance for discomfort."
5,Great!,I have to show my age. When I was little I watched Jabber Jaws on TV. Now I have a 7 year old step son who just loves sharks. So naturally I went looking for this show on video. He absolutely loves it. He has just about worn the tape out from watching every night before bed and first thing in the morning. We do not allow him to watch much TV. but Jabber Jaws is a must for him to even go to sleep. It is just how I remembered it and good clean family fun. That is hard to find now a day with hidden adult meanings and violence in some cartoons.
4,Our neighbors the Bonobos,"This is a very beautiful book about the bonobo primates. I bought it for my 7 year-old grandson but his father thought we should wait two or three years before the boy saw the explicit photos of bonobo courtship and related practices. After looking more closely, I think he is right."
3,purchase review,"I purchased the book ""Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape"" for a gift, and received the item in good time and in good condition. I am unfamiliar with the book itself. I would purchase from the company again."
5,"Bonobo, you are not forgotten","This is a ground breaking book which forces humans to realize that not all of the great apes are violent as chimpanzees have been pigeonholed. It ultimately questions our humanness in relation to our 2 closest relatives: chimps & bonobos. Humans have characteristics of both, then why do many humans believe human nature is violent? This book gives us a mirror to see ourselves in."
4,The Place to Start,"I cannot imagine a better place to begin learning about Bonobos than this book. It is written in layman's terms and is accompanied by some exquisite photography. This book will set you on your way to exploring more of this ""forgotten ape."" The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the book's short length (less than 200 pages with a lot of pictures). Solidly recommended for anyone interested in human evolution, primatology, or psychology."
1,Not worth watching,"This home-movie issue is neither worth the twenty minutes of watching nor the $24.95 cost. There is nothing to be learned as the dancers do the Swan Lake Act I pas de deux a couple of times with little or no correction, other than that given in Russian, which is of no use to non-Russian speakers. If this video is supposed to be semi-instructional and entertaining, it fails."
1,BAD BUSINESS,"I will never order any item from this supplier ever again. I ordered the product and when I received it I was shocked. I was not what I thought it was, the base was plastic and I do not believe there was any bronze on it at all. When I contacted the supplier I was informed that I would need to pay the return shipping charge and if I did not ship fedex or HDL they would not apply a credit. After all was said and done it cost me approx $70.00 to view this product. I believe there decription was deceptive and they would not work with me at all to resolve the issue. Besides the shipping charges for both way they also deducted a restocking fee from my credit. I would have kept the item if I just changed my mind but the item was not what I felt it would be. It was a cheap copy and looked as such."
2,Received it broken!,"We loved the globe and were disappointed when it arrived broken. It was not even packed for shipping. Just basically thrown in a box. Also, for the price of the globe we expected better quality than what we saw in person. Nice looking in picture but the price and quality don't match. We didn't reorder, just returned it! Bummer!"
1,Cannot fit the globe to the statue. It appears the casting of the bronze is off.,Denny Fanetti - A Christmas gift for my grandson and could not assemble because of poor manufacturing. Now the hassle of returning.
2,Sorry but doesn't miss something somewhere ?!!!!,"I will not say that Abel Ferrara is not creative in his own way to make movies. This work proves that there is someone behind the camera full of ideas and a great thinker, No doubt about it. The problem is just the story.It could have been a great one but dunno what happened. It becomes easily boring and it's a pity. Acting is okay. Walken's got a little role in it, 10 minutes maximum.If you are curious about Abel Ferrara, well It's still worth few bux."
4,Mostly metaphor.,"It's not about vampires, it is about resistance, or lack of it. About what may be right around the corner, about discipline, or about lack of discipline. About being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It can happen to anybody, and it happens to everybody. It's a pyramid scheme.Beautiful black and white composition by Abel Ferrara tied tightly in a wonderfully creative Joe Delia score. Casting the usual Ferrara/indie suspects: Paul Calderone, Edie Falco, Kathryn Erbe, Lili Taylor, Annabella Sciorra. The theme of the movie presents 4 new questions for every one it answers. Do we have a choice? Can we resist? And just when we think we have it all figured out, Christopher Walken has to show up and throw an entirely new lilt on things.Such is life."
1,Find Something Else To Do With Your 90 Minutes!,"This was an awful movie. Existential, philosophical vampires portrayed as addicts. Nothing redeeming about it. Skip it."
1,MINUS 5 STARS.. & THEN SOME,"THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I HAVE ""EVER"" WALKED OUT OV THE THEATER FROM IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.. I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT!"
5,Vampires get smart!,This film was delicious! A joy to watch. Lili Taylor has proven once again that she can do anything. I loved the letterbox format in black and white. It adds an air of class and a certain mystique. Very well done!
1,Book is a big disappointment.,"This book is mostly a list of articles and stuff the author found on the Internet. Since this book was published in 2003, it does not contain the most recent and up-to-date information. You are probably better off doing a search on a scholarly database to find the most recent information."
4,"""I Love Lucy"" Season 4","I'm glad I purchased the video, but unfortunately some of the Hollywood story lines I was hoping to see weren't in the 4th season, so I guess the story line continued at the beginning of Season 5. If you want all the Hollywood episodes, you will need to purchase Seasons 4 and 5."
1,disappointing,I'm stationed overseas and I bought this last season 4 of I Love Lucy simply because I could not find it here. It was disappointing it looks like this video is of poor quality. When the characters in the movie are talking the audio is about 3 seconds behind. I find this extremely disappointing!
5,Perfect,This was a good deal for a great addition to my DVD collection of classic TV shows. Still looking for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and then I'll be pretty much complete.
3,package was broke,"the case to the movie was broke when i opened it. the movie still works,but it was broke. any way good movie"
2,I LOVE LUCY - 4TH SEASON,"I thought I was buying a new set, however I was sent a used set. Because they skip all the time you are watching them.I was very disappointed."
5,Great fun!,We are thoroughly enjoying the I Love Lucy series. Our seventeen-year-old watches them repeatedly. Fred is his favorite:) You can't go wrong with any of the seasons of this great show.
5,You got to love Lucy,I mean who doesn't love Lucy? This was ordered for a Christmas gift for my daughter. I've bought 3 so far........ Great fun.
4,great season,The dvds come in a nice slip case. I have all but season 6 and 7-9. This is a very funny show and Lucille Ball was a great comedian. Now where is The Lucy Show?
5,"""i Love Lucy"", don't we always?","These Lucy tapes are as funny as always and certainly timeless. We enjoy watching them again and again. Good humor will last. Lucy, Ricky, Ethel, and Fred are just great. I recommend this set to all lovers of Lucy."
4,still funny!,"Season four is still extremely funny, but I don't really like the ones where they are on the road as much."
5,"""California, Here We Come!""","I Love Lucy Season 4 has always been my favorite season. The development in the show's plot seems to unfold more in this season than in any other. Ricky's showbiz career starts to take off, for example.in these very classic episodes, which spawned many other television sit-coms, Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred travel to Hollywood where Ricky will star in his first hit movie, 'Don Juan'.During their travels, they stop at Ethel's hometown in New Mexico. She stars in a ""homecoming"" show and thinks that she's the queen---but Lucy and Co. have other plans!!!A lot of celebrities make cameo appearances on the show during this season. While in Hollywood, Lucy throws a pie into Bill Holden's face, makes John Wayne fall into a box full of wet cement, and sets her nose on fire while trying to disguise herself from her favorite celebrities.Great, great season! There isn't one single episode that WON'T have you rolling over laughing!Sound quality is a bit poor, however. Too bad."
2,great show 5 stars but bad dvd packaging,"I am collecting all of the seasons, I was disappointed to see how this ""Box set"" put everything in one container and not individually like the other (pre 2012) box sets. I like to pick which episodes I want to watch by looking at the disc package.. I plan to return this set and go back to the $29.00 version."
1,Really?,"This is quite possibly the most boring book I've ever read, and it usually takes a lot to get me to lose interest. Honestly, I would not choose this as a potential leisure read."
3,Deep Survival,"A friend suggested this book to me, and I wanted to like it, but I can't get into this one. It's not a dull book, but I can easily put it down and come back to it a week later. It's not one of those reads that you can't put it down until you're done. I won't be re-reading this one."
3,Deep Survival,"The subject matter of this book is riveting and I learnt some very valuable things from this book. I would have given this 4 or 5 stars if the author wrote in a more straightforward manner.The continual chopping and changing of subject became tedious .I know that writers are taught to do this in creative writing courses to maintain tension,but this was like watching a boxer who telegraphs all his moves.It becomes predictable rather than tension making(like the continuous cutting back to the World Trade Centre ).I also felt this writer needs to get his considerable ego out of the way and just tell us the incredible stories that he has in his material.The material should speak for itself we (readers ) don't need to be overly entertained like children with attention deficit problems . Having said all that I still recommend this book."
1,Could have been much better- save your time and money,"This book is poorly written and while the examples were interesting, the writing unfortunately was confusing and unclear. Save your money and buy ""The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes - and Why"" by Amanda Ripley instead, which is very well written and informative. Deep Survival was too shallow and did not have enough information or details to be helpful."
1,Disappointed,"This book was disappointing. It was very disappointing that the author felt it necessary to use extreme coarse language in this book. I understand his justification in doing so to help the reader relate to the type of characters portrayed in the book. Conversely, the coarse language is not necessary to accurately describe the situations presented. I was offended at this language and it only ruined my excitement in reading it. Survival is an exciting subject and I will be looking for other books to read and throwing this one in the garbage. This book had more science about survival than exciting survival stories with survival strategies. The information was interesting, but more like reading a textbook."
3,"Deep Survival, by Lawrence Gonzalis","Entertaining, but disappointing book. Survival based more on pure luck than ""know how""."
3,Perhaps a good message but not a good messenger,"Many books are written about interesting subjects. But if the writer cannot convey their message in a readable manner, all is lost. Such is Deep Survival. Also, I didn't appreciate many 4-letter words. I wish Amazon would have a guide alerting buyers about vulgarity in books."
2,Verbose and Redundant,"After reading the reviews on the book's back cover, I thought I was in for a real treat. Turned out to be a big disappointment. I wish I could return it actually."
2,Very slow in getting to the point,"I recommend against this book. It is extremely slow. If I need to fall asleep, I start reading this book again. The book has potential, but never lives up to it. I feel like writing about how the author could've or should've, but why waste my time and yours. Oh, and how old is this guy to keep writing about how great his daddy is. . . ."
2,ghost of the father,"The purpose of this book seems to be bragging about the author's innumerable accomplishments. It would be interesting to know whether he ever did enough to get his father's approval and love. Somehow, I doubt it.In the story about Mt Hood he analyzed why the accident happened but he didn't explain why some people died and some didn't. Maybe he couldn't find a rational explanation.I didn't like the book because I think that the author was more on an ego trip than anything else."
1,Could get though the first chapter.,"Maybe I'm pretentious but this author can't seem to tell a story. This book would be fine if it were science, and great if it were story, but it tries to find some middle ground and winds up with not enough of either."
2,Heavy-handed Style vs. Content - who ya got?,"This book was a major disappointment. The author seems to be trying so hard to write with a snarky, mega-cool style that he forgets what he's writing about and just jags off to the rhythm of his words. This gets very tedious after a while. If you really want to read about survival, get any book by Jon Krakauer."
5,Very informative,"Laurence Gonzales describes many of these true stories of survival epics, that start from the smallest trivial acts and escalates to a full blown survival situation. Each story covers a different wilderness survival scenario. He describes how the individual got there, the emotional states, thought processes, how that individual or individuals acted or reacted, their out come and why.Much of his explanation is back by research of scientific and philosophical literature. Be prepared for explanation of how the various sections of brain worked. Which is helpful and understanding the emotional response that immediately react to stress and how the cognitive rational brain can overcome and think through a stressful situation. This is an informative book for those who wish to understand how to deal with a survival situation from within."
4,Deep Survival,"This book is a must read for anyone who hikes or travels into the wild or beyond your own backyard. Gonzales tells a great story and helps you understand the risks when outside our civilized comfort zone. This is particularly important read for those who camp and hike and venture into the ""wild""."
4,Awesome. The Entertaining Psychology of Survivors,"Impressive, it exceeded expectations. I did not have great hopes of loving this book and had passed it by for years, even though the topic is right up my alley. Well, I was surprised to find this interesting, engrossing and remarkably fresh.I'd heard all the survival stories in the book before, but the author put a fresh spin on them and kept it suspenseful. The mix of survival stories, anecdotes and psychological discussion are well-balanced.I highly recommend this book."
5,risk,"Obviously I enjoyed deep survival; I bought copies for my son,a rock climber, and my son in law, a blue water sailor with my daughter and grandson aboard. More importantly one can generalise the concepts in the text to all things in life. The more we learn about neural function, the more we understand that intuition or ""feelings"" may guide us better in tough situations. Prepare, study but listen to the inner voice for a better chance of survival."
3,"good, not great.","Good, but not great. The book has some great stories, but I'm not sure I have a better understanding of why some people make it and some don't. He does a great job writing about survival stories, but his explanations of the science of all of this is not as tight as it could be. He's better with the Krakauer stuff than the Gladwell stuff."
5,Most Excellent,This book forever changed the way I look at the physical world. A must read for any adventurer.
1,"Blah, blah, blah","If you are doing a dissertation on the psychology of survival, this is the book for you. Unfortunately, I enjoy how people survive, and would rather get at the story itself, not whether the person has the brain synapses that promote survival. This book has very lengthy, adjective filled paragraphs (ex:""If you could see adreneline, then you'd see a great, green, greasy river of it oozing off the beach...""), lots of references to where he got his information, that could have been better footnoted, and long explanations of a particular psychological reason for a persons survival or demise. Again, dissertation-read this. Entertainment-pass."
2,So frustrating!,"I was terribly excited to read this book and was happily cruising through it until I came to the story about Tami Oldham. Having finished her book ""Red Sky in Mourning"" about two months before picking up Gonzalez' book the details were still quite fresh. He points to her actions as a clear example of what not to do to survive, conveniently ignoring that she did survive. His attitude towards her and his hero worship of any man that ever stepped foot in an aircraft made me wonder if there is a male survival experience that is more valuable or noble than a female survival experience? I don't think so; if you make it that should be enough...right?"
1,sounds hollow,"If you want not to get lost - pay attention.If you want to survive - stay cool.That's about it?This book irritated me somehow and I could not pinpoint why.Then I got an idea - it is as if a guy who never had sex interviewed a bunch of his friends and now is writing a book about it. I do not think the author has ever been in a realsurvival situation. (Even if he is a pilot and what not else.)The authors ego is all over the book which does not addvalue.I think I will stick with first hand accounts - ""Touching theVoid"", etc.This is just an opinion of course."
1,Couldnt get passed the first several chapters...,"I was hoping for a great book about stories of survival, what they did, lessons learned and who died, and why - Like the title says. This book, however doesn't even come close to what its advertising. The narrative is chaotic and the ideas somewhat obscure. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Deep Survival,"Totally overrated. Provides slightly more insight than basic common sense. Should have been left as a magazine article. Readers interested in this subject would be much better off reading some of the books ""reviewed"" in this book. i.e. Touching the Void and Albatros (great books)"
2,too much jargon,"This book is full of interesting information and tales of survival. Unfortunately, the author's ego keeps getting in the way of making it a good book. He includes an irrelevant chapter about motorcycle riding in Baja to tell us that he hangs out with celebrities. And the fascinating stories of survival involving aeronautics, mountaineering and rafting are so filled with jargon that if you don't participate in those activities yourself, you won't have a clue what he is describing. The Survivors' Club is a much better book about the same topic"
5,Deep Survival,"Excellent book, different from the beaten path. I could not put it down.I could relate from the experiences of panicking and letting your emotions out of control, it is deadly because in a survival situation you spend all your energy that way. I learned a lot on how humans behave, and what keeps you alive, and in the end what kicks in to help you until help comes!"
3,Every 8th word matters,"As stated in the text, the sun melted into the deep desert mountains, or some such nonsense. There are nice nuggets of wisdom here but you really have to want to find them. I would have stopped reading but I chose this one for the reading group so I was committed."
1,Difficult Reading,"If you enjoy stream-of-conciousness style of writing, then this book is for you. If you are looking for information organized in a logical format, don't bother. I found it irritating that the valuable 2 or 3 sentences of information were imbedded in lots of convoluted horn tooting of all his and his family's accomplishments. The only thing that forced me to keep reading was waiting for the author to get to the point about mind mapping, which he never did! I gladly passed this book on; it's not one that I would want to keep in my library."
1,Apparently I am in the minority,"I thought this book was VERY poorly written and primarily a pontification of the author""s very boring, ""oh and then I survived again aren't I amazing and wonderful, this little humble miracle that I am"" *accomplishments*. Personal perspective is certainly valid, but not to the degree that he took it. I would have prefered to have heard other people's stories. I am a RN, EMT, trained as a wilderness first responder,climber, skier, trekker,runner, horsewoman, former river guide and I do not underestimate the value of his information and the importance of sharing it, but his style of writing and his boasting just turned me off. I say borrow it from the library, don't waste your money by buying it."
4,Deep Impact,"When I started to listen to this book on Audio CD I had a lillte trouble grasping the content. I kept lisening and by the middle of disk 2 I couldn't stop I was hooked. Look deep into yourself and emerge the person you are underneath is what this book is about, at least to me it was. This book is an 8 disk set and will be played again in about another week while traveling."
2,Great Topic - not mjuch of a book,"This book is on such a fascinating topic and could have been such a wonderful read. But ultimately, it disappoints. The title is quite deceptive as this book is not ""Deep"" at all. It is at best a self-absorbed and scattered summary of some of the more popular recent survival tales interspersed with self-absorbed reflections and plenty of non-scientific doggerel about ""who lives, who dies, and why."" I found it to be poorly written, and most readers will be hard pressed to come away with any answers about ""who lives, who dies and why"""
3,Worth reading,"I found the book worth reading. The author does a nice job with providing scientific explanation of how the brain works in survival situations. He ties in some great real life examples with some relevant personal examples from his own life. On the down side, the book jumps around a lot and I felt that it was pretty fragmented in thought stream."
2,Pulp nonfiction,"This book is an easy, fast, enticing read, but ultimately unsatisfying, and even irritating at times. It's not clear if the goal was to write a thriller or an educational book couched in case studies, but the style is pedantic and repetetive. Maybe those two genres (thriller and educational) aren't mutually exclusive, and Gonzalez is bridging the gap, but I laughed quite a lot while reading because of the author's gotta-prove-something and I'm-so-extreme style. The book is a bit like an extended magazine article."
3,Interesting and informative,Gets down to the science of why we do the things we do. Most of the reading that captures you can be found in other books about the specific incident. Overall an interesting read.
3,mostly a story collection,"3.5 stars. The book could have gotten its essence through in an extended magazine piece, and that essence is good, with concrete examples of what went wrong for people and what were successful attributes for people who beat the odds and survived in very difficult circumstances. Some very impressive people in these stories, both those who prepared and those who were thrust completely unaware into life-threatening situations (e.g., a plane crash), and somehow found in themselves what they needed. You won't see this reviewer wandering through the wilderness, so I cannot speak from experience battling Mother Nature, but the advice and examples make sense and resonate with difficult times in general.I knocked the book down for its somewhat repetitive stringing together of stories, its detour into complexity theory, and more content than I cared for on the author himself and his father."
3,Survival of the fittest,"I am not sure why I had this book on my kindle - I dont think that anyone recommended it to me - I must have stumbled across it on Amazon.Anyway I found it very interesting - although the answer to the question in the title was not a simple one. The accounts of various disasters and survivors made for, what would otherwise have been a rather boring read,a gripping and fascinating narrative.I am not sure that having read the book I am any better prepared for survival in an extreme situation!"
1,Gave up after 50 pages.,"I wanted to like this book. I love adventure/survival books. The author, instead of telling a captivating story, mixed a bunch of physiological B.S into the mix which took away from the stories he was trying to tell. Want to read a compelling survival book? Go with ""Into This Air"" or ""The history of the Whaleship Essex"" or Endurance- Shackletons Journey."
2,Something off about this...,"I love natural disaster genre, but this book fell flat for me. Offering some Zen insights, and a few badly narrated but intriguing case studies, the author's voice kept intervening in strange and ultimately annoying ways, which is perhaps why I didn't really like the book: I found the author's voice annoying. Deep Survival is really more about Gonzales' father than surviving, per se, and he seems to have used the trope of survival to offer a meditation on his Dad's spectacular survival in WW2, which is fine is you want a father memoir, or a WW2 experience, but rather less so if you are more interested in case studies than Pater Gonzales or the author's own masculinist excesses, which were often annoying and badly narrated. In the end, this is memoir-cum-vanity autobiography. I was expecting something more interesting."
2,Not what I expected - Disappointed,"This is one of those rare cases when the average rating on Amazon truly let me down. I found the book choppy and had trouble understanding where the author was going at many points. The stories are truly remarkable, but much of the analysis misses the point - the point being ""Who lives, who dies, and why."""
2,Where was his editor?,"There is the potential for a great book hidden in this one. Unfortunately the authors ego hamstrings his own ability to bring it to fruition. A good editor coulda/shoulda done it for him. 60% of the book is the author's attempt to review the latest neuro- and other science explaining how our brains work when under extreme stress. 20% of the book is devoted to the completely superfluous stories of his own brushes with danger and palling around with famous buddies like Lyle Lovett and Lyle's Dad. That leaves 20% of book left for the meat - the real stories of real people in extreme situations. The science is interesting, but his attempts to synthesize wildly diverse fields is rambling, repetitious and often just boring."
1,Deep Survival = Shallow Survival Book,"There's nothing here that warrants reading: a bunch of anecdotes about 'survivors' (many of which come from common stories that we all know about) peppered with the author's ridiculous monday-morning quarterbacking. According to the author, any 'survivor' did everything right and every non-survivor did everything wrong. There is no coherent theory of what 'deep survival' is; just a bunch of illogical ramblings.Keywords for this book: junk-science, name-dropping, bragging, preaching, rambling, boasting, non-sensical.One last thing to mention is that there are way way too many quotations, like a bad 8th grade essay."
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited when I first started reading this book because the concept is so promising. I was expecting story after story of outdoor adventures gone bad along with an analysis of why the people did (or didn't) survive. Whatever this book is, it definitely isn't that.I gave up on this book after four chapters, so maybe it gets better later on, but the parts I read were very haphazardly put together. Accounts from real life survival stories are intermixed with the author's philosophy on survival physiology. In addition, the author often makes back references to small facts from earlier scenarios, which is very disrupting to the rhythm of the story.I would recommend reading the annual ""Accidents in North American Mountaineering"" series instead."
2,Daddy-worship and navel gazing,"This book should have been entitled ""My Daddy issues and how I AM SO just as much a man as he was."" Any actual insights into survival come from the facts of the anecdotes and case-studies, certainly not from the author's self-congratulatory pseudo-philosophy.In the end the question of the title - ""Who lives, who dies, and why"", never gets answered, and the appendix entitled ""The Rules of Adventure"" contains no insights that anyone with garden-variety common sense doesn't already know.I would not recommend this book for anyone interested in any real study of survival and survivors."
5,BEST BODY WASH; cleans well without drying out your skin...,"This is the favorite body wash of both myself and my husband. We like that it cleans well without drying out your skin. It goes on smooth and smells great, with a neutral scent that seems neither feminine nor masculine. We love that it has Shea Butter that moisturizes while you clean. Shea Butter is a plant-based emollient from the nuts of the Shea tree (Butyrospermum parkii) that mimics the lipid content of the skin making it easily absorbed by the skin thereby improving moisture retention. It is wonderful for dry and dehydrated skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth."
2,A come on to some serious cash outlays,"Bought the game as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, age 6... I discovered that it's really about buying and selling the checker-like tokens that retail for about $1.75 each in packs of 4 in the expansion kits, and you're buying them sight unseen! To collect all 125, expect to part with about $400 to account for all the duplicates you'll end up with and can't trade. Spend your money on something else unless Mattel drops the price and allows you to see what you're buying."
3,instructions for playing,"I bought the game in germany so it only has german instructions.I tried to understand how it works but if anyone can mail me the english instructions (pdf file, or anything else) it would be great!!rossella.rotondi@uniroma1.itTHANKS"
3,Casting Stone game,The Casting Stone Game would be great if more stones were available to buy - trading is fine but if we all have the starter game only - not a good deal. More stones to buy or no bother to play for this aging gamester.
3,Readable paperback PI novel,"This was supposed to be one of the best of the series. I saw it listed on some mystery sites as a must read for this genre.I liked it generally speaking and gave it an OK rating. It isn't a classic by any means but it has a good story, with good twists, believable characters, some action, good detective work. I dont' care for the authors frequent editorializing on issues that he deemed imporatant, but then again quite a few authors do this so I just accept it as their ""thing"".In all I found that it was a good, cheap, PI novel. That's what the guy wrote. Readable and I would recommend it if you want a quick, throwaway read."
3,Travis McGee's world is dreadful,"My first book by John MacDonald, this one ""the Dreadful Lemon Sky"" is listed as one of America's Best Detective stories.Travis McGee is a very tough man, with his own moral code. His world is a seamy one, filled with greedy, shallow people having low expectations of themselves in almost every sense you can think of - except for the lethal ones, who are caricatures of slimy vanity. Casual sex is typical and nonchalant in his world - every attractive woman is somebody's potential bed partner. Thankfully, not too many details are given. McGee's best friend (Meyer) is the philosopher/poet type, which says yet something else about McGee, contributing to his interesting descriptions of landscapes and illustrations of the human condition.I found Mr. MacDonald's story with its multiple violent arms to be depressing with nothing but McGee's friendship with Meyer to be uplifting. Not my cup of tea."
4,This Lemon is not Sour,"This was not one of the best McGee novels but it's still a good one. McGee goes off to investigate the death of a friend. The plot isn't really tied up in this novel but the strength of a MacDonald novel isn't always the plot but the writing, the characters, the flavor of Florida. This is full of McGee's and Meyer's insights into the human condition, which are always interesting to read. One of the bad guys comes to a particularly bad end. It's a unique and very uncomfortable way to die.Not a five star novel but four stars isn't bad,"
4,16 of 21: McGee at full stride,Found it in hard cover! Getting to know Travis McGee and Meyer can be a challenge. Little is revealed about the enigmatic hero in this tightly written novel. There are no significant revelations other than the possibility that McGee could be one-of-a-kind: a hound dog with high moral values. Comparison of McGee to Frederick Van Harn would be an excellent literary exercise.
3,disappointing,"I liked the game for its great graphics and the way you can decipher the coded messages, you can pick your characters most levels, and that it gives you a password for each level you finish. It has four game modes: forced side scroller, non-forced side scroller, shooter and sword fighting. In forced side scroller you keep running from an entity and can't stop, in non-forced side scroller (my favorite mode) you can maneuver yourself through the level, in shooter you just shoot and duck (boring), and in sword-fighting you can't even jump or anything (more boring). It was so much like the movie that it was like playing through the film! But it was boring and not very challenging---you can finish this game in a few hours. The levels just repeat themselves except that the backgrounds change and the controls are confusing because the game doesn't tell you what mode the upcoming level is, and the controls for each mode change. I expected the game to be much better than this."
5,"""...makes Saw look like a child's game.""","Spectacular! A must for horror/thriller fans. Just like the box reads, this one makes ""Saw"" look like a child's game. Definitely not for the squeamish...definitely not for the kiddies. Lena Bookall portrays a tortured and brainwashed kidnap victim that experiences so much physical and mental pain she resorts to anything to seek her freedom. This one is painful...gut-wrenching...a hidden gem that ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" fans will enjoy since it takes one step beyond the madness in those two films. Watch it late at night...in the dark...but don't dare to watch it alone. You'll need someone to hang onto. All 5 stars!"
1,Very soft metal,Dont buy these blades as they are cheap quality steel and don't hold up. Save your money and buy a heavy duty heat treated blade from another supplier.
3,Buy the Arnold instead,"The Arnold blades are way nicer. These look quite generic and don't have the sharpness. These aren't sharp at all actually. Probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference since I'm sure they still get the job done. They are made in the USA, like the Arnold. Just the Arnold blades are better."
1,Not recommended,I have owned a McLane edger for about 5 years now and have worn out the original edger blade and one replacement (after market) blade. I could not find another after market blade at the local stores so I ordered these blades from amazon. I must say that when these blades arrived I was very suprised at the quality. All three of these blades together are not as heavy as the after market blade I replaced. I installed one of the new blades and edged the walk as I normally do and I believe all three of the McLane blades will not last as long as one of the after market blades. I am very dissapointed with these OEM blades and will buy after market blades in the future. I would not recommend this product.
3,Not a Blade,"I am not sure if this is a blade since it has no sharpen edges. I bought 2 packs of this because it was a good price in comparison with the original bladesto be replaced with. I used a craftmans edger and this blade is suppose to be the same. The part itslf fits nicely with my craftsman edger. However, the cutting may be a question and the this metal piece tends to get shorten faster than the craftmans blade. Most likely, this is a softer steel. Overall, useable but if you can get a craftsman blade at equivalent price, get the craftsman."
4,Cold steel,Work as they should. The blades cut through anything. I do a great deal of linear footage and I wear through blades quickly but ai get fairly close to the concrete so that does not help there life. Happy with them.
3,early Bellrays,"This is the first album by the current Bellrays (their earlier 90's funk rock attempt doesn't count). It was very crudely recorded, live in their rehearsal space. This band really is one of the best live bands currently working, and has been for the past several years. Their albums have been getting better and better, as they seem to be improving as songwriters. Thus all of the subsequent albums are better than this one. But this one is still a rocking testament to what they were doing in the late 90s.Also, I don't know how the earlier reviewer got the idea that the Bellrays are from Detroit. They are from LA, CA."
4,Surprisingly addicting,"I was surprised at how addicting this book was. I wasn't necessarily expecting to enjoy a manga about racing, since I'm not into cars at all, but it hooked me right away! I went out and bought the next one as soon as I could. At first, I didn't like the drawing style, but it grew on me. This series is definitely worth a look!"
2,My lest favorite FF for the DS,"This is a tactics / real time battle based FF rpg for the DS. I much preferred the fantastic remake of FF IV and FF III, as well as the newer Four Heroes of Light. I found the learning curve to be too difficult on this title, and couldn't get into it. Admittingly, I have an aversion to real time battle RPG and prefer turn based strategy, so my bias is part of the reason I was disappointed. If you like real time battle and have patience, you may have a lot more fun than I did, but to classic RPG'ers, go for the FF III and especially IV, as well as heroes of light before this."
3,A Sequel Worth It? Yeah...,"I, being a huge fan of Final Fantasy XII, was skeptical when dealing with a DS sequel. A sprite based interpretation of XII's battle system and the lack of full, pre-rendered cutscenes was enough to stifle a bit of the interest, but the story is as engaging as it's PS2 predecessor and there are a few cutscenes at appropriate cruxes throughout. Ultimately if you're a fan of the characters and the overall lore surrounding the story, you're gonna love it, but if you loved the console atmosphere and the 3D visuals you may hate it. While not the best that could've been done, it is a worthy continuation to the story with some fun gameplay and likeable characters."
3,Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings,"It's a fun game,but it doesn't play like other Final Fantasy's.There is no turn based battle system.You can have so many espers join you that it makes the game too easy.You can't really buy weapon up grades,but you can craft new,stronger ones.You have to collect the ingredients in the field,during battle for crafting.The challenge you will get the most from will be trying to get high level espers to join you."
2,Completely Broken Combat,"I have to say that I only got a few hours into this game, and that the gameplay may improve later on, but the basic fundamentals are clumsy, unintuitive, childish, and, above all, lacking in any kind of strategy. It's like an RTS for 6 year olds; all you do is pump out disposable monster units, select your mob, and tap a spot near the enemy. If you want a real RPG get final fantasy III or IV; if you want a good strategy rpg get tactics ogre advance or FF tactics. Stay away from this, please."
2,Not quite like the PS2 FFXII,"Maybe it is my expectation-mismatch to blame, but this is not what I thought it would be. I loved FFXII on PS2, but this one is just too kiddo-ish, and instead of journeys and story modes you have individual ""fights"" or campaigns.The only way to level-up is to do side hunts and go back to already-fought campaigns and fight them again. Hmm. Not quite the same spirit of exploring a wide world. The whole gambit thing is overkill for this game. FFIII on DS Lite was better in terms of game play.Graphics- cutscenes are beautiful, in-game characters are laughable.The wait for FF13 on PS3 is simply too long. Before then, I will save my bucks for the FFVII Crisis Core on PSP, where the games are slightly more catered towards teens, not what feels like age 5 and up."
2,High Expectations,"After purchasing and beating Final Fantasy III, I was excited to finally buy this one. I figured the storyline would be along the same line as Final Fantasy III, but it was confusing and totally different. They constantly introduced new parts of the story, and even at the end of chapter 9, I have no idea why I'm still battling. The graphics are crap compared to Final Fantasy III. Square Enix should stick to designing the characters as 3-d chibis, not pixeley squares designed to look like characters. Also, the controls are whacked and the things ment to help you don't make sense at all. Overall, super research the next final fantasy game you plan on buying, because you never know what you're gonna get."
3,i don't get it....,"i could not get into this game...i was expecting more of a traditional FF game...this was more like tactics or something. should have done my homework i suppose...not my thing, would rate it lower but i suppose for what it is...it looks like it might be a good game.if you are looking for anything like a traditional FF type of RPG, this ain't it. I'm surprised so many people like it...."
1,"Should be ""Final Fantasy Tactics XII""","I thought that since the game only had the words ""Final Fantasy"" that it would be a traditional RPG from SquareEnix. Boy, was I wrong! Once again, SquareEnix strays from the traditional RPG path and creates something new that makes this game feel more like Final Fantasy Tactics. The cutscenes are amazing, but that's about it. If you want an action-oriented game that relies more on click-and-point instead of the traditional RPG style, then this game is for you. If not, you should look at another Final Fantasy title offered for the Nintendo DS."
1,Didn't like the game.,"My wife hated this type of game, with all of the killing. She played it for about 3 hours and then I sold it on eBay."
4,"Not what I expected, it grew on me","I was just aimlessly looking at a video game wall and noticed this new Final Fantasy. I loved most of the other ones and thought this would be good.OMG. This wasn't FF, this was a war game in FF clothing!I was so sorely disappointed, but then the story line kicks in and you get used to the battling. The game became quite fun.Now I think I may try one of those full blown computer war/magic games now that I can kinda play one. lol."
2,Why this game sucks.,"While overall this game is not bad, it is frustrating when the difficulty level suddenly increases to the point that you find yourself unable to progress. I finally made it to the Chaos battle and could not beat the duel bosses. I tried literally over a hundred times after leaving to level up to the point that I was repeating monster melees to gain levels. This is ultimately stupid and a waste of my time. On top of that the gameplay eventually does become monotonous (try failing at the same battle that many times and see what I mean) and the story that is told ultimately seems thrown together haphazardly. Overall a game to avoid as it's downfalls outweigh it's pluses."
2,Zzzzz...,"After three weeks of deep immersion in FF XII (the PS2 game), my expectations were probably too high for Revenant Wings. I suspended disbelief willingly at first, then with some effort, and finally not at all -- RW gets worse, over time. Like FF Tactics, this is a battle rattle for RTS boys, with a glut of sophomoric Japanese idealistic fantasizing about teamwork, plus a few cloyingly sweet short movies for FF's other demographic, infantile girls. But seriously folks, I have a real beef with the creators of this game: The gratuitous gory details about viera outcasts were peurile and underdramatized, to quote Wednesday Adams. With all the possibilities in that backstory, to just chop it off undeveloped was sad and very rude. It would have been better not to mention it at all."
1,disappointment,"I loved the older final fantasy games, and especially FF X and X-2 for the PS2, so I was super excited to see this one for the DS.Trying to play it though was beyond disappointing. My complaints:-story lacks depth and interest-strategy is too easy while mechanics of gameplay are too hard-not even fun-extremely overpriced for how terrible it is!Thinking it might be just me, I offered it to my husband and both my kids... They ALL flat rejected it after a short time of play, with the same or similar complaints to mine.Seriously, save your money and get a different game. Normally Square games are wonderful... I just don't know what happened with this one!!"
3,Solo para intelectuales,"Me apena decir esto despues de los buenos comentarios que se han dejado en esta pagina, pero la verdad que es un libro denso, sin trama, sin dialogos. El emperador Adriano habla en una especie de despedida, disertando sobre su vida y las cosas que ha aprendido. No niego que el libro esta bien escrito y que la autora debe de haberle puesto mucho empeño, pero por mas que lo intente, no logre engancharme. Lo recomiendo para aquellas personas mas bien intelectuales y que gustan de filosofar sobre diversos temas, pues si que es un libro profundo y con ideas muy lindas."
5,Hydroplane Racing at it's Finest,"As a personal friend of the authors and a former limited hydroplane driver, I can highly recommend this book. It you are a student of hydroplane racing, this is a must."
5,Museum Quality,"What a treasure trove this book is. I can't imagine how the author amassed this collection - it must have taken many years and a lot of money. It is overwhelming in its comprehensive survey of the various technical disciplines associated with espionage. A great service was done here, especially for the layman who only suspects that a lot of these devices exist. What a wonderful afternoon I spent going through it. Thanks Mr. Melton!"
4,Mostly History,"I found this book to be well organized and informative. It reads a lot like an encyclopedia, but without being in alphabetical order. There is quite a bit of duplication from one section to another, but it is all due to what I will call cross-referencing. Each subject is covered in two pages, which means a lot of graphics for short subjects. Longer ones end up with parts II and sometimes III. Always arranging subjects with these space limitations made we wonder what might be left out. My one real complaint is that it read more like a history, rather than an ultimate source. I realize that current information is only available in small amounts, if that, but it still would have been nice to have a section that discussed the topic as well as it could be. If my review sounds a little negative, I did give it four stars and enjoyed reading it."
3,PSP skins,The timing on this product was great. I didn't know though what kind of material the skin was. I expected it to be more flat. It still works though.
3,wind gauge for not too windy country.,We have extreme winds on a regular basis. This is not heavy duty enough and I can't stand out in the high winds to get a reading!
5,well-made product,"These rings are very sturdy and heavy. I was pleased with the quality. They were a bit larger than I anticipated. Also, the clips are behind the ""leaf"" so the there will be a small gap between the ring and the top of your curtain."
4,"Nice, but ...","I liked these, but they were a little bigger than I expected. For my kitchen windows they were too beefy. Would work well for larger/heavier items."
1,BROKEN TOY!!!!!!!!!!! AND MY PUPPY IS UPSET!!!!,"THIS TOY LOOKS BIGGER THAN WHAT IT REALLY IS ONCE RECEIVED...ALSO ONCE I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE AS ""STATED"" ITS SUPPOSE TO ""SQUEAK""!!! ONE FOOT DOES AND THATS IT!!!! MY PUPPY WAS DONE WITH THIS TOY IN ABOUT 1HR IF THAT!!!! BUT I GUESS AS THE SAYING GOES "" U GET WHAT U PAY FOR"" LOL I ORDERED PLENTY MORE OTHER TOYS FOR HIM IN THE PROCESS SO IT DIDNT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE JUST THOUGHT ID LET OTHER BUYERS KNOW"
3,Pebble people,"The toy is cute but make sure you check the size. I was so excited about finding a toy that it looked big enough in the picture i never checked size and if your like me and have a bigger dog this is just to small, i can put the whole thing in my hand, my dog would just swallow this whole but for a small dog im sure this would be a great toy."
2,Not What It Appears To Be...,"I purchased this book when I got my first pressure cooker, and I was unimpressed. First, the general discussion of pressure cooking isn't that detailed, but most of all, the title of the book is misleading - I thought that I was getting a book with ""general"" recipes - but the book is limited to just mediterranean recipes. The book cover does not reveal that the recipes are limited to such recipes, and I think that it should. Had I opened the book and paged through it, I would not have purchased this volume."
3,outdated material but good condition,"The book was in excellent condition, but the information in it was outdated. It was for the older type of pressure cookers and did not have many useful recipes."
3,More likely to try this book,"I have been seeking a few pressure cooking cookbooks that do not incorporate much meat. Also due to cooking for one, many of the recipes are just too large a quantity to prepare. I haven't dug through this one yet because I have purchased several lately, but when I peruse this one there is a greater chance that I will try some of the reipes. When I can get a good deal on a cookbook then I take the chance and order it. Sometimes they end up at our local library instead!"
4,Every man's nightmare,"Trench warfare can be difficult to say the least. Sometimes you have to let a few of your mates take a bullet for you. Sometimes, you might food have to put a bulletin them to get their rations and ammo. I think the author was a little hard on the guy."
5,The Best Endgame Book,"The best book to use to learn common practical endgames from simple examples.The format makes it easy to use without a board.Pandolfini covers the essential endgame knowledge to reach chess expert level with the minimum effort. It's what you need to know for over-the-board play with no extra fluff.Useful for beginners up to at least expert level. I'm a USCF Expert but still find this book useful. I just bought a copy for my nephew (11 years old; about USCF 1000 rating) -- some of the book will be beyond him right now, but not all of it.There are some minor typos and errors. As for the typos, you can search the internet to locate one of the online errata lists for this book. I give it 5 stars despite that due to Pandolfini's great selection and presentation of material."
3,A good reference on Endgame Positions.,Generaly speaking I don't like alegraic notation books writtensince the computer age got really going about 1980. This booksort of fits in that category but it could be considered by theold standards as a good mini-encyclopedia on chess endings.
3,Good book but far too many typos.,Pandolfini must have been in quite a rush to get this book finished. I would think that novices would have trouble with some positions because of these errors. Still it's a nice book to begin with and after this one graduate to Silman's book on essentials of endings. Silman's book is very valuable as is his Reassess Your Chess 3rd Ed. These Silman books are classics in my opinion.
5,Great for teaching children chess,I've been teaching my grand daughter chess by making up end games that she can win. This way she can become proficient with one piece at a time. I ran out of ideas for end games so I picked up this book. Its working wonderfully and I am learning a lot to.
2,Pass this one up,"On this surface, the pandolfini book looks good, but once you dig down, you discover all is not as it seems. The main problem, as I see it, is that it's a book of winning positions with titles like mate in 2 or mate in 3. Unfortunately, *that* is the easiest part of the endgame, and getting your opponent to that position is basically not covered.What it TRIES to do (and i think it fails here) is give you small pieces of the endgame puzzle as individual positions, and then piece them together. I just don't think this is effective, and would recommend something along the lines of Winning Chess Endings instead, which seems to take a more robust approach."
5,One of Pandolfini's finest works,No Hype! This is likely Bruce Pandolfini's best book. It does an excellent job of covering the most important basic endgames that an amateur needs to know. If you don't have an endgame book get it!
3,Gold necklace and chain,"Although my husband was very happy with this gift, I thought it looked a little fake. It's very shiny."
3,Dated. Needs updating.... oh wait!,"This is an old RPG by palladium books. We loved it back in the day. Recently we decided to give it another go and realized its too dated to play. Missing info, palladiums poor explanations of combat and abysmal character creation make it not worth the try. But then we found the updated version in the Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles RPG and the Robotech: Macross Saga Sourcebook. Amazing update: playable and functional books.Bottom line: This is a collectors piece. Period."
3,Fácil y entretenido,"El sistema de juego es muy fácil y entretenido, aunque no se presta para juegos más complicados (del punto de vista del suspenso en la acción). El sistema de Mega Damage, aunque tiene errores (o fallas) conceptuales, hace bastante rápido el cálculo del daño recibido. Es un libro y sistema de juego bastante bueno, si quieres acción, acción y más acción. Recomendable."
1,Bring me Kevin Siembieda's Head!,"As an avid Robotech junkie and a scholar of Dr. Lang himself, I must protest the horrible nature of this abomination of a RPG. Written in poor english and full of grammatical, technical, and historical inaccuracies, this book not only mocks everything that is Robotech, but also does it while never presenting anything nearing a fully functional role-playing system. The rules are half-done quick jobs, and trying to play the game proves my point, demonstrating how nearly impossibly unworkable the system is. Its only even nearly useful purpose would potentially be as a reference manual, but then again half the information inside the book is incorrect anyway.Oh, and Mr. Siembieda, HWR stands for Heavy War Robot, just like MBR is Main Battle Robot. *tch* Howitzer... What a doofus..."
5,great handheld portable phone,The dcx 700 replaced the original unit i purchased more than 10 yrs ago. I only use it outside my home and it can get some rough treatment and holds up well.
4,"good aditional unit, a little tinny",This product is as stated an additional handset for my phone system and works as well as the handset that originally came with my system. The only problem I have with the Uniden system in general is that some people I talk to say the unit is a little tinny.
4,It grabs you and holds you.,"Bednar has done a great job of capturing the flavor of the city of Erie and peopling it with a neat cast of characters. As well as fast-paced action, there are evocations of Erie history including a reference to the heroine's attempt to swim Lake Erie - a feat attempted years ago by an Erie resident.And yes, the chocolate chip cookies at Art's Market on West 26th are fantastic.A genuinely good read!"
3,So sad john....,"I have to say, I own ALL of john's books and I love them all, except this one. I teach 3-4 year olds and the tune of this book is very dry. kind of boring. I let my friend borrow it to present to her 5 year old children and still no interest from them. The pictures are wonderful, and the cd is ok to listen to while the children play, but they are not interested inrerading the book."
1,Barely a hint of truffle flavor - stay away.,"I bought these black truffle peelings from gourmetfoodstore and was really hoping to get the flavor of black truffles so that I could start making some amazing dishes at home. I bought a variety of different black truffles, truffle oil, truffle paste, etc - a total of about $200 worth.So far, I feel like I've wasted nearly all of my money. These peelings are practically tasteless and odorless, and if I was blindfolded, I'd think that they were just sliced mushrooms with very little flavor. I mean 'very little' - like NONE.If you want the taste of black truffles, keep looking elsewhere and splurge on the whole ones in the jars, so far that's the closest I've come - yet they're still very very subtle.Remember, 98% of all the worthwhile truffles harvested are kept by the harvesters or sold to exclusive buyers who usually represent expensive restaurants!"
4,Great Product Big Price,"This is the best face wash I have ever used! After 1 week I started to see results - cleaner, healthier looking skin. I have tried many of the cheaper products that you can find at the drug store but saw only minimal improvement if I was lucky. It's a lot of money to pay for face wash but you only need to use a tiny drop so in a way its worth it. One bottle lasts about a month or two for 2 people."
4,"A simple, but heart-wrenching book","As a child I read this book. I read it again. I remembered the poignant moments of this novel. Lovejoy's heartbreak over the destruction of her garden, her intense loneliness and desperation when she learns her mother has left her, Olivia's pain when she realizes she cannot live to belong to someone. Godden writes of the gritty streets of London in the post-war years. Her story of Lovejoy, Tip and Sparkey fighting against the brutal realities of survival to create something beautiful ins both inspiring and charming.Overall stands the statue of the Virgin disturbing and consoling the efforts of the girl who tries to keep things clean and pretty.The characters of this story, the Chesneys, Mrs Combie and her husband Vincent, Father Lambert and Charles and Liz give flesh and spirit to the bleakness of a world trying to rise from ashes, with hope, tarnished and torn, but insistent."
5,The Episode of Sparrows,"Lovely book, good story. All ages can enjoy this tale. Prompt delivery, too.Treat your family at the holidays with this lovely tale."
5,great buy,"The shampoo and conditioner are real nice. I also like that it came with a lot of soaps. I wish I could understand Japanese because I have sensitive skin and I bought it because it is ""mild"" but I do wonder what the ingredients are."
4,A little too big for decking.,"Yeah, they are too big for decking but i think they would work on a plant stand."
5,One of the best films ever,"Having watched many movies in my lifetime, I have come across few as good as ""Overcome"". This story of a high school bully (modern day Saul) who transforms into a loving, caring, person (modern day Paul). What a story of redemption. This movie will touch your soul, especially good for a teenager."
5,Great Movie,Seeing a teenage prospective of how to come back to Christ is amazing. Hopefully this is still around when my child gets to be a teen.
3,could have been better,the movie was ok. i thought it would have been better judging by another movie done by this company.(Bell & the Beast) they had a trailer for Overcome and it looked pretty good. It just wasn't as good as i thought it could be. If you are looking for a good christian movie to teach your kids this would be a good one.
3,High-school acting,"Gave it a 3 because of the Truth expressed in the story-line. Otherwise, hate to say it, but I found it very boring. Maybe after viewing such excellent Christian films like Courageous and others, this just didn't hold my attention. Recommend it for young folks probably any age."
4,Pretty good,It was only a little corny because the young male actor wasn't incredible. It had a great message and no smut...although some alcohol use by teens...but it was needed to encourage the message. Great movie emphasizing standing up to your peers in order to follow the right path!
1,This book fails to deliver the intended message.,"This book is a failure, the author is so worried about trying to make other people think she's super intelligent, that she fails to deliver the intended message. I'm all for feminism, but after watching my GF who speaks English as a second language (Korean as her first), the large number of ridiculous and very hard to understand descriptions using pointless grammar ruin the book. If the author had truly cared about informing the reader about feminism and less about trying to seem like a super genius with her 25 pounds over overly complicated descriptions in a 5 pound description bag, she would have likely succeeded.This book was a disappointment and frustrating read, there are much better books out there on the market."
1,Tries to pass opinion as fact,"Bell Hook's book is a poor attempt to try and pass her opinion as fact. She tries to make the case that feminism is for everyone by stating broad generalities that are not backed up by any form of statistics or research. Also, there are many typo errors throughout the book that is just unprofessional. Her book is more of a gripe against white men, her current view of feminism, and the glorification of the working class rather than actually explaining what feminism is about. I would not recomend her book to anyone because she poorly attempts to pass her opinion as fact. Ms. Hooks should seriously reconsider how she deveolps her arguments and doing some research on her broad generalizing statements before she publishes her next book."
4,Move to this,"Bell hooks's book is an excellent introduction to the study of feminist politics. With clear and concise language, she revisits the beginnings of the movement, and tells us where it is now. She also succintly explains why feminism is not anti-male, anti-sex, or anti-family, but rather feminism is the struggle against rigid sexism in patriarchal cultures. Despite its plague of editorial errors, the book is highly recommended for the non-academic language and for the encouraging message hooks offers us."
3,Nothing like what it claims to be -- pretty much the complete opposite,"I got ""Feminism is for Everybody"" thinking that would be a good introduction to bell hooks' writing, but I was disappointed.I liked the way she thought, but not the way she wrote. Her refusal to use commas made it hard to read.It was also frustrating that the book clearly wasn't what it purported to be: an introduction to feminism that you could just hand to anybody who's curious about feminism but doesn't know anything about it. It seemed to me to be a disjointed collection of outdated essays written for existing feminists about reform needed within the world of feminism.There was almost nothing there that seemed relevant to someone curious about feminism in the 2000's. These articles were probably awesome in the 60's, if you were a feminist wanting to reform you movement."
4,A Must Have,"Im a young feminist and I adore bell hooks. Before reading hooks I was only familiar with one opinion of feminism: the white, upper-middle class, waspy side. Im totally digging reading another side of the story. Hooks' language is accessible but her ideas are complex. She tackles topics that I other authors overlook. By not limiting the scope of the discussion to body image, rape, and compulsory pregnancy, hooks starts a whole new conversation. The intersection of class, race, and gender has never been dissected more beautifully. Love it."
3,"Good, but where is the plan?","I adore bell hooks. I've read all of her. This book is one of the most troubling though. She seems to think of many men as victims, like when she says that most men do not want to be patriachs. In each chapter, she basically tells everyone what is wrong with current feminism and that it should be changed. What she fails to do is to tell us how feminism CAN be changed. What does one do to change feminism? She gives some ideas, like feminist schools and television networks/programs, but these are highly unrealistic and most individual feminists cannot do this; and people who are not feminists really won't do it. The book fails to give real every day alternatives and that is its main downfall. She should have told us what feminism can offer and HOW it offers that."
2,Learn how to use commas!,"This isn't a full review rather just a comment on the readability of the text. I don't know if this book was unedited or what, but it is very difficult to read. Perhaps there is a thumb tack on Bell Hook's comma key, as she is very reluctant to use it. Example:""Despite the economic gains of individual feminist women, many women who have amassed wealth or the contribution of wealthy males, who are our allies in struggle we have created no schools founded on feminist principles for girls and boys, for men and women.""This is just one out of hundreds of hard to comprehend sentences throughout ""Feminism is for Everyone."" There are also run on sentences, sentences that start with ""And"" and a large amount of incomplete sentences. Perhaps Bell Hooks thinks that proper English writing rules were made up by men and that she is expressing individuality by flouting them. Whatever the reason, it makes the grammar nazi inside me die a little every time I open the book."
2,Feminism Is For Everybody except.........,"As a life long feminist, I have always espoused that feminism is about inclusion. This book opposes that belief. The title would lead one to beleive that Ms. Hooks feels the movement of feminism should include people from all walks of life.That is not what you will discover. She refers to our feminist pioneers as ""priveledged, educated white woman"", and feels fit to use the term ""housewives"" throughout her book to describe woman(mothers) who do not work outside of the home.I haven't heard anyone use that term seriously for a couple of decades. Apparently these two categories of women are not fit to wear the ""feminist"" label.The background she provides for the early days of the feminist movement is educational for someone new to the movement. But, when all is said and done, she is a fringe feminist and one needs to understand that before reading this book. I found it somewhat difficult getting through this book with the numerous editorial errors!"
5,MUST READ,"LOVE this book! It's a great introduction to feminism and how sexism affects various aspects of daily life. I recommend and share this book with anyone who asks me about feminism. It's a pretty quick, informative read, without using academic jargon, anyone can relate. Anything by bell hooks is great though."
4,GREAT REFERENCE BOOK!,"Even though this book is limited to a particular group of Depression Era kitchen shakers (milk glass with lithographs and I am biased to these!!), it is an EXCELLENT reference guide for those of you who collect them! And if you do collect them, the check-off boxes are a handy item. GREAT SIZE for taking to those flea markets and auctions to see what you need to have! The prices listed are a good start to bargain with! BEAUTIFUL color photos of the shakers. It sits on my coffee table! Thanks, Barbara!"
3,Depression Era Shakers,"This is a very good book for information and has very clear pictures of the different items, just wish it was a little longer."
1,Montessori in the Classroom: A Teacher's Account of How Children Really Learn,This is a must read for every teacher of young children! Paula Polk Lillard is right on target on her observations of children and how the teacher can assist them be the best they can be!
1,disappointed,"disappointed! they list a 5 day strategy for literacy, but no further details. i was hoping for a few tips on how to start a book club, but it was basically a bunch of jargon. don't waste your money."
4,Good Hard Sci-Fi.,"A Hard Sci-fi book, Yet it was a good story, kapp was able to keep you interested despite the deep predictive chaos theory. The story is about aliens that are attacking our worlds through the science of chaos theory which is like predicting results. They know all the moves we will make... A man named Bron is a wild card, he makes the most illogical choices that throw a monkey wrench into their fool proof plans."
5,Up to Snuff,"A very solid anthology of Ellison's work. Stories are suffused with an inner light that seems to burn brighter as Ellison approaches his own death. Eillison's work, as a whole, is, I find, very uneven, but this one's got quite a few goodies. He has gotten better with age. A lot better. I just wish he'd write more."
5,Ellison's anger is sweet to the tooth.,"Ellison's brilliance is unmatched. Period. Anyone who tries to tell you differently should be doubted and/or excommunicated. He lives for The Truth, and whether he has found it or not, he pursues it relentlessly. The stories in Angry Candy are a philosophical as they are touching, and they are guaranteed to deliver the pure fire of Ellison's work. The Region Between is an excellent example of Ellison in top form, as is The Paladin of the Lost Hour. These two stories alone are worth the price of the book, but the others are no slouch either. Read it and be amazed"
2,Overrated,"A collection of unequal short stories. I enjoyed Guardian and Werewolf. As for the other stories, only expectations that the next story would be better kept me reading them. That collection is a disappointment to me because the death concern generally is an inspiring theme. Not so this time."
2,Not great by any means.,"I'll grudgingly give this book 2 stars. This whole ""on-the-edge"", ""experimental"" story format has GOT to go. It may have been cool when he was doing it way back when, but now it just seems like he's aping himself. Come back Harlan, I know you're in there somewhere."
1,Poor quality,We purchased this item based on the reputation Nautica has for producing high quality products. The material on the top of the comforter is very flimsy & tears easily. In the first week the comforter tore while simply making the bed. It has since torn twice more.
1,Not a Good Buy,"I bought this comforter for my son, and I immediately returned it! It looks so cute in the picture, but the comforter is horrible quality. The fabric is knit-like, so the batting underneath comes through the fabric so the comforter never looks clean. The material under the fabric (batting) is pillow-like, not something you would expect in a comforter. I could see it not wearing well with active kids. Do not buy this comforter, way too much money for the quality. For the same price you could go to Pottery Barn Kids and get a high quality quilt!!"
4,"soft & cuddly, not rough & tumble","I have purchased this set for my son for our new house so it is still in the package unused, however I've inspected it and though it is SO soft and SO warm and my son says he can't wait until it's on his bed I can tell it's somewhat fragile. Imagine your own soft cotton pique polo shirt as a comforter covering. Same fabric. It will rip if something sharp or pointy hangs on it. The underside is a different material - a solid red sheet-like fabric. It is still VERY eye-catching and sporty."
4,"Very interesting stories, well-written","I got this for my 8-yr-old son, but ended up reading it myself. I think I will read them with him, as some of the concepts may be over his head. It is still interesting for the stories alone, I'd just like him to really get some math education out of it. Not difficult to grasp for older children who are already introduced to algebra, geometry, etc.This isn't the type of book you'll want to read all at once. Each story about an individual has different lessons, different concepts, that you'll want to discuss after reading. Great for home-schoolers or parents wanting to enrich their child's education.Very happy with the book, now I've got to get Volume 1."
5,Great at preparing for preschool,We got this for my two year old who will be starting preschool in about a month. He loved this book and is so excited about going to preschool. He has to pack his backpack and a pretend lunch every morning then he carries his backpack around all day! It answers all the questions kids might have about preschool and it doesn't talk about being scared of going to school which most books do and we don't want him to expect to be scared so this book is perfect!
3,What to expect at preschool explains what the child will be doing at preschool.,"This book is good but a little long per page. Being a preschool teacher I look for fewer words per page and bright pictures. It had the pictures, just too many words. It did tell the children what they would be doing in preschool."
2,Too Wordy For Kids,"My son loves listening to me read, and can sit still for long books. But this book was over the top, I am not sure that any young child would be interested in listening to this book. My son lost interest on the very first page.However, I went through the book again and used my own words to go with the pictures and he enjoyed it.Overall, I wish I had not ordered this book. I should have listened to the other reviews."
2,too wordy for a preschooler,"I bought this book for my reluctant preschooler and it's far too wordy to keep his attention. I would buy ""I love school"" before buying this book."
2,"Not a ""story""","This book is not a ""story"" about preschool, it is more of a question and answer... providing definitions. For example, what is a teacher? Not something my son was interested in.... he much prefers stories about going to preschool."
5,Captivating...without a doubt Wonderful cd even better live,I have enjoyed this cd for two years. Now Im hearing rumors about there being a west coast tour that would be so cool
2,Plink...plonk...kerrrrannnggg!,"The above title sums up much of this release from the usually interesting Schleiermacher. Most of the pieces are beyond dissonant, messy, pointless and meandering. To make things worse, toy pianos are used on several tracks alongside a somewhat misplaced notion of what music actually is. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the avant-garde and/or experimental, but really, come now...Recommended for therapists and the vengeful."
4,"Good, but make sure you watch Cocaine Cowboys I first","This is a follow up the first Cocaine Cowboys. Griselda Blanco 'The Godmother' was a very popular figure in the first movie and people wanted to know more about her. The sequel covers Charles Cosby's relationship with the Godmother and goes into her bio a bit. Although the documentary is good, it is not as good as the first Cocaine Cowboys. I was expecting to learn more than I already knew but I didn't. It's still worth watching, especially if you want to know more about Griselda Blanco. As always with Billy Corben movies, make sure you go through all the extras on the DVD and watch again with the commentary on."
2,What can I say about sequels that hasn't already been said?,"sequels usually suck and ""Hustlin' with the god mother"" happens to be a perfect example of a producers desperate attempt to make a few extra dollars.This feature sadly does not compare with the first part, what I saw is one drug dealer telling his story, how he wrote the God mother while she was in prison , how she fell in love with him because she thought he "" was special"" lol, how she helped him make a lot more money than he ever dreamed of making and how he got lucky and lived to tell his story , what a boring character.I wouldn't have watched the entire feature if it wasn't this for Jorge ""Rivi"" Ayala, he is the only entertaining character here.On a final note, This is not a documentary , its just a bunch of guys talking..."
3,"Decent, but nowhere near the original....","Three and a half stars for this. If ""Cocaine Cowboys"" was the Vice City of true crime, then this is the San Andreas, as we head to the west coast in the early 1990's. Hard to top the original (probably the best true crime docu ever made), but still good."
5,Better than the first,"A Great true story. I have watched this movie over and over. Everyone who watches it has their eyes glued to the screen. It's the only sequel I saw that you didn't have to see the first one to follow part 2.The godmother is the real scarface. I liked how the movie showed her dangerous cut throat side. As well as her softer side, how she loved her children and charles cosby. This is the best documentary I have ever seen. I liked the music in the movie especially the theme song real scarface by ncredable. I hope they make a video for it that would be cool! I found the whole song at myspace.com/ncredable"
1,"A lame, embellished rap video....","This movie fails in many ways but here are main ones1)Its not Cocaine Cowboys. Its tries soooo hard to be like the first movie that it falls flat on its face.2)Charles Cosby. Charles who? you may ask. the main character is unlikable and quite frankly not believable.3)The story itself. I am sure there are parts that are real but I would venture to say alot of this junk is made up.One the whole: unlike the first captivating movie this ""sequel"" is just a badly made rap video. There alot of segues that are blantant ripoffs of other movies-like the part Charles tells us the ""art"" of making crack--Cmon that almost right out of Menace to Society."
2,Good RCA Compilation (not Sony artists or other labels),"Aunque faltan incluir MUCHISIMAS bandas buenas i.e: Soda Stereo, Patricio Rey y Sus Redonditos de Ricota, Seru Giran, Los Caballeros de la Quema, La Renga, Rata Blanca, Ratones Paranoicos, Sumo, Attaque 77, Spinetta y los Socios del Desierto, Babasonicos ...etc, etc. es un buen compilado de bandas Latinoamaricanas del sello RCA solamente.En definitiva: Bueno; pero NO COMPLETO. Se debería agregar la compra del CD ""Rock Nacional: Obras Cumbres [IMPORT]"" (o los CDs de esas bandas).Vale la pena conocerlas.P.S: otro muy buen compilado de Rock en Español es el CD doble ""30 Años de Rock Nacional"" Vol. 1 y Vol. 2. En total 4 CDs (cada uno trae 2 discos) pero en Amazon.com no se vende, al menos hasta el momento)."
2,Publisher's mistake,"The most irksome thing about the paperback edition of this book is that the photographs included are nothing more than poor quality photocopies. Come on. An inexpensive edition is one thing, but in this case skimping on the basics makes for a huge mistake."
4,Wrong Item Quickly Corrected,"Ordered the Gimli LotR Axe and instead got a terrible looking executioners axe! What was sent consists of painted 1/2 inch PVC pipe that's about five feet long and a double-axe that must be attached. The axe's ""blade"" is painted silver and the paint started chipping almost immediately. Not satisfied in any stretch of the imagination.EDIT: Shipper quickly corrected error and sent the correct item. They even let me keep the wrong axe. Huge improvement in rating based solely on good customer care and quick responses. Item was exactly as described."
2,Not bad. Not good either.,"This is actually 2 books in one. The synopsis is listed elsewhere, I'll skip that.The first book is complete and fairly interesting.The second book is a cliff hanger and you will need to get the next book (the stars at war II) to know the end of the story.Honor Harrington series is much better. If you are a video game / space opera fan, you may like this book. If not, I'd recommend passing. If you can't get enough of the fleet action sequences in Honor Harrington, then you may like this book.For a First Contact book with much less (but enough!) combat sequences, I HIGHLY recommend ""Enders Game"" instead.Ender's Game (The Ender Saga)"
1,Disappointed,"I find it amazing what publishers will do to sell books! I bought this book believing it was another addition in the series, but I find out that it is a combination of two previous novels (Crusade & In Death Ground) in the series! I originally believed the series was very enjoyable, but after the last fiasco I believe it will strongly leave a doubt in my mind on continuing reading the series."
3,disappointed,"I pre-ordered this book thinking it was a continuation of the series; it's not! this is the novels 'Crusade' and 'In Death Ground' combined into one hardback book. Now it's nice to have these novels in hardback form and I probably would have bought it just to replace the old paperback copies, but there's no reason for this book not to be listed for what it is."
5,"something old, something new","if you are not familiar with the work of the great american humorist, s. j. perelman, it's old news to the literati, but it can be a surprisingly pleasant new experience for those who are not..."
5,This is the ULTIMATE cookbook!,"I am Italian & I love this cookbook, I use it all the time. I entertain clients so I am always using this cookbook in particular. All of the recipes are GREAT! I also have the recipes on my blog."
3,Good Story but Full of Inaccuracies,"First of all, the term ""Majesty"" was not used until Henry VIII styled himself as such a couple of centuries later. There are many other details which are inaccurate and for the avid reader of Historical Novels, (NOT historical romances) it was sometimes difficult to get past them to enjoy the story. This author was not as thorough on her research as she should have been. Two authors who ARE who I love and I have read nearly everything they've written are Margaret George and Sharon Kay Penman.As a descendant of Edward I, Edward II and Edward III, I am particularly interested in historical fiction from this time period. The author should be aware that unlike historical romances, the readers of historical novels DO know their history."
3,"Out of date, but...","This book mentions nothing about the Internet or file trading. However, it does have some good advice if you are playing clubs. I go back and forth on this book. I loved it six years ago when it came out. This is 2002 though. We need an update!! I recommend it to those who play out a lot, but don't get it if you just hang out online or don't play on a regular basis."
3,Good Basic Primer &Business Plan,"The book is relatively short and thus, technically-speaking, overpriced. However, it is very useful for anyone releasing their first record. It's very easy to understand and very practical. It provides a very basic business plan for the typical performing musician. Artists who do not plan to support their CD by extensive performing may find it less useful, however."
5,It works,"Plain and simple. I have used the book for 3 years and I have sold over 17,000 CDs and 4,000 cassettes. Judge a book about what it does for you. Not the words of people who don't want to do the work and will critize anything because they are lazy.Take it from someone who didn't even sell 200 copies of his first CD until he used this book!"
5,Absolutely Essential,"Having purchased and read this book AFTER my last band unsuccessfully self-released a CD, I can only hope that others will read this before attempting a self-release.Over the past 3-4 years I have read almost every title I could track down on releasing an independent recording, but NONE come close to Sweeny's book. The information presented here is absolutely essential to anyone even thinking about going it alone. Sweeny's writing style is informal and easy-to-follow, getting straight to the need-to-know info.Having been through the self-release grinder without benefit of this wisdom, it amazes me that all other books don't present this straight-up ""horse sense"". Don't release a CD before reading this book and absorbing what Tim tells you!"
4,"I would have given 5 stars, but it's a little outdated...","The best book of it's kind.A little expensive, but the information is priceless.A good, fast, condensed read- full of exactly what I needed to know when I needed to know it.Bottom line:Look for it used."
2,Adquate If you ONLY wish to speak not read Hangul!,"I did not know when ordering this book it was ROMANIZED or I would have never purchased it! Due to the price vs the cost of shipping its not worth my time or money to send back.AMAZON.COM should list in the short description the book is romanized not written in Hangul! I tried contacting the author at the university the book claims he is a professor at, he is not on staff there(8/99). The book was written in 1988."
3,great idea -- bad implementation,"I'm giving the doorstop three stars because it is a bangup idea. There are practically no english to korean resources on the market and to have a resource like this next to my dictionary would be great. The blows at Yonsei sure dont have a clue about good resources. (I recommend Ganada in Hongik dae [¡'Ù Ñ¿; ¿ ÀÌ'Ù!]) To Mr. Song: please do it again, sir, in hangul. Once is never enough from a man like you.To you money hungry publishing executives out there: I know there is a huge market out there for good and easy to use resources for learners of korean from english. Kyopos everywhere! And parents who want them to speak korean....get it? You're killing us with stuff the other way; you're also killing us with resources for Japanese and Chinese; what about some help for those of us who want to speak the korean language!So please kyosunim, help us with better resources for learning korean. I'll buy the first one...."
1,This book is problematic,"Like the other reviewer, I was disappointed by the lack of Hangul characters. In romanizing the Korean verbs, the author makes the book virtually impossible to use. The effort of converting the romanized syllables back into pure Korean is not worth the effort. However, if the author came out with a Hangul edition, I'd buy it in a minute!"
3,better than nothing...,"I've done the spanish, english, and italian versions of this book, all excellent,..this korean verb book,..however,..hmm,..first of all, I wonder why they only present 200 verbs? pretty skimpy. also, I'd find this much more useful, as a student of korean, if they'd have used both the romanization AND the hangul alphabet. other than that, I am finding it useful..and frustrating. I'd give anything if they'd rewrite this book in the korean alphabet."
3,"OK, but a little dry","I had high hopes for these, but they left me a little dry. The taste is ok, but they are not moist at all -- make sure you have a big drink to go with it!"
3,"Good idea, uneven quality","I bought several of these transformers for my 6-year-old son, who is crazy about Star Wars. He loves them, but they vary in quality -- the Obi-Wan and Anakin transformers are sturdy, but General Grievous has many parts which come off easily, and parts of Luke Skywalker broke within a day. The Darth Vader transformer has held up well (my 2-year old has one of those too, and it has stood up to his handling) but it also has pieces which sometimes are hard to attach well. Still, my son loves these toys and even plays with the broken Luke transformer, though not as much as the others. My advice: buy Anakin or Obi-Wan but think twice about Luke and General Grievous."
2,Breaks easily,"My son was so excited to get this for his birthday. He was devastated when the leg broke off after rather gentle play within about 30min. We contacted Hasbro and they were very good about sending us a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement's leg broke in the same place after about 5 minutes and my son was being very careful not to break it. It just isn't a sturdy toy. We also have Anakin, Darth Maul, and Obi Wan and so far, none have broken."
4,Gorilla Games Help Keep Us Gorilla's on Our Toes,"This book is a good gift for your friends and relatives who invest but don't really know much about what they are doing. The advice, logic, and approach, while conservative, is way too dull and boring for the likes of me. Nevertheless, I believe a less experienced investor would get a lot of information and control from an informed reading of The Gorilla Game."
5,Outstanding book for the serious amateur high tech investor.,Practical guide to serious amateur investing in high technology companies. Relates investment thesis to the author's earlier books on high technology marketing. Useful both from an investing viewpoint and as a guide to value creation for managers of high technology companies.
4,"Conceptually good, practical maybe.","Provides a good framework for identifying upstarts that may become gorillas. Whether these concepts can be translated to profits remains to be seen. I seen too many strategies that look good on paper but fizzle out in practice. Nevertheless, the book is valualbe in making understandable how gorillas get to be that way."
3,Gorilla Game Review,"The book is very rare to find. The state of the book is not the best (e.g. the coverage has some glue on top).Regards,Andrea"
3,An Eye-Opener for Everyone,"The book does a pretty good job demystifying high-tech industries, particularly from a competitive strategy point of view. This is a must read for at least three kinds of people: amature investors, high-tech investors who concentrate solely on financial statements (but know nothing about Michael Porter), and value investors who pick low pe stocks. This is an eye-opener particularly for traditional value investors: gorillas usually have the highest pe (or p/sales) of the industry, and yet they are the winners. The book is a little too long. The idea can be explained clearly and thoroughly in the equivalant of a journal article. Many of the materials are sugar-coated for unsophisticated investors. I think the book is overrated, but deserves a careful read."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"This book flat out sucks. It does not give you any solid, fact proven advice on buying the correct big winners in the stock market. I owned this book back in 1999. I am glad I did not keep it. The one thing that sticks out in my mind is the book telling us Apple was not a good stock and was not worth buying. Apple went from $14 per share back in 2004 all the way up to over $500 per share in 2012. The best investment book you can buy is William O'Neil's ""How to make money in stocks"". William O'Neil has made over a billion dollars in the stock market. I wonder how much the clowns that wrote this book have made. If I want to learn how to score the big winners, I'd rather learn from the best."
3,"Good, but need more",The information in the book is as far as it goes. But it would have made more sense to include stuff on trading online - which meant I also bought Trading Online (FT Pitman 1999) by Patel which was a brilliant companion to this book.
1,The famous book,"Unless you are an insider. Look for companies with large capital who will eventually control the market by a sequence of aquisitions, example is CISCO. Currently JDSU took the fiber optics market by buying out competition . Then who will take the wireless. hardly any inovation here. For a book that mention inovation a 1000 times."
3,Garden flag,"I didn't care for the fabric this flag was made of. After hanging on my flag holder for three weeks, the points on the star were still bent. The colors were not like the picture represented. It was not the best sewn flag I have ever purchased either. I will probably donate it to the thrift shop for resale."
3,Summer time flag,"The quality is good and the design is appropriate for more than one season, but it turned out to be a little small for my yard,"
3,Prevents Puncture Flats,"These are good for preventing flats caused by burr's and small tacks. They do add a little weight to the tire, but I'd rather not have to keep repairing flats than ride on a lighter tire.I ordered these to replace the ones that I had previously which wore out. I suspected that a crack in the strip was causing tube flats, so I wanted new ones. Unfortunately the one's I recieved looked to be remanufactured. However, they did seem to work ok. When I need to order them again, I'll probably get them from another source."
5,good to have,Use to have my MT bike punctured by blackberry thorns. I had not a single flat tire since I put these in. I also the equivalent ones for road bike.
2,"Decent for casual reading, but a disaster as a college textbook","This book can deliver at ease if you consider it as a casual read, a source that provide a glimpse at the movie business and its history. But it fails miserably as a college textbook. The materials are presented in a fairly disorganized manner and I believe the absence of chapter summaries bring inconvenience aplenty for students when doing revisions. Some may think otherwise, but imho I do not believe a textbook without chapter summaries and a thorough glossary (this book fails in this area as well when I realize they've included very few terms in the latter chapters) is the right tool to be used in academic environment."
2,Honest,The book was written in quite a bit and the corners were turned. But I was told the condition of the book before purchase. I appreciat the honesty.Mary
5,"An excellent, if outdated overview of animal rights agendae","Although this book was published in the early nineties, the information and history in this book serve to expose an ugly, destructive underbelly of the warm and fuzzy feel-good message of the animal rights movement. In the ten-plus years since this book was written, evidence has come into public view regarding animal rights extremist groups killing huge numbers of healthy dogs and importing unhealthy dogs into the country, the latter of which has exposed our pets to new and deadly strains of rabies, and more. I give it five stars for being innovative, but I would like to see this book revised and updated with information for readers who want to do more for our pets than read a book."
5,The Hijacking of the Humane Movement,"This book is well written and very informative. It is also frightening in its content because it describes how PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has a political agenda which, if not stopped, will lead to our NOT being allowed to have pets. The information makes a good background for reporting any stories submitted by PETA, HSUS (Humane Society of the U.S.), Doris Day Animal League, and other animal rights groups. The book makes a very clear distinction between animal welfare and animal rights. Should be required reading!"
5,Taking Animal Rights Extremists seriously,"The Hijacking of the Humane Movement puts a new, detailed, well-documented spin on animal extremists, their history, goals, and overall agenda. Rod and Patti Strand end their book with a quote from a letter member of the American research community:""Passivity sets up people to give into their fears, to become victims....We know that in the animal kingdom, when an animal is faced with a predator, the worse thing an animal can do is freeze. The best thing an animal can do is is scream...and adopt an aggressive posture."" The Strands are correct when they say ""It turns out you truly can't give an animal rights without first taking them away from people. Joe Arnette, Sporting Clays May 199"
1,Industry sponsored rhetoric,"I have not read this book. I don't need to- as an animal rights advocate I deal with this crap on a daily basis.Soooo, in the interests of full disclosure: according to SourceWatch, author Patti Strand is the national director and primary spokesperson for an organization called the National Animal Interest Alliance, which is a front group and industry funded lobbying group for animal commerce and agriculture, whose agenda supports hunting, animal agri-business, animal testing, commercial breeding, animal entertainment (circuses, rodeos, etc.), horse slaughter, fur ranching...well you get the picture. Clearly this book is simply industry rhetoric designed to undermine efforts of activists and organizations that are in support of the humane treatment of animals."
2,"Bizarre, and unintentionally humourous","Although written in a more educated style than many other anti-animal rights books published by small presses, The Hijacking of the Humane Movement shares a bizarre distortion on the goals and practices of animal rights activists.Among the tiresome anti-animal rights myths promoted are: animal rightists want to eliminate all contact between humans and other animals,animal rightists are in it for the money, and Nazism is representative of the ""true"" animal rights philosophy (Chapter 3 is entitled ""Nazi Germany: A Distortion of the Movement""). If anything in this book is frightening, it is that the authors and their friends actually believe this nonsense. If you want to learn about animal rights, go to the animal rights groups and animal rights philosophers and judge for yourself. On the other hand, if you want to learn what kinds of lies (delusions?) are promoted by animal exploiters then read this book."
1,Silly and badly researched,"If scare-mongering is your thing, this couple's hysteria-driven book is for you.An excellent gift for that special, simple-minded loved one in your life!"
1,Horrible!,"This movie is NOT Passion of the Christ! It is a bogus cheap rip off title to trick you into thinking it has something to do with the real film. It's a dull story about a monk who fancies a woman and then kills himself, or her I can't remember now. Bad acting, boring story, low budget. This movie sucks."
4,Pleasant 'coffee table book' on cartography,"This pleasant casual book on cartography is richly illustrated. Particulary appealing are the reporductions of the atlas maps in situ, with the atlas open to the map and the other pages and edges of the cover visible. Along similar lines, several closed atlases are pictured allowing one to view the cover and clasps. Also interspersed throughout this text are cartouches and title pages.I would not consider this an authoritative review of cartography. For example the maps illustrated from the monunmental 1513 Waldseemeuller Geography include two maps of Africa, and a map of Crete, hardly considered among the most influential maps from that Atlas. Nonetheless, this is a pleasurable book, richly illustrated, with an emphasis on the visual not written experience.Note that this book was reprinted in the U.S. in 2000, with the title ""Mapmaker's Art"", a more appropriate title given the book's emphasis."
1,Unfinishable,"I don't shut too many movies off in medias res. I definitely didn't expect to shut off a Woody Allen film in that manner. But I had to, just so I didnt have to hear myself halfheartedly guffaw a third time while trying to extract some joy from this tepid, unfunny, fantastic-in-the-bad-sense film. Its not a Woody Allen film per se-someone else wrote it, thank goodness...stars galore populate the screen, and not one of them really does anything funny or quirky at all...Allen's cynical mutterings are stale, and they let Eddie Griffin talk, and not Andy Dick? Watch the interviews with the cast to see them try and say something good about what they just excreted...that's funnier than than the film itself! Bad, bad, unequivocally awful movie no matter what the ravers say, if you have any intelligence or taste at all, heed my admonition, you will waste money on this!Why don't you see Sleeper instead?"
1,Woody at his worst,"This was just a very bad film. It was rarely funny and downright painful to watch at times. Woody is way out of his element in New Mexico where this idiotic film is supposed to take place.There is no question in my mind as to why this film never made it into theaters. It would have bombed in a big way. Even though there is a great cast, they don't have a good script to work with so the film falls right on its' face.Don't waste a second watching this huge disappointment."
1,Everyone Says They Hated It,"I can't remotely understand why Mr. Allen decided to participate in this awful movie. ""Picking Up the Pieces"" is everything except funny. I can't understand what attracted such talented people to a project like this one. The movie has no direction and it seems it's wandering aimlessly. The premise might offend some catholics and the movie certainly offends movie lovers. I know it offended me. Avoid."
1,Shockingly lousy.,"How on earth did they get so many fine actors to make this unbelievably boring movie? Its less funny that a Dave Barry column--and David Schwimmer comes off looking OK (check him out in Six Days, Seven Nights for some real unintentional comedy). Honestly, if you thought Plan 9 was tough to sit through....don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Picking Up the Feces,"I moaned throughout this sad little stain on Woody's resume. Iguess I was hoping that it would eventually get righted, but itnever happens. Once upon a time Woody directed and starredin Play It Again Sam, a bouquet to Casablanca, a film with oneof the best exit lines ever. Picking Up the Pieces ends withone of the worst.The execution of Kiefer Sutherland's character is unbearable to watch.He is made a human pinata and beaten to death by men, women,and children. There's no humor in it, vindication, carnal satisfaction.Nothing. Alfonso Arau slipped so badly it's hard to believe thesame guy directed Like Water for Chocolate. I guess we all havemissteps. This is a trip, stumble, and fall."
4,old faithful,"This movie is made in typical Woody Allen splendor. David Schwimmer is adorable as a priest who has little respect for his vows, and though I'm not much of a Sharon Stone fan, she was enjoyable as an unfaithful wife with a supposedly holy middle finger. I recommend this movie for all Woody Allen fans. You won't be disappointed."
1,piece of junk -- melted while cooking egg,"would NOT recommend. After using for less than 2 months, one of the spatula already melted while cooking an egg. The spatula melted while I was trying to get it under my egg to flip it, so it wasn't even on there for that long. Now we'll see whether they stand behind the lifetime warranty. But if I were you, I would just save yourself the hassle in the first place."
1,Too flimsy,This project is not stiff enough to do its job properly. Even for such small items as fried eggs it did not work well.
1,Poor quality. Lasted a week.,This spatula set can't stand up to basic pancake and egg cooking. They were flaking off in the food after a week. We hand washed too so no dishwasher to blame. Stay away.
2,"Frayed edges, not strong enough",I really like the look and feel of these spatulasThe handle are quite durable and feel great in the handhowever the nylon surface just is not what I had hoped forthe edge has frayed with use (looks like it has melted and I don't cook on extreme heat)
5,Fantastic sci-fi!,"Ascension is probably the best Black Library book. It builds magnificently on Dawn of War (although it also stands on its own), and it looks as though CS Goto has been cut loose from the confines of the game. The Blood Ravens space marines turn out to be fascinating and multidimensional. The eldar background is detailed and thrilling. There are mysteries and revelations in bags! Personally, I also really enjoyed the scenes showing Ckrius (Goto's guardsman from Dawn of War) being transformed into a marine ... slowly and painfully. It's awesome, and I've never seen anything like it from BL.Ascension is the start of something wonderful, buy it."
3,Not that great,"I have to disagree with most of the other reviewers. Space Marines should be fairly one dimensional characters by virtue of the role in the Warhammer universe, trying to make them deep does the lore a disservice. Ascension is a muddled mess when it comes to making the marines ""real"" characters. At times they the Blood Ravens are presented as some sort of pain cult, other times a society of navel gazers, with little or no history to explain why either (or both) behaviors are part of the chapter's lore.Few Black Library authors have gone after the Eldar, so Goto could set the standard and it's a bit disappointing that the Eldar are not very distinctive. Aside from the usage of Psi powers, one could replace all references to Eldar with IG regiments and it wouldn't much change the flavor of the story...The mechanics of Goto's of writing and descriptions of the battles are on par with the better authors in the 40k universe. Overall, not a bad book, but not great."
4,"great game, great plot","i really enjoyed this game. i'm not one for shooter games, or ones with excessive violence, so i really enjoy spyro games. it took me a few weeks to finish the game, but i didn't sit infront of it all day either. this is one game i would play again. the plot was great, it when right along with spyro's world, and i did find it a bit chalenging in places. at one point i did give up on it for about half a week though because i couldn't find all the relics to get i to defeat the game boss, but i soon figured it out. i recomend this game if you want adventure without the excessive violence."
3,Frustrating,Hard to get the dragon to fly. Wears your fingers out from constantly holding the buttons down. When you die. You start over.
3,Not worth it!,"My daughter is a cheerleader and so i figured give her room a little spirit! Well I figured that the sign would have been a lot bigger. Got it in the mail and it was sooo little I was a bit upset, so if you are like me and you figure it will be as big as I did do not get it!! Over all it is quite cute!"
1,Not Worth Finishing,"Originally excited to be reading a new Bourne novel, I was quickly disappointed in the way Mr. Van Lustbader handled this character created by Robert Ludlum. In fact, I only managed to get half-way through the book before having to put it away. I got increasinlgy tired of the bland characterization of the main people, and the stereotypes of the supporting characters (such as the chauvanistic Director of the CIA). And, sadly, the true identity of Bourne's assassin was very easy to determine. There were too many instances in which, as a reader, I had to suspend my disbelief. I fully enjoy this genre of fiction, and I know it may not always qualify as ""good literature,"" but I expect a little more than this.Since I didn't finish the entire novel, I don't know how it ends, but as I wasn't enjoying the story, I'm not that upset. I'll just go back and read the original Ludlum Bourne novels, where I actually cared about the characters."
2,Not sure what happened.,If you have read the first 3 books then you know that their are differences in those plots compared to the movie. This book by no means measures up to the first 3. To me it seems that it keeps the same story line of the original books but the writing seems more action oriented than the drama that Ludlum wrote.
3,Bored of Bourne,"One week before an international summit condemnging terrorism, Jason Bourne aka David Web's two closest friends, his controler, and psychiatrist are mysteriously murdered. Bourne arrives only minutes too late to save them, and is left taking the blame for their murders. Pursued by the CIA, and the mysterious assassin, Bourne goes to the summit to find out who is trying to set him up.A good story, enough action, and plot twists for two books, my only complaint; the author makes it all too obvious who the mysterious assassin is, a quarter of the way through the book.At fifty some odd years of age, Jason Bourne is just getting a bit old to be chasing around the world, looking to terrorists on the loose. That's why Clive Cussler retired his best known character, Dirk Pitt, because he was getting too old for the chases, fights, and shootouts!"
1,Worst book I've ever read,"Spoiler alert!!This book was a waste of my time and my money. The only redeeming value it has is that it is atleast a quick read so it didn't waste too much of my time. Bad dialogue is everywhere in this book, and the story is ridiculous. Webb's son comes back from the dead to hunt him down and kill him? And ofcourse he just happens to be trained to kill on top of that. One of the above reviews likened it to Guiding Light, and I'd almost agree if I didn't dislike this book so much. That's right, I'd appreciate Guiding Light more than this book. If Amazon would allow me to give it 0 stars I would. I keep the book around so people will ask me about it and I can do them the favor of driving them away from it."
1,Eric Van Lustbader Missed The Boat,"Eric Van Lustbader completely missed the boat in his attempt to create a fourth Jason Bourne book. There are two stars to Ludlum's own books, David Web and Marie St. Jacques. The keys to those books are that Marie is as smart and decisive as David and that he is nothing without her. Instead, Van Lustbader not only cuts her out of the novel (and incidentally kills off two of the other major characters of the first three books so that he doesn't have to deal with them), but writes a sexist novel that bears no relationship whatever to anything that Ludlum ever wrote.It's a sad thing that the editors either didn't catch these things or didn't care!"
1,Farcical,"What a load of crap!It reads OK, but the story is so incredibly full of improbable impossibilities that it defies believability completely.Skip it. You won't miss anything.D Dalley"
5,I loved it.,"I didn't have any problems reading it, I'm not sure what's wrong with the others who commented. There are some blanks that could be filled, but I'm hoping that will happen in ""The Bourne Betrayal"". Over all, it was very entertaining."
1,Why an author's estate should never sell rights to a series,"If you want a hero maimed ten times more than necessary, or if you want a troubled past reflected until you can quote the next reiteration go ahead and try and finish the book. The book was very bad."
1,St. Martin's Paperbacks must have been smoking crack!,"Don't bother buying this book. The author's use of grammar and mediocre storytelling make this book an absolute waste of money. Although it may say Robert Ludlum on the front cover, there is no way he would have approved such a piece of junk. Robert Ludlum has got to be turning over in his grave! I would give -0- stars if it were possible."
2,Sadly my last Jason Bourne book,"It took me a while to get up the nerve to pick up the first installment of Van LustBADers Bourne books for fear of having my heart ripped out. I finally picked it up and now that I have, I truly wish that I had not. The experience is similar to the feeling of savoring the taste of your favorite dessert all the the way through only to find, oh, let just say a roach at the end. Crass? Yes, but that's how it feels. Somewhere between the comic book style of writing and the random, lengthy history lesson on Crete in chapter 16 (WTF) where I found myself skipping forward, Jason Bourne died for me.I absolutely loved this series. It is hard to see it go down like this. More important than a good story, is a great story teller. The voice behind a story is what makes that book live. I don't know Van Lustbader but he should stop feeding off of carrion, have a little integrity, and find his own kill. Yes, I am calling him a vulture. Let Bourne rest in peace.I miss Ludlum's voice."
2,Bourne Loser,"Who wants to read a re-invented Jason Bourne? Every character in this book is a tortured hero, struggling with their motives. The characters view their emotions like strange and curious dinner guests. In past stories, Jason Bourne was always in control even when he was cast clueless into any chaotic situation. This Bourne gives the impression of stumbling about, being lead along by various foes. He comes off as the 3rd - 4th strongest agent in the book (a sacriledge). Save your time, read something else."
2,The Bourne Legacy,A book has to grab me from the get go but this one did not. I put the book down after reading about 50 pages.
4,A great read ...,"I'm not a literary critic so I'm not going to deeply analyze the plot or compare Lustbader to Ludlum. However, having read ALL of the Bourne series from the original 3 written by Ludlum to the additional 5 I think it is now by Lustbader it is all good fun. If you like the Bourne character, the genre, and the general storyline then you will like all of them. I read for entertainment and for something to help me escape reality when I am frequently stuck in ""cattle class"" on a US air carrier, on a plane that is loaded to the gills, surrounded by screaming kids, and a beer will cost me $6. Cracking good read all, great for escaping air travel hell or enjoying a day at the beach."
3,enjoyable thriller,"I've read several of Ludlum's books, but none of the Bourne series, so I hope I bring a little distance to the reviewing process. Eric Van Lustbader has taken on the Bourne franchise and in this first work done a commendable although flawed job.I found the book to start slowly and the general outline to be predictable. The reader can see the terrorists and the Iceland summit will intersect with Bourne's quest to find the killers of his mentor (Conklin) early on. However the journey is fun, and there are a number of interesting twists, in both Bourne/Webb's personal life and in his investigation. Lots of action and gore, with a little torture thrown in. After the book gets started the pace accelerates quickly.I don't find Eric Van Lustbader to write as well as Ludlum or push the narrative as well, but the book made for an enjoyable 2 day read. It made me want to read the rest of the Bourne series, so it was not only fun but useful"
3,OK,"Thought it was okay. Not worth buying, but if you find a 1 cent copy and a used bookstore, go for it dude."
1,Horrible,"I could barely stand to push through this book. I've enjoyed thrillers almost since I first began reading chapter books at a young age. And while I've been mildly annoyed at the strange editing issues that seem to plague some series (Vince Flynn's books come to mind, where a perfectly good passage will suddenly be marred by a random series of incomplete sentences apparently intended to represent some sort of thought), this book was virtually unreadable. It read like a children's book, with the author violating the basic rule of ""show, don't tell"" that every *good* author adheres to. The opening of the book was good in and of itself, but as it went along the story itself was subsumed under the load of horrible writing."
1,"This is a screenplay, not a novel.","Reading the book, I had the feeling that Lustbader is already dreaming about the money he'll make from selling the movie rights.As many tired old Hollywood clichés that were packed into this book, there can be only one choice to play the role of Jason Bourne: Nicolas Cage."
3,2 1/2 Stars -- A Fast-Reading But Very Predictable Thriller!,"Eric Van Lustbader wrote this book in the style of Robert Ludlum -- but unfortunately, the style Ludlum wrote in in his later years, in which he used a 'cookie cutter-like' formula. While the story moves along at a quick pace, it is very predictable. The characters are mostly one dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogue is often unrealistic and corny, and the action, while plentiful, provides no real surprises. The Bourne Legacy is good enough to finish, but not good enough start (if you haven't already gone out and bought it). The Bourne Legacy is not a bad book, it's just not a very good one."
4,"New writer, new style, new characters",This book can not be compared against original trilogy. People reading this thrilling novel shall be aware that a new writer has took over the Bourne character. Same thing happens in the evolution of great comic titles from DC & Marvel.I'm very pleased to see a new Bourne being reshaped by Lustbader.
2,This book is dumb,"This book is terribly written, filled with repetitive cliches and sloppy sentences. I am going to finish reading it only because I am slightly mentally ill in regards to books.Actually, I never finished reading it. Perhaps I am not so insane as I thought."
4,OK,"BOOK WAS GOOD , BUT I WAS NOT USE TO SEEING BOURNE GET BEAT UP THROUGHOUT THE BOOK . LOST TOO MANY BATTLES . LUDLUM WOULD BE SAD TO SEE IT.."
3,Some revelations,"Like many others I came to the book series (this is my first Bourne) via the two movies. While the book was nothing exceptional it did give some insights on the differences between the movie and book Bourne. The movie makes it seem like Bourne was in Europe from the start, while this book shows us his roots in Vietnam and other info on his background. I like globe trotting adventures, so it hit the sweet spot for me in that sense. A bit too Noir in stages, but overall it was well worth finishing..., even if there is a unbelievability factor towards the end that Bourne movies seem to avoid."
1,Painful...,"I didn't actually ""read"" this book, I bought it on CD since I do a lot of driving and there's nothing better than books on CD for long drives... well, usually anyway. This book about put me to sleep CD after painful CD. I really wanted to stop listening to it after about the 3rd CD, but I was hoping it was going to get better, not so ""predictably boring""... but I was wrong. Thank God I didn't fall asleep at the wheel listening to this 14 CD set of babble... save your money, or spend it on a good Ludlum book like Bourne Identity or something."
1,Absolute garbage!,"This book is really a waste of time --- doesn't deserve to be in the ""Bourne"" grouping. The story is ridiculous, and it doesn't stop long enough to develop any kind of background that would have given the story credibility. It is more obsessed with shoot em ups and hand to hand combat -- in reality this ""book"" is a verbal video game. It's a tragedy that the author is allowed to still use the name ""Robert Ludlum"" attached to books like this. I think he'd roll over in his grave if he saw his legacy destroyed like this."
1,Obscenity riddled violence extreme waste of time,Author apparently believes the worst of profanity makes for the best writing. Ludlum must be rolling in his grave Book much better used as a door stop or for kindling
2,The Bourne Legacy,"The Bourne LegacyThis did not have the feel of a Ludlum and Jason. In parts of this it felt like Jason has been there before, done this story line."
1,Simply Embarrassing,"I have come to expect a lot from the Bourne series - impressed by the restraint, consistency, attention to detail, continuity and directness of style. Lustbader could not be farther from this ""legacy.""Stuffed to overflowing with useless, flowery, adverb-laden descriptions bringing little or nothing to a story full of embarrassing holes and continuity flaws, this book could have been a quarter of its length and it STILL would have been boring and childish in its construction.I am not want to be so brutal in a review, in fact, I don't usually review a book unless I have a compelling reason. In this case the reason is Lustbader's disappointing level of respect for the notable body of work that proceeded.I wish I had the time back that I devoted to this mess of a story."
1,"I dunno, ""A Bourne Travesty""","It's one cliff hanger after the next, designed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Trouble is, nearly all the bad guys are such unbelievably stupid, paper-thin caricatures, and all the escapes from what, in the real world, would have been certain doom are likewise so lacking in believability and imagination, that I found myself hating myself for continuing to read the book. Because I liked the Bourne character and was thinking Ludlum to be a shameless laugh-all-the-way-to-the-bank cynic to have approved of the use of his creation just to make some more money I was greatly relieved when I read a review in amazon.com to learn that Robert Ludlum had passed away, by which I mean that hopefully it's not his fault, that hopefully he had no part in allowing this novel to be published. I don't think you will have to read very far in this novel to see if you agree with me or not."
2,"This is like Jason Bourne on Steroids, except exactly the opposite.","If they made a pill that was the exactly opposite of steroids, and taking it you wimpy and soft, Jason Bourne must have taken it in this book. A lot of the book is set some what late in Bourne's life making him seem old and a step too slow. I bought this on CD to listen to on my ride across the Pennsylvania Turnpike and it was a huge mistake. This was my first foray into reading a book written by an author who did not create the character he was writing about. Never again will I make this mistake. I think is is just the publishers way of churning out more material with the ""Jason Bourne"" brand on it to make a quick dime. Well, it worked but take it from me this was not worth your time."
1,JASON BOURNE IS NOT A WIMP!!!,"JASON BOURNE IS NOT A WIMP!!!Who is this character? Clearly he is not the Jason Bourne that Robert Ludlum envisioned.If you enjoyed the first three novels, the originals, DO NOT read this book. What a let down!!!"
1,Disappointment,"Coming from a huge Robert Ludlum fan, The Bourne Legacy is a huge disappointment. Lustbade totally devated from the original Bourne trilogy. The writing style leaves much to be desired. I typically read a Ludlum novel in 1 to 2 days. This book was so boring it took me 3 weeks to finish. About the only thing I like about the book is that he brought his son into the picture. But even the development of that was week. Eric Van Lustbader, please don't dishonor Robert Ludlum and write another Ludlum based novel. PLEASE!!!!"
3,"Just OK, so it's a letdown.","First off, let me say this, if there is a 5th Bourne book, I'd buy it.However, this wasn't that great. If you are fan of the first three books, I think that you will be disappointed. If you thought the first three were too long and tedious, and you wish James patterson had written them, then you'll love this one.My main problem with the book is this...the first three books had FOUR main caracters: Bourne, Conklin, Panov, and Marie. In this book (SPOILER) two die in the first chapter, the other gets ZERO dialoge. ZERO. That's not what Ludlum created.Then, the whole Kahn thing. Just completely out of left field. Lustbader just came up with a way of being able to write 10 more books in the series.So, while I'd buy a next book in the series, I can't imagine I'd buy the sixth...."
2,wish you could see my disappointed face,"Got it together with 'the coil' as lynds was advertised as mrs ludlum, hoping the ludlum legacy lives on somewhere but it was a disappointment!! of the two novels this one is worse, neither has anything to do with ludlum and i sincerely hope the estate will sue the publisher for false advertising. dear author: change the names of characters, remove references to jason's past and try sell it as a stand alone story, maybe you won't get so many desippointed readers."
1,Having trouble continuing the chapters...it's really that bad,"Having real trouble even getting through the first couple chapters. If you've watched the Bourne movies and wanted to keep continuing the story (as I wanted to) then this seemed like a good way to keep it alive. The writing, however, is awful. The book isn't suspenseful and doesn't grip you like it should. On top of that, the book doesn't pick up where the 3rd movie left off. Characters are now alive that were already dead and the author has no idea how to write a spy novel or anything about weaponry, tactics, hand-to-hand combat or anything of the sort. Seriously, do not buy it. I want to toss the book before I keep reading and he ruins the trilogy for me."
4,returning fan,It's been years since I've read a Jason Bourne book and it took me right back to the suspense and thrill ride that Eric Lustbader creates with this character.
2,Borne Legacy,"I had hoped to pick up the Borne/Webb character from where the trilogy/films left off. For anyone who planned on doing that, I would avoid it. The plots for all the Borne books are totally different from the film (people who died in the first film are alive again and the stories are dramatically different).It would still be a good read if it were well written, but alas, it's a huge departure from Ludlum's beautiful style."
1,not great,"I picked this book up after finishing the original Bourne series and was disappointed. ""The Bourne Legacy"" is cliche ridden and full of ridiculous ""plot twists"" that will have you rolling your eyes in exasperation. The author seems to have attempted to add his own style to the series by killing off key characters in the first few pages and remaking the Bourne character into someone who resembles the original in name only.Pick this book up if you're stuck at the airport or bus stop with nothing to read-- but avoid it if you're looking for a continuation of Ludlum's work."
3,I miss Jason Bourne,Too bad Matt Damon would not continue as Bourne. The continuing saga of Jason Bourne would have been the basis for a much better movie. The movie should not have been called Bourne Legacy.
5,The Bourne Legacy,My sincere apologies for not reviewing this product in a more timely manner. The book was excellent and arrived undamaged and protected from the elements and delivery service. Your customer service is excellent!Thank you.Darrell Fisher
1,Not worth the time,"Even if you can get it cheap, I found halfway through that I just wanted it to be over. I didn't engage with the characters at all. There were problems with believability, not just with super-human feats but with other things (e.g. trained agents using personal credit cards or cell phones while on the run). Lots of problems.If this were a stepping-stone to other, better sequels it could possibly be worth it, otherwise I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Missed the mark,"Probably would have been OK, had I not had such high expectations. The story has decent action sequences, but how does the bad guy keep anticipating Jason's every move? It was just a let down after a fantastic series by Ludlum."
1,Missed it...,"I am sorry, but Mr. Van Lustbader missed the mark trying to pick up the gauntlet of telling a tale involving Jason Bourne. The book is disjointed, coming back to characters in later chapters that you have almost completely forgotten about, mainly because they were not richly layered and revealed in any depth in the first place. And Jason Bourne himself, as a world-class spy and assassin we all know and love, comes off as a bumbling inept who seems to dodge certain death only by the even greater ineptitude of the adversaries he encounters. Lustbader's Bourne relies heavily upon people he has only just met, and knows much too little about, and spends almost the entire book being used as a pawn by others. The story has none of the heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat excitement we expect, and so many holes in it as to be almost unreadable. Nice try, but it missed."
2,Worked hard to finish it.,It's pretty obvious that this will not be made into the 4th Bourne movie. It'd be a travesty if it was.
3,The Bourne Legacy,"I am a fan of the bourne series and so was curious as to how this book would turn out to be. Although the book was fast-paced,the plot had loose ends and a lot of the action required a significant suspension of belief. One very surprising thing was the complete lack of Marie in the novel. David and Marie are very close to each other so it is very hard to imaging webb not contacting or even pausing for a moment to think about her during the entire course of the book. lustbader seems to be interested only in bourne himself and inserts him into another world. even bourne has been reduced to an ordinary fighter with lucky escapes. on the whole, not a great read."
1,Did the author actually read his own work?,"I wish i would have read the other reviews on this book before i discovered it in the airport bookstore.Let me start out by saying I am a Ludlum fan, and have enjoyed passing many a travel hour submerged in the adventures of Jason Bourne. That being said i was extreemly excited when i spotted this book on the shelf.Much to my chagrin, this is one of the most disjointed, poorly written, un-edited, unbelievable pieces of fiction I have ever read. The plot twists are juvenile, and in many cases, completely impossible. It makes me wonder if the author took time to read his own work after the day or so it seems it took to write.Stay away."
1,Heart-wrenchingly disappointing!,"As author ofAN UNQUIET AMERICANa political thriller about clandestine activities, I can sympathize with Lustbader taking on the task of writing the Bourne Legacy. But as reluctant as I am to criticize a fellow author, I must say that this book is a disappointment. This portrayal of Jason Bourne, even if he's now retired from the CIA, is inconsistent with the dynamic, conflicted, intelligent, quick thinking Bourne we all know and love. I don't think I would ever write someone else's character - you live with the characters you create day and night, know their every thought and nuance and they develop from the depths of your own soul and understanding of them like a family member - that's tough to replicate and Lustbader definitely falls short. Such a disappointment."
3,"Fun characters, but the nerdy talk . . . ew.","Good parts: The characters are a hoot. While many were farfetched, they were believable enough to suspend disbelief and just enjoy. The book was fun, and I laughed many times.Not as good parts: The plot behind it was kind of predictable, but that wasn't a major problem because the people were interesting. However, the ""nerdy talk"" during sex was just too over the top. It was just kind of . . . icky, for lack of a better word, and really turned me off the book every time I got to one of those scenes."
1,Just a little much,"The sexual innuendos in this story really got to be too much, one after the other after the other, they just weren't funny anymore. My feeling is that the author had a so so story to tell so she had to fill in the balnks with something, she chose more sex, more innuendos, very boring. I thought the best part of the book was the last page Where Are They Now ""four year's later."" I skimmed the book until the end because I was stuck on an airplane for many hours, if not I would have passed this book to someone else."
4,Loaded With Quirky Fun,"As a long-time fan of Ms. Thompson's, her latest book wasn't quite as good as my expectations for it, but I still enjoyed the story. The heroine and hero are both unique and supported by a quirky cast of secondary characters. If you are first-time reader of Ms. Thompson's I wouldn't suggest starting with this book, but do pick it up for a fun afternoon read."
4,"Fun, sexy, lighthearted reading!","This is the first in the Nerd series that I've read and it made me want to go get all the others! The characters are believable and funny and the plot is intriguing enough that it kept me from putting the book down! It is sensual and sexy, while being really funny and not too predictable, and like many others have commented, I often laughed out loud! It is the perfect take-to-the-beach romance! It mixes comedy with romance and a good plot in a way I've never read before! Kudos!!"
3,Overdone plot of Model & Engineer Whose Love Conquers Common Sense,"Engineer Charles finds Eve after an explosion. She is mum. They meet at a bar and after she beats him in a pool game, they start a relationship. Hedoesn't want to kiss or have sex because of plans to leave for a new town.Yet their chemistry is undeniable. He becomes part of her life with the Hoovercraft, as other reviewers note. They become unseparable. There are lots of other characters involved including a devious cousin who tries to steal the plans in order to pay a gambling debt, an insaitable nymph.,Eve's sister and Hot Buns bakery. After the initial break-in, Charles seems overly daft in trying to identify the culprit. ignoring the obvious.Toward the end, after their first consumation, love and sex preoccupiesalmost all of their actions. The book drags on and on. This is not one of Lewis's best works. I enjoyed reading it in one sitting but come awayfeeling rather cheated, especially at the surprise ending."
1,The other kid is a fool.,"Please people; don't be idiots. Make use of my handy set of safety rules so you don't cause loss of eyes.(or lives)Always wear safety goggles when participating in an airsoft war.Pay attention to the velocity in feet per second (fps) of your airsoft gun.guns with velocity under 300 fps can be played with safely.(as long as you are wearing safety goggles.)If your gun has over 300 fps BE CAREFUL. It can potentially cause injury.If your gun has 600-800 fps, DO NOT FIRE IT AT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING UNLESS THEY ARE WEARING FULL PROTECTIVE GEAR(i.e. vest, helmet with faceplate, and protective pants.)If your gun has over 800 fps it is a sporting gun and SHOULD NEVER BE SHOT AT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.Follow these rules if youn do not want to be like that poor other kid and almost kill your grandpa."
1,y is this gun so sucky?,wow my grandpa joe bought me this gun for x-mas and i gotta say i thought it would rock. my grandpa joe wanted 2 no how it felt so i shot him from 10ft away lets just say it wasnt a very happy x-mas in the HOSPITAL. and th sad thing is it broke after my mom ran it over.HOW CHEAP!
3,Keep it coming,"I am not one of their oldest fans having been introduced to them by way of 2002's Richest Man in Babylon. The ambient grooves and sampling are relaxing if a little repetitive. Still, its very listenable, intriguing, and testament to the future direction of the band."
4,"Cool album, kids","A great combination of S-American influences with dub and I also feel there's some British influence there... If you enjoyed the instrumental stuff from DJ Krush, DJ Shadow, Nightmares on Wax you will enjoy this album for sure, but it is less obscure sounding, much more accesible and dance-able. It reminded me of this really great album Bleak Output by Noon [Polish DJ], though it has more vairiation in beats and instrumentation. Noon's album is more mood, melancholy in this case. And you can hardly expect dub from Poland. But decide for yourself."
4,Hail to the Thievery Corp.,"Bottom Line: if you like early Massive Attack, you'll love Thievery Corporation."
2,The -rare- least favorite of the Thievery cd's...,"I really only liked two tracks on this album.Manha2001 Spliff odysseyThat's a shame really b/c I have every other album of theirs and truly enjoy them. This was just too off the wall for me. The sounds didn't quite gel together as nicely as other known Thievery Tracks. I'm picky though so read the other reviews and listen for yourself. I'm a huge downtempo fan and this cd goes down at the bottom of the list for me. If you're just getting started with these guys, try the Mirror Conspiracy or the Richest Man in Babylon."
2,Repititive and Generic,"This album is slow, rarely original, hardly exciting, and the same sounds are recycled in all but one song. The same drum beats echo over and over until the very end, where the pace picks up a tad bit. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you enjoy easy listening type background music."
2,Disappointing,I love the Corporation. But this album does not have all of the songs iTune has. The price was great...just need to make sure the songs that I listen to are on the CD. This was disappointing.
1,lifeless restaurant muzak,"i like some of the other downtempo stuff, but i've listened to this one three times now and i still can't ever tell when it's on except that i become impatient and have to will myself to let it play all the way through. it just flat-out bores the s**t out of me. ten year old future sound of london lps had much more of a flow to them than this does. what, these guys play this music in their restaurant? ok, i guess. salad-eating music. but turn it down."
2,Not The Place...,"For ""USA"": Lighten up, pal. It's only a review. This is not a forum for blasting fellow reviewers. You are obviously a member of the band; otherwise, you would have marked the review ""not helpful (or ignored it altogether)"". The album is weak. Bottom line. By the way, irregardless is not a word."
4,This album ranks among the best of its genre.,"For all those who enjoyed, yet were not completely satisfied by DJ Shadow's Entroducing..., this album possibly your Holy Grail. This is music that blurs the boundaries between acid jazz, ambient, reggae, and trip-hop. Remaining true to the spirit of ambient pioneer Brian Eno,one may listen to this album closely and enjoy its artistic beauty, or effectively ignore it, using its even rhythms to set an amazingly relaxed backdrop. Thievery Corporation have crafted one of the most cerebral musical journeys I have heard to date. This album is a feast for the mind as well as the ears, ranking Eric and Rob alongside Michael Paradinas (mu-ziq) and Paul Hartnoll (Orbital) as some of the most innovative DJ's around. As hyped as this release has been, I was prepared for disappointment, however, this album is every bit as good as advertised. Simply put, you have nothing in your collection without this."
3,"Good, but not great.","This is Thievery Corporation's first album, released shortly after the talented ""duo"" hooked up in DC. If you're familiar with their later works, i.e. The Mirror Conspiracy or the Cosmic Game- then you'll notice this cd is lacking in some of the many intricacies that can be found there. Although still a good cd, it doesn't last as long in my changer as - say - DJ Kicks."
4,keep playing it,"perhaps not their best album in comparison to 'the mirror conspiracy', but good and solid- you will not regret you bought it. so buy it...hurry!"
2,not an encyclopedia,If the author thinks because he includes every climate zone and briefly touches each subject makes his book an encyclopedia he is dead wrong. The information is very basic at best but includes nice drawings. Reading the section on primitive firemaking for example I doubt the author ever did it by himself (I did). He mentioned a lot of friction methods but omitted (as usual) the important details for success. If you want a real encyclopedia John Wiseman's SAS Survival Book would be a better choice.
4,A good textbook for zooarchaeology,"I have once again ordered Terry O'Connor's excellent introduction to zooarchaeology as the primary text for my one semester long (13 weeks) course on zooarchaeology.While this is not a comprehensive guide to zooarchaeology, I believe it is the best introduction currently available for undergraduate students, for the following reasons:a. it covers a wide range of topics, including areas that might receive less coverage in most North American courses (e.g. analysis of complex urban economies)b. it uses examples from a variety of areasc. it is well written, with little use of jargond. each chapter serves very well to introduce major topics in zooarchaeology; these can be supplemented by journal readings selected by the instructor to provide more detailed case studies for students to read.e. it is reasonably priced"
1,a complete bomb,"This is not a book, just a bunch of badly photocopied sheets stuck in a cheap $1.00 ringbinder. Whats more the sheets come sealed in cellophane so you can't even flick through them to review the contents. It is outrageous that anyone can justify the price being charged. Do not waste money and time ordering this."
2,Disappointed,"...For $69.00 I expected more than a 3-ring binder with photocopies inside. Very unprofessional in appearance. It was of very little use to me. I spent less on a book that was thicker and more informational on another ""how to"" subject."
1,"Save your money, this one is a rip off!","Wow,what a dissapointment! I don't mind paying high prices for a photo copied book if the content is good. This book was so basic. As a person with years of marketing experience, I can tell you that I dissagree with a lot of her suggestions. The typos are distracting and unprofessional, I hope her marketing materials aren't this sloppy. The financial suggestions are scarey. This author needs to stick to planning parties and leave the financial and marketing advice up to those who know what they are talking about. I recommend you buy DOLLARS AND EVENTS if you want realistic and helpful information on starting your own business. Save your money, don't buy this one."
1,Disappointing,"After waiting 8 days with excited anticipation to receive my ""how to"" guide on starting my own event planning business, disappointment was all I felt. Not only does it come in a plain black binder with photocopied pages, the table of contents was placed in it backwards. Even though I was skeptical, I began to read and tried to remain open minded that perhaps the content would be worth the inflated price for a plain black binder. I was disappointed again when I realized no true editing had been done. There seemed to be many grammatical errors and the writer and editor used spell check but did not read word for word to check for accuracy in content. I stopped reading and started looking for a more professional guide to meet my professional expectations."
2,Don't waste your money.,... Her financial suggestions are scary as one reviewer put it. One suggestion she offered could bring problems for her vendors as well as herself.Some of her ideas are useful and helpful but some things are just plain common sense.This book basically tells how to inflate your fee and deceive the vendors and the couple. If there were any spelling mistakes they did fix them. But the price for this book is very over inflated. I would really recommend you to keep shopping around for another book to help you start your party planning business. I know I am.
4,Great for beginners,"I bought several event planning books and this has by far been the best for a beginner who's looking for the ins and outs of the business. Excellent information and detailed scripts of ""how to"" run your own business without it being too ""technical"". Only downfalls are 1)the book really focuses on running a wedding planner business, but the ideas can be transfered to any ""planning"" business and 2)the format of the ""book"" is really just 8x11 photo copies in a standard 3 ring binder. If you don't expect it to look pretty, you'll be happy with the content."
1,This binder is not worth the money. . .,"They even stuck the label on the wrong side of the binder. If you want to learn how to cheat your customers out of money then it is worth it. But as I see it it's a poor way to run a business. It's a ""cheap $1.00 binder"" with photocopied pages. I should of listened to all the reviews."
4,Well acted,"Seyfried's acting is brilliant in this film. Yes the film is mostly dark and gloomy but it is supposed to be, it's a psychological thriller. Like most films there are many improbable acts that occur but they actually fit a desperate persons MO.I didn't fully understand why the ""new' detective (forgot his name)was highlighted when he made some odd remarks but I guess it was to throw the viewers off. Here is a film that knows how to stir up true suspense and fear. I love the imaginative lies Seyfried's character told strangers while acting as a quasi detective trying to find her sister. They were elaborately realistic. This is fun movie making that was shot with much expertise. So much so that I decided to buy the blu ray after renting it, which says a lot. The only disappointment was that the disc contained no extras. I'm hoping for a re-release special edition that gets into the nitty- gritty of the film (unlikely though). Highly recommended for fans of the psych/thriller genre."
3,Mystery and suspense,It was a good film but it moved slow in spots. The acting was well done and the plot was interesting
3,huh?!,I gave this movie 3 stars because I like Amanda. But the real mystery is what happened to the cop that acted like he believed her and looked as though was going to be on her side. Then suddenly disappeared for the rest movie cuz he had to take his mom some soup?! They gave him too many lines in the beginning if he wasn't going to important in solving the case
3,good movie,"I really liked this movie all in all and Amanda Seyfriend played her role really role. I don't understand the role of Detective Hood, who they made seem really important at one point in time, but it was good overall. The ending really sucked to me, though. I just don't like how it feels less intense than everything else and it was kind of blah. I rented this from redbox though so no complaints. I usually rent them before I buy them off of amazon. I don't think this is one I will buy for keeps but it's a good movie. check it out."
3,depends on what u like,This movieis okay if u dont have anything else to watch. Plot and characters needed more development. Could have been an even better movie. Weird ending.
4,gone,this movie was different movie but it was good my wife did not like it.but i did it need to be a little bit spiceyer and it would of bing great.
3,Decent,"I'm tired of Amanda Seyfried, but she did pretty good in this movie. The acting was good, but not great. I liked the twist at the end with the sister, but I thought the bad guy turned out to be a total wuss and that just made me mad. I might watch it again, but I don't know if I would buy it for more than a few dollars."
2,GONE AND QUICKLY FORGOTTEN,"GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE. The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable. A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to ""bounce off of."" This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten."
2,Gone,"If you get anything from this movie it would be to move to Portland because apparently there you can elude the police every 5 seconds. I've never seen so much ridiculousness out of a movie. I thought the plot was interesting and I think it could've been well-done, however the whole thing was too unrealistic for my taste. As much as I would like to imagine our heroine as a butt-kicking desperado, I feel like if this was real life she would've been stopped immediately. Also found it to be very anti-climatic and was left with a ""Was that it?"" feeling after it was over. Don't waste the money or the time."
2,Completely unrealistic cops,"The cops in this exploitation thriller are the downfall. They don't believe the girl who claims she was abducted, nor are they interested that her sister has now disappeared, So, she conducts her own vigilante hunt for the bad guy, all the while eluding the dumb cops who are after her because she's got a gun and she's crazy. None of the cops are remotely realistic, nor is the lack of urgency in the whole affair. There are more red herrings here than in a jar of them. The finale is a hoot. Not credible at all. Watch if you like cheap thrillers with shots of sweaty and dirty bound girls writhing in tight t-shirts."
1,Terrible,Plot holes and ridiculousness. If you want to look at Amanda Seyfried - I recommend turning the sound off on this one and making up your own dialog. If I had done that it would get 3 stars.
2,It was just ok,It was a slow dragged out movie. There was some action and suspense. But mostly is was slow and you just wanted it to pick up and get really good and it never did.
4,Good movie,The movie was good. It didn't carry on forever and ended when it needed to. There wasn't anything that I disliked about the movie.
4,Good movie,"I liked this movie a lot. It might not have been too realistic, but hey, it's a movie so that doesn't bother me. That's what I watch movies for, escape from real life!"
3,thriller,"Thought this movie was ""ok"". Not bad, but not one that I would recommend. Kinda dragged on a bit too long."
2,90 Minutes of My Life I'll Never Get Back,"What could have been an interesting thriller is just a very generic retread of every every serial killer movie you've ever seen.You keep on waiting for the interesting plot twist that must be coming, but it never comes, and the ending is unbelievably abrupt,anticlimactic, and disappointing. Ed Siegel, former critic at the Boston Globe used to have a wonderful rating system for television ( * * * * Worth staying home for * * * Worth watching if you're home * * Worth watching if you're tired * Worth watching if you're sick - Worthless). By that standard, I'd have to give it the Ed Siegel 1 star rating."
2,Blah,Predictable and some annoying parts. Glad I waited until it came out of theaters. Very slow not much suspense or action.
2,Gone to soon,This movie could have been great but ruined it with that ending and all the plot twists just made it confusing not entertaining at all
5,loved it,i recommended this video already to many of my friends. it may appear a bit predictable but the characters worked well together and came off exceptionally well i believe.
3,Gone,"Just finished seeing Gone.The movie on a whole was fairly good,and the story seemed to move along. My only problem was,the solution reminded me of getting a box of Cracker Jacks, which I like, but it was missing the special prize inside. Judge for yourself , my suggestion is if interested,to rent ,not own."
3,Gone is dark,"I ordered it because I like the star Amanda Seifried. It was okay, but I was a little disappointed. There were minimal actors and film was very dark. I had to strain my eyes to see it at times."
3,Okay movie,The movie was okay. It was entertaining. The ending could have been a lot better. Seems like they just gave up at the end.
4,Good movie,Great movie! It kept you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.
3,exciting at times.,"A young woman who lives with her sister goes to the police to report her sister's abduction. They do not believe her because she had previously reported her own abduction and they did not find evidence of it. She sets out on her own to chase after the man that she thinks has her sister. This is an exciting enough movie that is carried pretty well by Amanda Seyfried. There is tension throughout, as the viewer is following her pursuit of the abductor. The storyline may be a bit unrealistic, but not so much that it is totally unbelievable. This one is a nice mystery that is thrilling at times and is worth watching."
1,Poor...,"If you like Amanda Seyfried,then this is your movie , because she is in EVERY minute of this very mediocre 'thriller'."
3,NOTHING ELSE TO WATCH THAT NIGHT,"Okay, the movie wasn't bad. Not stellar, but not bad. It was an interesting story, and it gave me and my girlfriend something to watch besides Arachnoquake on the SyFy channel.Decent suspense and nice finish."
4,Great movie!,I really enjoyed this movie. It was suspensful and had twists and turn I didn't expect. Love Amanda Seyfried - she's a great actress!
4,Gone,"I am not the type of viewer who over analyzes a movie. I don't critique actors or actresses. I don't wonder what the director or writer was thinking. I don't look at action scenes and automatically say I hate the movie because the special effects are not realistic. I look at a movie for what it is, pure entertainment. If I am entertained for two hours and the story seemed interesting then I am a fan.With that being said, I liked the movie Gone. I thought the story was interesting and the movie kept me entertained. I would recommend anyone who is interested in a psyhological thriller to watch Gone. Enjoy it."
3,Solid script but a flawed film.,"I had the opportunity to read the screenplay for this movie well before it was produced and the script was wonderful. A great, fun, tense read...unfortunately, due to some bad casting, and some bad direction, the movie didn't end being so good. But it's still worth your time to see Amanda Seyfried pull off a decent performance."
2,"Gone is a good title ""gone to the dogs""",The only thing that will stay with you is the bad taste. Don't waste time or money with this one.
2,"Frustrating, But Good Acting By Seyfried.","Amanda Seyfried was great, Dialog was vacant, the scenario was frustrating, and the end was confusing. I'm glad I waited for video."
3,Eh...,"I was really excited to see this movie based on the previews and good reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. It had some decent action scenes and suspense, but I thought the backstory could have been developed more and the ending could have been better. It just came across as a generic, predictable thriller."
3,Pretty predictable.,"One of the movies i'd be dis-appointed in paying theatre prices. For the home screen & rental (would not want a purchase) it ok. Slight twist with the ending, other wise been there done that."
1,Not Gone Enough,"Crime thrillers need some degree of believability. So how the police seem to be portrayed as dumb (as usual by Hollywood writers), in not believing a woman who says she escaped from a killer who placed her in a large hole dug in a forested area adjacent to a large city and where several other women were killed and the police perform no forensics such as examining dirt and other organic material; use search dogs or look for a pattern of missing women. They continue to be portrayed as dumb as she escapes multiple times from them pursuing her. It's not as if she's some ""Kick-Ass"" super person! So what gives? Really fragmented writing with little or no background on anyone from the killer, to the prey, to the newly hired detective who not coincidentally is portrayed as a jerk. Nothing creative in the story - same old victim escapes; is not credible to others; killer wants to finish the job; she finishes him. Acting was very good at being acting like - robotic and bland."
4,Surprisingly good,We came across this movie while browsing the available on Amazon Prime and gave it a try. It kept our attention and was an good evenings entertainment.
3,Not a great movie,Amanda Seyfried is the only good thing about this movie she is beautiful. The movie started off good but it just went down the tubes fast.
1,Gone,What a waste of time this one was. This movie should have been Gone long ago. I should have Gone (fishing) instead.
3,Gone,It's just ok. Not great but worth watching. Ending was the best part of the movie. It's closer to three and a half stars. But gave it three.
4,decent plot,Movie keeps moving. Never dull and never looked at my watch. Would recommend to a friend. Not a close friend just a friend...Just kidding!
5,awesomeness,"I admit I had low expectations for this movie. It looked like more of the same of what I had seen recently. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Never could guess what would happen next with the twists and turns. Plus suspenseful. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good thriller. Amanda Seyfried is not bad to look at either."
4,Intense,"Very good story around a very sad situation. Amanda is believable in her character and the story carries well from beginning to end. A great read or watch, I was engrossed for the length of my flight while watching this.G."
2,"Mario Party, Crash Bandicoot Style","This game is exactly like Mario Party, but in Crash Bandicoot's world. The gist of the game is you're on a map (looks likes a board game) with 3 other players, you take turns rolling the dice,and playing mini games until you've found all the secret items hidden on the map. You can play with the computers, or play with a friend who owns the game.The mini games, which use the stylus, are not thoroughly explained. The degree of difficulty for them varies greatly, which makes the game sometimes frustrating and unfun.For die-hard Crash Bandicoot fans, especially of the older games, I wouldnt bother picking this up, you'll only be disappointed. Kids who enjoy stylus games, as well as the ""board game/map"" adventures might enjoy this. (My 11 year old brother gives a thumbs up for this game)This game is a nice try, but needs work before it can fully be on the same level as Mario Party. I look forward to seeing an improved version of this game sometime in the future."
4,Cool costume,Great costume at a great price. Was missing the bandana but not sure if it was supposed to come with one. Will definitely buy more in the future.
1,Canon Powershot A460,"If I had realized how grainy and so much like the original digital cameras from the late 90s this was, I would never have purchased it. I based my decision to buy on the price and the reviews, but this camera is not suitable for anything more than a child. The pictures remind me of the square first digital cameras that came out and the grain is like the Disc cameras from the 1980s. NOT a good purchase. Pay a tiny bit more and get a Sony or another model than this one for an outstanding picture."
4,Great Budget Digital Camera Gift,"I bought this camera for my sister. Consumer Reports said that it was a great budget camera, and it's small enough that she thinks it's cool. She also liked the brushed metal front. It's been a few weeks now, and I know she's having fun with her new camera. If you want a quality digital camera without spending quite as much money, this is a good bet."
5,Don't look to expensive cameras to get quality,"I have been using my Canon A460 for 10 days now. What I can say about it is that I'm truly satisfied with my purchase. Some days before, I had bought a Canon SD1000 camera but I didn't like it and asked for a refund: too small for my fingers, seemingly too fragile for traveling around because of its compactness. I'm quite pleased with what I bought afterwards: a nice camera, fitting well in your palm, with lots of features, not too long to get used to, well laid out controls, rendering sharp and crisp photos. In some words: really inexpensive for all it can give you. A real bargain!"
3,"good pictures, power hungry","This is a good camera, it takes great pictures under almost any circumstances. Now, as almost all pocket cameras, it is not easy, much less fast, to put the menu onscreen and start choosing, so you use it almost always in automatic point and shoot mode.4X optical zoom and 4x more in digital zoom is more than most in its class.It has an unbelievable hunger for batteries, and it chews them very fast, both rechargeable or alcaline. That's its most negative aspect, and even with new ones, flash recycle takes several seconds (about 15).Anyway, the pictures are good and 5MP is more than enough."
3,"Good, basic camera","Fine camera. Does every job adequately. I purchased it with the Kingston 1 gb. Digital Flash card, and both have functioned extremely well. The camera is straightforward to use, and if you have used a previous camera, you can step right into this one without any instructions. The software that comes with it is VERY primitive. It does not rotate pictures, for instance, and exporting pictures to send as emails is cumbersome and nonintuitive. You will be glad to use earlier software if you have it. The Kingston Flash card worked without any glitches."
4,Good camera,This camera is easy to use. It was a purchase for our 18 year old son. The memory card was small so we upgraded to a larger one. Easy to load pics into iphoto. Recommend to anyone who needs a simple and good digital camera.
3,NOT FOR ME,"Item returned. I have an refurbished Kodak easyshare digital camera and the zoom lens sometimes would not function so i wanted to get a new one. After much research i decided to purchased this camera because of the good review... Not happy. My old kodak that I purchased on ebay and 3 times cheaper takes better pictures than this. The images looked good from the 2inch lcd screen but once i uploaded to my computer, pictures were not that good, not what I would expect from a canon. Also not impressed with video capability."
2,Terrible! DO NOT BUY IT!!,"I bought this camera about 3 1/2 years ago. I never liked it but it was better then nothing and a computer store was going out of business in our town and this was on sale. It takes horrible inside photos. It doesn't matter how much light you have. Your photos will either turn out very flashed, yellow, or extremely blurry. I had this camera for long enough and I tried every thing possible to create nice photos and it never did me any good. Outside photos are a little better but still sometimes blurry. I hated the thing and I am so glad I bought my Lumix :). The only plus was how long it lasted considering I have a 3 and 1 year old. Lake water is what did the thing in..Pros:Basically indestructiblequite a bit of memoryCons:Terrible inside photosHeavy!Horrible video quality (grainy and orange)Little optionsTakes a long time to take a pictureOver all this camera really sucks! I have no idea why anyone would give this 5 stars. Polaroid photos are better then this piece of crap!"
3,camera,Came in time and in great shape. Was disappointed to see the same company with the same camera for $20.00 less a week later.
4,good stuff,This is a very good camera for the price. I am completely happy with it and the quality of the pictures taken.
4,Good Camera,"I've been very happy with my camera so far. It has a distinct improvement over my Kodak EasyShare in how it handles lighting (there's a specific setting for indoors, which works great). It powers up quickly, takes crisp photos, has good color quality, and includes a lot of specialized features for what is essentially a point-and-shoot.The only drawback is that the navigation system isn't always intuitive, which can create problems for people who only need (or can only use) a simple design, but unfamiliarity can be overcome with practice. And since it allows them to include so many specialized shooting modes, I think it's a fair trade."
4,Wonderful Camera!!!,"This is a great camera for its price! It has tons of features that are fun and easy to use. It also has multiple size settings for photos, which is helpful if you wish to save space on your memory card. The smallest setting is all that is needed if you are not intending to print your pictures (i.e. if you're putting them on the web) and even at the highest quality setting for these you can still take about 55 (that's using the small memory card included)! For people printing a majority of their pictures, I would suggest purchasing a larger memory card. Batteries seem to last a decent amount of time during usage of the camera. The coloring and quality of the images seems great!"
5,my first digital camera,"I bought this camera because it had some good reviews, and the price was right. I've had it just a few weeks, but I'm in love with it. Takes great pictures, simple to load to my PC. You should buy the bigger memory card though, because the one that comes with it only holds about 8 shots. I am still learning, but have gotten some great shots. I don't usually print, but upload to York and get very inexpensive prints in a few days. I like that it takes regular AA bateries. I don't think you can go wrong with this product."
5,WORKS GREAT!,"Got this A460 to replace an earlier Canon model that I dropped. This camera is easy to use in a hurry, the pictures are sharp, easy to download, and playback. A few extra memory cards would be good to have on hand if needed."
5,canon,"for the money this is a great camera, with easy instructions, easy to use, taking great pictures"
3,Disappointingly noisy images,"I've used a Canon G3 for about 4 years, and have always been pleased with the image quality. I've tested the A460 against it in several situations and can report that:-it's faster - the powerup and shot to shot speed are excellent.-it's easy to learn and use.-it focuses better and quicker in macro mode.-The flash works well and quickly, and creates reasonably pleasing light in a variety of circumstances.-The images in sunlight or reasonably bright cloudy circumstances are fine.BUT - the images at lower light, without flash, are unusably noisy - a major drawback for me as my intended use is to take a small light camera with me on my evening walks and jogs. If low-light photos aren't important to you, it's a fine choice."
1,"Stuck Pixel from Factory, Repaired two times still same problems","Product arrived with a pixel stuck red. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I went to the desert and took some pictures of cloud formations and it was past return policy. Sent in for repair. They replaced the sensor and it came back with a different pixel stuck blue. Sent in again, the exact same pixel still stuck blue. Broken from factory, 2 repairs, and still have not taken a picture that does not have defects. I called Canon to get a remedy and I will apparently be just sending it back in and hoping the third attempt at repair will work while the other attempts did not. I would not recommend buying this unless you want to photoshop pixels out of your photos and deal with some guy from Canon who insists he does not have a Supervisor."
4,gets the job done,"Not the smallest but not too large for my purse. Takes good pictures, not too difficult to use (ie;to figure out what the symbols are without the book) comes with almost no memory so you have to buy a new memory card or you will only take about 4-5 pictures. Has plenty of potential. Works for me for impulse photos."
5,why do you have to give a title to submit your review,"Amazon makes it way TOO difficult to review a recent purchase. You should not have to set up an account or look up your password. I closed the review several times,but I continued through this process so it would not reflect on the seller. In the future I will not provide feedback until Amazon makes this process simpler. Where is the submit review button? Again, not user friendly. I am beginning to think Amazon doesn't want reviews."
3,My Food Camera,"The Macro on this camera Rocks! I keep buying new cameras to replace this one, and can't. They don't measure up in the macro. (You use the Macro to shoot small close objects, Food-Toys-Flowers.)The problem is that this camera is really slow. No one wants to wait for the camera to cycle around before getting to eat their food.Low Light is non existent. No Shudder Speed Control. I shot approx 6-8k photos between June '07 and May '08. Worked pretty good for party photos. Not so good for sports.If you can afford more, spend more. If not, you could do worse."
4,Great Little Camera,"This is my first digital camera. I've been hard pressed to give up my 35mm camera ways. This little camera is simple to use. Instructions are easy to follow. Picture quality is fairly sharp. The best part about it is that it is handy, easy to take along and lightweight...beats lugging all the 35mm stuff when all you want to do is snap a couple of quick pictures. The other thing I love which has less to do with the camera but more to do with the technology is the fact that I now don't have to print a bunch of photos that I don't want. I can print just the shots that I want and delete the rest.The one downfall to the package is the memory card has very limited space so you'll need to upgrade that really quickly.Overall for the first time users this is a good deal for a good camera."
4,like the viewfinder,"This is actually a replacement for one that I dropped in a river. I liked it enough to get an identical one. It is an inexpensive camera useful for activities (like river kayaking) that expose it to damage. A lot of cameras are leaving off the viewfinder. I find that with it, I can compose pictures better, especially in bright light, saves on battery power and is ready sooner after powering up (which also saves on batteries). If it were more water resistant, it would get the extra star."
5,Works Just Fine,"I bought the ibd starter kit. I already had a different model, older UV light. But I have had no problems using these products or getting my nails to dry. I am not a professional but I liked the ease of use so I can manicure my own nails."
2,Applies easy but turns yellowish,"I was very excited to try my own gel nails - yea, it does work good and it does dry under the UV light but after a day or so it turns into a yellow haze. And i only noticed because i ordered another brand and applied it on my ring finger. ~Claudia~"
2,LEAKS,This leaks everywhere. I've lost half of the gel from the lid leaking. Not thrilled with the fact that this happened.
1,Not good...,This product is good for nothing! Whatever time I spend trying to dry up - it just does not dry! Ever! With the help of the proper U-ray devise - doesn't!
3,Good for its age,"The ten selections on this CD were originally recorded in the late 50's and early 60's, and are from several different vinyl LPs. The material is decent enough (Frankie Yankovic is almost always superb), but Sony, alias Columbia, has the wrong idea. Instead of snatches from several albums, complete versions of Frankie's BEST albums should be re-released. From the Columbia label I recommend Friendly Tavern Polkas, Movie Time Polkas, and Polka My Way. To go back a little farther, into the monophonic era, TV Polkas and Polkas in Hi-Fi would be excellent choices. Instead, Sony has chosen to re-release only All-Time Great Polkas (Frankie's least meritorious Columbia effort ever) and Greatest Hits (already a compilation when it was first released in about 1968). Let's have some of the better ones instead. I must admit, however, I like having the title tune, The Happy Wanderer, on CD. Valderee, Valderah -- everyone remembers this one."
2,"Not ""advanced"" enough","I ordered this dictionary because I needed a ""paper"" dictionary to use during a written translation test. I generally use electronic dictionaries, but only paper references are permitted during this exam. Since I am fluent in both English and Russian, I mainly need this dictionary to provide me with deeper knowledge, secondary meanings and idioms. I checked a number of entries and in every instance the English provided was too basic and often the most obvious translation of a word. For a professional linguist, this dictionary is inadequate. For a student of Russian, in the first 2-4 years of study, it should suffice. Most colleagues have recommended the Katzner, but unfortunately the most recent edition is old! So much has happened in the Russian language since 1994. What are they waiting for? There is a clear need on the market for either a new edition of the Katzner or a new dictionary altogether."
2,Not really what I was wanted,This product is very difficult to use. The supposed russian phrases are not there. This is just a plain dictionary in 2 languages. Not at all what it is advertised as having in it!
2,"Kind of weak, especially when compared to Penguins...","Oh woes me! I lost my Penguin dictionary and had to shell out [price] for this sub-par and seriously inferior dictionary. Compared with Penguin...well there in no comparison: This one seriously lacks in idiomatic expressions, slang, synonyms and sentence examples for their words. I need to get another Pengiun dictionary fast!Why are good Russian materials so hard to find? If you're a Russian guru, make some money and alleviate this problem!!!"
3,mag,"Cool magazine but not what I exspected has lots of information if you have a c3 or c6 but if you own anything else it hardly has anything about the rest such as c1,c2,c4 or c5"
1,NOT REMASTERED,"According to the liner notes (which someone scanned and posted online), this is the SAME mastering job as on the 1996 re-release. The credits even state in this 2006 issue that it was mastered by Bob Ludwig in 1996. Yes, John Kalodner said in an interview that he and Steve Perry were updating the Journey albums to 2006 audio standards, but unfortunately that was not true. The packaging is new, but if you're an audiophile looking for updated sound, you're not going to find it, so save your money. I give one star for the pure silliness in reissuing the exact same disc under the illusion it is a sonic upgrade."
1,Here's Another 1-Star Review!,"I agree with Steve! This was simply a waste of time for Sony to even reissue this release without a fresh 2006 remaster! This seems to be a new thing for them to save money. First they threw out the Boston albums in Canada with ""remastered"" audio from a 2nd generation flat equalized source instead of the original master tapes. Now we get this!I was really hoping Sony would have spent a little money on this Journey project and put Bob Ludwig in the studio again to give us an improved sonic upgrade 10 years later! I simply don't see the point of these reissues. The 1996 reissues/remasters are still easy to find! They were good for their time, but they simply don't meet 2006 audio standards. Another lame attempt at tricking the fans and cashing in."
3,Evolution,This is not quite what I had expected. The songs on here appear to be all B sides (fillers if you will ) except for a couple songs. I thought it was the entire Evolution play list.
4,Best album Journey ever did,"This really is an excellent album. Ballads such as 'Too Late' and 'Sweet and Simple' are strong and not too mellow. 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin' is a brilliant song with a twist - listen how the girl is mocked in a thrilling finale! 'When You're Alone' is an excellent rocker. But the best part may be the three song conclusion. First the lovely melancholic rocker 'Do You Recall', then 'Daydream', alternating drowsy parts with explosive guitar bursts and soaring vocals by Perry, finally the slow rock of 'Lady Luck', with the entire band working flawlessly to end the album with a real bang.Yes, I know, their biggest hits came a few albums later, but to me this remains their best release. The album transmits real joy, energy and enthusiasm - the band are just totally loving it. Very consistent, not quite as commercial as 'Escape', but an album that will grow on you and (unlike some of their later releases) bears repetition very easily. Recommended!"
2,No bonus material.,"I give it two stars because I agree with all of the reviews that state it as a repackaged and not a re-remastered release. I suspect it's because this INFINITY and EVOLUTION have no bonus material added to them, so they got lazy and just repackaged them. All of the other Journey cd's that have the bonus material sound better than the 1996 versions, and along with the remastered Steve Perry solo cd's they are worth buying. If you have the 1996 versions of the above two cd's INFINITY and EVOLUTION don't repurchase these."
3,Deja Vu for David Bowie wanna-be...,"Of course wanting to be the next David Bowie is no bad thing, and there were moments on 'From Every Sphere' (the previous album) that Ed Harcourt reached that goal, and even surpassed it. The problem with the new offering is that there is an awful sense of deja vu about it all - and what is the story with the sound quality? It sounds like it was recorded on an answering machine....That said, there are some wonderful moments - but they are few and far between."
5,Buy This!,"All right, this review will be a bit misleading. I actually haven't received this cd yet. I ordered it about a week ago and it still hasn't arrived, which I am not happy about.... BUT...I adore the single ""This one's for you."" To listen to the FULL song go to www.edharcourt.com You will get hooked if you hear it!"
2,A HUGE disappointment.,"I have been an Oreja fan since the beginning.I don't care how the record company, the promoters, the managers, the PR people and everyone else try to spin it:This album is weak.On the Oreja scale of musical genius, here are my ratings:The music is above-averageThe lyrics are averageThe melodies are below-averageThe songs are below-averageAlthough I have to say that even a substandard Oreja album is still better than 99% of the music sold today. However, Xabi and Amaia let me down. I don't know what happened; they took their time writing and recording this album, after all. I thought it would continue their tradition of pop perfection. Oh well. Maybe they let Pablo write too much. Maybe they are resting on their laurels. Maybe they can't be perfect forever. Whatever the reason, I can't believe I have to wait another 3-4 years for the next album, because this one is certainly mediocre."
5,"THIS MOVIE, THE BEST MOVIE EVER!","Hey Whats up? I mainly wanted to see this movie because DAvid Schwimmer was in it (HE is sooo cute, or maybe ithink more than thAT!!he he he!) well i want you to dispite what thoose other people say. This movie is Down rigvht Hilarious! The Music Playing at the begining even made me laugh. (yeah the music is a lot like the water boys at the begining) Well instead of telling you about the movie, wich im not because the person before me well expained it. I tried to get all my friends to watch this movie I rented it twice! This is also two of my bestfriends fave. movies It rules their gonna get it too. Andy Dick is in it he is hilarious. David Schwimmer is sooo skinny in this movie wich i like so thats good!David Schwimmers NO. one fan Casey"
3,Loose Fit,"You don't expect a tank for less than $60 but the case seems study enough to take a drop and not get dented. The only draw back I see is that it's a bit of a sloppy loose fit for the most popular mic in history. The Shure SM58/Beta 58 ! I had to push some bubble pack into the bottom of each slot so that SM57's, SM58, Beta 58a would not move up and down when the case was shaken. Even though the case seems sturdy one doesn't want the Mic Element subjected to jerking motions when transported. The bubble back on the bottom also adds some protection as the top cover foam is nearly 1"" thick the bottom cutout is too deep and therefore only about 1/4"" of foam protects the bottom. To do it right one would have to take out the molded mic foam, cut a 1/2"" off of the bottom of it, remove the bottom foam and install a thicker one. That would be too much work. If Gator had done that I would have given it a 5."
5,It's like having a personal teacher beside you!,This book is the most complete book that I have used in my preparation for MOUS exam. It is easy to understand and contains all that you need for the exam(a certification map is included).The hands-on and exercise section both helped give me the practice I need and build my confidence.
1,Don't believe the hype!!,All I can say is that I fell into the mpg scheme. I own a 2006 Dodge 2500 diesel and it actually hurt my fuel mileage 1 mpg. My cousin has a 2006 Powerstroke and he put on a K&N and he also lost 1 mpg. The only thing the AFE did for my pickup was make the cab noise almost unbearable. Buyer beware!!
4,The best for beginners ...,"An excellent, superb introduction for devouts of the Virgin Mary, Our Lady. Very well structured, its doctrine is trully Roman Catholic. I expected a more elaborated text, more theological (Mariology) but the book is, as it states, a ""handbook"" with essentials. Some graphics and photographs would certainly help piety. Even though, I highly recommend this publication for those who want to ever glorify Our Lord and the Mother of God."
4,The Beasts of Clawstone Castle,"There really is a long-kept herd of pure bred and pure white ""wild"" cattle - you aren't allowed to go near them at all because they will become homicidal - at Chillingham castle in Northumberland. I saw a brochure for it on the way down St. Cuthbert's Walk to Lindisfarne. Fun to see them used in fiction. Lots of good takes on old faithfuls like ghosts, etc. in here, and some up-to-date statements about extreme wealth and animal care. A good one for generally good Ibbotson."
1,Bad..Bad..and HORRIBLE!,"Very unhappy abouth this order. I was looking forward to listening to David Tennants wonderful voice narrating this interresting book, but when I opened the package it was the WRONG NARRATOR AND WAS LIBRARY DISGARDED. I work in a library and the only reason they discard items is either the item is badly scratched missing a disc that can't be replaced or is unplayable."
3,An author's catharsis,"As a fan of Clive Barker, I was disappointed with this latest offering. While it incorporated some of his usual insights to life in beautifully written passages while intertwined with fantastical realms, I felt that in this book these elements were rarely and unsuccessfully interspersed in the sea of the author's personal catharsis. The story was made up of tangents without one direct course. It seemed mainly to be a very personal and real novel, but then, as if he'd meant it to be a fantasy novel or as if he realized he was getting too tangential on this level, he'd drop in elements of fantasy. It was as if he'd cut and pasted these elements of fantasy into the novel almost as an afterthought. While the analogies were made, I felt that it was an unsuccessful combination. As I said, while I appreciate Barker's writings and also the rare bits of this book that were insightful, I felt that the book overall was a disappointment."
2,Not up to Barker's standards,"I am a huge Barker fan, but was slightly disappointed by ""Sacrament"". There was a poor mix of normality and 'Barkerism'; it seemed to me that Barker was confused as to whether he wanted to write a regular story or whether he wanted to divulge into his realm of fantasy/horror as only he can do. The characters were wonderful, however. Barker has a gift of making the reader become the characters, seeing the story through their eyes. Nevertheless, this book was not up to the standards Barker set for such epics as ""Weaveworld"" and ""Imajica""."
4,Sacrament is well-written and entertaining,"Sacrament is more grounded in reality than most Clive Barker books, but it does have strong fantasy elements. If you like Barker's writing style, you will enjoy reading this book. The hero is a gay man who makes a journey to find himself, and the truth, and all that, but Barker pulls it off and entertains us with his usual inventive characters and supernatural doings. A moving, well-written book."
3,"Good book, with one bad flaw","OK, first of all I do reccomend 'Sacrament'. It was a good book, and a good read, but it just had one thing about it that I hated. I am male, and the main character of this book is homosexial, which i REALLY didn't like. Some of the homosexialatiy goes into far too much detail, making me have to read as fast as possible to where it would end. I don't know if Clive Barker is homosexial, or if all his other books involve characters that are, but I would have given this a full five star rating had if the homosexiality wasn't involved. Other than that, this book had was very good; it had very good character development from Will as a young boy into a mature adult. I also liked how Will has to discover himself and what Jacob Steep and Rosa are throughout the book."
2,Couldn't finish it!,"As a gay man I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the main character in this book was gay. However I found the plot a bit boring and not very grippihng, though after reading the reviews here I might go back and finish it. I would also like to comment on some of the reviewers who found the story good but were put off because the main character was gay. Well now you know how us gay folk feel when we read a main stream novel for the story but find it riddled with heterosexuality. Like the guy below me, I find myself tuning out the love scenes in main stream books because they simply bore me. I live for the day when all books will appeal to all readers. I thank Barker, Anne, Rice and others who write with open minds and include a diverse range of characters not carbon copies; if only most writers would write like this."
2,Wildly inconsistent in plotting and tone,"This Clive Barker effort begins promisingly, but fails to deliver substantial incentive to reward the reader. Will Rabjohns, photographer and British expatriate, suffers a coma which leads him to re-explore the pains of his extraordinary early life. The childhood flashbacks are easily the strongest points of the novel. Though haunting and bleak, this subplot is full of magical wonder, drawing the reader into the finely-rendered boyhood psyche of young Will. However, these childhood flashbacks are marred by the eventual introduction of gratuitous sexuality, though I admit this is my subjective reaction. Despite other reviewers' objections, the homosexual subtext is truly inoffensive, but what is offensive is the mundane storytelling of the adult Will's daily routine after awaking from the coma. The remainder of the novel is written without much soul. Had Barker reimagined Sacrament as a childhood story, it surely would have been a winner."
4,You know...,"Although when i finished the book ..i felt i knew what Will (the main character) was gonna lead me to think and feel ...i really needed that kind of a wake up call...Life is beautiful, but we only need to appreciate it and embrace whatever it throws on us..God, Earth and Nature are parts of us as much as we are part of them...I really did enjoy the book tremendously..the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that he was a little too graphical for my taste a couple of times..."
4,Sacrament is worth the money!,"I find it outrageous that just because this book's main character is a gay man, immediately people jump to to the assumptions that Mr. Barker himself is gay- well, so what if he is? It does not alter the fact that he is still a good writer. Sacrament, unlike his other two novels I read, (Weaveworld and The Damnation Game) is a far more credible tale, and more enjoyable. I was hoping that Sacrament would redeem Barker of his flop with The Damnation Game, and it did. A pat on the back of this Liverpudlian!"
3,Barker an exorcism of his personal life,"Having read all of his previous works, this mixture of mythical, magical and homosexual does not live up to expectations. It is a book that is never quite sure what it wants to be. Ecological champion? Homosexual confession? Mythological fanatsy? AIDS parable? . If your a Barker fan, its still worth a read, if not try reading 'The Damnation Game' first."
3,The Element,The element works great even after it was completely bent at 45 degrees when it arrived. (I bent it back) Hurricane Sandy? Perhaps.
1,So Sorry I Got this CD,"The other reviewer (as of May 2010) that offered the 5 star rating must of been on magic mushrooms when listening to this. I purchased this stupid CD on that 5 Star rating they gave.I was embarrassed for some of these artists. Spanky of Spanky & Our Gang sounded like Grandma Spanky. Ben E. King and the person singing for 'The Foundations' sound exactly the same, old and tired.Put your money away, life's to short, these re-records should not be for sale."
3,Reload Video,"This is a very informative video for those considering reloading their own ammo. It is filmed very well, with step by step instructions, as if you were actually there and the man is talking to you. I recomend if you buy this video also purchase a book as well. You will also have to check with your local laws as to even being able to reload in your state at all."
5,Shine on...,This is easily the best tablature book I have EVER come across...and I've seen and used quite a few. The very complete and precise notation of some of pink floyd's best work was done with great attention to detail. the pictures are great and capture a great time for the floyd. if you like Pink Floyd you will love this book. it's worth it just for the wish you were here tab....priceless!!!
4,NOT guitar tab,"This is not mentioned in the book info, so I'll say that it's the Piano/Vocal edition. As Piano/Vocal editions go, this one is great, usually the piano part will have the vocal part in with the piano writing, but in this book they are kept seperate.The only thing missing are the guitar solos, which are virtually nonexistant except in Shine On You Crazy Diamond (which even then loses a few instrumental parts)but it's a very good book to use to make your own arrangements."
4,Its Floyd! Of course its gonna be good.,"That being said, I do agree with the reviewer who complained about the songs not being in order. But the Roger and David interview and all the awesome pictures in it, make it all worth it.Wish You Were Here is my favorite album and its awesome to be playing my favorite songs. Buy this if your a guitar player(and a Floydian) and you won't be dissapointed."
5,Soothing and Healing,"This book is lovely and healing. The artwork is beautiful. Colored pencil drawings. The affirmations are simple, and the drawings are lovely to look at. I really am blessed to have this book."
5,"All of those wonderful, old favorites and more!","When my little girl was born, I found myself trying to remember the words to all of the songs I used to sing with my family when I was growing up. My memory just couldn't come up with some (most!) of them, though. Fortunately, this book has them all: Sweet Betsey From Pike, Oh Susanna, I've Been Working on the Railroad, Bicycle Built for Two, She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain, and so many more. What's even better is that the book also contains standard sheet music with each song, plus guitar chords, plus a brief history of each song. A great find and one I'm so glad I bought!"
4,"For fun, nostalgia and reference","This book was originally published in 1964 and includes some (now nostalgic) references to typing up and making carbon copies of lyrics and such. I don't mind that it hasn't been updated.A great collection of songs with some nice historical background. Includes very simple piano arrangements with chords identified above the piano notation, along with diagrams for chords on the guitar. Some songs are followed by words for several verses. The emphasis seems to be on encouraging everyone to sing in unison. Those who want to sing a harmony part may need to invent their own.It's a fairly thick book. I wish it came in a sturdy spiral-bound version."
1,A waste of magnetic media,"Avoid buying this one...it contains but one simple concept but drags on, and on, with no particular place to go."
3,It could be better,"I walk my dog alone at night and it's hard to see what I need to clean. This leash helps me out immensely but I only wish, it was a little longer. As far as I am concerned, that's the only fault."
4,book club companion,A good reference book for those of us in book clubs. I look forward to using them.
5,Inventive,"A very interesting look at the future to come. A scary future that is, but a future that can be changed if we have the right way of thinking...A great piece of writing. Very creative and moving. A must-read."
1,Confusing,"As with the previous reviewer, I am concerned with the barley in the ingredients. I checked Betty Lou's website and it lists different ingredients than Amazon. I hope this can get worked out so that I can feel comfortable purchasing these at Amazon's lower price."
4,Delicious and Wholesome!,"I love these, and my kids love these. Good ingredients, make for a great product! I will be ordering more."
5,Great substitute for candy bar,"I absolutely love both the Betty Lou blueberry and cherry fruit bars. Not only do they have 5g fiber - but they taste great! As a sweet freak, I have started eating these every night instead of a candy bar or ice cream."
3,"So Confused...I want to buy, but....","The confusion on the Gluten Free/Not Gluten Free is from the Product Description: (I added the ***)A wholesome, low-fat snack, Betty Lou's moist and chewy Blueberry Fruit Bars are baked to taste like a piece of pie. Made with ***organic barley flour*** and natural ingredients, these vegan-friendly bars gain their sweetness from fruit juices rather than refined sugar. With no wheat, soy, dairy, or corn, the bars provide a healthy treat free of preservatives, trans fats, and cholesterol. Betty Lou's Fruit Bars come in several delicious flavors, such as apple cinnamon, blueberry, cherry, apricot, and strawberry. Each package contains individually wrapped bars, perfect for snacking or tucking into a lunchbox.They sound like a snack my kids would love, but someone from the company/Amazon needs to update the product description to end the confusion."
1,Made my stomach turn!,"Cons:I had a few of these and they gave me severe gas and turned my stomach (nausea).There is something in these that affected my stomach quite adversely. I cannot even return them as it says they are not eligible for return!If you are sensitive to gluten or anything else that is in this , do not touch these.I wish there was a way to let Amazon know of my concern, I feel I have been had by false advertising on this product."
5,Best tree book ever!,"I beg you not to listen to any bad reviews on this gem...it's one of the best tree ID books I've ever owned! I'm an Interpretive Naturalist and it's always the book I reference when taking a nature walk. It's simple, concise, bright, clever and accurate and just about the perfect little field guide to bring along on those beautiful PA hikes."
1,Trees of Pennsylvania,"This Field Guide to the trees found in Pennsylvania is typical of a field guide that is written by an author not intimately familiar with the region. The range maps are generalized and don't accurately represent the actual distrabution of individual species as would range maps derived from research in herbariums with large amounts of Pennylvania material. The notes that accompany the descriptions are general and again don't represent an understanding of the details of the state's topography, microclimates, and general forest/woodland/tree distrabution. Not recommended."
4,"Teaching tool for parents, teachers, grandparents","It's a complex world today and kids somehow seem to have distorted notions of the value of money. It's no one's fault but many families could help themselves with this refresher course on financial basics. Stawski's ideas on how to educate kids about money make sense, whether your kids are very young or teens. This is a user-friendly book that includes worksheets you can use whether you have one kid or a houseful. Everyone in the family will benefit from this book!"
4,ANOTHER GOOD READ FROM JOHN MADDEN,"ONE KNEE EQUALS TWO FEET IS ANOTHER FINE BOOK BY JOHN MADDEN. HE GIVES US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHO HE RATES AS THE BEST IN EACH POSITION. HE ALSO OFFERS SOME TIPS AS TO WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN ANALYZING WHAT KIND OF PLAY WILL BE RUN AND HOW EACH POSITION SHOULD RESPOND. JOHN DEFINATELY HAS AN ENDLESS AMOUNT OF ENERGY, KNOWLEDGE, AND HUMOR. HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR FOOTBALL IS BOUNDLESS AND VERY CONTAGIOUS. I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR KNOWLEDABLE FOOTBALL FANS. VERY WELL DONE."
1,COMPLETE RIPOFF!!!!!!!,"After awaiting three weeks for this item, when it arrived, I was surprised to received something I didn't ordered. After following the steps to try to return it and obtain the right item, five weeks later am still stock with it. The Vendor seems to ignore my claims. I don't have the Deep Carpeted Pro Rack or my money back.Be careful when ordering this item, is not a $20 piece. Their return policies are not honored when you submit a claim, they don't care about their customers at all and it is a complete RIPOFF!!!!!"
3,NORA WIXTED,Nora is a soul-pop singer from New Orleans. TRACKS: 1. One More Reason to Go 2. Let's Play Games 3. Doin Me Dirty 4. Before the Feeling Is Gone 5. Rainy Day Leaving Song 6. Caught Up on You 7. Control 8. Backstreet Boogie 9. Last Goodbye 10. Life Is a Bitch
5,Effective demo blades,"I've used these blades for various tasks including cutting through a treated 4x4 post. Fast, clean and effective."
3,Great for price point.,"This is a great little EDC knife for the price. Under $20 w/shipping, cant beat it. It came razor sharp, but lost it's edge rather quickly with minimum use. It still serves my purposes, it is still sharp enough for what I need it for. It is easy to clean and dries fast. Feels good in hand, and is very light. I usually need two hands to open it. Will eventually get a better knife, but this one should tie me over for a good while. Looks and feels well put together. It looks very sharp too (pun intended). Someone was complaining that they could cut their finger by reaching for knife and placing finger tip inside the side holes while closed. I think that you really need to really push your finger in there purposely and hard in order to do that. Maybe on a larger model. But I do think the blade sits rather high when closed, there is plenty of room for it to close a bit more preventing this latter potential."
1,Defective,"Both DVDs were defective and couldn't be played. Be sure to save all packing materials so you can return them. I didn't so am stuck with having paid and bad DVDs. Ordered 3 sets - the Episodes 1, 2 was fine, but the Episodes 3,4, and Episodes 5,6 were both defective and couldn't be played at all. Sad ..."
5,Amateur Magician's Handbook (AMH) by Henry Hay,"This one book will open the doors of magic for you. The first two chapters are essential for the reader to understand how to create magic in the minds of the spectators. Mr. Hay is an excellent teacher and motivator. Although his passion was coin magic (T. Nelson Downs was his boyhood hero), he teaches classic sleights for cards, coins, thimbles, balls, silks, etc. He gives wise counsel on buying apparatus, how to stage a magic show, performing for children, how to practice, and more. Although the AMH was originally written in 1950, the books listed in his bibliography are still recommended reading today. I had the rare opportunity to meet Mr. Hay in Germany and he was cordial and still proficient in his hobby. Do you want to learn magic? Buy this book."
2,Panic on the streets of New York,"This book makes me think I wouldn't like Jay Mohr very much if I knew him. He comes off as a vain, desperately whining and immature crybaby who finds disgusting things funny. Though he is at least refreshingly honest about his own shortcomings,and does have some telling observations about the SNL schedule.But I couldn't shake the feeling that this book was born because Mohr heard about the Live From New York project and rather than cooperating with its authors decided to try to cash in on his own."
3,Enjoyable for the most part.,"Jay Mohr is an excellent comedian and actor. I feel this book is him telling his time on SNL as he sees it. At times he comes across as needlessly complaining, but to his credit he mentions this personality trait in the book. I left the book thinking if he wanted more airtime on the show, he should have stepped up to the plate, and brought the funny. The book definitely felt as though it was written by a novice author, but I appreciate the honesty he brought, he says what he thinks with minimum filter."
2,Entertaining but whiny,"There are a lot of really interesting, behind the scenes parts to this book but more often than not, Jay Mohr comes across as a whiny, complaning adolescent. I like Jay Mohr for the most part but this book is slightly ruined by his incessant complaining. It's an interesting look into the world of SNL and for that alone it's worth the read."
3,Less Jay Mohr,"If you remember not-watching Jay Mohr on SNL in the 90's like I didn't, you may enjoy this. An entertaining, quick read of a struggling comic who's been given many opportunities. I'm jealous."
4,Need More Mohr,"I really like Jay's fresh perspective. Being a life long SNL fan it gives one a great behind the scenes look at the shows zany weekly production schedule. This is the kind of book you can start at any chapter and read through. Fun light fare, an ideal summer read!! By any means, not 'Auspicious';-)"
5,Great book for someone interested in the inner workings of comedy,"""Gasping for Airtime"" shows the reader insights to the very closed world of Saturday Night Live. Great read"
3,A decent book,"The review from Publishers Weekly, while being somewhat on the mark, doesn't give this book enough credit. I enjoyed this book, although I had never heard of Mohr. While few of the author's skits aired, he was having better ideas his second year, and one gets the feeling that if he hadn't been so impatient he would have met success.What I really liked about the book is its feeling of authenticity. You feel as if you are there, getting the job, suffering the anxiety and witness to the SNL creative process. Also authentic is the portrait the author draws of himself, which is the main thread in the book. With all the defects that the author exhibits, he still comes off as quite likeable."
2,A so-what book from a so-what comic,"Sure, you'll get a little ""dirt"" on some SNL cast members and guests from the 1993-95 era. But mostly you'll get whining from a guy who barely made it on the air during those two years. Mohr has enjoyed a little success in the last few years, but after reading this, I give Lorne Michaels credit: he certainly has an eye and ear for ""funny,"" or he wouldn't have lasted this long. And apparently he didn't think Mohr was very funny. Turns out he was right."
2,speaking for the audio version,"not as interesting as I thought it would be but I purchased the audio version, I saw later that there were segments in the book not on the cd I received. There was no mention of Farley on the cd, so can't speak for the book , maybe it was better. There were some interesting parts about the behind the scenes stuff from SNL, but the story is told very much from just the one man's point of view so you don't get an overall feel of the show (at least I didn't) Like Jay Mohr's act just not the cd."
4,SNL? No SN-HELL!,"I always thought it would be cool to be on Saturday Night Live, be on T.V., be known across america. Now HELL NO! not anymore after reading Jay's book i have a new respect for the people ever on that show. it's good from the ""i'm going to be on SNL"" to ""when people ask me what i'm up to i don't say SNL"" find out why. It's not the best book, but it is the only book about the real SNL as a comic could only tell it."
4,Willy Wonka for the SNL fanatic,"I am so glad that someone who was lucky enough to be a part of this institution finally gave us a real ""play by play"" of how it gets done every week. Jay's account is detailed account makes you feel like you are in the building at 30 Rock Plaza with him. The best part is he writes it that way, from the access of a cast member, but through the eyes of a fan.It's more fascinating then funny, but there are parts of the book that will make you laugh out loud.The aspect of his battle with panic disorder is the other half of this compelling book. If you have dealt with it first hand, then you will relate, if you have spent time around it and didn't know it, it will explain a lot.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that he was only on for 2 years and not in many sketches, so it left me a wanting more.As you see Jay now, you wonder if SNL didn't blow it by not having utilized him more."
2,OK,"The book was a quick, simple read, good for a couple hours on the beach. I would like to read another couple of points of view before I draw any conclusions about SNL."
4,A Quick and Enjoyable Read for the SNL Fan...,"I bought this book not because I am particularly a fan of Mohr's, but because I love SNL. While Live From New York was certainly a more comprehensive, informative book on the show, this book has it's own advantages. It was very interesting to get one man's personal experiences from the show, however anguishing and difficult as they were. In telling his story, Mohr also gives us a lot of insight into the actual grueling, day-to-day process of putting this great show together. I now watch the show with a new sense of awe--how does all that chaos end up in such a great final product? I would recommend this to any die-hard SNL fan, as well as to the merely curious!"
4,Interesting look inside,"I saw Jay Mohr's stand-up special on Comedy Central and thought he was hilarious, so, when this book came out I immediately bought it expecting many laughs. It didn't really deliver that, which was disapointing. But, as you go through the book it becomes clear that it is an interesting story that is really raw and truthful. This book lays to rest all of the so-called glamour of one of the funniest shows ever created, SNL. It's a really interesting read, especially for anyone who is a fan of Jay or SNL. It is also refreshing to read about an actor and comedian's struggles in the business. I would wait for paper-back though:)"
4,"Australian scenery, horses, Fahey scenery, what more could you want?","A young Jeff Fahey is in the movie that is so well reviewed below. Kind of a sweet little movie, till our virginal heroine suddenly falls into bed after clearly establishing that she is not that kind of girl.I was surprised at the authenticity of costumes, etc. Something about horses makes any movie more majestic.It was not as strong as I would have liked. The movie business is a competitive one, and it seems a waste to put all that money and energy into something that doesn't grab you in some way and keep you watching.It's gotta be more than just the blue eyes."
3,wrangler,"Wrangler had a lovely story, and beautiful scenery. Enjoyed all performances. It was well written, with action and romance combined. I have watched it three times, and with each viewing, I enjoyed it more."
3,DVD purchase from Amazon.,I love this movie...but for some reason towards the end it won't play correctly.I've lost all info regarding sending it back...so since it wasn't costly will just keep it and not worry about it.The shipping was great and timely so it wasn't the customer service. Besides the item was used. I am sure when they test these things out they don't watch the entire disc.
4,Good TV type movie,"As a movie it was good, but one of the saving features over being on TV is no commercials, got a little more out of it."
2,Not the best movie I've ever seen,I found the movie hard to follow and it didnt have the greatest plot. I wouldnt pay $10 for it.
1,Worthless at best,"Very lousy quality, made of very cheap material, sounds horrible and it broke down about 8 days latter, seriously avoid at all cost."
1,a waste of money,I didn't expect much since the product was so cheap. The buzzing is far to much to listen past. We used it for 30 minutes.
1,"Its cheap, but...","This product is operational, but the sound quality is dismal, especially the low frequencies, the transmitter itself is very week and could not even overpower the noise that always exists on an empty band. It also confuses the iPod and freezes it. The only way to unfreeze it is to disconnect iPod from the transmitter."
5,Oustanding in every way!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It combines history with interesting narrative. It tells of the heartbreaking saga of the relationship between Jews and Germans for the 200 years preceding WW II. It spoke of histories of people and how devoted they were to the Fatherland....especially sad were the thousands of conversions, forced and voluntary, which in the end did the Jews no good. It is an enlightening read and not very flattering about the Germans and their anti semetic history of thought."
5,Profound,This well researched history of what finally resulted in what happened after 1939 is profound and enlightening. It certainly brings up the issue of minority cultures trying to assimilate into the majority culture and if that is possible. The irony is that the German Jews thought they were German.
4,Review,"The author provides all the essentials to understand the plight of Jews in Germany from 1743 to 1933. The perspective is point-of-view from correspondence and observations of Jews and Gentiles alive and writing during this period. As a personal perspective the book is well written. Although there are modest digressions from the very personal viewpoint which provides some historical context, for my purposes I would have liked a less personal and more historical viewpoint."
4,The Pity of it All by Amos Elon,"Elon's topic is the history of the Jews in Germany between 1743 and 1933. During this period many Jews progressed from deepest poverty as scorned outsiders to highly valued German citizens. With their growing emphasis on literacy and education they contributed disproportionately to what became the classical culture of Germany. Assimilation vied with Zionism, but most Jews chose to identify themselves with their adopted country. The tragedy is that this all came to a bad end with the advent of the Nazis and their racial ideologies.As a history, this book is unusually readable. Elon's method is to present many short biographies of fascinating individuals, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Heine, Mendelsohn and Rathenau are among these. This is a must read for those interested in the topic. As a German Jew myself, I found the author impartial, informative and a skillful stylist."
1,a bad purchase,"The quality of this faucet is awful. The ring on the bottom (end) of the faucet is crooked, and looks like a $3.00, Chinese faucet. Subsequently, the water always flows to the left."
5,A blessing for little ones.,This little booklet is the greatest thing for young one to try and grasp what happens when grandma or grandpap or anyone in their lives dies. A friend gave this to my grandaughter(then age 4) when her daddy died. My daughter read it over and over to her and she loved it and seemed to understand and accept why her daddy was gone. It really helped her through the grieving process.
4,Good enough for a fan in summer days...,"I don't really care some noises while I am sleeping, so this fan totally fits my needs. But if what you wanted is a whisper quiet fan, you may want to choose another product since when switching to speed 2 and 3 this fan does make a lot of noises."
5,its good!,I bought it for my medium size really hoooot dorm room for the summer.It is perfectly helping for cooling the room !
2,Great fan for two months.,"This was a great fan when I first received it in late August ('10). Very quiet and powerful, even on the low setting. But unfortunately it just bit the dust after about two+ months of using it...(Never did any damage to it, such as banging something against it or dropping it.) A shame because it was a good fan, maybe I just got a bad one, who knows."
3,"Amazon Prime - Free Shipping -Good Wind Power, Very NOISY","I got this when my AC was broken, set it in a central location in the house. It did produce enough wind to create a decent breeze, but my visitor could not get cool. All she did was complain about the heat. I had to turn the tv up much higher than normal because the fan was so loud.If I had not had it so long I would have returned it when the AC was finally repaired. It is not a BAD product, but it doesn't cool as well as I needed."
3,Nice fans but beware of damage,"I ordered two of these fans and was surprised when they arrived in two separate boxes with tons of packing paper (when they could have easily arrived in one box). The one fan works great . . . has some noise to it but thats what you expect from a box fan. The other one unfortunately had one side of it completely dented in and given the way it was packaged, I can only assume the fan was shipped dented from the warehouse. So that was a bummer but like others have said, this seems to be a common problem.Oh, and one last thing . . . one week later, i was walking around Home Depot and saw the exact same fan for $15.94 so I would have saved about $8 by just going local."
3,You get what you pay for,"This fan is not a powerhouse. I bought it to supplement my daughter's ceiling fan. The first time I turned it on, I noticed that the breeze isn't as strong as I had hoped for. We have to put the fan close to her bed in order for her to get a good breeze. If you are considering purchasing this fan, I'd only recommend it if you understand that it doesn't put out a strong breeze."
5,Great fan.,"Had a bit of a heat wave in Southern California in late 2012 so ordered two in a rush when local home centers were sold out of all fans for a 50 mile radius. They arrived very quickly and undamaged, as I was worried about given the delicate nature of the typical box fan. The fan is much thinner than the fans of my childhood, they fit well in narrow window sills be hell move A TON of air. Also are very quiet, I have a floor fan that sounds like a plane taking off, these you can barely hear on high. Overall great purchase, inexpensive and well-performing."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this fan since all three of my metal window fans decided to give up the ghost this summer. Apparently those well-made metal box fans are not to be found anymore. It works reasonably well at moving air but the pitch of the blades doesn't seem to be as well designed as the old box fans. The blades are flimsy plastic. This one works okay. Given that it is mostly cheap plastic, I wonder how long it will last. I wish someone would make those rugged metal fans again."
2,Fan arrived damaged,"Although the fan works properly, the case of the fan had a significant dent in it. The packing container is a simple cardboard box with no protective padding at all. This was purchased through Amazon using Amazon prime shipping. Not worth the hassle of returning it given that the next unit may suffer the same fate."
2,Makes lots of noise,this fan is very noising like something is rubbing inside I have had it exchanged out and the other one has the same exact noise. blows hard if you need a strong fan and not worried about sound.
4,lasko Fan,This fan does seem to provide more airflow than most. It works fine and I have seen no problems. It is the colder season here and it is not used nearly as much as in the heat of the summer. Mostly used to circulate air from central register.
3,Not really color puzzles...,"I was a little disappointed in these cards. While the majority of the puzzles are tough, they really don't have much to do with colors like I thought they would. In some cases, justification for color includes counting the number of vowels or syllables in the color names, turning it into a word or math puzzle, rather than a color one."
2,Not as useful as expected,"Kind of abstract and while somewhat interesting, did not hold any information that I found to be truly useful or intriguing."
3,Naruto Shippuden the dumb down copy,Viz Media where is the original cover art that the Japanese use for there dvd's . We miss out on the some of the greatest Naruto shippuden art ever. There are about 123 episode out in Japan so 4 episode a DVD really I'll wait for the boxsets.
4,OK Series.,"Naruto Shippuden has finally arrived in North America. Here we pick up where the first part NEVER left off in America what with it's cancelation and what not. Anyways, Naruto after a couple of years of training comes back to the Leaf Village, to the suprise of all his freinds, but not before getting punked by Sasuke.....again. Meanwhile, Garra (Now the Kazekage) falls under attack by Akatsuki member Deidara, who is after the beast that lies inside of him. This battle lasts abruptly about six episodes, so it doesn't end on this disc. The dub is overall pretty good to me, I really don't see what other people complain about the dub for, it's the same voice actors from before, just trying to sound older. The diolougue hasn't changed much either, and its overall a pretty good series. Which is why I give Naruto Shippuden Vol 1 DVD, a 4/5. Welcome home Naruto....Welcome home."
3,Needs to be longer!!!!!!,I love collecting and watching the naruto DVDs. I find the shippuden episodes more action packed. What I don't like is the fact that you only get one disc instead of three like in the earlier naruto DVDs. That means I will have to spend more money!!!!!
3,5 episodes? seriously?,"I've been waiting for this for awhile, and for them to release just 5 episodes at a time is a HUGE disappointment. This appears to be the opposite approach Funimation is taking to releasing shows (large box sets reasonably priced). Get with the program VIZ; I'll be interested when you are backing 20 plus episodes in each box set."
4,Good Movie,I love Naruto Shippuden but I must admit I prefer the Japanese version to the English version. The actor who plays Naruto in the English version makes him sound so angry but other than that I enjoyed the movie.
5,"Naruto: Shippuden, Vol. 1",I bought this for my 12 year old because he loves the Naruto show on the Disney XD cable channel. If your kid likes that show he will like this because it is the same (just earlier episodes).
4,Good Value,Great product and a good value over buying idividually. Makes quick work of 16 ga sheet metal as well as thicker formed steel. Last longer than the typical junk from HF or HD.
1,Too Small!!,"i purchased these boots because I wanted a more supportive rubber boot. They are obviously a good quality boot. They are the right length to be a size 10 but because of all the lining they are way too tight. So tight I can't use them. I bought these boots in good faith but they are no use to me. They ended up costing me about $180 delivered, I am less than impressed with this product."
5,Great Bedtime Fun,Sheep Asleep is a rollicking bedtime story that kids will want to hear over and over. It's a page-turner with a catchy rhyming text and adorable pictures that tell their own story of these playful sheep. Guaranteed to become a nightly favorite.
5,Beyond Superwoman,"I started reading BEYOND SUPERWOMAN enroute from Massachusetts. When I landed in the San Jose Airport, I felt like I knew what made the Silicon Valley click--these woman who shared their personal and professions life decisions. It is an easy, fascinating book to read."
2,Avoid audio version,"Even though read by the author, a national reporter and commentator, it is inexplicably read very poorly. Ever short ""a"" (as in plan) is pronounced as if there were a hidden ""e"", i.e. ""plaen"". The ""l"" is ""Pennsylvania"" is omitted. The word ""soldier"" is pronounced ""sojer"". Etc. It really grates on the nerves, as if the reader doesn't know how to pronounce English and completely detracts from the content."
3,Good and Not So Good,"The information about the various women was interesting. However, I had to go through the book a second time to be able to sort the facts about each woman separately in order to get a picture of what she was like. The book was so poorly organized that one reading left me with a mish-mash of impressions. I can't imagine why any editor would allow this rough draft to be printed. And I expected better of Cokie Roberts. I am reasonably sure that no one but a celebrity could get by with such a poor effort. Fortunately, the subject matter was arresting enough to carry me through the forest even though I often could not see the trees!"
2,"Let's face it, celebrity standards are lower","Would this book even have been published if the author wasn't an NPR commentator? I truly doubt it. The standards for celebrity authors are MUCH lower, even if the book is supposed to be a ""scholarly"" work, as opposed to, say, a diet book.If Roberts could pull together a few facts about a woman from the Revolutionary War period (documented or undocumented), that woman landed in the book. There was no real narrative flow.But, if it interested a few people in the Revolutionary War period that weren't interested before, well, that's a good thing!"
1,Dry as toast,"The title was all that attracted me to this book. It seemed poorly written and nobody in our book club enjoyed this book. The characters came and went and then reappeared (the book was in chronological order versus taking one character at a time) which made it confusing. It was a hard read. I actually got through another book club pick ""Andersonville"" by Kantor- almost 1000 pages with less trouble."
3,SLUGGISH,"I read this book on the advice of others who enjoyed it very much. That may have built my expectations beyond reality. In truth, I found the work mediocre. There were parts that were interesting and insightful, especially about women of whom I had never heard. Much of the book, however, was a recap of political history focused around men. I know that the genders cannot be separated, but in many respects, the direction of the writing seemed to shift away from women. Perhaps there was not enough material available to be more narrow in scope, but the best parts were the snippits of intimate details about the ladies. The prose got bogged down in wordiness that the author tried to lighten by inelegant commentary."
3,Slow Read,Bought this book to read for a book club. Found it rather slow going even though this is a noted author.
4,founding mothers,"interesting view of history.roberts style is relaxed, easy to read and imparts education painlessly."
2,Slow Going,"Interesting to a point but got bogged down in detail and never finished the book. A little too academic for me. Although the subject matter was interesting, not a ""good read.""It might be a good starting point for a history theme paper, but it is so not Cokie Roberts'original research. I was disappointed."
1,Founding Mothers,"Although this book was listed by the vendor, it was out of stock so I never got it. My account was credited, but why list the book when it isn't available.?"
4,NO DOLDRUMS HERE.,"One of the problems with history is that it's male orientated. There isn't much about our ""founding mothers."" Roberts finds most of her information in the letters and diaries of these women. At the age of sixteen, Eliza Lucas (Pinckey) ran her father's three plantations, taught her sisters and slaves lessons and wrote Wills for her neighbors. Ben Franklin's common-law wife ran his print shop and her Sundry shop while he played politics. Pamphlets were the delivery system of the colonial era and it was Mercy Otis Warren, the wife and sister of revolutionaries, who bravely published pamphlets against the British government._Founding Mothers_ is a fascinating read/listen. Those who consider history dull will discover this book has enough personal tidbits about our founding mothers to ward off the doldrums. Highly recommended for a personal read or for a school project.Brenda @ MyShelf.Com"
4,Mixed - but read it to know these women better,"Like many of the other reviewers I felt the topic was very good, but the execution could have been much better. One called out for a good editor and I believe this would have helped the book. That being said, however, I think the research and the material in this book is still worth reading, so I'm going to give it 4 stars. It's a little hard to follow in spots because of the way Roberts drifts back and forth in time, but stick it out. These women of history deserve your attention! It makes me very grateful to know more about them.Now it's time for someone, maybe one of us, to tackle their stories in a more coherent way."
2,disappointed,I found this to be a very difficult book to finish because it was not what I expected. I was hoping to read more of the letters from the women and less of Cokie Roberts. I was disappointed in this book and got somewhat bored with it. I learned more about Abigail Adams and read more of her letters from the book written about her husband and it was much more interesting.
5,Fabulous Book!!,"WOW, I loved this book. It gave me a greater appreciation for the women who lived during this time in our history. I wish our children learned more about their contributions in school, and not just the contributions of the men of the era. Entertaining as well as informative! Thank you Ms. Roberts for a wonderful book!"
4,Abigail Adams Rocked,". Besides Barbara Bush, Abigail Adams was the only woman who was both a wife and a mother of an American President. She constantly reminded her husband and colleagues to ""remember the ladies"" regarding the Constitution and Declaration. One of the most memorial references in the book is a typical male response:. Rebuffing her, implying that if women had the right to vote, they would rule the nation, and he would never submit to the ""rule of the petticoat"". She was centuries ahead of her time as were most the women in this book. I enjoyed it, but thought some of the comments by the writer were out of place. It also was a little hard to follow jumping from place to place and different time periods. Over-all it was wonderful."
4,Founding Mothers,"A fascinating look at the challenges of our founding mothers. I have never read anything that brought the understanding of what they went through, and the courage and bravery that was needed including even then being concerned about women's rights and the important of educating girls/women."
1,Great Subject Matter . . . Horrible Writing,"This book has wonderful subject matter - very interesting and even inspirational stuff about ""the women behind the men"" that founded our country. However, Cokie Roberts should be ashamed of the poor writing job. The material could have been presented in a much more coherent and interesting way. I had one friend describe the book as ""dry, old fruitcake."" I cannot say that I disagree as it pertains to the writing quality."
3,feminist revisionism?,"An interesting, though not particularly deep, look at the female relations of the men who get written about in the history books. Unfortunately, although Roberts makes much of the historical context when discussing how the women broke out of the mold, she does not give the historical context much thought when it comes to the men, leading her to be a bit harsh on the men sometimes.Perhaps a bit more problematic is that approximately the entire second half of the book is really the same story about the men that we already know, with just brief glimpses of the women. What are we supposed to take away from this? That there's only enough about the ""Founding Mothers"" to write half a book? Or that, in the end, as interesting as they were, it wasn't the women who made the history after all? Well, we probably already knew that. But this book does give a brief glimpse into the trials and tribulations of the women behind the men."
3,An Unfascinating Look at Fascinating Women,"Well intended and with too-few doses of contemporary perspective, commentary & humor, author Cokie Roberts examines some of the most remarkable women of the colonial era. Unfortunately, in her attempt to paint them as more than merely First Ladies and ""Mrs."" Washington, Adams, Madison, et al, Roberts comes up with a narrative that is often as slow going as a book report. Thorough, meticulous research doesn't necessarily deliver a good read.This important and underreported patriots deserve a livelier treatment than they get here. And Cokie Roberts could certainly have managed better. Maybe the fault lies with Editorial's fear that making them more fascinating would somehow diminish their gravitas."
3,Interesting,"Well-researched, but the facts and anecdotes are presented in 2 or 3 word phrases scattered throughout the narrative that reads like historical fiction."
5,Best Book for Jumpstarting an Interest in Rev.War.Era Women,"I just finished reading this book which was recently purchased by me at Mt. Vernon and my opinion is that it is a GOOD book! I could not dissagree more with the minority of reviewers that found fault in the author's writing style! I have read many bio's of Revolutionary-era men but never even considered reading about the ladies! This book changed all that. I loved it. I underlined so many things in this book and now I have begun reading bios of the ladies of that period beginning with Martha Washington by Helen Bryan (also sold at Mt. Vernon) which is just as fascinating as any bio of one of the ""fathers"". So, this book is an inspiration! Thank-you Cokie for opening up a whole new subject for me to read countless enjoyable pages about and which I can in turn pass on to and inspire my 10-yr-old daughter with."
4,Founding Mother,Historical novel that gives you a perspective of the birth of our nation from the viewpoint of the women of the time.
4,Founding Mothers,I recieved the book promptly. The book is in good condition. I am currently enjoying the book and it is alway nice to see history thru a woman's eyes. Thank You Cokie Roberts
2,"Poorly Written, Great Subject","I was really surpised to see how poorly written this book actually was when I read it. I had seen the History Channel special and could not wait to go and buy it. Sadly, it really turned me off on the subject because of the way it was written. I felt like I was reading more opinion than fact. I would not recommend. The story is not in sequence and is jumbled."
2,good stories ruined!!,"THE STORIES IN THIS AUDIO VERSION ARE GREAT. I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU ""READ"" THE BOOK AND NOT LISTEN TO THE AUDIO.MS. ROBERTS HAS A VOICE THAT IS AKIN TO CHALK ON A BLACKBOARD. IT IS SO GRATING AND DISTRACTING THAT IT RUINS THE STORIES.I GOT RID OF THE AUDIO AND CHECKED OUT THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY.I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY ANYTHING THAT SHE MIGHT NARRATE."
4,Kuper knows his stuff.,"Apart from a very informal writing style and a few errors like calling 1994 Brazilian presidential candidate LULU instead of LULA (Lula btw is the next President of Brazil), this book is just a jewel.He shows well how culture and society mingle with sport, in this case, soccer. He was spot on repeatedly, such as:--Holland Vs. Germany rivalry. I've asked Dutchmen about whether those comments regarding the war are true and they said yes.--Brazil vs. Argentina: he said an American journalist never saw home court advantage such as the rabid fans in the Nunez venue in the Brazil match. True again. When these two play in either country home court advantage blows away anything US sports fans are used to.And on he goes. If you are a diehard soccer fan as I am, you will love this book!"
3,Will keep your attention,"Although the beginning is a little slow, the action speeds up and the story is interesting. It's a good read. Entertaining."
4,All The Way!,This book has the thing I've needed. Mr. Ferro has a good thing going and I think this book line will go all the way
2,Too many typos for me.,The book is more of a pure PDE book and definitely is independent of Matlab.After reading the first 5 chapters I have come across so many typo errors that I have lost count!There are many interesting exercises but not enough detailed solutions showing how to solve them step by step.Overall I would not recommend buying this book.
2,Controversial advice,"In all fairness the aromatherapy world is always evolving, but I did have to disagree with some of the essential oils Mary Lee was recommending for children, especially after my own training and certification in the field. The information she writes is not harmful, just not the most recent."
2,OK for beginners,"Luckily, I borrowed this book from the library.... I would have been disappointed with it if I'd bought it. It's a nice-looking book, I like the author's writing style, loved her personal story and the personal stories throughout the book, but was left with wanting more. Way more. I did feel like it was one big advertisement for her products and very few recipes. There is some info on each of the oils, but nothing in great depth. Furthermore, I tried to find her website that features all these wonderful products and had no luck! It must have been taken down since this book was published. This book could be a good start for those new to essential oils, but if you want comprehensive, well-researched aromatherapy information, see Davis' ""Aromatherapy An A-Z,"" or Worwood's ""Essential Aromatherapy."""
4,Good Book,"I have read many books on essential oil and really enjoyed this book, although it wouldn't be the first book I would use as a reference. But would recommend it."
2,Aromatherapy Lacking,"As a person who has had an interest in aromatherapy for many years, I found this book lacking in useful information and practical recipes. There were some very inspirational stories that I enjoyed reading, but got the feeling that this book was a bit of an advertisement for the authors company. For the person who is looking for more useable information, there are too many other books out there that give more insight."""
3,A Bump In The Road,"I really enjoyed the first two Camilla MacPhee stories. So, I was really looking forward to this third adventure. I must say that I was very disappointed. I found that the ""bad guy"" was identified early on in the story. I found many of the new characters flat and wooden, while the supporting characters did grow a little. I think the thing that I disliked the most was that the author allowed her politics to enter the story. Sorry, but I'm not interested. A mystery should allow me to get away from politics, not find them. I understand that a new Camilla MacPhee story is due in 2003. I can only hope that this was just a bump on the road, rather than the future direction."
2,I give it a 3- For the travel brochure for Trinidad.,"After reading over 50 Arabesque novels, this is the first time I can say I was disappointed. The basic story of Night to Remember is a good idea, but the lack of character development left me wanting for more (like my $5.00 back!) Alana Britton is a very interesting character, but the story is told strictly from her point of view. We learn nothing about her love interest Damian. Why didn't he want to fall in love? What did he like about Alana? It takes two to make a romance and I would like to have heard from both of them."
2,Dubbed in English,The product description said the languages available were English and French.We could not view it in its original version - French/Canadian. We could only view it in dubbed English. My toddler is bilingual and we are trying to expose here to as much French as possible.
2,Not what the picture shows,"We were so happy to get one of these. We started to put it together, and realized that it was not the same fire truck as shown on the box. The ladder is completely different then what's shown on the package. Because there are different parts to the ladder not shown, it makes it difficult to identify the parts on the directions, because you'll have pieces that do not match the plans. Good luck. It's still a cute thing to have."
2,Not user friendly or useful either,This organizer has few checklist or list to fill in. It is hard to keep track of where you are at and hard to keep track of appointments. Overall not very useful. A regular day-planner would work just as well.
1,MALE FE???,"What in the world happen to this guy!? OK... theres nothing wrong with coming out of the closet but the whole album is just about that. If he values his career as a musician he needs to know how to maintain his private life and his music seperate.Manny Manuel does, and he has alot more talent than Mala Fe. Pluma Guy song was funny,Mala Fe makes his point across with humor but thats about it. The whole album is Male Fe coming out the closet party and it gets old and accomplishes nothing by it sorry bub you have just ruined your musical carrer.Good luck with what ever you do next."
3,it was ok,this book was ok but not to my liking. this book is about tasha and jared and the how she is pregnant but she tells him and that the last we hear of it. we don't read her going to the doctors or feel the baby move nothing. i feel asleep because the book was sooooooooooooooo dume. don't waist your money
2,Quite a departure from her usual style.,"The heroine has been living with the hero for two years and accidentally becomes pregnant and he proposes marriage only for her to refuse, and move out of his apartment stating that there was no love involved in the relationship. How could she have been sleeping with him for two years if they had no such feelings for each other? It calls to question their morality as a couple and irresponsibilty on the part of the heroine. The very act of making love is at the same time a silent plea to be permitted to bring a child into the world, which is why sometimes our efforts at preventing it (contraception) fails woefully. The Heroine was being extremely selfish and silly and I found her antics made the book quite boring. The hero was a steady guy and stayed true to himself to the end quite the opposite of what one would have expected. The way I saw it if the relationship was good enough for two years then it was good enough for them to stay together and have the baby."
4,A pretty good tool for drummers.,"I have this cd and I have been playing and teaching drums for quite a while. I find this product be a useful tool in the ""toolbox"". It will certainly help with your time and your fill pacing. Drawbacks are that you are only playing to bass lines and there are no melodies or builds to play off of. The songs are decent and represent a wide variety of styles. Each is about 3 min. long with a click ""in"" and a ""click"" out. The rock tracks are a little goofy but the blues, funk, and swing/samba styles are right on. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a bass player to get with on a regular basis or someone who is looking for a little variation in their practice routine."
5,Great,"This has quickly become my very favorite everyday bra. It is extraordinarily comfortable, attractive, clothing drapes well over it, and the price is low. What more can you ask for?"
2,It's alright,"I didn't really have high expectations for this product and it lived up to my low expectation. When I added the C batteries I had an extremely hard time getting them in and wound up using a tool to cram them in. It's a pretty large at 12 by 6 inches and takes about 10 seconds to reset after returning a ball. Also you have to hit the ball pretty hard for it to get up to the return, which actually negatively affected my putting game.I wound up returning the item."
1,I am disappointed in this item. It keep running after the weak return of the ball and goes through batteries too fast.,I am disappointed in this item. it keeps running after the weak return of the ball and uses batteries too fast.
5,Exquisite Prose Not to Be Missed,"Michael Cunningham is, without a doubt, one of the finest living writers we have. His exquisite use of the language, his mind-boggling insights and his complex character developments make this novel a must-read for anyone looking for quality contemporary fiction. Also check out his most recent award winner, ""The Hours,"" as well as ""Flesh and Blood."" Add him to your library at once. You will have an incredible journey no matter which of his works you choose. Aspiring fiction writers take note: no class or teacher can give you this sort of technique. Read and learn! Enjoy!"
2,"Well written, but a huge downer","This book was well written, but not enjoyable to read. The characters all seem to be marching towards their graves. All but one of the characters feel that they've mispent their lives. It was quite depressing. I had to force myself to finish it."
3,Light and Enjoyable,"Instead of rehashing all that's good with this novel (and there is a lot) I'll simply focus on its one major problem: that this novel, told from several different first-person perspectives, never changes tempo. Simply put, all of the characters speak identically. And this was disturbing. Clearly, Bobby and Claire have distinct personalities. So why was it impossible to differentiate between them?A novelist who attempts to tell his tale through multiple voices has a tough road ahead of him. In terms of storytelling, Cunningham succeeds. In terms of voice, he has a ways to go."
4,Reliving this movie!,"I lived this life, yet I was the female. I grew up in the 60's and moved to NY when I went to Art School. I lived this life, yet I knew when a relationship cannot continue. The movie is great until Clair leaves. Unfortunately she carried part of this and to me the ending was so sad and empty that I finished watching without wanting to turn off the movie! I wanted more. What happened to Bobby when you know he will be left alone, which he never wanted. Why didn't Clair at least say goodbye? I was so sad when it was over that I relived it the next day in my mind!. I adored the music and plan on getting some of it. I wish there would be another part, somehow...although life does not always have happy endings either.."
3,Good,"I read The Hours and a friend said this book was better, so I gave it a whirl. Last night I saw David Sedaris read and he said he can't review books - all that he can ever think to say is ""I like it; it was good."" That's how I feel about this book. I liked it. It was good. Isn't that enough?"
2,I had to stop reading!,"I cannot say how much I dislike this book! I hated all the chracters, especially Clare who was never anything other than self-centered. Her ""relationship"" with Bobby was nothing short of rape, not to mention the betrayal this selfish woman committed by molesting someone her best friend was in love with.The connections between the characters were not believable in the slightest and there was nothing to like about any of them. Jonathan is the sort of ineffectual, pathetic gay man that we all wish to NOT become. A main character in a book who is never happy, never driven, never willing to say what he wants or feels is pathetic.It was dismal from the beginning and I couldn't make it past the beginning of section 3. Read something good! Not this!"
2,Synopsis,"Jon was born a storyteller. His Mom lost a baby she didn't really want. Bobby lost a brother in a freak accident. They meet in Junior High. They discover each others' honkers. Jon's Mom discovers them discovering each others' honkers. Jon moves to New York City, becomes roommates with an older straight woman Clare and has a ambivalent relationship with a guy named Eric. Bobby moves in with Jon's family and learns how to cook. Bobby later moves in with Jon and Clare, then knocks up Clare in his first heterosexual affair. Jon feels left out and moves out. Jon's Dad dies in Arizona so Bobby and Clare go out there to console him. They drive back, decide they all love each other and wind up getting an old dilapidated house in the country in New York state. Eric comes to visit and has aids. Jon finds the meaning of life.Seemed overly long. Jaklak sez check it out if you're into this kind of thing. If not, keep walking."
4,A wonderful read.....,"I am in awe of Cunningham's fluid style and mastery of the English language for a contemporary novel. His description of emotions, scenes and characters is impressive; either sparse or detailed, but always spot on. Each of the four main characters literally jump out of the pages and the multi-dimensional quality that Cunningham imbues them with is the cornerstone of this excellent novel. The story spans half a lifetime but pacing is erratic in parts and the adult Bobby could do with a little more depth. This is one book that I would read again to savour the evocative writing that conjures scenes of pain and joy, feelings of expectation and disappointment, like few other works of fiction I have read. Read it and enjoy!"
2,Stick with The Hours,"I must disagree with the reviewer who recommended this book if one liked the ""macabre"" aspects of The Hours. I can hardly believe the same man wrote both books. What I think is most apparent is that he runs the same theories of the human condition in all of his books. Example: the housewife wanting to make the ""perfect"" cake, and all people just trying to get through hours. By the time he wrote The Hours, he perfected his thoughts on the human condition and as a result created a masterpiece. Granted, he writes self involved people very well, but this book lacks any kind of story. For a book that was hailed as ""character driven"", I can't say I cared about any of the people involved. The Hours moved me deeply, A Home at the End of the World left me cold and wanting to just get the the end of the book."
4,Beautifully captures our vulnerabilities and life's ugliness,"Don't waste your time watching the movie. After reading the novel, I watched the movie and wish I could erase it from my memory. I didn't love the novel throughout, but I loved it enough to give it four stars. Cunningham so accurately conveys the most painful, open-ended dilemmas life presents us and how we try to achieve at least some sense of peace with them. How he crafts the boys' families and thier internal workings is mangnificent. I found both families realistically flawed. Definitely a worthy read."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I saw the movie when it first came out and I loved it. I read many great reviews on the novel, so I decided to give it a read so I can see the similarities and differences between the book and the movie. I got half way through the novel and I couldn't stand reading it anymore. The book was too dramatic and slow-paced for my taste. The movie was great, but the book was terrible."
2,warning,"I don't know if it was just me but everything I had heard and read about this book lead me to expect a much different story. The book is not about a non-traditional family. Its about very different, somewhat disturbed people dealing with their neurosis and never really winning. I've come to find Cunningham's work pretty stark, brutal, and somewhat dark and this is by far the best example of that. If you liked the darker, macabre aspects of The Hours this is for you.In a positive note though and the reason this gets 2 stars from me - Michael is a STELLAR writer. I'm sure his shopping list is a touching piece of literature!"
5,Contemporary fiction at its best,"Michael Cunningham is a writer of such beauty and tenderness that it is difficult to imagine anyone not falling in love with this novel. The characters are so well defined and so incredibly human that their disappearance at the novel's conclusion is truly upsetting. It is warm, funny, human, telling and above all tremendously moving. Bobby's simple nature, so lovingly put forth by Cunningham, makes the character easily the most likeable, but every character in his quartette of narrating voices is vibrant and wonderful. It is the kind of contemporary novel that you want to crawl into and inhabit....and there are not many of those around today. Yes, there is one flaw: Bobby's inner voice is not much different from Jonathan's and very different from his outer voice. However, that does not distract from the overall lyrical poignancy of this novel. This is a story that will probably grab 99 percent of its readers and never let them go. It is highly recommended."
3,beautiful but left me with mixed feelings,"There is no doubt that this guy is an incredible writer. Some of his sentences are simply poetry. But, the begining of the book is so much better than the end. It tells the struggle of two adolescent boys coming to terms with their sexuality, death and the supression of life with unhappy parents (why are all this writers housewives so miserable?)Once the boys grow up, they are self involved New Yorkers with very empty lifestyles and hard to care about. The writing is still profound but when I finished this novel I found myself wishing I had known the characters better. The book is very long and goes into a lot of detail so this is a bad sign. Like spending a week with someone on vacation and returning home not knowing anything about them.I can't criticise Micheal Cunninghams writing because there are truly stunning moments here but I just wish I had understood more about what motivated the characters. Or maybe they were really as shallow as they appeared."
4,Wistful and wonderful,"A novel as beautifully written and emotionally resonant as I expected it to be. Thoroughly satisfying although not perfect. Imperfections consisted of 4 narrative voices that were indistinguishable one from the other and, for such an emotionally honest novel, a motivationally unjustified ending, one that was untrue to the characters as previously written. But by that point, Cunningham has you so in the grip of his storytelling, you are willing to forgive him anything."
4,I loved it.,"The book was a little slow-moving, at times, but beautifully written. A story about people growing in life together, written with depth and insight. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of it."
5,This isn't your older brother's comic book...,"It's much more than that. It's Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Survivor, The Real World, pop culture, media manipulation, drug addiction...This book is about people that have sold their souls to become rich and famous. They're heading toward rock bottom, but as long as they're still in the spotlight, who cares, right? Right?When these characters start to question where they've been and where they're going, you'll see that this isn't a comic book, it's a novel. In full color. With lots of nice pictures.Read it, and share it with your friends."
5,"A fine, basic introduction to a powerful program which once commanded the attention only of professionals","Autocad 2006 And AutoCad LT 2006: No Experience Required is a fine, basic introduction to a powerful program which once commanded the attention only of professionals. Any seeking to utilize the CAD software should have this manual in hand: it provides a set of tutorials which are sequentially arranged for step-by-step study - but it also can be used as an at-a-glance reference sourcebook for solving specific problems. From understanding coordinate systems and drawing routines to working with fills, text, external references and more, AutoCAD's powerful tools and drawing features are all detailed in depth."
1,goosebumps,I wouldn't read this book if it were given to me because I don't believe in evolution. We get goosebumps because we used to be hairy? come on-why aren't we still evolving?
4,fun book,"As a reference librarian, it's always fun to have confirmation that other libraries get strange questions. This is a fun compendium of popular and not-so-popular questions.That said, I am more than slightly disturbed that they do not cite their sources. I'm not saying that I doubt the answers that are given, it's just unusual that they're not not saying where the answers came from....But it's still a fun book."
1,Fraustrating mess posing as a flying game,"This has to be one of the worst games I've ever wasted $30.00 on. Problems start right from the training missions. Did the designers even consult a pilot? They kept telling me I ""left the flight path,"" yet never once was any flight path laid out or shown. It finally dawned on me that what they meant was that my plane was leaving the teeny tiny flight area of the teeny tiny map - not hard to do at all - as opposed a flight path, which is a specific vector - a straight line from point A to point B. So here I am, trying to learn how to fly this crummy plane, which has the worst flight physics I've ever encountered, and all the game designers give me is microscopic area to fly in - all the while I've got some corny ""voice actor"" screaming insults at me. Yeah, great fun. Unbelievably, the game actually goes down hill from here. Don't even waste your money renting it."
3,Bought game for husband...,"While this game is fun to play, it isn't that great of a flying game, according to my (ex)husband. He spent a few weeks/months playing this & hasn't touched it for a couple years now...needs better flight simulation."
2,You'll look pretty...crashing into the ocean!,"Okay, I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I play for fun not to be challenged. I have a day job and no longer live with my parents. So, that being said, I love the graphics and general concept behind this game but it was just too frustrating to keep at it. Let's just put it this way...it took me a week just to get through all the training missions/tutorial. Once you learn to actually fly and not crash into things, then you have to complete insanley difficult missions against enemies and all the while...manage not to crash yourself in the process. Rent it and set on ""rookie"" and if you do okay, may be worth plunking down the cash. It's a good balance between a purist flight sim and a bullet spewing arcade shooter style game. Regadless, too much invenstement of time/energy and not enough payout/sucess for me personally."
4,Great Buy!,"This is an older game for the regular Xbox and I bought it for my son for Christmas. He was absolutely thrilled with the game, and still loves it!"
3,The best of a mediocre lot,"The definitive work on the IWW has yet to have been written. If you have no real knowledge of the IWW's history, this is the best available commercial overview. This isn't to say there are many flaws in it, there are. But it does mention the IWW as an international movement. It acknowledges the IWW was a going concern in the 20s and 30s and that it continues to exist today.If you want an even better history, search out ""The IWW: it's first 50 years"" by Fred Thompson. It is tragically out of print, but is available in many libraries. This an official history of the IWW, but is a acknowledged labor classic for its honesty and even handedness. Its only weakness is its brevity because the IWW was too poor to print a larger volume."
4,Best Naval Simulation I've play so far.,"The game is a bit dated, but nobody seems to want to produce a more modern version. Fantastic for those who love the idea of fighting Naval battles."
1,straight course,This game was full of promises to me. To recreate the sorties of the Kriegsmarine in the North Atlantica attacking the Russian bound convoys was great. The graphics were outdated but no problem. However if I tried to change course the game will crash and I will be facing a blank screen. I updated it but to no avail. If you don't change courses you may end up by exchanging some gunfire with the enemy but this game is really a straight course one...
1,zodiac killer,These are overpriced and the stones-and i mean stones have no meaning of health wealth or any of the proper stones that a taures or any other sign says should be in the cheap cheap bag.
1,Unreadable,"This author is one of my favorites. I have almost all his books. But this time I was sorely disappointed. Smiths Gazelle did not interest me. I could not read it. I am sorry, because I truly like L. Davidson."
4,My first read by mr.pete,"i was weary about this book because i had never read any of his books. But this was a very interesting read, i wish though in the end it would have let u know how the two friends stayed in touch or if they even did. I recommed this book."
2,Boring,"I kept reading hoping it will get better, and finally by the last few chapters it picked. There is nothing really going on in this book. The characters weren't even interesting. I would not recommend. Don't waste your time. Took me forever to finish this book."
2,okay,"I thought ""Don't Ge It Twisted"" was just okay. I read the other feedbacks and that was one of the reason I bought the book..it was just okay plain and simple. Maybe my next novel by this author won't be as blah as this book..."
5,INFO PACKED!,"Dont think this is a field guide... it is a comprehensive collection of details regarding the mammals, their habits and characteristics and includes areas for further research. Excellent layout, easy to follow. My favorite of all my wildlife books."
5,Extremely well written and researched; a learning experience,"This book was more than I expected. Although it deals with a limited field of psychiatry, namely psychoses of schizophrenia, autism and OCD, as they relate to misuse of psychoanalysis in their treatment, the author gripped me from the start. I enjoyed the historical review of psychiatrists in the heyday of Freud, Jung, Adler, and was interested to learn of American counterparts in the mid 1900s. The description of case-histories was interesting, specifically the author's personal interviewing of these patients and patients families. In the ever evolving field of medicine, will we return to some of Freud's original theories? It will be interesting to follow. A new theory as to a possible treatment for autism using growth hormone, I believe, invites new debate. What does the author know and think about this newest treatment?"
3,not as good as expected,"Bought this battery expecting a much better performance than the factory-installed one, but after several charges (both complete and partial) it is not much better and I would even say it lasts a bit less than the factory installed battery. I will wait until other companies come up with a better, longer-lasting battery before I purchase again.The included tools worked perfectly to open the ipod without any damages (though it was a bit tricky at first)"
1,Completely awful movie,It was not the kind I like to watchtoo much psycy in the productionI would not recomend it for viewingchfancier
3,Not Bad!,"I remember buying this early last year. This Orbsessions is out takes of the last three Orb albums ever since the release of Cydonia. I did not like Cydonia too much, but this certainly makes up for it. I still heard better, but there are some good moments on this disc. The first track takes you back to some familiar sounds in ""Mummy Don't"". It gives you the feeling like your leaning over the sea of time having memories of the past.I will not go into huge detail over every single track. There are some tracks that I like and some tracks that are so, so. Not bad for an out takes disc or tracks that never made it on the last three Orb albums. It is generally a good idea to listen to it to decide rather to get it or leave it."
1,The Orb hits rock bottom,"I have been an Orb fan since ""Adventures..."". The Orb (mostly Alex Patterson) hit a creative peak during Orbvs Terrarvm, and ever since it's been a long steady decline in quality. This collection of odds & ends really provides no liner notes or info, is packaged in a cardboard sleeve & has to the worst Orb cd to date. The songs are as monotonous & unimaginitive as ambient techno can get."
1,"Dirty, scabby characters in an ugly world","I don't give many one-star reviews... Nicols misses no opportunity to endow his characters with bad breath, crusty nostrils, dirty teeth and any other repulsive characteristic imaginable, all of it described in loving detail. They wander through a nightmarish world of violence, poverty and sickness, both suffering and inflicting suffering on others, all told in a psuedo-literary style that is intended to signal us that something Frightfully Important is being related. Don't bother with it."
1,A vastly inferior Blood Meridian,"You know what this comes across as? It's as if Mr. Nicol read Cormac McCarthy's tremendous work and thought it was the coolest thing in the world, and set out to rewrite it in a new setting. His scenes, language and style seem lifted straight from McCarthy's pages, but he can't even come close to capturing the essence of regeneration through violence. That's not to say that such was Nicol's goal, because a goal is not apparent. This is a work of drivel that proceeds in jerks and spasms, and offers nothing to the literary world. Well, there is ONE good thing about it, and that is its length. Even at 200 pages, though, it's hard to get through. Why waste precious days reading this when there's so much else out there?"
2,ALL IN ALL I WAS PLEASED I DID NOT BUY THIS ONE,"I am not sure why I picked this one up at the library, not sure why I started it, and am really not sure why I finished it. I am a ""OPS Junkie"" (other people's syntax) and that is really the only thing that kinda-sorta kept me hooked I suppose. Call me stupid or dull, but I just did not ""get"" half of what the author was attempting???? I always hate to give a low rating to any book, because I know what effort goes into writing anything, and even with the really bad ones, I sort of feel sorry for the author, but in this case, it was almost as if the author went out of his way to be vague, gross, etc. Perhaps the author made too much of an effort to the Artsie. I am not real sure where the publisher was while all this was going on."
3,Wrong Item...,"I ordered this O-ring clasp on purpose, but didn't receive this item. What I got instead was a much heavier lobster claw clasp - the exact clasp I was trying to avoid because of it's weight. While the chain itself is beautiful - I'm not happy. Apparently, I can return the chain and be credited for it's cost, minus all shipping and handling charges of course!! Round trip shipping and handling cost 50% of the item charges...guess they were counting on that!! UPDATE - Customer Service has been extremely helpful!! Not only did they arrange for my return...but made certain I received the correct necklace ASAP. I am very happy with both the beautiful chain, but their Customer Service as well!! :-)"
4,The Bridge of Resilience,"Chok Hiew has connected western, more mechanistic thinking about successful human behavior with eastern, more dialectic or engery thinking by the universal bridge of resilience: the human capacity to face, overcome, be strengthened by, or even transformed by experiences of adversity. Dr. Edith Henderson Grotber, Ph.D., author, Tapping Your Inner Strength"
3,product - a necessity for a 96 year old woman,product - Ages old - still a good product.Delivery - not good.Paid for 1 day delivery. Didn't happen. How sad!!!
1,Worthless,This post-Zionist drivel will confirm the delusions of lefties and arabists who don't want to learn anything about the actual history.Study the author for insights into the masochistic omnipotence that plagues Jewish leftists and gives so much encouragement to those who want to destroy Israel.
4,A compelling story of Nation building,"Nation building like sausage & politics, is not for the weak at heart to view. This is it, this is the tale of Jews and Arabs; two peoples one land. This is the brutal story of Jews reclaiming that which was taken from them centuries ago, sadly it is also the tale of those who called the land home; haveing that land taken from them.Other reviewers have called the author a self-hateing Jew: I've seen them & I know some and I don't believe Shlaim to be anything other than a historian telling a compelling story that not all can appreciate.An excellent read."
4,Sharp and reliable history,"This is one of the most readable general histories of the Israeli-Arab conflict I've encountered. Benny Morris's _Righteous Victims_ suffers in comparison. Although Shlaim is considered a ""revisionist"" historian (meaning he uses primary sources regarding the formation of the state of Israel instead of cultivated propaganda), this book is still definitely written from an Israeli perspective. He sees immense differences between Labor and Likud's philosophies, whereas from a Palestinian perspective, they've lot just as much land and been treated with just as much contempt under Labor as they have under Likud. On the other hand, having lived and worked in the West Bank city of Hebron during the Rabin/Peres/Netanyahu years, I have to say his coverage of that period of time rings true for me."
2,A book with a definite agenda...,"I was looking for an unbiased book on the subject and a book written by a jew, yet critical of Israeli policies seemed like a good place to start. Unfortunately, the author seems to push an agenda of his own: a revisionist, ""anti-imperialist"", pro-leftist bias is evident at every turn. The author does not distort the facts. Rather, he either ""interpretes"" them (""... one can't help but conclude..."") or narrates the sequence of events in the wrong order (a reader learns about the commandos raids first, and only a couple of pages later an explanation is given that the raids were in retaliation for the murders of the civilians by the Jordanian ""infiltrators""). Some of the most ""inconvinient"" facts are simply omitted (e.g. the British ban on the immigration of the fleeing European Jews into Palestine during the Holocaust).In all, this book may give a good factual account, but it is tainted by a rather biased narration."

3,There is no such thing as an unbiased book,"This is a descent book, pointing out many aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Unfortunately, it is biased in its own way, as is every publication. It is easy to call a book unbiased, if you agree with it. But lets face it, if someone didn't have a bias, he or she wouldn't feel compelled to write a political analysis book. This book is a fine source of information and commentary, but it should by no means be the only one. It would be wise to supplement this book with books by Edward Said on one side, and Benjamin Netanyahu or Aba Eban for the Israeli side.Get as much information and then decide your position"
5,Amazing,"witty and contemporary reveals the spirit of our times.Set in the late 90's in London. The story of a chef, his friends and all the strange and unpredictable situations he gets into.A very good profile of all the characters leaves you a very electrical feeling. Best book I read this year."
2,???,"Impossible start. Fails to catch interest, sorry. Fascinated with 90's drug culture?? Is that the gimmick? Oh. sordid, maudlin interest more like. Unjustified violence isn't nice."
2,Not so fun ?,"Everyone has a different definition of ""Fun"" I guess. Some of the sites are interesting, but I hate to say I didn't add any to my favourites. I'm sure if you have a taste similar to Chris Pirillo it would be fabulous. I found that some of the sites were ambiguous and the one I loved you had to pay for :( Thats always disappointing :)"
3,meh,"I love many of Jane Haddam's books, but I find her uneven. I LOVED the previous one, Someone Else's music, but this one was dry, overly filled with factoids about conspiracy theory, and thin on emotion and relationships. Felt a bit like a political polemic..."
2,Easy read - but kind of BLAH,"The ""conspiracy"" aspect was interesting but I found that the characters were ALL very BLAND. The ""plot"" - as such - was kind of transparent - and the ""bad"" guy was one of two from the beginning. Guess I've read way too many mystery novels!!!"
2,Not sure,"The ideas are great, but not sure if they have practical application. I tried the Smoothed Adaptive Momentum Strategy and it really gives poor results, huge drawdowns for SPY, negative results with DIA, MDY, and SMH, even without transaction costs. If I optimize it for the training dataset, it performs badly on the test dataset. The Fisher Transform of normalized prices has definitely very sharp turning points, but backtesting shows the tendency to overtrade and has negative results for major indexes, without transaction costs."
4,Excellent indicators,"When you're looking for new technical analysis ideas, this book is a must. Ehlers comes from an engineering background and does a good job in explaining simple, but effective filter indicators. They give trade signals that really work.On the back side, the book is quite short. Its size is inflated by many lengthy code listings of indicator functions, in two different languages. The listings for the TradeStation would have been enough as they can be easily translated to other platforms. But most of the book is covered by listings in the clumsy eSignal language which are not really needed, or could have been provided on CD."
2,eSignal Code Fills the Pages,"I bought this book with the expectation to read some well documented mathematical work able to understand as a Mathematician with a Master's Degree in Financial Engineering. The presentation is unbelievable ridiculous. The book is pretty much filled with the lengthy code of the indicators for eSignal. The author has no respect for the reader. Instead of presenting what he has to say, if any, he just wrote a book to steal the customer from his money. Probably much needed as his personal trading systems may fail desperately. Plus the author asks $90 for a CD containing the code!My experience is that a Slow Stochastics (14,3,3) is all you need along with a couple moving averages.My biggest disappointment from reading trading books is that 99% of them are snake oil salesmanship. This book is one of them. It is just a pamphlet."
4,Bare bone replacement motherboard,"Board was used to replace an older HP ASUS made motherboard that had a slower bus speed and was slowly dying.Though the board could support a higher bus speed it had fewer accessory support. It did not have connectors for front mounted multimedia connectors, only one USB pin set and that was it.We got the HP ressurected, but the old HP board had more features."
5,What a great book!,"WoW! That is all I have to say about this book! She is so honest and tells everything, not for people to feel good for her or feel bad for her, but to help people who have problems to get over them and to tell them how God can help you through them! This is just amazing! I have both her CD's and this book(obviously) and get all her stuff! Everything is just such a blessing!"
5,The best book I have ever read!,"I got this book from Amazon.com and I started reading it that day(With Amazon it ships really fast!!!!) and I couldn't put it down, I read it all that day. It is the best book I own. She is so honest in the book and that's what made the book so great. If you want to know about Jaci's life, get the book. It is great! By the way, I am the biggest Jaci Velasquez fan in the world!"
3,Could Be Better,"A lot of weapons, ammunition, and 'scopes are not included. Important details, such as accuracy and range, are also not included. This book is suitable ONLY for very basic introduction to some sniping rifles. It is NOT suitable for serious researchers who wish detailed information."
1,Very poor!,"Mr. Hogg, I was expecting a lot more from you! This book only generally discribes some of the most recent sniper rifles. Very poor descriptions and coverage. From a title like ""The World's Sniper Rifles"", I was expecting articles on Nazi Sniper Rifles, Argentinian Mauser snipers, turret mounts, Carcano's, Enfield galilean sights, Whisper cartridges, the MacMillan models... Very poor, really. This book is just for the begginer and the person that wants to enter the field. If you are seeking the knowledge of the above subjects, search somewhere else. But hey! It gave me an idea about a book I should write and one that you should buy!! ;-)"
3,"Sturdy, but usability issues abound","We use a set of these tripods on day-long shoots several times per week. I don't expect them to break anytime soon, but we've had other problems with them:1. The feet screw in, but can't be securely locked in place --- we've lost several feet that came unscrewed (and careless crew members forgot to check).2. The locking mechanisms for the legs need to be very tight to prevent the lower segments from rotating. Once the legs are sufficiently tight that they don't rotate, it's nigh impossible to unlock and collapse them. Usually requires two people to tear down a single tripod."
2,not very pleased,could only see the image after changing the reading code was only for the usa and canadait takes a quite long time to change the country code
5,Kohler Robe Hook,Finish and fit perfect. It was also easy to install. I like that it doesn't stick out from the door too far.
2,It's alright..,"My son is 5, and on the small side for his age. This was small on him, and I was disappointed because it feels really cheap. I will just sew him a smock next time.."
2,Poor Quality,I bought it to go along with the art desk I bought my 2 year old for Christmas. I thought this would be much thicker. I was really disappointed that it was such poor quality. I could have bought something similar at a dollar store.
4,Crayola smock,"It is extremely small even on a 2 year old. For how much it costs, I would have expected something atleast a 3-5 year old could use."
1,Nothing is what it appears,"This Item is very unlike what is shown on the website, cheap looking and appears cheap made.I will not ever order anything else from this seller again."
2,Two and Under!,"I purchased this smock for our grandson for Christmas along with art supplies and was very disappointed in the quality for a Crayola product.Our grandson is 4 and not a big for year old and the smock was way to short and wide it also fits awkwardly, not a good design or well made product.Get the Melisa and Doug smock it is more expensive but one that will last."
3,Works ok,This smock is ok. It serves its purpose but I wished it would have some ties on the sides. It doesn't really wash off well either. But overall it’s ok.
3,I GAVE THIS THREE STARS,I LIKE THE PRODUCT BUT IT IS VERY SMALL. THE PRODUCT WAS INTENDED FOR 1-3 YR OLDS MAYBE HOWEVER IT WILL BE PUT TO USE WHEN MY 2 YEAR OLD PAINTS WITH HIS NEW JUMBO PAINT BRUSHES
3,Art Smock,The art smock is okay I thought it would be a little bigger. The smock is good for a very young child.
3,"Good price, but quite easy to get clothes dirty","My 12m son refused to wear a full-on sleeved smock so I bought this to ease him in gently. It's a great price so worth the gamble. He accepted wearing it quite well -although he's quite short for his age at 28"" height and this feels quite big on him.Two side ties, and one behind the neck. At the moment he is messing about with paints and crayons while sat in his high chair, so he isn't making any use of the pocket.But because of the big gaps down the sides, my son still found it easy to get his messy fingers all over his clothes. But the smock washes well, though, and air-dries really quickly.I think this would be better for slightly older children, which is good as my son will grow into it."
2,It'll work for now,"This smock works... but for a small amount of more money I couldve gotten something better and that would cover arms. This goes over the head, ties behind the neck, and under both arms. A child can NOT put this on themselves at all. It's more like an oversized bib than a paint smock. But, we are making it work until a new is bought."
2,basic poor quality,flimsy and the tie ripped on the first wearing. we still use it for a little protection but don't expect too much from this product
4,Great Smock!,I love this smock because you are able to wipe any paint right off- protects the clothing minus sleeves. Good buy!
1,Much cheaper smock - not as pictured,"Crayola seems to have changed their product, but Amazon has not updated the page. What we got is the only smock currently listed on Crayola's website (as of 1/5/13) --><...>It's much flimsier looking than what is shown here, clearly says 24months+ on the package and has no storage pockets. The design is more polka-dots and tiny-kid feeling that the artistic feel of the picture posted on Amazon.Disappointed."
4,good value.,"cheap enough-cute, lightweight and fits a 2 yr. old well enough to last at least 6 mos or more...quality above average."
3,Kinda dumb group name!,"Yes indeed Kevin, the 6:50 ""Green-Eyed Lady"" is found here, although the hit version was pretty long in itself for a pop single, something like 5 1/2 minutes as I recall. Anyone who likes that song knows this band's sound & will like this. Early-to-mid'70s organ-dominated proggy stuff, less metallic than Deep Purple and Uriah Heep, less wanky than Yes or ELP. And don't forget their 2nd & last hit, the great ""Don't Call Us, We'll Call You"" complete with CBS's phone number spelled out touch-tone style!"
2,Long version of Green-Eyed lady needs to be available as download!,"If there was ever a song that needed to be available as an mp3 download, it's the long (6:50) version of ""Green-Eyed Lady."" Unfortunately all you can get in that form is the single edit which comprises little more than half the song.So the only way you can get the full version right now is to look for either this CD or the one that combines Sugarloaf's first two albums (or most of them, anyway).Whether any of the other material on either of those discs is of interest to you is something you'll have to judge for yourself. I happened to get the ""Best Of"" CD and found that the other songs were not up to the standards of ""Green-Eyed Lady."" In fact, most of them were not even anything I cared to hear again."
3,Better than I thought,"Just got this cd, thought I would install some old 70's stuff into my collection, this cd is is better than I thought, I only remember ""green eyed lady"" as the hit, lots of the other tracks are very good considering how dated it is.Glad I have it."
4,Goes way back...,"Band evolved from Denver based 'Half-Dozen't' @ beer pub 'La Pitchet', featuring Jerry Corbeta, Randy Walwrath, Gillie Walsh, Jim Morgan & asst. drummers. A hot band to say the least."
3,Good Reading,"This book reflects how an immigrant who works hard in the USA can succeed financially and professionally. Ramos has certainly proved that=--Congratulations. It is unfortunate that even though he has interviewed leaders of other countries and see how government in other countries hold back progress of their own people and yet Ramos hesitates to call USA his home. As he acknowledges Mexico made him and USA developed him...like a biological farther who has a child yet never nourishes or parents his child but the stepfather is really the ""Father"" because the step dad has cared, nourished the child. USA has been the step father for Ramos in many ways."
3,Bad teeth,"The previous reviewer was right. The construction of the saw seems to be good, but the teeth are poorly cut. I guess they are designed to cut in both directions since they have the same amount of rake on both sides. Mine didn't cut well in either direction. The teeth also have too much set and cut too wide a kerf. They didn't alternate set on every-other tooth. They skipped a couple.I like sharpening saws, so I'll just sharpen this one the way I want it. If you don't like sharpening saws, don't buy this one.Too bad they ruined a nice tool like this with a poor sharpening job."
2,Mankind,"Mankind, as a concept would make for a fantastic game, it is a game where you start out in a huge galaxy, build a base, mine minerals, build factories, build fleets of ships, make friends, allys and enemys worldwide.I however cannot say that it lives up to it's concept due to areas of game being closed as servers go down, zero customer service, much effort to build since loading minerals, ships, and more takes many mouse clicks, this is NOT a game for anyone who has symptoms of Carpel tunnel syndrom in my view, from playing it.Presently, they have patched the game again to 1.7 and the game became unstable, they have had to totally close the game until they fix the problem, this despite ""beta-testing 1.7"" before patching the Game servers.They have a record of poorly implemented patchs.The game itself would be a five star game if it worked fully as they advertise it to be, if servers were always working, if they had any type of real customer support."
1,"Mankind, more hype than game","Do not purchase this game for the following reasons:The game is run on several servers, and they are down more than 70% of the time.Any bugs or account errors that occure during server outages are rarely ever solved or credited back to the user.Tech support, unfortunatly is not kind with american users. Any problems that are sent to vibes, receive a form letter that never addresses the problem, nor take into account the seriousness of the problemThe game involves spending hours and hours of clicking a mouse buton to load/unload ships from bases, minerals from bases. I would estimate in a 4 hour play session, you will be clicking the mouse button 6000-10000 times.And while the company touts 100,000 accounts, 80% are only demo accounts that players use as mules, non paid accounts."
3,Best AND Worst united !!,"I've been playing MK for 14 months now. What is undeniable is this game is probably based on the better concept ever seen in persistant on-line games. You fall in love with the game BEFORE you can realize the truth : the team who is supposed to run, developp and maintain the game, Vibes, is totally incompetent. Many bugs, no support at all and servers are very often closed. The players who have invested a lot of time and energy in MK are always hoping that it will one day be better, but I'm afraid it's always the same old story : many bugs, no support at all, and servers very often closed. The MK community is in hell, believe me !"
1,Where did Vibes go wrong?,"Let's make it simple, this game would absolutely rock if it weren't for the fact that you get booted off every ten minutes and that your buildings and units don't get lost every time you sign back on. I've written Vibes tech support time and time again and the only response I ever get is that they're working on the problem. You'll hear this a lot from other people who signed up with Vibes."
1,Wait a little while,"Mankind seems to have a pretty good game at it's core. The problem is that the good part of the game is having trouble escaping it's troubles. I've been playing for a while (> 1 year), and while I sort of enjoy it, it is a constant struggle. I'd say give it 3-4 months; It should be a little better by then"
2,Mankind - Always down for updates,"Mankind IS a pretty good game, when it is up and running. This unfortunately is not often enough. The company who runs the game, called Vibes, seems to be full of poor programmers and has a generally lousy technical support staff. The game involves a lot of clicking of the mouse and is constantly being patched which causes the servers to be up and down for weeks at a time. For all my negativve comments here though, I will admit I am addicted. Not sure if I will stay this way, as they have just released a new version of the game which has TOTALLY changed the entire game. The new version has been out a week, unfortunately, the servers have been down so I cannot say if it is any good. What I can say is that they reduced my credits from 2 Billion to 20 million (took me a year to earn 2 Billion) and now my cities are dying because I have 10 and the new limit is 5 and I can't get on long enough to destroy the spare ones."
2,Unfortunately NOT that good,"It is unfortunate that this title does not live up to its expectations. While initially the gameplay is rather SIMCITY'ish, it quickly dulls as you realize that the MULTITUDE of clicks necessary to accomplish any task will leave you with carpal tunnel syndrome. Coupled with the poor communications, and the fact there is little or no multiplayer interaction, UNLESS you accidentally stumble upon somone. Places this game at the bottom of the heap. MAYBE the creators will start to listen to their players and change the gameplay, ONLY THEN, will this game RESURRECT itself."
2,Up in the air,"A great game idea. Unfortunatly poorly executed, slow support, no real manual.If Vibes make an effort, it is salvageable.Not recommended for the novice player.Once they take the bugs out of the new version, a nice game. Once they actually write a manual, a great game."
4,It one of the first Online Massive Player Parallel World,"It quite a good game. Yea it don't have a lot of graphic, sounds and music. But all the features, the game style innovation and it one of the first to exist of that kind."
1,For Scholars of Russian Society Only,"This book was supposed to be a satirical look at Russian life at the end of the Brezhnev era. As I read it, though, I realized that it was largely a string of inside jokes I didn't get. It is written in a slapdash style that probably drips delicious irony for those in the know. For everyone else, is it a truly masochistic experience."
3,It's Ok,"Not much to say, you can watch the first 5 minutes after the long intro and get it. It's good for a warm up before practice."
2,meh...,"They are as advertised but I ended up not liking the hollow, light weight feel. They are slippery as well and ft I just can't get used to it."
1,Orig gave it 5 stars,"This product is made in China. Like all products made from China, you can't trust the quality and especially the likely fact that it has lead. Thanks to the other reviewer, I agree that it is not worth it. I suggest purchasing from Korea or Japan if not Made in the USA!!!!"
2,Spent too much time in the newsroom,"Perhaps Paul Hoffman has spent too much time in newsrooms... After all, newscasters' job is to unearth the seedy, the awful, the criminal, the negative. And that's precisely what you'll read in this book. Hoffman offers a mind-numbing slew of negative stereotypes (as thoroughly researched as they may be, one could also provide dozens of anecdotes to support prejudices against the Irish, Jewish peoples, Africans, Swedes...). In this book, Hoffman tries to explain EVERY reason for EVERY problem Italy has EVER experienced--from littering and crotch-scratching to poor governmental structure to tax evasion. It's as one-sided a book as any of those awful ""I bought the most beautiful house in Tuscany and had the most beautiful time with the most beautiful people"" travelogues... just replace the word ""beautfiul"" with ""bad."""
1,A lot of stereotypes,"Also if I am Italian, I don't think that we must undervalue Italian's faults; but this book is a list of stereotypes (altought brilliantly narrated) that don't help to know Italy and the Italians."
1,Dreadful distortion--real title: Everything Wrong with Italy,"I found this book to be absolutely dreadful. I kept wanting to throw it against the wall, but waiting for it to turn around. It never did. It is a rant about everything ""wrong"" with Italy. In the very last few pages, he acknowledges that Italians say they would never want to live anywhere else. But does he explore why? No. I even had my sister read it--married to an Italian, and had lived there for years. She had the same reaction. It's not like what he narrates is entirely wrong (though some is); it's just not anywhere near a complete picture. It's as if you started to look at your beautiful beloved to find all the flaws--they're there, but do not constitute the overwhelming experience. The title and introduction seem pasted on. And the anti-South stuff--just awful. This book is going straight to the recycle bin--not donated to the library."
1,Why bother?,"Paul Hoffman's ""That Fine Italian Hand"" is perhaps the most mean-spirited, humorless and unrewarding book that I have read in years. I can't imagine why he ever bothered to write a book about a people and a nation that he appears to despise so thoroughly. (Let alone why he chose to live there for so many years.) Save your money and keep it out of the hands of this bitter, bitter man."
3,"Great idea, too little follow-through","The beauty of the Beastly is touted as hailing the sort of animals that usually get little play in popular natural literature; the slimy, scary, creepy-crawlies are supposedly given their long due respect. That sounds great, and I was excited at first to learn about them. The problem is that, besides a few chapters, Angier doesn't really address those creatures. She spends a huge amount of time on DNA, she interviews scientists about their careers, she informs us of an interesting theory on menstruation. She discusses fat, vegetables, a silly diversion about old world painters....The problem isn't that these things aren't interesting, it's that they don't fit this book. Or maybe the reviews don't fit it.Somewhere along the way, Angier goes from a great idea about the beastly, and winds up writing about...everything.The chapters about the animals are quite interesting and easy to read, but don't expect a lot of it."
4,ITS A GOOD CD,"ive read on other reviews that people didnt like this cd but its a good one. it might not be the best but its not the worst. people are sayin that he cant sing and he talks about his body parts and hes worst than eminem. well everybody has their own style and his style is ho-wop. Eamon said that it is a mix of du-wop and hip hop. i bought the cd the day it came out because i loved the song f**k it (dont want you back). theres other good songs on it too like all over love, something strange, girl act right, etc. hes very dedicated and i really like this cd. i just wanted to tell the people that say he isnt good that he is sighned with a recored lable that had and has some of the best people in the music business (jive) and if he wasnt any good they would not have sighned him!it is a more of a mature type of music but if you listen to it youll love it! so i recamend this to people. and one more thing DONT BE HATIN'!!!"
1,He is seriously nothing worth listening to,"On top of the lyrics; which about a woman shouldnt be allowed to be said...i realize that every (CHOKE) artist that tells a story or tries to get revenge on someone like Eminem did...sounds very bad. Nobody can do it like him.Secondly ""if the cd is called I dont want you back, then why isnt it funny when there exists a track on the cd called ""I want you so back""? how dumb is that? Funny I have to say. A good artist would never divert from his title if he has lyrics such as these built onto his product. BAAD! Dont think he will last"
4,"Alot of potential, looking forward to future albums","Eamon has talent, you can't deny that. Sure I don't want you back might be a novelty and has top 40 song all over it but for those who have listened to the whole album know that he's on to something and alot of the other songs hold up. Thanks Eamon for the great album, Can't wait to see future albums.P.S Yeah, stop hatin. Review base on talent and quality of the album. If you couldn't connect with the lyrics then shut the F*ck up and listen to the top 40's."
1,U Cant Be Serious,"Ok I Dont Want You Back Is The Worst Album in a long time and im a music fan but i listened to this in the morning on the way to school when i bought it and i couldnt stay focused on it at all, he cant rap and he can barely sing Staton Island is the bomb so i kno they got more talent than Eamon coming out of NY, Dont Want You Back Was His First And Only Single.Truly a 1-Hit wonder"
5,Great for Making Something Special from the Heart!,"This cookbook is great! I will use it for gifts for those people on your list who have been kind to you and deserve a little something. With the family getting bigger, a gift out of a jar is the best gift to give because it's not pricey and someone will always know it came from the heart!Annamaria"
2,Kinda shady,"I have been wearing this perfume for years, It smells like it, But I find it isn't lasting as long. Maybe it's my imagination?? I dunno. But also,The bottle I bought @ dept store says "" Vera wang"" and the address in NY where is was made on the bottom of the bottle, and this one did not. Which is what got me suspicious. Been meaning to go to the store to see if they ALL have it on the bottom, if so, then that would answer my question. I'm going to put it on again tmrw, and see if it fades away quickly. Will definitely try to get a refund if it's a fake."
2,perfume,"The price was definately good but it seemed the scent was off. Are these really old or what? I have used this perfume for years now and this just wasn't ""it"". Thanks."
1,Vera Wang Perfume was a Knock-off,Bought my wife this perfume for Christmas. The Perfume was a fake. Smells like rubbing alcohol.
2,Soiled Perfume box,"The Vera Wang box was soiled, it was received without manufacturers wrapper. It was to be a gift ! I endeavored to return but discovered liquids like this cannot be returned."
3,I'm very scentimental.,"I bought a .13 mini of this and I have to say it does not smell good enough to be sold for its price. It smells pretty good in the bottle, but there is also an off-putting swampy smell to it. Plus, it does not last very long on the skin. You're definitely paying a high price for just the name. This fragrance is described as being for weddings (in that case, most would only wear it once or twice), but I can't imagine anybody wanting to smell like this at their wedding or anybody else's.I gave my bottle to my mom, and even she doesn't want to wear it anymore because it doesn't last long.Bottom line: Most like it, but it's only ok to me. Certainly not worth the price."
5,My Lovely Wife Loves It!,Its a nice soft-spicey smell that my wife has loved since I first bought it for her 5 years ago. Gotta love getting free Prime shipping and skipping the lengthy line at the departments store perfume counter!
4,excellent,"excellent product at a very reasonable price, my wife loves this product. It is much higher purchased at local stores."
4,Great scent...last a long time.,"I am impressed with the scent. It is everything that I imagined, very clean fragrance that lasts a long time. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but I had a little mixup with the original shipment. It had packaging materials, samples but was missing the actual product. I contacted the seller and they sent the product right out to me. I am very happy with my purchase and will buy it again."
5,just what I ordered,"I was skeptical about buying perfume online b/c you never know what you may actually get. But I ordered this as a gift for aomeone and it was exactly as the one in the store, and a lot cheaper. Would definitely purchase scents from Amazon again."
1,sent wrong perfume,Vera Wang for women comes in two colors. I ordered the one that is more clear in color and they sent me the one that is pink in color. Can't send it back and no where to send an email to the seller so can't even get my money back. Horrible
1,Not authentic,I have been using this product for years and have purchased it a few times from Amazon but this bottle does not smell the same and is an inferior product. Perfume returns are not possible so I am stuck with it - an absolute waste of money. Too bad Amazon cannot be trusted.
1,Needs editing!,I bought this review book in order to prepare for my written boards in 2004. I found that there were numerous mistakes in the answer sections making this a very hard review manual to get through. I would not recommend this book if you are preparing for boards. I would get Chern's review manual and question and answer book for board review studying.
5,I would love to go to Ireland now after reading this!,I loved every detail and felt like I was part of this town. I liked the faery tale effected she used. It is like telling a loving tale within another story. I could not wait until the characters found their TRUE love with the a little help from a faery king. I can hardly wait for the rest of the series. Nora Roberts never fails to keep me entertained. I would have no problem reading it again before the next book comes out.
4,Enchanting read,"Nora Roberts weaves a chaptivating tale of Ireland's mystical legends. I was hooked from the first chapter to the last, as Jude Murray finds herself and her soul mate in this enchanting land. The characters are vivid, funny and endearing. I can't wait for the next book in this new trilogy."
4,Roberts Irish Airlines,What a good book is suposed to do is transport you effortlessly away from your life and into the characters lives which Jewels does wonderfully ! I could see the countryside and feel the breezes of the soft winds of Ireland. The story evolved as nicely as all of Roberts books do and gave very good incite into the lovestory that evolved. With it being mixed in with the Irish folklore it was truly one of her best. The only sad part is the wait for #'s 2 & 3 yet to come !
4,I really enjoyed this book,I have read most of Nora Roberts' books and find this one is right up there with others like Montana Sky. I really enjoyed the Irish connection here...the magic of faeries and ghosts. It was a terrific read. I think what I enjoyed most was the interaction between all the young women in the story. At times I laughed out loud. Their banter was affecting. I look forward to the next in the trilogy
4,Wade in deeper to find a wonderful story.,The story's lack of easy answers makes it an engaging tale. I enjoyed this book as well as its sequel.
5,Jewels of the Sun,"I was swept away to Ireland and into a world of romance. The legends were wonderful. It was a quick read as I had a hard time putting it down. Someday I will visit Ireland, its a must now. My only request is to make the books a little longer. This book is second only to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon."
4,Great Irish story,"you can tell Nora loves Ireland. Besides the storyline which was a page turner, the description and welcoming of Ireland was wonderful. Made you want to take a trip to Ireland and be welcomed."
3,Lighter Fare,"I know Nora Roberts is a widely read author - probably because her style is simple and straightforward. Before I read Jewels of the Sun, I had read a couple of books by Frank Delaney - a much deeper, more interesting author. So by comparison, this Roberts book pales.A couple of things stand out: Jude, the lead character, lives in a house with a ghost and seems unfazed by it - even when she first discovers it. And then the ghost appears a few times in the story, but has no interaction with Jude. Conversely, Jude has several encounters with another tortured spirit, who says he is using Jude, but we never know why.Aside from a few things left unconcluded, the book was fun reading about an Irish family that could have lived anytime and anywhere in Ireland."
3,More like 3.5 Stars,"I don't read romance that often. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that I usually enjoy other books more. I love the series ""In Death"" published under J.D. Robb, so every once in a while, I'll pick up a Nora Roberts book. I always enjoy them, I just don't usually seek them out. This was no exception. It was a really good for a romance book. I loved the Irish parts of it. Now some people I'm sure hate the Irish cliches, but in a book like this I think it's wonderful. I love the setting, the folklore, and the people. And the romance part wasn't to over the top for me. It's part of a series, but I think it works as a stand alone book as well. While the main characters in #1 are still in #2, they are no longer the focus. And I assume the same for #3."
5,Jewels of the Sun (The Irish Trilogy),"Wonderful story about Fairies, , stubborn women and love. Set in Irland, it transports you to an Irish coastal town and take you off on quite a trip. I just loved it."
5,How does Nora Robert's keep doing this? Another hit!,A beautiful tale set in Ireland that is filled with legends and love. Received my copy this morning and finished in 2 hours. A wonderful beginning to another trio of stories. The only problem with Ms. Robert's books is the waiting for the next!
5,A wonderful love story,"Nora Roberts did an excellent job in this one. Jude is such a wonderful character, and it is great to see her realize who she is and what she really wants to do. She learns how to be a friend and a lover - how to be a real person! I absolutely loved it and can't wait for the next one to come out!"
5,JEWELS OF THE SUN,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT'S PERFECT READING FOR A COLD DAY. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A WOMAN DISCOVERING WHO SHE REALLY IS. YOU LIVE WITH HER AS SHE GROWS IN HER OWN SELF ASSURANCE AND SELF WORTH. I COULD REALLY RELATE TO HER. THE ROMANCE WAS FUN AND BELIEVABLE.
1,A huge waste of time,"Well, I suppose the good news is, I read it at bedtime to make falling asleep easier. Where as a good read such as a David Balducci will keep me up for hours reading.I don't think I've read a more boring, badly written book in a very long time. It even makes Danielle Steel's rubbish look good. Go ahead and read it if you're 10 and impressionable. Pass this one up if you're an adult and like a well written thought out plot"
3,I found in boring,"When I read Nora Roberts, I usually cannot put it down. However, this book I could not pick up. I found it boring. The book is good, but not up to the caliber of her Quinn Series or her other Irish trilogy or her Dream series. I hope the other books are better."
2,Only read the first four chapters,"I purchased this book at the Airport. For the first ten pages or so, my fellow travellers noticed [to my embarrassment], that I couldn't take the smile off my face. Such humour was written into the opening paragraphs - the author must have been writing about any one of us, male or female. Right up until Aidan and Gallagher's came into the picture this promised to be a work of art, encompassing the beauty of Ireland, it's folk lore, rich and wonderful people and the history of ghosties and goblins. Unfortunately after Aidan came into the story, it became nothing but pages and pages of two people thinking about becoming intimate - no more than a basic Love Story.....which could have been written on a rainy afternoon - just to fill in the time. The two stars are for the opening pages."
3,"Sweet, but something's lacking...","This is the first of the new Irish trilogy for me. I stayed with the book, but it really didn't turn me on until the end. I think the part I enjoyed the most was when Jude makes up her mind to sell her condo in Chicago and make the permanent move to Ireland. Jude's decision that writing is what she wanted to do really showed the inspiration of a true artist. The romance wasn't what I expected, although I don't know what it was I really expected either. It just seems that I've read too many of NR's stories lately where the heroine is not ""sure of herself"" and sets out to find the real person inside. This is not one of the better books with Nora Roberts indicated as the author. It's a quick read, which is not the norm for NR either. Catch it at the library if you're a real NR fan."
3,Middle range,"Ms.Roberts has written some fabulous books (Hot Ice, Sacred Sins etc)and some uninspiring ones, this one is in the middle range. The setting is very Irish, the characters handsome but somewhat boring. The ""Born in..."" series was similar but more dramatic. I don't mind supernatural creatures slipping into a story but I'm afraid in this book they don't add to the tension."
5,"beautiful, magical...captures the true beauty of Ireland",The story was beautiful and magical. It all starts when an overworked psychology professor comes to take a break from the boredom of her life in a cottage on Fairy Hill in a small Irish village. The story is one that shouldn't be overlooked. Nora Roberts has again outdone herself.
5,"Another ""Jewel"" from Nora","Once again Nora Roberts has given us hours of enjoyment in her new novel ""Jewels from the Sun"". Her use of details and character descriptions keeps us turning the pages just to see what will happen next. Anyone who has read any of Nora Robert's books will thoroughly enjoy this book. I check my bookstore everyday for news of her next publication."
4,Mist and Mystery,There is something about Nora Roberts novels that give you a sense of security and well-being. Although this is not my favorite (try The Reef) I enjoyed the Irish setting and found the characters charming. There is a slightly strained subplot about fairy lovers but the chemistry between the two main characters and the evocative descriptions of the Irish coast make up for it. Wouldn't we all like to inherit a cottage in Ireland and meet such wonderful people? This is a good book for a rainy afternoon and a cup of hot tea.
4,jewels of the sun,I just loved this book Nora Roberts has just proven again to be the great writer that she is This reminded me again of the Donovans That I needed to read again to refresh my memory I can always read a Roberts book without ever reading the synopse
3,Not her best,Usually really enjoy Nora Roberts' books but this is not one of her best. I don't care for the mystical elements she put in this book. It's just not believable. Much prefer her other books but I'm looking forward to the next in this series.
5,A book that speaks to the heart,"Ms. Roberts has created a truly exquisite book. I've enjoyed many of her books in the past, but this surpasses them all. Jude is a character that I can relate to in all her varied moods, a sensible career woman who desperately yearns to believe in magic. Aidan is romantic, sexy, and stubborn, all the hallmarks of a great hero. The descriptions of Ireland are pure magic. This is a book you will read again and again, and discover something new about it and yourself each time."
4,"Enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable","I really enjoyed this book. It took place in a great Irish setting. The characters were very believable. However, the plotline was a little too predictable. I would have liked to have seen a few more ""twists and turns"" before the lovers got together. Also, there are some very steamy sex scenes. I personally could have stood a little more mystery there too; so, if that type of thing is ""a little much"" for you as well, be warned."
4,The first of a good series,"Starting off brilliantly, this book does manage to get bogged down in typical romantic stereotypes. However, it is well written, moves at an easy pace, and is enjoyable to the end. Up there with Nora's best attempts, and easily recommended."
2,This book was O.K. I would give it a C-.,"I have read practically every Nora Roberts out there. I usually am enchanted with her work. oops, for a while there I thought I was reading ""Enchanted"". Same book, different setting. To much detail and not enough focus on Jude and Aidans relationship. The character of Jude is virtually identical to that of Rowan in Enchanted, which I just finished reading. The secondary characters were great. I am looking forward to Shawn and Darcy's stories. The last scene in the bar was disturbing to me. Violence in the name of what? It is still violence. Not a keeper."
1,AWFUL!,"This is probably the worst writing I have ever read. The first few paragraphs are nothing but description and narrative. I know romance novels don't exactly have the best writing out there, but even for a romance novel this writing is terrible. The heroine, Jude, is unbelievable, pathetic, and silly. The hero is unreal as well and shallow and dumb. I couldn't get into the story because there wasn't much of one, and the book would stop for ramblings of conversations that didn't move the story along at all and would stall into page after page of blah blah blah. Then some more static description, then more stalls of blah blah blah. Repeat that throughout the book.I don't know how this book even got published. The entire simple story could have been told in a few pages, and still would have been terrible. Awful. I feel sorry for the trees that gave their lives for this waste."
