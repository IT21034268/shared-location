5,Superb reference!,Visual guides to German divisions are scarce and this is the best to date. It is hard to get a sense of the inherent power of a WW 2 division with out charts showing actual vehicles etc.This book is highly recommended and now needs a companion volume for Waffen SS/LW Panzer units and a further volume on Panzergrenadier divisions.Bring them on!!
2,"Optimistic in concept, poor in execution","I read this book at a time in my life where I was struggling with my perception of God and trying to find answers to the many contradictions I was coming across in my beliefs. The overall theme of this book sat well with me at the time - it presents God as a reasonable chap who, when asked about suffering or Biblical atrocities, replies with a wink and a ""now what do you think huh?"" kind of attitude.I've since come to realise that my premises were wrong from the start and that this book was in effect a mini-reformation in my contradictory world-views. In fact, it's quite lazy. It doesn't really try to justify the contradictions, it merely says ""you know in your heart that God is a nice guy and you see that there are nasty things attributed to God so just go with your heart on this one"".As far as quality of writing goes it's a total mess. Probably one of the worst written books I've ever read."
1,This book is awful.,"I felt totally duped into buying this book. It was recommended along with The God of Small Things, which is an amzing literary novel. This book seems to be self-published, full of typos and nearly impossible to read as it is so poorly written. I have no comment on the content -- I couldn't get far enough into it. This is the first time in my life I can say that I'd have been better off [using my money for something else]. If you are at all interested in this book, you should just know what you are in for. No one proofread the manuscript!"
4,Imitation is Sincere,"After I read this good book, I thought about the earlier book Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue by Neale Donald Walsch, which became a series of best-selling books and tapes & etc. Expanding Walsch's idea for a spiritual book is worthy inspiration. A sincere effort. It may very well speak to you. So if you have liked the Walsch series of Conversations with God, then you probably will like this book."
4,"Cute, but not as big as I'd like","This baker is really chic and goes w/ the retro style of my kitchen perfectly, but I should've gone with a size larger. It's so cute I want to show it off to friends, but I can't fit the main course into this dish if I'm serving more than 4. (if people want seconds, it's only good for 3 people.)"
1,A big disappointment,"If I could find the receipt, I would return this book. I can speak a fair amount of Mandarin, and I find this book a mystery. For someone who knows no Chinese, it would be pretty near worthless. First, dialogues are almost all in English and pinyin (transliterated). If you are really stuck, you want a book you can hand to your Chinese counterpart to read your question or find a reply. Second, those dialogues that are there are scattered throughout the dictionary section. For example, introductions are found under the letter ""D"" for ""How do you do?"" Who would think to look there? Third, The dictionary approach might be more useful when you have time to plan and anticipate your needs. On the fly, I doubt it is much use.I swear by the Rough Guide Guidebook to China. It eschews the annoying ""cool speak"" of the Lonely Planet series. I expected to be similarly wowed by the phrasebook. I am going to leave this one at home."
1,OH GOD NO,"My boyfriend and I watched this movie.It's weird,depraved,really bizarre,lot's of violent killings etc., But the babes in the movie were only TOPLESS - why did they not have the babes totally NUDE while doing the action scenes ? It would have made it a lot more interesting. Looks like the director/producer did not want to pay more money for full nudity.In our opinion the movie is just O.K. Not really something you would want to watch twice-or ever again.Better to just rent and DON'T buy this turkey."
3,"Oh Lord - my sick side, is showing","I guess I'm a ""poor victim"" of the Drive-In trashy cinema days when this sort of film played a lot....gotta be the white-trash in me? In the spirit of the old Hells Angels rip-off films where every biker was this raging sadist, to the fear of ""Thrill Kill"" events that can take place, it covers them all and while it was entertaining -- that little sane part of me kept cringing back..... a bit.......LOL"
2,BIT OF A GRIND,"This will seem a lot better if you've got a bong.I found this pretty dull and lifeless,cheesy.There are some good moments and actually the Bigfoot makeup is very good."
2,Dear God No... don't make me watch it again!!,"Sorry, I gave up on this one after a character in the film enjoyed a drink he called, ""Vertical Hatchet Wound."" (I refuse to go into more detail about the drink) I'm all for low budget. I'm all for over the top. I'm all for the ""so bad it's good mentality."" I am NOT all for this ridiculousness. It got 2 stars instead of 1 just based on the shear amount of boobs in the first 15 minutes of the movie alone... but even that couldn't get me to sit through the whole thing."
2,Horrible Movie,"I really need to stop buying these type of movies. The cover looks really cool. The actual movie is pretty bad. Looks like someone filmed it with their camcorder. Very low budget but what's even worse is the HORRIBLE acting. The premise of bikers going around, doing drugs, raping and killing sounds fun but it's not very enjoyable to watch."
2,Better trailer than a movie,"I'm not sorry I watched this, but it was pretty disappointing. The trailer looked so fun; I guess the movie couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. Would've been a great 25- or 30-minute short."
2,didnt last long,after not even a month of having purchased this item. This necklace has already broken. I probably should've looked at purchasing something a little more substantial and will in the future. But for this item and it's brief usage period. I would recommend you look elsewhere for better quality necklaces. Because this one isn't it by a long shot.
2,50/50 chance of success,"I purchased two of these necklaces, but the first one broke the second time I wore it. Good thing I purchased two."
4,chain,"I ordered this necklace for myself. Was unaware that 16"" was going to be so short. It is still a nice necklace though. The shipment got to me in a timely manner."
4,Thicker than I expected,"I had a hard time envisioning this as a thick chain, just because it was so short, meant to wear as a choker. I had to pound the clasp out a little bit to get my snake over it, but it stays in place nicely. I don't regret the purchase, I find that it's quality material. I would have preferred it to be just a little thinner."
2,Disappointing,"In studying this time period, my three children and I have read MANY books. I found this book to be somewhat boring in comparison to several of the books we've read so far. I felt that from what we have learned about this time period, this story was not realistic, and perhaps a little ""whitewashed"". The situations and humor seemed contrived, and the plot was simplistic. And I did think that it was preachy. We do have strong values, but we have read several books that have incorporated these values believably into realistic and exciting plots. This book was disappointing."
2,boring?,well maybe it's just me but I expect a little bit more adventure and action in a time travel romance... the story seemed to just drag on and on... i tried skipping the pages every so often in hopes of the story finally getting interesting but... nada! i think a big reason is that the main characters in the story are in love after 1-2 days. the only things that kind of keeps happening is the women run away after a fight only to be followed by their men. and so on and on.and a few other boring cliches like getting a doctor from the futur because they're pregnant... and that without building a tiny bit of suspence...although there where some funny scenes in the book where i had to laugh a little but that was the only thing i liked about it.and they want 20 bucks for this? no thanks. i'm glad i didn't have to buy this.
3,Not really necessary,This book is not really necessary unless you are unfamiliar with how a group Bible study usually goes. It offers general guidelines that are the same for each session. The only benefit I received from buying this book was that it contains the answers to the video response sheet for each week.
4,Happy with what I got!,I was very happy with how quickley I got this book and the condition it was in. Thank you!
2,What a Disappointment,"It was with excitement that I waited for this book to arrive. By the time I had finished it, I felt deflated and misled.Although I am not trying to discredit Mr. Newald, his story seemed to ring very hollow to me. Several things left me saying ""huh?"", not the least of which were his numerous references to ""other"" information he had, but preferred not to share in this tome (saving it for another book, perhaps?). These pieces of information were related to his experience ""there"" and suspicious activity ""here"" after he was returned home.For being gone,and usually conscious, for a period of 10 days on another planet (and/or in another time)the book is very short, only 193 pages.This book may be superb for the neophyte, but those with a lot of UFO reading under their belt may very well be left feeling as I did: ""Huh?"""
5,Makes a change,"Well I've read a few of these types of books, this one is different mostly because the author does not make to many judgement calls, does not pretend to be an expert or know what this is all about, I like that about the book. If the terrestrial after events really did happen, and I'm sure it would not take to much work by someone to prove that part one way or the other, if they did happen, it makes for great back up to an amazing event. Makes you wonder if the author knows more than he's telling! I think the last part about future technology is an eye opener and not a bad guess."
2,Another Abduction (Iho hum),"Since abduction books became so common, they almost deserve a genre of their own. Newald's book, while it seems to fit squarely within the tradition, is also one of the most ambitious, and the most disappointing, I have read.Coevolution relates events purported to have occurred in 1989, in New Zealand. While driving to Auckland from Rotorua, Newald is abducted by beings from a planet which once orbited earth. (Ever hear of Heaven or Nirvana? Yep, same place.) Firesign Theater used to have a routine satirizing revivalist-ET-New Age fervor, called Everything You Thought You Knew Is Wrong. And that's as good a description of Newald's bag as you'll find: those who like that sort of thing will dig it."
5,There is help for children,"I literally just completed an inpatient treatment program provided by the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago. They were very helpful in reducing the severity of my 21+ year daily chronic headache/migraine. This clinic was founded by Dr. Seymour Diamond. My son also suffers from bad migraines. Most neurologists have been hesitant to treat him because if his age. The Diamond Headache Clinic work with children without hesitation. The doctors here and this book have a wealth of information. I am anxious to apply some of the things I learned there, such as biofeedback and low tyramine diet, with my son."
4,Good Technical Book,"Dr, Diamond has put together a book full good information relating to childhood headaches. It seems the book is targeted at other Doctors as much as it is for parents. Overall this book was helpful in learning about my daughters migrains but the diary section at the end was a little hard to use. Through my research to help my daughters I found a book that works great and is simple for parent and child to use. The title is ""The Headache Detective"" by John Ricker. It's a headache workbook designed for children that is easy to follow. It is prabably a little more helpful pinpointing what is causing your child's headache than Dr Diamond's book. Both books were helpfull"
1,It Isn't Worth More Than One Cent,"Yep, that's what the previous seller foisted the book on me for. And I wouldn't pay more. Only two poems I found pleasure in: 1) ""The Butterfly Jar,"" page 1; 2) ""Hi, How are You Today?"" page 23.I suppose many of the poems that rhyme or not are an attempt at juvenile humor--or humor for juveniles. I consider the book a terrible knock-off of poems by Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky.So, I'm going to foist the same book--for one cent--onto other people who, like most former reviewers, like this stuff.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
4,"For your preteens, great reading together..","My 8 year old was feeling a bit left out when her sister was born. I was seeking something that we can do together that's meaningful, fun and brief. Reading Jeff's poetries was wonderful. Highly recommended. I think from an adult's point, the first 20 or so are the best. My daughter will disagree"
5,Great Book!,The Butterfly Jar was the book that really got me into poetry. I checked it out of my school libary 5 to 10 times. I went back to my elemtrey school (I am in Jr. High) and found the book and re-read poems that I had totally forgotten about. This is a great book of poems for people that need a bit of help in the imagination deparment.
2,Can't get enough?,"If you have listend to ""Dos Dedos..."" and want to hear more, there are a couple of cool remixes to be found here. They are fairly stripped down, but have a refreshing raw sound. However, the total worth of the cd is questionable due to the repeat tracks from ""Dos Dedos.."""
5,The Best Book Ever,"I come from Sweden but I've read the book. But the book is swedish here... It's still The Best Book Ever,can't wait till next book arrives,which I hope it will =D If you haven't read all Dark Secrets books:Don't Tell,Legacy Of Lies, you really should read them.. they're awesome !!!"
4,Not the best time to die,"This was a good book, but I'm afraid it could have been better. The ending was slightly rushed, it was less mystery and more teen social circles. But it was intresting none the less, still I personally prefer the other books in the Dark Secrets series. I hope you enjoy it if you do get it or any other book in the series for that matter. Happy reading."
5,Exciting book!!,"Jenny's sister, Liza, was murdered while she was at drama camp and Jenny went there to find out if it really was a serial killer who did it. While she's there, Jenny keeps having these visions that are like memories of what Liza saw near to the time when she was murdered. Jenny is finding more and more clues and has many suspects. She doesnt think it was a serial killer, she thinks it was someone that knew Liza, and she needs to find out because they might try to kill her next. Jenny keeps touching things that give her chills and suggest that they had to do with the murder, like a hammer that she had a vision of being the murder weapon, and sometimes she has visions when she stands in a place that Liza was. Jenny doesnt tell the people there that she is Liza's sister and subtly asks around to find out more. Will she find out who the murderer is before they get her too? Read it to find out!!"
2,3180 is a voracious ink consumer,"This printer is great looking. It prints photographs well, but they came out dark.I received it free from Apple with purchase of an iBook.I believe the reason HP 3180 is free is because it runs through ink at an alarming rate, one will end up paying for the 'free' printer in above average ink cartridge purchases.When trying to set the print quality to 'Gray Tone' in the 'Color Sync' setting, the blacks print so dark that they are visibly wet when they come out of the printer. I was unable through many different tries to get this printer to slow down on the ink output.I also had trouble with the printer 'communicating' forever with the computer. Finally, I had to unplug the printer to start over. This happened too many times."
1,Warning: you will need to edit the registry if you use MS Office 2007 and XP/Vista,"MS Office 2007 will not work properly in XP or Vista if this printer is selected as the default unless the registry is edited. Contact HP for help with this. HP says the problem was created by an Office 97 update. They were slow to acknowledge this problem, but they did eventually develop a fix, though I was unable to find it on the HP Website and had to contact Tech Support to get it."
2,"Great print quality, but crazy expensive ink","The print quality is excellent; we have even printed pictures on picture paper that we felt were worthy of framing. However, the ink goes fast. Actually, make that SUPER fast. With ink costing as much as $15/200 pages, the cost of the printer increases by $100/year if you print a moderate amount of documents. Think about it, if I print a 40 page document for work, it costs me $3 bucks to print! That's crazy. This printer is NOT recommended for moderate to heavy users. It is recommended for occasional printers and picture lovers."
1,Be prepared to change ink cartridges a lot,"It's a nice little device that works great for scanning but forget about printing many pages, since the ink cartridge will not last past 50 pages.I am now refilling my ink cartridge for color prints and getting a black and white non-HP laser printer that will actually last more than 50 pages."
4,Happy Girl,"This printer is pretty good. Set up was relatively easy. It's a little slow when printing pictures, but the quality is excellent. This is one of the best buys for the price."
3,I've had this printer for years!,"I have had this printer for quite some time and I am happy that it finally died. It guzzles ink, it is super loud, malfunctions all the time. The only feature that I didn't like about it was the ease of the Scanner. I wish I had the money to afford a great printer, but now I must look for another mediocre piece of machinery that I will hold on to for years until it will no longer work. If you have a choice look elsewhere!"
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"Trying to use this printer on a Mac with anything but standard ink jet paper is a nightmare. It gets confused and prints blank pages, or sucks up the sheet halfway and won't let it go. Never had any kind of problems like this using Canon or Epson printers. Definitely stay away from HP products if you are trying to print on label paper or thin/non-standard papers with a Mac!"
2,Great When it Worked,I've only had my printer for maybe 3 years...everything has worked wonderfully with the exception of the printing function (the most important!). It never really handled photo paper very well and now it just won't print! It keeps saying that there is a paper jam and that the ink cradle can't move. Super annoying...I would not recommend this printer!
3,"Worked great for a short while, but now it's kaput!","Length:: 2:36 MinsI got the printer for free with the purchase of my MacBook Pro laptop computer. I've mostly been happy with it, but it's ridiculous that a part I've only used twice is now broken after only 1 1/2 years (and through no fault of my own), and now I'll have to replace the device. View my video to see what I'm talking about."
3,OS X problems with this scanner,"Prints nicely. Photocopies nicely. Almost impossible to use the scanner with OS X. Plan on spending five or ten minutes per page, trying to get it to work.It will give an error that shows it doesn't recognize the printer, then five minutes later without changing any of the connections, it will recognize it. I think it is probably just buggy software.My friend has another HP all-in-one model, and also uses System X. She can't get hers to scan at all."
4,All in One - Multifunction for Ubuntu Linux,I was looking for a home all in one product to connect to Ubuntu.Linux computer. Checked the HP LP-LIP site for a list of supported devices and HP's site to see which were currently offered and found this C3180 to appear to be the best match. So I bought the box - took it home and downloaded latest HP-LIP package. The software self installed very easily on Ubuntu Feisty 7.04 ! Both printing and scanning worked first time and seamlessly for all users configured on the PC. I have not tested all features exhaustively yet - but I was very impressed by the ease of getting this compact unit to work with a Linux environment - I have had more trouble installing under XP with other hardware !So anyone needing a compact home all in one for Linux - give this one a try.
2,fair at best,"I got this printer recently for very little when I bought a Mac. That is about what it is worth. It gobbles ink like no tomorrow. The paper jams frequently. You have replace all the colored ink even if only one color is depleted. And it insists on printing a test page every time I change a cartridge, using up even more of its limited ink supply. It copies and prints decently, but I find the scanning software unweildly. I long for my old Epson!"
2,Probably the worst printer I've ever used,"This is probably one of the most difficult units I've ever worked with and I worked in the computer industry for years. I'm tech savvy and this pushes me to the limit. It's constantly making noises and blinking at me. There is nothing about this printer that seems to work ""flawless"" for me. I'd certainly go with a different printer."
4,Great little printer,"I have been using this printer for the past year and have found it to be a great little desktop printer. The quality of the documents and photos are very good and they print fairly quickly. The scanner is quite adequate for my needs although I would have liked a ""descreen"" function for scanning from printed pieces. Having the ability to read several different memory cards is great because I get a variety of them from company employees who all use different cameras to supply me with photos. I use the OCR function frequently and its pretty good although I have to take some time fixing a number of ""misreads"" but its very handy to have on my desk. All-in-all, I really like this printer."
2,Fun to smash with a hammer,"I got this printer for school, and after the first few months, it would not print in color for more than 2 days after replacing the cartridge. Plus anytime you change a cartridge, it prints a test page that uses up a lot of ink. It's loud, and would wake my roommate up in the mornings.The best thing about this printer is that it can provide great stress relief. At the end of the second year, I took it outside and beat it to a pulp with a hammer, along with a friend of mine who had problems with her printer, also an HP.Bottom line. HP printers are NOT worth the money."
1,Sh*tty!!! STAY AWAY!,"If I could sum this product up in one word...well, I think my title covers it. Lets see, where do I begin:1: Software (which is neccessary for scanning) does not work with Vista. I cannot get the thing to scan. I've tried every solution out there and nothing works.2: Print quality sucks! I tried printing some photos that I took with my Canon 8 MEGAPIXEL camera and they all came out dull, lifeless, and the color was nothing like what I saw on my computer screen. Everything has a red tinge to it!3: Sucks up ink! I just got this thing yesterday and I printed a few 4x6 photos and 1 8x10 photo and I've already used half of my color cartridge. What a waste!I cannot WAIT to return this thing to the store tomorrow! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Print head,"One big problem with this printer is that it won't print if even only one of the 4 ink cartridges is low or out of ink. The print head, which failed on mine, is very easy to replace. You don't have to take the whole thing apart."
1,It's great when it works......,"I have had my printer since January. Intially the printer worked, but within a couple of weeks it would print strange characters or give error messages while printing, messing up the document. On a good day it might print two to three documents before sending error messages and spewing out junk. If I attempt to cancel the job, it grabs more paper and prints more garbage! It is a great product when it works, otherwise don't waste your money on this lemon!"
5,HP Photosmart C3180 All in One Printer/Scanner/Copier,"Love this! Have bought 5 printers in the last 15 years to go with upgraded computer purchases ... this is my fav! Fast, good quality copies, prints and scans."
3,Uses Too Much Ink,"The reasons for my low rating are two. First, you will run through a black ink cartridge quickly. Second, There is not a way to print in ""Draft"" mode to conserve ink. All fonts appear to print in bold."
5,Awesome printer and excellent price,"I compared this to the printers on the market at 200$ and above and i dont see any difference. this printer was 70$ including the shipping. it does'nt get any better than that. It's fast , quiet and is a solid product."
1,HP C3180 Simply Doesn't Work!,"Don't waste your money. After a gazillion hours of trying every HP software, driver, re-install, and Windows XP trick imaginable, the only way it would work was to install a generic driver to print basic copies, which the HP Update software promptly tries to remove and replace with the defective ""official"" device driver. And THEN, even then, you get about 40 copies before it says your $20 print cartridge is empty.You can bet my experience has made it extremely unlikely that I'll ever buy anything from HP again."
3,Great printer but HP is making huge bucks on the ink!,"Nice printer, works great, but it's probably my last HP. The cartridges that you have to use with this one are the 92 and 93. There is very little ink in these cartridges it's either 5 ml or 15 ml (1 teaspoon or 1 Tb). It goes incredibly fast. The cartridges are cheaper, but you buy a lot of them.To remark on the previous comments- there is an piece of plastic that swings out and has a little flap that goes up and this provides a platform for the papers to land on. The idea behind this printer is compactness.As for the print head on the cartridges--that's why the cartridges are $20 or more--the print head is on the cartridges. I have steered away from Canon because you have to replace the print head, but now am considering it. I have heard that you get alot of use out of the printer before that happens. So my next printer will be either an Epsom or a a Canon."
5,Very good printer,"This printer is a simple, yet quality device. It has the print quality you expect from HP and easy operation of scanner/copier functions. The ink replacement is a bit tight to see what you are doing if you are unfamiliar with the HP ink snap in procedure. But, the price was right and the quality is there"
5,HP photosmart all in one printer,"My college aged daughter's printer died and she needed a replacement right away. I checked out this one and bought it for her. The price could't be beat, she received it right away and it works great! This is even better than the old one which was only a printer. With the 3 in one she can scan in articles and make copies too! A great deal for the money!"
2,Poor Performance overall,The scanner and provided software was very dissappointing. The colors are very faded and did not provide any software to clean up the image manually. The printer worked adequately.
4,:),fast shipping:) looks good on my desk! ty! but next time... hp!!! add the usb cord it needs... i had to spend a extra 27 dollars to just hook it up... other wise good... ty.
1,Worst printer from the worst company,"I too got this printer for free when I bought my mac. And even still I think its a horrible waste. It worked well for a few months; i probably printed about 20 times and only a few weird paper jams, etc. But after a few prints the ink will run out! I've never seen ink run out so fast. Now I can't print anything. it will print a couple of lines on the first page, and then print gibberish and symbols on the next page, and then just keep printing a few symbols on a new page. Its so frustrating. I tried to re-download the drivers but to no avail. The customer service at HP is some of the worst I have ever used. And tried to charge me $65 to tell me that the printer is broken. I'd rather take that money and buy a new printer. Which I will. And never from HP (worst company ever)."
3,Good Printer- Gulps Ink,This printer is pretty good except it doesn't just use ink- it gulps ink. I have spent a fortune in color ink cartridges for my small home-based business. Better off to buy an Epson with individual ink cartridges.
1,HP has software bugs on their printers,Read the forums at HP support before you even think of buying an HP printer. It's not an all-in-one. It's a 2 in one. It prints and copys but it won't scan. And if you look on those forums you'll see a whole host of people who can't get their various HP all in one's to scan.I have 2 and they worked fine unitl recently. Now all of a sudden the computer doesn't recognize the scanner portion of the thing. Everything else works great. Unfortunatly scanning is important when you run a business.
1,I despise my printer,Every time it is turned off or on it decides to waste more ink by printing an unwanted test page. Wont print from my laptop arbitrarily (despite the laptop claiming to have it connected and the drivers installed). I'd rather hang myself than buy another hp printer.
2,Not recommended,I received this printer free with the purchase of an iMac desktop computer. I have found it to be buggy and difficult to use.
1,printer eats ink,"Printer has many problems,the worst of which is how it consumes ink.Cost over 35 cents a page for black. I never tried color as I have adedicated photo printer. Paper jams, sucking in multiple pages,and printing non requested test sheets, are the reason I stopped usingafter 4 months and went out and bought a laser printer."
1,"Terrible, endless headaches esp. with Mac",This thing is horrible. Insists on printing a test page every time it's turned on. Endless trouble printing from my Macbook (running Leopard). Usual horrible bloated HP software. Avoid!
1,Worst printer I ever had,"Besides being a giant, loud printer, it's lousy. Always pulling through too much paper, jamming itself, and the expensive ink lasts all of 2 weeks. This printer put me off of HP for good."
1,INK USAGE IS INSANE!,"I've been using this printer for about 3 months and have gone through 3 ink cartridges. I don't print more than maybe 50-75 pages a month. At around $13 (at the cheapest) a cartridge this is insane. If I hadn't gotten the printer as a gift this would be a terrible investment. I could print for years (2500 pages) on a laser cartridge for $50. For the price, buy a laser printer and never look back! I'm warning you don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Great MFP with one major flaw,"I've owned this printer for about a year and a half. It was a great performer for light to average home use but has one major flaw. The available ink cartridges only have 5ml of ink which barely last a month even with light use.After going through my last two ink cartridges this fall, I decided it was a better investment to buy a new MFP. I paid $79 for a new Canon MP470 which included 16ml ink cartridges (and has high capacity cartridges available when it is time for a refill). It would have cost me almost $50 for two 5ml black and one 5ml color cartridge for the HP. For $30 more, I got the equivalent of 1 extra black cartridge, 2 extra color cartridges and a free printer to go with it.I understand HPs motivation but 5ml cartridges is just an insult. If I was aware of this when I was buying the printer, I would not have done it. BEWARE!"
1,HP 3180 Printer,"I really am disappointed in this used printer. I realize I was taking a chance, butit is most frustrating to print 2 copies, then have a red light come on, indicating aproblem, so I just turn it off for a few minutes, then try again - only to print 2 copiesand it repeats the warning. Probably will not purchase another used printer. Money rightdown the drain."
1,Watch out for your wallet!!!,"I bought this printer and I think the best place for it is a trash bin.The print is OK, the software functions but is not real user friendly. The worst issue is you get about 10 color pages before you have to replace the cartridge. The black cartridge isn't much better. The cartridges cost less but compared to my old printer I will have to spend about $100+ dollars more for just either color or black cartridges. This printer isn't even worth 1 star. Stay Clear of this one."
3,Had some trouble.,"Let me say first that I'm a senior who learned about computers late in life, and I'm not real good at it. But I try. I have an e mac and really like it but the hp printer I had before this one was so much simpler that I needed more instruction with this one. I installed it okay but had trouble communicating with it through the computer. With help, I think it's okay now. I wish hp would give a few more detailed suggestions for working with a Mac. And I also had trouble using a printed paper, (one with a 3 in. design on the top) to print a christmas letter. It kept rejecting it and saying it was the wrong size, which it wasn't. (The old printer accepted it just fine.) It copies and prints beautifully, I don't have a digital camera yet so haven't tried that. I suppose as I learn more about these machines things will improve."
1,dont do it,"I have had this for years, it's the worst printer I ever had.I have had to hassle with it far more than even an old fussy dot matrix, lining up the papersthe first thing i noticed was the paper feed, it sucks them all at once, lots of jams, the ink jets get clogged easywastes a lot of ink to clean them, ink smudges too easy on prints, even though they have tried to improve this with the inkits a photo printer, some nice features, but print quality is not great, even with the best paper/inkthe software is temperamental, nice free programs but really a hassle to print, wasted so much business card stock and so many hours trying to make this thing work right I wish I had a time machine to go back and buy anything else but this."
1,Don't buy this printer,"In all my years of using printers at home and at the office, I have never had more trouble than with this printer. I have reloaded software multiple times, moved the printer to a brand new computer, and loaded all the HP fixes until I'm blue in the face. After all that, if you simply run out of paper, or print one copy, every attempt to print afterwords is garbage! Forget about printing pictures! The only use we get out of this printer is to make simple copies -- very slowly!"
2,Horrible,This thing is horrible. It has a lot of paper jams. Working with this is so frustrating that I usually only use it as a backup as I have other printers I work with. The only good thing about it is the copier in my opinion. This will be the last time I buy a HP printer.
4,price change,"I purchased this printer Jan.11, 2007 and have been very happy with the the product but shocked at your price change. I paid $99.99 two weeks latter I see your price is only $66.00 (-$33.99) Office Max alao advertised it Jan.14 & jan. 27, 2007 for $84.99"
3,"Looks cheap, but it's actually expensive.","Although this printer looks cheap, it's actually very expensive. If you tend to type a lot and print a lot, you're going to find out that the black ink runs out pretty quickly and although there is an indicator of how much black ink is left, it's very unreliable since you won't be able to make good prints when the ink is lower than 1/4 full. The cartridges are extremely expensive considering the low amount of ink it contains and over a span of 1 year, you'll find that you will have probably spent another 100$ on buying ink for this printer.Quality wise, it produces clear and great prints and the scanner works very well.3/5 stars."
4,great product,"It's a great printer, but the original setup was a bit confusing. It would have gotten a 5 if it weren't for that. It prints great quality and the scanner works really well. I am definetly pleased with this purchase."
3,"Nice, expensive printer.","For 3 1/2 stars:The scanner is awesome! The photo card-to-PC upload is excellent. The copies are accurate & crisp. The printer prints very nicely. However, it appears to guzzle ink at the blink of an eye. I do not recommend it for college students, unless you plan on keeping extra ink around at all times. A few drafts of your paper will mean running to the store for more ink. For this reason, I don't even recommend it for photo printing, as you can get nice prints from the store without all the hassle. I recommend Canon printers. I used to buy ink for them maybe once or twice a year. For my HP, in half a year, I've already changed the cartridges twice! This printer also jams paper if it has too much humidity in it. It has trouble grabbing one page at a time with humidity. I never had that problem with my old Canon."
4,Good product overall,"I would say this is a good product except when I first got it, I could not get the printer and copier function to work. The scanning result was ok, not the best. But it's very helpful if you just need it for a document backup. I e-mailed HP customer support and then everything miraculously started working just fine. I would recommend this product."
1,piece of junk,"The software takes forever to install and the device itself is of cheap quality. The first day I used it, the paper jammed. I tried to clear it as per instructions and the roller bar broke. I am very disappointed."
4,Excellent printer for the price,I had an ealier version of this printer that worked well but since it was set above eye level in my armoire office the buttons on top were a big problem. Every time there was a glitch I had to get a stool and flashlight to check it out. My new one is easier to get to since it is on a lower shelf but I still wish they were on the front. The print and photo quality is great and the scan quality is amazing. I have't figured out how to scan slides yet but my husband probably knows. Fine machine for the money.
4,Good Printer,"I bought this printer for my father's birthday. He is a photographer and is just getting into the ""digital"" age. I wanted to get him something he could use at home, maybe not professional quality, but still decent. The printer works really well, we are very happy with the quality of the prints and we've used it for scanning and copying and it does a good job. I like the fact that you can get the ink almost anywhere and it's not very expensive. We looked at several printers and this one seemed like the best compromise for the money and were pleasantly surprised by the actual quality-it was better than expected. It is not as loud as I thought it would be and has only had one paper jam all the times we've used it. I especially liked the 3 memory card slots in the front because you don't have to have your computer on to make prints(but it does help if you want to make really good ones)and it will just print you an index card of all your pictures."
2,Too much ink consumption,"The printer is great with good speed, quality. Built-in scanner is wonderful. Everything is great and a normal person should be very happy with it. However let you be warned: this printer eats ink at a speed so fast you will feel you are living at the Bestbuy printer ink shelf.Minus the sacarsm, i could only manage to print approximately 30 pages of FAST DRAFT before the black ink level dropped to almost zero-, and much less with normal or better quality for DOCUMENTS printing.If you have money to constantly buy ink to fulfill this beast, then all recommendation on this wonderful printer-scanner. If not, and printing documents is your main concern, you have much better luck (and plenty of bucks saved) trying other printer."
4,Very good three-in-one,"The printing is very good quality and sometimes the copies are better than the originals! The colors are brilliant and very true to the original image. Have't tried printing photos yet.I've had some difficulty with margins--sometimes the printer leaves a little off the right side. Also having some trouble understanding all the directions for scanning and therefore have trouble getting it to do what I want. This may not be the fault of the manual, but my lack of time to really study it."
4,Great little number,"It prints brilliantly. For the price, you wont find a better printer/scanner/photocopier."
1,Disappointment,"I have been very disappointed in this machine and can't even get back-up help from HP. I can not get the computer to communicate with it when I want to enlarge, etc from the computer though I can print out e-mails and pictures working from the computer. The machine itself does not have the capacity to enlarge, etc. The original ink cartridges only lasted a few weeks with very little printing being done. All in all it's a dud!!!"
1,Even though I got it for free it was not worth it,I got it for free after rebate but I have never gotten it to work.I hate printers.I will be taking a hammer to this piece of garbage shortly.All in all a horrible product.
1,Scratched,This product like others have indicated was scratched. It is not a scratch that would occur from shipping but scratches are of the nature of manufacturing problems or from someone using it as a demo. I have a feeling that the supplier or seller providing Amazon these units are selling inferior Brabantia manufactured items.Save yourself the time and hassle and skip the purchase. I should have listened to the rest of the reviews online.
1,Not worth it,Bread keeps getting bad. Can't use it anymore. Best way to keep bread fresh is to keep it in refrigerator. No need for breadbox.
1,Damaged,Arrived scratched in two spots. I returned it easily for a refund. Should have listned to some of the reviews that had the same thing happen
2,Damaged in Shipment,"The bread box was damaged in shipment. It didn't look like it was packed for mailing. Also, it appeared cheap and flimsy."
2,Bread Box,"The Bread Box is smaller than anticipated. It does not appear to be a ""full size"" bread box. In addition it was not properly packaged when shipped. It arrived with the box partially open. There is a large scratch in the middle of the front lid of the bread box . I have not returned it because I did not want to incurred the additional shipping cost.I am disappointed because the bread box was expensive. Should receive an adjustment because of the scratches."
3,just don't quite have it....,"Only useful if you're desperate for some Buffy tales. The writer, Pascoe, just doesn't have the characters down. He tries to reflect their quirky dialogue, but it's painfully forced. Art is important in comics, but if the writing isn't there, it doesn't matter. Just not very impressive, and I'm a huge Buffy fan...."
5,Best of Late Mumford,Mumford was pretty conservative (in the traditional not neo-con sense) in his later years. This is a strong analysis of the decadence of the second half of the 20th Century. One should be well grounded in early works by Mumford to get the full value of this book.
3,Butt vs. Shaft,"I only put the cue wax on the butt of my cue stick (the pretty part), not the shaft. It sounds like the other reviewers here are putting this product on the shaft. I don't think that is such a good idea. There are other products specifically for the shaft that work much better.My 2 Cents..."
4,"Bright enough for most tasks, very sturdy.","It's a very handy and capable light. I keep mine by my keys and grab it whenever I go out at night. Doesn't have a lot of range, but it's great for any kind of close range work. I actually ordered the red LED, which was shipped from HDO sports through Amazon, and after much ado, they sent me this light instead. I ordered the red through another site, and got it for a much better price than it's listed on here, and still kept this light for general utility, rather than for wheelhouse watch - where I need the red.I'm very impressed by it's durability, and I've owned dozens and dozens of flashlights over my career, carrying a compact light of some form nearly every night for the last twelve years. This one is all business. Minus one star not because of what it is, but because of what it isn't: A combination red/white would have been ideal but there hasn't been a good one available in the US since Sanyo stopped making the Cadnica rechargeable light."
2,"Heavy, but dim.","An ugly, heavy, but very dim flashlight offering.Seems well made. The design leaves a lot to be desired.Not anywhere close to worth the money!Look elsewhere."
3,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION,"Why advertise this light as the military version and then ship the civilian version? I understand the price is the same and overall it's still a great little light, but this is NOT the military version as advertised. Why do that? That's not a good selling tactic."
3,Not Excited About This Light,"I was dissapointed in the light output. Might be useful over a short distance but not very btight. About the same as one of those Photon key chain lights. Also, the product description indicates the light has three color outputs but it only produces white light. I have a Gerber 22-80124 Omnivore LED light $23 that is MUCH brighter but it is bigger. I bought the Gerber Infinity Ultra because of the small size and price but I'm dissapointed in the performance."
1,Never Recieved,"I was told UPS lost item, then was offered not the color I ordered Not happy at all !"
5,A Concise History of Chickamauga,"As with the other titles in Osprey's Campaign Series, 'Chickamauga 1863: The River of Death' presents the history of this famous battle of The War Between The States in a factual and easy-to-read text. Of particular note are the many photos and artists renderings as well as the orders of battle for both the Confederate and Union forces. One is introduced to such pivotal figures as Nathan Bedford Forrest, James Longstreet, Braxton Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, George Thomas, and William Rosecrans. The contributions of these men to the battle, as well as those of lesser-known officers and enlisted men, are recounted in a even-handed but quick-paced and enjoyable manner. After digesting this 96 page book one cannot help but have a better understanding of The Battle of Chickamauga as well as its causes and effects."
1,Poor quality,"The disk was stamped ""For promotion use only, not for sale"" and recording quality was horrible."
4,"Look good, cut well, original Honda mats are better","Look good, cut well, better fit than original mats. Great value for the price, original Honda mats are $100. This was $65However, original Honda mats are better quality. These were a little thin and stitching is not as good as original Honda. But for a 10-year old Civic, these are great!The '99 Civics (my car) come in 2 interiors: tan & charcoal. For the charcoal (my car), these Smoke mats are too dark. I should have gotten gray. It was dififcult to judge from the website colors. However for a 10-YO car, it's ok.Speedy shipping."
1,a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the original,"I needed to get a new one to replace the last one that I bought from neiman Marcus, I did my homework and found out that Fragancenet has some decent reviews, so I placed my order, I was excited to get a SM for a fraction of the original. UNFORTUNALLY i learned my lesson, what I received was a cheap fake-imitacion of the original. I sent it backof course. IF you have never try the original from NMarcus you do not have a point to compare. So I save my money and got the Original.!! you may had a better luck; if so, please post the site where you got your fragance. THX"
4,absolutely authentic,"Creed Silver Mountain Watersold and procured by Amazon is actually authentic. I have been using this particular Creed Scent for many years now and used to buy it at a flagship Creed retailer. I kept all the bottles of the years and compared not just the scent but also the authenticity of the bottles, packaging, inlays etc.Awesome Deal Amazon.I only took a star off my rating, because amazon does not tell you that it is classified as a hazardous material and prime shipping does not apply.Otherwise great buy, highly recommend it if you like this scent."
1,FAKE,Luckily I had a bottle of real Silver Mountain Water to know the difference. Was purchasing this as a gift for a friend (I think SMW is the best Creed scent :)They did a good job mimicking the top notes but you can tell this is fake because in 5 minutes you won't smell anything (fake devoid of middle/basenotes). My original bottle I can wash the garment and STILL smell remnants of the scent. Don't be fooled.These are easy to spot because of the arabic writing on the bottom of the box.Got a quick refund sad to see this is still being sold on Amazon. DO NOT BUY HERE.
2,I'm not sure this is the real thing?,The sampler smells slightly different than the stuff I buy at Sacks Fifth Ave. Not sure why. Might be a knock-off.
4,Great price- Rectified,"I did have a small mix up with my order, however, it was rectified and I'm completely satisfied with my order. Definitely couldn't have found this item for a better price anywhere!!!"
3,Unique scent. Maybe too much for most,"This is a unique scent. It might be too much for people to wear. It's metallic notes are quite strong, and could give some a headache or have nausea (it did for me).I would give this a try before buying the big bottle. It is a well done fragrance though. Only ""Silver"" by Al-Rehab is very similar to it for a fraction of the price"
3,I don't get it.,"Based on the reviews of this legendary cologne, I don't know what I was expecting - but I didn't really like it. It's too floral for me. It smells dated. And I can definitely understand why people say it's just an overpriced version of Cool Water. It reminds me of that too."
2,Is this male perfume or female ?,"its good but nothing special and this scent for females not for men no doubt, in addition its expensive not worth this price ."
1,More religious oriented than practical,"Too much ""turn your problems over to God,"" too little practical steps to take to deal with the grieving of divorce and get on with one's life. But...my mistake. I was looking for a workbook for a client to use to supplement therapy. This is obviously not that."
4,Great Resource....,"I wasn't a philosophy major in college, but this was one of the few books outside of my major that proved to be useful enough to make me want to keep once the course was over. it has depth and scope and the breakdown of the various philosophical styles and philosophers is beyond what you normally find in an intro class text."
2,Good as a companion to another method,"This is primarily a book on chord progressions. Starting with the most popular chords used in music, and then moving to other chords in open in barre position. Interspersed here and there are some tips on playing guitar. Not much more than that, and not very well organized.I would consider this most beneficial as a companion to lessons or to a complete method found elsewhere. There just isn't much to it. It's 80 pages, but each page generally contains two 4-chord progressions. I also found that several of the chords listed are inaccurate -- or at least inconsistent with several other sources I checked them against.I've used about 6 different books and software on learning the guitar, and I found this to be the least helpful. But there are some great reference diagrams that I still refer to, and as it is entirely focused on popular progressions, it finds a home being used in conjunction with another book."
5,A great way to learn how to play guitar....,This guitar book is very clear and to the point with bold and easy to understand illustrations. I also highly recommend The 'Next Stage' Guitar Book - Learn How To Play Scale Patterns & Tabs Easily & Quickly! Both these guitar books make a great package in learning how to play guitar.
3,Not worth the price,"My first thought on this book when I opened it was, ""did they send me a rip off copied version?"" For $13 the Spiral Bound book looks like someone photo copied and bound this book themselves and resold it. As for the information inside...it is fairly informative and definitely tells you everything you need to know as a beginner. But the book does not flow very well. Someone with zero knowledge about the guitar would have a hard time learning anything from this book. It's great for beginners with a little bit of knowledge already, or for those who would like a book for quick references."
5,I Love This Book!!,I have bought several guitar books and never used them because they were not helpful. This book is wonderful. I have been playing the guitar for five years and have never learned so much than I have from reading this book. Thank you Chris!
1,Skimpy wipes,"When I saw the size of the container I thought 'no way are there 65 wipes in there'. Well, there may be. Each wipe is about 2"" x 5"" and couldn't possibly be any thinner. I ordered this thinking Fellowes was a good brand and only saw one positive review at the time. I would have returned it, but there was a shipping fee to get the tiny container (4.6"" x 2.8"" x 1.3"") and would have been another to return it. I used it to wipe my computer screen & it smeared. I had to redo it, wiping it with a dry cloth afterwards to prevent this. I didn't realize that alcohol-free products just spread the dirt around. This is mostly my fault for not paying attention to dimensions, but the picture is deceiving; it makes the product appear much larger. Don't waste your money."
2,Mediocre,This is a very mediocre product. Left my various LCD screens streaked and dirty looking. Also left my hands stinky. Tried Bryson and it worked like a total charm. I would skip these wipes.
4,A solid Discworld book,"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Interesting Times is #17.]I quite enjoyed Interesting Times. It was nice to revisit and find out what happened with our friend Rincewind, and while there were aspects of the plot that I could see coming from far away, there were some clever twists and turns that kept things interesting. I wish there had been a little bit more dialogue from some of the parties, but overall it kept moving rather well and was a solid read."
5,Magical Reading,I have read all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books and loved each one of them. The characters at the Unseen University are all fun to read about and they show their true colors in this book. The spoof of our world's XXXX continent is hilarious!
2,the first TP to disappoint me,"They can't all be great, I guess. Interesting Times let me down. It's disjointed and repetitive, thus boring. Where other TPs contain several story threads each entertaining in its own right, Interesting Times seems to have a few storylines whose relationship is muddled. The vividness of the other novels (distinctive names, smell and texture of The River Ankh, etc.) is lacking in this one. Interesting Times is just a political hammer over the reader's head. Not enough creativity here.Interesting Times is not up to the standards of Wyrd Sisters, Lords and Ladies, Equal Rites, Feet of Clay, and others."
5,one of the best Discworld books ever.,"One of my favrite Discworld it has everything in it. I have read every Discworld book writen so far. It has everything,Rincewind,Cohen the Barbarian,The Luggage,Ridcully evan Twoflower. This book is so funny that my brother shout at me to be quite and that how can i laught out loud at a book.A MUST READ!!!!"
5,The Wizzard returns,"Well, he had to come back one way or another, and once again Pratchett wheels you into a story that will make you laugh out loudlyfor a few seconds, only to realise that you're in a packed train on your way to work... Highly recomended to all Chaos Theorists >=o"
4,Interesting Times keeps you wanting more,"Interesting Times by Terry Pratchett is worth reading. Like Jingo, Feet of Clay, and other Discworld novels, each of its characters deserves a biography of their own. Allthough all of Pratchett's books are very funny, this is the only one that made me laugh out loud. It is very crazy, which characterizes Discworld novels. Take for instance 6 old men, one in a wheelchair, but able to take on armies. These and other odd characters appear in this book. I only give it four stars because the plot could be better."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"This is the second book I've read featuring Rincewind (the other being ""The Last Hero""). Admittedly, I could be wrong, but I strongly suspect a formula here: Rincewind is always in the wrong place at the wrong time, does everything wrong yet comes out ahead (thanks to outside help) despite himself. Something like that would get old REAL FAST, but fortunately, not all Discworld books are based on that pattern. Plus, I'm early enough in my reading that I haven't surpassed my threshhold for ""Rincewind-Ex-Machina.""I called this book a ""guilty pleasure"" and stick by it. I suspect if a different author had written something like this (without the rich flavor of Discworld to spice it up) I would have been a bit harsher in my review. However, it's Pratchett, who is always a pleasure to read: insightful AND funny. If you like the series as a whole, you'll most likely enjoy ""Interesting Times."""
4,Pratchett's guide on surviving China,"If you are going to spent some time in China, read this !! It is hilarious, witty, passionate and one of the best guides to Chinese mentality available. After this, even the standard behaviour of Chinese cab drivers and street vendors cannot surprise you any more. May you live in interesting times ..."
4,Nice one,"Discworld anti-hero Rincewind and one of its heroes - the Luggage :) - are back. With the support of Cohen and his horde of elderly co-barbarians, they stir trouble in the Discworld equivalent of China, where politeness keeps the People's Army from getting on with their revolution. Well-written, funny, nice to read!"
5,Make Considerable Sacrifice For The Common Good,"This is probably the most readable book in the Discworld series. It fouses on Rincewind the failed wizard's attempts to escape from Hunghung, capital of the Agatean Empire. Fans of the series should be delighted, as the book contains Dibbler (Dhblah?), the wizards of the UU and Death in minor but significant roles. On his way, Rincewind meets Cohen the Barbarian's Silver Horde, the cream (or cheese) of barbarian fighters, who have been avoiding death all their lives (it's all they've ever done). Aargh!, potatoes and the mythical room 3B occur throughout, as well as the extremely polite Hunghung ""rebels"" who think that putting up posters constitutes a revolution. Funny, witty, infinetly detailed and endlessly re-readable, Interesting Times is a classic."
4,Not-quite-the-same-old Rincewind novel,"Rincewind, the worlds worst Wizard and greatest runner-away, returns to get embroiled in the politics of the Counterweight continent. It's a reunion of sort, with a lot of the old Discworld gang.Usually, Rincewind stories are not that insightful or deep, and sadly less interesting that those of the Lancre Witches, the Night Watch, etc. Fortunately, Pratchett combines his thoughtful insights with the usual story of how-many-times-can-Rincewind-escape. One gets a look at cultures that become too withdrawn and too traditional, and contrasts them with the barbarian honor of Cohen the barbarian and his ""horde"" of aged barbarians. There are also several charming insights into just how revolutionary things we take for granted are.Not the best Discworld novel, but definately a cut above some of the other Rincewind tales."
2,Tasty but Damaged,"Devonsheer Onion Melba Rounds are hard to find in my area so a case from Amazon looked like a great deal. The problem is that (easily) half of the crackers were broken into many pieces in the three boxes (out of 12) I've opened.Without some improvement in the remaining boxes, I probably won't purchase them again."
2,where's the onion?????,product needs more of a taste of onion.if in fact it had any onion favor added to product in the first place.
2,Works But Substandard Materials Used,"I was able to accomplish what I needed to with this auger, but I destroyed it in the process. First, I had to modify the shaft on a grinder, so that it wouldn't slip in my drill. Toward the end of the first day of use, the shaft bent (can't straighten it without breaking it), so that it is no longer useable. Instead of good steel, the Chinese maker used pot metal. I tried to buy American, but couldn't find a small auger on the market. Don't we make anything any more?"
1,Poor Quality Tool,"I purchased the JR-18 through Amazon.com on June 5th 2012. The first time I tried to use it in our flower garden it broke off at the point where the shaft meets the spindles (dirt is firm but not hard, a shovel easily digs in it, and it had been raining so the auger went in and out very easily on the first 2 holes and then on the third hole it went right in and then when reversing it out it just snapped off.). I would like to get a warranty replacement, but non one will respond to my emails about it. I have tried to contact the seller with no response. According to Amazon it is passed the window to be replaced or returned. As all I want to say is when dealing over the internet ""Buyer Beware"" because after the sale you may never hear from them again."
4,"Well written, carefully researched story format","This is a good book, well written and very readable. It has more evidence than any other I've seen regarding the allegations of sexual abuse and multiple wives. Evidence of the allegations, that is. Not necessarily evidence that they are true. The warrants are included in detail, which is helpful. Koresh's public radio sermon is included, unfortunately edited ""for clarity."" This book clearly paints the opposing point of view to Carol Moore's ""The Davidian Massacre"". I highly suggest reading them both."
1,Pat Travers - Self Titled,"If you'relooking for an album quality recording transferred to CD, then be my guest. If quality is important to you, then I highly recommend that you avoid this release as well as any other Pat Travers release from Majestic Records in UK. They all contain very poor sound quality and noise. A lifelong P.T. fan, but heavily disappointed with the sound quality of these releases. I contacted Majestic Records and they will not issue refund."
4,Flashback!,"The first three Pat Travers albums were all about tone and timing. I've never found his subsequent offerings to be as compelling -- too bad he didn't stick with the MXR Phase 90, wah-wah, Marshall set-up that this recording showcases, as well as the whack rhythm changes . Check out the grinding tone of the main guitar track on ""Makes No Difference"", especially at the end of the tune. The other showcase track is ""Feelin' Right,"" especially the funky bridge in the middle. His songwriting was a great foil for Mars Cowlings phenomenal, archetype P-Bass style. The cover songs were a distraction for me, as they seemed to confine Pat's real style. And that's the only reason I rate this one with 4/5 stars.The CD version of ""Pat Travers"" could have been US$50 and I still would have bought it. If you think PT was all about live concerts and ""Boom Boom,"" you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's raw and rockin'."
3,Face to Face finally getting back to form.,"This is the best face to face album since the Why Aren't You Happy EP. I wouldn't say this is as good as thier first three albums, but it is not a bad effort. There are some great songs on this record. I would highly recommend this album compared to most of the albums that have been coming out on Vagrant. This is not a five star album though."
5,My favorite album period,"I've had this album for awhile (since early 2002) but I just thought to write a review of it to tell people how good it is. I've only recently become a Face to Face fan so I only like their newer stuff (Ignorance is Bliss and up). I got this CD after hearing they were good, looking them up and hearing a few song clips. I wasn't terribly interested in them but I thought they were pretty good. When I first listened to it, I liked a few of the songs but wasn't crazy about it. But the songs kept growing on me and I started liking them more and more.The thing I really like about this album is I kept listening to songs which I once disliked and I thought, ""What the crap, this song is awesome!!"". It's like gradually getting a new awesome CD, always finding out that I like these songs.I really suggest this album. It's got a raw feel but it's not unbearable and the singer has an awesome voice! I like melodic punk rock and that's one of the reasons I love F2F."
4,Great for kids but...,"Clue-finders are great games for learning, however if you decide to buy other clue-finders games, this one includes a second cd, Mystery of the Missing Amulet, which is the same as the Clue-finders Reading adventures for 9-12, I wasted some money not knowing, now I own 2, would have been nice if they had the name in the title."
1,Program locks up,"I purchased this software last month but I am unable to rate it because it locked up during the ""Pattern"" skill. Maybe it is just my version, but my grandchildren were disappointed."
4,A one stop ISO 9000 education!,Before reading this book I literally knew nothing about ISO 9000.

5,Learn from the woman who taught me...,"More than a few years ago, I had the extremely good fortune to be mentored in the art of animation writing by Christy Marx, who told it like it was about the biz and taught me all about the basics in great detail. Now a professional myself with credits as an animation production coordinator and writer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book. Not only does it cover all the ground she taught me about animation writing with the same depth and care, it takes on comics and videogames, two mediums which have become more and more intertwined with animation over the last two decades -- something which is taken into account throughout the book. Whether you're trying to figure out if any or all of this areas are for you, or just looking for a better understanding of the business, this is an excellent primer."
3,poor recording,"the music is good. i saw them live and loved them enough that i bought this album. but i got it and was really disappointed in the quality of audio. i played this cd on many stereo systems and concluded that their music had become a victim to sloppy recording. which really frustrates me because i would love to listen to it, but it is hard for me to tolerate the muddy base lines and the fuzzy cymbals. if you are going to be listening to this cd on small computer or laptop speakers, i'm sure you wont be able to tell. but if you want to listen to it on a system aimed for high fidelity like i do, i'm sure you will be as disappointed as i am."
4,Greek Grammar,I bought this book to assist me with my Greek grammar and supplement my formal instruction. I love it. There are verbs in here I did not know existed! The print is clear and the style easy to read. It's a great resource book. I did not see it available in hard cover or spiral. I find those kinds of bindings last longer.
3,Iverson's Autumn,"This is an interesting story of a young woman's introduction to a totally disfunctional family.Sadly, the editing leaves a lot to be desired and appears to have had no professional editing done before being sent to the vanity press.As the daughter of the author, I can say Mama wrote a remarkable story and even with the oddities of editing, it is worth looking into for a good read."
4,Used as a High School graduation gift for a prospective college student,"Nice, user-friendly, intro to basic Philosophy. Engaging and makes philosophy relevant to everyday life."
5,Inspiring,"De Botton is a terrifc, fun writer, to my mind. Serious topics, intelligent and illuminating, but still the sense that here is a writer and thinker unafraid to speak simply."
1,I agree...,"...with the former review. I saw the book displayed in a bookstore and checked it out at the university library where I work. The illustrations act as fillers and quite frankly the book is aimed at a very basic overview of philosophical thought. Each chapter reads like the pretentious term-paper of a bright university/high school student. This would be adequate for the ""Young Adult"" or ""Juvenile"" section of the book store. If you are a habitual reader you might be disappointed"
2,Dull,"I found this book very dull to read. This book is filled with stories about different philosophers under a number of general topics. Consolations for unpopularity, not having enough money, frustration, inadequacy, a broken heart, and difficulties are all explored.The problem that I found with this book is that De Botton approaches each of these topics in an extremely cursory manner. I got the impression that De Botton was simply telling stories and felt disappointed that a more critical approach wasn't taken to each of these topics.If you're looking for a surface level exploration of some popular topics and want to be entertained by some stories about philosophers this may be a good book for you-- the book is full of illustrations and does contain some entertaining stories. However, if you're looking for a more critical text, that considers multiple viewpoints, and doesn't have the fluff of a popular book I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
5,Living philosophically,"If you are a person who has found the only way to live and thrive in this world is to seek more than materiality, this book is a great overview of six well-known philosophers. Alain de Botton is a good writer and his presentation demonstrates an unconventional approach to presenting these philosophers with a depth and clarity that is born of study and enjoyment of the material.The Consolations of Philosophy"
3,Cliff Notes for Philosophy,"As with all things, this book has both positive and negative points. Alain De Botton writes in such a manner, that philosophy becomes available to the masses. (And without having to read the origional Greek, French, Latin, or German) However, he chooses to gloss over his explanations of his interpretations. This book is successful in exposing six renown philosophers to the casual student. However, for the serious student, it does little more than wet the appetite.So, the question with the value of this book becomes what do you want to accomplish? If you are looking for a good book to read while sipping a Latte at your local Starbucks, and you want a conversation starter with that cute girl three tables over, then this is for you. If you actually need your philosophy expounded upon, then you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,"Good Content, Weak Style (for a popular book)","Despite title's reservations, I enjoyed Chapter 4 which is essentially what Montaigne advised on how to understand and use knowledge. Scabs and Arses, Scabs and Arses! =-)"
1,Pretentious,"Anyone with a passing knowledge of philosophy will find de Botton's pick'n'mix style superficial in the extreme. Wild exagerations, lazy generalizations, and improbable connections are offered up like solemn pronouncements from on high. The New York Times wrote a damming review of this book, and I can see why. De Botton thinks he is cleverer than his audience and lets us know on every page."
5,Nice contribution,"As one who has waded through quite a few overviews of philosophy, De Botton's book was a breath of fresh air. By focusing on specific themes from four philosophers, he gave me several concrete concepts that have influenced how I live in the world.Although I'm certain that some professional philosophers might discount the book, I highly recommend it as an efficient means to see how philosophy can inform and enrich your life. I hope that he writes more."
5,Thought Provoking Distillation Of Six Philosophical Giants,"This remarkable little book takes the work of Socrates, Seneca, Epicurus, Montaigne, Shopenhauer and Nietzsch and distills each into a response to universal and timeless challenges. It is cleverly conceived, well executed and as entertaining as a book about these thinkers could be. For Philosophical purists it might seem light weight and pedestrian. For a general readership seeking to be introduced to essential elements of the thoughts and lives of these men it succeeds wonderfully. I think Alain de Botton has hit the mark with this one. Highly recommended."
2,Condition,The book arrived and I did order used but the overall condition was poor . The cover and some pages were folded along with bad writing and highlighting in every 1 of 20 pages . I should have got lower price but I needed the book for school . At least no missing pages or late on shipment .
2,thumbs down,"The author seems to have a good grasp on the subject matter. I did not care for the writing style. Many people love this book, probably because it takes a higher level view of philosophy."
2,Not one my Top 10,"This is definetely not one of ""Chente's"" best productions, as a matter of fact I found it rather repetitious and trite. The previous reviewer hit it right on the mark, this CD stated picking momentum ONLY after I had about my 15th Budweiser. I have bought the CD, and will keep it, but it's not one of my favorites."
3,A fine work nonetheless!,"Overall, this is a fine album because Vicente Fernandez has the uncanny ability to make even mediocre songs sound good. That is not to say that this album lacks gems. I especially like the mariachi sound on ""Maria,"" ""Que Bonita, Que Bonita,"" and ""Yo Quiero Ser Tu Marido."" Those three songs are worth their salt."
2,It's Ok,"I think it is a very nice album and all but you have to say that it is too old unless you are wreckless drunk because from what I know only drunk people listen to it,but like I said I like it it's just that some people listen to it a little too much and it gets on my nerves well that's all I have to say about that CD."
5,The Comeplete Guide of Western Horsemanship,"This book is awesome for people wanting to learn about care and development of your horse. It also talks about how to ride western with the correct form and how to teach your horse to follow your commands, because after all, you are the boss. This book also talks about how to care for your tack and store it in the correct ways. I would suggest this book for anyone interested in the best for thier horse."
4,Anorexia,"I wasn't sure if this book would be helpful, but it is by far one of the best books on eating disorders that I have found. There is a checklist to see if you are in danger of becoming anorexic, and also steps to recover that are very useful and encouraging."
5,Encouraging and Full of Insight,"This book is not only a wonderful resource for sufferers of anorexia. But it is also a resource for thier family and friends. The book explains anorexia, tells Monika Ostroff's personal story, and has a special chapter for family and loved ones. Everyone who suffers from anorexia or has a spouse, family member, or friend with anorexia, should read this book."
5,Nice quality tap,"Assuming the price is still on par with hardware stores, then the main reason to buy this tap is if you can get it with free shipping (prime or otherwise). It's one of those tools that's good to have around, in general, and fine thread is good. Note that this is a bottom tap, not a taper tap."
2,Pretentious Horse Manure,"I found the author to be obsessed with his own visions of the album, taking page after page to outline his personal theories, leaving little of this thin book to describe the actual album. The best quotes in the book were lifted from the excellent Waiting On the Sun book on the LA music scene of the '60s. While the author's takes on the lyrics and Arthur's mindset when writing the album have some validity, it comes off more as a late night dormitory bull session between people trying to show off their intellect. So if you want to connect Marat/Sade and Gnosticism to Forever Changes, have a read."
4,Better understanding,"The author of the book has gone through a similar run of events like I did when listening to 'Forever Changes'. You don't really know if you like it, but you keep listening to it and it gets better with every spin.This book has given me an even deeper inside in the music and most of all the lyrics and is a great accompaniment to the CD."
1,"I always enjoyed Arthur Lee and ""Love"" but...","This volume reads like something someone wrote as a literary disertation for some type of graduate work in music studies. It wasn't anything I could become interested in, because the bulk of the writer's narrative takes an exciting, groundbreaking recording and evaluates the music and lyrics in antisceptic, academic terms. What research in the way of first-hand interviews with band members or other methods of information-gathering for this project was unclear to me. Although the writer was able to string his thoughts into a coherent analysis, I was very disappointed with the overall content. It did not tell me anything about the album ""Forever Changes"" that I didn't already know or couldn't have imagined."
2,Love's Forever Changes (33 1/3 series),"I was excited to get this book, to learn a bit about the album and it's making. What I got was someone's (at least it reads like) doctoral thesis. This is an intellectual analysis, guesswork in many instances, some fact thrown in. When someone tries so hard to have a heady read, over the head of many indeed, it is usually, in my experience, a lot of maybe this did happen..and maybe some of it didn't, but it is just very boring and it is taking far to long to read this little book that offers little about the group, and guesses much about the mental state of Arthur Lee."
1,LoVE's Forever Changes - 33 1/3 book,"Length:: 1:55 MinsNot a very good bookCouldn't he just write about the album, talk about the sessions, how the group was replaced on the Wrecking Crew on the first couple of songs?Its a mess. I can't recommend. The other books in this series I've read on the Kinks and the early Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett were so much better booksIf you're a Love fan just read the Castle. For God's sake don't waste time on this rot!"
2,"good music, interesting lyrics, strange book","""The gnomic interiority of its lyrics invites the type of deep exegesis usually reserved for..."" is not a really atypical sentence opening in Hultkrans' book. If you like ""Love"" and this sort of writing, you will really like this book. Otherwise, you may be better off reading the book on the group by Love's 3rd drummer, Michael Stuart-Ware."
5,Best quality,"Twinlabs makes the best quality amino acids I have found to date. L-Phenylalanine is converted by the brain into dopamine and norepinephrine, and by the adrenal glands into adrenaline. If you have a need for increased mental acuity or depression relief, this may be helpful. If you suffer from anxiety, this supplement is very likely to MAKE THINGS WORSE (see review below). People with cardiac arrhythmias may also want to avoid this. If you are on an antidepressant, especially an MAOI, avoid this until you've discussed it with your doctor."
1,Didn't work for anxiety,I have heard this vitamin could be helpful for anixety so I thought I would give it a try. It made my anxiety worse. I don't know if this is good for any other conditions but anxiety isn't one of them.
4,Where's The....Rest of the Story?,"I really loved this series and the charactes; the writing is very good and I wanted more. But, alas, there is no more. The fifth book is all there is and no end to the underlying mystery.So, Mr. Grant...where the heck are the rest of the Black Oak books? You owe it to your readers to finish the series!Or, at the very least, someone can make this a mini-series on the sci-fi channel (Peter Weller as Ethan Proctor) and give this story the ending it deserves. I have been waiting long enough!"
2,Ethan Proctor is no Dupin!,"You know, for a whiz detective Ethan Proctor does NOTHING!Every Black Oak installment is identical--Proctor sits around while his cronies sleuth to uncover some dimwitted half-truth.There's no Bernie Rhodanbarr-esque intrigue, no Tim Underhill ratiocination, no deadpan brilliance. In fact, there is NOTHING about Proctor that's admirable. Book after book, he sits around as murky events unfold (note to author--do you purposely muddle your stories to make them sound cool?). Then, when there's no one left to kill, Proctor lights out for the anatagonist--whom is unguessable owing to Grant's lousy style--and deftly deals out death.Forget this noise! I used to think John Saul told the same story over and over, but Grant is just as deserving of the ""DRIVEL"" award."
3,TERROR OUT OF THE SKY,Its a fair sequal as sequals go to the savage bees I would have rated this movie one or two more stars if the savage bees was included in a two disc set to help viewers know whats it all about and fill in the blanks.
3,"Nice looking truck, but...","We have this truck and while my 18 month-old son loves to push it around, the wheels don't turn, at least when pushed on non-carpeted floors. We'll wait until spring and try it again outside when he can push it on concrete and see if the wheels get moving. He loves to push the button that makes the noise, though to me it sounds as much like a toilet flushing as it does a sound a truck makes."
1,What a Rip Off!!,"Anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the Autograph card and NO MEMORABILIA CARD. You cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens. You look and look, searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow, but no. No Memorabilia Card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles. Of course, the Topps Company doesn't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby! Thanks."
5,Why I require each client to read this book,"I've been a massage therapist and healer for 13 years. I now require each potential client to read this book and Music and Song, Mother and Love, both by John Diamond. I often recommend other books along the way, but these two books set the tone for all of the work we do together. Together with Facets of a Diamond: Reflections of a Healer, these books should be required reading for all healers and those who really want to support their own healing."
5,Brandenburg Gate,This item was received on time in great condition. Thank you for your prompt service.
4,Good value.,I got the mini-stepper to replace the walking I do during golf season. I've only used it for about a month and so far it's working out well. In 30 minutes my legs get a good workout and my pulse goes over 90 which I was looking for. The machine is solid and the design seems like it will last. The flexbands don't do much except help with your balance.
4,Kim Possible : Global Gemini,"My Kids really enjoyed this game, while it lasted. We had it for approximately 2 weeks, playing it I would say moderately, and the all of a sudden the sound stopped. All of our other games still work fine, except this one. I don't know if it was defective, it worked fine in the beginning, and like I said, my kids really liked it. Just a FYI."
1,Give me more people!!!,"Like all of the other customer reviews, Nadine's Husband was a awesome story in the book. Out of all the other stories, that was the only decent story, GIVE ME MORE PEOPLE. I was highly disappointed with the other stories I read, I didn' even finish the book. This is really bad, coming from a person who has to finish any and ever book that I start."
4,Interesting read,I enjoyed this book although I didn't particularly care for gay/lesbian story included this book was good. I'd reccommend it to people who like to read romance novels or just relationship novels period.
4,"Preston Allen should expand ""Nadine's Husband"" into a book!","Like all good stories the ending should leave you wanting more. Reading ""Nadine's Husband"" left me wanting to know everything. I just have to know what happened next. Does she just go on loving him? How does she continue being ""little sister"" after she's finally gotten her heart's desire only to have it taken away by the love of her life?Preston L. Allen is no joke and should shop this short story around as a chapter to his upcoming book. The remainder of the stories in Brown Sugar are okay but ""Nadine's Husband"" won over my passion and took my heart. I know all writers are different but I would have loved to see more stories with the power of Preston Allen's words. Most of the stories just seemed like words on paper, flat and without depth. Mr. Allen may have spoiled it for all that followed.Being able to read ""Nadine's Husband"" was worth buying the book!"
1,Complete and utter crap.,"Do NOT buy this book! It was terrible. Some of the most horribly written and boring stories I've ever read. The ""sex"" in this book, if you could even call it that, was minimal and poorly executed. You will bored, flaccid, and beyond disappointed that you spent your hard earned money on this atrocity. Again, do NOT purchase this book."
1,Crappy...,I though that the book would have way more sex than it turned out to have.. All the stories were so freakin boring I couldn't really get into them.. I thought that the book was going to have a whole bunch of sexual stories but instead they were more like bed time stories..I would definently tell anyone thinking of buying this book to save ur money and purchase somthing else because thi book is not what you would expect it to be...
4,Well Done,Well written erotica featuring people of color is sometimes hard to find. I was thoroughly impressed with the writting and the content of each short story. This is worth savoring with a loved one or in a relaxed moment with a glass of wine. One of my favorites Deecy and Pheo by Kwame Dawes. Check it out.
2,texas woman,this is the biggest mess i have ever read. this book supose to be erotic but i found it boring. i have read books with just a little sex in it and it have been better than this. there's maybe one or two maybe three stories in this book that are good but the rest of it is a mess
1,BAD,"This book was awful, I would give it 1/2 Star. It is no comparison to Zane's Sex chronicles. Some of the stories were very hard to understand. Some of the stories like Nadine's Husband and Why I became a writer, Were pretty good. I can't say that I would reccomend this book to anyone."
1,Where is the sex?,"I am so sorry, but I can't say that there was anything erotic at all about this book. I was looking for erotica not soft porn. It was like having someone think that they were going to a full-course meal and they were served Ritz crackers.Alpine County, in my opinion was very boring. If I wanted to know about two lesbian that lived until they were 70-something years old I would of watched ""If These Walls Could Talk"" on HBO. Stupid story, very stupid story.Movie Lover, all it did was talk about what the title suggest, the love of movies. No sex really to speak of though.White Girl Blues, a black man that loves having sex with a white female that has a black virgin as a girlfriend. This story to me goes a little deeper than sex. I feel as though this story was trying to pull a race card. Whatever though, the story was still garbage.Overall, the book was no good. Give me some hot steamy sex that will make pages melt."
3,A good reminder when tensions flare,"This book does a good job of addressing common marital (or co-habitation) problems in an objective way. It's a good reminder of how to fight fair and to think of things from your partner's perspective, something that often gets lost in the heat of battle. It doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know (or should know), but if you can remember some of the points and try to implement them regularly so that they become second-nature, it can make those annoying habits of others -- and yourself! -- more bearable. If you've tried to convince your partner that manners are important even (or especially) when it's just the two of you, reading excerpts of this book to him or her may help. It's very balanced, as far as the male vs. female perspective goes, and doesn't approach conflict as if one sex is always right. That objectivity improves its credibility."
2,Good Information but Nothing Mind Blowing,"I'm a therapist and most of my work is in the realm of mental health. That being said I also do a lot, privately and in the mental health field, in negotiating relationships and their pitfalls.This book, while full of good information, is rather... lets say safe, if not common sense or anecdotal in it's approach to negotiating some of a relationship's most common problem areas. While it has good information, most of it isn't very in depth or comprehensive. It sort of glosses over the topics and gives some very basic advice but definitely nothing revolutionary or mind blowing.All-in-all I would probably not recommend this book to anyone unless your are a new couple with a lot of ignorance regarding ""the basics"" of making a relationship function and/or needing information on how to be respectful to your mate."
3,Basic introductory material only.,"This is not in any way a business plan, but rather an introduction to the common sense approach anyone will require when entering the PI field. I don't think there are any 'biggies' in this book that will take anyones breath away. In that sense another title would have been appropriate. It's just (introductory) practical advice from someone who has been in the industry for many years and has a reasonable ability at writing books. Paladin Press, the publishers, tout this title as their 'Best Seller' in the PI section of their own catalogue. That's really hard to believe, but maybe it's true. Pehaps Paladin just get more PI text orders from newbies than they do from the seasoned readers who are looking for the more in depth material. Anyway, happy reading everyone, whatever you buy."
1,Ouch!,"No joke. This book is a stinker. Mr Pankau should be ashamed of himself for literally peddling low level cheap intro material, as if in some way it's supoosed to introduce people to the real nuts and bolts of what it takes to not only become a PI but to actually start up an agency.As far as I'm concerned the life and work of a PI is serious business, and people starting out just shouldn't have to be distracted by writers like Pankau who do no more than suppliment their annual income with the writing of cheap books. This practice also cheapens the industry as a whole."
4,"How to Make $100,000 a Year As a Private Investigator","... As an experienced private investigator with many years in the field and having survived the years of ""growing"" to become successful, I have to say that Mr. Pankau's book, together with his seminars, have been a great help. In our small PI community Mr. Pankau is an icon. He is in the top 5% of all private investigators in the world. This book was not written for someone who has been in the field for years and years but for the many new starters who hopefully can learn from the introductory texts Mr. Pankau has published. For the amateurs who love to watch Dan Tanner reruns and after reading a book on private investigation want to make it big in the profession, it is not a book to read. Gazza and some of the others may need to give it a little time to grow as investigators to understand the broad guidance that is actually represented in the book."
1,Not clear. Garbage!,Label is nowhere near clear. I was hoping to use it on clear plastic product containers. Closer to white than clear. It looked about like wax paper you have in your kitchen.
2,False Label,"This was not ' Clear' but a matt type sheet, consequently I searched and found a 'CLEAR ' product at Pat Catan's craft store.Grapfix band 'Clear' Adhesive Backed for Ink Jet printer. This fits the bill for my needs."
5,High-quality labels,"I used these to create labels for our wedding favors (cookie bags) and the quality was perfect. They were easy to load and print and the colors I used printed nicely on the paper. I used a paper trimmer to cut so I could get straight lines, but this would easily cut with scissors"
1,Not Clear,"The add claims ""Clear full-sheet labels"", but they are actually frosty matte finish. ""Clear"" should be transparent with either gloss or matte finish."
2,Clear Full Sheet Labels,This was not what I expected. I thought clear meant see through. I had no problem returning the item which was a plus.
1,AWFUL,If I could give LESS than one star I would. They are NOT CLEAR! At best they are opaque. HUGE waste of money!
2,A perfectly ok rainy Sunday record nearly ruined,"Some decent tracks here, but the robot voice that introduces each song as the next ""challenge"" is corny, annoying, incredibly distracting, and managers to ruin any sense of the album as a whole."
5,THE WACO EXPRESS IS BACK IN TOWN!,"Ex-Mekon Jon Langford and his band of Waco Brothers are back in the saddle with the new barn burner 'Waco World'.Hang on to your boots and lock up your daughters when these guys come to town with this new batch of songs. This stuff is tequilla powered insurgent country with a biting lyrical edge.Songs like 'Pigsville', 'Day Of The Dead' and 'Corrupted' are more Langford classics, and Deano throws in a house shaker with 'Red Brick Wall'.See these guys on tour, and get it while it's hot!"
3,Not their best,"While I consider myself a big fan of the Waco Brothers, this latest offering from Chicago's country punk icons lacks the energy of their previous efforts. If you're looking for the best Jon Langford and his brethren have to offer look to ""To The Last Dead Cowboy"" or ""Cowboy In Flames."" Those discs have a key ingredient that ""Waco World lacks,"" fun. This disc of mostly mid-tempo songs will be a disappointment to those turned on to the bands high-octane style exhibited in their previous efforts. I don't want to give the impression that this is not a good disc; on its own it is a solid set of songs. However, in comparison to their previous three recordings, it falls somewhat flat."
1,D-Link DPH-541,"Great phone when you get it to work, manual terrible. very hard to understand and worst of all if the battery dies there is no way of getting a spare. If you contac a dealer he will sell you the phone but for batteries you will be referred to D-Link. On the other hand, no one in D-Link has a clue on where you can get a battery.Sad situation for a relatively expensive good product"
4,D-Link WiFi phone,"Using with Asterisk PDX system, with remote locations on for continents.Using in Belgium with server in the US. Sound quality is very good! Very easy to use once set up with nice set of features. Battery life is a little short. If left plugged in when not is use, no problems. Setting up wifi connection is a pain if you do not know what security the wifi router is using."
4,"AquaTouch River Rocks Bath Mat, Blue","it supposed to stick on the bath tub floor and prevent slippering, but it happens that the mat shifts itself and doesn't stick on the tub floor that well."
1,"Instead of standing steady, I slipped x4","I thought these were going to give me a grip, but I fell down four times.When wet, it just would stick to my bath tub. Promptly returned (well after 4 days of falling down.)"
1,Not Good At All,Product is way to small for a standard size tub. Not good for standard size tubs or larger. This may be ok for those smaller square showers that have doors but not for regular tubs with curtains...this mat is not long enough.
3,Decent,"This isnt the worst Playoff Video I have seen. However, its not thebest either. . . this in no way as good as Playoff 1999, with SamanthaMichaels. Simply put, the two best videos ever made from Penthouse isPlayoff 99' , and Pet of the Year and Friends with Paige Summers. Yummy, those will rock your world."
1,Poor craftmanship,Photo cover detached from album and not able to reattach. Plastic screws less than 1/2 inch in length don't connect to anything. Don't waste your money on this product.
5,Perfect Album for the Perfect Wedding,"This album is beautiful, tasteful and elegant, the perfect size to hold all our photos from a small and simple, yet intimate and elegant wedding weekend. Easy to insert photos, and looks very nice on display. More than happy with this item."
4,"Beautiful, but now the price has almost doubled..??...","I would give this 5 stars as far as the quality of the frame, it made a great wedding gift. So much so that I need another gift for another wedding, came back to buy another one, and price is way more than it was! I paid $14.99 with free shipping back in May...so, if you can find the album for that price, I say buy it! Actually, buy 2 or 3, as you never know when you can't find them or the price has almost doubled!"
4,love the album; pages need to be replaced,"I love the album itself, and we've received a lot of compliments on it (it's on display in a prominent area in our home). Unfortunately, the pages inside the album aren't high quality, and they'll need to be replaced. Most of the pages are fine, but some have what appear to be smudges or scratches that can't be fixed. It's easy enough to find replacement pages, but I wish I didn't have to do so."
2,Can irritate your baby's skin,"I am not so sure but seems to me that if my daughter bites these blocks, she starts to have tiny little red dots on her face (around her mouth and her cheeks). I now don't give her these blocks to play anymore. I guess I will wait until she grows a bit more then throw out for her to play again. Hope she is not allergic to these blocks. FYI, my daughter skin is not sensitive at all. She has never any skin problem (rash...) with wipes, soap, detergent, diaper...Other toys I purchased did not cause any problem (she bites all of them though). She was 4 months old when I gave her these blocks. She was at the stage that she liked biting everything she had in her hands. I guess I will try these blocks again when she is around 7 months old and see. But be aware that your child can be allergic to these blocks like my little princess."
1,Terrible smell,"I can stand the smell of this vinyl blocks, and why they make a hole in them? Baby's saliva will accumulate there and cause bacteria and mold development"
3,Fun but not durable,"These are very fun squeaky blocks. My 1 yo and 3yo play with these a lot, but they are starting to crack. We purchased these for Christmas and by march they will have to be thrown out. We got them for a great deal so I can't complain too much but I did expect them to last longer."
5,"Nice, durable blocks at a great price",I purchased 2 sets of the blocks; one for my niece(18 months) and one for my daughter (2 years). They both loved them an immediately started playing with them. It is great for building motor skills and the material these are made of is safe for kids of all ages. Sometimes simple toys are just as much fun!
5,Great for all ages,I got this for my son when he was only 6mo and he loved to chew on them. I would build them up for him and he would knock them down. He loved it! He's now 13mo and he can already stack blocks. Great purchase!
1,Can smell the PVC-Inappropriate toy for teethers,"We were excited to find blocks that were rated 6m+ instead of a few years since my 7 month old puts everything in his mouth. As soon as we took it out of the package, you could smell the PVC and even after multiple attempts of washing, it was still strong. For this reason, I think it is dangerous to give to a child that puts everything in its mouth but might be appropriate for older kids who would use it for other learning activities."
3,"Nice blocks, but don't hold a candle to the Chubby Soft Blocks.","These are basic blocks, but they are all the same shape and I worry about baby chewing on these since they are not cloth and made in China, which has been in the news a lot with scary manufacturing issues. Having said that, babies can grasp them and older sibs can learn colors, objects, etc. They are some sort of soft plastic, I think-not wood or cloth."
5,This is the exact Battery that is supplied with the camera.,"At the price I paid for this, it was not long before I WENT BACK and ordered more. This is the exact battery that comes with the camera, not a knock off or cheap model."
5,Duh!,"Just got this battery a few days ago, it is an OEM replacement as pictured and not a knock-off. My original battery is no longer holding a charge very long and takes forever to charge back up. This thing hasn't needed to be re-charged yet. No idea on overall battery life yet but who cares at this price? I will be ordering more soon."
4,Please bring this book back to print,"I am a counselor and have been recommending this book to other parents, but I see now it is no longer in print. Please bring this book back! It is the easiest source I know of for dealing with a wide range of behaviors in a concrete manner.Mary Roper, M.S.W."
2,Reading Rainbow DVD's,"The Reading Rainbow features are dated, but great. The bonus features that it advertises are not there! Instead are some other, less useful clips. I was disappointed in the lack of accuracy on the packaging. As a teacher, I was really counting on one of the bonus feature programs."
1,Misleading Advertising,"As in all other reviews you have read, you need an additional battery pack for this to work. When I ordered this on-line from ToysR'Us it just says two AA batteries required. (Go back to the item and look) No where does it say you are required to purchse a battery pack to go with it. I am disappointed in ToysR'Us for their lack of information. I feel like I have been taken by Toys'R'Us and Tyco. I will probably send this item back, as it was meant to be a Christmas gift, and now that Christmas has come and gone without my son being able to play with it, he has lost interest in it completely."
2,Cool bike but no reverse,"The kids love the bikes, but as a parent who is chasing it at times to retrieve it. It needs a reverse mode--Also batteries don't last as long as kids would like. A good (BIG)parking lot is the best place for bike races--no grass allowed! Awful in the grass!"
1,I agree with above review!,"I also purchased this item online from toys r'us and saw no disclaimer that it required a $30 battery pack to work! This sort of information should be red flagged on the description!! This was for my son for Christmas and I am online now looking to find the specific battery to make it work. My son was disappointed he had to wait to try it, but we'll give it a go - it just better be worth all the effort!"
1,Incredibly stupid,"I thought the book was awful. Completely unbelievable. Can't umderstamd the glowing reviews, especially when there are so many very good books out there."
3,"Good News, A Quick Light Easy Read, Bad News, Better Interesting Secret Agent Novels Out There","The British Secret Service isn't what it used to be and two agents named Charlie and George have there own reasons for contemplating retirement. Unbeknownst to both of them an error from their superiors has simultaneously placed them both undercover at the same two man photograph processing booth at Oxford Circus tube station. They are even more surprised when they both receive the photograph of their next hit, each other. Together they must work out how to escape The Secret Service who have targeted them for elimination while individually working out if they can trust the other, or if the other is just playing along to carry out their hit.Good News Bad News is not a bad novel and will certainly pass the time amicably but for a secret agent thriller or conspiracy type novel there are much better and fast paced alternatives out there."
2,"Good Start, Bad Finish","The great opening and early chapters had me hooked. But then, things slowed down considerably, and it just seemed to ramble on & on, not going anywhere. I finally gave up about 50 pages from the end, because by then nothing was going to save it for me."
1,Run Away While You Can,"This is by far one of the most frustrating word processing programs I've ever worked with. I'm used to working with Microsoft Word (which is no catch itself) and, though it is nice that this is compatible with Word, it can't SAVE it as a word document.Forget about editing! Due to glitches in the program, when you hit a reverse tab, your paragraphs end up overlapping on your screen! Incredible, but true! It made editing my resume a complete nightmare. It's workable, but unbelievable that these people can't design something compatible with real world needs. It's not worth upgrading from the 2002 version, either, since the changes are unsubstantial and unimpressive to warrant an ""upgrade"". Run away while you can..."
1,Some unsolicited advice: Don't,"I paid the same amount to upgrade to WP12 that others did who had never used WP before. I was willing to do that (thinking that there would be added features). WP Suite 8 was a great program, and it works with Windows ME, but does not work with XP. My sympathies were with WP for having to catch-up. I purchased a basic WP10 program to continue using WP. Then I purchased WP11, which worked with XP, and I will continue to use it as long as it works - even though I seem to have lost (get a message: not available) a connection to their online HELP. I thought that WP12 would be an improvement - it wasn't. It messed up some of my WP and QuadroPro files even though I said I wanted the WP version. (It supposedly works well with other software programs -maybe so- but it didn't work for me in WP mode.) I uninstalled WP12 and reinstalled WP11. Today I purchased some additional Templates for WP - nothing useful there."
2,No compelling reason to upgrade,"Nothing substantially new here expect for the picture on the box. In other words, there's no real reason to sink money into this product, except to help prop up a company that seems to have lost its ability to innovate.The same old claims (compatibilty with MS, ease of use, etc. are being made, but big deal. Corel has made these claims before.) I can see no real difference between this version and the 2002 suite. I'll pass on the Corel upgrades until they make them worth my time and money."
5,dean edge bass 09,this was my first ever instrument that i owned and am extremely happy with it been playing it since mid 2009. Is a good bass for anyone who is looking to learn how to play as well for anyone who is serious of playing bass and cant afford an expensive one.
4,Great Value,I just started playing the BASS and decided to get this inexpensive one from Amazon($75 Special).With some minor adjustments this BASS guitar is wonderful. The black looks gorgeous.The sound is Good and with some minor tuning it plays quite nice. I really enjoy thisinstrument. Shipping came a day before promised and unscathed.
4,Cold and joyless,"I agree with the previous reviewers that musically this is superlative. However, the set, colours and costumes are so stylised as to be almost sterile; and the choreography of the chorus consists of what seems to be random movement, often at odds with what is going on in the foreground. Despite the efforts of the singers who give it their all, the overall impression is that this is a cold cold production.I find it hard to believe that this is what Monteverdi had in mind when he got his friends together and produced this, the acknowledged first opera. There is no sense of fun, even in the prenuptial scene.I understand that DG/Unitel will soon be releasing the 1978 Harnoncourt production directed by Jean Pierre Ponnelle. I was lucky enough to obtain a video before it was sadly delisted. Whereas the singing is not as high-quality as this production, the orchestra and particularly the concept and direction are much superior. Wait for it, get it and enjoy."
5,REAL Country Music for a Change,"Listening to the Bastard Sons' music makes you want to grab a ice-cold longneck and Belly up to the nearest bar. Mile Markers is some of the band's best stuff and in my opinion ""Road to Bakersfield"" may be one of their best ever which is saying alot. If you're tired of the cookie-cutter type music played on ""country"" stations, give The Bastards a listen! I'll see ya at the bar.""The Honky-tonks have all gone away but Buck and Merle are here to stay, on the Road to Bakersfield""."
3,Classic Byatt story of intrigue and relationships,"One thing I have to say about Byatt's books is that while I'm reading them, I do nothing else. Both this book and Possession were all-nighters for me. Still Life was fun for me because of the Van Gogh connection and seeing one of the characters fall hopelessly in love with a Cambridge don. But when it was all over, I felt empty. The ending is eerily sad, my favorite character remains ungrounded, other characters end up hanging out in strange places, and I ask myself, why bother? Having said all this, I don't hesitate recommending it to any past Byatt reader who wants more tale telling."
5,Terribly good!,"What may be off-putting for some is that the author is British and the book is aimed primarily at a British audience. An audience well read in their literarure, and well versed in their culture of the period, the 1950s.Challenging but all the more interesting and rewarding for those up to the challenge.And there are two more books in the quartet!"
1,It doesnt work with steam if used...,I cant exactly make a review of this game mainly because i bought a used copy. and being a used copy its more than likely already been added to someones Steam. and since that's the case i cant play it... Do not buy used!
1,Steam do not buy,"This version has steam, If you buy it in only a few years steam will be gone and your game is toast. SINCE it has to connect to the internet to make sure your the only copy using that code. You can only play a few offline games befour it askes you to connect. BUT it has to connect at least once to get the real cd key. The real key is stored at steam. You do not own this game when you buy it. Your just renting it. Alot of companys have done this in the past and when they go out of busniss you just have another coster. DO NOT BUY there are version of this game that have no steam! Im so stupid for buying this copy. Half life 2 is the same. Buy that on xbox and you will not have to deal with steam."
1,Made Me Nauseous!,"After all the hype about this game, I finally picked up a copy. I play a lot of computer games, and have played a few first person shooters, but after about 10 minutes of this game, I felt like I had to throw up. I tried again the next day and had the same reaction. Perhaps it is the realistic motion and physical effects, that everyone raves about, but playing this game actually made me feel sick! You might wanted to avoid this game (or at least keep a supply of dramamine on hand) if you are prone to motion sickness =)"
2,Hopelessly out of date,After playing the excellent Half Life 2 and it's sequel Episode One. I decided to blindly purchase this earlier Anthalogy. What a mistake. This game feels like it belongs on an Atari 2600 as the graphics and sound are an embarrassment to behold. Either remake this game or send it out to pasture. What a relic.
3,This box isn't that bad.,"I just bought this game yesterday, and when I got online and looked at some of the reviews I was a little worried about how well it would play, due to the Steam game engine. The fact that it only comes with one cd-rom disc for 4 games also had me a little concerned.However, once everything was installed, there's been no problems. Despite what some reviews might say, you CAN PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE.Once you've installed the game, and set up your Steam account, put in the cd key, etc. you can simply click the game icon and the steam account will try to start up, but once it realises you're not online it'll give you the option of playing in offline mode.My computer didn't suffer any lags or gameplay problems, so aside from the fact that setting up the Steam account and downloading the updates will take almost 3 hours on a 56k.For the price, it's a good deal. just don't be surprised when you can't play it right out of the box."
4,Fun [],"The only reason this book didn't get 5 stars is because it's not that long of a book and I wanted more. This is a fun and creepy tale of halloween and moutain folk, incest and inbreeding.I didn't want it to end. Cemetery Dance did a wonderful job on the book and it is a great add to any collection. Ray Garton gives us a simple tale that will stick with you long after your done reading it.A good buy and good read."
4,Robin Hood: The Art of Shooting Rich People,"I just bought the full version of Robin Hood: Legend of Sherwood, (I suggest downloading the demo from fileplanet). The game is addictive and fun, but to be honest it is pretty silly. Even though I'm 25, there's still something about Robin Hood the legend that applies to me and it was enough to get me to play the demo anyway! If you too enjoy the basic philosophy of shooting rich people for fun and profit then buy this game, there sure is no end to the number of times you're gonna tag someone in the face for three gold pieces! Or as Will Scarlet you can literally sneak up behind 90% of the guards/soldiers and strangle them to death! (not a game for kids!)"
1,IAM THE ONLY ONE!!!!,IN 1991 MY ALIEN RELATIVE WENT TO NJ AND BOUGHT THIS CD FOR ME. I REALLY LIKE IT.IT WAS ROMANTIC BETTER THAN NKOTB.COOL GUYS WITH COOL MUSIC.I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE GUYS BUT THAT DOESNT MATTER COZ THEIR CD IS OUT OF ORDER NOW RIGHT. BUT I HAVE IT IF YOU ARE NTERESTED MY EMAL S keremyolac@hotmail.com.
4,Quite satisfied.,"MY opinion..briefly,Good: Bright screen, Thin and light, Clear hearing, Loud speaker phone, Rigid body (droped it from my pocket on the road but only some scratches)Not good: There is no 'ring AFTER vibration' option. You need a connector for earphone. Categorizing your contact in a 'group' is very limited by the number. You can have only tens of people in the group you named.Beautifully shiny but it is subject to finger prints and grease from your hand. If you are a sort of detective 'Monk' person, you won't like this. :)"
1,Don't even consider this phone,"Nothing but trouble and underwhelming performance. I'm stuck with this turd for 6 more months, and don't know that it'll make it until the weekend. Have never dropped or abused it or gotten it wet...I'm perplexed. Expected an LG product to be much higher quality. Very disappointed. I'm a former Verizon sales rep, so I know a few things about phones. Sadly, what I've learned about this one comes too late and not without cost.The LG VX8600 = POS!!"
2,Long term review,Something to look out for:The ONLY way to charge this phone is through a delicate data port on the left side. The problem is this WILL get damaged and you WON'T be able to charge your phone. If you have a warranty they will try and claim that you were talking on the phone while it was charging and try to deny your claim. I had the insurance and ended up having to get a refurb phone for $50. After this I was very careful with the charging port; but it happened a SECOND time with the new phone about 6 months later.I don't know why it's so hard to put two solid tabs on the back of the battery and give the user an alternative means of charging the phone.
3,Beautiful but not useful,"The LG VX8600 is a great looking phone, with its glossy finish (does leave fingerprints easily, but that is expected) but overall I wasn't that happy with it. What I loved the most was the slim design that made me double check to see if it was actually in my pocket. The disadvantage was the not so great battery life and my biggest gripe was the horrible reception (my previous phone, a Motorola E815 would stay connected in the same locations that this phone would drop calls).Pros:Beautiful glossy lookSlim design fits easily in pocketFeatures (MP3, etc)sturdy - dropped it twice, worked fineCons:Battery life dropped off quicklyHorrible receptionSpeakerphone not that greatRequired an adapter for headsetI would most definetly not have purchased this phone if I got to test it out first.I only give it three stars because I loved how thin it was and I figure you can only expect so much from such a slim phone."
2,Overall bad choice,"When I bought this phone it was recommended by a friend. Initially it worked great, but over time I noticed that I am constantly in and out of serive areas and it drops calls all the time.It's a waste of money. Only part of it that works well is the MP3 player."
1,"Loud, hard to read and annoying speakerphone","Ok, this phone is pretty sleek looking. It has an amazing art screensaver wallpaper that blows my mind. The wallpaper is awesome, but I'm still going to go trade this phone in.I have 3 major problems with this phone:-the earpiece is so loud even on the lowest setting. we aren't all hard of hearing but I think everyone at LG must be.-I had to google how to turn on the speaker-phone (it's not in the manual) and it can only be activated when in a call. Unlike the earpiece the speaker-phone is really quiet.-You cannot read the screen in the sun very well. It's possible at the right angle.I'm going to try the Samsung u740. I hope it's better. I'm going to miss that van gogh and other artists wallpaper though."
1,"Awful, Flimsy Phone","I received this as a first phone for Christmas, and since then I have been very unhappy. It is extremely unreliable, and has broken down 3 times in six months. Also, it is absurd ly flimsy, and, overall, is a rip off."
1,Beware of its Bluetooth,"Bought this at a verizon store and it looked and worked great. within an hour the bluetooth headset (LG) stopped producing audio. After testing a different headset (Plantronics) the store determined that phone was bad. The second phone seemed to set up OK, but static made the bluetooth unusable. Returned it and am currently searching for another brand. Expect this one will have a recall on it soon. Other than that the features seemed really cool. Opening the phone seemed awkward, had to open from sides."
2,Charger port is wimpy,"I really like this phone, it's great looking, functional and slim (fits in my pocket). I have now been through two of them, though, and have had the same problem with both. The charger port gets weak and stops charging the phone! I wish there was a desk-top battery charger or something that would charge the battery-only, because the port wears out, and then the phone is useless. The first phone was replaced under warranty, but I don't have the patience to change phones every six months. Going to a Motorola this time..."
3,"Nice design, size","I needed a new cell phone right away and after researching www.bestbuy.com I ran out to by this version of the LG. It's a very sleek phone and easily fits in your jeans pocket. The interface is fairly intuitive. My biggest complaints are that the sound quality seems a bit subpar and the lowest volume setting for the earpiece isn't low enough. But overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone."
3,"Lots of good info, hard to navigate","This book is very informative, however, it's not so pleasing to the eye. Navigation is difficult and no color pictures or maps. If you are looking for ""secret"" spots and enjoy easy to read maps, then look elsewhere. If you can look beyond the appearance of the book, then this book has some good information for you."
4,I knew it!,"I knew that silly covers record had to be a fluke. Paul is back! Thank God! Just saw him live at The Vic in Chicago too-brilliant. Thank you, thank you, thank you Paul."
3,Enjoyable...but......,"I am a HUGE fan of the Queen of Soul!!! I was excited to get this tape as I did miss the time when Soundstage presented the concert on the air. This presentation shows Aretha looking good, although I agree with one poster that she looks at some points like she does not want to sing, but then again, 1985 was a hard time for her personally as her Father had passed away the year prior. I was slightly disappointed at the medley of her biggest hits and the way she railroaded through them. Something He Can Feel - major high point of the show. LOVED the version of Ain't No Way and Love All the Hurt Away, the ad-lib on Love All was priceless when she said she was going to put on a pot of greens and hot water cornbread etc...Classic Aretha right there. All in all, a nice show, some parts could have been better, but the Queen shined"
2,Bad buy,I bought this think it would make things easier with newborn and all well they weren't very useful and what a waste of money. It's much easier to use cotton swabs and alcohol.
3,"Great collection of photos, but......","Wow,the photos in the book were great but I have a bone to pick. The author says these were photographed by the soldiers. Then what about all the inhumane crimes committed by the Wehrmacht and all the photographs taken by its sadistic soldiers. Look no further than the book ""German Army and Genocide"" for them. Also, the author obviously has a pro-German bias. He describes the Russian soldiers as ""Reds""- this is not the Russian civil war! One of the pictures describes the 'fanatic' resistance at Brest-Litvosk while always describing the 'heroics' of the Germans. Also he uses the German spelling for Soviet cities: Lemberg, Moskau, etc. There are also several errors by labeling General Vassili Chuikov (the hero of Stalingrad) as General Zhukov. Still the book is a great collection of photos."
4,Love it!,"I gave this set a four star rating because I think Stott Pilates are the best pilate DVDs that I personally have used. I have tried four other types and Stott pilates leaves you sweating and feeling like you have had a real work out. Good instruction through the session as well. The Total Body Sculpting DVD is with the flex band and is a good work out but not as intense as the Secret to Toned Arms, Buns and Thighs DVD which gets things really burning! I didn't realise what the Essential Reformer 3rd edition DVD was about and it is no good to me as you require equipment that I don't have and is probably aimed at very advanced users or potential instructors. Myself, I would probably have just bought the Secret to Toned Arms, Buns and Thighs DVD knowing what I know now. :-)"
3,average,I am disappointed in this DVD set. I don't really feel like I got a workout. I chose STOTT pilates because they had the best reviews for instruction and exercises. I feel like I've gotten a better workout from Pilates for Dummies!
3,It's ok,"I thought the DVDs would be more of a workout then they turned out to be. I do think they've helped me tone a bit, but other than that I wish I would've picked something with a bit more cardio."
2,"Easily The Worst, Thankfully The Last","I've been the biggest fan of the Saw series from the beginning. Even IV through VI I enjoyed more than most. The series really should have never gone past III, but I admired the way they were able to keep it interesting afterwards, even if they were grasping at straws by VI. VII is the final chapter and thankfully so because the acting and special effects are the worst yet by far. What story there was, was ruined by poor acting. On top of that the special effects, especially in the first trap we see at the beginning of the movie, are cheesy at best. The blood for whatever reason looked pink, which made it totally unrealistic looking. I really wanted this to end well, but sadly it didn't. Thankfully it won't get any worse from here out."
5,Not The Final chapter,"This can't be the last saw not the way they left it off. if it is i'm sad saw is awesome. Saw 3d was good but the 3d was not that good i was expecting more killing in 3d, oh well the movie was awesome though. love it"
2,Ripped off!,"Got this DVD today and watched it. Movie was OK, but the DVD version was sadly lacking. The best parts - the making of the traps and other special features - are on the Blu-Ray version ONLY. Since I do not have a blu-ray player, I don't get to see them? The marketers of this combo pack must also have a hand in blu-ray sales. Very disappointed."
2,Saw,Decent flick. Good ending to the franchise but was very sloppy filmmaking and no where near the best of the franchise.
2,dissapointing end to an otherwise entertaining series...,"The Saw series has had it's up and downs... Mostly it has retained enough entertainment to keep viewers coming back. The weakest of them being Saw V. Saw Vi came back with a great amount of steam...So I anticipated the end of the story to be just as good. But no a dissapointing full circle plot. This film was condensed from two films and rushed. Jigsaw has a minor role in the film though his cameo is a pleasant one, it does not feel like a Saw movie. It feels like a watered down version of a flashy slasher flick. I hope they do make 8 just to make up for how uncreative this installment is.."
4,good,"Great delivery...good flick ties up the saw franchise, but a little cheesy, could have been better, but otherwise decent flick. but personally i like better all the ones before this."
5,Just as good as the Rest,"Ok, some of the actors are lacking as they do in some of the other sequels, but the story & intensity is as good as the rest & as always NEW TRAPS so considering they managed to make 7 great movies I gave it 5 stars despite the acting."
3,There Will Be Pink Blood,"I'll keep this review simple, since it is after all the seventh film in the SAW series. Since 2004, I've made the trek to my local theater to see what Jigsaw had in store, but it's become more of a chore with each passing year. The first three movies were the best, but these last two are worthy sequels. I didn't care much for IV or V. The acting this time around is okay and story doesn't lag too much, but I have to say that the traps and gore level is probably the highest of all the films. If only the blood didn't look so cheap, with a noticeable pinkish hue, I think I would have had a harder time not turning away from the carnage. There are a couple of twists that I won't spoil, but the major one was predicted more than a few movies ago by most SAW fans. Still, it is pretty neat and will hopefully wrap up these movies for good.The 3-D wasn't really needed, but it did have a couple of body parts flying through the air moments to shine."
3,No Unrated Version On DVD,I've been a fan of the Saw series since it began and looked forward to the Unrated versions when they were released on DVD. Saw VII was released in an R rated version only on DVD and is a real let down.
2,A Sad End,"What makes the Saw movies interesting aren't the traps or gore, but Tobin Bell's Jigsaw. The moral complexity. The questions of what a person will do to survive. It was a kind gross out vigilante horror film and it worked. Saw: The Final Chapter loses that little complexity that the franchise has, and lacks any coherent story. There are no clever tricks in the narrative, no real gotcha moment that were present in earlier entries of this series. It's simply gave in to being torture porn and that's all you get. Trap after trap that can't be beaten, each one grosser than its predecessor. The films were never genius film-making, but there was always a subversive sense of fun in Jigsaw's traps being a kind vigilante justice. With that gone, all that's left is the morbid effects. Effects don't make a movie, and as a movie, this is a lousy one. Even hardcore fans should be wary. There's nothing here worth watching."
3,Saw Final Chapter,Price was great but movie was perdictable. If freinds asked me if they should buy it I would tell them to wait for it to be in Walmart's $5 bin. I baught it to complete my Saw movie collection.
1,Poor Video Quality,"I did not even finish watching this rental due to the poor streaming quality. I was also not able to rent the movie made prior to this, so viewing it was out of order from the series."
2,This is where the Saw series goes completely down the drain !,"From the pink blood to the horrible 3D, this movies just plain sucks, and let's not forget about the bad acting! Hopefully they finally get it now and just quit with this series, like they should of done after the third one. I gave out 2 stars just for the comedy, though I don't think it was intentional."
4,I have to watch the other 6 flicks again!,"It was a great movie---to me it followed the story line well.I have to watch the other 6 movies again in order to follow the story better!I had a great time watching the movie, and there is a sense of satisfaction in completing the collection. --- I have them ALL!"
1,Unfotunate that the unrated version wont be on dvd,The dvd is going to be the r rated cut.Only the blu ray will be the unrated version.It is good if you have a bluray player but at this time I still only have a dvd player.In my opinion it is a ploy to try to make people buy bluray.They are doing the same thing with the town bluray dvd releases.It sucks for us who cant afford to switch to bluray.
3,Saw is borderline into the B-movie category with 3D added on,I have enjoyed the Saw series for some time but the specialty of the series is definitely worn off. I've felt this way for the last couple of Saw movies but thought I would give this one a buy for the 3D effect since there are so few 3D movies out. The movie was just OK. I will most likely not watch it again but I am not an uber fan. It has it's twists and the scenarios are original and a throwback at the same time.3D- I would rate the 3D effect at a 3. There were times that it was really neat but they were very few and far in between. It lacked the depth I've seen in other live action 3D films. There were times with the lighting that it completely washed the scenes out and I thought it was completely unacceptable.Bottom Line. If your a Saw fan you probably aren't reading this and you probably already have the movie. If you are still interested I would say rent it.
2,Total garbage until the last 15 minutes,"Most of this movie was so bad I'm not going to waste much time on this review because the movie itself already did that for me, so I'm just gonna put into bullet points why this movie sucks:- pink blood- traps were mostly stupid- acting was roughly as good as a soap opera- most of the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the other sixThe only saving grace of this movie is the last 15 minutes of the movie where they try to wrap up the other six. It could've easily been tacked onto to the end of Saw 6 though.Uggghhh..."
1,FIFTY-NINE DOLLARS!!!?????,"Sorry, but this rating is for the outrageous price Amazon is selling this for... $59.95 in the USA (as of the writing of this review). Just a few weeks ago it was selling for $35.95...WTF???!!!!! My best investment was to purchase a multi-region Oppo brand Blu-ray 3D player... IT PLAYS EVERYTHING!!So, I bought this SAW FINAL CHAPTER Blu-ray 3D version from the Amazon.co.uk site for 7.00(GBP)... that's about $10.92(USD). The 3D is great!If you like 3D? EXPAND YOUR VIEWING/PURCHASE OPTIONS like I did and I'm sure you'll be happy to find other savings like... SANCTUM 3D for 7.99, THE HOLE for 8.99 and, PIRANHA 3D for 4.99 (not the best movie, but for that price...???)"
1,Honest review,"This last movie had a some what good plot, however I agree with most that the filming was done in a very cheap manner. I bought this specifically for the 3d, and to be honest it was everything but 3d. Very little effects leaves you unhappy after paying $40 at the local store. If you want to see this movie rent it and save your cash, not worth keeping. Most of all do not expect a good 3d experience at all, I thought it was me at first but have read the same thing in other peoples reviews. I hope this helps"
5,SAW legacy huge finale,"This film was excellent. As was the entire SAW series.......this just was a great way to end it. Hey,theese are my opinions...you may not like them all. I do. But this one in my view is the best. The SAW series is famous for plot twists. This one has the biggest one of all. And it actually makes more sense of the other movies. Check this out....rent it first if you want. Then buy it....like I did. (I didn't rent it;though I caught in the theaters.) Great xcast feaeturing;Sean Patrick Flanery. So....if you love SAW......you'll love how it ends."
3,Same Saw as usual,"Well well, let's hope this was the last one. Somehow, the traps repeat themselvs. Although the story of the last one is not bad, it is a ""have-seen-before"" thing. To complete the series."
4,SAW 3D blu ray,"SAW ends well - plenty gory enough for any SAW fan - the one thing that disappointed me the most is that what the product does NOT tell you is that the 3D is designed for the newer 3D tvs & you need the active shutter glasses -- it was advertised in a way I thought it was like the My Bloody Valentine that came out 2 years ago, it came with the old type 3D glasses that gave you great 3D eperience -- the Blu Ray will still work great with ANY Blu Ray player but, will default to 2D unless you have player capable of 3D - you will still get a gorgeous picture BUT, unless you are set up with new 3D system don't expect to see any of that."
3,The Final Chapter,"What can I say that's not already been said. I have read what most of the faithful Saw fans stated about Final Chapter before seeing the movie. I must say that they were dead on. I wanted to see more of Jigsaw, the pink looking blood was beneath the quality of the Saw series, but I did enjoy the final twists. Game over."
5,Saw- The Phennomenal Chapter,"I have enjoyed the entire Saw series. I liked the first one and this one the best in the series. A good addition to the Saw movies. Lots of pain and blood and the story ends the series in a way that makes sense. If you enjoy the Saw movies, you need to see this one. Just Great..."
5,No m ha llegado el producto.,"Hola Amazon.Com, no m ha llegado mi pedido y éste ya tiene más d 2 meses d k fué hecho, ojalá k c remedie ésta situación puesto k el cargo ya fué hecho a mi tarjeta. Ya pregunté con mi cartero y en la oficina d correos y no tienen idea al respecto d ningún paquete a mi nombre. Muchas Gracias y Espero Noticias."
3,Same old same old,Just more of the same in the Saw series. If you're a fan of the series it's worth a watch.
3,A weak ending for a strong franchise,"I hope I speak for every Saw fan when I say that for the Final Chapter I would have envisioned something else and bigger than this. I thought that the series would go out with a big bang, instead we saw just another one (you had the feeling that this is Part 15 of the series, with all it's charm and oroginality gone out of the window). The opening sequence was quite funny as were all the other deaths in this (and in every entry) but for the big finale we would have expected something different."
2,Disappointing,"I'll admit that I didn't see the preceding 2 movies, so I was a little lost about the continuity, but overall I was pretty disappointed by this one. I thought some of the murder gags were too overdone. Also, the general picture quality reminded me of a made for TV movie."
2,Not that Great!!!,"I had a hard time reading this book. I did not like the characters, they sounded great on the back of the book, but, I sure thought they fizzled in real life.It sounds kind of racy, but they really don't have sex 'til later in the book, and I just can not get excited about to what my way of thinking of is a gigalo or male prostitute. In the future they have the sex super bowl where teams of guys bring women to orgasm, pretty much whoever does the most the fastest wins. Just did not appeal to me.I did not find it amusing, but it did pass the time, not pleasurably, but I did not have anything else to read. I would pass on this book altogether, unless you are really curious, but don't buy new."
3,Not as Good as it Should Have Been,"From the synopsis, this book had great potential. It is definitely an enjoyable read, and a light read, but with such a great premise, it should have been so much more. I felt there was too little chemistry between Brian and Ally, and that his profession--the way it was explained in the begining of the book--was very unerotic and belittling of women in general. Still, if you stick with the book, it gets better (especially after Ally experiences a virtual reality replay of Brian's latest game -- at least you can understand why a woman would play the game.) Try it if you've run out of things to read."
1,I would give it a zero if I could,"Where to begin? This book was horrible. It was silly and trite and just plain boring. I forced myself to finish it because I aim to finish every book I start, but this one taxed me. It's a shame too because I have read some of Ms. Bang's short stories and they weren't bad at all. This could have been so much better."
1,great for the male prostitution lovers out there...,"there are millions of great books out there. Please do not waste your time on this horribly written book which would make ""fluff"" romances look like Hamlet.Sex as a spectator sport-the guy's the MVP? His ""team"" is called-get this-The Testosterone Titans! Oh my goodness-so bad. If the lead were a woman, we women would consider this porn-and badly written porn at that. Please do yourself a favor and skip this mess.no stars."
5,Inspirational and practical,"This book is a great resource for anyone who is making or has made the transition from traditional to freely expressed quilts. The author gives really clear instructions on how to form curves in both the quilt construction and the borders. The curves are all done with the topstitched method, using freezer paper, so there is no seam matching. Her own quilts are colourful and exuberant, and her passion comes through on every page. There are very clear instructions at each stage, and patterns for three small quilts to try out some of the ideas. It would not be suitable for complete beginners, but is not scarily difficult."
5,Great cable company,"This product does what it's supposed to do and does it very well. Before using, I asked a friend to use his test equipment to tell me which side had better signal, sad to say there were no favorites, they were both very close to each other and my friend's reference connection had the same readings. Cool, love it, great build, great look, and does what I want it do to."
4,Very well loved George!,"My nephew is a big Fan of Firemen. Despite the fact that he's just two, he's crazy about being a pretend Firefighter. For his birthday his Aunt and I unknowingly both had this Curious George shipped to him. He was so excited to have 2 Georges that could help him be a firefighter! So apparently 2 is better than 1! This George gets 2 thumbs up from Hayden Age 2!"
2,Curious George Plush,"The Curious George Plush ordered arrived in a timely manner, however, the condition of the plush did not meet my expectations. It came with tags, however, the tag was very dirty, the nylon fabric on the clothing was snagged, the thread connecting the hat to the monkey was broken, and the plush on the face was dirty...just not suitable for gift giving. I returned the plush and was promptly credited. Therefore, I have no major complaints other than the condition of the plush."
3,"Maybe good for a reference, but not the best first source","I am a engineering/physics student, and I used this book for a first year graduate course in statistical mechanics. The book contains a lot of information, and the chapters are extremely concise. In this, lies both the strengths and weaknesses of the book. I think that the short, too the point writing style makes this book an excellent reference. However, the relatively small amount of exposition made it hard to learn material for the first time from the book. Overall, I would not suggest this book as a first introduction to the subject. But i think that it could be a usefull reference for someone with some background in the subject."
1,Terse and unhelpful - a dreadful book - avoid like the plague!,"I was forced to use this singularly unhelpful book in graduate school. It was written in a terse, indigestible style; contained very few worked problems; left many important derivations or steps of derivations to the reader; had impossibly hard end-of-chapter problems - without solutions; and contained many typographical errors. Perhaps, as other reviewers have suggested, it would have been more helpful as a research reference, or as a textbook for students with a very strong background in undergraduate statistical thermodynamics. Do not attempt to use this book to learn statistical mechanics for the first time!This review refers to the first edition."
4,2 Books in one,"This is a good book, but it's not a graduate text for the first half. If you're just reading it and not taking the class, buy Hill instead (it's $10). McQuarrie learned how to teach SM from Hill and it shows. The second half is a whole different story. It's research level material, but is perhaps out of date. Lastly, Karl Freed and Stuart Rice teach from this book, which should be worth far more than my review."
2,good for the price?,In the picture the stone protrudes. it is just flat. Not real excited about that. And it's tiny. I was expecting a little bigger.
2,WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BLAKE LEWIS IN IT?,"I really really wonder if this cd was ""supposed"" to have blake lewis in it... i searched Blake Lewis and this came up.. maybe just because he beat boxes"
4,A Good Mixture,"This cd mixes electronica,Mexican,Gypsy and polka into a really amazing sound that you can tap your foot to. I would suggest you pick this up if you are into Gogol Bordello,Flogging Molly or Los Cubanos Postizos its kind of a mix of all of them...Buy It!"
5,Amazon's Awesome!!,I had a favorite cassette of Andy Griggs....I bought a new Bose system and am trying to upgrade all my cassettes to DVD's. I started with Andy. Amazon had exactly what I wanted! So I ordered 2! One is a birthday present for my mom....she's gonna love it!! Thank you Amazon.com...you have everything!!!
4,sings with clarity and power,"a great new talent ! after hearing the title track, you can't help being impressed by the young man's very direct singing style, and a seeming wisdom beyond his years."
1,What in the world is this,Half way through this video I had to go stick my head in the porcelaine throne and make myself throw up. This guy looks more like Kurt Cocainebain than a country music singer. Where in the hell did Nashville find this guy. Somebody in Tennessee has got their head up their butt.
3,Okay,"All except Joan Hickson were not great actors. As for the story,the movie goes by the book.This movie was very suspenceful and thoroughly engrossing."

5,WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?,"This is exactly what the doctor ordered for a summer read. I couldn't have enjoyed it more - in fact, I liked this one better than the first! Isn't it great when you get so incredibly caught up in a book that you're thinking of it even when you're not actually reading? Exactly what happened for me. This is going to be my gift book for some time to come.I sincerely hope there is another installment. I want to stay in touch with all the guys in the book. Read it - you'll love it!"
1,Maybe you had to be there,"The usual deadly sins-- updated for the TiVO set--describing a loser's perfect self-indulgence. Oh yes, a loser who does not have to work because he's living off of someone else's money. What is even more annoying are the ""Comparative Religions 101 LIGHT"" snippets and the (largely unsuccessful) attempts at seeming mature, reflective, and deep. Groan. I'm not tempted to read the prequel."
3,Nonfiction writer returns to fiction,"William J. Mann traverses fiction as comfortably as he does nonfiction. This time Mann focuses his reporter's eye on a culture determined to forget reality -- gay circuit party life. Mann's career has been versatile: Hollywood biographies, newspaper/magazine journalism, beach-blanket page-turners, and horror fiction. He keeps you guessing what will be next!"
5,This Book Touched Me,"After reading this book in one sitting I was left with the feeling of being understood. To often in my life I have been misunderstood, to often I have been placed in stereotypes that did not quite fit who I was. The characters in this book are not stereotypical, the dialogue is not stereotypical. William J Mann has a mastery of dialogue that brings forth seven very different very unique characters. I have since purchased copies for my mother, and other good friends telling them ""This is the world I belong to!"" They too have been surprised at how enjoyable this book is to read. This is a definate must in anyone's library gay, straight, bi, transgender, or questioning. When it comes down to it 'Where the Boys Are' is simply a fun read."
4,Fun journal for cat lovers,"I love Hayde Ardalan's drawings of Milton...he's such a typical tuxedo cat, from his big round eyes to his beguiling whiskers and velvety paws. This is a nice journal with a spiral binding so it opens and lies flat, good quality paper with black lines for easy writing, and on many of the pages, cute images of Milton. I use it as my Weight Watchers journal...it makes it fun every day to open it up and see if there's a picture of Milton! (and a mouse friend)."
1,Red is not worth it,"This is a total waste of your money, it looks like a great idea, but does not make for a workout. If you really want to buy excersize equiptment, don't buy this."
3,eh...,"It came very fast. It's pretty cool at first. It doesn't seem like you are getting much of a work out if you're not on it for at least 45 mins. But it is fun, easy to use, and easy to assemble. Works good as an office seat so you can type and exercise at the same time."
4,Good Product and Good Value,I purchased this product not sure if it would be of very good quality. I was wrong. It was very well put together and sturdy. I found the video to be very helpful and easy to understand and keep up with. This exerciser is good for someone who hasn't exercised in awhile and needs to get moving again. I have back and knee problems and this was something that I can do without hurting myself. Iwould recommend this product and would buy it again!
1,Poor Customer Service,"I rec'd the exerciser about a montha ago...am not able to use it because the 4 screws that hold on the handles were missing...I have had no luck trying to obtain these screws from Target, I get the unaround ....if I return it ...I am out the $14 shipping....The company needs to make good on this product, but I am at a loss where to contact to get these screws I need...."
2,save your money,"Do yourself a favor and save your money. I hate crunches and thought this machine might be a way to get easier results, but it's a joke. I do crunches for about 10-15 minutes before I work out. If I do them right, I'm sore the next day. The problem is, I hate every minute of them. I bought this machine and used it for nearly 30 minutes. My legs hurt from holding them out but I felt nothing in my abs. Nothing. I turned the resistance all the way up too. Also, the DVD that comes with it is a joke as well. Where did they dig up this George Pou guy? Terrible. The ONLY way I could see this machine doing you any good is if you don't work out at all and are totally out of shape. In that case, I suppose a little is better than nothing. But do yourself a favor, save your $$$$, lie down on the floor, suck it up and squeeze out some highly effective, FREE crunches. PS...I gave it 2 stars by accident and couldn't fix...it doesn't even deserve one."
2,Could have done better,"I was given this for a Christmas gift, but I think the money could have been better spent on a regular weight bench and free weights. I would have used that much more than I do this thing. It really does not give me the workout that I was used to having. The equipment is rather sturdy for what you spend, but I don't think you get enough of a workout for the money you spend. As for the DVD that came with it....it really sucked big time! The mouths didn't match up with the video itself which was VERY distracting. The video reminded you of an old 1960 instructional video. All in all, I was was VERY disappointed in the merchandise. I will be going back to my Tae-Bo and look to buy a real weight set and bench for a true workout. All in all, save your money!"
3,fun to use,"My wife wanted this really badly, and used it quite a bit for the first few weeks we had it. It also makes a nice place to sit in front of the computer."
5,Gentle Exercise,I really like my Red Exerciser and recommend it. It's perfect for older people and people who don't want to go to a gym.
2,product good-results-what results?,"There is no way that you can achieve what it promises with this product.it seems to be well built & sturdy- but i have read & re-read, watched dvd - i am now certain that i am doing it right in every way BUT there is no way this will change the way my body looks in any way.it is now under my bed (stores well- breaks down fairly flat!) and i have joined a gym.good luck!"
1,"Broke after 15 minutes! Plus the DVD isn't too good, either.","I've never written an Amazon review before, but wanted to send out a warning on this product. I bought this at Kohl's last night for $43. I made it through the DVD, but didn't feel anything in my abdominal section after it was over. I can say that it didn't put any strain on my neck, so it would be good for someone who is limited to what ab workouts they can do because of neck pain.After I was done, my husband gave it a try. He's just under 200 pounds (far below the weight limit) and after about 15 minutes into his DVD workout, the seat completely snapped off.The included DVD isn't very motivating, either. I returned the whole thing today and will save my money for something better.At least he & I will have a lifetime of jokes from this experience: ""What's your favorite color?"""
2,no resistance,It does not tighten to increase resistance.It is nothing but a stool with handle to twist the body from right to left. It is a big disappointment.
3,ok product,Just got it. Not sure if it is going to work. It is easy to assemble it. Tends to agree with someone on the fact that the tension is not that strong as you may think even when it is adjusted to the highest level.
1,I already gave this thing an appropriately bad review -once-. I want my 'helpful' votes back!,"Apparently they have enough clout to make the bad reviews disappear...ok, try try again: Ninety Percent of the benefit that you might get from this machine is from lifting your feet off of the floor. The twisting may feel somewhat strenuous, but it's because of the tension created by your feet/legs being lifted up , not the twisting itself. In other words; you don't need this machine, you don't need anything, just sit anywhere with your feet suspended off of the floor. A little twist wouldn't hurt.....got a swivel chair? That's all this thing is, and not a very good one."
4,A Satisfied Customer,"After reading about so many people's negative experience with this little machine, it might seem strange that I'm very happy with it. All the parts arrived in proper condition, assembly was easy. The basic workout DVD is a good start for someone my age (62). Mr. Pou is obviously a body builder and not a TV personality, but I'm excercising, not looking to be entertained. I've only been using it a short period of time but already see and feel results. I work up a moderate sweat, and keep the tension on it's tightest all the time. I also like to just sit and swing on it while watching t.v. My waist is getting smaller and I am tightening up. So far it's delivering what I was looking for. I have a tricky neck from a childhood whiplash and a bulging disc in my lower back. I am able to do crunches now without hurting either my back or my neck. So, I extend my sympathies to those who are not pleased or received defective equipment. But here is at least one, bona fide satisfied customer."
2,Not suited for anyone on the shorter side,"I really liked the basic idea of this swivel stool, but I am a 5' 3"" female and to use this product sitting you must be a taller person with longer arms."
2,red xl not worth the money,Bought this on sale for around 75 bucks. used it a few times and noticed it was already wearing down. it did not glide like it did when I first used it. I am only 140 pounds. While it did help tone my abs the tightening for a harder workout is junk.Don't waste your money
3,red exercise manchine,I received the red exerciser chair in a timly manner but the resistance on the chair is not all that good.
2,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,I purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas last year and now it's broken ALREADY. Mind you neither of us are overweight- He's 5.10 and only weighs 160 MAYBE- I'm 5.8 and only weigh 150. The sit barely moves any more the black belt looking this is breaking off. It's a terrible buy.
2,"Not the best, but it was priced cheap","I got this at a sports dicounter for $45, after having it for a few weeks, I have to say using this is better than sitting in a recliner and eating while watching TV. I switch up how I hold the handles and you can really feel the difference in your arms. The quality is only so-so, but I weigh 250 lbs. and it's holding up fine for me (so far). Just know going in that you get what you pay for. It also can serve as a back-up chair. Like I said, there's a lot worse out ther for more money than this was."
3,Easy to use,"Red Exerciser was pretty much what I expected. It's nothing high-tech or amazing, but it does help target your core. It's easy to use & doesn't hurt my back. Amazon had a better price on this product than the manufacturer's website."
1,Lame Ab Workout,"This is a boring ab workout machine. It works your abs some but does not entice. The next ab assistant I'll be getting is one of the big workout balls. I had one before and my daughter took sissors to it. Many more excersies with the ball, virtually as many as you can think of. But this piece of equipment is totally lame. The video that goes with it is absolute crap as well. A big buff guy and two hot chicks who he bosses around and tells them how rich he is because of suckers like me buying his stupid product."
3,item does not match description,description says XL but a DX was sent to us.other than that everything was ok.
3,"Bought as a gift, thinking of getting one myself","My mother saw this on television and wanted one for Christmas. With her health issues she cannot do high impact exercise and wanted something she could do at home. She really seems to like it and I am considering purchasing one myself. Obviously it isn't a machine for someone who does a lot of working out and exercise, but for someone like us, who doesn't and realizes that we need to find some way to do some exercise, it works well. My plan is to put it right in my living room and use it while I watch tv! I've tried that at my mom's and I really liked it. An added bonus is that I got it here on Amazon for about half the price it would have been anywhere else."
3,reviewing it,"its a good piece of equipment,,, HOWERVEr you must be re-tightening the nuts on the handles,, or else ill turn loose too quick. Good for someone not heavy"
5,A great little exerciser,This is a great little workout for the abs. It's easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of space. I love it.
2,bad toy,After charging the battery and getting it ready to play with i was unable to get the bike to work once i did it was fun as long as you went straight but to turn you need a wide open parking lot to make the turn. when i seen this on tv i thought my son would have fun but when you need a football field to play with it that was no fun. And now i can't even get it to work. i will be sending this back and letting my son pick something else out
1,Misleading Advertising,"I disagree with the review stating Amazon and Toys R'Us ""clearly"" stated you needed a seperate battery pack to make this thing work. All it said was two AA batteries. As far as how it works??? I wouldn't know, on Christmas Morning I didn't have the battery pack so my son who this was for was not able to play with it. I am going to return it as I feel I was mislead by Tyco, Toys R'Us, and Amazon."
5,great !!!,"El producto llego rapido, la calidad del producto llego en perfectas condicionse. Estoy muy contenta del servicio y definitivamente volveria a usar el servicio...Gracias!!!"
4,A great introduction to a powerful progressive rock band.,"I would probably recommend this disc as a perfect introduction to the band Curved Air, for it features solid tracks from throughout their years (and various line-ups). I actually strongly prefer the live performances of some of these songs to the album versions, for they feel much more alive and full of energy. Collected from four BBC recordings from 1970 through 1976, they showcase singer Sonja Kristina's unique vocals perfectly, as well as the strong musicianship of the rest of the band. Stand-out tracks to me are the intense version of ""Propositions"" and a terrific version of ""Midnight Wire"". Even though they are culled from different years and performances, the album has a nice coherence to it and is a worthwhile addition to any progressive rock collection."
1,Boring.,"I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and was excited to get this book, which would give me insight into the history of 'my people'. Unfortunately, it's a snooze - dry, with references to all kinds of historical figures that I know nothing about, jumping from here to there, with nothing compelling to keep me adrift on a sea of historical mumbo-jumbo. I gave up after less than 100 pages. Sorry - it's obviously well-intentioned, but just not compelling or gripping reading - even for someone who is the core target audience!"
1,This movie was just terrible..,First off I went through several copies of this movie before I found one that was good and that alone let you know that there are bad presses out there...Secondly the story stinks because it doesn't seem nothing like the anime and thirdly don't even bother watching this crappy movie...
2,15dB Broadband Cable Amplifier,"I was disappointed in this product. When I attached it at the cable source it created probles for my broadband connection and living TV set. I did install it at my TV on the second floor where I was originally having signal deterioration and it worked for awhile. I would first suggest having your cable company in and ""tweak"" your cable throughput - it shouldn't cost you anything other than sitting around waiting for a service call. I no longer have it installed and will resell it on ebay."
1,Cable Amp,Forget this. The amplifier actually reduced the signal strenth of the incoming cable internet signal. Don't buy this.
5,DB takes Drum & Bass to a higher level,"This album is more of an overture than a mix of singles. From the beginning to end, the CD moves you musically and emotionally in perfect progression. This is intelligent Jungle at its best, a must-own for any Jungle-head."
2,Inferior product,"I have to say that the rubber bands I have used have been of a much lower quality than expected. Many of the rubber bands are extremely thin (not the correct size) and quite a few appear to be ""dry rotted"" as they break very easily.I am a paper carrier and use these to wrap around the paper. As it doesn't do me much good when the rubber band breaks, I don't really expect to purchase these rubber bands in the future. This is unfortunate as I will be purchasing them for several carriers at our distribution center."
2,To many sauces in the refridgerator,"Not the best book for home cooking, If you decide to make more than one dish at a time, you will have two or more basic sauces in the fridge, these sauce last one to four weeks. wHAT A MESS. I cooked several of the recipes and made them with sauce ingredients, they were just OK."
2,fails to please,"Ming's show is always one of our favorites. The book, however, just doesn't excite us as much as the show. The photos are nice, the information and individual descriptions are helpful. But, the book just doesn't exude the same spark as Ming's tv personna."
2,Ming Tsai is great but watch out for the editor!,"My husband and I love Ming Tsai's style of cooking. We were printing recipes off the Food TV site before this cookbook came out. So you can imagine our disappointment when we tried a few recipes out of this cookbook and found them riddled with typos, errors in ingredient amounts, and poor editing. The writer of the cookbook, Boehm (?), seems to have done slapdash work in the testing department: the translation of a restaurant-level preparation to that of the home cook is poor. We have had to do a great deal of juggling and rewrites to make the recipes come out right.Ming, please hire a new collaborator for your next cookbook! Your recipes are too good to be messed up by poor editing!"
5,Blue Ginger,I bought this book because I sampled some of the dishes at a friend's dinner party. The meal was so delicious that I had to purchase the book. Excellent! Not bad for a guy who started out as an engineer :)Charlotte Liu
4,"I'm no expert, but my husband digs it...","I got this for my hubby (He Who Cooks), since he'd specifically requested a Blue Ginger cookbook after we'd spent an hour drooling over a recent ""Simply Ming"" episode on TV (and Ming, the rat bugger, doesn't have anything west of the Alleghanies, apparently). I'd seen the more negative reviews here, especially regarding the editing, but after looking at it in a brick-n-mortar store (and then purchased here, since it was cheaper...yay, discounts!), it occurred to me that Ming's editor may be British-trained, which could account for some differences in style.Since I'm not a cook/chef/etc., I can't really judge it comparatively to others in its field (hence, only 4 stars), but my husband definitely liked the Fusion style greatly, even the recipes in the back calling for really expensive ingredients. I look forward to delicious mysteries issuing forth from our kitchen!"
3,We had fun with this!`,"This was alot of fun, but they were promised that there were more than one endings with it and there was not. Only one."
2,Not great!,We played this for New Year's Eve. It was fun until we got to the end and found out who the murderer was. There was no way of finding out ourselves. It was a convoluted ending. Very disappointing. This is our 3rd year doing this and only 1 of 3 games were we able to actually figure out the murderer ourselves.
2,Fun- but has problems,"This is my first murder mystery (as well as all of my guests first) and we had a lot of fun. We will definitely have another murder mystery but I don't plan on buying it from the same company. As others have wrote try not to have 8 people, as it complicates the game. Maybe our group wasn't paying enough attention, but people kept missing their opportunity to ask questions and their was no guide on who should ask who in an exact order. The storyline was very humorous, and as I've said we had fun, but if you are thinking about buying this product I may try to find another one if your group can get off topic."
3,What fun!!!,"This product was so much fun. THe party guests came dressed for their part,,r4ady to plkay. ALl the recipes were excellent and as fun to make and taste as the mysxtery. WIll buy more of these!"
3,Loved the game up until the ending,"I do not want to give anything away, but I was disappointed with the, ""who dunnit."" I thought ease of use and theme and characters were great. I had a 13 year old boy play a character and that is about as young as I would go. I would have highly recommended if not for the ending."
3,A decent overview of the SCA.,"This DVD recounts the events of a much earlier Pennsic (1991) event in the SCA. The technology used to produce the video shows its age, but the actual event's character does not appear to have changed much in the past 18 years.This video is a great introduction to the SCA in general, and I highly recommend it for that purpose. It can get long-winded at times - particularly in the extra footage after the credits - but is chock full of info about the Society and its doings.However, as a chronicle of that long-ago Pennsic, it is less than useful. There are some interesting battles caught on camera, as well as a couple events of import (such as a knighting ceremony), but for the most part the film's character is geared towards introducing newcomers to the SCA instead of documenting events."
3,Ammusing to the SCAdian,"I ordered this documentary as preliminary research. It was great fun to someone who has been in the SCA for a while though I wonder if I would have found it as interesting if I was new with no explanation. I guess I was expecting more of a documentary than a collection of home-video footage with some pretty decent interviews I will admit. Some of the information was very good. While I definitely like it and may show it to some people with some explanation I was hoping for some data, terms explained, and perhaps a more analytical approach to the SCA. Would I buy it again? Yes for my personal enjoyment at least."
4,Why we are how we are,Peter Drucker was a product of Austria.He was exposed to their writers on social political and economic issues.This gave him a different perspective to those who were exposed to English writers such as Keynes.As we are now in troubled times it is well worth rteading the book for a different perspective.
5,Outline of family history,"I am very new to genealogy, and I needed some help finding info on our distant fore-bearers. This is a compilation of exact copies of family trees- don't expect to be led by the hand. However- I do find it a great help."
3,Above average formula,"A starter book for readers and writers of lesbian fiction.Hard to really get close to the characters - I finished it mainly for my own sense of closure. Viable situation, but the book needed more character development. Seemed like a story sketched out pretty well but not worked fully. The antagonist was not ""large enough,"" and the steps taken to counter the antagonist were naive.I will probably read more Jackie Calhoun, but more from her reputation than this particular book."
4,I love this book,"Annie & Jack find out that there's a rattlesnake in a ghost town and they have to hide from some people. And they find a piano that's playing all by itself. And we don't know what ...was playing it. It's a surprise for you, because you might find out. And I might find out too, because I have it at home. I have a lot of Magic Tree House books at my house. ..."
5,My 4 year old loves these books!,"Magic Tree House books are so amazing. My 4 year old loves them, and I love how each one is so different, and seems to be so historically accurate. I especially love when she started adding ""Facts for you and Jack"", with more information about the time and the location they visited in the story."
5,Love the series!,my daughter loves all these books! we keep collecting them wonderful mix of history and fiction that makes kids want to read more. The product arrived in excellent condition and fast
3,Nanoparticles,"So this product contains nano particles of silica and protein. I believe there is a need to know that there are many materials out there that are made into nano particles and are used in cosmetics. Perhaps different materials has different effects to health, positive or negative. L'Oreal used the nanotechnology on their cosmetics. Revlon has nano particles in theirs, so has Estee Lauder's. Bandages has nano particles, so are sunscreens, socks, toothpastes, baby bottles, pillows, towels, and batteries. Research hasn't been conducted yet, so we can't be so sure that everything nano-sized will kill us."
1,Nanoparticles have not yet been found to be safe!,"NANOPARTICLES???? I was in the process of re-ordering this item until I read the description. Apparently you're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe. Thanks a lot, Lancome! Not on MY face!"
2,Hours and hours of pain...,"This book was designed to be used in conjunction with the intensive introductory hysics courses at MIT and Caltech. At these schools, the kit with all the parts for the lab is supplied by the instructor. Of course, if you are anyone except a student at MIT or Caltech, thi list is unavailable to you and the book will be quite confusing... not that it is any less confusing if you have the parts. While there is a lot to be learned in this small text, there has got to be a less painful way. This one book alone has caused more sleep loss among freshman than anything else I can think of."
1,Don't buy it or you will lament it!,"The book is practically useless and intellectually void. You are supposed to be in possesion of a kit of materials that is not described and there is no indication that it can be acquired anywhere. The only thing that results clear is the presumption and feeblemindedness of the authors and the greed of the publisher. The price is ludicrous for such a notebook. The preceding ""Editorial review"" is untruthful."
1,Not worth five dollars,The cycle is too light weight and has many part problems. I cannot believe that different sites want so much money for this product. Not worth the money. Sorry my opinionHave one and hate it.
4,Interesting Read,"This collection of short stories were interesting to read.Some were intriguing,others were okay, and some were suspenful.I enjoyed her writing about middle and upper middle class African Americans that are often neglected in popular literature. Some pieces were autobiographical but they span from the 1920s -1980s.Provides the reader with an intereting insight to an African AmericanNew Englander's perspectives but ultimately illustates that we are all part of the human community.This is good reading for a rainy day, a snowy day, or any day!"
2,depressing,I was born in the early 30 and life was hard but this book was so depressing that it never had a happy thought life was hard but we always had some happiness not all just down to bad she is so miserable that she never say any goodness of peoples.
3,A Modest Effort,"I have mixed feelings about Ms. West's novels. On the one hand, she writes remarkable well about the human condition and even her shortest stories translate into volumes in the mind. On the other hand Ms. West's constant references to skin color and class are contrived and nauseating. It make on e think that maybe she hated her own warm brown skin. These stories are interesting. Some are underdeveloped mostly because she was so very young when she penned them. It's a worthwhile book but it didn't make me a fan."
2,Not that great,"I am looking to take a trip to see Niagara Falls. This documentary certainly talks about the falls but I have seen other documentaries on cable that got into things to see and do in the area and this has little of that. Instead we have songs from local artists and history of the falls past. I couldn't have cared less about the songs and the history is a bit overdone. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not worth the price I paid."
2,"Smily Factory CD, Could not use","As a big smiley fan,and having been burned (bad virus) by down loading smileys, I thought this would solve my smiley fetish. Was not compatible with Windows 7 . . . ."
5,I love this song.,I remember hearing this (as most of us did) in the lost boys soundtrack.Its one of those tracks you skip back to hear again and agian and when this was released i wasnt sure what to expect.But its damn good and worth the small price to buy.
1,I'm horrified,If you're a fan of the original you probably won't like this upbeat dance mix. Wait for a sample to hear before you waste your hard earned cash.
1,Terrible product,This is not a compression short. There is no stretch at all to the fabric and it runs a bit small. I was completely disappointed.
4,a solid book,It's been a few years since I read this but I noticed it had no reviews. This book chronicles the movement of women from the sidelines to the headlines at the New York Times. It's a solid memoir.
2,Not a good collection of recipes...,"Mediocre cookbook; I lived in Paris and I can tell you that the recipes in Linda Dannenberg's French Tarts are not the best collection on the subject. I have been a fan of Linda Dannenberg's books ever since I took interest in collecting cookbooks five years ago and was very disappointed with her work on French Tarts. I think one would be better off to try to find a cookbook written by a French chef on this subject, because tarts to be perfect they need to be well balanced in taste and texture and must be very precisely prepared."
2,French tarts,"This book lacks variety,quantity and photos. Don't go out of your way to buy this book."
5,Awesome!,Love her stories!! Wish she were still publishing these books. I buy them for my friends with large families. They love them too!
1,A new breakthrough in this latin genre: Lullaby Salsa!,"Giro, with his fairy tale fantasy type of voice is definitely the sweetest music choice for all latin american children to go to bed. Even though the arrangements are good and the quality of the music is superb, Giro singing style sounds more like a Disney character than a true salsero. It's a nice change of pace if you're looking for that, but as far as being consider a true salsa sonero, singer or entertainer he's not any of those... I say, save your bucks for the real thing: Albita, Andy Montañez, DLG, Makina Loca, Tito Allen, Gilberto Santarosa..."
5,Contributes to Treatment of Eating Disorders,"I am a therapist at an outpatient clinic dealing with eatings disorders. We have used this book for treatment of eating disorders for over 2 years. Every client has experienced benefits through the insights, questions, and guidelines in this book. Even ""normies"" can benefit. Marsia and Andrea have a loving, intelligent approach that both challenges and inspires readers. Their honesty and openess give hope to those who wish to change old behaviors and expand interpersonal relationships. This book is a jewel to be examined over and over."
3,Narrow focus to overeating,"While I found interesting things in this book about why people over-eat. It really didn't apply to my circumstances. This book focuses on those who use eating as a coping mechanism for their overwhelming lives. If you have been abused, feel guilty about your weight, or you are struggling with anxiety you will probably find this book very helpful. Otherwise, I would give it a pass."
2,Influencias,I thought this CD was much more recent than 1995. It has his older ballad style and I prefer his more recent work.
5,Please! More Twins!,"If you are someone who likes serious in-depth anime with a rigid story line and characters of immense background battling it out in robotic morphing suits....then this is by far not the anime for you. But if you are the type of person that likes to kick back and watch something with a good storyline and cornball characters that you can either relate to, fall in love with, or just plain laugh at, then do yourself a favor and get every episode of Please Twins you can find. I am the type of anime fan that likes things such as Azumanga Daioh, Love Hina, Excel Saga, Happy Lesson etc etc and I have to say that after watching the first DVD I was eagerly awaiting the second, and now the third. Assuming that this was somehow connected with Please Teacher I went and purchased the entire series but have to say with all conviction that it is good, but the characters are not as easy to get immersed in as that of Please Twins."
3,Kinda Cheesy,"I give these a solid ""not bad"". A bit high priced for only two mats. I have a red 2006 Hyundai Tiburon and these mats kind of give a ""cheesy""/cheap look to the interior. Just a little over the top. I would rather see a more subtle look. Quality does not seem to be anything special either. I think they will hold up for quite a while, but I will probably only use during the winter to protect my good Hyundai mats from snow/salt. I would think you could find something else for under $30 that would come with a set of 4."
4,Thinner than I expected but looks nice. Not for winter usage!,"The mats look exactly as pictured. I bought it to use in the winter since my new car has carpet mats that just won't stand up the to winter of ice and salt.However, these probably are not the best for winter application just because the mats are pretty thin and there isn't an raised edge in which to capture any melted snow and ice from your shoes. (However, the description never said they were for winter so I can't say anything bad)."
4,Good material,"I'm giving 4 stars for the durable material, however they are very long and don't quite fit right. There's no left or right mat, they are universal so they look kind of awkward."
1,Recieved wrong item,I got thee other style of floor mat of this brand but cant find an email to contact you with. The one with red on and 1 solid black stipe down the middle
5,Fantastic,dude these floor mats are sick and fit perfectly in my 99 honda civic! they really bring out the color and interior part of the car! Stay fresh with these!
2,Great Idea!,"Very good idea, however, they have some kind of flour coating on them and are not sweet at all. It's a shame because they would come in handy when I need them for a recipe and don't have to chop up whole dates."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Usually I agree with other's reviews on products, but not these Date Crumbles. They are not good- I was expecting a sweet snack that as one reviewer wrote I could ""eat right out of the bag."" Maybe if I was super hungry. They just didn't do it for me. Now I have 4 bags to figure out what to do with. Sorry Bob's. Love all your other stuff!"
5,Great solution for labtop USB connectivity!,"This is a simple and efficient way to increase the USB connectivity for a laptop computer. We just purchased a new HP laptop with only 3 USB ports. Between webcam, printer, wireless mouse/keyboard, and external hard drive, there was not enough ports on this brand new computer. By using this 7 port hub we got all the connectivity we needed. What's more, since the hub is self-powered with an AC adapter, we're not drawing power from the laptop's motherboard. We've used this for a month and have had no problems whatever."
2,Nothing new,"Based on the documentary Mysteries of the gods, this program provides no new information on the theory of ancient astronauts and the knowledge they might have passed on to man to help construct some of the most famous structures from around the world. This documentary seems to have cut and paste footage from Mysteries of the Gods and been given a new voice over, too many theories but no answers. The dvd states 1999 on the back cover, thinking it was an updated version, its actually produced in the 70's. The transfer had many artifacts all over the image from start to end, really showing its age. The audio is Dolby 2.0. Extras, we get a preview trailer of other titles in this series that runs for 3 minutes. Running time 44 minutes. Transfer 1/5, Audio 3/5, Extras 1/5. Advise to purchase Mysteries of the Gods if it becomes available on dvd."
1,Do Not Support This Album!!!!,"I'm all about supporting the artist especially independent artists who pour every ounce of blood, sweat, and tears into the music they make. Having said that, I know for a fact that this album was released without Frank Mccomb's consent. Knowing that Frank Mccomb is not being compensated at all from the sale of this CD, I cannot support this CD and hope that you will follow suit.I urge you to go to frankmccomb.info to purchase Frank's music. You won't be sorry!"
2,Disappointment,"This album would probably sound ok to someone who had never heard the Stone Roses' debut. But if you're one of those who loved the first cd and want more, you're not gonna be crazy about this cd.Everything sounds overworked and too glossy, as the saying goes...""you cant polish a turd"".Spend your money on the Stone Roses' debut. It's a great, great cd. When it came out, I thought the band had HUGE potential to get even better. Alas, that potential went completely unfullfilled.Stone Roses R.I.P."
2,Where the plot was lost...,"Oh, the sorriness of it all...after Spike Island and the sheer visceral thrill of the debut album, this was what followed it all up. This album is way too self-indulgent and lacking in the charm department that endeared us to the Roses in the first place. No ""I Wanna Be Adored"", no ""Waterfall"", no ""She Bangs The Drums""...what we have here is a band that was on its way out; it's a shame that this album had to be, the Roses mythology would have been far better had this unnecessary album never been recorded. Though ""Ten Storey Love Song"" keeps the album from being entirely unlistenable."
2,over-rated comeback album,"Well well, was the wait worth it..I doubt it after listening to this second rate ensemble of second hand riffs and pitful lyrics.Whilst the eponomous (sic) debut album was a feast of great licks and cracking rhythm, the overdue 2nd lp will not be a epitaph most Roses fans would have liked.Sorry Jay !Still a great comeback by Mr Brown, now he's joined the mile high club.Dixie (Leeds)"
4,very understated,"This is a great album. There is no reason to compare the debut with this album, because they are very different. The Stone Roses could not record for some 4 years, and it is amazing how well they play here. I look at this album as a maturing phase in their career, and it is too bad they did not stay together. I would say there are 5 great songs on par with the debut: Ten Storey Love Song, Tears, How Do You Sleep?, and Your Star Will Shine., along with several other quality cuts of great guitar. A great album worth owning!!!"
5,#1 all-time favorite,"Simply put, I just love this cd. I like to listen to it from start to finish. It's a musical journey I save for ""special"" opportunities, like a long road trip in the car or hanging out with a few friends at a ski cabin."
4,Back to psychedelic era with amazing touch of John Squire,"When the first time I listened to this record,I think a very big progress happened to john squire and the music seems so colourfull and strange. This is the final result from The Stone Rosses music exploration."
5,I give it 10 stars or metaphysical surtitude,"A travesty that this album is not known to all. The Stone Roses could have changed the world. How do you sleep? is one of the most brilliant, soaring rock songs of all time. Tightrope is the greatest love poem of all time. Ten Storey Love Song is magic, and Love Spreads came from the lost soul of Robert Johnson. Second Coming is one of the few pieces of pop culture that is not rubbish. Even though John Squire seems to be a jerk, he is an incredible musician. Ian Brown is a man of destiny. While today's world does not remember them, history won't forget them. Long live the Stone Roses. One Love."
2,COMING UNDONE!,BREAKING INTO HEAVEN: 5 stars.DRIVING SOUTH: 2 stars.TEN STOREY LOVE SONG: 4 stars.DAYBREAK: 4 stars.YOUR STAR WILL SHINE: 1 star.STRAIGHT TO THE MAN: 1 star.BEGGING YOU: 2 stars.TIGHTROPE: 1 star.GOOD TIMES: 1 star (talk about an ironic title).TEARS: 2 stars.HOW DO YOU SLEEP: 1 star.LOVE SPREADS: 4 stars.Tally 'em up:28 stars12 songsYou're more or less looking at a 2 star album.
5,Guaranteed pleasure,"Because their first album (""Stone Roses"") was, and remains, a genuine masterpiece, ""Second Coming"" has received some unfairly harsh treatment as a ""disappointment"". Actually, this is a really fine album, with propulsive rhythms, great washes of glorious thundering guitar, and some terrific melodies. Most CDs at three times the price don't wear this well. OK, so it's not the classic that ""Stone Roses"" is. Sometimes just ""great"" is good enough. A guaranteed pleasure."
2,Will always suffer against the 1st coming,"To quote James ""if i hadn't seen such riches, I could live with being poor""thats problem for the Second Coming, the first record was a majestic moment in time, a time capsule of joy and ecstacy,This record is the day after, although a good record in its own right, its not great.Heavy, laboured and leaden it's more like a come down than the second coming.I would suggest skipping this and moving straight on to Ian Browns solo work."
2,Not worth the time or expense.,"Most of the information in this book is nothing new. The author doesn't, in my opinion, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, any of the points he is trying to make.Do a little research on the internet and save yourself some money."
4,Great industrial electronic/ alt rock blend,"In my area we have recently suffered the demise of the FM radio dial's only true alternative station, which played NIN, Offspring, Chili Peppers by day, and then late at night on the weekend would play more exotic electronic dance.It's as if the spirit of that dead station has been synthesized and bolted onto this CD by Boris BadEnuff. Listen to Bad Habit, it's very indicative of the driving industrial nucleus of this disc, a baker's dozen of tight tracks featuring hard hitting beats, crunching guitar, a range of compelling vocal styles, howling synths and thick, phat bass.Fearless Leader is demanding you: grab Natasha and get dancing."
5,Fantastic Performance,"Fantastic Tracks from a well crafted performer.I first heard some of Boris's creations on GarageBand.com, and it really peeked my interest. Great tension in his work, much like the Chemical Brothers, but more exciting. I find myself constantly popping the disk in the CD player in the car, and it's always in the iPod rotation.The music is engaging and well performed. Each track truly takes your mind and body to another place. This is an artist that I expect to find in all the clubs, and in every ear for some time to come.Don't miss this experience.Ian TateConnor Man Music"
2,Disappointed,This product lights reluctantly with a match - sometimes it takes two or more matches to get it started and it extinguishes easily. It works but using it to kindle a fire in a wood stove is a hassle.Wax/sawdust fire starters I've used in the past lit and stayed lit more easily.I do not recommend this product.
2,Bad Condition,"I ordered this book and it stated it was in really good condition, it was going to be a gift. The pages are really yellow and the binding is broken. Really not what I would call ""Good"" condition. Fair to poor would be more like it"
5,"Finally, a statistics manual (and great CD) that makes sense","I've been dreading my required statistics exam. I bought this manual out of total desperation and realized that my professor has only been confusing me. Now, after reading the manual, I actually GET THIS STUFF! The CD is cool 'cause it sort of etches everything into your memory for good. Now I don't have to spend half-an-hour after each class trying to get my professor to explain everything to me. I might even register for statistics II (different prof.)"
5,The Late and Great Eddie Gurrero,"Being born into a wrestling family Eddie Gurrero had the passion, determination, and thrives to become one of the best in the business. Cheating Death Stealing Life is a moving story of a man's life that shows that theirs more to live than only thinking of your self, this book will touch the hearts of all who read this book.In his own words Eddie Gurrero takes you through his life from being a child watching his family wrestle to having his family watch him wrestle at Wrestle Mania. In detail he goes through his life in great detail from his family problems, his drug addictions, and his near death experiences. He takes you through his wrestling carrier, from wrestling in Mexico, Japan, and the US. I would recommend this book to anyone wrestling fan or not."
2,"Sorry, Elizabeth","I am an avid fan of Elizabeth Gage's first popular books: Pandora's Box, A Glimpse of Stocking, and The Master Stroke. I also was captivated by her novel Intimate. However, Taboo was just so-so. This novel, Confession, was a huge disappointment. The first two thirds of the novel dragged by and was hard for me to read!! I assure you that if you read any of the first three titles I mentioned, you will not be able to put them down! This, on the other hand, started to make me yawn! The last third of the novel picked up and was much more readable than the first two thirds! If you want my advice, read Ms. Gage's other books first, but skip this one! Confession is not a good representation of Elizabeth Gage's talent as a writer. Also, judging by the reviews, avoid her other novel, Against All Odds! Go for her early works!"
4,easily understood,I bought this for my husband to go with his new ukulele. He says this book was very helpful. It was small enough to be able to find chords quickly and was well organized. He says the only thing it was missing was scales.
1,not pleased,the DVD is quite boring and very boring. This DVD can be misleading for the Ancient prophecies tapings from the mid 90's.
4,Very interesting,"This is another strong Ridgeway book. Although he doesn't have the wide range of material to draw from as in the Shadow of Kilimanjaro, this book is still fascinating. Anyone who reads this will be intrigued by the fate of the chiru, appalled that so many people could be convinced that their fur could be collected off bushes and rocks (including major magazine publications), and interested in the dynamics of four determined personalities working together to cross the Chang Tang. Highly recommended."
3,"Interesting read, hoped for more photos.","I'd give the text a 4, but my real motivation for the book was because of Galen Rowell's involvement. Unfortunately there's only several photos in the book and seemed like his name was tacked on the cover merely to sell the book. Obviously he had passed by the time the book was written and was a major character in the story but I think if it was illustrated in the manner like Barbara Rowell's Flying South book then the book would have been a 4-5 star book. The photos were a bit lackluster as well, I'm sure with better editing this book could have been something special. I know Rowell probably had better photos from the trip than was presented here.The idea behind the book was great as the motivation was to create a reserve to protect the Tibetan Chiru from hunters. I'd recommend the book."
4,Great account...,"The book is a terrific account of a very challenging trek across Tibet's Chang Tang, in search of the elusive Chiru's calving grounds. Ridgeway's writing is outstanding in the manner in which he gets the reader to feel an integral part of the expedition, and to experience the risks and the challenges involved in such an impossible trek.In terms of raising awareness about the chiru's unfortunate plight, this book, and the story on NG are hugely effective (I have not seen the TV documentary on the same, so I cannot comment on that.Photography - one of the main reasons I bought the book is because the photography is by the legendary Galen Rowell, who was part of the trek. Galen's photography in the book is good, but well below his high standards in his own books. Surprisingly, I didn't see a single photograph that really made me go ""WOW!"" like a lot of Galen's photographs.All in all, an excellent book that is difficult to put down."
4,Access at a Glance,Book received in great shape and as promised. This book was a lot of help in my job at the time. It was just what I needed and expected.
4,Non-Violent Politically-Correct War Card Game,"This game is fun, but not something you'd want to play for a long time. The cards are durable, but the box tore in the first day we got it. The pictures on the cards are neat. The directions easy to follow. Good game, but again, not something you want to play over and over."
2,"Neat book, NOT a restoration guide.","I read and re-read this book while restoring my jeep and thankfully I found other resources that made me realize how much of the data in this book is off. The period pictures are great, but only one or two of the restored jeeps featured in this book are done with much attention to detail."
4,Nice durable well made puzzle,"This is a beautifully illustrated puzzle, strong durable pieces. The ""reflection"" of the animal figures in the water make the puzzle a bit more difficult(for those who lose patience)probably not a good choice for small kids I think 12 and over."
2,Not enough detail,"This was a very superficial, poorly produced item...sorry I spent my money on it. There needed to be more guidance as to preferable settings. Video information was minimal and not especially useful."
5,camo hat suit,this camo kit is cool nobody can see me with this on you should buy it if u hunt or for hiding needs such as airsoft or pant ball
3,Show Way and Soonie's story,"Soonie's family made Show Way quilts, ones that would show illiterate slaves the way to freedom. In this Newberry Honor book, Jacqueline Woodson takes children on a trip into the past back to the days of her great-granmother Soonie and beyond into the days of slavery. Readers will read about slavery, the days after the slaves were freed, the fight for equal rights during the sixties to present day to when the author's daughter was born. As a white person, I struggled a bit with the language used in places, but enjoyed the story that told of generations of black women and their strength and courage and love for their families."
4,Excellent DVD-R disks for the best price at Amazon only,"I got this pack last month and by now I have written 15 dvd disks using Sony DRX 510UL. All the disks worked flawless in my Toshiba sd2900 dvd player. My advise, take this opportunity Amazon has given and buy these. Its worth the money."
2,50% Failure Rate with Panasonic DVD Recorder,I recently purchased a Panasonic DVD Video Recorder (model DMR-E80H). I purchased these disks at the same time. I have used about 20 of the disks and thus far have had a 50% failure rate.
1,"More success so far 4 me with ""+"" R's","More success so far 4 me with ""+"" R's. I don't buy ""-"" R's anymore like this. Sony DVD recorder player works, playstation and computer dvd players/burners liking ""+"" R's more :o) for me."
5,The Best DVD-R on the market!,"These are the best dvd-r's on the market. I have only had a handful of these not work, out of the hundreds that I have used. Very stable and plays on most dvd players. Highly recomend! Can't beat the price!"
1,Burned about 3 disks and the rest are underruns,"Well, I usually do not have a problem with Memorex in recordable media...However, I purchased this spindle of 25 thinking 26 bucks for 25 blank dvd discs was an awsome deal, but it turned out to be a disaster. I burned maybe 3 discs fine, then all of a sudden every single data dvd I try to burn now using my Sony exterior DVD R/RW burner gives me an Underrun. Now I have wasted about 8 discs. I'd say you get what you pay for...My 10 PACK of Fujifilm DVD-Rs cost me the same price as this 25 pack, and you wonder why...I think fujifilm is a better disc and has less chances for an underrun. Built better I suppose. I'll stick to the small packs of expensive discs from now on...never had a problem with those!"
2,Check compatibility with writer BEFORE buying media!,One out of every 4 discs would fail on me when I'd burn to this media at 4x. Slowing down the burn to 2x didn't help either! I own a Sony DRU500A with the latest firmware. Memorex isn't on their compatibility list. Lesson learned: check the compatibility list BEFORE buying!
1,Terrible Quality,I just purchased a Panasonic DMR-E60S and these DVD-R. Over half of these could not be written by the DVD recorder. I thought it might be the unit. I purchased TDK DVD-R disc and haven't had a failure yet. I would avoid the Memorex discs.
2,Not for Panasonic DMR-E80H,"As with other Panasonic DMR-E80H users, I was able to successfully burn only about 50% of my 25 pack. The other half failed."
1,Power Calibration Error,NEC ND 1100-A Use to work but no longer does. Nero 6.5. Nero reports a Power Calibration Error after about 45 seconds and then fails a 4X speeds.
1,Incompatible with my burner,"This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware."
1,My NEC1300A died trying to burn one of these,"It could be coincidence. My NEC 1300A had burned seven Ritek dvd-r discs, and five Ritek dvd-rw discs, but in the middle of the first burn on one of these, the burn failed, the message appeared that ""Drive not ready"" and the drive never worked again. In case you have color preferences, these discs are red.The package comes with a large disclaimer that it can break a Pioneer burner without a firmware update. I had firmware 1.7 on the NEC.It really could be coincidence, but be forewarned.UPDATE: I got a replacement NEC 1300A, flashed it to firmware 1.9 upon arrival, and have since burned these Memorex's successfully. Still, I'd just assume buy more reliable Ritek's for less money."
1,Optical Block problems,"Do not buy this, do a google search on sony lcd rear projection televisions and you will find class action lawsuits about a optical block defect that shows up about 2 years of use. Sony has the worst customer support i have ever dealt with in my entire life. There are thousands of people stuck with these dust collectors that cost more to fix than they are worth."
5,Good picture works great,"We got this for about 4 years now and the TV is pretty good. Using with Blu-Ray and DVD most of the time, the picture is one of the better ones. It has enough inputs and even our PC works fine on this screen. No issues whatsoever. Great TV!"
1,The worst TV,"I still own a old Emerson 19inch that out lived the Sony! The Emerson cost $100 in it's day and the Sony $2,500. The optical block is going out and we have replaced 2 lamps! I just found out recently that this is a major issue with this TV and from what I have researched Sony will do nothing to help! We also had a Sony Home Theater System die! Sony used to be the best quality! Not anymore!"
2,Poor HD,"Let me start by saying that I love this movie - I am not rating the movie itself poorly. Trying to watch the Blu Ray 'Screwhead Edition' gives me a headache, though. Didn't anyone watch this oversharpened mess before they published it? It's as if they turned the contrast all of the way up, and called it good. Chainmail alternately disappears, and blinds as every link become a brilliant shining white - Same with BC's hair, sometimes it's dark, other times it looks white. Occasionally the picture gets so grainy that if you didn't know better, you'd think that it was a stylized flashback scene. I'm sorry I put out the extra money to buy this version - my regular old school dvd (and honestly, even my vhs version) look better than this. It's a trick, get an axe!"
3,Good point of view,Interesting book but mostly based on the author's points of view on acting and not well adapted as a source of information for new actors
2,what planet r they from,"This thing sold new for around 20.00.I dont know how they came up with the price of 119.00 but thats bizzare.That is a smuch as a full size real Robosapien V2!Run, dont walk, away!"
5,Good Toy!,This is a Great toy.However it looks very UGLY!!Other than that it is a good toy and you should get it.I Hope this review made your decision to either get this toy or not.
3,Good for deep in the woods!,This larger size backpack is better for deep woods sites. The bolts on the handle keep falling off though.
2,Below average slow moving story,"This story moves along incredibly slow to the point of becoming boring. This was a book I couldn't wait to finish and put in the worst ST books pile. I enjoy unusual character developments, if it is done nicely. Here it wasn't. Spock completely disses Kirk in all respects to force the alien influence from him. No second-guessing or regrets from Spock. This not Spock! It ruins the rest of the story.Not a good read..."
1,Avoid this book,"This is #5 in the classic Star Trek tie-in series and one of the weakest of the lot. It demonstrates all the worst aspects of tie-in novels.The basic premise is that Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise are 'alien abductees', being taken by unknown powerful aliens to be used as unwilling experimental subjects. As a result of this Kirk is deemed unfit for command and Spock is named captain in his stead. The idea is not bad in itself and was used to much better effect elsewhere (The Next Generation).The problems here are in the protrayals of the main characters, Spock and Kirk would never behave as these authors have them doing. Also the action, such as it is, drags along, interrupted by long, pointless, impassioned speeches, lots of drivel about 'Vulcan Command Mode' and many trips down memory lane recalling previous events - which are fully footnoted.There are many novels in this series and just about any one of the others would be a better choice than this one."
3,Mediocre execution of a potentially great story idea¿,"Seemingly omnipotent aliens are conducting dreadful experiments and hastening the demise of the galaxy in an effort to solve the age old &#65533;Promethean&#65533; question of good v/s evil. This story has its moments but in the end it tends to confuse more than enlighten or even entertain. The character of the Vulcan Admiral Savaj has tremendous potential and the insights into Vulcan culture are interesting however the interplay between Kirk and Spock is rather bizarre even taking into consideration the role reversal that they undergo. I also find it hard to believe that Vulcans would ever actually behave as prejudiced, arrogant and condescending as they are portrayed here. It just isn&#65533;t logical."
5,GREAT STUFF!,"I've been successful in sales over 25 years,taken every sales training seminar you can name.This book is the only one that has ever toldit like it is in the real world of selling.You master your craft, become successful, thenBOOM, somebody's out to bring you down:a beancounter, a sales manager, a disappointed rep.How do you stay on top? I wish I'd had this booktwenty years ago. If I had a sales force of fiftypeople I'd get it for every one of them."
4,Different take on sales....,Not the usual sales book stuff.... not a how to book.A really entertaining read - full of real advice.
2,Hired Gun?,"How would you feel as a customer if you knew that someone called a ""hired gun"" was going to call on you?This book is for the ""Tin Men"" and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" type of salesperson."
1,Nice stories but who is this book for?!,I was excited to get this book. I am currently number one in my department. I kept on waiting for something useful but all I got were stories. They were entertaining but that is not what I was looking for.
4,Well-Designed,"I like it: nice selection of accessory buttons (internet, sound etc) without being too busy. Keys have a nice feel. Big plus: Well-Lighted CAPS LOCK green LED: a big plus for lousy typists like me. All-in-all I really like it. (I dont use the mouse, so cant comment on it)."
4,Pocket gem scale,"I ended up ordering two of the scales because one did not come with the calibration weight. The first scale was not ordered through Amazon as I remember. It's been awhile. The second scale did come with a weight and calibrated perfectly but using the weight from the second ordered scale, the first would not calibrate, and still sits gathering dust. For the price of shiping and the physical hassle of returning it I haven't bothered with it. My fault not the fault of the manufacture. I'm just lazy. The second scale lived up to all my expectations and is used all the time and is very accurate on all the modes. The manufacture has scales that weigh larger items such as gem rough that weigh more than the 350 grams capacity and I won't hesitate to order that model from Amazon or from the same manufacture when I purchase. I've dropped it in the field many times and so far it has taken the beating and kept on ticking. A good buy at the price and is a good value."
2,Waste of my time.,"This book is no better than the first. And the first was bad. The only novel thing about the book is the idea, and having a magician solve problems is not a new concept, despite what others are saying.I have no idea how people can rate the writing is this book as five stars. How would they rate a true five star book? I don't get it. His dialog reads like a 12 year old wrote it. It's trash. I should never have listened to the person that said the second book is better than the first, so I should give it a try.I rated the first book 3 stars, being generous because I liked the idea, and was told the series gets better. Well, I'm done with that generosity. The first book I had to skip pages to get through. I couldn't even bother with finishing this one. Complete waste of time. If the concept had been used by someone that could actually write decent dialog, I may have enjoyed the book."
4,Better than the first,"Fool Moon is the second book in the Harry Dresden series. I thought this book was a step in the right direction. It was full of action and moved at a good pace. We get to see Harry do some very cool magic in this story. The only thing that gets on my nerves about the story is how quickly that Murphy, the cop Dresden works with, is to distrust Harry. It is ridiculous that she keeps wanting to throw him in jail. I would definitely recommend this series if you are a fan of paranormal fiction with some mystery thrown in."
3,Another ok installment,"3 stars.This is difficult for me to rate.On the one hand I liked the story a little more than the previous book. On the other hand though it took me a few tries to actually finish this one. I was a little bored through it. Which was so frustrating because I love werewolves and werewolf stories, if I was going to absolutely love any of the Dresden Files books it should have been this one.However I'm still willing to give this series 1 or 2 more books to grab me but right now this series is on the bubble for me."
3,"While entertaining, I have some problems with this one","Murphy is an idiot. She may be tough, but she's no detective and certainly no friend. A real detective, without brain damage, would know better than to keep assuming that Harry is the killer. And a friend would also know better. She's always worried about her job? I want to fire her!Then there's the deal in both books where Harry can't tell about the White Council, yet he tells her that the White Council were part of the .motivation for something, as if she'd always known what they were and Murphy doesn't give him so much as a ""what's the White Council."" Sloppy.The idiocy of Murphy aside. Harry Dresden is still a great, multilayer character and the book was a fun read.It's a shame that the publisher overcharged so for the ebook. If they didn't, I'd be buying book 3 right now, instead of waiting a month. They're probably losing money with their greed."
5,Phenomenal!,"I first became interested in the Dresden Files books by getting hooked on the Dresden Files SciFi channel show. There are, of course, many differences between the show and the books, but both are very high excitement, high action, and heavy with the adrenaline-pumping adventure. This particular book starts quick with the action, and never stops until the last page, as Harry gets in over his head with loup-garous, wanna-be werewolves, and his always-rocky relationship with Lt. Murphy. The twists and turns with the introduction of the FBI agents are a little bit obvious, but everything else in the book rocks - and has made me a continued fan of everything Dresden. I'll be getting more of these books after the season finale of the show next week (sniff.). Pick this up if you are a fan of anything scifi/fantasy!"
5,Great followup to 'Storm Front',"After reading the first 'Dresden Files' book, I eagerly dove into 'Fool Moon.' I was delighted to find it an even more engrossing read than 'Storm Front.' New friends, new enemies, and a mystery that seems to grow deeper with each clue uncovered until the final, climactic confrontation. If you decide to read this book, make sure you have a few free hours ahead, because you won't want to put it down!"
4,Second novel worth a first look,"Butcher expands his protagonist's vampire/wizard-filled world by introducing werewolves. It's a fun read, with an especially harrowing setpiece at the police station, and a good follow-up to his first book. Have fun with it, and look forward to book three, where in my opinion Butcher really hits his stride."
4,re: A Harry Situation,"The Dresden Files are shaping up to be one of my favorite series of books. Harry is a winner of a character and his supporting cast are all winners. I'm usually not a fan of mobster subplots but they don't seem to bug me here. In this book, Harry has werewolf troubles and we soon find out there are different types of the beasties. All the different types come crashing out of the woodwork around Harry and he must battle his way out of some hairy situations. The supernatural/detective/fantasy angle of the stories is really well done. I've started ""Grave Peril"" and love it so far. The books seem to get darker and better as Butcher goes along. Harry Potter made me enjoy fantasy fiction more than I have in a long while and Harry Dresden is kicking my obsession into overdrive. I will read anything Butcher writes."
2,Hrmmm...,"As a werewolf fan, I had to give the Harry Dresden series one more chance and picked up the second book. Not as hard to push through as book one, but in the end I was not satisfied with the read.I'll give it two stars for the interesting take on werewolf types, but that's about it. The content had me grinding my teeth as FBI agents and Police acted so outrageously unrealistic the suspension of disbelief couldn't hold.Spoiler --In one part, the plucky female police detective has hostile words with a female FBI agent, and the FBI agent draws a gun on the police detective, at a busy crime scene no less. Ooookay.... right. Then, the plucky, but stubborn police detective only reaction to the whole event is act tough and tell our hero Harry that she can take care of herself. This scene alone killed the story for me.I enjoyed minute parts scattered through the book, but it's like picking the chocolate sprinkles out of an otherwised soured dessert."
3,Slipping on the second one,"I was impressed with #1 in this series. Unfortunately, Butcher decides his series won't hold his readers unless he makes the protaganist into a pivotal character in world-wide affairs instead of 'just' a wizard/PI. #2 shows the signs of the change and #3 has it in full view, with Dresden being the spark for a major situation.I wish fantasy writers would provide strong characters without having to resort to turning them into Luke Skywalker or Frodod."
1,A stupid book,"This has to one of the worst books I ever tried to read. Its not the strange mix of magic with inconsistent rules that bothers me. I could suspend my disbelief for that. It's the fact that Harry Dresden is an idiot. I know that can be said for other fictional detectives, but Dresden goes way beyond the rest. He gets his friends killed, he makes enemies of every powerful person of group that he can find, and constantly walks into situations that he admits he knows enough to avoid. It doesn't help that most of his enemies, and supposed friends, don't grasp how dumb he is, and mistake his stupidity for malice. If you need to find out how bad this book really is barrow a copy. Don't waste your money by buying one."
1,Crap. Garbage. Waste of time.,"There was so many stupid parts. For one, there's too many different types of werewolves including one that transforms with a aid of a magic fur belt. Just place your hand down your pants, touch it and tada! OoOoh how about a wolf that becomes a person? or a person that becomes a wolf? and for the traditional werewolf lets throw a full moon in the sky five nights in a row. Also Harry meets himself in a dream who sorts out everything and scowls himself for not getting laid enough.I really enjoyed Storm Front but this just sucked!"
4,"How many ways can you spell ""werewolf""?","According to Harry Dresden's entrapped fairy-spirit, known as ""Bob"", there are at least four kinds of werewolves, and in this book Harry encounters all of them. This is the most nitty-gritty of the series, full of blood, gore and gutts - but then, it is about werewolves, I suppose, isn't it? I particularly liked the man-wolf of the story, a wolf who shapeshifts into a human instead of the other way around. The chief werewolf, the hapless loup-garou who, like Larry Talbot, is grieved over the curse laid upon him, and the pack of loyal lycanthropes calling themselves the Alphas, who become Harry's friends who are destined to assist him in later adventures. A fast-moving, literally bone-crunching adventure."
3,Good sequel,"I felt this book was hard to get into. Maybe there was just too much that I didn't know as a reader but I didn't feel myself eager to turn pages until around 163 when the action really started. And I really don't think I should need more than even five pages to get me hooked on a story.I liked the variety and complications of the whole werewolf legend. Jim Butcher took a trite supernatural being and added a good punch of originality to it. What I really enjoy about this series is the detail of what it's like being a wizard. From the soul-gazing experience, to having a possessed skull as a spell book, and explanation to potion making definitely make it believable because Harry relays this so matter-of-factly.This book shows cements the fact that there is an enemy Harry has yet to face yet and I hope we get to meet a new adversary in the next book. Plus, I really want to see Harry and Murphy together."
5,"Great read, even the second time.","As I reread the series, there are nuances of future plot developments it is nice to find. Great second book in series. The world of Dresden expands"
3,Lukewarm review,"I saw one of the books in this series reviewed, and thought the series might be a good read. True enough for the first couple books, but there's an obvious formula to them and after the third book in the series (very predictable outcome), it became obvious that this was just another boring series of page turners."
3,Liked it but...,"I decided to read this book after enjoying the tv series. And at first I really enjoyed it. It was like visiting an old friend I had really missed. But then, it go unrealistic. And yeah, I know, its about a wizard fighting werewolves of various sorts. But seriously, it was like he had no sleep for 3 days, lost all his magic powers, had been shot in the chest, had his foot nearly torn off and somehow, after three days of nonstop action with only the occasional cat nap in the trunk of someone's car, he was able to do things like climb a rope out of a pit. It was just too much and I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore. That being said, I did enjoy the book. Just wish it was a little more realistic."
4,good solid thriller,A solid creative thriller. I do wonder though why this wizard even bothers with a staff or rod because it seems as though that their main purpose is to go clattering out of his hands.
4,A Howling Good Time!,"FOOL MOON is an ideal sequel. It's better-written and faster-moving than its predecessor (STORM FRONT), with a more interesting plot and more chances for the supporting cast to shine. It's also a rarity in today's world: an unabashed, well-done creature-feature. B+/A-See full review [...]"
3,Entertaining,"Not as good as the first book in the series, but not bad enough to stop me in the series. Story was a little predictable and the love story seems a little out of place but still met expectation of Jim Butcher writing. I would definitely recommend this series. It's fast paced, graphic but still a quick read that keeps you engaged."
3,"story 7, narrator 4","Somebody needs to tell James Marsters how to pronounce ""chitinous"" and ""impotent."" There were several other slip-ups as well (a ""through the woods"" that obviously should have been ""through the words"") For the most part it was a good performance, but the errors definitely detracted from the listening experience."
4,Dresden and the wolves,"Harry Dresden returns in the second installment, a little more wizard and a little less detective than in Storm Front. This is an easy read with perhaps a slightly faster pace than the first, probably because the plot is a little more focused.The key characters are still the same, though there is no real progression of the story or characters. The book can stand alone. I intend to move on to the third book, still hoping for a little more character development along the way. It still strikes me as odd that Dresden is self-proclaimed as one of the top wizards in the world, yet is constantly overmatched by his foes, and the yet-to-be-seen dark forces lurking in the background."
4,Great Book,"I am really enjoying this series of books by Jim Butcher. He writes in such a way that you feel that you can relate to Harry. Harry is an ordinary guy, he just happens to be a wizard as well. Well written book, good humor, a little racy just for fun, and the fantasy side is well represented. Whether you like detective novels or fantasy, The Dresden Files series of books will keep you entertained. Give them a go!"
4,Decent plot,"Sadly, however, Harry is no Anita Blake. And equally sadly, his world does not seem to hold the trace of hope for a normal life that Anita's does... but the story itself is quite good, with interesting characters."
2,Not so hot,"This book really could have used some editing. It seemed like there were good ideas behind it, but they weren't well executed. Some of the mechanisms the author used to move the story along made me roll my eyes and put the book down for a while (the worst would be the chapter of talking to the subconscious in a dream because he can't seem to figure things out any other way). I want to like these books, but they have so many problems that they make me cringe. He gets the second star only because I find the ideas interesting."
4,Harry Potter for Grown ups LOL,I only started readign this series because I learned that the Sci-Fi series started out as books. I really loved the show and the books are jsut that much better. I have already moved on to the rest of the series and have enjoyed each one. I never know what Harry will do next and its a constant surpise. I hate books that you can predict and these are far from that. I look forward to reading more. I also hope the TV show continues.
3,"Decent, not great","For a fun romp its enjoyable.. Dresden as a character as defined by the author spends way too much time in the ""woe is me mode"" to be a creditable or realistic character. It is distractive and childish. Otherwise creative and worth a read."
4,Another fine adventure with the unsinkable Harry Dresden.,"Harry's insistence on being on the side of good, while refusing to label himself as “good"", is a wonderful example of a great hero's self perception. Harry is easy to cheer for, fun to laugh with, and a great friend to have along for travel or lonely weekends.Fool Moon isn't the very best of the Dresden Files, but it is still very good. It also gives much character development and back story for later novels."
4,Engrossing!,"Loving the Dresden files books, written beautifully I find myself so lost in the story I almost miss my bus stop! Highly recommend!"
5,Give me more,"I love Dresden. What a normal down to earth hero (except for the whole wizard thing). Jim Butcher makes it all seem so real. Another great book, can't wait to get my hands on the next one"
3,Nothing New,"From Nyx @ [...]I gave the first book 4, because it was the first one, so I was giving it the benefit of the doubt. Nothing much changed here. Harry is still slow on the uptake and doesn't make any connections till it's staring at him in the face. Murphy is still being an idiot and getting in the way (Read: Still don't like her).At the moment I'm debating whether to keep going with this series. Only reason why I'm thinking about it is because of the little tidbits of information we got regarding Harry's parentage. It will get interesting I'm sure eventually. I just don't think I'll get there."
3,Good quality read,"A good book, easy to read and quite entertaining. Not exactly earth shattering, but very enjoyable and a solid sequel."
3,Butcher gets better,"The second book in the series of the Dresdin files series as far as I am concerned is a easier read than the first one. It still contains a little to much going over some things from the first book, but it did keep my attention more then the first and it had some good action sequences that was well described with out to much descriptions into areas not needed which I feel this author seems to do a lot of. I have found that both books, one and two of this series really takes off after the first half of the book. It is at the last part that you then want to read on.This one made me want to start book three after I had finished it."
3,A Not Bad Read,"A decent spend of time. Not the best, but not the worst either. Action packed. The Dresden character is something that I will continue to follow."
3,An amazing novel,"This is the second novel in the Dresden Files, but it is still complete within itself. In my opinion, a good author makes each individual book its own novel, yet builds on previous novels in the series. In this novel, Dresden faces off against werewolves. Before the full moon, people begin getting mauled. At this same time, a man who inherited a werewolf curse from his family finds his protective charms broken. Is this man responsible for the killings, or is he being set up? When he is captured, an exciting scene in the jail ensues.I liked the first more than the second, but this was still a good story, and it is still a good read. I used to be irritated by James Butcher's writing style and format, but I am adapting to it. I am beginning to find the novels exciting and interesting. Overall, a good book, it can be read without reading the first. Additionally, subplots are beginning to reveal themselves. If you enjoyed the first novel, the second will keep you entertained."
3,"Good Story, Moderate Execution","I like the story, but the writing is a little weak. Unfortunately, the TV show was far better, which rarely happens. I have trouble with the relationship between Dresden and Murphy. Unlike the TV show, here they act like mortal enemies, yet they are actually friends. Very unbelievable. Still, a fun beach read..."
5,The Heiress,Great movie - been wanting it for a while - got this for myself - nice. Have not watched it all but will do very shortly. Love it .
4,"As a ten year old, I thought, ""Squeeeee, I can't believe how perfect this story is!!!""","Even after just one viewing, I remembered most of this movie. Casting Montgomery Clift certainly helped to burn this movie into my brain but the story was a perfect introduction into the world of ulterior motives, followed shortly by my initiation to the works of Agatha Christie. When I was 10, the strongest message I got was that people who don't want to work will marry other people for their money. I didn't even notice the damage done by the father or the disloyalty of the aunt. Thirty years later, the thing I noticed most was that neither of the lovers can NOT live without being with the other. There's no real love lost nor destroyed only ego. This is such a great movie and I don't feel ill-served for having seen it at the possibly too young age of 10. I don't need to rewatch this movie for it to be buzzing behind my brain all these years. It's a classic but even more rare, it's perfect storytelling."
5,My all-time favourite film,"THE HEIRESS is now my all-time favourite film, surpassing THE GHOST AND MRS MUIR, which was the top of my list for many years. For me, everything about this film is perfection: the acting, the superb screenplay, the wonderful score, the direction, the attention to detail... THE HEIRESS gets better and better with each viewing. But the best aspect of this film is Olivia deHavilland's portrayal of the tragic, pitiful Catherine Sloper who, denied a life of being loved by her resentful father, falls in love with the first man who shows her kindness. A classic and a must for any serious film lover's collection."
5,good movie,"i watched this movie yrs. ago & i always loved it. i can see why ms. de'havilland got the oscar for the part that she played. i felt so sorry for her character.a father who was so cold & never gave her credit for anything she did. why wouldn't she turn to the 1st man who would give her praise? (spoiled alert)!!!!!! i liked the part where her aunt said be very careful austin this man could take good care of katherine & her money. so if you feel the need to watch an old classic, please try the heiress."
5,BEST Olivia DeHaviland movie EVER!!!!,"Next to her and her offscreen best friend, Miss Bette Davis.Trivia: In ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte, Joan Crawford was to play Olivia's role. In true Bette Davis fashion, Davis talked to some ""friends"", producers, etc., and called Olivia to audition.Together, they literally STOLE Joan's role away from her!!!! HA!!!Revenge is better than Christmas!!! LMAO!!!So, Olivia and Bette did ""Charlotte"", and an awesome job it was.But I digress. In the Heiress, Olivia and Monty Clift, (gay in real life, just like Rock Hudson, and the others), but still, gorgeous as all hell in this, as all his others...Both were EXCELLENT in this.She is the typical wallflower, Clift is the swindler, who wants her fortune, now that she is the Heiress to her family estate, and so he sets out to swindle her, by pretending to fall in love with her.Well, finally at the end, she is onto him. And BOY, what an ending!!!Another must see!!!"
5,Henry James with improvements,"It is very rare that a novel-based movie improves upon the book, but ""The Heiress"" is certainly a rare example. Based on Henry James' novel ""Washington Square"", this movie provides what James' book sorely lacked. I will not ruin any endings for you, but I will say that much of the personality and resolve that was lacking in the book were finally given a voice in the movie. A wonderful movie and worth every minute."
5,Great service.,Good seller and great service. Movie was in tip-top condition. I got exactly what I paid for and appreciate that.
4,Hummm...,It was a pretty interesting movie.Linda Hamilton was awesome!!!! Nothing unusual there!!! LOL..IF you are a Linda fan like me... you will want to get this movie.
3,"Essentially the same as ""the food of vietnam""","If you like periplus cookbooks and already own ""the food of"" version of this book, then reconsider buying this one. The new ""authentic recipes from"" series is just a rehash of the ""food of series"" with a few subtle changes such as relacing obscure recipes with more recognisable ones, bigger font and format, less on the history and some updated pictures.Overall I kind of like the recipes in the new books more as there is less filler and odd recipes, but I do like the layout and format of the older hardcover ""food of"" books. So if you own ""the food of"" and want to get this book, be prepared to sell it off as you will only end up doubling up 90% of recipes between the 2."
3,Lack of color,"Good food, along with its recipe and how to, is also about presentation. This book lacks the beautiful color pictures that means a thousand words."
1,Wasted my money!,"This book is bad in so many ways. It has very few recipes and is not worth it's price. The recipes it does have are for strange dishes most of which I (who's vietnamese and has grown up on authentic Vietnamese food) have never heard of and would never try (frog's legs??!!?). I'm sure there's someone out there who would eat these exotic harder-than-worth-to-make dishes but good luck to that person since the instructions are unclear,undetailed, and overall very poorly written."
4,Nice bag,"Nice carrier. Quite impressively made, seems very sturdy and tough, although I have not had the chance to try it out yet, but from what I can tell should work as a wonderful on board carrier for a puppy (which is what I am planning for) or a very small dog (like a chihuahua)."
2,not as great as I hoped,"I really wanted to love this bag but I had to return it. It was perfect in every way except that it didnt have a sturdy frame and one side kept collapsing down from being folded in its box. No matter what I did it would not straighen out and since it didnt have a sturdy frame it would have squished the dog! 5 stars for interior padding, and style though."
3,Great style and features.,"Love the style and versatility of this product. From carry to shoulder to backpack. Love the openness for ventilation. But there are two things that are very frustrating and hard to use.1. The leash hook in the carrier. It is located on the inside top middle of the carrier. Very hard to get at when you can't see inside, especially with a squirming puppy. If it was located on the bottom at either end, it would be easier.2. Use as a car seat. Attaching and unattaching the carrier is a process, not at all easy to do. There are no instructions, just pictures and that does not help. It would be much easier if you could just slip the car seat belt through the carrier.Haven't used it on a plane as yet, this is what I purchased it for. I will be getting a separate seat to use in the car."
2,well made but collapses on puppy,"I was so excited to get this carrier and as soon as I opened it I knew it was well made. The size is perfect for my papillon puppy with lots of ventilation. My one problem with this carrier is that it does not hold it's shape and the top constantly collapses on my puppy. I finally had to have my husband build a frame out of plastic to fit inside of the carrier so that I could continue using it. The plastic frame helps the carrier hold it's shape. At first I thought it was because Amazon packaged it wrong and if I continued to use it it would eventually hold it's shape but that was not the case at all and after a month of use it was worse than when I first received it. This could be a problem with many soft carriers but I would be careful on future purchases since a 10"" high crate can actually turn into a 6"" crate if the top sags."
5,perfect for air travel,I bought this bag for my 4 lb Yorkie to travel in when we fly. It is the perfect size for her. The pad inside is washable. I place a towel under the pad and put some velcro on the pad to keep it secure. She likes it so much I also use it in the car. I can leave the end window open and secure her with the leash inside the carrier.
4,Great Workout,"Not only do you learn choreography to songs like Overprotected by Britney and My Love is Like Wo by Mya, you get to see the whole process of audition and preparation to be a dancer for Brian Friedman. There is also interviews with the celebrities he has worked with and an actual warm-up exercise video included. My only problem with the main feature is the mirror-image used to make it. Unlike a video where if the subject spins right you do, everything goes the other way, so you'll have to actually listen and not just watch to get the choreography right."
2,"Entertaining? Yes, Useful? No","This is an amateurish attempt at best. The promise of dancing like professional pop stars is just that, a broken promise. The moves are complicated and the videography looks like my little 12 year old nephew did it with our handycam. Thoroughly unimpressed."
1,A WARNING IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO GET THESE,"I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"Love these DVDs! Recording has never been easier! I've used around 30 of them, and not one coaster yet. That's a much better result than my CD recording which always results in a coaster here and there..."
2,Inconsistent Quality Is Disappointing,"I've purchased many 25 pack and 50 pack spindles of this product just because it was the least bad brand of media I knew of. The fact was that in some spindles I could get almost no coasters, while in some I would end up with only half the discs being usable. I don't really like spending money on crap quality products and I believe most others feel the same way. If you are one of these people, I HIGHLY recommend the Ri-Data 4x media (both -R and +R) or the TDK +R's (I haven't tried TDK -R's) instead of this. I have gone through about 100 of the Ri-Data discs so far and about 25 of the TDK's and have yet to burn even one single coaster on my Sony DRU-500A. Trust me, you'll like the other brands much better."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I got these to use with our Panasonic DVDR because the price was too good to pass up. A few of them worked, but then the DVDR started to lock up every time I tried to dub to a disc. I tried several different discs from the package and kept having the same problem. I was convinced that I had somehow broken the machine.At the suggestion of Panasonic tech support, I tried a different brand of disc and have not had any more problems. These went in the trash!"
1,"Errors, errors, errors","Beware -- these DVD disks are terrible! Over half of them end up not readable or contain errors or glitches. In contrast, I don't have any problems when using Verbatim or Sony DVD disks at all."
1,Ruined a good thing,"I've always had good luck with Memorex DVD-R's until this new batch came out (with the Attention Pioneer, etc. label on top). Most of what I have tried to burn on my Sony DRU-500A end up ruined as well as attempts to burn on my Toshiba Satellite notebook burner. Tried TDK's and they work fine, so I know it's a compatibility problem with the Memorex discs. What a shame. One step forward six steps back!"
1,Does not work with Toshiba Laptops,"Said it didn't work with Pioneer DVD-R drives, and it doesn't work with Toshiba either. TDK and even CompUSA DVD-R's work fine. Memorex should work harder to make sure their disks work with all DVD-R's."
1,14% Defective Rate !!! :-(,"Tried 21 discs in either a Toshiba laptop internal DVD-R/RAM drive or a BUSlink USB external DVD+/-R/RW drive. 3 discs were defective, and 5 more were rendered useless because they were part of backup sets that cancelled when the DVD-R went bad. 3 of 21 is a 14% error rate. 8 of 21 tried that are now useless is a 39% loss rate! Not sure if ""supposedly good"" burns will stay good (poor quality DVDs can stop being readable unpredictably). Trying to return the bad and unused 37 DVD-Rs takes 3 weeks if they will do it at all and if you don't have to resubmit your request to wait another 3 weeks!"
4,we want more,This was Luis Enrique's last salsa cd. It's a great one. Asi es La Vida is an excellant salsa tune with a powerful message. The rythyms will keep you dancing. I wish that Luis will return to his salsa music. His last two albums of pop in spanish did not so too well. Please Luis if you ever read this: WE ALL MISS THE SALSA! Please do your next album in salsa.
2,Ils - Bohemia,"On BOHEMIA, ILS' third album, he gets much more aggressive. ""Tiny Toy,"" for instance, throws in electric guitar stabs, like it's trying to rock out, and even though ""Angels"" has some pretty female vocals, they're subsidiary to the beat. But this could be true of any track: ""Cherish"" disappears underneath the waves of sound. Some of the tracks, though, seem pretty thin to start out with; the lyrics of ""Feed the Addiction"" don't do anything to save it; better to have done something with the time-stretched Asian vocal in the background. ""Storm from the East"" does better in this regard, adding some actual tonal interest to the breaks, and ""Precious"" and ""Loving You"" slow things down enough to enjoy the musicianship a little more. As well, the strings that kick off ""Over My Head"" are compelling but these are only a few tracks amongst many."
3,Interesting atmospherics,"The singer sounds corny but the cumbias rock - on occasion. Not the best of this group, but there's enough fire to make it a keeper. According to ""The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,"" Billboard Books, Mr. Chivo's ""Specialty has been funny cumbias with catchy phrases and lots of sticky dance hooks."" Maybe in their heyday, but not on this current CD where the music seems watered down. ""Ya No seas Asi,"" and ""Baila,"" are really cool, snappy and catchy."
2,It tastes like .. well...cinnamon.,I was expecting some interesting exotic flavor but I was disappointed to discover that it tastes about like ordinary cinnamon I buy at the supermarket.
1,cray-zee,"This author is a certified nut. The only purpose of this book is to sell extremely expensive herbal and floral extracts. She is obviously delusional and I can't belive that she could actually write and publish a book. I was expecting something on the edge, something of a spritual nature, but this is ridiculous. Buy it and you will get a good laugh, your friends will get a good laugh too - because you spent money on this hogwash."
2,Reality Check.,"If, like most people, you're a weekend gardner and don't have a lot of time, then this book is not for you. And if you do have a lot of time to spend on your garden, then you don't need this book."
5,Excellent - gardening for the future,"Believe me, this style of gardening works! My garden has never looked better with less work on my part. An excellent book -- even for the skeptical. Some of it sounds far out -- but I have found it all to be true. Just hang in there with it -- nature is waiting work with you!"
5,Grounds-up teaching and learning,"Terrific explanations and a palpable enthusiasm for nature as well as gardening. I learned so much and am feeling much more confident about gardening than I ever would have believed possible. I think the concept of ""co-creative"" work with nature is positively the way we need to go."
2,Tedious and stultifying,"There is nothing in here that you can't also do with a good, basic course in Shamanism. Learn to talk to the nature spirits and Devas yourself! Goodness. I know she's trying to do a Good Thing here, but jeez - the lists and lists of step-by-step, you-must-do-it-this-way-and-buy-my-expensive-essences stuff gets old. Seriously. Learn shamanism. Talk to the plants and nature spirits and Pan yourself."
5,Beautiful Illustration work,"A technical genius of the graphic novel, frezzato brings a new and fresh style of sketch and pastel to his art work that has only been seen in other such comics as Books of Magic. His creative work is favorable and loveable and at some points very abstract, yet heartfelt. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in seeing the drawings behind the paint of Frezzato's beautifully rendered comics."
2,Could be a lot better,"The only way to really get any use out of this book is to read the papers that it uses as references. Most of the equations have been copied incorrectly from the original papers, and many of the key variables are never defined in the text of the book. Overall, it was pretty frustrating to try to use as a textbook. In my phased array antenna class, we invariably had to find the IEEE papers used as references and read them to make any sense of the book."
3,Faulty Update,"I purchased this book because I thought it'll be an update of the author'sclassic 'Microwave Scanning Antenna' containing new material as well. During my review of the book and identifying a lot of flaw equations, I started deriving them myself or grabbed the corresponding papers which were referenced. So to recap the lessons learnt so far, I would recommend not to solely rely on this book but be cautious (especially when using the equations) and use the reference list and/or stick to the old 'Microwave Scanning Antennas' released in the 60s."
3,flawed update of a classic,This book is riddled with errors. You can do a web search for the author and title to get the author's web page with two pages of corrections.The book is a follow on for the authors older book Scanning Microwave Antennas. The new book has fewer pages and therefore leaves much of the older book out. It does contain new material though.I would suggest buying the older book first (available used here on Amazon) and only buy this book if you are deeply into antenna design.
1,Software nightmare,"This product is a total con - I ordered it on Amazon.com and received just one CD in the box, no instructions even for installation. The CD only installs the Greenstreet Font Manager - try to install any fonts from it and get an unavoidable and inexplicable error where it can't read from the install CD for any of the fonts. The real kicker is when you open any other major application on your computer and find that the default fonts have been replaced with totally illegible characters (this occurred for Photoshop, Visio, and even Windows itself). Uninstall the Font Manager and the issue persists. Have fun emailing the blackhole of Summitsoft tech support - they can't even post a FAQ page to their juvenile website or have the decency to send a default message promising any response or resolution. This product is a total waste of money and time."
3,golf courses of the carribean,"for the listed courses, the information is pretty completetitle is misleading because not all carribean courses were listedno information on st thomas or st croix to name two islands"
3,Hardhitting and real,"Little Joe has been a spokesman for Mexican-Americans and Tejano for so many years, it is hard to believe. ""Las Nubes"" is simply great. Music reporter Ramiro Burr hit it right on the head when he described Little Joe: ""With his big band approach and marvelous knack for recording hard-hitting rancheras, Little Joe rose to the top of Tejano music in the mid '70s, a wild boomtown period considered the genre's first golden age. At his peak Little Joe evoked a dangerous edge in his music, combining the power of the blues and the free-wheeling spirit of rock to propel his robust fusion of the blistering Mexican ranchera and the life-affirming Tejano polka,"" in his solid work ""The Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music."" This is really great."
2,Doesn't do well in cold winter weather,"I bought three of these to replace existing lights of the same make and model that were 9 years old. The metal fixtures of the existing lights were splitting. Knowing what I know now, I would look for something more durable.If you live in a warmer climate with little precipitation or wind, these will be fine. They are very attractive and distinctive."
2,Not the best of the Trek bios,"Having read every Star Trek (TOS) autobiography (though I only got about half-way through Walter Koenig's story) I can say this is not the best example of Leonard Nimoy's body of work.You would be much, much better advised to pick up a copy of Grace Lee Whitney's heart-wrenching book, ""My Tour of the Galaxy,"" or the late James Doohan's ""Beam Me Up, Scotty,"" which is easily the most interesting Trek autobiography, overall. Herbert F. Solow's recent book, detailing the highs and lows of the ""orginal series"" is full of shocks and fascinating details unavailable in the other tell-all books, but it may put you off Star Trek for six to twelve months, it's so unforgiving of creator Gene Roddeberry, and to a lesser extent, of Mr. Nimoy, and William Shatner.Richard GreenSt. Louis"
3,Good Book but Expensive,"This book was very good read but I felt it did not tell me enough about Leonard Nimoy. He basically mentions is work only. Nothing about his upbringing and childhood. Mind you the book and is thin i.e. only 130 odd pages. I greatly enjoyed the Dialogues between Nimoy and Spock and I liked the introspective thoughts of the first few chapters where Nimoy wonders who Spock is. It's a daft thing to complain about but I found it confusing that the anecdotes changed mid-chapter without a line break. I kept looking for some connection that was not there until I got used to it. It's great that I don't have to wait 20 years to read ""I am Spock""."
2,Who edited this book?,"Today my class did the first section of Practice TOEFL 6 from this book. In the first 30 questions, there were at least4 typographical errors. Then we discovered that the answer keyin the back didn't match the test. I have been frustrated with this book in the past because of weak or inaccurate grammar explanations, but this was ridiculous. I really like the idea of a strategy-based TOEFL text, but this book seems like it would be more confusing than helpful."
4,A Little Book on Basset Hounds,"A review of: Basset Hounds A Andrews and McMeel gift bookFirst of all, this is a tiny book measuring only about 3 inches by 4 inches, but it's packed with interesting and useful information as well as the predictably adorable photos of basset hounds. It starts with an informative history of bassets then gives a detailed description of the ""breed standard"", the characteristics judges use at dog shows. Then there's very practical advice about choosing a puppy, caring for and bonding with your puppy and some general information about training and care. There's still a lot to know about raising a dog that isn't covered in such a short book, but a surprising amount of information is included between these tiny covers, and it takes at most half an hour to read it all."
3,Oldies but still goodies,"I found that on each of these DVDs there is one movie that is not so good, but that is just my taste. For the price, three out of four film noir are excellent. An excellent buy for mystery buffs who like the black and white classics. By the way, it's fun to see Peter Lorre as young and thin!"
5,Re: I loved this book!,"This book is about a 15-year-old girl named Chloe Peterson. She is a normal teenager and she is very active in drama,until she gets a virus that she can't seem to shake off.She goes to her doctor and she is given vitamins for her ""stress"". Then,she gets a really bad sunburn in the middle of March,and she starts feeling horrible.She ends up fainting at a tryout for ""The Sound of Music"" and she lands in the hospital,where she is diagnosed with lupus.She has to learn how to live her life with lupus,and she learns to cope with a disease that is unpredictable.This book was important to me,because my mother also has lupus. I was devastated until I learned that survival is very well. I learned a lot from this book,and I hope people will benefit from it"
2,Not that great,"This story is about a girl named Chloe Peterson. She is an average teenager until she finds out that she has a chronic disease called systemic lupis erythatosous or ""Lupus."" The whole story she feels sorry for herself and to tell you the truth i was quite disapointed, especially with the ending. I don't really reccomend this book."
3,Target Training,"I purchased the Tony Little target training on VHS when it originally came out in 1999. I like the bun & thigh edition and the ab workout edition. I decided it was time to upgrade to DVD so i ordered this total body shape up dvd. I was disappointed to find that it does include bun & thigh workouts and arm, chest , & back- but NO AB Workouts. Without the ab workout i don't believe that it qualifies as total body."
3,"Liderazgo, valores y cultura organizacional",Soy profesor universitario y me interesa revisar este libro para adquirirlo si me es últil
4,liked it!,"Very cute, light read. Our hero, a captain who is also a nobleman, is really likeable. He is appointed as bodyguard to a princess of a small country near Italy who has come to England for refuge from the French (and also so she can secretly guard a fortune in jewels). She's at first very spoiled and selfish, as a princess might be expected to be. However the captain's manner towards her quickly turns that around- a little too quickly though! I felt it was very unrealistic for someone's whole manner to be so quickly changed by someone saving her life. I mean, we're talking about a lifetime of habits here!But that aside we had great chemistry b/t them. My only complaint is I felt that they got together too soon in the book.Good story too, it will keep you reading. Basically it involves a gang trying to kill the princess."
3,"Mysterious, surreal, almost incomprehensible","I ran across this book in my search for mysteries written by Native Americans. The jacket blurb and book reviews made it sound intriguing and worth picking up to read.The story line weaves back and forth between murders set in present day California and Spanish Colonial times.Owens prose is haunting; his images catch just at the edge of the reader's mind. Ok, one asks, is this happening today? Or 300 years ago? Is it real? (whatever that means.) Or just one of the protagonist's screwy dreams?Frankly, I got exhausted trying to figure out where and when I was supposed to be. I fought my way through several hundred pages, searching for a plot I could hang on to. We finally got there, but by that time I had become bored with Cole - the angst-ridden, usually drunk, central character.Maybe I'm just old fashioned - I like my mysteries to unfold in a more or less straight line. Too much poetry, imagery, and symbolism for my taste."
3,Varying quality,My experience is that the quality of this Memorex +RW media varies. I have perhaps burned about 80 of these and about 1-2 in every ten runs into problems. In some cases I was able to use problem DVD:s if I set the burning to ca 4.5 instead of the default 4.7 but sometimes the media could not be used at all.I use a NEC ND-1300A and I guess the Plextor mentioned is better so it is probable that with a better burner you may fair better (But the NEC is NOT considered to be a low quality burner!).In the same time I have also burned about 80 TDK media and not run into any problems at all. Not one single problem with the TDK media.This is my personal experience. A good place with information from others can be found at http://www.videohelp.com/
2,NOT for DVD Recorders,"I have bought these discs for my DVD recorder, and I've encountered that it fails quite a few times with these discs. I called a technical support agent and he said that their recorders aren't the only ones with trouble with these Memorex discs. Several other recorders from other companies had trouble with these discs. I have heard, however, that when run on a computer, they have no problems at all. So, if you're using them for a computer, by all means, use them. But if you're using a DVD Recorder, do not, I repeat, DO NOT use them (although they do not fail ALL the time). Thank you for listening."
5,Beautiful,"If you can't go to Hawaii in person, this is the next best thing. There is so many beautiful places to see in the state. I have been to Hawaii three times, and still haven't seen all there is to see."
4,Over Hawaii,Beautiful views of Hawaii. They showed parts of Maui (Road to Hana) that I didn't see when I was there. Stunning.
3,"not bad, but NOT Planet Earth quality","I was excited to watch this disc after catching of few minutes of the Tv version. Unfortunately when projected onto a super large screen the video deficiencies are more apparent. I also did not care for any of the music. I do not want to see a person strumming and singing crappy Hawaiin music when I watch a nature video. I only want to see nature. Overall it had some nice shots but I wish it was $5 instead of $15. I also bought over Alaska (for $5) and can say I liked that better overall than this production. Not bad, but please keep your expectations low as this in nowhere near the quality of the Planet Earth, Life, or Frozen Planet series."
5,OVER HAWAII,THE VIEWS AND THE COMMENTARY WAS JUST GREAT. WE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF THE PLACES AND IT WAS GREAT TO SEE FROM THE AIR AND ALSO HAVE THE COMMEDTARY WITH THE MUSIC
3,Can't wait to get there.,"My other half and I planning to go to Hawaii in the near future and was excited to see it finally arrive in the mail. Literally when they say Over Hawaii, that is what this film is all about. It takes you to places mainly only seen by air. It will have you definitely want to take a helicopter ride."
5,Fantastic,This is a wonderful product. I love the Islands and this affords me a regular sweep through them all. It is so peaceful and serene to watch. You can even turn the sound down and let your mind fly along the cliffs and valleys. It makes for a lovely meditation for your soul. I love it.
5,Saw on ETV and fell in love,Photography is awesome and so peaceful to watch. ETV wanted a gift to get this same DVD. Anyone who has been to Hawaii will enjoy immensely.
4,Amazing aerial footage,While not complete and somewhat disappointing on certain islands there is enough to justify the price tag. The spectacular footage that is here will take you up canyons and into areas that simply cannot be done any other way. I wanted more on Kauai but perhaps I could never get enough.
3,Very Good,had to settle for the DVD version because the blu ray version that I recieved would not work. Is there any way I can return this item? It's too bad I was really looking forward to the blu ray version.
1,Didn't Work,I tried to play this the other night and got an error message that it wouldn't work. I'll probably try again but am very disappointed.
4,Poking fun at life,"A collection of columns from the ""York Independent,"" Fabiano's first book takes a humorous look at life in York, Maine, in all its seasonal aspects, from the first (and last) jog of the season to wienie roasts at the beach and his wife's coveted summer pesto.Fabiano examines the perils of the ""kid zone"" at the beach and the plight of tourists in rule-bound trailer camps, but mostly the butt of the joke is himself - sneaking swigs of A-1 steak sauce or spoonfuls of relish as snacks, trying to fulfill his destiny as barbecue king, enduring visits to the dentist, holding onto holey favorite shirts, taking four women to an Andrea Boccelli concert.A number of columns address the perils of turning 50. One of the funniest - really - is a description of the author's first colonoscopy. Fabiano's wife plays the straight man in many of these pieces and comes off as a very good sport. Funny, curmudgeonly, and self-deprecating, Fabiano should win new fans."
1,Public domain garbage,"Roger Corman's films have been the unfortunate victim of many terrible releases; this is one of them. While the print quality varies, it's mostly subpar to unwatchable. How these companies stay in business is a mystery when the product is so bad. There are much better transfers on some of these titles (The Terror, one of the most widely available in terrible prints, was just released in a pristine DVD and Blu-ray combo). Don't be fooled by the low price; this isn't worth a nickel."
3,"Not that bad, guys.","I picked this up at Best Buy for $4.99 and was expecting much worse picture and sound than I ended up with. These are cheap old movies, they aren't going to look like a restored Blu Ray. I was happy with the quality."
4,Dean gets taken by a Russian Sec boss Slaver,"While Ryan and the gang are elsewhere, Dean is grabbed by A Russian Slaver from Jak's farm to work at a sulfur mining colony. .....needless to say Ryan takes this a bit personally and embarks on a bloody mission to get back his son. Definately worth the wait it took to find a copy. PLEASE REPRINT MORE OF AXLER'S EARLIER BOOKS."
5,Great Customer Serivce,"My husband ordered this hat, and is happy with it. The company it comes from (Texas American Safety Company) has an amazing customer service you just don't hear of anymore. I would recommend anyone in the market for a hard hat to order from them!"
2,Abe Lincoln influence,"I am sure that this hard hat is safe and all, but it sits on top of my head like Abe Lincoln's stove pipe hat-it's really tall."
5,Great Production,"As an LDS church member, the story line was quite authentic and believable. The acting was good and the production very good."
4,Brilliant!,"The Tindersticks are one of the greatest British pop bands around, yet they don't have a record deal anymore in the states. At an in-store performance I saw young women swooning over the boys in the band, yet you'll never see them on the T.V. Their music is haunting (though slightly pop on this one) and brilliant. But unless you slap down the cash for the import, you'll miss out. Too bad."
2,Not what I was expecting,"After I read the reviews and was sucked into the buzz, I had fairly decent expectations for this movie but honestly was disappointed. I was expecting them to take better care with the franchise then to have a really loose tie-in with another agent who was on the hunt for some pills(?) Yes. That was literally the plot. Finding pills. There was no main action set piece and it was just muddled throughout. I thought Skyfall was better than this and that was -eh- as well."
2,Disappointing,"After watching the first 3 Bourne movies, which I considered spectacular, this was a tremendous letdown. I really enjoyed the characterizations of the first 3, but this seemed hollow to me."
2,"kinda boring, big name actors mailing it in",This was a totally forgettable movie with great actors just straight up mailing in their performances. Pass on this one.
3,Not worth buying!,Decent storyline but Renner's character was not a suitable replacement for Jason Bourne. Hoping for Damon and Greengrass to bring the series back to life.
3,Disappointing,"Loved the other 3 Bourne flicks. I have no idea what the plot was in this one. Just seemed to meander on. Awesome action scenes and stellar cinematography.They made some attempt to tie it in with the other 3, but it was pretty weak. Probably would have made a better movie on it's own with a more in-depth story line.Won't be buying this one, or ever watching it again."
2,Not a Bourne Movie - don't waste your time,"A lot of good actors go to waste in a Bourne wannabe...they cleverly tie the beginning of this movie in with the ending of Ultimatum like the two are happening at the same time. Rachel Weisz tries very hard to act here but doesn't. Also you don't really understand what the plot is except for...uh...they're trying to create supersoldiers? Right, it might be believable to 8-year-old boys. When CIA finds out where Aaron Cross is they send an asset after him who is hinted as being ""without emotion"". How'd they manage to remove emotion from somebody? Brainwashing? Lobotomy? Where do they get these guys? Worse thing is, they leave the ending open for another movie. Nooooooo!!!!! For me the Bourne series ended with Ultimatum. Don't bother seeing this one."
2,Not that good.,"Bellow average action film.Much like the Bourne book trilogy, the movie trilogy should've been left alone.Somehow the feeling of the original movies is missing from this one. The cast is solid and preforms well. Action is well shot and acted out. Plot is very bland and not very detailed.I recommend watching it once and then moving on to something else."
1,What a disgrace to the Bourne series!,"Do not even waste your time, I have no clue why Ed Norton agreed to act in this terrible filem..."
1,Bourne Legacy,"As of Dec 24@8:21 I still haven,t recieved it yet. I guess that it is coming by snail mail.As of rite now ,I don,t know if I,ll order agin."
1,The Bourne Legacy,No script--one long chase. Facile ending--will not dignify as a conclusion which implies content. Soooo grateful that I had not paid full freight at the theater!
1,Nothing Close to the originals!!!!,The quality was great. The action was great. However movies have to be more than that now especially if your going to continue a saga like this one. I was super excited to see this and then I ended up falling asleep in the middle of it because there was no suspence. The marketing was awesome on this one however because they managed to get me to watch it just because of the previous movies. To some it up...Go watch Nikita its way better!!!!
2,Complex Convoluted Plot; Didn't Understand It,"I rented this film expecting an action flick and what I got instead was a scientific thriller that just didn't make any sense to me. There was quite a bit of talking while Renner's character, Aaron Cross pops these pills in between brief action scenes. I'm a pharmacist and couldn't really understand what Renner was taking these pills for? I assume it had to do with a virus, but this in itself didn't make much sense. Also, how Rachel Weisz's character plays a role in this plot too confused me. Overall, I would pass on this one."
2,not the best movie,can not be compared with the past onesdfsfsdfsdffff fff fff fff fff fff fff fff fff fff fffff ff
4,"not as good as the Damon trilogy, but not bad on its own.","it is hard not to be biased against this kind of change in a movie franchise, but this movie delivered what you want from an action-packed spy thriller. I didn't find it as good as any of the Damon movies, but i still feel it deserves a good rating on its own merit."
3,Just okay...,"As a big fan of the Bourne series, I had high expectations and was looking forward to The Bourne Legacy! The movie had great action scenes, but the story line and overall move fell way short to what I was expecting."
2,"Bourne schmourn, not even close!","I have seen each of the three (3) original Bourne films many, many times. They're so good you can see them over and over and never get bored. The newest, The Bourne Legacy, was a huge let-down. After watching it, I felt deflated. No WOW! factor. It ended, seemingly in the middle of the movie, without a resolution. The bad guys don't get theirs, and you you aren't certain if the good guys really got away. I watched it again, with the closed caption on and got a lot more out of the movie, since much of the dialog was Project Names, Acronyms, etc. and a lot was said under breath, that you couldn't know what was going on until much later in the movie, and too late to bother going back. Bottom line - A poor movie to have the Bourne name attached."
2,Very boring and not enough action,The movie is nowhere as good as the old bourne movies. Little fighting and the story is lame. I wish I could get my money and time back
2,Jam-packed with boring scenes,Long boring scenes without much action. Lacks a good plot and tries to make a dull story into something somewhat complex. The expected idiotic scene of a guy sitting in front of Congress and the almost expected anticlimatic end... What a waste of a good action actor.
4,Bourne,"Good action suspense movie to watch. Kinda short episode cuz I'm not satisfied, wanted more from the movie. But very good to watch from the HD tv at home."
3,ok,"it was ok. kinda slow. the jason bourne ones were better, minimum words requirement on this is stupid. you're welcome"
2,Wild,I needed to much imagination to understand the main Idea....but the actors where OK...for no rational thinking to achive the goals.
4,The Borne Legacy,"Good movie, can pretty much stand on its own. Good action/story. It won't blow your mind or anything, but if you haven't seen it yet and you're looking for a rental, this should do it."
4,"Downloaded, on PS3, via Amazon",I rented this via Amazon and the movie was good; if you are a fan of the series. The quality was full HD and the process was simple.
2,Bad Movie...,Plot was terrible and the ending was even worse. It was a problem that it had not much to do with the first 3 originals - it was just plain bad.
2,Audio fluctuated wildly and storyline was out there...very disappointing!,Audio fluctuated wildly and storyline was out there...very disappointing! I would only watch this if HBO or Showtime had on--don't pay for it!
3,"Good, but doesn't have the same punch as other Bourne movies","less urgency and the story doesn't grab youi as much as the other Bourne movies Don't get me wrong, I watched it all the way through, but didn't love it"
3,The Bourne Legacy,I found it to be quite boring. It was very slow compared to the original ones. I am not a fan of car chases.
2,Same old,"Not very innovative. Jeremy Renner is dull. Story line a bit too ridiculous. Could be the end of a ""Legacy""."
4,Entertaining BUT.....,Anyone expecting to see another great movie with Matt will be disappointed. The plot is messed-up and quirky. All that being said once you get beyond the first fifteen minutes of the movie it becomes another global chase adventure around the world. So sit back and forget about the past and enjoy the ride.
3,Good not the best in the series,"The movie was fun to watch, however, the previous movies were better. Nothing against Jeremy Renner but I believe Matt Damen was a better fit."
3,Plot Sucks !!,This film was all over the place !! Someone please take the crack pipe away from the director !!! YIKES !!!
4,Fun,"Entertaining, good twists, Fun flick...the only thing that bothered me was the motor cycle chase. Seems receptive from previous Bournes."
2,"What Was The Point, Really?","I liked the first (couple) of Bourne movies and I really like Jeremy Renner and although it had been pretty much panned, I thought I'd give this movie a whirl. Sometimes, too much whirling leads to hurling, as in this case. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good. The motive of the bad guys (my favorite bad guys, the guvnment) was muddy, the process ill-defined and the ending just tacked on without any closure (and without leaving us open for another movie to straighten the whole mess out).Save your time -- pass this one."
1,Boring Legacy would be a better name,"You should consideer this movie as a very long trailer for the next in the series. Just as a semblance of a plot was about to develop, the movie ends. Previously you had the same old car chases, rooftop chases, and tough guy montage ala Rocky training in Russia."
3,Disappointing mess,"I like my spy movies to flow from one good scene to another, with a clear plot and a lot of action. There are exceptions when someone else really does an impressive variation on this, but The Bourne Legacy falls flat."
1,"Confusing, Ludicrous",Don't miss the first three or four minutes or you will wind up wondering what the ..... is going on!An absolute waste of 2+ hours. Should have just gone back and watched all three of the original Bournes.
1,One of the top 5 WORST movies!,"We felt cheated out of a Bourne movie!! In no way was this even close to ""good""! Where was the smart writing, where was the action, chase scenes (until the end..and then they made up time and it was 20 min.!) and where was BOURNE?"
4,Surprisingly good,"I expected to be disappointed in this movie, so I watched it with reservations. I was pleasantly surprised in the film."
4,Fitting for a Bourne feature,I enjoyed the movie. I think Jeremy Renner is a nice transition from Matt Damon. He will carry on the legacy well.
4,When will the next one be out?,"I would have given it a 5 if the action sequences were not so choppy and throughout the dialogue I found myself asking, "" what did they say and what does it mean?""I am glad the ""Legacy"" did not stop with Jason Bourne.The extremism of this movie is awesome. I found myself holding my breath at times."
3,Disappointing,I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I've seen all the others and couldn't wait for this one. The plot just didn't take off. The characters were fine.
3,wham bamm,lots of wham bam in this movie...not sure they did much for the franchise though...super genetically enhanced dude kind of takes it to somewhere else than the the original movies....
4,Not Damon but still ok,"Great action scenes, nice fight scenes, a few eye rolling scenes, but overall a good action flick. Not a good Bourne movie IMO. Worth a watch."
1,Boring,"The plot line was almost nil. I knew some guy was being chased, but nothing made me care if they caught him. Absolutely no character development."
2,Boring,Bad storyline and boring. I know why Matt Damon did not come back for this installment. I would pass on this one.
3,Fair,"Decent action movie, weak plot, not near as good as the first! The cast was good, but just needed a stronger, clearer story line."
3,Why the bad reviews?,Not sure why I saw some bad reviews. This movie stays on the same story line as the other Bournes just with a different main character. Great close quarter battle and chase scenes thought the movie. This movie is not an Oscar but very entertaining none the less. Rent it.
3,like the Bourne series,"Like the acting and the action, but found this particular movie a bit confusing.jeremy renner was excellent and the movie kept my interest but feel I should watch it again to fully understand all the characters and their involvement."
4,Excellent movie,I like all the Bourne movies and thought this was an excellent addition. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the story seemed to jump around a little and I thought the usual chase scene at the end was too long.
3,Just Okay,"I like the Jason Bourne movies. Great actors! Plot seems to be the same. Expected more. Just okay, glad I didn't purchase."
2,Stick a fork in the Bourne franchise!,"Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon. There were some other questionable casting decisions too. For example, the Doctor on the run with Renner's character was awful! The Bourne formula is getting old. The pacing of this movie was way too slow, as well as having a predictable and boring plot. Gilroy better get Damon back or this franchise is in the toilet!"
2,Why is it so expensive to rent?,$5 to rent this movie? New movies go for $4. Why the premium? This movie wasn't good. In fact I would recommend a $3 price tag on it. Definitely the worst Bourne movie so far. I was bored most of the movie and couldn't care less about the characters.
3,Not so good,It was not as good as the Bourne Trilogy. Didn't like that they changed the agents to being on drugs.
3,its okay,the movie was not thrilling enough for me. i really enjoyed the original 1st 3 bourne movies this one storyline just didnt cut it.
3,I blame the script...,"I can't really blame the actors... it's the script. While there were some moments, overall, the movie bored me and I LOVE the previous Bourne movies. It wasn't ""bad"" but it certainly wasn't ""great""."
4,Not bad,This movie was ok. The story was interesting and the action was good.Worth watching if you have nothing else to do.
4,Entertaining,"Liked this much more than expected. It was a bit confusing until we realized that the story line is happening synonymously with the other Bourne movies, not after as we had thought."
2,They should have let this one rest.,"I usually like sequels, and thought I would really like this one because the first 3 were so good. But this slow, boring, and just not interesting. I tried to like it, but was disappointed."
5,Great movie,Love the series and this a great addition. The action is good and the story line is great. A must see for Bourne fans. However if you haven't seen the other Bourne movies you won't even begin to understand this one.
3,Flat and 2 dimensional,"I read all of Robert Ludlum's books, some twice because the changed the artwork on the cover and suckered me into buying them again. I liked many parts of the movie but the breaks and gaps make it hard to follow smoothly and enjoy. I suspect the lead actors and director are not happy with the final cut. I wasn't."
3,Not Enough Substance,Overall the story was interesting but much of the movie is stretched out. There is far too much time spent between the two main characters arguing where I found myself thinking I wish they would just do something. Add that to the end chase scene which seems to go on for ever and is just too unbelievable. The guy chasing them seems like a T-1000 terminator that can't get hurt and no matter how many times it seems that he would have lost them picks up their trail instantly like in any Tommy Lee Jones movie where he is tracking someone. Overall the movie seemed to have too much filler.
3,Weakest of the Bournes,"Several other reviews have already gone into great depth of this movie's contents, this is just a summary of my personal opinion about the movie. As the rating indicates, it was ok. I'm not someone who expects each sequel to dial it up a notch, but Renner was not allowed to portray the same degree of deadliness that Damon was or the same degree of craftiness/awareness. Still I watched it and got a modest enjoyment out of it."
4,Bourne action flick without Bourne,"I always loved Matt Damon as Bourne so this movie was a lesser movie only for that reason. The storyline, characters, and set pieces were all very well done and the movie was no disappointment. It is hard to discuss much about the movie without giving spoilers so if you liked the original Bourne series you will like the Legacy."
3,Moderately Entertaining,"Not as good as the Matt Damon series. Enjoyable, but nothing earth-shattering. No true chemistry between the two main characters."
3,Good Sequel,"If your a fan of Bourne, then this movie is for you. Renner does a good job playing the hero. I didn't care for the ending, but solid action throughout."
2,Weak story,"While the film has some good acting and decent action sequences, the story is a muddled mess that not only fails to advance the Bourne franchise, but manages to diminish the saga.The ending in particular is weak and unsatisfying. The producers were obviously hoping to set up another series, forgetting that audiences need to enjoy the first movie before they'll buy a ticket for the sequel. Take a pass."
3,"Great trailer for the next Bourne film. ""Bourne Again""?","Renner is very good, and the action sequences are well done. More of the Bourne world is fleshed out, but in the end I was left wondering what the point of the whole movie was. It felt like I had watched a really great trailer for the real film."
3,Hard to Follow,I've always found the Bourne movies a little hard to follow. This one was no different. My husband thought it was slow.
2,"NOT a ""Bourne Movie""!",Definitely NOT a Bourne movie! Mildly entertaining. If I had it to do over I would wait until this movie hits Netflix before watching it.
4,Bourne Legacy,"I chose this rating because the movie was great, but not excellent.What I disliked about this movie, was the fact that it lacked substance, and a real element of suspense.I would recommend this movie to action seekers."
5,good flick,"This movie has much excitment, action and wishful thinking for the teen in you life.RATE it 5 stars for everyone"
3,Lots of action,"This was a pretty good movie, but I kept waiting for Jason Bourne to be involved. There are lots of sticky situations for the main character to get out of, and many chases."
4,This was okay,"Not anything like the Bourne movies but it was okay. I guess this way we know that we already knew, that there are other people in the program. Sure miss Jason. Nothing can compair."
3,No,"Should not have been released. After Matt Damon, the movie franchise ended. We all knew it wasn't gonna continue once he left. I'm a Renner fan, but this was a horrible sequel."
4,liked the movie,"Along the same story line at the previous Bourne movies. If you liked them, I think you will like this movie"
2,Great potential but poor execution.,Great potential but poor execution. The plot seems to stall then dissipates. Good action however this film leaves you hanging. This might make a series if developed further.
1,Surprisingly bad.,"I love the Bourne series, and was SUPER excited to see who was going to be replacing Matt Damon. GREAT casting, TERRIBLE script. It amounts to little more than a (very badass) junkie, looking for a fix. Essentially two hours of ""where can I find these drugs?"" I can see how this was more of a bridge film so that it could break away from Jason Bourne's story, but they did a shoddy job of it, as they broadly reference Jason Bourne in snippets for no real reason. It was an awkward film, and with as much as i love the Bourne franchise, I was surprised at how bored I was."
1,borne away please.,"Why did they have to continue this series? THe first few were ok but it's getting really old that hollywood can't make a movie where spies actually fight people other than americans! zzzzzzzzzzz. Really? with evil terrorists and out of control communist and rogue states out there all we can get is bad americans? Fighting the cia? Actually there may have been no real cia on cia battles ever in history. Or days of the condor. Or whatever. BUt hollywood can't get away from this type of thing. There is a new movie based on real cia people called 'zero dark thirty' coming out at the theaters soon. NOone in the cia tries to kill each other though. how wierd is that? Please avoid this movie so that they will stop making movies where a betrayed agent fights the cia. It's really old and a waste of time. Although the first 2 borne movies were great. But I love movies so I watched this on blu ray and it looked good, the story is bad though."
2,Worst Bourne in the series,"my dad was bored I was bored my mom was bored my brother was bored. it is not the same without Matt Damon, I actually sold this movie right after I watched it, terrible and worthless."
2,what the ?,"lost us right from the beginning, a lot of noise and camera action but didn't hold a candle to previous ""bourne"" movies"
3,Bad sound quality,Sound is too loud then too soft making watching complicated and annoying. Film was pretty good but too long. Acting good!
2,"great trailer, lame movie","Not up to the quality of the original Bourne series and without what made the first movie unique. As a scientist, I can only tolerate so much of biology being butchered for the sake of a movie, but this one pushed it too far, even for gene-therapy applications. Action sequences were ok, but plot was very predictable and characters very 2-dimensional."
4,Enjoyed it !,I thought is was a great movie. Any movie that I do not find myself fast forwarding to get through is a good movie. LOLI enjoyed it !
4,Not a disappointment!,Don't let the fact that Matt Damon isn't in this movie keep you from watching or buying it!. It holds up to its predecessors.
1,Terrible Streaming,"The movie itself was fine, but I had so much trouble with the streaming stopping, Amazons system not working for chunks of time, taking a long time to load, etc that I wasn't even able to finish the movie. I have had numerous problems with Amazon's streaming quality and don't think I will rent an instant video from them again because of it. It is just not worth the hassle."
3,Okay Movie,"I thought the ended was too open ended and did not wrap a lot of loose ends up. Overall though, the movie had a good story and good action."
3,"Awesome show, bad ending",I enjoyed the movie all the way until three end. I couldn't believe it just abruptly ended like that. Kind of disappointing.
3,Not quite as well done as the other Bournes,"As fans of the Bourne series we were anxious to see this film. I love Jeremy Renner and was happy to see him in this. It's action packed for sure, but relatively predictable in many parts. The motorcycle chase scene is far too long and becomes boring."
2,Lame,"Filmography is nothing like the original Bourne films. Worth seeing just to see I guess, but just a little boring."
3,Entertaining enough,I like the bourne movies starring Matt Damon and wasn't really sure what I'd be getting out of the new borne movies. Jeremy Renner did a good job. Good movie to rent.
2,Sony added some new copy protection that prevents these Blu-rays from playing on pc's.,"I just received the Blu-ray 2 disk set yesterday and these are the first Blu-ray disks that will not play on either one of my PC's Blu-ray players. A copy protection notice comes up in my PC's Blu-ray players (Nero Blu-ray player and Cyberlink powerdvd11) and nether disk will play. I finally got it to work on my Panasonic Blu-ray downstairs, I haven't tired the Vizio player yet.I do not plan on purchasing any Sony Blu-ray's in the future! I bought the movie and I should be able to watch it where ever I want. I wasn't aware that Blu-rays can be copied on a PC yet?In any case the movie was different enough to be entertaining but should have been in 3D."
2,Need more story!,"All new people.....why, I need more story! Lots of action....new guy is good, but I was not able to pick up easily the point of this movie."
3,Just ok.,"Good action at times but missed the mark. A little predictable. Stacey Keach was., well... Not the best choice. However if you like the Jason Bourne concept. You won't waste your time but you may experience a let down in particular the ending. See it but know it's only 3 stars."
2,long and not that good,This is a long movie and not very interesting. It lacks the typical spy movie excitement that one would expect
3,Lacks the punch of the previous Bourne movies.,Jeremy Renner does a good job with his character but the whole storyline is lacking the usual Bourne punch. The movie ending sneaks up on you and leaves you trying to comprehend what was the point of the whole picture. The tie-in with the last movie is weak to say the least. Another sequel has to clarify what the heck you just witnessed and where it's headed to from here!!!!!!
3,This Movie stole the title to make lots of money,"Rented this movie on Amazon through our Roku. Quality was great but 5 bucks was a lot for a rental.The movie was somewhat of a continuation of the Bourne Ultimatum but not really. It just seemed like they were trying to finalize the Jason Bourne story but then get the audience to like the ""new guy."" And the ""new guy"" being an upgrade of Jason Bourne. It's a good entertaining rental; wouldn't purchase the movie for myself or friends."
3,"Good, but not as good as the trilogy","Good - a little confusing (more than necessary to make it ""good confusing""), and a little less that I expected from a Bourne movie."
2,Ended to soon,"The movie ended just when it should have started going, just left it open for a new Bourne series, The ending reminded me of the lord of the rings trilogy where the first movie didn't really end. I said then that if I invest 3 hrs to watch a movie, it better end, never watched the others, Will treat the new bourne series the same."
3,Action,"Of course the action in this film was great, but very little to the story. I was not emotionally attached to the characters. Sometimes Hoolywood doesn't get it. Give us a good story and then fill it with action. We are not hybrid droids sitting in a chair staring at your product."
4,The Bourne Legacy,The movie was great. Loved how it ran simultanoeulsy with the Bourne Identity.picture quality and streaming were off though
3,Mediocre,"While Renner does a good job in this installment, the concept is wearing thin and story is a bit stale."
3,Falls Short!,"While Bourne Legacy was not a bad movie, it just isn't in the same catagory as the other Bourne movies. I kept waiting to see ""Jason Bourne"" and some sort of viable link to the new batton holder...Jeremy Renner. It just didn't do it for me. I'm such a ""Jason Bourne"" fan, that nothing less will do. I thought the way the writer tried this movie and the plot to the past Bourne movie was pathetic to say the least. It had so many holes in the tie in that it lost me right off the bat! I only rated this movie a three stars because it had entertainment value, but for a true ""Jason Bourne"" lover, it was disappointing."
4,"Good, but not AS good ...","I love the Bourne series. And Jeremy Renner usually does a great job. However, the change of cast (which does fit the story) took away from what I really liked about the Bourne series. For me I think it was too much of a change in the dialogue ... there was just too much of it and not enough ""Bourne."" Overall, it was good. It's just not what I loved before."
4,The Bourne Legacy,"Good flick. Would like to see more of the ""new"" Bourne Legacy..He really has a tough act to follow, but I am sure he will come through. He sure was tough in this flick. I really would like to see more action movies similar to this in the near future. Go rent, borrow, buy or whatever this movie. It is worth your time."
2,"Please, shut down the Bourne series.",This series needs to be sent to its grave. It reminded me of Predator 2 and how bad it sucked.
4,It was very good,"Lots of action, but somewhat juvenile story line. My kind of movie though.Actor made it work and weapons were pretty awesome on the drone."
2,Not as good as Bourne Series,This movie wasn't up to the task. Confusing story line and poor character development gives this movie only two stars. Rent before buying.
2,Not as good as others,"I was disappointed with this Bourne movie. I like Jeremy Renner and I though the story line was pretty good, just didn't have something the others did."
3,Jumped the shark with the genetic modification of the Outcome agents,Writing wasn't as good as the previous installments of the Bourne series and seemed slower-paced. I was nearly bored stiff during the final chase scene. I still prefer not to think of Outcome and Treadstone agents as magic pill-popping mutants and instead just highly trained (both mentally and physically).
4,Great Follow up for the Bourne Series,"I liked the story and the action was pretty good. I thought it ended too abruptly, but I guess it sets up the next one."
3,Loved the Trilogy,This movie was alright. Lot's of action and similar to the first three. I had some issues with the story-line.
2,Bourne Legacy,This film should not be associated with the bourne films. It seemed as if someone created a script that just had one thing after another happen and then they put bourne in the title..
4,Still good without Matt Damon,"First half hour was a little slow as it was confusing with all the jumping around between various people and situations, but as it started to make sense -it got really good!! Love this series"
4,Action and more action,"I enjoyed this movie mostly because of the action. The plot did not seem well developed, but it was a sequel. I wasn't expecting much plot development.The actors/actresses in it are some of my favorites, so I would have watched it regardless."
3,Renner is a great action actor. Very believable.,"Fairly good action, I was mad that it ended as it did. It almost seems like the director was told "" your film is 2 and 1/4 hours long and it has to end""."
4,Spy mystery,"You really have to pay attention to follow. I didn't think there was as much action as the orginal bourne stories, but it was good. Good sound and picture."
2,Pointless,"Was a lot of action and chasing, but didn't seem to have a real plot line, though was carrying on from the prior films."
3,Not as good as the previous 3.,"The action in this movie is rare, and when it does get to the action it's not as well written as the previous Bournes. I think the biggest mistake this movie has is not keeping Matt Damon in the series. If you've seen the Bourne movies before, you know what it's about so there was no reason for the long talk and explanation in the first half of the movie. Obviously there should of been more action. And what's up with the ending, is it supposed to make you think another Bourne movie will follow? Anyways, when you have a good actor like Matt Damon doing a great job, why throw in a different main actor? I was hoping Jason Bourne was going to finish what he started...What the heck...??? Other then that some action scenes were great, some good acting."
2,worst Bourne movie ever,"Too long, Too confusing. So many sub-plots that in the end you do not care what happens to any of the people. While they started all these sub-plots they finished none of them. This appears to be an attempt to start a new series but failed on all fronts as I only waste my money once."
2,Boring!,"My kids and I are big fans of the original Bourne series. So naturally we were excited about this latest installment. Nope. Very boring. I understand you have to set up the back drop but boring. I will not buy this to put in our collection. Hopefully, the next one will be better."
3,Could be bettter,"Monotonous at the beginning; previous ""Bourne movies"" had more action. I was expecting more from this movie other than a motorcycle chase."
1,Boring,"Story was weak, the movie flowed poorly. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but was sorry it wasn't free, that's all it was worth."
3,"Good movie, but here is the problem.","I enjoyed this movie. I thought the action was fast paced without being overdone. The problem with the movie is, of course, there were 3 others without Aaron Cross. With the many referrals back to Jason Bourne in this version, it was almost like they were asking him to come back.Had I not seen the other three movies, I would have enjoyed this one more.I think if this were the first one of the series or a new movie altogether, it would have had more impact. But alas, with 3 Bourne movies its belt, it was not as good as I had hoped."
3,Did not meet my expectations. Could have been much better,Was just ok. Did not measure up to the films in this series. The actors had no real chemistry and the plot was not very good.
4,Legacy,"I totally enjoyed all of the Bourne series. It was intriguing to say the least. The movie captures the imagination and allows one to visually escape reality, while presenting a theatrical view of a side of life which is interesting but the average person will never be involved in!! Just a real feel good movie which provokes thought!!!"
2,"Little Action, but Copied the Action Scenes that it did have from the past Bournes","This movie was the worst of the Bourne movies by far!! It didn't have much action at all and the ones it did have were copy cats from the past Bourne movies. The scene where he was running on roof tops while the doctor was running from the police has already been done! The car/motorcycle chase immediately following has also been done.The other mistake that was made is that I wasn't bonded with the main character. Unlike Bourne, you didn't know much about Aaron, nor are you invested in him. So, you don't care what happens to him.Poor movie."
3,Not up to the Bourne brand,"While the action sequences are good and the aircraft drone scenes are awesome, they don't save the movie. The acting is ok, but the parts written for the actors didn't leave them a lot to work with. The ideas and themes of the plot have great potential. Maybe the movie just tried to do too much in too little time."
3,Standard Action Flick,This is a step down from the previous Bourne editions. Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon and the story line was very weak. Just an average action flick.
3,Bourne the Fourth?,"good action, credible storyline. being a ""tres"" myself, i avoided the temptation (after two daughters) of naming a son, the FOURTH! oy, i thought better of it. needless to say, we were not blessed with a son. nevertheless, if he had been ""bourne,"" he would have been named John Carlos! time to move on..."
4,bourne,Good action with a connection with previous bourne movies. Not really sure I liked the ending. Will have to watch again.
3,Ok bad ending,This movie was long the action was good the ending left lott to be desired Over all good film. Would tell my friends to watch if bored.
4,Bourne legacy,Great movie love Jeremy Renner in this role will look forward to the next one in the series which is sure to come
2,More of the same,"The plot was derivative of past Bournes. Further, it never grabs you. I never found myself wondering what would happen next. Basically, it lacked any real tension. While it was good that they tried to tie in the previous Bourne plots, they didn't clearly delineate early whether this was a replacement, like Bond, or a new character. I would recommend that you should wait and watch it on free TV."
3,"OK, overall","Not sure he was a good leading in this leading role...the plot was good, and special effects also ok movie"
2,Far cry from the original Bourne series,"I really like Jeremy Renner so I was biased PRO this movie.Unfortunately, the plot makes it impossible for the authentic and likablecast to save the movie. It felt as a haphazard collection of scenes,lacking climat and memorable fragments."
4,not too shabby!,"You get what you came for! Jeremy Renner being a killing machine! I was a bit upset by the time-table the plot divulges, but hey... it's good for what it is.. just another sequel.."
4,"Even without Damon, Bourne series riveting.","I was wary that Bourne Legacy would disappoint and be a disappointing attempt to cash in on the sucesses without the star power expense. Due to high regard for Jeremy Renner's work, I gave it a chance.I was not disappointed. Action to the nth degree. Cogent logical plot. Superb acting. Jeremy Renner will be a top tier male lead for years to come"
4,Good Escapist Entertainment,"Good acting helped get through a somewhat confusing plot during first 20% of the film. Lots of shooting, which didn't sit well after the Connecticut massacre, but that's what this genre offers. Plus a good chase scene on motorcycles. In the end, we found the story and characters enjoyable."
4,Good Movie,This Movie is Good but not Great. It has great scenery and special affects but this is not a Jason Bourne Sequel and to their credit it is not advertised that way if you pay attention.
4,Movie Buff,"It started out slow but as the movie continued it got better. I don't feel that it was as good as the other ""Bourne"" sequels, but it will do. I feel that it would have been better if Matt Daman was in this one. After all, I think he was the one who made the movie. All in all, this sequel was good."
4,Not the orginial but i still love it,great movie for bourne fans. it start off different then the first three but. i cannot wait for the next one to come out.
4,Better than expected,"I thought they did a reasonable job of explaining how there could be another super-assassin; it was a bit forced here and there but not too bad. They wisely gave the character a distinctly different personality than Bourne had. The dialog avoided most of the cliche's you get in movies like this and it was greatly appreciated.I don't have much else to say about it other than I was entertained and didn't notice many cringe-worthy mistakes. The ending was odd though, it just kind of petered out.I am annoyed that they charged a dollar more to rent this than most movies but that doesn't effect the movie's quality."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was, like probably most people, a little worried about how a Bourne movie could possibly work without Jason Bourne in it. However! Be not afraid! It turned out wonderfully. A good addition to the franchise even if it was Matt Damon-less. I was hoping maybe for a cameo but I guess it would have been hard to have him pop up without having to give him a more significant role. I still prefer the original 3 but I would not complain at all if they made more with Jeremy Renner"
1,Bourne Legacy,"Bourne Legacy but NOT Bourne!I just finished watching the latest from the Bourne-franchise and I finished with mixed emotions. Does it have a great cast? Sure! Is the story-line even passable? Absolutely! Is the action well-made? Certainly! Is it high-paced? You bet! Is this a great Action-flick or isn't it? Oh yes!But a Bourne-movie its not. First of all it doesn't ad anything to the Bourne-universe but merely retells the story from the original movie - Bourne Identity - and even worse: How the h... is it ever going to be a Bourne-movie without Jason Bourne? I thought I could see past that, but I can't.In the end I have to conclude: Great Action-flick which unfortunately is missing the essence of Bourne. If you can look past this you are in for a treat. If you can't you will be disappointed. I was!So where does that leave the Bourne-franchise? That remains to be seen! Right now however it looks DEAD. Sorry fans!"
2,Too much Science Fiction for an Action movie,"One of the reasons I like the first 3 Bourne movies was that they were, with a few exceptions, plausible to realistic. The main plot of this movie is built around science fiction (ad-hoc genetic re-engineering). That just ruined it for me and made it too fake to believe."
3,Not an easy transition from Damon to Renner,"Always looked forward to the Bourne movies. Renner spent too much time looking pensive for my tastes. Just didn't enjoy it as much as the past. Too bad too, I think this could've been an American version of a long running James Bond."
3,Just okay,I had to restart this movie several times and still had trouble being interested in it all the way through.
3,Good film... but hard to live up to predecessors,"Expectations were high for me due to the initial movies with Matt Damon. This film needed to at least match the others in intensity and action. Jeremy Renner did a good job and was believable but was saddled with a week story line that made him dependent on substances. Furthermore, the film ended without closure for me. I would like to have seen the bad guys get there due in the end.Good overall, but disappointing."
3,"Not bad, but expected a lot more from the series","I really like Jeremy Renner and the Bourne Series. This fell short for both. I kept waiting for an action sequence that would grab me, but it never came. In fact there weren't that many. The car chase was good, but it felt like that was suppose to be the climax of the film. They left it open to continue the series. Hopefully they can restore the series, but as it's own movie I kept waiting for it to start."
3,Disappointing,"I expected more ... and I was disappointed. The acting was fine, but the storyline left something to be desired."
3,Not up to triology standard,Story line too muddied and flashbacks to the revelations are are inconsistent with earlier versions of the final Bourne story.
2,Poor Editing,"The editing really made the movie hard to follow. Felt like different cuts were stitched together. Not cohesive, disjointed, poor ending."
3,a lot of action,"Jeremy was good, but it is hard to follow the original Bourne. We like movies without the ""F"" word but still full of action."
3,Setup Movie...,"Within the lines of the Bourne movies, I have say it was not the Best... However it was a great setup movie for the next part."
2,Confusing Story,"It started on training day and ended up looking for his antidote, No mission or nothing importantly done. Ended up for the part 2 movie."
4,Bourne for the next generation,"I loved all the Matt Damon Bourne movies, so Jeremy Renner had big shoes to fill in my books. I think this movie was solid and could easily serve as a segue to a new movie franchies with Renner at the helm."
2,Lame Duck,Watching this movie was like eating that second piece of pie and expecting it to taste as good as the first but it doesn't.
2,I want my money back,This Bourne movie is a mistake. Why would you ruin the good franchise with this add-on movie? Just because Jeremy Lenner is casted doesn't mean the movie will be good. Ugh.
3,Not the same,"This series was supposed to get better with each installment, but instead took a step backward when they introduced a new character instead of telling was what happened to the last one."
3,Bourne He's Not,"There was certainly entertainment in this movie, once I got past the confusion of the beginning and figured out the treads to be connected. But more star power was needed to carry off this movie."
3,Bourne series dying?,This was disappointing for the Bourne series. The action was entertaining enough but the plot was weak and poorly done. Many plot lines were never resolved or even returned to after taking up significant screen time.
3,Missing Bourne,"I'd been looking forward to this movie, having been impressed with all of the Bourne films to date, but this one fell flat.It isn't just the fact that Matt Damon wasn't involved in the project - Jeremy Renner, Rachiel Weisz, Ed Norton, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney for a brief shining moment - these are some of my favorite people. But the script limped along from the start and by the time it started to pick up the movie was over."
3,Plot lacked substance,There was a lot of action and there were parts that were good however the plot wasn't put together well. It also left me hanging at the end like what happened to main character and the woman.
3,Not great,"Sometimes ok action punctuates long stretches of tedious dialogue. The climatic chase, motorbikes in Manila, is underwhelming - the über-assassin opponent is not too impressive. Thankfully the action is not ruined by the stupid-shaky-cam of the previous Bournes. A harrowing workplace shooting - the helpless, unarmed victims all menaced by a single gunman - makes a good case for ubiquitous arms in the office."
3,Good movie,It was a good movie. I enjoyed it but I would not rate it as one of my favorites. The ending was different.
1,"Extremely disappointing, not fulfilling","Flat. No character or plot development. Just chase scene after chase scene - and very predictable. Main character needs something to survive, they get it while being chased, technology wizardry, couple happily together in the middle of nowhere."
5,It Kept That Special Magic Even With Jeremy Renner,"Jeremy Renner was excellent!!! The producers were correct to change the actor for that role, and what a great young actor they selected. Great movie, Great Cast and Great everyone."
2,"I think they forgot something. . .oh yeah, it's called a plot","The movie spends way too much time trying to link itself to the other Bourne movies. That link is very thin, and could have been explained in a simple fashion with about 3 lines of dialogue. Instead, they make oblique references to Jason Bourne and the Treadstone project and fill the screen with cameos of actors from the first films. That time would have been far better spent developing a plot for Jeremy Renner's character--or at least clarifying the scant plot they had. Too confusing, with too many characters that you never get to know enough to like or hate."
3,More more Men.,"What can I say. I like a good action packed kill'em movie, but this was no-where as good as the original Bourne movies. Should have gone a diff direction when they made this."
4,worth watching,A good action movie. A bit hard to follow with all the flashbacks. Helps if you have a rough idea of the story before watching.We experienced problems with the sound consistency.
2,Confusing,"Throughout the whole movie I was feeling as if I was waiting for it to start.... Well at least the action for it to start.... I did not understand what enas going on, or the hung with that pills till I think way later in the film.. shame"
4,Intense,"Certainly held my interest throughout. Acting was good, I thought, and I really like the main actors. If one hadn't seen the previous Bourne movies, you might miss a little something but it would still be a good movie to watch. The ending kind of left me wanting for more. Hmm......."
4,Great until the end,"I really enjoyed this movie and the fact that it expanded on the Treadstone story line, while introducing new characters. I was all set to give it 5 stars until the very end when it was left rather open-ended and clearly inviting another sequel to be made. Still a great movie and well-enjoyed by men and women alike. But I wish that the movie had been more self contained with the bad government guys getting what's coming to them in the end. Guess I'll have to wait for the sequel."
2,ho hum,"same old story. Now with medications. Good diversion, but easy to forget. No good hand to hand combat that was in the other ones."
4,Good movie,Although not as good as the original the action was well done. I do think reusing and intertwining the previous movies footage in this one sort of lessened the impact ( you really had to understand and keep up with the plot in the previous movies).This one did not meet the intellectual standards set before.
4,Matt who?,One would think that the same plot line would get tired after 4 tries but not here. Matt Damon wasn't missed as Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz were a great combo and the action was non stop. Good watch!
2,Not the crown jewel of the Bourne anthology,"To give it some bonus points, the Bourne Legacy had some very successful action sequences. But that's about all. Jeremy Renner was unconvincing, and Rachel Weis was just as forced. Edward Norton tried to make the most of his contribution to the film, but with a story line as contrived and hard to follow as the Bourne Legacy was, he couldn't lift this film out of its poorly thought out plot. It is an unfortunate follow up to a fairly successful trilogy of entertaining films."
3,The Boured Legacy,With a predictable plot and a sappy ending this addition to the Bourne series was rather disappointing. The writers and directors just didn't give Jeremy Renner much to work with.
3,Not as good as the other Bourne movies,I really wanted to love it since I really like the lead actor but I have to say that it didn't come close to the other Bourne movies. Not worth the extra $1 you charged in comparison to the $3.99 rental fee on everything else. Wait till the price lowers to rent it.
4,just as good as the other ones,They found a way to continue the series while changing our main character. I compare them to the series of James Bond films..where there is a new actor playing our hero every 3 film's with no explanation as to how or why this happened. The Bourne series is about our own government making kill squads and the politics and actions of covering them up when they go south. excellent series.
1,Why Do Movie Writers Think They Are Smarter Than Novel Writers?,"Pro: Awesome Alberta posing as Alaska winter scenery.Con: Everything else about this derivative, pointless rip-off.The only thing ""Bourne"" about this movie is the promoter's desire to ride Ludlum's coat tails. Yes, I know, the Bourne movie trilogy wasn't true to the original novels, but at least it had some resemblance to the story line. The 4th ""reboot"" is something else, and that something is no part of Ludlum's Legacy."
3,I was getting sea-sick from the cinematogrophy,"Interesting plot but the close quarters, fast-cuts just wore me out. I would have enjoyed more had they kept the camera still and made the cuts twice as long. Hard to tell who/what/where when the cuts were so fast."
3,"Great, until the end.","The end felt like it ended in the middle of the story. It needed at least 20 more minutes to conclude the movie. I hate non endings, and this movie takes the cake."
3,Good movie until the end,"i would have given it a 4-star rating but for the end, which was mediocre. i think bourne ultimatum was the best so far..."
3,The Beginning,"This is a very slow moving plot involved film, it does have some good action but sadly it is over just as it starts moving. This is obviously only the introduction to what we can believe several other ""Bourne"" movies. It was a big let down, wait til it comes on TV then watch."
4,Great movie,Need to watch the other Bourne movies before watching this one. It references them quite often though out the movie. But great action and fantastic continuation of the story!
5,good entertainment,"This movie does a good job of blending in with the other Bourne series, and leaves the door open for more."
4,"Good movie, even without Damon","Even without Damon, this is still a good movie. I have always liked the series and would recommend the movie."
1,roku hd,Movie kept stopping. Didn't get to enjoy the movie. Wish it would have been better. Don't know if I will keep my prime account. Hope other movies will work.
2,Not good,Can't compare to the first Three. All action and no story. Would not watch this movie again if it was free!
2,"Bourne Legacy...eh, it's a rental","The movie started off slow, which I understand because they were developing the characters; however, as soon as the movie started to pick up pace and get interesting...it ends. It's like watching a TV show and plot starts to unfold and then all of sudden it ends with saying ""tune in next week for the dramatic conclusion!"" The movie felt unfinished and the movie as a whole was not strong to begin with to have an ending like this movie had.The ""Bourne Identity"" introduced and developed characters, but movie ended very well, you knew there was going to be sequel, but at the same time you felt good about the conclusion of the first movie.Overall this movie is 2 star and worth rental, but definitely not worth buying on DVD or Blu-ray."
2,what was the point?,"Was the point here just to add an installment to the ""Bourne"" movies? I didn't get the sense that they were doing a switch of main characters, or anything really. At the end I was surprised it was over and was just left wondering what the heck the point of the movie was. It was decent action and could entertain for a few hours, but I don't think it comes close to as good as the previous films."
2,Nothing Like the Book which would have been fine if it would have been good,"This was simply not interesting at all. I won't give any spoilers, but I can tell you if you are a Bourne fan from the Ludlem days and then with the new series, this just did not cut it. This had nothing to do with the book or Bourne. The Bourne Legacy book was still all about Bourne, but this movie had nothing to do with him."
2,Does not live up series,"Like many series of movies, some gain strength and some lose the momentum...in my opinion the Bourne series has been fading and this last installment is at the bottom...I hope this was the last."
2,Wow that was not good,Wow what a let down.Good premise but it just never came together.The acting was pretty good but the story just laid there waiting to be revived.
1,Waste of...everything,"Looks like a Legacy is not a good thing to leave after all, just another Hollywood lazy attempt to extort money and provide nothing in return."
2,worst of all the Bourne movies,"The fact that they had to use the ""pills"" to enhance the subjects was lame. Other than that thought the movie was ok until the ending which sunk it for me. How do you activate the guy from the Larx program and the don't even have a badass fight? The girl kicked him off his motorcycle! Really?!? Disappointed!"
1,You have to be kidding !!!,"That was was the worst movie of the year, nothing at all of the first three a joke and then I paid 4.99 on top of it. Very boring and I had rented with family over too it shouldn't even be put into the category of action, it was about being dependent on pills seems the only way they need to live,"
1,Bourne fans....don't waste your money,I saw this movie in the theaters and refuse to add it to my collection. This is the worst movie of the 4. The story appears to only be a bridge to launch the new character....and that bridge is poorly built.Suggestion...wait for the movie to show up on USA Network in a few months.
2,Z Z Z Z Z,"I'll be generous and give it 2 stars, mainly for some great senic shots. The movie plods along with references to Treadstone and other previous Bourne movie anchor points. There is a wild motorcycle chase sequence at the end but by that time I was already playing around with my Kindle, having lost interest somewhat earlier. Jeremy Renner is not remotely believeable, too bad an actor couldn't have been hired for that part. I admire Edward Norton greatly but his talents are wasted in this one. Casting him as an upper level CIA boss doen't fly. Wait for Red Box availability on this one, that way you'll only waste a dollar."
2,Lame,The movie was a huge let down. Thought it was going to better. Not worth the $5 I paid to rent it...
2,Passable,The thing that I got the most of this movie is that Manila is a mess. Other than that the obvious linkage to the Bourne saga is limp at best.
2,Not Matt Damon,"Jeremy Renner did a decent job but except for a few scenes I kept expecting the action to get better but no cigar. Look you either have a suspenseful movie where you the viewer are trying to figure out what going to happen or you have action or better yet a mix of both. Sadly, this movie was flat and very easy to predict. Good acting, bad plot, and even worse bad direction. Wait for it on cable."
4,Nice variation on the franchise,"Movie is during the same timeframe as the last Bourne so its has some continuity with the previous storylines. Plenty of action with evil CIA and government types. As with most action movies, i doubt anyone; drug enhanced or not would make through the first reel without a trip to the morgue. Suspend logic and enjoy."
4,Good movie,"This was a gift for my son. We watched it together. It was good. The action was there, the girl was there, if there was no previous Bourne movies it would have been great, but there were previous Bourne movies. This was not the best Bourne movie."
2,"LOVE Jeremy Renner, but film is bad","It ended. That's it. But it couldn't be over, could it?? I sat staring at the screen, seeing that there were only a few minutes left, and I thought, ""Please let something MAJOR happen now"". And it didn't.Jeremy Renner is perfect for this role. He's believable, maybe even more so that Damon. I loved watching HIM. I didn't like the story line (if there was one). I hope Jeremy continues this role, but I hope that everyone else associated with making this movie are asked to step aside.I can't believe it ended the way it did. How did this movie get approved for release?? Didn't ANYONE view it before sending it out to the theaters? So sad that such great potential was crumpled up and thrown away, leaving a very talented actor to sit around and look foolish for picking this role."
4,Some neat twists,I'm giving it a four instead of a 5 only because so many of my questions about the Bourne Legacy were still left unanswered. Guess they will make another sequel... Had a lot of good action and was very interesting to watch. My husband likes these action movies and I enjoyed this one too as it had more than just action... but some drama as well.
4,This movie was good,I really liked this movie. It was fast paced and a good addition to the Bourne series. Much better than I expected.
2,Disappointing film can't hold candle to the other Bourne movies.,"I saw this movie on a plane for free, and I still paid too much. Save yourself the $5 and more importantly save your time. The other Bourne movies are significantly better than this one in plot, acting, and high-flying spy thriller action."
3,Eh....,"Good try, but didn't hit the mark. I completely understand why they made this movie and was really hoping it's surprise me. It didn't. I found it predictable and occasionally boring. Too bad they burned down that gorgeous old house...bummer."
3,"At least for me okay, not one of their best",My hubby is a BOURNE freak and we have watched every single movie. It's just not the same without Matt Damon and the story line was okay but REALLY SLOW to get to the point. There was alot more action in the other movies than this one. Even my husband said it was okay. And just when you think it is starting to get somewhere the movie ends!
3,Decent flick,I liked the original 3 much better. The newest one bordered on sci-fi more than just an action flick. Renner was good in the role though.
2,Nowhere near as good as the other Bourne movies,"I guess when the main actor on a film series doesn't appear in the film, that's a clue the movie isn't going to be as good. I have no idea if this movie was done by the same director, but the movie didn't feel like a Bourne movie at all. Aside from a similar premise, the pacing and action were very different. As a $1 redbox rental I still wouldn't have been overly happy with it. As a $5.99 Amazon Video Rental I'm very unhappy.I should say, the quality of the video served by Amazon was superb. It's Hollywood I'm unhappy with, not Amazon."
3,It's Not Jason,If I didn't see the other Bourne movies I would probably rate it a little higher but the bar has been set. His acting is nowhere the level that he displayed in The Hurt Locker and The Town but we all need an easy payday I guess.
3,It was more of an afterthought,"This one was nothing like the other Bourne movies, and was less than satisfying. I suppose that they did it this way to set up another sequel, and I will go see that one, especially if Jason Bourne is the main character. Overall, not a great movie."
4,Bourne carries on,Good movie felt ending left more questions than answers I sense sequel. I do like Jeremy Renner in this role.
5,This extends the Bourne franchise predictably and pleasurably!,"Loved all previous movies ... loved this too! If you have watched and own the others, this is a must!"
3,Not as good as the first three,"There is a lot of action, but just not as good overal than the previous ones, especially the first one."
2,No Direction,"Aaron Cross did not have the same moral compass as Jason Bourne - Jason would fight people and let those that were incidental to his real issues survive. Think of the Russian police that he left alone. Aaron, in contrast, basically killed everyone in his path. Think of the Filipino guards. Finally, Aaron's motives were selfish - he was desperate to get meds so he would not become stupid again. In contrast, Jason was trying to figure out, and rectify, his past. That is much more morally compelling.Very much an action movie, but left me empty inside at the end."
2,disappointed,"Meh.Gives a bad name to the others in the series. Too long, comic book plot. Regardless, I still wont see the Hobbit."
2,Boring,Same old! minus Jason Bourne. There was nothing new to the story line and neither to the character. Interspersed with references to Bourne to find some legitimacy to fit with the franchise...
4,HARD TO LET GO OF MATT DAMON BUT...,"After going through three of the Bourne Legacy movies with Matt Damon, I admit it was difficult to let go of that but, still, this one clearly delivered on its own, providing ample story and action in line with the prior Bourne movies. I sincerely hope they continue on with this, utilizing the same characters in place."
2,Retread,"Not very interesting, nothing new. Yawn! Seems like a money grab like so many sequels or prequels. Save your time and money.I would give it a barely watchable."
2,this was not a movie worth making.,its a bad movie. slow...messy story that doesnt seem to be going anywhere. hope you dont make a follow up to this mess
2,Bourne to end,"Another Movie that disappoints... This is the second movie that I watched this week that has left me waiting for an ending.... Good action. But come on the newest version GMH ""Genetically Modified Human"" Died far to easily and quickly.. Signed: Again Disappointed"
4,Will complete the set,"This will complete my collection ,It will have to wait for the next family night,jsut needs to be a little colder"
5,Best Bourne Yet!,"Personally, I don't care for Matt Damon's acting it leaves a lot to be desired. However, when Jeremy Renner stepped into the role I certainly wanted to see where the trilogy plus was going. This is a great movie, with good consistent story line and some really amazing action stunts. So for those out there, who enjoy the rogue agent and enemy of the state movies, this is it! Definitely worth the watch and keeping."
3,It was okay.,"It had a star studded cast- Weisz, Norton, Renner, and that scary looking asian guy- oh la la! Yet it didn't deliver. It's what someone said, this movie only needed a good director. Too bad. I really like Jeremy."
4,The Bourne Legacy,Overall I would give this movie two thumbs up. My only issue is the story is a bit slow and disjointed for the first maybe 30 minutes. The action scenes are great with some great back drops. I personally see this movie as a build up to continue the series using the Aaron Cross character giving him a foot hold into the series and introduction. With the ending so wide open a follow up is in the works.
3,Driven by a single actor ...,"If not for Renner in this movie I would have lost interest early on. Story line created strictly for the sake of the action, and not a very good story line."
4,Good action film,Watched this movie while setting at an airport. Kept us entertained not to mention made the long delay more tolerable. being able to watch movies this way is incredible.
2,Not as good,"I was not impressed. Makes the first 3 shine even brighter. Watch it though - movies are one of those things. I didn't like it, but you may."
2,"Great action but ""same old"" story","I am a big fan of the first two Bourne movies.This movie has great chase-action.But, the story is old and, now, boring.Without revealing the events, here is the story:A government official decides to close a secret program.To accomplish this, he has to kill its agent."
3,too predictable,"I was mostly bored watching this movie, I felt it was just too predictable, the plot too light, it had potential to be better but apparently the writers decided to just do the minimal they could get by with."
3,Not as much fun as the other Bourne movies,"It's just kinda boring. Mr. Renner does a nice job, but the movie sorta drags. The plot needed to be more involved and surprising. It's not a bad movie though."
4,Good Film,"Fast moving and interesting plot! It took a while to get used to Jeremy Renner, but as time went on, he fit the role."
4,Always cool Bourne movies,"It is only under extreme circumstances that I will pay this amount to 'buy' the movie. It would have been an instant sell as a 'rent' movie and would have appealed to a broader band of customers. Personally, I'll stop using Amazon movies if they continue to only offer 'buy' options.If it was a 'rent' movie, I would have given it 5 stars. Who doesn't love a Bourne movie (except, of course, my wife)?"
4,"Does justice to the Bourne movies, we enjoyed it!","The move starts well, gets you wondering what is going on. Maybe a 1/3 of the movie leaves you wanting more action, however it delivers towards the end. Opens up a whole new chapter to these stories."
1,a bunch of unrelated chase sceens,"No plot. Just chases. Very little relation to prior plot lines. New elements added that had no relation to prior story, but were intended to."
2,rip off,rip off of the original moviespoorly written script as well.good acting but not story to justifyit doesn't make sense to kill off all of the highly trained people
2,rehash,"This was i thought going to be a little better than a Hangover 2 type re-telling of the same story, I mean it had a few different asspects but as a whole left me wanting for at least a Reboot of this franchise which i liked the other movies this they should have went do we need to make more money of a name, the answer should have been NO."
1,Hopefully the last,does not measure up to the original. they'll do anything to make a buck. apparently amazon doesn't understand the need for brevity.
4,Keeping in the story line of the jason bourne trilogy,"This delves deeper into the thinking of treadstone, the science behind it. Turns out Jason Bourne was not alone out there.Also the science was not able to overcome the humanity of their agents.this is for anyone who loves the 007, and MI type action movies.you get a sense of Jason Bourne's second movie when Jeremy Renner protects his gal. but only slightly.I would give 5 stars if it never ended. Loved It - can't wait for the next one.Mike S."
4,Jeremy Did a good job............ HOWEVER,...........the whole movie you are waiting for some seriously crazy stuff. Left me limp....until the last 45 mins of the movie. So if you have nothing to do...... phase in and out...and then wake up for the ending!enjoy!
2,Slow and Unesscessary,"The movie was a bit slow going with no real action scenes that I have come to expect from the Bourne Series. Since I enjoyed the first three I thought this would be of the same caliber. While it does explain the science and maybe ties the first three Bourne movies together, it was rather unnecessary and only real purpose was to bank on the success of the Bourne franchise. I really wish I would have rented this instead of buying it."
3,the pills,I don't remember Bourne taking any pills in the other movies or having to come in every so often to get new ones so for that reason I found this movie disconcerting. the only thing that saved it was the beautiful scenery.
2,The Film was great..however the streaming quality was at times pixilated. I would have otherwise ordered it elsewhere.,I would like to request a refund from Amazon Instant video.This isn't the first time this has occurred with a streaming movie I have ordered with Amazon.Hopefully they'll straighten it out.
3,A movie with no ending,"So very much like all the other Bourne movies in action and pace but with no closure at the end. Like cutting someone's sentence off midword. The worst of the Bourne movies for that fact alone. All they did was escape.I'm very glad I waited for this to be available as a rental. Was not happy at the extra $1 though. No rental on Amazon should be more than $4, but still glad I didn't buy it for $15. This is not a movie I want to watch again.Amazon seems to be pressing us more and more to buy movies when they're released. This one was out for more than a week only to buy before a rental was offered at an inflated price.I'd like to see a little more loyalty from Amazon to its customers to keep the products reasonably priced and available in the format we want."
3,"it's okay, if you're not expecting a true sequel to Supremacy","I think this movie in no way lives up to the Bourne trilogy as a follow up. It also for me doesn't really start to cook until halfway through, whereas the original Bourne films always engaged me from the very start. However, I have a huge crush on Jeremy Renner and am a huge fan of Rachel Weiz. If you look at it as a stand-alone film, it's entertaining and fun, especially as I said in the 2nd half, but it's nowhere up to the edginess of Bourne and really has more of a science fiction twist which takes it completely in a different direction. I liked the characters, but the pacing just didn't cut it, the ""suspension of disbelief"" wasn't really there, and some the chases seemed really canned, like watching a Bourne rerun. The efforts to tie it in to the original trilogy seemed forced and again, the flow just wasn't there. I gave it three stars. I just watched the entire Bourne trilogy last night on bluray so I have it very fresh in my mind."
5,Edge of your seat excitement,"What a fun movie to escape into. I just love to completely leave reality and get into a non stop action flick. I recommend this, it is fun!"
3,The Bourne Legacy,"Not bad. More or less same plot as the other three, but still manages to be reasonably entertaining. Worth a $3.99 rental."
3,A good Start,"There are lots of similarities to the first trilogy, a sort of repetition or in a way Aaron has inherited what Jason left hanging. The plot was good and the acting was interesting, well performed by a very attractive Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner. I only hope it does not turn into a big screen soap opera coming to haunt us with cheap plots and cliche scenes. I hope that in one of the next episodes the two super secret agents team together and dismantle this insane organization once and forever. I recommend? Yes I do recommend... I saw it twice in a row myself, so go ahead and enjoy."
3,It's OK,Exactly what 3 stars represent: it's ok. It definitely isn't the Bourne Identity Trilogy that I grew to love. Yet it's a good one-timer movie (in my opinion).
2,Pointless,This movie only made me appreciate the original series more. There was absolutely no point to this story. Just terrible.
2,Call it something else - but it has nearly nothing to do with the Bourne series,Tried to like this - just couldn't make it work. Not even enough action for an action movie. Perhaps others will find it more interesting than I did?
2,Disappointing for a Bourne Movie,"Overall the movie lacked a decent plot at the end, you were left saying, ""is that it, it that the whole movie?"".... For a Bourne movie, very disappointing, and not what you've come to expect."
3,Good but dissappointing in some respects.,Doesn't match or compare to the other Bourne movies; however it is entertaining. The movie seemed a bit disjointed at times--or maybe I just miss Matt Damon (could be). Movie is good but not outstanding like the others.
4,Another great Bourne flick.,Great action and Jeremy Renner is a natural at picking up where Matt Damon left off. What you expect from the Bourne franchise.
4,The new Bourne might actually be better!,"Very well done film. Great action scenes, believable for the most part. Quality acting and good character development. I will take Bourne series of 007 all day."
2,Enough with the shaking cameras already!,"The movie is ruined by its overboard use of hand cameras being constantly shaken to produce some sort of tension to the film. Its an effective move you can use IF YOU DO NOT OVERUSE IT. The Bourne movies are best example of the worst level of overuse. Rendering amazing and what must have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in choreography, rehearsed action, stunts and special effects almost UNWATCHABLE. It upsets me that something like this would ruin a movie for me. Again I am not saying this tactic is all together bad but should be more subtle and controlled rather than being blatant and obnoxious. I'm not exaggerating when I say Cloverfield had better camera control."
3,This hurt me,"I don't think this lived up to the quality of the rest of the franchise. The whole movie was just a kind of reset for the characters. It was good compared with your average popcorn chomper, but it didn't compare well with the other Bourne movies. Maybe the next one will make it worth it."
3,OK,"It was ok. It was not what I expected. Good action, but the story line was less than it could have been."
2,Terrible,"There are so many things wrong with this movie and few things right. First of all the science behind the genetic manipulation and the ""magic"" potions to maintain the newly enhanced mental and physical abilities of this pseudo Jason Bourne is pure hogwash. This movie is not about Jason Bourne but a ""new, improved"" genetically enhanced successor to Jason Bourne who must fight an even ""newer"" model to the death. What is this Superman light or perhaps Spartacus light? The action sequences will keep your attention, so that gets the movie 2 stars. The ending is very anemic and cries out, ""We will make another lousy sequel.""If you see this movie, please get paid to see it. Even a free DVD is not worth it."
1,No plot ...,The only enjoyable part of this movie was some of the scenery. There was no plot. I would give it zero stars if that was an option. Don't waste your time!!!
4,Good...,"But not as good as the rest of the series. I like the action scenes, but the acting was as you would expect. OK."
3,So So,"I was a little slow getting started, but it got better as it went along. I really didn't like the ending much. The other Bourne movies were much better."
3,Enjoyable,"This is a predictable film but enjoyable. Lots of action which keeps you entertained. I would recommend this movie to someone who is looking for an action film. However, this is not a Robert Ludlum story which is the reason why I gave it three stars. It just doesn't have that Robert Ludlum spy plot that keeps you in suspense."
4,Good but not great,"Got two DVDs of the movie for Christmas. It's a good movie for relaxing. However, it often felt like watching a high school play. The movie ended on a bland note. It did not have the spark that the earlier versions have. I'd give it a three or four, not bad but not great."
3,Bourne Legacy,Plot & seen semms slow but I kinda understand where they are going with introducing a new character. Let's face it Matt Damon was born to play this role. All in all nice attempt but...
5,The Legacy continues!,"I confess I am addicted to this series of movies, but this one is quite different as it delves into the science behind the agents in the 'Program'. Don't expect Jeremy Renner to replace Matt Damon, as this is not the intent. Renner is quite a good actor in his own right, and has risen in the ranks of action stars recently, most notably as 'Hawkeye' in the Avengers. The Bourne Legacy starts slow, but picks up tempo quite quickly as it intertwines with the plot of the Bourne Ultimatum. There is a great supporting cast including Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz. The car chase is replaced by motorcycles, but in all a great follow up to the previous three movies. If you liked them, this will not disappoint."
4,Worthy Successor to the Bourne Series,I was dubious as to whether a new Bourne character would equal a good Bourne movie but Jeremy Renner knocks it out of the park!
3,Good but not good enough.,I saw all three Bourne movies and I was anxious to see if this one would create a new exciting series.Bzzz...wrong.While passable this film just doesn't live up to the brilliance of the originals.Decent acting.Decent direction.Decent everything just not exceptional.At over two hours it was way too long and could have been trimmed by a good 45 minutes.I wasn't impressed.Please bring back Damon or let the franchise rest.
3,Bourne Legacy,"This movie started out a little slow in my opinion, but definitely picked up the pace about 20-30 minutes in. In my opinion, the storyline had changed enough that it lacked some of the punch of the trilogy centered around Jason Bourne rather than Aaron Cross. Other members of my family absolutely loved it, so take my review with a grain of salt, of course."
4,Surprisingly Good,I had not planned on seeing this movie since I am really a die hard Jason Bourne fan. But although this movie had a slow start it accelerated into the action expected from this movie series.
3,No Bourne Movie,"It had most of the elements, but the timeline was hard to follow. The ""flashbacks"" were not obvious. The tie in to the Bourne series was not obvious (or was just lip service). Good action. A few good chases. At least one good fight. RedBox has it for $1. Cost more on Amazon, but you don't have to leave the house to get it or return it."
5,great,"good movie, hope another one comes out with both stars matt and jeremy renner. would make a great addition to the sreies"
3,it was ok.,The action was great but the plot was loose. The story just didn't hold the same appeal our intrigue that the first three did.
3,Not the best of Bourne,"nice action, but the story needs more depth, the ending didn't leave much conclusion or hints for a next film."
3,Did not live up to the first three,"This movie was not bad, but the story line, character development, and action sequences did not live up to the original movies"
3,It isn't as good as......,It was entertaining but a weaker script than others. It views like a gigantic trailer for future franchise. I liked it just not as much as i wanted to.
4,awesome,"The plot was interesting, so much action. The ending wasn't that good I didn't realize the movie was over. I would watch it again."
4,The Bourne Legacy,Interesting presentation of the agency activity during and after the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs. A bit confusing by interspersing scenes from former movies in a disjointed manner. Not truly enough backround to be relevant. Hard to accept the new character after 3 Bourne films with Damon. Another film would be interesting to consider what direction they can take with the plot given the burn down of the current program.
4,clever good off-shoot of the original,"The movie is pretty well done, if you like Bourne movies this is on par with the first Damon movies."
4,Good Movie,No complaints about the movie itself but it took about an hour to download it. It got stuck at 9% and I had to actually shut my DVR down and restart it to get the movie to download completely.
5,Great Movie,This movie was excellent (in my opinion) and I was on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie. This will make a great gift for anyone who enjoys the borne series
2,Lame,"The plot was borderline incomprehensible even for a movie where the plot is of secondary interest. The need to cash in on previous Bourne movies made the whole experience rather cheesy, and interesting ideas about genetic engineering were lost in the shuffle. Abrupt ending, and a waste of good talent from Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Ed Norton. Renner and Wiesz had little chemistry, a likely outcome of the questionable film making. Fairly pointless character development just to have an action sequence or explosion. Rent Skyfall when it's available on Amazon; now there's good espionage and conspiracy and good action."
3,A slow action film?,"Dang it. I hate when that happens. I was about to throw something at the screen. I really like Jeremy Renner and he does a different Bourne lead. This guy has a sense of humor and that threw me after three stone-faced Jason Bourne flicks. It felt like somebody nervously stepped on my toes during our first dance. Forgiveable, but a second dance? Probably not.Don't pay more than a dollar at Redbox."
2,Bourne Horrible,"A very simple and unexciting main plot. Then to the excitement – a bad guy after good guy chase. The extraordinary chase go on for quite some time on foot, car, motorcycle, etc. Someone who timed this unbelievable chase told me it took 1 hour and 48 minutes of this 2 hour and 16 minute movie. (Much longer and not as good as the French Connection.) I am not sure because I fell asleep during it. The other Bourne movies are great; this is not."
4,A respectable try at rebooting,"I'm sure most people already know, but Jeremy Renner is NOT playing Jason Bourne. This is not a typical reboot, but more of a story-continuing character reboot. Set after the events of the Matt Damon movies, Renner's character is a product of a similar government experiment at creating perfect soldiers that doesn't go exactly as planned. Glorious shoot-outs and butt kicking ensue. An enjoyable watch."
4,Good addition to Bourne Movies,"Action packed very interesting plot, kept my interest until the end. Enjoyed the movie. Look forward to the next one."
5,Appreciating --The Bourne Legacy,The suspense and action were appealing. I have seen the other Bourne movies but I found this one with another agent just as exciting and I would recommend it. Would love to see a sequel with both agents and see what Paula Landy would do with them!
2,So So Bourne,"None of the crispness of the earlier movies. Damon was a much better Bourne. A very ho hum movie, saad that I spent the money."
2,Bourne without Matt Damon is not Bourne,"Nice attempt to reproduce a Bourne movie. However, without Matt Damon is a failure. The movie end is open, makes me think there will be a following.If you don't want to be boring (since would be the 5th) is better to have Matt Damon in it and a good story."
5,Excellent movie,I thought they did a great job of tying the last movie to this one. I would recommend this flick to most viewing groups.
3,Mediocre Bourne Repeat,"Repeat of same storyline with different actors, not quite boring, but not sure I can recommend in good faith. Mediocre at best."
2,Like fast and the furious,"This movie is a 45 minute motorcycle chase. It has nothing to do with the prior ""Bourne"" movies. It was a waste of time"
3,Ok. Not great.,"It was a good action movie, but left a lot of questions up in the air. It is unlike the other Bourne's so don't get your hopes up."
2,let's hope this is one legacy that is finally over,"ack...had high hopes for this one, but was disappointed...cardboard acting and a plot that kept taking sharp left and right turns made this movie difficult to sit through...let's just say we didn't bother hitting 'pause' when needing a snack or bathroom break..."
3,bourne was better with matt damon,"boring , perdictable action scene. jeremy renner is ok but the can not replace matt damon. i give it 3 stars for renting it but dont waste your money to see it in big screen."
3,Should have ended with Supremacy,Didnt live up to the other 3 excellent movies. Should have ended at a trilogy while it was great. This felt like hollywood trying (and failing) to capitalize on past success without a lot of effort.
3,"Fun, Not Revolutionary","This is what I was hoping for at a minimum out of a non-Damon Bourne flick. It was enjoyable with good action sequences. The storyline wasn't quite as well put together as prior Bourne movies, but the acting from Renner helped (mind you, it wasn't something to write home about). Altogether, my girlfriend and I both enjoyed it. But, it's a 3 star, not a 5 star Bourne."
3,It's Just okay.,"The action was great. I was disappointed that he didn't go after the bleep who targetted him. Also, some of the principle goons were killed by Jason Bourne in the previous movie (I thought)."
2,Potential for so much more,"I hope the sequel, if there is one, will be better. I'm a Bourne fan, and this fell flat. So much potential...I hope it was setting the stage because all of a sudden, it was over."
3,Starts strong but....,"They took a big leap to go from Bourne ultimatum to supremacy and an even bigger one to get to this one. The first half of the movie lays the story, however unplausable, and descends into one big chase scene. So worth the rent if a fan but feel sorry for those that paid theater prices."
3,nothing special,"some great moments, nice camera work and great locations. not as action packed as the first 3. maybe they will inprove it next movie. They have the right actor, just need a better script."
2,Disappointing,Boo! This is just chase scenes. No content at all. Very disappointing. Not a good move for the Bourne Franchise.
3,lots of action,not Jason Bourne.. obscure plot line.. like a Bond chase ....did not really like part played by the female actress..
3,Confusing and no point,This is a sequel that references the previous movies significantly as it happens in parallel. Even those who've seen all the Bourne movies will be utterly confused through most of it and disappointed when they realize there is very little plot or purpose to this movie. The action was good and entertaining but overall adissapointment to the franchise.
3,Identity thief,"This film was just an Ok action film, not much different than any other in that genre. Nice chase scenes but nothing new."
3,Not as good as the previous 3,They changed the formula and not for the better.I still don't understand the movie's premise and I'm willing to bet that the director doesn't either.
3,action movie,at first peak the movie tries to make the connection between the Borne series and after a while it tries to imitate the Borne Legacy. the movie as such takes a while before connecting to the viewers. 3/4 into the movie and after having watch the borne legacy does it make sense. then the movie becomes similar to the first borne movie and uses similar - government versus leading couples quest of hide and seek. the chase scene is a bit long. and the end does not correlate with the whole idea of omnipotent government.
1,Bourne Movie,Horrible movie. Could not stand to watch it. A waste of 6$ Deleted it after 15 minutes.Don't bother renting it. A total waste.
2,really bad...,"Confusing, chase, blow something up, chase, zzzz. What a sad legacy to the Bourne movies. And the ending is really stupid. Go buy the trilogy instead."
2,Disappointed,I think I was expecting The Bourne Legacy to be like the other sequels but was soon disappoint and mad at the end of the movie so I am lead to believe there is another sequel.
5,Great Movie : Great Buy,Of course it arrived in excellent condition... Good movie. Not QUITE as good as the others in the Bourne series- but worth watching!
2,Obviously a prequel,"The industry seems to generate stuff like this to keep a franchise going. The plot is unresolved and there is no significant chemistry between the romantic leads. My guess is, Matt Damon refused to sign on for a worn-out concept so they introduced a (flimsily) related character to keep whipping the dead horse."
2,it just didn't live up to the legacy,This movie was nothing more than a bad copy of the original series. The action was dull and the drama and mystery surrounding the main character was absent. They didn't even try to maintain any level of intrigue; they laid it all out for you each step of the way. What made the original series so good was the fact that you were following Jason Bourne on an intense journey to find out who he really was. Nothing about this movie seemed original and it completely lacked any intensity. I was bored by the time the big cookie cutter chase scene occurred. If the movie were titled anything else I would probably give it 3 stars since it was watchable but it just didn't live up to the legacy of Bourne.
2,Not impressed,"It does not has enough action, follow to story, and connection. The them left wondering if he was better than Bourne at the end. Does not like it."
2,Bourne Legacy,Too many and too long chaces. Story with no conclusion.Charaxcers weve never seen before. Too much time spent on wondering plot
3,too long of a chase scene,I prefer the earlier Bourne movies because they have a bit more of a story line. this one was one big chase. Not enough dialogue for me.
2,Some good action scenes but that's about it,Disappointed in this movie. Just glad I didn't pay movie theater prices to see it. The action scenes were kind of fun but the plot was tired and boring.
2,Great action but NO story,"This movie jumps around in time a lot, grabbing sequences from the last Jason Bourne movie, but nothing ties it all together, unless they are laying open-ended groundwork for a sequel. But why bother, when the first movie is so awful.Even for a ""Bourne"" movie, the ending is a stretch. Overall a disappointment."
3,Good action/adventure,"Good action flick if you like that genre. The plot is somewhat plausible, the action entertaining, the acting very good, but the end was disappointing...an end without an end. Jeremy Renner is great in his role, my favorite movie from the on-screen odyssey of Jason Bourne adventures."
1,Stupid,"Total waste of time. Really. If you see it on Netflix, don't watch it. It's not good - at all!"
2,Not as good as the other.,This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes. This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes.View tips and guide lines
4,Good Action!,"I enjoyed the Bourne sequels and this one is just as good. Is this the end ... who knows, but I enjoyed the ride. However, we kept wondering if Jason would make a cameo somewhere, which would have been nice just to see that he was watching, but no one saw him kinda thing. If you liked the other films you will like this one as well."
5,As Good or better than the orhers in the seris,"Well done, I was reprehensive at first. No Matt Dameon, who else could possibly be Jason Bourne?I throughley enjoyed it. Plenty of action a role played with excellence.Highly recommend this movie."
2,The Bourne Leacy,"I am disappointed in this movie. The actor is good but the story is confusing, takes a while to understand just what the theme is and I am disappointed that Matt Damon wasn't the star in this. I watch the other Bourne movies quite a bit and enjoy them but this is a throw-away!!!!! Sorry but that is my opinion."
3,Bourne Review,"Big fan of last 3 movies. Somewhat of a letdown. Not a total waste, though. Not a satisfying end to the movie."
4,"Great, clean movie",If you don't mind shootouts as in previous Bourne movies then this is a great clean alternative to other action movies.
3,Decent,"Not nearly as good as the previous Bourne. The action scenes were good, but the plots failed to intrigue me."
2,The tittle has nothing to do with the movie,"I'm not a fan of movies without an ending, but this one should be a movie by itself. Enough is enough the Bourne movies are over. The movie is a disappointment for a sequel, unless it's free. Not worth paying!!!"
2,worst of the bourne series.,this was the worst of the bourne series. couldnt figure out were this one belonged. story started out nowhere and went nowhere. very dissapointing.
2,"Not much ""Bourne"" about the movie!","I was expecting a ""Bourne"" movie and that is not what this movie is. They talk about Jason Bourne but that is about it and only a little of that even. This was an entirely different movie. Very disappointing as I love the Bourne movies."
3,Not as good as the previous versions,Didn't really like the ending. The movie should have much much much more content. Previous Bourne movies had much much more action.
5,Great action flick,"A new hero in this series is not a problem. Great action, acting and non stop chase scenes! If you like action you will enjoy this film."
3,It's an okay movie. Weak tie in to Bourne series,Kept my attention but had nothing to do with the Bourne series other than a few references.Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon.
3,Ehhh,It was OK as an action movie goes but it wasn't a Bourne movie! Get back to the original and I will continue being a fan!
5,not disappointing at all,"This movie was far better than I had expected it to be. I didn't think it could live up to the other Bourne movies but it was definitely as good, if not better. There will be more, I am sure."
4,and the action continued,good pace through the moviegood tangent and (supposed) insight into our government and the dark secrets that could be out there...LOL
3,"Watchable, but a bit disappointing","A big Jeremy Renner fan, but this could have been so much better! I hope if they continue with him, they get better writers!"
2,it's was ok,It was ok and merging the jason bourne to this one was good however .....the idea behind it to get a virus and them being chased.I didn't get the same intensity as the other bournes. Good but average good.
3,The Bourne Legacy,The Bourne Legacy. I liked the movie but the format was narrow with a black band at top and bottom.
3,Hard to follow,Had to watch it 2 times to understand what was going on. After the second watch I liked it much better.
2,Movie was a let down.,I didn't think it lived up to the Bourne Series. I like both of the actors but I think the script was poorly written. Jumping on rooftops was on the Bourne Ultimatum. Not very original. I actually found it a little boring.
2,Not really that good,"This was a typical bond style movie, or worse. It's plot twists were predicable, the action senses were below average, but wait there's more he has two genes altered so he can do anything. Let the adventure begin, wow. How is it that you can shoot rockets, machine guns, grenades, etc and they never seem to die.We need new writers in Hollywood.It is a good movie for a time waster so rentable, but not buyable."
1,Digital copy trouble,"I loved the movie, so this is not a review of content, but form: I've been trying for an hour to redeem the digital copy for Amazon Instant Video, and the Universal site absolutely is not working. Disappointing, because I stream movies more often than not - use discs for extras. Much prefer the physical digital copy we used to get in combo packs."
1,"Should be titled ""The Bourne Knockoff""","The movie literally was like watching a lame Chinese copy of Bourne. The pacing was extremely off. Tony Gilroy, the same person that directed Michael Clayton, directed this film. Trust me, it felt like you are watching Michael Clayton, if you've ever seen it. As typical with indie directors that cannot make action films, the action scenes were very amateur and poorly executed. I'm quite sure this was not the movie Universal was expecting. It honestly felt like an arthouse film. It could have been saved with massive editing. Honestly, I can't ever recommend watching this film. The acting was superb, I will let that be clear. However, this should have had the Bourne name taken off. It's a disgrace to the franchise."
2,Movie was way too long,"This movie was a huge disappointment. It was just a rip off of the earlier Jason Bourne movies which I enjoyed. There wasn't much plot or suspense, but plenty of ridiculous chase scenes. The motorcycle chase at the end lasted forever. So did the movie which ran two and a half hours.Jason Bourne is referred to, but this plot had nothing whatsoever to do with him. A new agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is introduced. When the scientific research supporting genetic testing on agents is discontinued, everyone on the project must be eliminated.I guess they tied this movie to the popular Bourne movies to pull people in. That's not a good idea if they ever intend to do another real Jason Bourne film."
1,Mind numbing boredom,"I didn't want to see a Bourne film without Bourne. However, Renner and Norton convinced me to give it a shot. Big mistake. This movie is a pathetic attempt to revive a story that has already been told. The first half hour to 45 minutes is mind numbing talk that tries and fail to reel you in with Bourne Ultimatum flashbacks. Renner and Weisz have little or no chemistry. After an hour and a half of agony, I finally left, went home and watched the Bourne Identity. How anyone who loved the original trilogy could possibly compare it to Legacy, it makes no sense at all."
2,Too Complicated,"This movie, unlike other Bourne movies, was hard to keep track of. I like Bourne movies because in the past they have kept my attention and were exciting to watch. I paid $15.00 for a movie that was not entertaining."
2,The Bored Legacy,"Two great lead actors, loads of potential, it's shame this was so disappointing. Renner is a perfect choice for the next iteration, but the director sacrificed plot/character attempting to prove this was a Bourne installment. Far too many flashbacks to earlier films. Decent action and chase scenes but they don't compensate for the thin content. Not worth the purchase price, IMO. Go back and rent the original trilogy."
3,Overthought and Conveluded,"There's no question that this isn't nearly as sleek as the original Bourne movies which optimized on minimum plot and maximum ass kicking. Legacy tries to follow suit but suffers from a mix of over-reaching, failed execution, and a convoluted plot. Jeremy Renner is without a doubt sexy as hell but even he couldn't carry this sub par installment. I thought that this was going to be a kind of domino effect/fall out of what happened with Jason Bourne, unfortunately it felt like two different stories being told at the same time and neither one of them is very good. Nothing is really gained from the events of this movie so it felt like a total and complete waste of time. I know they're setting up for a new franchise but that ending was possibly one of the worst endings I've ever seen."
2,Do not watch,"This was NOT Jason Bourne or anything of the such. This was a guy hooked on steriods/virus and he needed his FIX. There was no action until the end and then it was, ""that's it?"". The movied ended with the inclination that there will be another one to follow. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you have two hours to kill and there is nothing better to do with your life."
2,weak movie,Acting poor-story line hard to follow-where is Matt?The other Boune movies were much better.Would not remmend this movie to others.
2,The Bourne Letdown,This movie had no real plot and went nowhere. The ending seemed to be in the middle of the movie and left me wondering if they just ran out of film at that point or realized what a poor story line they had going and just decided to quit.
3,"Good, but not nearly as good as ""The Bourne Trilogy""!","I think that the absence of Matt Damon made a huge difference in the ""Legacy"". From the very last scene in the ""Ultimatum"", viewers knew that Bourne had survived and it would have been possible to have his story continue with Matt Damon."
4,Action Packed Film,The film was action packed and Jeremy Renner played his part well. The main character was not portrayed as a replacement for the Matt Damon character; Jeremy Renner's character was a continuation of the Bourne conspiracy. I Would watch it again.
2,Story is Missing,"Starts off slow and gets worse from there.Starts off with the character going from one place to another in Alaska seemingly on a training exercise. The journy is less believable as he progresses. Of course there is some incident that turns him against his organization and the stroy trots along with him trying to stay alive while getting to the next phase in the story, which is in the Philippines. After a few close calls everything works out just fine, as predicted.They mention Jason Borne a few times in the movie and bring back Pam Landy just to make the connection to the original series.Overall a 2 thumbs down."
2,Stinker,"I had such great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed all of the previous ""Bourne"" movies. But this is a STINKER! The entire movie is running and chasing without any development of the characters or plot. What a waste of time!!!! Too bad, because I like the actors, but they really should have had some control of the script. This is nothing more that cashing in on previous movies - too bad."
3,Just another Bourne movie,"I expected some kind of twist or something interesting to grab the attention. Unfortunately, it was pretty much the same old movie."
2,Good movie but lacks Bourne style action,The Bourne Legacy isn't a bad movie and it is worth watching but it lacks the typical Bourne action that made the first two excellent movies.
1,A real sleeper,"This movie had misguided direction, no character development, and a very poor script. As one of most boring movies I have ever watched and movies so do not waste your time renting or buying. The story plot was all over the place and made no real sense of where it was trying to take and/or where it took you.By the end you just want it to be over."
3,not jason,The plot took too much time to develop. Too much useless political posturing. Action is good at the end of the movie. I feel as if there is a lot left out and the book is better.
1,Poor quality,I loved the movie and could not even finish it...The quality was horrible. I already sent a email to amazon to hopefully get refunded or get another 48 hours to view. I would like to finish this movie. It kept stopping in the middle and I would have to start from the beginning.
2,Jeremy Renner is Great,"I'm loyal to Matt Damon and don't understand making a Bourne film absent him, but Renner is great. He is a fabulous actor. Why I gave this movie only two stars is because of Rachel Weisz, her performance is beyond obnoxious. Her American accent is horrendous and I think she totally overreaches and overacts - - her high pitched whining squeaky delivery is like nails down a chalkboard. I liked Rachel Weisz until this movie - - she is no Cate Blanchett. I don't buy her as American (not just because her accent is horrible, but because she isn't believable) and I definitely don't buy that she is from Chicago????!!!!!!!!!!!When we get toward the end and she is no longer whining and Renner is leading the scenes then, and only then, is she bearable.If I were giving stars out just for her performance alone, I'm afraid it would be a big fat ZERO.Norton is great, as always.I'd have liked to see Naomi Watts in Rachel Weisz's role."
1,Bad download,I did not watch the movie becase it did not all download. Not happy!! Could not figure out how to get help.
5,another great Bourne adventure,I have seen all the Bourne Legacy movies. This may be the best yet. The good news is it leaves openings for future sequals.
4,great movie,i love the bourne series and i wish Matt Damon would have stuck with it as he was awesome in the role. but this is a solid well done flick.
5,Great movie,"Like the others, action, chases, shooting and suspense.The views from mountain scenes are incredible.Integrating the Predator into the movie was great.All told very well done."
3,It was entertaining.,I am no movie critic but did find this entertaining. It wasn't as good as the previous two but still did the job of wasting 2hrs of my life with no complaints.
1,blew chunks,ever been expecxting that movie to come out for some reason you cant go see it at theatre but then you rent on dvd. well this movie wasnt even worth the rental!
2,Borning,This movie did none of the other Bourne movies justice. It was actually very boring. It did not keep my insterest at all. Very disappointed.
3,"Some Exiting chase scene, but....","I'm afraid the ""Bourne"" series has had it's run. Most everything was predictable and the ending was at best disappointing. The chase scene through Manila was very good, (Not Great). This is a good rental, nothing more."
2,chase scene too long,"As a big fan of the first three I was leary of no Damon. However I was immediatly of with the premise as I started getting into the movie. But the movie really dragged on for me, especially the final chase scene. It was way too long and boring and unecessary. Bottom line, the movie bored me."
3,No Jason Bourne,"I didnt feel that the character had much depth. The character was fine but honestly I enjoyed Renner better in Mission Impossible 3. The beginning snow scenario was not all that exciting. In the scene where he saves the girl in the house things start to pick up, but then he goes to the Philippines and he's involved in the longest police chase in the world and the ending was pretty weak. (but I wont spoil it) Just not up to other Jason Bourne standards."
5,The Bourne Legacy,"Great movie, the whole group is great, this one falls right in line and is just as good as the rest."
3,So So Bourne Legacy,"The action was good and the story line was decent but the ending was completely pinched, right when it was getting good. I could have waited for this one to be on the movie channels and saved my money."
2,"If you like the other Bourne films, don't buy this one",Quite disapointed in this film. Just a remake of the other Bourne films with different actors. Glad I didn't waste my $$ at the movies. The motor bike chase scene was SO long I fast-forwarded through a lot of it and it was so unbelievable. Glad it was on sale.
2,Poor Imitation,"This film is a poor imitation on the original Bourne series. Then again, I wasn't a fan of the second or third Bourne films either. The first film was a novel idea about a programed evil ""superman"" who discovers his powers and his goodness. The subsequent Bourne films have been just a repetition of the first film."
2,Not ready for Bourne,"This film, lacks the cerebral and intellectual content of the other Bourne films. It seems focused on car chases and explosions, without the substance. The premise is fantastic, but I would have liked to know more about the experiments and also more of the inside CIA operation. Edward Norton is good, and Jeremy does fine although he is no Jason Bourne.If I had known this was just another mindless action flick, I would not have wasted my time."
3,I love the Bourne movies,"But this was largely a meh experience. In the Matt Damon helmed Bourne movies there is always a very clear rationale for why things are happening on screen. In this version, we're meant to feel bad for Jeremy Renner but I never really bought into the Flowers for Algernon story line. Edward Norton (who even knew he was in this movie) is totally underutilitized. I thought they had a nice setup with the story parallelling the last Bourne movie, but it didn't really go anywhere and man does the movie just end with a dud."
2,"Great action, silly plot","If you shut your brain off, this is a great action movie. However, the underlying political premise that our government kills it's own agents at the first sign of liability is completely ridiculous. Did Michael Moore come up with the idea for this plot?"
3,Good not great,A reasonable heir to the series but the least of the four. Cool beginning but by the end of the protracted final chase scene I had had enough. There was not a conclusive ending - nothing complete.Can anybody come up with an original chase scene.
3,Disappointed,Not as good as the three previous Bourne movies. Matt Damon is missing. Changes the whole slant on what came before.
3,Where's Matt Damon?,Without him it's just another action flick. Jeremy Renner is fine but lacks the charm to create an unforgettable character.
4,Excllent,Good action and A possibility to build on the original plot of the series without bringing it all together it will give them a little wiggle room for another if they want to tie them all together.
3,Weird story telling,"This movie seemed to rely to much on its predecessors. The story was choppy, and cur poorly. The ending was predictably open ended."
2,Not as good as the others ...,"Matt Damon got out of the series because he was too old. The producers made the mistake of not having the lead roles go to younger actors. Rachel Weisz (42) is not athletic enough and Jerry Renner (41) is not a good enough actor. In the other movies the best scenes are the fight scenes, in this film there are hardly any. The chase scene at the end is good."
4,Edge of your seat,"Good action & kept you on the edge of your seat. You ad to wait for the plot & it was not too slowly built, maintaining your attention & always waiting on the edge of your seat."
4,Jeremy renner,Good actor....when an actor can make his craft appear natural-convincingly accurate they get my vote...Of course you know a sequel is down the road.
3,Not as good as the previous three,"Couldn't wait to get this movie because I didn't get to see it in the theater. I was a little disappointed, not with the acting, but with the story and special effects. It just didn't measure up to the first three Bourne movies."
2,Disappointed,"Not as good as the others. Slow, drawn out, mundane, and overall boring. Man versus nature versus predator drone. Want a good Bourne movie get one of the others. This one was reaching."
2,The Bourne Legacy,Not as good as Jason Bourne. The movie is too cut up and difficult to follow. Action is ok but I don't think it is up to par with other Bourne movies
2,Not even close,"Using clips from previous ""Bourne"" movies was a cheap trick to use up footage in an other wise mediocre movie"
1,Wasted Two Hours,This thing is in search of more than a director; it needs a story line. An ending would help too.
4,Not the same without Damon but pretty good on it own,"The Bourne Legacy is a finely made film and if you were to watch it on its own, it holds up pretty well. The story of Aaron Cross and the extension of Treadstone is gripping with some great action sequences that one would expect from the Bourne franchise. However, the moment you compare it to the previous trilogy, the comparison makes this fade into fourth spot in terms of narrative and plot. Hopefully they will tie it all together and bring back both Cross and Bourne in what will make an excellent film. Renner has done a phenomenal job bringing intensity and convincing action sequences to the film."
4,my legacy,"review on the blu ray version of this movie as follows -movie - 4 / 5video - 4.5 / 5audio - 4 / 5though not the best of the series, this one ends for another film to follow.video was crisp and audio was good.looking forward to the followup..."
2,Lots of violence - not much mystery.,"Sadly, this movies is missing Matt Damon, a reasonable script and focus on movie making mot violet chases. Having enjoyed the quality of the first three movies, I was disappointed by a shallow, predictable film."
4,"Great movie, but....",The movie was great till the end. hate how it ended but the movie up until then was great. Worth watching.
3,Pales in comparison to the original Bourne Identity,"I enjoyed this movie as an action film, but I didn't think it was as good as the original Bourne Identity series."
3,Rather Lame Legacy,"I can understand why Matt Damon didn't want to make a movie with this director. Even though they tried to weave the plot into the first three movies it just doesn't work in my opinion. The majority of the time it felt plodding and disjointed. Jeremy Renner was adequate in the roll, but as much as I like Rachel Weisz her character and portrayal was simply annoying. I'm not sure which was worse, Tony Gilroy's screenplay or his directing. And to top it off Amazon charged a dollar more than usual for the HD version of this rental. I felt like it was a waste of time and money."
2,Not the same without Matt,Very confusing movie. No comparision to Matt Damon. Hope he come back for the next one.Love the other Bourne Movies.
3,Not so bad,"Not horrible, but not my favorite Bourne movie. I think they needed to get more in-depth with the storyline and how it connected to the originals."
2,Shame so sad to see it go down hill,I have to say I was a huge fan of all the Bourne movies but this one went to far away from what I've known it to be. I like the actors that wasn't the problem it was the story and plot - so sad and not even worth a rental to be honest.
2,The Boring Legacy,I saw all three previous Bournes and this one was disappointing. I expected more action and the chase scene was too long.
4,Bourne Legacy,Loved the movie had to really pay attention to stay with story. It was a bit different then the other Bourne movies not so predictable. It kept you on edge .
4,Good but not quite up to the first 3,"I enjoyed The Bourne Legacy. It was engaging and entertaining. However, it wasn't as good as the first 3 Bourne movies - I missed seeing Matt Damon in the lead. It was a good movie and the future ones might sharpen up to the level of the first three, it just seemed as though Jeremy Renner was just not quite there yet."
4,Nice addition to the triology,Nice addition to the Trilogy. Didn't realize that the story line runs parallel with one of the other 'Bourne' movies.
2,A sad coda to a strong trilogy,"The Bourne creators had a strong trilogy. It wasn't Lord of the Rings, but they had crafted a nicely-woven narrative that finishes the way it begins. Why not exit the stage and leave it alone? Money.First off, the storyline makes no sense. And once you've thought carefully about the plot, you're left wondering why you should care at all. After watching this movie twice, I still can't figure that out.I don't want to spoil it for anyone considering buying the movie -- but it is a sexed-up story of someone trying to get their medication. With satellites, drones and assassins mixed in.If this movie is playing on an airplane, sure, watch it. If the neighborhood mega-store is handing out free copies, sure, take it. (And regift to someone who doesn't mind illogical action.) But don't spend money on this."
5,Great Movie,"Having now watched this movie for the second time, I have found that it is even better. Enjoyed it very much, Matt Damon still did the best job, but Jeremy is a very close second."
3,Good Movie,Good Movie but not as great as other Bourne series. Don't keep expectation as high as other movies in this series.
5,You won't be disappointed!,I was afraid this ongoing saga would not be as good without Matt Damon. Jeremy Renner does not disappoint and picks up the reins without skipping a beat!
4,Good continuation of story,This Bourne story was a good continuation of the story but it felt like it was missing something when I finished watching it. Perhaps I might've just wanted a mash-up of Renner's character to mesh in more with Jason Bourne's character. It followed the same kind of progressions as the previous 3 stories but nothing substantially new. Overall a good watch though.
4,Decent movie that follows the Bourne style,"Fairly entertaining movie with a good story line and action, but leaves certain elements unfinished and open for another movie"
3,Bourne Deficiency,"The new actor lacks the ice coolness of the original actor. Seems like a steroided adolescent. Script too twisted to couple with original series. Weak history. Good photography, special effects."
3,Choppy and poor quality,"I have 12mb up and down. The video was in and out of very poor quality and HD. Throughout most of the movie the video was choppy and in some places the audio was off.The movie it's self was entertaining, but at times it was hard to see what I was supposed to be looking at on screen. Glad I didn't see it in the theater."
2,Not up to par,"I was big fan of the first three movies. This was a huge letdown. Average acting, little action..... Don't waste two hours of your time."
2,This Is Only Half a Movie and Not Much at That,"Jeremy Renner is brilliant. I can not say that for the rest of this film, however. This film is slow and methodical to the point that the viewer actually begins to lose interest. It finally picks up the pace and brings a lot of pieces together to what I imagined to be an explosive finale of drama and heroics and discovery of who is who in this complex film. But, that never happens. The film ends in in the middle of the story in my opinion, and the opinion of many others I spoke with. This film had a good idea, but the filmmakers could not pull it off. Basically, this film lacks the narrative flow that it so desperately needed to entertain and draw the viewer in. Jeremy Renner gives an interesting performance., but he can't save this film alone. My expectations were much higher."
2,30 minutes lost,"This movie was a real disappointment. I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes into the movie. I was expecting a movie equally exciting as the previous Bourne series. Not so, this movies seems to drag as the back story and plot is being developed. I cannot comment on the last half of the movie because I was was trying to find the 30 minutes of mu life I lost watching it in the first place."
2,Completely different - Call it Bourne Ripoff,"There is no Jason Bourne, or much of anything to do with him, except vague references and a few other character glimpses. The plot is thin and goes almost nowhere. Where it does go is predictable. Wait for something to happen for two hours by watching this or paint dry."
1,bad deal,Wasting you time if you expect to get the digital or ultraViolet copy as stated I have had the movie over two weeks and I have to instatll the actuall discuss to see the movie.
2,Didn't like it,"lame story, bad script, not even enough 'action'.... not a movie that you'll remember even a minute after it ends. waste of a good night, good wine, and good money."
3,Nice follow up,Nice follow up but the ending is a bit abrupt. The good thing is that it leaves you wanting more. The bad thing is that it leaves you wanting more.
2,Total Bour,"Can't believe this sits at 4 stars on here. Had to counteract with a counterattack. I adore the first 2 Bourne Movies in this series, the 2nd being my favorite (it had feeling, vision, and purpose) , the third feeling a little too handheld even for me, but it ends very well.. ""Bourne Legacy"" is muddled and so far afield from what was introduced in the original movies that it's indecipherable. Had they not transplanted Jason Bournes picture in this I would have never even guessed this was the same series.. different colored pills/medications/dosages? Where did this come from? The movie moves at a snails pace, and although I've liked Renners' performance in everything up until now, particularly ""The Town"" I have got to steer as many people away from this mess as humanly possible.. not the worst movie ever but one of the worst sequels in recent memory."
2,Boring and predictable,The title for this review says it all - Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable.
2,Not Bourne,"I wasn't expecting the Jason Bourne character, but I was expecting more substance. Yes, they alluded to Jason Bourne, even some of the same actors were the same as previous movies and Jeremy Renner can act, but the movie was hard to follow and just lacking."
