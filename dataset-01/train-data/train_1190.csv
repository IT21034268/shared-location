2,"Great topic, awful technique","I couldn't get 20 pages into it, and I am a HUGE medieval history buff. I actually left the coffee shop where I was reading it, walked back to the bookseller's from whence it came, and asked for a refund. The writing was so rife with errors of grammar and punctuation that it distracted me from the subject matter, and that's death for any book. How this Oxford-educated chap managed to become a best-selling historical author with all his run-on sentences and clumsy, repetitive word choices is a mystery. (How many time can you use the term, ""not to mention"" in a single page?) To be charitable, maybe he had really good editorial support for his earlier works; but the editor who allowed this mess to go to press without being vetted for correct grammar should be pilloried and pelted with hardbound copies of the Chicago Style Manual."
4,For this cd Joe was his usual brilliant self.....,"For this go round Joe turned out another splended performance with his Steinway. This has got to be one of his all time great cds.To be honest, Joes plays my kind of music, the standards. He played the piano for this cd with a lot of soul and used a lot of great imigination for his arrangements. He seemed to never miss a beat.The song selection was good to excellent.You solo piano fans need to add this gem to your collection!"
4,"Like the Litter, a grossly underrated band.","This double CD set is a testamony of how a band like Deep Purple soared to the top by adding two members of Episode Six. Episode Six has the beautiful harmonies of the likes of the Mamas & the Papas, Peanut Butter Conspiracy, However with a ""Bareknuckle barroom brawling attitude."""
1,muddled,Axiomatics and superstition make a bilious mix.The book has an extremely narrow ideological focuspandering to the hardcore religious right. Anothersad attempt to set the clock back.
4,Giant Pail....too Giant!!,"We bought this set for our 3 year old and 18 month old for use at the beach. The set overall was great, but the picture does not give the ""giant"" beach pail justice. It's HUGE! In fact, it would be too big for a small child to carry once it's filled with sand or water. It comes with a smaller pail, which is very small. We took the smaller items to the beach and the ""giant"" pail is used for storing stuff at home. It's a good set though for the other items included."
5,Educational and entertaining,"Marsha Skrypuch has produced, in Hope's War, an important and significant work. The story examines injustice and prejudice through its travel to a little-known part of history. Blending the past with current events, Hope's War is sure to be a book with which modern teens will identify."
2,Great ideas but poor execution,"I own a slightly different version of this product and I'd advise against buying it.Pros: (1) excellent feature package -- temperature, two alarm clocks, projection; (2) auto-sets date & time from atomic clock; (3) alarm noise gradually increases over about 30 sec from simple clicks all the way up to loud beeps (best I've ever had at waking me up without being jarring)Cons: (1) RANDOMLY GOES OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT; unclear why it loses timezone data, but it does, and at odd intervals it will go off at 2:05 AM instead of 7:05 AM, for example. No easy way to fix this; (2) very weak time projector; (3) useless backlight; (4) odd screen crystal makes it hard to read except dead on."
3,"4.5"" CONCRET GRINDING DISC.","I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY IN OUT. IT LOOKS OKAY, BUT I TRUEFULLY CANNOT RATE THIS PRODUCT AT THIS TIME."
1,A trust sales brochure; and not even a good one,I read this book and wish I could meet the author and ask her if she thinks all senior citizens are stupid. The books talks down to seniors and is a thinly disguised sales brochure for the author's sub-par living trusts.I wish she was more honest in the book; she obviously have never stepped foot inside a court before. All she has done is take advantage of seniors unable to see her for what she is; a trust peddler. This book is a sad tomb of lies and half truths. Better books exist from authors who actually practice law in courts.
1,Very little truth,"The second book I have found by this author, who gives little truth and much fluff. Sad she is an attorney, let alone an author, this woman is clearly a trust mill selling trusts. I should have known by the ""author's"" other book that this would be a terrible waste of time. Save your money; get your information for the state bar or a practicing attorney; not a trust mill selling seniors a bad bill of goods. Her readers and clients are ill served by her work. She is not even certified by the State Bar as a specialist!"
3,Christmas collectibles,"This is an area of collecting that I am moving into and didn't realise there was that much out there, This is a very informative book I now just have to find the featured items"
1,Disappointment,"Perhaps the title misled me (and certainly the cover on an earlier edition which pictures a woman doing upward facing dog pose--which is not even mentioned in the book), but this book was a real disappointment. Much of the text (granted, I read it briefly) seemed rather ""cold"" and the illustrations as well. It is NOT for beginners as many of the poses are rather difficult, and the routines do not really have a flow to them. Definitely not a ""user-friendly"" introduction to yoga!"
5,Extra Hot Jalapeno Mustard was a Great Party Hit,So glad I ordered a Pack of 6 Beaver Extra Hot Jalapeno Mustard. I gave several of our friends a bottle of it to take home. They also plan on purchasing more through Amazon. A great product!! I highly recommend the Jalapeno Mustard.
5,A 2007 Association of Jewish Libraries Notable Book for Younger Readers,"""A bubbe, a savta, no two are the same, each grandma is special whatever her name"" begins this two-in-one ""flip book"" reminiscent of What Mommies Do Best/What Daddies Do Best and What Grandmas Do Best/What Grandpas Do Best by Laura Numeroff. In this version chimpanzee nanas bake challah, a kangaroo savta dances the horah and lights the menorah, ""bow-wowing bubbes"" celebrate Purim, grandma giraffe does a mitzvah, and grandma bunny makes a seder. On the flip side, a llama saba blows the shofar, a quail and snail saba make a kugel, zebra zayde enjoys the Israel parade, porcupine papa makes matzah, zayde sheep wears his talit in shul, and grandpa groundhog plants a tree on Tu B'Shevat. The cheery, colorful illustrations are delightful and the bouncy, rhyming text make this a wonderful book for Jewish grandparents to share with their grandchildren."
4,Very Nice,"Jazz instrumental with a bit of funk at times, often on the somber side - not cheesy or commercial sounding. Very good 5.1 mix and definitely recommended for that."
2,okay for drilling,"I am a contractor who uses a rotary hammer a few hours per week. I bought the Bosch 1 1/8 inch sdsplus rotohammer about 3 weeks ago, after a reconditioned and used milwaukee unit stopped hammering (after about three weeks). I was pretty happy, at first.A few days ago, I checked out some of the reviews on here, and grew concerned about the chuck loosening up. Sure enough, when I checked it out, it moved about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch with a 12 inch bit. I took it back.B.T.W., I contacted Bosch, and they basically said that SDS-Plus hammers aren't designed for much chipping. I do chip alot, so I am probably going to take thier suggestion and get an SDS-Max hammer. I may still get a Bosch.If you are planning on buying this hammer for drilling, it is probably a great tool (and the case is very well organized). If you plan on doing any chipping besides some very light chipping, I suggest getting an SDS-Max or spline drive. You may be disappointed in any SDS-Plus hammer."
5,Nice and easy,I borrowed this tool to dril 12 holes in concrete for anchoring. 6-inch deep and 3/4-inch in diameter. I finished the job in less then 20 minutes. Acctually drilling time was only about 10 minutes. So smooth and easy to use.
5,Fast and easy,"I bought the Bosch 11236VS Rotary Hammer after I had almost knocked my self out using my Makita rotary hammer to drill 3/4 inch holes in a wall made of pavers. The Bosch, in comparison, is increadibly smooth, fast, and easy to use. It drills through concrete, pavers, and ceramics much faster and with a lot less wear tear on the operator. If you are likely to need a lot of 1/4 inch to 1-1/8 inch diameters holes in concrete this is the best tool I've found for the job."
1,Poor quality again,"Poor quality again, January 25, 2004Reviewer: Handyman, Jack of All Trades from Hendersonville, NC USThis model of the Bosch line of rotary hammers is a failure. Less than a days work and the chuck is so sloppy as to make the tool impractical to use. I am returning it to my home improvement center. It has nice features but just is not durable in chipping mode. The tool was used to chip out 9 cinder block house vents. After the fourth vent the chuck became extremely sloppy. I hope Bosch can fix this problem."
3,"It worked, some wobble, no trigger lock.","I bought it new, the SDS+ design did allow some wobble from minute one even with new bits. It was looser than I expected. The chuck design made it very difficult to change bits. There is also no trigger lock so you have to manually hold the trigger all the time and some of these hammer drill type jobs can be long. Overall it worked, I drilled 20 12"" deep holes in solid bedrock with a 7/8"" bit. It took 15 minutes per hole, it got pretty hot, the bit wobbled some always but not enough to screw up the holes and I had to hold the trigger constantly which was a pain. It worked so I was happy but a few things could be improved. The wobble was the biggest concern. If you need perfect holes this will not do it."
3,"Good Drill, Bad Chuck","The title says it all. Bosch makes some good drills (the Bulldog, for instance) but this ain't one of them. As others have said, the chuck is crap and wears out with minimum usage ($70 at a Bosch repair center). Bosch has poor customer service in my opinion compared with Dewalt. Their on-line customer service Rep is not a Tech but more of a go between who must consult with a Tech to answer any questions. Their final answer: ""All SDS chucks have play in them"". Baloney!"
4,Great drill!,"I give this drill 4 stars because I have only had it for a couple of weeks. Currently using it on a job, drilling and chipping through 6 inches of concrete, and it is doing great. Next year I would give it 5 stars if it was still performing as it is now. This is a great drill if you need to do some light chipping as well as drilling. Certainly the price is excellent compared to the competition. Interesting to research SDS bit systems and see that Bosch was the originator of these standards. I am fully expecting this drill to meet expectations."
2,poor quality,"If you purchase the model 11236VS it will not be your last rotary hammer if you have my luck. I used the 11236 for 2 hours & the sds chuck was so sloppy I couldn't believe it.The tool has great features, but the quality just isn't there. I spoke with a tool rental agency & was told never to use the 11236 for chipping.What ever the problem is I would hope Bosch will take corrective action."
2,Smoking drill,"I loved my 11236VS SDS Rotary Hammer until I used it to mix thinset. I burned up the windings. White smoke now pillows from the drill. It was only the 5th time I'd used it, but as it outside of one year it is no longer under warranty. Knew I should have bought a Hilti."
2,Not as strong as i expected,I remember using another brand oil which was so strong that even 2 drops were enough for the whole room. This one is no way close to that. I use about half tea spoon for my child's bed but the aroma doesn't last more than 1 hour and I can barely smell it. I have used half the bottle in 4-5 days.
1,This is NOT Shaolin Soccer!,"This movie is a low budget waste of time, and NOT Shaolin Soccer. This is called Shaolin Family Soccer, see what they did there? Save your money for the real version."
5,Christopher Morley is a favorite!,"I love Christopher Morley's essays. They are like candy for me. Pipefuls contains some essays that are dated, with references to people whose names are not familiar. But there are several essays in his somewhat hedonistic, enjoying-life style. Fun to dip into when I have a moment to sit down with a cup of coffee."
4,Amazing Illustrations,"For me, the primary draw to ""Anatomy of the Honey Bee"" is the illustrations. Carefully handdrawn honey bee stingers may not be your cup of tea, but I find them fascinating to look at. H.R. Giger has nothing on this stuff. The very idea that there are people in the world that are so infinitely (I dare not say ""intimately"") familiar with these insects is mindboggling.The text is interesting as well, but I've never read it straight through. I find itmore fruitful to think of the text as extended captions to the amazing illustrations."
1,"I agree, it is a terrible book.","This book is a waste of paper. There are inaccuracies all over the book, and I found it infathomable that someone would try to pass off this information as being in any way useful to anyone. I am also a Reiki Master Teacher and Gendai Reiki Shihan."
2,"[bad] DVD, but great ...movie!","This has to be the worst looking DVD I have in my collection. The video quality is incredibly subpar, with really toned down colors and inexistent blacks. Yeah, the movie is presented in widescreen, but it's not anamorphic. I would bet my life that this DVD was mastered from a VHS tape. I swear I saw tracking issues at the start of the movie. And the subtitles are non-removable (and just as blurry as the video itself), ...P>As for the movie, what can I say, It's great. It is better documented elsewhere and if you are browsing this item, it means you know what you are looking for.My advice: get a multiregion DVD PAL-capable player and import the upcoming Region 2 release which is being supervised by Alex de la Iglesia himself. Should be greatOh, and this is not a Mexican movie, it's Spanish."
1,might be good for home or office use.,"I tested a DCS-2000 out as a security camera for my small retail store. I upgraded the firmware to 1.07 and IP surveillance to 2.12. At 320x240 i can't really make out a face more than 15 ft away, but a person moving at 10 ft alway causes the video to become choppy. I guess this system is good for areas where there are not much movement and where there is no need to have a clear image to ID a unknown person. The software and idea of this system is good, but that is about all that is good about this system."
2,Don't waste your money,"I've tried two of these units now, and neither of them work. The first wouldn't even get to where it's webserver was running and their tech support was useless. The second one will at least show a picture, but sometimes it likes to ignore web requests. Plus they seem to try to make it hard for you. It's very non-intuitive and has alot of things hard coded that shouldn't be.I guess this is an alright BASIC camera, but don't expect it to be able to do anything cool at all."
4,Excellent opportunity for novice and experienced knot-makers,"As a Scoutmaster, it is important to me to have the perfect knot for every occasion. In our Troop I have initiated a Knot-tying award that the Scouts can earn called the Order of the Knot. This book, which I keep as a reference, allows the Scouts to find new knots and practice them using the many photographs and very clear and understandable text. I have also found the information about decorative rope work interesting to try myself, and have found that it keeps me one step ahead of the Scouts, always ""raising the bar"" in their knot-tying education. I believe that there will always be opportunities to use the useful information in this book, and it will start the Scouts on a lifetime appreciation of this creative and useful skill. Mr. Fry has gone a long way toward opening a new vista for anyone who believes that rope can be fun and attractive, as well as useful!"
1,Dangerous Knots!,"Like another reviewer, I am dismayed by the inclusion of faulty and potentially life-threatening knots. The Carrick Bend is shown two ways. The first way is not a true carrick bend and is actually said to be one of the worst knots known (re Ashley Book of Knots, pg 263 knot # 1445). The only knots worthy in this book are the decorative knots (don't trust the practical knots)."
5,The Greatest Author,Caroline Cross is the greatest author that has ever lived! Read all of her books especially this one!
3,not for student budgets,"I am a student and Fodors is definitely not the guide book to use if you are a student. Let's Go is better for the truly budgeted person. Let's Go also has more detailed maps.Looking at the accreditations of the writers impressed me in that they had the inside scoops on hotels and restaurants, however they also all speak Spanish. For the non-native speaker, you can be treated less friendly in places where the local Spanish are favored over tourists.There were some bright spots in the book, like the coverage on Cordoba and the little blurbs on the history of certain well-known sights."
4,A masterpiece of an era,"I was almost 20 when I've been listening for the first time to this album in 1983. I was already ""Ultravox addicted"" at that time, and John Foxx was representing a sort of mith for the fans. This is a gorgeous album, combining electronic soounds with melody, dance music with experimentalims. This music is part of the history of neo pop and dance, supported by an authentic capability to play with invention."
3,The Golden Section,"A most welcome CD reissue of this electro classic from the height of the new romantic era. A solid dance beat permeates the entire album and the feel is definitely European. Excellent remastering and a few rare bonus tracks too. The only complaint I have, as always, is the omission of 12"" mixes such as 'Endlessly' and 'Like A Miracle'. Something to look forward to in the future?Update Oct 24, 2001 :After repeated listening, I realize there are quite a few fillers on the album, although the standout tracks are very good. Hence I took away one star. It's still better than 'In Mysterious Ways' though, in my opinion."
2,its OK,Using it to break through 6 feet of rock.... did ok but the handle feels cheap like its going to fall off and the darn thing just doesnt have the power i would like
2,me cobraron por el segundo disco y jamas me lo entregaron,"me cobran por el disco, después me salen que ya se descontinuo, y que me devolverían el dinero. ya nada ni dinero ni disco.vendedor no confiable!!"
1,Omen trilogy,In the description of the product should have the specifications of the films. This collection comes with subtitles in several languages &#8203;&#8203;but not Spanish.
4,"Great, but not vintage Kenny Lattimore","I know that artists gotta eat, but it seems like all of the contemporary artists (Chante Moore, Luther, Babyface) are changing their style to get more fans and make less boring music. Kenny is no different, but I actually liked his past contemporary songs (""Make Believe"", ""For You""). Most of the album has him sounding like every other R&B cat whereas in the past his voice and style was original. But the title track is good, as is the Damien Dane remake of ""When You Get Right Down To It"". Also, I applaud any album under 50 minutes, which is the case here."
4,r&b for the romantics,"I am a huge R&B fan and for a while I've been searching for something that is not like the so-called pop R&B stars such as Usher. This album is great, it's very smooth, sensual, and everything R&B is and should be. All the lyrics are great too. Track 1 is great for dancing to, it's the first song i heard from this CD on the radio. Track 2 is alright, not as strong, but still good. Track 3 has a different more exotic type of sound to it. All the recordings had different types of sounds to them which is one of the things that made this CD one of the best. The tracks between 3 and 7 are good for chillin' to but when track 7 just did it for me. I must have played it over and over again till I wore it out. The rest of the CD is great too. I really recommend it."
3,"Kenny Lattimore's voice and talent ""Don't Deserve"" canned R&B","Kenny Lattimore set the bar high with his debut cd,Kenny Lattimore. The second, equally magnificent:From the Soul of Man. I rated both albums five stars.While there is no denying this man can sing, 'Weekend' sounds too much like everything else on R&B; radio -- canned, formulaic, heavy programmed beats... It's a little disappointing since I know what he can do. Yet, it's still a must have for a Kenny Lattimore fan.I look forward to his next solo project."
2,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 33","* 1/2 Forgettable film directed by one of the greatest American filmmakers. Only the feminine characters, Alexandra Stewart, Lisa Langlois and Patricia Collins are maybe worth a look if you can find a copy of Phobia (some VHS are still available). The rest looks like a cheap TV movie."
3,If you are not Phobic already.....,"This is a dark movie, addressing the inner primal fear deep in us all. Stars Paul Michael Glaser, in a role you might be a wee bit surprised to see him portray. He plays a doctor on a grant program trying his own ""shock method"" to cure their ""Phobia's"". This is a good guy, bad guy movie that slowly sees each one of the doctors patients murdered. In the end he (Glaser)loses his grant program, and the police suspect it's the doctor killing is patients, with each (Glaser) has a aliby. When the doctor is found by his girlfriend, with his last patient, dead. The story begins to unfold. The end is shocking/disturbing. Suspense filled, at times hard to follow, vaguely predicable. I care not to watch it again."
4,Just another case for Inspector Maigret,"I have come to enjoy these lovely stories by Georges Simenon in the fine translations provided by Ellen Ellenbogen. This is the third mystery novel of Inspector Maigret that I have read and I must admit that I have become ever increasingly interested in the character of Maigret, that is to say how he works, his observations about life, his habits at the Brasserie Dauphine, etc.. While the situation around the specific case is always interesting, I find that I am drawn more towards Maigret's conversations with the suspects and with his own colleagues. The descriptions of the Paris environs always make me think back on my own walks through the streets of that noble city and will give any reader a nice sense of the small town feel of many of Paris' arrondisements. The mystery is fine...but stay for the deeper story."
2,The M.O. wouldn't work.,"The premise of this Maigret mystery is promising: A man found stabbed in a Paris alleyway with much more money in his pocket and wearing a different pair of shoes and tie than when he left his home in the morning. And why was he in the alley and not at work? These questions intrigue us and our Inspector as he attempts to find the murderer. But, the payoff is a huge dissapointment. First of all, there are crimes committed, but the M.O. of them is not feasible. Maybe, by luck, it could have worked once, twice at the very most, but when you consider it was used over and over within a few city blocks, it's impossible to think it would be successful. And further, the perp is caught due to police work in another city for which Maigret is the recipient of their determined efforts. He does very little to solve the case. The characters introduced in the book are quite interesting, but the plot and payoff are slow-going and disappointing. Not the best Maigret by a long shot."
4,Fine strategy game; very simple rules,"I bought this game several years ago for my father, who enjoys strategy games like Othello, Score Four and Pente. This game is in a somewhat similar vein, in that it is quite easy to learn the rules, but has layers of tricky strategy underneath. My dad enjoyed the game for several years, the more so when my much-younger sister started to beat him regularly.Like the other games I mentioned, this one is perhaps too abstract and cerebral for all tastes, which is why I give it only four stars for fun. (If your taste runs to such games, ratchet the rating up to the full five stars.) I can't speak directly to the durability of this ""travel version"" of the game; the version I bought was larger, all wood, and beautifully made. ..."
3,No photographs in this autobiography.,"This otherwise page-turning autobiography, written with style, feeling and insight, is diminished by the lack of any photographs. Other editions of Frank Lloyd Wright's autobiography always included numerous photographs of him, his ancestors, family, co-workers, friends, wives, children, houses, etc.FLW loved to ""hold court"" and always dressed the part of ""distinguished architect"", especially for photographers. Too bad that this edition does not include a single photo, either of the great man himself or anyone else in his life. FLW was a master of visual impact. This edition fails miserably in its lack of any photographs and the contribution they would have made to the life story of a man who lived very much in the public realm.Better to spend your money on FLW's autobiography published by Quartet Bks, London 1977, ISBN 0704321963, 616p., copywright, Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation."
4,FL Wright,"Eccentric as one would expect from Wright. His view of himself and the world is unigue, as complicated and cluttered as his praire houses are open and elegant."
5,Wright's amazing story,"I've studied Wright's architecture but never read his autobiography so I decided to purchase it. Wright's life story should be a movie. His autobiography is a great way to understand how he saw the world and himself. When reading you can follow where his ideas come from and reasoning behind them. This is a great book and well worth the money, in fact I'm surprised it doesn't cost more."
4,My Review,"Dangerous Minds is a really good book. The book talks about troubled students who are trying to get by in high school and in life. Most of their teachers gave up on them a long time ago, but there was one teacher who did not, that was Miss Johnson. She did everything to make sure they stayed in school. She even sacrificed her job to keep them in school and off of the streets. I would reccommend this book to anyone that is interested in education, wants to be a teacher, or is a teacher already. It was a very good book, and I enjoyed it a lot."
1,A pale imitation of its predecessors,"If you are interested n this type of story, buy To Sir With Love or Boys Town instead. Dangerous Minds is simply boring and predictable with nothing to make it memorable. There are a couple of decent performances from some of the minor characters but that's not enough to raise it above the sad script and cliche ridden dialogue.On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one."
4,great movie with great acting,this movie was great. it had great acting by the kids who played the students as well as michelle pfeiffer. i really liked this movie to the point where i own it on vhs and dvd. this movie is special because it was based on a school in my hometown.
2,"poor man's ""to sir, with love""","This is a poor film. A modernisation of ""To Sir, with love"" but why did they bother? Michelle Pfeiffer does not save this film. Go see the original."
5,"a tragic , sad , gritty masterpiece",i loved this movie because of it's realism. it has so much life to it.
5,Danger Never Looked So Good!,"Or plodded along so predictably ... now I'm not trying to say Michelle Pfeiffer isn't convincing as a tough-as-nails, kick your tail instructor, because I don't have to. Anyone with an IQ over 120 will figure that out instantly.Now, we all know that inner-city youths don't deserve as much attention as rich kids, so let's stop pretending that one teacher with a mission is going to make a difference in these loser kids lives. They aren't going anywhere except to a street corner or a stoop. I'm not judging anybody, just stating my perspective from a life filled with wisdom and multiple degrees on public policy, psychology and metallurgical engineering."
2,THESE MINDS AREN'T DANGEROUS THEIR JUST NOT AT ALL APPEALING,"Michelle Pfeiffer who is very talented and very beautiful failed to move me here as an ex-marine who becomes an English Teacher at an tough inner-city school where she confronts freaks and viloent students who don't want to learn. The message here is the fact that kids who are mouthy and think that they are tough have a right to do what they want, kind of stupid to see this film now and think it would actually make an impact on today's youth, with it's bland and unbelivable wish fullfilment. I don't see how poetry can tame tough,restive delinquents. Half hour into the film you will feel dissallusined on why you rented this video, and by the end you will throw the VCR or DVD out the window with the movie follwing behind it. Now that's a dangerous mind."
1,Nothing dangerous here,The movie is a big blob. It was nothing dangerous about this movie. The kids were cussing and fighting. Thats about in every movie. The only good thing about this movie is Coolio's song Gangster paradise. Thats it.
4,Great movie,"The only reason why I gave this 4 stars- is because they left a lot open-ended. Once Michelle Pfeiffer really started reaching out to the students and it started working, it seemed to fast forward to them having to take another class because now they were honors students. The movie takes a long time to build up in the beginning. It seems kind of unrealistic that her character could just walk into a classroom like that and because she could teach them karate she caught their attention. But it got better in once it started focusing on individual kid's stories, that's when I started to really get into it. Overall good movie, definitely sparks up some emotion!"
4,Thoughtful Original Education Triumph Film,"It is not the best movie ever made about a determined teacher but this movie always manages to impress me. It is not the teen acting roles so much as maintaining a plot about gangster young adults with a mainly rap soundtrack AND keeping different types of viewers engaged. It truly is an empowering film. If this is a first time choice, I do recommend this movie, it managed to gain a lot of critical acclaim not only from average people like myself, but nationally as well. Just beware for inappropriate treatment of women, violence, and vulgarity. Not for anyone under 13 without parent viewing previously."
5,dangerouse minds great movie,"this movie was great to watch..... it keeps you on your toes, because you dont know what going to happened next.... plus the teacher challenge the school on behalf of her class....."
4,ONE STORY MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE,"This book contains almost thirty short horror tales, some pretty good (Deadheads,fall of the sentinels,dead end kids revisited), some just time-killers (brain matters,blind devotion) and some pretty lame (daddy long legs-mercy killing), but if one SINGLE story can justify buying this book, its the story CHOICE CUTS, easily the creepiest, goriest ghoul tale I've read in years. This one harkens back to early S.King in style and delivery (probably Night Shift). I've read and re-read this sick, twisted little mind bender at least a dozen times, and it still shakes me. Vinson goes a little overboard with all the 'homages' to classic horror, but then again, it was a refreshing break from all the cruddy 'kiddie' horror out there these days."
2,Very limited,"I don't really know what advantage this vocabulary has over a small dictionary. It has the basics within each area of vocabulary listed, but goes into little detail. It is also for castilian only and some words are just not in use in some parts of Spain. This not to mention that Latin American variants are ignored all together. Not good value for money, in my experience!"
3,Customer Learning Curve,Not what I was looking for. Would recommend to those interested in business or marketing or college students pursuing a marketing or business degree.
4,"Interesting, But Not What I Thought I Was Buying","I bought this DVD thinking that it was a ""Greatest Hits"" type collection of performances -- but instead it was retrospective/tribute to Billy Connolly -- with a few bits of his live performances sprinkled throughout. There is about half an hour of standup at the end - but it's really not Billy's best stuff.As a documentary, it's very, very good. Eddie Izzard, Parkinson, Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Dame Judi Dench and Billy, himself, turn up in interviews here.But don't buy it if you are wanting to just see his standup."
4,Billy Connolly Erect after 30 years,"Hilarious,I really enjoyed this DVD by one of my favourite comedians. The comments made by Billy's fellow comedians and peers add new insight and appreciation into Billy and his unique comedy style. It's GGRRREEEEATE !!!!"
1,"Horrible, riddled with errors.","This book's physics presentation is at about a third grade level; it is riddled with typographical, grammatical, and physics errors. A good number of the questions in the practice test are keyed incorrectly to the answer sheet, and I spotted many completely wrong statements in the core material."
3,UNSATISFIED WITH COLOR TINTING OF WAXWORKS,"It ruins the scarey effect. Black and white film would be way scarier. And the musical score put on this dvd isn't frightening enough either. C'mon Kino, you guys could find a scarier score than this."
4,Good German Expressionism!,"A man answers an ad for a carnival. He is to tell the story of 3 infamous people in history who will be presented in wax in the waxworks. First is a tale of Horoun Al Rashid, from Ancient Baghdad, then Jack the Ripper and Ivan The Terrible. Stories nightmares are made of!"
1,not so good,"just did not care for it, too much of one peraon, now much can you look at one person, it really did not go anywhere, after about 5 minutes I was bored with it"
1,No Mas,"Please---not another PC book, full of deconstructionist jargon and only using the triple prism of the Left: race, gender and ethnicity."
2,Good book,"But the author is a nutcase.I've seen an interview with Nicholls on youtube(about the world cup in my beloved Germany).What a nutter.The way he talks about other Europeans und hissocalled enemies tells a lot about the kind of person he is.I say, lock him up and throw away the key."
1,Pathetic,Rubbish by a criminal. Idiots like this helped give English football a bad name. Because of people like Nichols I didnt get to see half the games I should have as a child - parents fears over violence. Anyone who says normal fans dont get caught in the crossfire is talking nonsense.An unverified account of utter trash that tarnishes the great name of a great club.
4,alaska fishing,"Bernie's book will help first-timers to Alaska cope with Alaska's vastness.He focuses on fish and economy.Travel books boil down to: Why make your own mistakes, when the author has already made them for us, and shares his knowledge with us?This book will save you a lot of trouble and make your trip more enjoyable.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
3,Good for the first time visitor,"This book is well organized and provides a great deal of useful information for the first time alaska visitor. The charts are particularly helpful as you travel along the highways. They quickly identify and rate all the major rivers and their salmon runs.However, there is very little information here that every traveler I met on the highways didn't seem to already know. All the rivers rated as excellent are known by every highway angler in the state and they are all vying for some room at these locations. The best way to discover 'good' fishing locations is from the alaskan neighbors you meet at the campgrounds. So, I feel it's a good get acquainted book. A one trip book. A useful handbook. Keep it on your dashboard."
3,Soehnle Bretaigne scale,"Strong points: precision, simple one-button design.Weak points: battery life (lithium button cell, not cheap and not readily available when you suddenly need one); repeatability of measurement; abrupt and unexpected power-off in the middle of adding multiple ingredients; hard-to-access grams/ounces switch; doesn't feel as solid as it looks."
3,Not to the point...,"I just purchased this scale and I have to say it looks nice but in grams it only lets me know ""about how much"". This scale is not showing complete accuracy due to the fact that in the grams unit a decimal point will not display, if you would like to weigh 4.5 grams the scale will just fluctuate between 4 and 5. Your guess is as good as the scale! It will help you guess correctly... I'll deal with it for now but if you're looking for a precise scale, keep looking this one is not for you."
4,A positive surprise,"I admit I only bought this book because I collect all VtDA material. I was really surprised of its excellent quality, I expected some kind of cheesy Viking book, but Wolves of the Sea immerses you in Norse mythology and culture. It would be an interesting read even if no vampires were featured in it. The material concerning vampires is top notch, too. Lots of interesting concepts, new discipline uses and excellent merits and flaws.The only drawback: it won't be compatible with every VtDA chronicle. On the other hand, it can enrich your campaign and creative players may create memorable characters."
4,Heart warming,"I purchased this Kindle book to read on a very long Amtrak ride home from a extended weekend, pre-holiday vacation. I found this book entertaining, thought provoking and heartwarming. Before I was half way through the book, I was missing my four cats ( and my dog) so much I had to stop for a break. It gave me time to think on my relationship with them and their influence on the lives of my family over the years.The writings encouraged thinking about our relationships with our cats in a more spiritual manner. I did not however, find the meditation segment at the end of each story very useful as they seemed rather limited in depth.I did enjoy this book and will encourage any individual who has been lucky enough to share their life with a pet to read it. Pet owners, animal lovers and those who can appreciate the spiritual role of pets in making people happier and healthier will find this book ""a keeper""."
5,Contributer of book sings praise for angel cats !,"Although I do have some predjudice towards the book, having written one of the many heart felt stories; I must say that the other stories have been on my mind. This is a wonderful and insgihtful look at how pets have really come into our homes and found a place in our souls. Just another way that the universe finds to keep us wrapped in love. The stories are well written, edited and sorted into meditations. A very thoughtful read that would make a wonderful read for the holiday season. For pet lovers past and present. Celebrate the pet angels in your life!"
4,Angel Cats: Divine Messengers of Comfort,This book has some great stories which are heart warming and meaningful for the soul. These stories are way for people to see that animals can truly love there human. I would give this book out for gift to people who are lonely and think that nobody can love them.
4,A mid 80's gem!,"As a huge fan of the Midge Ure Ultravox era, I was slow to discover the John Foxx solo catalog. I purchased one of the excellent compilations available and was hooked. ""In Mysterious Ways"" seems to get the most negative attention of all his releases. I thought that the CD was one of the best of the early to mid 80s releases by the artist. I particularly like his vocal presentation on this CD. Gone is the ""Gary Numan/John Foxx"" vocal presentation of earlier recordings. Instead is a strong melodic presence. The amazing thing about John Foxx is that each of his releases capture a different John Foxx. You could play one of the ealry 80s CD's by Foxx to someone and they wouldn't know it was the same artist. If you like mid 80s music/vocals this is a good introduction to John Foxx. If you are a fan of John Foxx early 80s stuff (The Metamatic sound), although sounding different on this CD you shouldn't be shocked as all his albums are unique in their own way."
3,Rather a disappointment after the previous three,"This is not a strong outing, it lacks the fit and finish of first three.Many of the people who worked on the two previous albums are absent. (I think they became level 42.) No tight core band is not compensated by stripped in Multi-tracking. A solid working band to record the basic tracks is ground work that makes for a more sure footed set of performances.While not without merit, it simply sounds like a set of home demos too much of the time that got released prematurely to satisfy a deadline set by Virgin and or he needed time to recharge and regroup.I have an early issue of this which doesn't include the last three songs.It is not the album to introduce the music of John Foxx to anyone, that distinction belongs to ""The Garden""."
2,awful album for a highly tallented singer / musician,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big John Foxx / Ultravox! fan, but this album was a real mistake in my opinion.The songs are just pathetic and Foxx's energy is not there, I think he was quite borred with music in the mid 80's.So, unless you're a John Foxx completist, just forget this album, it's really forgettable"
5,I love balls!!!!!,"This ball is as great as any I've ever had. I almost bought the blue one, but thought I'd get teased for having blue balls so got the All Blacks one instead. It's pretty nice. Standard for practicing, nothing extra special. It's better than I thought it would be though, especially for the price.The Amazon store I bought it from is fantastic, and I'll buy from them again with NO hesitation."
3,Decent holster,"This holster is exactly what it seems. There is nothing special about it, although there were supposed to be included instructions for adjusting the backstrap to fit different weapons which were missing. It is not obvious how this is done, fortunately if fit my Glock 17 without adjustment so I was not exactly concerned about it."
5,Good tool for many door hanging situations,"I've used this tool for several years. I am a remodeling and repair carpenter, so I don't do production hanging, and nearly always I am hanging a new door in an existing already hinged jamb. For these job conditions, this is an excellent tool. For production hanging, or for mortising already installed jambs, this may not the most efficient tool choice.That said, the tool is excellent. And, with external clamping, I've used it successfully in non-standard situations, such as hinging casement window sash."
4,better than sliced bread,"I have used this jig for the last 10 years or so and believe me it's better than sliced bread. RayB Marion, IN"
2,Dissappointing,After reading a lot about Invicta watches this was a let down.Could not read the time or get the crown out to adjust the time.Maybe one of their other watches will be better.
5,Hunter and Maui Approved!,"Both cats come running when they see the pink bag! This is the first ""treat"" that both my boys have liked."
5,My older cat loves these!,"These are a hit with my older female kitty. I used to get similar treats at the pet store, but either they don't carry them anymore, or PETCO charges about $7 per bag for a 2 oz bag! She LOVES these, and I like that they're healthy."
2,"""Challenging Knots""","I am a big fan of Budworth's knot books and when I saw a title of ""Challenging Knots"", I ordered it before it was released.The book is well put together, with gorgeous illustrations. Unfortunately, I've seen most of them before! It seems that this book is just ""The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots and Ropework"" on the SlimFast plan. The illustrations and text are nearly identical, though with much eliminated in this book.This is not a collection of ""Challenging Knots"", a book I'd really like to see Budworth write. It is instead another introductory knot book. I like it, but I liked ""Ultimate"", so I guess that makes sense. I look forward to Budworth writing a new book someday."
4,This is Part one of the mushrooms cultivation Bible.,"This book is not just any book, this covers the cultivation and propagation of the mushroom genome, If you want to know how to grow mushrooms, this is the place to start...!"
4,Good guide to learn the basics of cultivating mushrooms,"It is not easy to find a book that covers in simple terms how to grow mushrooms, this one does. It has all the relevant topics and covers the ""how To"" in a clear and easy to understand way. It covers in the exact level of detail a description of the most common species, that so sadly, as many other books, are named by their cientific denomination and not as we normally know them."
5,Mushroom paradise,"This book should be called the Mushroom Bible and Stamets and Chilton our saviors. Each chapter is very detailed, with the exception of the compost chapter. I'm not exactly sure what to do with it. However, this is a great book. Combined with a little internet research, a grower can be able to grow ANY type of mushroom in mass quantities!A great but and a great read!"
2,"""Practical"" is VERY misleading","I purchased this booking hoping to find basic information on growing mushrooms for culinary use. Instead I was overloaded with technical confusing information on the SCIENCE of growing fungus, NOT practical if all you want to know is how to grow your own ediable mushrooms. I was very disappointed."
5,Excellent Reference,This book is a excellent reference and guide for the intermediate to advanced mushroom grower. The emphasis is not necessarily on growing at home because the techniques described in the book require a pretty sophisticated lab. To grow mushrooms in the average kitchen with the dog walking by and shaking would be difficult using the info from this book. Of course if you buy the laminar flow hood from the author then things will be much easier for 800 dollars. The book is weak on sterile technique methods needed to sucessfully cultivate without laminar flow hoods.Overall the book is a very comprehensive outline for successful cultivation indoors and outdoors. I reccommend it
4,Suited mainly to bulk growers and experimenters,"A no-nonsense, fairly technical treatment of the subject. However, while it may make for dry reading, everything is easy to understand and a determined novice will not find himself lost. The book concentrates on bulk growing techniques, and the highly specialized, 'short-cut' methodologies that have become popular with some species are not in evidence. However, even a practitioner of such techniques might find this book useful for the growth parameters and the sections on trouble-shooting and disease. In case you were wondering, both edible mushrooms and interesting non-food species are covered in this work. I would warn, however, that the book may be dated and very limited with regards to it's treatment of individual strains. Overall, I'd recommend this work only to those interested in learning about bulk techniques or to determined experimenters wishing to have general technical data which they can work from or use to diagnose problems."
5,This is the best book I have found.,"Between both of paul's books, I have been unable to find anything even close. I consider this book to be the mushroom cultivation bible. I must agree with the statement above that it is written for a bigger cultivation operation than your bathroom. But there are so many differant scenarios for the home lever cultivator that there is no way a book could cover them. So Paul did what I believe he should have and wrote a book on the best way to grow mushrooms and left it up to us hobbyists to come as close as possible to achieving the optimum."
3,why is it taking so long for this book to ship?,"Why is it taking so long for this book to ship, huh? It was ordered on 7/19/12 and now it's 7/23/12 and it still hasn't shipped. What's up?????"
5,Love it!!!,I love this book! It helps me not only with mycelial propagation but with my yeast propagation techniques as well (primarily the slant/agar plate techniques).
2,Written for a Horticulture class,Definitely not written for someone looking to grow their own garden of mushrooms at home. I was just trying to grow shiake/portobello mushrooms at home and this book ended up as a coaster.
2,This book is anything but practical for a beginner,"I bought this book expecting it to help me, as a complete beginner learn how to grow mushrooms. The techniques used in this book are much too complicated for the average hobbyist. The investment of time and money required to grow your first mushrooms was startling and intimidating. I would not reccomend this book to any beginner."
2,TMI (Too Much Info),"I have never written a book review but I felt compelled to write this review.First off. There is a lot of information contained in this one book. The author is without a doubt probably the cutting edge scientist and expert on the subject of mushrooms.However, I am not playing in the same ballpark as this guy! I am only a college educated guy who has never grown a mushroom and wanted to learn how to do it at home. I have no interest in starting a mushroom growning business. If you have a room in your house to dedicate to mushroom growing, then this is the book for you. If you are like me and have never grown mushrooms and just want to know step by step how to grow your first mushrooms, then this is not the book for you."
4,A Beginners Bible to the Mushroom Cultivation,"Being my first book on mushroom cultivation (not to mention the mushroom industry), this book was really awesome. The book is quite technical yet easy to understand. The amount of information is just right for a beginner like me, to have an indepth understanding of mushrooms. It is a MUST read for all mushrooms enthusiast!"
3,not again...,"someone in the bone camp has a hard time with attributing albums. that layzie/bizzy ""bone brothers"" collabo was way more of a full bone thugs-n-harmony record than this is. everyone's already said it, but it bears repeating: this is krayzie bone (FEATURING bone thugs, at best). overall, the album's aite (except for that one track sampling christopher cross -- coulda done without that).it just would've been nice to know out the gate i was buying a krayzie album, and NOT the NEW BONE THUGS i've been patiently waiting for."
3,Mostly Krayzie Bone,"Most of it is previously unreleased songs. Really good, but should have been more of a group album.(...)"
4,good songs...no group. KRAYZIE BONE ALBUM,"NOT MUCH OF A GROUP EFFORT , this album was dominated by krayzie bone. All tracks were mainly krayzie solos. The group did apear on some tracks , but thats like 3. Not a new lp , just unreleased songs , to support their dvd. Not bad though."
3,"Vigor, Vim & Vitality","Dolly had a hard life growing up in the wilds of East Tennessee at the foot of the Smoky Mtns.; she started out poor and indeed did have a 'coat of many colors' as her children's book explained. She wore hand-me-downs in the backwoods of Sevier County where my paternal grandfather's people lived. She's funny. Coming from the country, it took some doing and lots of help to get where she is today. She has re-invented her personality through the years from the young lovesick girl who write 'I Will Always Love You' to Porter Wagoner. He gave her the first 'big' break, singing on his show in Nashville. She had been on local talent shows in Knox County, Cas Walker's for country music.Like most successful people, she has humility when it comes to feeling indebted to others for her success. She has talent galore, and I wish Dolly could live forever. She will in the figure on Sevier County Courthouse Lawn, as a young country girl. Dolly is everything to everybody."
2,Late arrival with no explanation,"Book and DVD's were fine but delivery was not. I ordered the items 2 weeks before Christmas and did not get it until December 28th. Estimated date on website said December 24th. Amazon even advertised on the home screen that ""orders placed today delivered on or before December 24th"".If I could have at least gotten an email notification that the items would be late, then I could cancel or buy another little gift to give in place of the late items. No information at all, just late items. My bad...I was hoping for the best and did not prepare for the worse. Now I wish I would have cancelled. Most orders from Amazon have been great...just don't take them for their word when they promise orders by December 24th. Go to the store and get something else, bring it home and wrap it up so it will be ready to give.... just in case Amazon can't live up to their ""Delivered by December 24th"" statement."
3,Songs Mislabeled,"Purchased the MP3 download version of this album. The songs were mislabeled and I had to manually change the name, track number, etc. This was a hassle but I no of no other way to correct it."
1,Bad CD,"The CD ""Truth is on its Way"" was very poorly produced. It would not play without skipping. None of the songs played the entire song. This was a poor purchase."
3,not what it seems,"this DVD has nice nature effects, ok music and rather goofy meditative voice. the real problem is that it is packaged as a DVD-Audio (super jewel box plus and two stickers on the shrink wrap that states it is a DVD-Audio). but when you open the package you find out IT IS NOT a DVD-Audio just a regular DVD in Dolby digital 5.1, not high-resolution. It has nothing to do with Amazon or the sellers. It was packaged this way. If you are looking for the high-resolution version of this or any others of the ""Elements"" or ""Directions"" series it does not exist!"
4,Envoking,"The music can protray a vivid and envoking experiance to the imagination, while the 4 sets of images can provide for a nice meditative focus. The added in guided meditation comes off as kind of cheesy, and would be better served by allowing the listener an idea of what it entails before they sit still for the half an hour to listen to the pre-recorded voice."
4,New Wave in HD,"Excellent 5.1 mixes but some tracks lose something that original stereo mixes had, especially in the lead vocals. For example, in Eyes Without A Face, Billy Idol's vocal sounds too naked and forward without the level of reverb and other studio effects found in the original. You can definitely realize the skill that went into the original recording to make Billy sound better. Same goes for Missing Persons ""Destination Unknown"". Otherwise this is a nice collection well worth your while!"
3,Good Start,"I have to admit I really like this book and its concept. (Eliminating the clutter, high ethics, ""showing up"", determining what matters most, etc.) However, I have to agree with another reviewer, ""money helps"". Not all of us (no matter how hard we try) will be able to achieve the wealth that Ms. Rocks has. I really don't think I could force myself to buy a $500 purse either, even if I had just won the lottery! As with most ""self help"" books, I would say we take the advice that works and leave the rest behind. What works for some will not always work for all."
5,A book that will speak to you,"This book is wonderful! I have told all my friends about it but won't let them borrow it because I plan on reading it again and again. I found myself shopping for no reason, my house much too cluttered and no time to get anything done. I knew I was ready to make a change and once I read this, I realize its not that hard. The book is advice on how to declutter your life and be good to yourself and your loved ones. It offers real life examples and lessons. It has become my bible. I strongly suggest this book to anyone who would like a little more organization in their life."
4,"Fabulous photos, but so-so text","The photos in this book are undoubtedly its strength. It may be worth buying this book just for the pictures. The problems with the text are as follows. First, it is obviously translated. It has been edited for correct English, but some of it still sounds awkward. The word usage often seems strange. I found a few errors, probably introduced by the translation/editing process. Second, it is not clear who it is written for. The vocabulary is probably too advanced for a non-scientist, but the information is nothing new for the specialist. Third, some of the information is too cursory to be of much value. For example, the chapter on diseases is very general; I don't think anyone would find the information here of much value.This book is worthwhile, but I would not consider it an essential reference work. Buy it for the photos, but don't expect the text to be excellent."
4,Its Average,Yeah.. I got it used. Its bigger than my old 128 meg card. I think it works slightly faster than my other one but my camera is really slow so i'm not really seeing a difference in performace. Its an average sd card that works.
4,"Great Drill, wrong specs","I needed this drill to make 3/4"" holes in a 16"" thick rebar'd concrete wall to run water pipe. so far, not a single hiccup. only thing i fault is that the description says 8.5 amps when the drill, by the ratings on the drill itself and the Bosch website are only 6.0amps. other than that, nice drill"
3,good drill for the money,"Bought this drill to install a hand rail on the in-law's porch...50 year old concrete...and had no intention of using a start drill for the holes. Altho the drill seems to get hot pretty quickly, given the angle that I had to be in to drill the holes, several breaks for ME were needed anyway."
4,WoW: A napkin folding book like no other!,"This book is the most fantastic napkin folding book I have ever seen. If you are interested in napkin folding, I would reccomend no other book higher for a beginner."
3,Statistics,"This book is written for PhD level students. It is not an easy read, even for someone who has had statistics before. I would not recommend this text to anyone except experienced statistics students."
3,Disk a DUD...,"I'm three chapters into this book and things are explained reasonably well although it is kind of dry like a pharmacology textbook. The thing I'm not happy about is the disk. It is a DUD unless you have a special program for running it (SPSS or other compatable program). Oh well, at least I only need it for the next 9 weeks of class."
3,Repetitive and Insightful,"Neither negative or positive, this book provides a repetitive but insightful view to statistics in research and the importance of proper and careful calculation and distribution."
5,PURCHASE REVIEW,"THE PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED IN THE ADD AND QUALITY WAS EXCELLENT, SHIPPING WAS DELAYED IT TOOK WEEKS TO GET THE PURCHASE, UNSURE OF WHY IT TOOK SO LONG, EMAILED SELLER ABOUT THE DELAY AND SELLER WAS TIMELY WITH COMMUNICATION"
4,Great for newbie nurse-researchers,This book is a great way for nurses to come to grips with statistical methods in a text that relates nursing concents to quantitative methods. The clinical examples ensure that the different statistical techniques are utilised to provide answers to relevant nursing/clinical research question. Easy to understand and very user-friendly.
3,Double skinned knee ouch!,If I didn't need it for a class...I would never have bought this.It hurts my soft-science brain to read.
1,verified buyer,"this book is a 93 page condensed version of a 296 page original book published in 1914 & 1916. It is full of typos, no page breaks, no illustrations. Nothing but type squeezed into 93 pages. The typos are disconcerting, it's barely readable. I'm returning my copy."
2,Munich Map is so-so,"I travel to Munich and a few other European capitals a few times a year -- I recently bought a bunch of the Streetwise Maps. The Munich one is rather weak -- it contains just the city center and leaves one in the dark about the suberbs, airport, and surrounding towns. Also it fails to include much the business areas and Olympic Stadium.The small U-bahn and S-bahn map is also cropped in a way that excludes many important places, this map would be good only for the day tourist to the city center."
1,"An awful, useless map","The people at Streetwise should be embarassed to even sell this map. Its poor design is EXTREME. I was so shocked at its terrible quality because OTHER Streetwise maps have always been so useful. Not this one. Streetwise Munich is missing a majority of Munich, it doesn't include an U-Bahn or S-Bahn plan, and is so difficult to read that you'll be more confused than aided by it. It is a total failure.This map does not live up to the Streetwise name. I don't recommend this product at all."
1,don't buy,Bought this and it crashed the laptop. Driver won't install properly. Can't contact manufacturer.
1,I wish Amazon had negative stars,I bought this hoping to upgrade to USB 2.0 and it hasn't work at all. I haven't been able to troubleshoot and thier website doesn't even support this product. It is supposed to come with a 3.5 disk that contains the driver but it wasn't included. Micro Inovations sucks. Be sure to check for support before you buy any product from them. Better yet don't buy anything from them and hopefully they will disappear.
1,doesn't work,It simply doesn't work after I had it installed. Should've read the reviews before I decide to buy it...
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I attempted to use this on a Compaq 2100 laptop to no avail. It has never worked, despite trouble-shooting to the best of my ability. Micro Innovations bites."
1,sure way to a crash,The device worked fine for two weeks then it made my laptop crash every time I had it inserted. Thank goodness removing the device brought me back. I spent hours trying the ideas from the Micro tech. Nothing helped. Its junk.
1,Trash. Don't waste your money.,"This card has NEVER worked. I've messed with it on and off for a month now and am finally throwing it away. As soon as I plug in a thumb drive the computer crashes with a blue screen.From my experience and looking at the other reviews, stay away from this junk. Don't throw away your money."
5,My new favorite swing band,"I buy a lot of swing CDs and this is the best one I've purchased in a long time! Cynthia's vocals are playful and sort of remind me of Ella Fitzgerald. The band definitely swings and I especially like the boogie woogie piano. The songs are really fun and even though they wrote most of them, the music still sounds like it's right out of the swing era. My dance partner and I have really enjoyed dancing to this CD but I also just love to listen to it. In fact, I've played it so much, that Cynthia and The Swing Set have become my new favorite swing band!"
5,Great Tex Morton CDs,"I am delighted with the CDs of Tex Morton. they are very hard to obtain in Australia, and are a nostalgic trip into the past andI am very greatful to receive them"
2,Trade Routes,"A political thriller; not much in the way of action at all. But if you're into some mind games, this is probably worth your time. Set in Bulgaria and the scenery is pleasing; definitely eastern European if Bulgaria is not the actual set. One or two actors are very good; the others average. The plot is shallow and simple enough, but has some twists that bring some unexpected turns.An election is reaching the end game and political forces clash in a mix of old school cold war intelligence games and western influence peddling. The down side is that America is once again played as the corrupt snake in the grass attempting to circumvent the ""free processes of an independent nation"". Though not a Hollywood flick, it's definitely of their mindset. A more interesting and realistic view would have been to actually incorporate historical forces that helped to make that nation what it is today. That may have been a bit too much work, however.2.5 - 3 stars."
3,A BRILLIANT WAY OF WRITING TO REACH KIDS OF TODAY,This book twists the old midevil legend of the Pied Piper. It is very interesting. I even enjoyed it and I'm almost 12 years old. Though it is much better when you have the author of the book there to read it to you (he came to my school today). I think sinse I enjoyed it it wiil be even more enjoyable for younger children.
2,Tales From the Neverending Story: The Beginning,"From the outset, this DVD was somewhat disappointing, despite some fantastic graphics and special effects. It appears to have been a hastily edited and heavily cut compilation of a series which was made for Canadian TV, with some disturbingly short and choppy segues from scene to scene, implying there was much extra material removed to edit this down to a film length feature. For continuity, I wish that the editors had allowed the original series to be transposed onto several DVDs and sold them as a complete set - it would have made more sense as a story, and allowed the original intent of the screenwriter and director to come through. Overall, though, it was a good try. Wait for the whole thing to be released, though - the bonus features hint at an amazing and entertaining multidisk story."
5,Useful tool for a variety of purposes,I have used this product for a variety of projects from cutting limbs off trees to sawing through nails. I particularly like the quick loading and releasing of the blade.
3,A complex plot expansively photographed,"3 of 5 stars for the gritty drama movie Body of Lies. The lead role is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who does a great job playing a deep undercover CIA spy in the middle east. The plot is rather complex and I don't think I could summarize it easily. The focus is on middle east terrorism and a couple of groups making plans. The movie was expansively photographed with a rich selection of locations. Since the story jumps from country to country (Jordan, Turkey, USA, etc) they did a nice job of giving a look to each place. There are some action scenes which are good. Some brutal torture scenes and a fair amount of blood. The movie seemed long and its pace slow at times. All-in-all, I did enjoy it and do recommend it."
2,boring,"The sort of movie you have to be in the mood for when you watch it. I kept thinking Ive seen it all before with the movie being twisted and twisted in an obvious effort to disguise the fact that the movie is based on the same old boring plot we've all seen before. Even the addition of top actors and a big budget couldn't save it from flopping. I felt a general lack of interest in what was going on throughout the movie but every now and then a LOUD in my face action sequence was thrown in just to shake me out of my daze. During the movie I ended up wanting Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) to Die, and for the movie to climatically end. To sum it up I found the Plot boring and a waste of two precious hours."
4,worth the rental price for sure,"great movie, and great performances by Crowe, Leonardo and Jordanian head of intelligence. There were a few very predictable parts of the story line, but overall a great movie with lots of intense action and dialogue. I wish the ending hadn't been so hollywood, but still very entertaining and great to watch."
4,Sleeper hit,"Probably one of the better movies I have seen this year, a real sleeper hit with no doubt. I didn't hear too much about it when it came out, but glad I picked it up."
5,Great Flick,"Good actors, great movie, and lots of action! Can watch many times over.Get a big tv with surrond sound for this movie."
4,KEEPS YOU ENGAGED,"LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT. IT KEPT US ENGAGED AND THE CHARACTERS WERE ORIGINAL, INTRIGUING, AND SYMPATHETIC. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED. Hope they do a sequel."
3,Body of Lies (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray],"Although the acting is great and the story compelling, I felt I had seen this movie once or twice before more or less. Oh that's right, I sawTraitor (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray],Syriana [Blu-ray],Spy Game [Blu-ray], and maybe a a couple others with parts of this movie in them. To be honest I'm getting tired of this story. If it wasn't for the great production values and acting I probably would have given it two stars because this plotline is getting old. If you liked this check out the other movies I mentioned above.CA Luster"
5,Body of Lies,"Leonardo and Russell are, not suprisingly, stellar in this complex and believable film. A must watch.jimmy"
2,You must be joking,"Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) plays a supposedly tough, know-all CIA agent, searching in Jordan for the master-mind of several particularly grisly terrorist attacks.Ferris' idiot boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) spends most of his time glued to a cell phone ear piece, while watching his kids eat Cheerios or play sports. Against Hoffman's advice, Ferris turns to the Jordanian intelligence chief for help in nailing the terrorist culprit, and nearly gets himself killed in the process.Alas, David Ignatius has created one of the most ridiculous Middle East story lines I've ever seen. But director Ridley Scott also did an awful job. The entire film is unconvincing."
2,Unfocused and weak for Ridley Scott,I had high hopes for this film. Any movie directed by Ridley Scott gets my attention. Unfortunately it didn't really leave me feeling satisfied. The plot just seemed ... incomplete. It's as if not enough happened.I think my problem is that the plot didn't give me a sense of importance and the characters didn't develop either. It failed to pull me in and give me some investment in what happens. Ultimately I just didn't care all that much. I give it 2 stars - it's worth a watch if you are bored.
3,How Much Punishment Can Leonardo Di Caprio Take?,"To reveal the answer to this question would spoil the film which probes the topic in digit-crunching detail! As a CIA agent in the field, the talented Di Caprio, plus the crystal-clear transfer of Blu-Ray, brings the pain a bit too close for comfort, as far as I am concerned. And Russell Crowe, as Di Caprio's boss, does nothing to relieve his agent's ongoing agony.If Ridley Scott's intention was to have Crowe portray the CIA chief of ops as both nerdy and callous, permanently attached to his cell-phone earpiece, issuing death-dealing orders from thousands of miles away without regard for the consequences, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams--precisely because of Crowe's own considerable talent. There is nothing to love about Crowe's character.As for Di Caprio, I spent far too much time feeling for him--in the worst possible way; and I didn't think that the story was suspenseful enough to make it worth the vicarious pain.Huge ""ouch factor""!"
3,"Enjoyable film, but please no more","I rented this film and was instantly hooked in. I could care less who stars, as the characters and story are what I truly look for. Ridley Scott does best what he's been doing the past couple of years, releasing okay movies. Yes, I though American Gangster and A Good Year were okay. I can never put Leo DiCaprio as an action star. No matter how much muscle he packs on, the guy still looks like he is in his early 20's. Russell Crowe plays Leo's lazy American boss who spends most of the time calling Leo his ""buddy"" and stuffing his face with food while showing no attention at all to his 2 small children. The action scenes were definately on par, but I am kinda finding the whole War in the Middle East back drop a bit tiring. Can they go somewhere else? What about fighting terrorists on the home front? There are way more dangerous people here than in the Middle East. Which is shown quite alot through this film. Overall, a pretty good film, could of been better."
3,Body of Familiarity,"Like some of the other three-star reviews here, I will note that the movie is actually not bad at all, it's just that we have seen it before, meaning, we have seen several films that are remarkably similar. The acting by Crowe and DiCaprio are excellent, and the story is mostly interesting, and at times, even plausible. There's just no originality to the story. Plus, I'm really tired of movies about bad guys in the Middle East."
1,Horrible war on terror propaganda,"this movie gives an extremely US-centric and therefore biased of not only the reality of the war on terror but also middle eastern culture and its people. If you want to be brainwashed, go ahead and buy or rent it. If you want something much more truthful, watch rendition or the valley of elah."
1,Waste of time,This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio is way overrated as an actor; and I can't say that I am fan of Russell Crowe. The story is the same garbage that only Hollywood knows how to waste time and money on. This film is not worth five stars. I am sorry that I had to give it at least one star.
4,Very good movie,"As always, Leo is excellent, contents interesting and entertaining.The plot is believable and suspenseful scenes are limited.We enjoyed this movie and would tell others to see it."
3,Got here fast!,"Mostly happy! Got here faster then i expected and the DVD was in great shape but some of the plastic on the top of the case was breaking. So the case is a little more flimsy and broken then i'd like for something i ordered in ""Good condition"" But other then that i guess i'm happy."
4,Stark and truthful,"I have become an admirer of Scott's work since Kingdom of heaven, and this movie is very good too.The thing I like about Scott is that he doesn't seem to take sides, there is no judgement against any of the characters in his films, he just seems to follow them with his camera.DiCaprio was good, but I think Crowe was far better.Say what you like about Russell Crowe, but he is the most interesting actor working today."
3,Moderately entertaining,I was looking for a fast-paced action movie and I found this one moderately entertaining but not one of the best in action films.
4,Thriller,"All I can say is that if you like actiona packed thriller movie where the main character is a spy, this is a movie for you. If you are a fan of ""Bourne"" movies, that you will definitely like this one.Set in exotic locations in the middle east, this is a story about young CIA agent who speaks fluent arabic and fights terrorist in an effort to eliminate their influential leader. Mix of cultural differences, bias and pretenion of a ""normal life"" of a CIA agent is the center of this movie.Leonardo DeCaprio and Russell Crowe give fantastic performance."
3,"SOLID FILM, BUT FORGETTABLE! 3 1/2 STARS!","I expected the most out of this film because it starred Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio and even though it is a good film, I found it to not live up to my expectations. The acting is very good and the plot is fairly easy to follow, but I found myself wanting a little more out of this story. I rate it 3 1/2 stars for it's good use of locations, good acting and an interesting story about what goes on outside our little comfort zone we live in. It's a good film, just not the best I've seen on the subject. I suggest you rent this before you buy it as I don't think I would watch this more than twice in a life time."
3,This BODY YIELDS some INTERESTING MOMENTS,"There are some good twists and suspenseful moments. Leonardo's acting is okay.There are also big logical holes. For example, Leonardo yelled and swore at the terrorist mastermind when he's going to be tortured. That won't happen in real life for sure.It's worth watching once."
2,Not impressed,"Previously impressed with all Ridley's works, this one? Hmmm. Could have watched ""The Unit"" on CBS and gotten the same result. Only with that TV series I would have at least experienced an appropriate ending. No wonder this movie had no ""press"" - it is definitely ""less than"" in many areas. First and foremost? No ending. All it accomplished was to further impress the fact there's dramatic problems in the middle east - that we have no real power over, and probably never will at the cost of too many american lives. If that was the reason for producing this movie, well, it was successful. As an entertainment piece? Nope. Am now proceeding to my Video On Demands and Amazon Unbox to delete this disappointing movie."
3,Another war-on-terror thriller,"This movie seems to be a issues after 911 .A spy-thriller Movie based on Middle eastern relationship with Western world .DiCaprio shines as usual . He speak clear and fluent arabic . Powerful performance by a fine actorthe movie is Based on the 2007 spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down an Al-Qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe).The movie is not fast paced movie . It is kind of slow and then catches it ...This is another war-on-terror thriller ,same old subject . I have given 3 star , nothing new in the movie except the powerful performace from DiCaprio"
3,Intense Leo.,"Enjoyable romp, if somewhat unbelieveable at times, hard to think the Jordanian secret service is more effective than the CIA, but may be it is! Russell Crowe is brilliant at the seedy off the wall CIA controller, Leo is a bit over the top and basically appears to be reprising his Blood Diamond role."
1,Two-Disc Edition?,"This review is not for the movie. The movie is fine and I am a fan of DiCaprio.One of the reason I ordered this...I would like to get the second disc, so I can watch some extra and behind the scenes. But what I get is a single disc version.I understand that with this price, I should be satisfied...however...if you are selling the one-disc version...do not say that you are selling the two-disc version.I have to give 1 star, as I am not getting what I am buying"
3,Certain performances stand out,"I've seen this movie several times and I was not able to figure out why until recently. It's not the best Ridley Scott movie, even though by now he should be very comfortable with Crowe. And he's certainly had enough experience making movies set in a middle eastern milieu, be it modern or medieval. No, what makes the movie work is Mark Strong as the chief of Jordanian security. He's got the accent down and he's got the upper-crust, middle eastern sense of superiority and entitlement down. A friend of mine who is Jordanian saw the movie ( he did not know who Strong was) and he told me that this actor was an Arab speaking english for this American made movie. When I told him Strong was an English actor, he couldn't believe it."
5,My reviews,Excellent movie with one of favorite actors. Already seen it of course and purchase was simply to add it to my collection. Shipper did a good job as well.Bob
5,Great Movie.,I really enjoyed viewing this film as I have always like spy films etc. Leo does a great job in the film.
1,Bad DVD --,"I love the movie, but this DVD is corrupted. This is the second one I have seen that the disc has been corrupted in this same way. Very poor quaity ---- not worth the money!"
4,Spy Movie,"This is a terrorism spy movie that shows both the analytical and operational side of intelligence gathering. Good performances by all, especially Mark Strong. It was odd seeing Crowe play a self-serving bureaucrat instead of a sacrificing hero, but he played it well and really got under your skin. I thought the romance part seemed a little obvious, but they didn't overdue it."
2,Leo Fan,I was disappointed with this movie. It is not the quality of movie that I am used to seeing Leonardo Dicaprio in. It was kind of hard to follow.
2,Confusing and rather boring and disappointing,"This is ""cool"" movie, good acting and everything, nice to see Leo Decaprio in this role, but overall the plot is rather dry and I was expecting a lot more. Really wanted to like the movie, but plot does not keep you interested for long.Visually nice looking film, but at the end, I wonder what the point of it all is."
2,big cast with stupid plot,"This movie was so unconvincing. A trained CIA agent entrusted to an independent operation in the middle east even overpowering the director in Jordan is acting like a hot-blooded rookie (a girl friend in enemy territory, come on, like ""hey, why don't you guys kidnap my girl friend to blackmail me!"" Muahahaha!!!), without calm, and without brains. The CIA boss played by Russell Crowe was a waste of talent as well. The role has no importance. Appearance and decision made were also unreasonable and unnecessary. Comparing to the Bourne series, this one is totally laughable."
1,Beware if you have a Sony BDP-S350,This rating is not for the movie but for the Blu Ray disc.Disc does not play on a Sony BDP-S350. I tried to 1) to play with a replacement disc from Blockbuster 2) Update to the latest firmware v019 of 4/23/2009. The disc still does not play.So far it is the only Blu Ray disc that does not play on my Sony.
5,Best poem book ever!,This is a great book for children. The pictures are GREAT! And the poems are wonderful. They really did a good job pulling this together.
3,Emmanuel,Only about 3 songs on the whole cd I really liked. Some songs went a little to far from the original version.
5,From a Student,"I had Dr. Keating for Morality class and we read through Pure Heart.... I found it to be extremely helpful in bringing complex ideas to a practical and personal level. In this book, Dr. Keating uses many personal experiences that we can relate to and that touch us in a special way. I would recommend this book to anyone desiring to begin to look at himself through different eyes and with a clearer heart."
2,Disappionted in Ohio,"yea, i have been getting alot of dvd concerts. and this one didn't impress me much. I guess i was expecting a better a better stage show with alittle more action. I dont think I'll even turn it on to my friends. they might get bored. Sorry : ("
3,Good start,"If you are a fan of Jason Aldean, you will enjoy this video. It is not a real high quality production, but it is good for a performer like Jason who is not yet a huge star. I think it is a good view of what a Jason Aldean concert is like and it shows he has a LOT of talent."
1,invicta watch,i purchased this watch to go with my collection. it never worked from the get go. i don't know why they put some ridicously high price on the watches then offer them for 10% of original cost. although the watch looked good it wouldn't keep time and that's what a watch should do.
5,Wonderful!!,"I'm a corrections officer and I've been through many watches...this is the only watch I've ever had that holds up to the abuse of my daily routine. There's still no scratches and it looks very nice with my uniform. I was skeptical at first since this is my first automatic watch, but it keeps the time and has never been a second behind. I'm very impressed with the looks, quality, and durability of this wonderful timepiece. And it's truly a steal at this price!! Also I know this is a mens watch but I'm a female and it's not huge and bulky looking as you would think but it's a nice size easy for the eyes to read day or night!!Very pleased!!"
4,Nice for the price.,"Definitely a solid watch, the band was a bit large for me, but then again I'm a smaller person however it was quite easy to adjust and only took a few minutesI've only had the watch a few weeks and will try to add to this in a few months or so to comment on the dependability of the watch over the long term.However with that being said it does a great job at keeping time. The watch went two + days without being worn or wound and still kept great time only losing about 2-3 minutes, which is really not that big of a dealThe movement is certainly no Rolex and could be smoother that is if you pay attention to detail, but then again the watch is not meant to be a Rolex.In the end as of now I would have no problem recommending this watch to a friend it's a good solid watch for everyday wear.If you're considering it, buy it.On a side note, I see no way to upgrade the warranty to the five year plan without spending I believe it was $30 that Invicta asked for just to serve as a heads up."
3,Worked Fine until the spindle thing broke,"This watch is a stunning looking watch when you take the price into effect. After wearing the watch for a while, I began to notice a rotary, spinning sound, and I'll be darned if it wasn't the watch's internal momentum time keeping mechanism. I thought this was cool at first, but then I began hearing it with every move I made and it just dug away at my nerves, until I could not wear it anymore. Then when I went back to wearing it, the (loss of technical term) spinner which changes the time and date just plum came out of the watch, and remarkably enough, it can be pushed/spun right back in. This seems highly odd to me. Overall a good watch to wear for a while and then switch. This is definitely not a full-time everyday watch."
5,Invicta 8926 Pro Diver - You can't go wrong with this watch!!!,"Automatic Diver watch for around $80? I could not have asked for more!The watch looks great. Obviously inspired by the iconic 1954 Rolex GMT Master, the design is very neat and appealing. The watch is about +-6 to 8 seconds accuracy per day. Which is not bad for this price range at all. If you can't live with that kind of accuracy, be prepared to spend at least couple of hundreds more.If you are planning to strap a NATO on this one, use a 20mm width strap. The measurements provided in the product description is not accurate. I bought a 22mm strap and it's too big.PS - I wish someone from Amazon would read this review and update the product measurements."
4,Pro Diver Review,"It's a nice watch. Good feel, nice looking, very good movement for the price. The only reason I'm giving the watch 4 stars instead of 5 is because the band is not built as well as the watch. Mine broke within the first week of use."
2,What customer service.,I emailed Invicta for advice in adjusting the watchband and was ignored. I bought the watch to use while snorkling and I got the automatic because I do not think the quartz watches are much different among brands except for the case and therefore not worth the premium price. I am sorry I bought an Invicta because the total lack of customer service.
1,didn't work,"This watch does not work for me after I bought everything to make it work, after several days I decided to take him to watch where I said it was dry, they had to wash the machine with oil, after that pay for q is fixed but would not recommend even now prefer not to buy these products or maybe I just had bad luck."
1,Broke after 2 months... :(,"The aesthetics and the apparent build quality is as good as people say here. However, my watch broke after 2 months. It stopped at 11:55pm, which means that the date mechanism broke. The Invicta warranty is horrendous - requiring a bank draft of ~$28 to pay for return shipping and I'll also have to pay to get the watch to the service centre. I've decided to just throw the watch away and not invest half of what I paid for it plus time and energy. Not sure if it is just this line of movements from Invicta as Costco carries the brand too. But this is the last time I'm buying an Invicta product."
1,Invicta Pro Diver,"INVICTA IS THE WORST AT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STANDING BEHIND THERE PRODUCT. I BOUGHT A PRO DIVER UNDER FULL WARRANTY, THE CROWN NEVER LOCKED (SCREWED) SHUT. I SENT IT BACK, AFTER TWO MONTHS THEY SENT ME BACK THE SAME EXACT WATCH WITH THE SAME DEFECT. THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME. TRULY A PIECE OF JUNK. STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Invicta watches are pure junk,"I recently purchased an Invicta watch for myself and the outside ring insert fell out. After talking to Tony at their taft street address in Hollywood, Florida, (which is by the way where I'm from), I was told I would have to pay 15.00 because it wasn't a warranty item. Now, I took the watch into the ocean for the first time and it filled up with water. And this is the ""pro diver"" version that is supposed to go to 660 feet? 6 feet and now it is a disposable item. And the watch is untouched from the factory...I've never had the back off. After what I went through with the bezel insert I don't even want to call them again. So let this review be a lesson to all of you potential buyers...poor quality and customer service equal a bad deal. I'm surprised that amazon is still carrying them."
3,Worth every penny,"2011 model, $350 original list. I bought it this month for under $90. It's so ""flashy"" (cheap looking)it looks better in the online image than on the wrist. I've only rotated the bezel a couple of times and the luminous dot has already popped off. Glad I didn't spend any more than I did on it. I wanted an automatic watch to wear daily to work, sea kayaking, fishing, and around town without worry or fuss. This may be ""it"". Time will tell how it holds up to the daily grind."
1,Keeping time would be nice,"My watch seems to run fast about 30 seconds to a minute every day, so after a week of wearing it is 5 minutes fast. Not very useful to me."
3,not for me,"The movement of this watch is great - nice smooth second hand sweep. However, the design is a little clunky for my tastes and it just didn't feel right. I returned it and will probably buy another Tag Heuer."
3,Information Disclosure,"One thing I think this sale did not mention is the movement. From the picture I have not clue whether it is swiss movement or japan movement. If it is a swiss movement, it is definitely a good deal."
1,does not hold up,I've had this watch for 1.5 years. the stem and crown came out while I was setting the time. so much for invicta quality!
1,"Watch is NOT 43mm, BE AWARE","Just received the watch today. It looks great, very nice looking watch, BUT BE AWARE, it is NOT 43mm, it's a very small watch, much smaller than Omega Seamaster or similar watches that are known for their size (43mm).I am returning mine today."
3,good looking,"Good looking watch but if you don't wear it enough each day, it's dead and must be reset. Battery watches for me from now on."
1,Not accurate for navigation,I've had 2 Invicta's for about 18 months. Good looking watch but... It's impossible to set / stop the second hand in order to sychronize it with the US Naval Observatory time. Just as bad it gains 5 minutes a week at a constant rate. This review applies to both of my Invictas.
2,6 Weeks Old & Leaking Water,"I actually bought the battery powered version but because I had already given it a review, it won't let me add another review. I have had the watch 6 weeks. It is now leaking. I saw moisture on the inside of the crystal and after closer inspection saw water rolling around inside of the watch. The warranty required me to send $25 shipping and insurance and it cost me another $10 for shipping and insurance to send it to Invicta. I have over $100 into the watch. I checked the pin and it was screwed down tight and I never took the back off as it came with a working battery. It is a great looking watch and the battery powered version I got kept great time. But, leaking water after 6 weeks is unacceptable. You might want to look elsewhere. And, I don't know if it's even going to be repaired properly."
5,Invicta - I love you!,This was fab. My husband raved about it. the quality was top notch at a truly affordable price. Need I say more? I am an invicta addict even if my last watch needed some servicing after purchase.
5,"great value, ok clasp",this is a great watch for the $$. the clasp is not the best but what do you expect for this price. i have managed to scratch the face but not bad. this is a mineral crystal not a saphire. look for the more expencive 9937 for a saphire crystal and a swiss movement.
1,Broken within 5 months!!!!,"The watch mechanism is great, but if you're looking for a watch that will last, including the watchband, then look elsewhere. My watchband (all stainless steel) broke at the end and a regular watch repair shop cannot fix it. It must be replaced, so I called/emailed Invicta and their response was that I can PAY for a replacement. The replacement fee was 20% of the MSRP of the watch, which is $255.00 on their website, not including shipping! The warranty that is supposed to be one-year only includes the interior mechanism of the watch. It doesn't include anything that is related to the exterior, including the watchband. I emailed several times to Invicta, and I never got an email reply back. I am extremely disappointed and I thought I was getting a great product that will last. Next time, maybe I should invest my money in something that has a REAL warranty with a real effective customer service department."
1,You get what you pay for.,I bought this watch for my sons graduation gift. It looked great but after only a week the band broke right at the bezel and had to be repaired by a professional for half the cost of the watch itself.
1,VERY UNSATISIFIED!!,"I have read reviews on this watch, most of them bad..but I gambled..and lost!I would not purchase this product, as it came out of the box with a cracked back, and ran very fast for the day I had it, before I sent it back.Amazon gave me a full refund,plus shipping expenses. I will purchase again from Amazon..but not this watch.Please read other reviews on this watch, but I would not purchase the Invicta brand again."
3,Great Watch but personal dislikes,"I received this watch about 2 days ago, it is a very nice watch and does look more expensive than the price paid for, my only complaint is that I received the 8926a model which from the pictures I've seen is a little bit different from the pictures of the watch I've seen on Amazon, small ingraving missing, nothing really, also personaly I dont really like the polished and brushed steel look on the watch band it does make it look cheaper a bit, but it is still a great watch for the value."
2,Good for 10 months,"I was really happy with this watch. But after 10 months or so..it never keeps time. The movement must be really cheap if overnight it stops. I 'm not going to wear it to bed. I've had to set it so much that now,the set cap is so lose it can become unscrewed and fall off. I would pass on all automatic's from Invicta if i were you."
3,Nice features for price,"Reviews were pretty good, price looked good, watch looked good, bought it. One month later, band scratches easily and badly leaving marks all over it just from sitting at a desk and using a keyboard. Accuracy is usually within 30 seconds a day but I think that is way to much, a couple of seconds I can live with but.........get what you pay for I guess!Update: Accuracy has improved to about 10 seconds a day. Think I will try, ( at my jewelers recommendation a nice leather band). This should make purchase very wothwhile as I really do love the look of this watch for the price. It is just the right size dial and the removal of the heavy SS band should make the weight just about right. My jeweler who has been in the business all his life states that it is a very nice and well made watch. Actually like it well enough to have bought a 2nd Invicta the 3751."
3,Looks great but keeps time poorly.,"Don't get me wrong, the watch is sexy. I've recieved a few compliments on it during the 1st week I wore it. The band's quality seems a little low and lightweight compared to the weight of the watch itself, but I got over it. The only real problem I have with it is that it runs fast. About a minute or more a day for me. It's a pain when I have to keep changing the time every few days just so its close."
5,Invicta S2,This is an impressively solid and good looking watch at a remarkable price. I'm definitely pleased with it.
2,Seconds pointer got loose inside the watch in 2 weeks,"I bought one of these 2 weeks ago I am wearing it and today, the indicator to the seconds, got loose inside the watch. Now I have to send it to repair. I was happy until today, but I am starting to think that this is regular junk. Juan Montalto, Costa Rica"
4,cool watch,"excellent value for the money....I got rid of my expensive Rolex, after 7 years of trying to get it to tell the time accurately and paying for expensive services. I have had the invicta automatic for around three weeks. Its solid, gains about a minute a week (less than the Rolex did!), which is okay for a self-winder. Its good to look at, comfortable on the wrist and secure with the strap...nice one!!"
4,Cool watch,"This watch is very durable and very nice. I've been using for 6 months now and it's great at keeping time. Sometimes I take it over for a whole day, and it still run great."
1,defective,I bought the dive watch for my trip to the great barrier reef. It arrived a few days before I left and the time was incorrect. I reset the time and the next day it was off again. I returned the watch.
2,i could look at it for hours...,"now.. this watch looks great but thats it.it will not be a dream come true and you will get what u pay 4.dont get me wrong,5 *s on the looks but keeps terible time and is built cheap.this coming from a 23 yo who owns 13 watches including 2 rolexes 4 tisots and a couple seikos.i know a lot about em'.so if looking for a cheap good looking thing to wear get this but if you want a good watch and u dont have 8 G's for a rolex a sieko will do just fine."
2,Makes a funny noise when you wear it,This is not battery operated. It is self winding. The self winding mechanism makes a metal clang each time your wrist moves. It was too annoying for me.
1,Awful,Just received this watch yesterday after much anticipation and OF COURSE it was delivered broken. After many unsuccessful tries at getting the automatic watch to start keeping time I finally gave up. I will be returning this watch for a full refund and will not be purchasing another one ever again. I am going to purchase a better quality one such as a swiss legend or something more reputable than invicta. Save yourself the trouble and stay away from this watch.
2,Good watch if you don't need to know what time it is.,"I really wanted to like the watch because it was self-winding, but my watch runs about 5 minutes fast for every week. So, after about a month, I'm really just guessing what time it is.It looks nice and does in fact wind itself, but the whole not being able to accurately keep track of time thing is a big let down."
2,Crown fell out after 5 months,"I really liked this watch - until the crown simply fell out after 5 months. I had a hard time pulling it out to set the date and time - something seemed to be wrong with whatever was holding it in.Anyway, one day I looked down and the crown was missing.Now I've got to ship it back to Invicta along with 20 bucks for shipping and handling (don't most manufacturers cover this??)"
3,Semi-Pleased,"I ordered this product because of the reviews and for the fact that is was automatic. It is a nice watch, however the self-winding is not as good as many other watches. This is partially made up for with the manual winding feature."
3,Great watch but dissapointed with Make of Movement,When I received this watch I was very excited and when I did some detailed visual observations I was dissapointed with Japanese movement. SInce Invicta is known as swiss watch I expected this watch to have Swiss movement. I owned this watch for couple of days and this is what I have to write right now. I will update the review as and when I find good/bad features.
4,Good for the price,"I purchased the Invicta Men's 8926 after a I'd heard about it from a few of my co-workers. I was looking for a mechanical watch with an automtic movement for regular daily use. While this watch is basically a knock-off of the Rolex Submariner, it is fine for the price (less than $70) and keeps time good enough for me. I have had to change the time only once since setting it the first time as it does advance a few minutes over a couple weeks or so. I wear it practically every day, so if it isn't worn as often this may be less of an issue."
3,Invicta pro diver watch is faster by 15 sec per day without adjustment,"I bought this watch around Nov, 2008. It looked good but the problem was that it's very inaccurate. It runs faster by 15 sec per day without adjustment. I took the watch off during the night and I noticed that it ran even faster during the time when I wasn't wearing it. I opened the case and adjusted the lever inside to try to slow down the movement. It took me several trials but I was finally able to get it to run only about 2 seconds faster per day. I don't recommend doing this yourself as it's very easy to damage the watch mechanisn, but without adjustment the watch is pretty much useless due to inaccuracy."
5,Jeweller approved.,"Took watch to a jeweller to shorten links in bracellet. He wanted to talk and showed me his ""mini collection"" of fake and copies of brand makes. He explained the many virtues and pitfalls, concluding that my Invicta was not only very well made but a bargain at the price I paid.The watch is heavier than I expected, but maybe that is a good thing. All in all, I'm very pleased with purchase."
4,Good for the price,"Shipping was on time, good.Quality is not I expected! otherwise no word on this item."
4,So far so good!,"After reading many of the reviews here, I decided to go ahead and make the purchase (with some trepidation). Well, after about a month of use, I am not having any problems with the watch. I really enjoy wearing it. For the price I paid (74.80 - shipped) it can't be beat. For my first Invicta, I'm pleasantly surprised. I will probably begin to buy more automatics because of this watch, not having to change a battery appeals to me, and the fact that it winds with the movement of your arm, makes it that much more ""green"". If you are considering this watch, don't hesitate to buy it, for the price, you can't go wrong, either for yourself, or as a gift."
4,The go-to watch,"The Invicta Diver 8926 is a bargin!!! I've been a fan of the Rolex Submariner for years, and this watch truely has that ""look"". Actually, I've had people ask me if it is the Rolex. I really am impressed with the quality. It is much more than I expected for a $100 AUTOMATIC watch and it looks, feels, and (sort-of) acts like a thousand dollar watch, or even almost like a $5000 Rolex Submariner. Ok, the only ""con"" I find about this watch is that it does run about a minute fast/ per week. It has the MIYOTA automatic mech.; the same that Citizen uses. It's not as accurate as a Swiss made watch but keep in mind, it is 1:10th the cost. If you dont mind it running slightly fast(and I do mean SLIGHTLY fast) this is the definition of ""bang for the buck"". I REALLY like this watch and wear it daily and it really does look and feel like a watch that should cost upwards of $500."
2,Foggy Lens,I went swimming with the watch on and the lens fogged up. I've only had the watch a few months. I'm going to try returning it.
1,It's so embarassing,"I bought two of this watch around 2009 Christmas when I was on a business trip in US (I'm from China) because the customer review rating was pretty high and it's cheap (67$ at that time) as a gift to my father and father-in-law. They were very happy when they got it because it's from US and it looked cool.But, in two weeks, I was told both of the watches didn't work well. Both of them ran 10+ minutes per day and steam came in easily when washing hands. They didn't wear it anymore.I'm so embarrassed. Actually, it's my first gift to my father-in-law ..."
4,I like this watch,"It looks like a Rolex Submariner, Costs under $100, and if it gets damaged or lost, who cares? The Bracelet is thick, The clasp is a little stiff as is the bezel. They break in with time (one month). I use the bezel daily for time hacks at work. This watch is a throwaway that looks very nice and is fairly comfortable to wear. (A little heavy, but ok) If you like to wear a nice watch but are afraid of getting it damaged or lost, this is a good buy. If nothing but the best will do, don't buy this. It's not that kind of watch."
5,Are you sure this is Invicta not Rolex,"Excellent and very classy watch. I wear it everyday and I have a dozen other watches that are more expensive. The mineral crystal is awesome, the Miyota movement is smooth, the clear back case is a nice touch - overall a great value considering how much watches are nowadays. I highly recommend this particular watch."
5,Great entry-level watch for those interested in purely mechanical timepieces,"My husband was looking for a good watch and, after a lot of research, settled on this one, which I bought him as one of his Christmas presents. He's pretty excited about it as it's the cheapest you can get for a decent fully mechanical, automatic winding watch. Hopefully this one will keep him interested for awhile, the price on mechanical watches apparently goes up steeply from here.One note: As others mention, the polished center of the bracelet links scratches easily, though unless you really bang it up the scratches are small enough not to be seen without close examination. Not a huge negative."
4,What's with the price?,"I bought this watch as a gift, and my brother really loved it. He's never owned an automatic watch before, so he was endlessly entertained by the window in the back which makes the movement visible (to be fair, my brother is very easily entertained... he does like Adam Sandler movies). Everything about this watch is great, it's big, but not comically big, it has a great weight to it, so that it feels like a really expensive piece.For some reason though, the price is constantly going up and down.When I bought it the price was in the low $80 range, as of now it's $94, but I've seen it dip down into the 70's. So, if you're buying this watch, and you can afford to wait a few months, keep checking and you could save 20% or more."
3,2+ years life,"I bought the 8926 in Dec. of 2006. It never kept accurate time. Lost over 2 mins a week. Finally, in late 2008, it stopped auto-winding and died overnite. I could wind it manually, but that isn't why I bought an auto watch. I like the style and design, but the dependability stinks. Going to try sending it to Invicta for repair but not hopeful."
5,Best Automatic for the Money,"I got the rubber band model of this watch 6 months ago and have worn it daily. Flawless performance and mistaken even for a Rolex. When my dress Tissot died (battery) I decided to get this model with the bracelet. It's very well made and works just like the Sport Model did, Flawlessly. Now I got to get me a winder! It's stupid to spend alot of money on a watch when Invicta has this kind of stuff available."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Received this watch and could not wait to get going. Read the manual and followed the instructions for getting it wound up. Started wearing it until bedtime when I noticed it had stopped running about 20 minutes after I initially wound it. Figured I may not have wound it correctly and went to sleep. The following morning I wound it up again, this time turning the crown twice as much as the manual recommends. By the time I got to work it was dead again which is when I decided to return it right away. From what I can tell dealing with Invicta to get it fixed would only cost more time and money, when it should of worked right when I got it! I may decide to order a new one because it really is a great looking watch!"
4,"Great Watch, Great Price","I've had probably 12 - 15 decent watches, but the Invicta Pro Diver has, by far, been the most reliable and attractive watch that I have owned. It's a must have."
5,incicta,"just recieved may 11 2012 and wore it all night,love the size and fit for the money yon can;t beat the price also it has 24 jewels would recommed this watch to all my friends WOW '''''' had no promblem also setting the watch if you have the right tools, the watch tool kit was a big help with the crown and taking links out,just ordered my secound 8926,wear the first one all the time,no promblems at all have five now would recommed the 8926 to all my freinds,your not going to find a good qualty watch for eighty dollars anywhere !!!!!!!!!!!!just got my third 8926 6-15-2012 love all three of them first one i have i wear all the time perfect time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good value,"I got this watch two years ago, and wanted to see how it held up prior to reviewing. If you can get by the concept of the wildly inflated MRSP (I defy anyone to say they found someone selling an Invicta at even close to the MRSP), it is an excellent watch for the value. It keeps excellent time, takes a beating, and the power reserve is very good. Based on the other reviews, I gather quality control makes this a slightly risky buy, but if you luck out as I did, you will like this watch.Update: It actually does work as a diving watch...I took it on a series of dives down to 120 feet, and it held up well. bumped it against the tanks and other hard objects a couple of times, and the crystal remained intact and unscratched."
3,Get what you pay for,"Just received this watch. The watch costs $80 so my expiration weren't high, but the watch itself seems pretty decent - especially considering its automatic.I am probably going to return it because the band is absolutely cheap garbage. The band actually squeeks, very very annoying! The band is made for cheap thin stainless. They should have put a better band on and charged $20 more. I may keep the watch if I can find a solid band, but I'm wondering if the overall watch quality if like the band."
3,"Nice watch, need the coin edge bezel","Was looking for an inexpensive automatic movement diver watch for daily use in and out of the water. Watch looks great and I love the size, not huge and clunky like most these days. I was surprised at the weight-substantial. The bezel has a scalloped edge which makes it hard to turn even with dry hands. Can't imagine how it could be done in the water. I am returning this one and have ordered the coin edge model."
4,"Great watch, needs to be regulated","Love the watch. It needs to be regulated as it runs a little fast. Looks good, fits well, no problems at all."
1,invicta men's 8926 pro diver automatic watch,Worse kinetic watch i've owned. You have to constantly motion the watch to keep it wound and running. leaving it to rest at night is enough to make it stop running by morning. Totally useless.
2,Very Unimpressed,"I purchased this watch because it had many of the features I value most: Stainless steel band, automatic, and versatile. It did not have a saphire crystal like the watch I was comparing it with, but I figured it was a good compromise to get an automatic. Within the first week of casual wear, there were multiple scratches on the crystal that were too deep for buffing. Very soon after, the bezel quit turning so I brought it in to be fixed. Now, three months after the first repair, the watch has quit working completely. Luckily it is under warranty and it has been shipped out for repair. Unfortunately I was told repairs typically take up to six months. Overall this watch has been very disappointing."
2,Very disappointing,"Unfortunately the gift wasn't used for a year so by the time it was taken out of the box, the warranty had expired. It does not keep time because it is automatic not a manual adjustment. I even took it to a jewelry store and they couldn't fix it I have bought a few other Invicta watches and have had good success."
2,Great looking watch but it can be uncomfortable.,"I did tons of research for a nice watch, I got this after all my research. The watch look great very nice but can be very uncomfortable.I was wearing it for 2 days and right after i put it on I feel the crow (the nob to change the time) on the top of my hand. The crown is very large that it was making a mark every time I had my hand down, this was after I got it sized for m hand. I have medium hans not sure if this might be the problem, but I had to return it. Good luck."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I got this watch for my boyfriend this Christmas.. It is a handsome, well priced and visually impressive piece. Nice weight and heft to it. Looks expensive. He was very impressed with it and concerned that I spent too much on him. He's a fan of dive watches and likes the Omega, but was pleased with the appearance of this watch, in fact, he indicated that he preferred this style to the much costier Omega.The only draw back... the presentation box is a hideous yellow and somewhat cheap looking, plus the box was all but destroyed when I got it... I had to ""punt"" and use the exterior box to present..."
5,My favorite,"I own a number of watches. Several are mechanical, including a Rolex, a Patek and a Panarai. Guess which watch I wear the most? The 8926 is a good-looking and reliable watch. Best of all, if you happen to lose or damage it, you can still live with yourself."
3,"Great jewlery, so-so timepiece","I have had this watch (8926) for over a year. It looks and feels fantastic and I'd give it a 5 as a piece of jewlery. I've received plenty of compliments. It is not that reliable however in the timekeeping department. I'd say that it runs 3 minutes a day slow and it stops running if it sits on a table for 12 or so hours. I tried using a watch winder (a machine that keeps rotating the watch) but the motion of the winder did not wind this particular watch at all. If I take it off when I get home from work, I have to reset it in the morning. I won't purchase another automatic watch. Quartz (battery operated) keep much better time in my opinion and you don't have to fool with them constantly. But...you get what you pay for, and at this price I'm not complaining too much. It is a good watch for the money, but it is not a good watch."
1,junk,"Watch showed up in unbroken package. NIB condition shipped direct from Amazon. When opened Watch appeared to be in excellent condition. Watch set up, and found to be defective. Second hand would stick in position at ""3"" with crown secured. With crown unsecured, second hand would make full sweep with slight hesitation around ""3"" position.I had read and seen positive reviews on this model, and decided to purchase. Let down. The overall quality of the watch appeared to be very good, less the defective movement. I have just purchased the 9927c model as a replacement, as I was happy with the construction of this model. Hopefully the Swiss movement does not fail to perform like this Japanese counterpart.e"
4,scratches,Unfortunately the band is made of low quality stainless steel that scratches easily. Other then that the watch keeps good time and watch components run smoothly.
2,HIT or MISS-- when you miss... you MISS BIG,"I bought two of these Invicta watches, one for me and one for my little brother.The only problem I had with my watch was the bracelet broke off-- but I was able to get it replaced. I've worn the watch ever since I got it, with minor time variances.HOWEVER, my little brother's watch did not work well from the start. At first, it was just off by a few minutes, which soon turned into hours. After a couple weeks, the winding mechanism began making grinding sounds when winding. Soon, the interior of the watch, under the glass began to condense with moisture and made it unreadable for periods of the day. In the end, this watch is sitting in the back of a drawer dead. We took the watch to a watch repair, and they were charging more than the cost of the watch to replace... and truthfully, I don't think I would by another one (even with the luck with mine)."
5,Fantastic Dive Watch,"I should qualify myself first. I am a Platinum Pro 5000 diver - one who has in excess of 5,000 dives. I also have an affinity for watches. My dive watches include a Rolex Submariner and a Rolex Sea Dweller. This Invicta is quite similar to the above Rolex watches (I hate to say it). I left this watch at the bottom of a 170' reef in Bonaire for 6 days and it held strong. I find the dial, hands and Cyclops rather easy to read. The bezel is a bit hard to turn, but I don't often use it anyway - that's why we have dive computers and god-given memory.I really like the watch - it has a good feel and the crystal is very clear. I paid $112.00 for my first one, and sold it to an island local divemaster. I am now buying a replacement.Although I'll still dive with my Rolex, I'll treasure this watch with the classics!"
5,Great watch at a great price,I was very pleased to find an automatic watch under $100. Was very surprised with the quality of the watch - will buy again!
5,One of the best dive watches ever.,"I'm sure I'm repeating praise, but this watch is everything a dive watch should be. Sturdy w/o being hefty, elegant w/o being stuffy, and man is it sharp!"
1,garbage,it stops working right as the Amazon return period expiresno one takes resposnibilityInvicta demands $25 plus postage both ways to even look at itGood luck funding someone to talk to
3,"Good looking, but not accurate at all.","My first auto-watch, not accurate at all as a Swiss watch. My one moves at least 30 second fast per day!!!!!What is the issue here? Have it exchanged? Again, at least 30 second fast per day. Is this caused by lower quality? Or, maybe the same issue with auto-watch?"
1,horrible experience- poor quality watch!!!!,"I bought this watch this summmer around $90, after 2 months, it stop working, this is the worst watch I have ever had. I need nearly one third of the watch price to mail the watch to invicta for repairing. so I don't wanna spend time to do this boring process. I wound never buy invicta watch. cheap price, but unreliable and poor quality watch!"
2,Always ahead of time...,Looks good...Feels good...But...Alway ahead of time...Approx. 6 mins. per month
2,Looks great. Doesn't run great.,"Get this watch for it's looks and price, not it's ability to keep time. Very well built. Looks like a much more expensive watch. Very solid. However, loses time each day and if you take it off for more than 8-10 hours, it will stop running and you will have to reset the date/time. My previous self-winding watch would run for a couple days without wearing it. Major disappointment that this one wouldn't."
4,Superior Watch. Invicta # 8926,"It looks, works, strong, waterproof and keeps the time like a Rolex.Thanks a lot. Super Fast Shipping, only Two days. I never received my first order and you sent me the second order without delay and without cost me a cent. You are number one Amazon, Ten Stars for You. You are my favorite store and the most trusted. God Bless You and Mrs. Mia R, for her courteous help to resolve my Inquire. Armando J. Perez"
4,Solid watch at a fair price.,"This watch has solid construction, classic look, is durable, and keeps good time. It's an excellent watch for the money."
4,"Solid Construction Nice Design, (Carefull with the Screw Down Crown)","Excellent watch.Buyers Read the Manual. Specially first page!!Mine started condensation after a month. NEVER LEFT THE CROWN OPEN.!!!""After setting the watch the crown must be then pushed and screwed back in tightly""."
2,"nice watch, questionable quality control",I received this watch and was pleased with its looks and performance for about eight days. It would not stay wound long enough to keep time after about the eighth day. I sent the watch in to be repaired and Invicta wanted $28.00 to have it repaired. I called the company and later learned that they had the purchase date for a older watch that I submitted for repair. I know they must have looked at the copy of the invoice I sent with the new watch because they knew I purchased it from Amazon.com. The billing department asked for another copy of the invoice and it was mailed the next day. I hope they will waive the charge as I think it unfair to have to pay more money for a watch that was obviously faulty to begin with. I will pay more attention to the conditions required for returns in the future.
2,"I really, really wanted to like this watch","I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is the first item I've ever returned to Amazon. Within 4 hours of setting this watch for the first time, it was already 3 minutes slow. The first night I slept with it on, I fell asleep around 11:45. When I woke up at 5 am, the watch had stopped at 12:15. Extremely stylish, though, and it has a very sturdy case."
3,"Nice appearance, poor quality control","I recently purchased this watch. It looked nice but I was settling for it because I did not want to spend 3 times as much on the one I wanted. With the reviews, I thought I might get a good one and be happy. The odds were against me.Pros:1) Solid build2) Looks neat from the back3) Clasp has a safety on it4) Bezel is painted with good stuffCons:1) Poor quality control. The automatic wind would not retain more than a minute. The manual wind achieved 4 minutes.2) The date lens is raised quite a bit and is not strong enough to justify having it. If it scratches, bad, it will be useless.Because of its height, it probably will scratch quickly.3) The clasp did not have a push button release so it will wear out more quickly than better clasps.4) The warranty service is poor and costs more than it is worth. Instead of getting it fixed right, I just returned it and willnot buy another Invicta again."
3,Watch keeps stopping,"I bought this watch for my son. He really likes it and wears it regularly but it stops keeping time while he is wearing it. He will shake it and it will start again, but only for a couple of minutes. We cant figure out what the problem is. Why wont it keep time while he is wearing it?"
5,Even Better than Expected,"I bought this watch a few months back to replace a Bulova Marine Star that had finally given out on me. I chose this as my ""everyday watch"". I had experience with another Invicta watch, but this was the first one I bought with a steel bracelet. I LOVE this watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the size and heft of the watch, which isn't that easy to see in the pictures. The automatic movement seems to keep excellent time.As noted in some other reviews, the polished sections of the link can scratch if this is your knock-around watch, but if you're an office worker like me that wears something else as a ""beater"", this is a fantastic option for daily office/casual wear. It looks great with anything. I have had several people ask me what brand it was, including a couple who asked if I was wearing a Rolex.I highly recommend this watch, and I will be buying another at some point."
5,exactly what i wanted,"I am so pleased with this watch. I haven't taken it off since i got it. When worn at a business meeting, numerous compliments. No problem wearing it working out, in the shower, playing tennis, etc. Then the value - it cost less, including shipping, than a theatre ticket. When you see it discounted; get it. Typical great Amazon service."
5,Good Value,"There's not much that hasn't already been written about the Invicta 8926. It came up at a sale price on Amazon recently and good reviews were plentiful and easy to find, making the decision to purchase quick and simple.This watch is widely described as being very good value for money, particularly if it can be had for under $100. This reviewer owns several watches, from classic and costly to near throw-away, and find myself reaching for the Invicta 8926 more often than other watches for day-to-day. As much as any single feature, look, or feel, that simple fact pretty much tells the story."
1,This product sucks,I bought 3 of these watches in 2009 as gifts. Two of them stopped working within one year and the other one is not accurate from the begining. I did not know if friends did not tell me. I wil never buy this brand again.
4,Great watch for the price,"The watch is as advertised. Not as heavy as I thought, but all is well, the fuctions are on point and apperence is great."
2,Great for the first year,"The clasp on the watchband broke after about 3 months and it was cheaper to fix it locally than send it back. I should have just thrown it away while I was ahead. Now after a year, the mainspring has broken. I would look for something different."
5,An absolutele fantastic value!,"I love this watch; the quality, looks, and performance are far beyond what I would expect for a watch at this price."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a frustrating watch. I like its looks, and wear it a lot, but it's a speed demon. Have had it into an Invicta authorized repair place twice and it still gains a minute a day. I have a similar model in blue and gold (I like to change watches now and then) and it keeps perfect time. I really want to stop using battery watches -- I travel a lot and worry about one giving up the ghost -- and will have to keep looking."
4,Fabulous Looking Watch for Large Hands/Wrists/People,"This is a beautiful watch. I have received many compliments. I took it to a jeweler and had 2 links removed for $5. I am a big guy - 6'3"" 250 lbs, and the thick heavy watch works well for me. I've seen some complaints about how big the watch is. Be on notice that if you are not large, this will probably not work for you.I also echo another reviewer's complaints about the horrible manual. Even for a watch this simple I had problems. It keeps changing days at noon instead of midnight. After some trial and error I figured it out but no thanks to Invicta.At any rate, it is nice looking, appears to be very durable, and I recommend it heartily."
5,extra link,"i purchased the same watch for my husband for Christmas. I ordered extra link on 1/5/07 from Invicta. It is now 2/19/07 and I have yet to receive the links. My husband is 6'7"" and has a large wrist. I call Invicta at least 2 times a week. The phone system is HORRIBLE... You keep going in circles and finally get a person who says "" it's on it's way from Switzerland."" Last week I was told that it is finally in UPS on it's way to me...we'll see!The watch itself is quite beautiful but the company is less than professional. I have contacted you about this problem before and was told there was nothing you could do. If you are going to sell a product you need to make sure the supplier is consumer friendly and helpful.I needed to know the circumference of the watch band but never was able to find it in your description."
1,This item is previously owned,"It arrived in new packaging, but the watch had scratches all over the metal band and the crystal was also scratched. I am very disappointed that this item did not mention it was refurbished or used previously. Beware of this when deciding to buy.Amazon did provide a refund for the item and even paid the return shipping, but it was an unneccessary ordeal that could have been prevented if the description was honest."
2,Buyer Beware!,"To keep it simple, this is a GREAT looking watch but if it breaks, good luck!! My husband wore this watch for less than 5 months and it broke. As another reviewer also stated, a regular watch repair shop was not able to fix it. We ended up having to pay $52 in shipping to get the repair done that was covered under warranty!! The watch had to be shipped by us to a US location. Once they received it they contacted us to say the repairs were covered but we had to pay the shipping and it needed to be fixed overseas :( so much for a warranty :( be cautious in purchasing this item."
5,Invicta 8926a,"Fantastic value for money would be the best way to describe this. Bang for your buck wise, it'd be hard pressed to be beatenVery close in appearance to a Rolex Submariner, but unique enough to want to show it off5 stars"
1,TERRIBLE PURCHASE,"I purchased this watch and it is my third Invicta watch, I was looking forward to the same kind of quality as my other watches. This is by far my worst purchase, I have had this watch for less than a week and it continues to stop, it keeps terrible time and I am going to return it and probably not purchase any more Invicta watches, at least the automatic ones. Very disappointed in Massachusetts"
5,"Strong watch, great value","I own the 9937 model dive watch by Invicta and bought this one as a daily beater watch. I love it. I wear it when I'm working on the car, or bathing my kids, or working at my lab. It works great, looks great, feels great. The 9937 feels a bit heavier, and is a bit more accurate, but for under $100 this is the best watch you will ever buy. It's a tough watch that will last you a long time. Buy it and you won't regret it."
1,Be weary of depth capability,"Took this 660' water resistant watch down 35' and came up to a fogged lens filled with condensation. The watch looks good, has a good weight but fails miserably to even come close to its claims. Spend the cash and get a watch worth your while."
1,repair service,"I recieved an Invicta watch last year in October. In July of this year it stopped working properly, sent it to Hollywood, FL (about an hour away from me). Today I called (9-22-2011) and it was sent overseas and will not be back til November???? I never want another Invicta watch, lousy customer service. I think since it was still under warranty they simply should have sent me a new watch....or maybe a loaner??? Shame on you Invicta...never again."
1,Why So Cheap? Fradulent Repairs Will Cost You.,"I figured out how Invicta can sell this automatic watch so cheaply - they can double their money with repairs. My automatic lasted 10 months when the band fell apart. I had to send a $28 money order with the watch even though it was under warranty. I was then told I had to send another $18 for a ""replacement"" band. Invicta sent my watch back with the old band. Their repair lasted 24 days when it fell apart again. Now Invicta wants another $30 for a ""replacement"" band. Invicta has doubled their money! I am filing a claim with the CA Department of Consumer Affairs."
2,Band broke in less then 1 week,Band broke and came apart in less then one week.The movement looks good but was disappointed with the band breaking.Very disappointed.
3,good,the watch is good. But it is too big for me. My wrist is not so thick. So I will give this one to my friend. I sugggest taht you should think about all of the customers. A LOT OF young people do not have a thick wrist. I want to buy a watch which is little than this.
2,Beware,I bought this watch 6 months ago and decided to take it into the pool. The watch got water inside the face. I was dissapointed because it is a divers watch. I called invicta for warranty service. Invicta requires a check for $28.00 so they can ship it overseas for repair. I only paid $100.00 from amazon. So I have to pay 33 pct of the purchase price so they can ship it to be repaired under warranty.
4,Good for looks OK for accuracy,"This is a solid great looking watch. If you don't know better and know a little about watches, the deal of the decade. I have had two Rolodex owners ask me if this is the new model.Don't rely on this watch to be 30+/- sec. per day, mine runs fast. With that said, it is still a great watch that I enjoy as a daily ware."
4,good price and right watch for me,I like this watch because I do not need to warry about battery change every two years. It has really cool clasic look and it's fairly accurate.
1,Not reliable; stops for some reason at 9:51 .. frustrating,This is a cheap watch .. you get what you for. YMMV but mine stops every day or every other day and I to reset the time to get it going again. It's build quality is very good and appointments are beautiful. It's a shame the operational performance is not as good.
1,don't waist your time.,"first one movement died,second one band broke,jeweler couldn't fix it.looks good but it doesn't work.i should've listen to other people. the exact thing happened to me.a hassle to send them back and money to pay for band adjustments,i'd purchase both many different models for men and women from invicta.they are all disappointments.but bearing a Swiss designed.japen movement.i'm sacrificing my time writing this so you don't have to waist you time."
1,Broken in box,"I was excited when my watch arrived. However when I opened the case I discovered the hands must had fallen off in transit. If the hands can't last in a protective box, then how long will they last on my wrist? I have read other peoples reviews where the hands have fallen off in a few days or months. I have a work colleague who has one and it seems fine. I guess Invicta must have a build quality issue ...some are good, others not so good.I sent the box back and Amazon refunded my money... now the search continues for another watch, but not an Invicta!"
1,Invicta watch doesn't work,"On January 4 ,2011 I bought a new Invicta Men's 8926 Pro Diver Collection Automatic Watch for $82.54 pl S&H. I had trouble setting the watch the first day but finally got it done. Two days later the watch displayed the wrong date so I reset it.All was well for about a week and then the watch lost three hours in one day. I reset it again and all went well till last week and then the date was off over an hour in one day and the watch lost 8 1/2 hours in 24 hours. I'm still trying to find out who and how to contact someone to get the watch replaced."
1,"nice case, but rest of it seems flimsy","I had this watch a little over 2 days and I already am having problems with the screw down crown(won't screw down) which kind ruins water resistance, case itself seems solid watch is fairly accurate. I only have one other invicta I am starting to question their quality thankfully I only paid 60$ I don't really expect the same quality or accuracy as a more expensive watch but I don't expect things to start start acting up this early, checked the warranty, 25$ shipping and handling, hardly worth repairing, oh well lesson learned."
1,Fell Apart in Two Weeks - Not Recommended,"Within two weeks, a pin in the watch band came apart. It took 5 attempts to reach someone in customer service. I waited 4 weeks and was shipped the wrong part. I contacted the company again and was told to mail the watch to the company (at my expense) and, despite the watch being under warranty, I was to send the company a $20 money order to cover shipping and handling for the return of the watch once it was repaired. So what did I buy? A defective watch that they'll gladly repair under warranty at MY expense (I'm guessing the pin costs 50 cents, but they wouldn't send it to me and it isn't the type normally found on most watch bands or I'd replace it myself). I think I'll pass and write this one off to bad judgment.In addition, the watch stops if not worn for a day.Oh well, I guess one only can expect to get what one pays for. I should have played it safe and bought a higher quality watch for a bit more money. Live and learn."
1,Invicta Warranty,After 6 weeks this watch started to malfunction. Called Invicta to inquire about the warranty to learn that a check for $35.00 must accompany the watch to obtain service. Ridiculous to pay such an amount on a $99.00 watch after 6 weeks. I shipped it back to Amazon and while I was penalized 20% for a return made after 30 days of purchase I am happy to be rid of it. I would not purchase this brand.
1,disappointed,we were very disappointed by this watch. It stopped working almost imediatly. and went to repair atleast 2 more times.
1,Buy another watch!!!!!,"Great looking watch, no doubt. But, I can't get use to having to set the date and time each time I put it on. I can wear the watch all day, take it off when I go to bed, get up in the morning and the watch always seems to quit running before the date change at midnight. Bought an automatic winder which didn't help. I still have to set the time each morning when I put the watch on. I definitely wish I would have bought the quartz model or maybe a different watch.UPDATE!!!Now January 2012, less than a year after purchase the watch quit working properly. The second hand stops whenever it reaches the date and does not start up unless the watch is shaken. Definitely would not recommend this watch. Cost too much to send for repairs compared to the original price so, I now have a nice looking paperweight."
3,Nice watch but fast,"I have owned the Invicta 8926 watch for about two Months now. The watch is averaging about one minute a week fast. This is no problem if you do not wear the watch everyday. If not worn for one day, IT STOPS!! Will be shopping for a better watch....Quartz. The 8926 is sturdy, but yet stylish enough to wear for everyday use."
2,Looks good but you get what you pay for,"I bought this watch for its look and price. Overall, I had been very happy with the look and feel of it for the value. However after just 6 weeks, I have several concerns. First, the clasp on the watch broke without any significant impact. What's frustrating is that I won't send it back because the warranty requires additional shipping and handling charges for this defective part. Another concern is that the watch does run fast (about 5 minutes per week or two). I have had to reset it frequently and cannot use it for work because it is not consistently accurate. Lastly, you must wear it daily or the watch will stop fairly quickly. Overall, it has not lived up to what I expected and I am very dissappointed in the warranty coverage. Any product that is broken this quickly should be fixed without charge or hassle."
5,Never would have bought BUT......,One of my friends had this watch for three years and its great. He paid $100 and that was a great deal. So when I found it for $65 I thought I scored and I did I LOVE IT!!! and I have never wrote a review before
1,Invicta's shipping and handling a Rip-Off,"Eagerly purchased to 8926 for only $95.00. It looks and feels like a much more expensive watch. It runs pretty fast, about 3 or 4 minutes a week. After wearing it for only six weeks, a link in the band keeps popping out. Invicta wants over 20% of the purchase price for shipping even though its only a few bucks via UPS. You truly get what you pay for."
2,MIne is slow by 2 minutes a day.,I agree with all the others who say the watch looks nice. I like the heft to it too and love that mechanical watch half second step. Its too bad the watch is slow by 2 minutes a day. Its at least consistent in its 2 min loss. I'll never buy another Invicta again though.
3,recharges through movement,"This watch contains a rechargeable battery that recharges through the movement of the wearers wrist, meaning that as long as you wear the watch, the battery does not die out. Although should you decide not to wear it every day, the battery is able to hold a charge that lasts for about six months."
2,It does not run accurately.,"The price is good, however, it does not run accurately. It runs about 5 minutes faster in one week."
5,satisfied with 8926,"I have had this watch for over a month now. So far so good it keeps good time, within a minute a day, and seems to be constructed very well. I would recommend this to someone that wants a good quality watch at a great price."
3,Can buy them at Sam's Club,"Great price, so I bought it. The watch does require time adjustment even when worn. Sam's club carries them at the same price."
3,not for those without a watch winder,Although this watch looks very nice it doesn't take long before it stops moving. So if you're one who doesn't like to sleep with a watch on I would look for another...I was impressed with the way it looked though. As well as the way it was packaged.
5,Fantastic deal!,This is a highly recommended dive watch. Look for reviews online - the 8926 is almost always in there.......the Amazon price was so good I bought 2. One will be a gift for a family member.
5,"A very solid, workhorse of a watch.","This was my first Invicta watch. I'm very familiar with the Citizen/Miyota automatic movements and again they have proven to be very reliable. The watch itself has a nice solid feel and has a good weight to it. Detail work is nice. I wish the band had the diver extension link, but its not a must have feature. This is my ""everyday"" watch and as such it has taken a few knocks. The crystal holds up very well with no signs of scratching. The band has some marks in it, but its stainless and is to be expected. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Take care of it and have the automatic movement serviced yearly and it will last you for a long time."
5,Rolex Submariner type watch for $80 instead of $5000+,"Saw my brother wearing a similiar Invicta model watch at family get together and thought he bought a Rolex. Was blown away by the quality of his watch / affordable price tag & wanted find out how to buy one.His watch was a little larger than the 8926C. I think his was 47mm in diameter where as the 8926C is 40mm.Anyways, got the watch, love it and enjoy wearing it every day !!!It does run a little fast ( so far about 20 seconds / day or about 10 minutes per month )....but I hear mechanical movement watches are not always precise and may take a few months to snchronize.Buy an Invicta !!! You will love it !"
5,EXCELLENT WATCH FOR THE PRICE,"Not only is this watch full of great features and functions, it also looks terrific on my wrist. As others have stated, I expected it to be priced at least $100 higher. A remarkable and utilitarian timepiece at a stellar price. Go ahead -- shop around. I sincerely doubt that you will find a better bargain."
1,Total piece of C**P,"I purchased this watch from Amazon in October 2006. I was really impressed at first with the look of the watch and impressive packaging! The watch looked great. Only problem was the watch was consistently slow by about 5 minutes. This required resetting the time every 3 weeks or so. A pin in the ban failed and I had to have it replaced in year 1. Then, after owning the watch for 2 years, it died on me. Dead. This ultimate fate of my Invicta was the garbage can in 2008. Maybe some archeologist 1000 years from now that finds it can get it to work."
3,Not a good timepiece,"This is a very attractive watch, especially for the price, but it continually runs fast. Each day it picks up a minute, so I'm constantly resetting the time. It's very frustrating, and I wish I had not bought this watch."
2,Solid Good looking Defective Watch,"WOW ! This thing is really Good Looking. Solid feel. Only one problem , after 3 hours and 20 minutes it flat out stopped ! All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't get the watch started again. To top it off I returned it to Amazon and they didn't even issue a full refund. I didn't put the link back in the band ,although I did return it with the watch. I figured that being as it was defective they couldn't resell it anyway. What difference could it make? About $4.50 as it turns out. Makes me totally rethink buying anything other than media from Amazon."
2,"Normal looking, but become 1 minute faster every day.",I can't bear to adjust it every a few days. Is my watch the only one has this issue? This is the most inaccurate watch I've ever used.
1,Mine was broken straight from the box,"I'd have to rate their quality control poor to bad. Mine came and after I wound it up ran for 5 minutes and quit. The second hand stuck at about the 20 minute mark and that was it. No amount of winding, shaking gently would unstick it, so back it went.Oh yeah about the pins, before I wore it I took it to a jeweler to size it and they bent one of the pins getting it out and back in. They appear to be too light gauge wire for the job.Anyway, back it went and since it was DOA, the return was not an issue. But I won't be buying another invicta anything."
1,Terrible quality,"Tightened the device for the first time and the connector broke. It seems that the material used is too flimsy for the job. My advice?, stay clear off this device, look for another make."
5,Battery switch,"Yes, I'm satisfied with it and believe that this is a good product to have on your vehicles. I put it on right away because I was un-screwing the cable from my battery because I have a digital radio. If you have digital clocks or radios in or on your transposition, the battery runs down or even goes dead, like mine did."
1,Terrible,"In the description, it says non-greasy. What a joke. It is totally greasy. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you will be washing your hair right after you put it in! It was a waste of my money. Also, it does not smell good either."
2,"I thought it was good in the beginning, then........","I started to realize that this stuff is making my daughters hair look very dry and brittle. I don't understand why, but it did. It also looked like her hair was stunted. Almost as if it didn't want to grow and shine anymore. It was the weirdest thing, because i really wanted this stuff to work. Especially becuz of that high price. So I tryed it a couple of times and each time i was hating the way my daughters hair was starting to look. Very dry and made her curls look crunchy and shortend her hair length to tight dry curls that look like they want to break. But it does make the hair easier to comb, which is weird. I dunno. It didn't work for me anymore. This item is waaaay over priced for the things it DON'T do."
1,Too Oily,I have natural 4a hair that tends to be really dry and tangled all the time. this left my hair too oily and the smell was too over powering. i had to store it in a refrigerator cos it melts at room temperature. i will not be purchasing this again
5,Nice Piece!,"I realize this is heresy but I'm not the biggest Milwaukee fan. However, the reviews on this thing were great and I decided to take a chance. Love it. Balance, guide, power, cord, everything is absolutely perfect. Feel good every time I go to pick it up. Worth the bucks.Update 9/10/11: I've used this thing at least once a week since I got it. Absolutely the best, I feel good every time I drag it out of the garage. If you use a circular saw, get this one, even if your current one seems okay because, trust me, it won't seem okay after using this one!"
2,Noisy,"I like this unit EXCEPT the DVD rotating creates an annoyingly loud rumbly, vibrating noise. Perhaps I just got a bad unit, but this one is on its way back to Target."
2,"Polaroid 7"" portable DVD Player-Red (PDX-0073)","I purchased this DVD player for a road trip. I charged it for the trip the night before we left. It played just fine for the 5hrs we were on the road. I tried to charge the battery again before we left for home, but the AC adapter did not work so we could not charge it. We used the adapter for the cigarette lighter and that worked for the ride home. I did return it to Target. I'm still searching for the perfect player. Maybe this a just a fluke."
4,Good bargain for the money,"After reviewing a few other brands that were not as nicely priced I purchased the Tekpower model and am now really enjoying its wide range of features. Reads out two decmil points which I needed for electronic research and even has a temp sensor. Would not hesitate to recommend this product. The only thing I would change is make the shell more durable. Might not last as long as a fluke in the bottom of a tool bag or being dropped. But all in all, well worth the money."
1,everythig it is half with multimeter,"I bought this multimetere...i was happy when receveid the DT9602R...but now i very angry.everything what i will try to check it's half:- the power line 220V, the multimeter show 122V-the power line 110V, the multimeter show 66V- the battery 9V (new one) 4.86V, i tried 3 batteries, also the battery the battery wich the multimetr comes.also iti is very difficult to measurament the temperature...you have to wait to much.relly i dont't know what's happend......"
1,What is the input impedance?,"It may be a wonderful instrument, but the on-line specifications are not sufficient to know whether I could use it for my intended purpose.I want an instrument that I can use for vacuum tube circuits. Because of the high resistances used with vacuum circuits, if a volt meter draws significant current, it will disturb the circuit making it impossible to get accurate readings. That is why traditionally vacuum tube voltmeters (VTVMs) were used with vacuum tube circuits.It may be that this instruments has a high enough input impedance, but it is impossible to tell from the on-line specifications. Because the information is inadequate, I have given it a 1-star rating."
1,Do not buy this book unless you speak French.,Terrible book with no prounciation of any phrases WHATSOEVER! It really makes me mad when people write phoney reviews. I also purchased the Berlitz French Phrasebook so that my husband and I would not have to share a phrasebook. I would suggest it because the Lonely Planet Phrasebook is useless unless you already speak French.It would cost me more time and money to return the book than it is worth.
4,Excellent Book&#65533;IF you have any prior knowledge of French,"I found this book to be very helpful, but only if you've taken a French class before and know basic vocabulary and pronunciation. I don't think it will prove as helpful to someone with no background in French, unless maybe they study and practice it before going to France.I found the sections on socializing very thorough and useful, but I wish that there had been more about the public transportation system. Overall, a useful guide if you want to talk to locals, who are so much nicer to you if you attempt to speak French, even if your accent isn't that great."
1,Needed book for class,This book is nothing but lines on paper. It's way too expensive for what it is. I only bought it because it was manditory for a class.
2,Great series with average quality of bluray,"Pic 2.5/5..., it's bluray disc with DVD quality format. So many noisesSounds 4/5Story 5/5... Bring back season 6 pls!!!!"
5,Chuck season 5,"""Chuck"" should have never been cancelled! Glad we can order episodes to continue the enjoyment. Sent it to my daughter's and will pick it up our next trip after they have watched it. Prime membership assured quick delivery for their enjoyment. Thank-you."
5,great but beware,brilliant series but beware the money grabbing toss pots at customs charged me 13 quid to recieve this what a pain in the behind all tese celebs and buisness men ripping off their taxes with legal loopholes and they hound me for this.....ordering something not available in the uk ....in one word c.u.n.t.s
3,Please Tell me there will be an extended version of the Series Finale,That ending was not worthy of such a GREAT show. Sarah and Chuck deserved better. I'm seriously considering not buying the season 5 DVD set. An extended finale may be the only thing that saves it for me. Come on Chuck don't let me and other loyal fans down. I gave it 3 stars out of loyality.
3,Chuck Season 5,"it lived up to my expectations. the previous seasons were better, but it's still a good show. price was good and shipping came on-time."
5,good deal,I got a great price and it showed up on time. The packaging was intact and proper size for the dvds.
5,Chuck: The last season,"Only way to see season 5 as Chuck was not rerun on NBC. Now I can watch whenever I want to see a little Nerd Herd action! Actually, great package and was happy to add it to my collection. Chuck was one of my favorite series...sorry to see it end."
2,Horrible Picture!!,"This review is not about ""Chuck"". I love the show. But the quality of the picture on the standard DVD is horrible. I've got 20 year old VHS tapes that look better than this. I have all five seasons on DVD and this is the worst, to the point where it's distracting while watching. Previous seasons came with a minimum of 4 disc and as many as 6, this only has 3 which means they had to compress the video more to get it on fewer discs. I wasn't happy when the ended my favorite show, now I feel like they twisted the knife in me as a final farewell."
1,A Horrible End to a Great Series,"After four great seasons and an incredibly uplifiting end to season 4, the writers totally dissed their fans and created a depressing and outrageous fifth season. The series 2-part finale went against everything the series had built up over four years. Each episode, from Morgan's ridiculous use of the Intersect to the final outlandish villain, reeked of the writers' antipathy to the characters. I will always think of the last episode of season four as the real series finale."
1,my first review...,"I have never posted a review on amazon, at least that I can remember, but did so with chuck because of how much I hated this show. I thought the acting was forced, his stammering geekiness was a shameless rip off of ""Jim"" from the office and ""Seth"" off the O.C. The pilot was not exciting at all, and the female lead looked like a rabbit crossed with Naomi Watts. It was trying too hard to be funny and original, and it just came off as stale."
4,A good ending to a great show,"If you have followed this program through it's ups and downs, twists and turns; and waited, as I did for Chuck and Sarah to make it real this is a fitting ending to all that. I didn't give it 5 stars cause there were some things in there that didn't wrap things up exactly the way I felt it should wrap and that is a purely personal reaction - others may feel it was perfectly done. It was an uneven season but nevertheless I always felt good after watching it and that is, or was I think, the key to this show. It had heart, and humor and romance and intrigue and I loved it all."
5,Best show in a long time,"Not only is Zac very attractive, the fact that they blend geek humor with spy stuff is awesome. I miss this show having new episodes, but I am glad I have all the Sedona in DVD."
5,Big fan,I love this series and am delighted that I can watch as often as I want now. I enjoy listening to these shows as much as I do watching them
3,Chuck Final Season Disappoints,Only about half the episodes of previous seasons and the storyline goes south to the point that it is obvious even to the audience that this show is out of new ideas. Toss on an ambiguous ending and it seals the average rating.
5,"Great Show, Worst Last Episode.","One of my favorite TV series of all time. The last episode made me feel like my heart was ripped out. It left you with an empty feeling. The truth is that there is no doubt the series has come to an end. Not the ending I would have wished for in a million years, but yes the CHUCK series is now completed. This is very sad..."
3,What happened?,What happened? It was a cute series the first few years. Either the writer or producer had a brain freeze in the final year. And the ending was even worse.
3,Hmmm................,Not really impressed with anything about the final season. They were trying to kick it out the door. Thats it
2,worst of the entire series,"We loved the Chuck series and were really looking forward to this final season. But our hopes were dashed by the disappointing storyline. We felt sorry for the actors! I purchased it to complete the set for a son, but I won't watch this series again."
5,best thing in a long time,"This was a real surprise. I caught the pilot rerun on Saturday, and then saw ""Chuck and the Helicopter"" on Monday. I was so impressed with the characters and writing that I called friends to ask them to watch. Levi is a wonderful, expressive actor, and the rest of the cast all work together well. I hope the show is around for a long while."
1,stina nordenstam rip-off,"it irritated me how much everything about this CD was stina nordenstam-ish. the only semi-good song is 'stay tuned'. i ADORE good music and can normally find SOMETHING to appreciate in almost any cd, but this was not worth my coinage.:("
1,Buy at your own risk,"I purchased this pressure cooker approximately 7 months ago. When I recently went to use it (after many successful and enjoyable occaisons) I found the pot had cracked about 8 times in a vertical fashion around the lip. I have since found out that the maker (Innova) is not longer in business and the company that has taken over their product line (Kinetic) will not honor the 3 year warranty--in fact, they have not responded to any commnications I have tried. It appears I will have to chalk this wasted $100+ to experience and try to buy another pressure cooker from a more reliable company."
2,Attention to detail,"I had thought to get my daughter paper dolls like the ones I had so much fun with as a child (and still have them, since I took care of them). However, the punchouts don't even fit the dolls or hang on them properly! Several of Ken's costumes don't fit (are too short or something else wrong) and Barbie's outfits don't fit well either (the mermaid top doesn't cover her undergarments on the body). The only good thing I can say is that I don't mind if the dolls and outfits get roughed up, since they can't be any worse!"
4,back in the day,"In the days of early fusion few pioneers were as capable as Mr. cobham,you could could argue norman conners,alphonse mouzon were the ones ,but Billy is the best. Spectrum is as the name implies, a full spectrum of a very ,very talentd musician. Check out; anxiety.le lis,snoopys search, and red baron. SPECTRUM is great!!! buy it"
1,Fusion becomes muzak.,"IF you're thinking of buying this because Cobham played with Mahavishnu, you're in for a big disappointment. This has NONE of the raw energy or lighting guitar work that characterized Mahanishnu. It's slow, repetitive, mellow (ie. boring). Buy this only if you liked Mahavishnu's most mellow stuff."
4,DON'T LIKE JAZZ? CHECK THIS OUT!,"I PUT OFF GETTING THIS CD FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS AFTER I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M NOT A BIG JAZZ FAN, BUT I RUN A CD STORE AND ONE DAY I DECIDED TO POP IT OPEN AND LET ONE OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES HEAR ONE OF THE CUTS FROM THE TOMMY BOLIN BOX SET (QUADRANT 4) THERE WERE ABOUT THREE CUSTOMERS IN THE STORE, AFTER THE THIRD CUT A GIRL IN HER 20'S CAME UP AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WE WERE PLAYING AND BOUGHT OUR ONLY COPY, THE ONE WE WERE PLAYING, BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR THE ENTIRE ALBUM. SO I HAD TO WAIT ABOUT A WEEK TO HEAR THE REST OF IT AND I PURCHASED IT SOON AFTER. GREAT DRUMS, KEYBOARD AND OF COURSE THE BEST GUITAR PLAYING FROM TOMMY BOLIN. HE SMOKES ON THE SOLOS AND TRADES OFF WITH COBHAM ON DRUMS TO PRODUCE A TRUE JAZZ/ROCK FUSION EFFECT. I'M STILL NOT MUCH OF A JAZZ FAN, BUT THIS IS ONE ALBUM THAT WILL NEVER LEAVE MY COLLECTION. NOW IF ONLY I COULD GET MY HANDS ON A COPY OF ""MIND TRANSPLANT"" AND ""MOXY"" MY TOMMY BOLIN COLLECTION WOULD BE COMPLETE. ENJOY!"
1,This book is 99% crap.,"I have 2 bookshelves of bargain .net books. This is by far the worst on the whole collection.I was expecting a book on component building. What I got was a walkthrough of building a clunky enterprise application. For component building, I reccommend the Apress! Class design Handbook as a starting point.Despite the inappropriate title, I read on and found poor practice after poor practice. If I were tasked with maintaining the resulting application, I would schedule a re-write from scratch.For a better insight about modern real world n-tier and component development, I recommend any of Rockford Lhotka's Business Objects books, especially the newer ones."
2,Not realistic,"I got this to play a prank on fellow adults. I found it was too symmetrical, and quite purple. I could only produce barf like this if I drank lots of grape pop and barfed very gently and carefully in a neat pattern."
1,ordered Barf but received Vomit,We ordered tan Braf but received purple Vomit. It's nowhere close to the picture and is totally unrealistic. Even my 10 year old claimed lame.....so I guess the joke was on us. No biggy for the price but my kid was truely disappointed.
5,Our grandson loves the fake barf!,"We ordered the fake barf for our grandson several weeks ago. It is very realistic, and he has enjoyed pranking everyone with it. Excellent product and good price."
3,Not realistic but good for kids,"This barf is really fake looking.. With that said, I'm sure my nephew will still love it. And the odds are he'll trick one or two of his dumber friends with it. The Price is right."
1,Fake Barf=CRAP!,This is the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. The picture in no way shows what the actual product looks like. The actual fake barf is a light yellowish green with neon pink and green chunks of plastic stuck to it. It's very cheesy and cheap looking. My son loves practical jokes so I thought he would love this. Even he (9 yr old) thought it was crappy. He didn't even realize it was supposed to be vomit until he read the paper it came with. I am extremely disappointed with this fake barf. I wish I could give this product no stars!!!!!!! If you are contemplating buying this DO NOT BUY!!!!!
5,awesome product,I used this fake barf and fooled my friends and family. Looks real and it is big. not sure what the other reviewers bought but this one looks gross and it works.
2,Ok but not too realistic,"I've owned good fake vomit, and this one is merely average. Looks a little too much like bits of foam dropped into a circle of rubber. Ok for very small kids."
1,it doesn't look anything like barf!!!! and nothing like the picture,do not buy... a huge disappointment. A white piece of plastic with a couple of orange squares!!! apparently the manufacturers have never seen throw up from any living thing!
4,Amazin Babes,"From start to finsih this movie is Babilicious. Especially the cutie in the beginning that gets the axe hanging upside down, and the hillbillies wife who does her own impression of the get wet scene from Flashdance."
4,Good too the last drop...,"...of dead bodies that is! From start to finish... was never bored. Heck, what am I saying... I was pretty much on the edge of my seat. Good entertainment, folks."
2,Silo Killer not much fun..........,This movie offers nothing new to the horror genre. From reading the other reviews it makes me wonder if we saw the same movie.It seemed to me somebody found a desolate stretch of land with a few empty buildings and silos around and decided to throw on a cruddy Halloween mask and make a bad slasher flick.I did give this movie 2 stars. One star for the soundtrack and decent acting. The other star is for the young lady with the massive breasts.Would I recommend this movie? No.Will I ever watch this movie again? No.Will I continue to waste money on bad horror movies waiting to find a diamond in the rough? Yes I will and that's why you don't have to. Don't waste your time with this one. Don't waste your money. Step away from the keyboard.Go outside and play catch with the neighborhood kids. Trust me.
4,English no good - Movie Grate,do not speek good english. Not from America. Watch movie and like. Only give four stars becouse did not understand dialog. Hope sub title version come out soon. Good to wotch movie anyway.
3,Decent Horror Movie,"I'm not a horror movie fan, so I don't really understand why the other people here are giving this movie 5 stars... But I'll have to admit, I did like the movie... And I never really like horror films so I guess that means it's pretty good. It was definetly worth the watch."
5,Even Better the Second Time!,"I'm not generally the type of person that gets involved in writing these reviews online, but I felt this movie deserved a plug. I've watched it the last two nights in a row and it just keeps getting better. OUTSTANDING MOVIE!"
3,NOT A BAD LITTLE INDY HORROR FLICK!,"""SILO KILLER"" is a fun low budget flick that is definetly worth checking out. there are some very creative things going on in this movie mixed with some decent acting & some bad acting & also a couple of good murder scene's & some very dull & dry murder scene's but all together its a pretty creative & fun little slasher flick with a neat twisty ending! enjoy fellow horror fans!"
3,SILO KILLER SIZZLES,"This movie has got two things going for it. Bands and Brandon Malone. What can I say, not only is this movie good, it's filled with great music, and that hottie Brandon Malone who plays Stu. Somebody tell me where this guy came from. What the movie lacks in technicalities, it makes up for in story, dialogue, music, and acting. Read it here first, this movie rocks, and there's something in it for everyone. Don't be surprised if these guys make it big (including the bands), and I'll be shocked if we don't see the steamy Brandon Malone in the near future. Or at least on a billboard somewhere. Run, don't walk to your nearest video store and pick this movie up. You won't be disappointed!"
3,A little better then your average B movie.,"Every Saturday I visit my little brother and watch some [bad] B-movie (he is a real B-movie fan) I saw this movie on amazon and it seemed to have a good review. It wasnt as good as evryone said. But is defiently a good enough to be number four of all the B-movies I have ever seen, oh yeah one more thing it has a good villian, oh yeah one more thing PUPPET MASTER RULES."
3,Motorola V171 phone (NET 10),"I've been a Net 10 customer for a year now. I have a few minor complaints....I cannot download ringtones in my area and I had to reactivate my voice mail as T-Mobile voice message system hijacked my phone and I was unable to retrieve my voice mail messages. Receivers of my phones calls say I cut in and out even though I hear them crystal clear. For the price, I shouldn't complain. I do not use it often so it is nice to carry over my unused minutes. If I had to do over, I would not purchase this flip phone. It feels like the phone is going to break in half everytime I open it, its not very stable. Customer service is OK but it needs to be 24/7. Overall, I am somewhat satisfied."
1,Net10 is horrible. STAY AWAY!!!,"I ported a phone number I've had for years from TracFone to Net10. After about 2 months, my phone (Motorola V171) stopped receiving calls. After dozens of calls to the untrained Net10 customer ""service"" number and five (5) replacement sim cards, they assigned me a new phone number against my express direction. Now all my years of business advertising is worthless and my customers cannot reach me. Would rate ZERO stars if possible. This company is the pits. STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Good service...Just don't let the phone get stolen!,"I used to have Net10 service. Until my phone was stolen. The phone had over 1000 minutes on it. I called Net10 with the police report and they told me that ""we are not responsible for lost or stolen equipment/minutes."" After talking to 4 supervisors, I gave up. I filed a complaint with the FCC. I FINALLY got somone that spoke English who called me regarding my FCC complaint. I got a full refund. All this took over 30 days. I now have Sprint Fair & Flexable and have had it for over 2 years, and just signed up for another 2! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,This phone is getting a bad rap-,"I have had net10 and this phone for around three or four years now. I usually don't bother writing reviews, but after reading all the (fake?)one star reviews I had to throw in my two cents. This phone is great for a low minute, non tech geek user. If your under seventeen, or need the latest gadget look elsewhere. My prior phone was also a Motorola and much more expensive but didnt have the range or battery life of this one. I admit my phone isn't a big deal to me, I just want one when I need to make a quick call, and this serves the purpose. As far as the customer service goes, I've had to call over three or four times and always had my problems resolved. Yes it sounds like its in India, but tell me which ones aren't these days. I have replaced this phone once, but c'mon, it's thirty bucks. The guy complaining about a warranty is a little over the top to me. Anyway, decent phone, decent service, great price."
1,Don't buy this phone.,"I have been sent two of these phones and none of them worked without some kind of defect. I am now in the process of purchasing another phone, but not this one!"
1,worst customer service ever,"I've had my 3 phones for a week.Since then I have been on hold for 2 and 1/2 hours.and now 2 out of 3 phones work, sort of.5 transfers to get text to work without triple charging.35 minutes on hold to get disconnected for no reason.Promotion minute bonuses not honored. (20 minute hold)and on and on and on.Unless your super poor or need a not so reliable cell phone for emergency's.....do not buy."
4,good little phone,"I like this little flip phone. The service has been good and the features are easy to use. The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last. The flip part is a little weak, but we will have to see. It was really easy to add minutes, and you can do it right from your Net10 phone."
1,Worst Customer Service,"They may have the cheapest rate, but you'll pay for it with the worst customer service on the planet. Just try and get the correct address to return your phone....good luck. Phone tree hell is more like it. Once you get there, the outsourcing to overseas operators who haven't a clue should just about kill anybody's patience.In case you need to return your phone, here is the correct address: Tracfone Return Center, Bright Point Reverse Logistics, 1251 Perry Rd, Plainfield, IN 46168.I'm sending my phone back today....I'll let you know if I ever receive my refund. Yikes, what a terrible company to deal with.....you are warned!!!update: Sorry, I forgot to post this long ago. I did receive my refund. I'm re-living the nightmare as I write this...I may not sleep tonight."
2,net10 customer service,"having dealt with net10 csr's , i can honestly say they suck big time, i don't care if they are paying you to use it, stay away ! every time u have to call, and you will, count on waiting at least a half hour before getting connected, then , they will not understand English , they are unable to grasp what is going on , and, they will not fix your complaint , this is one company that should fold, or open up a call center in the USA, because the ones they use now are totally incompetent"
3,"""This looks familar...""","In 1985 the Doctor & Peri land on Earth to investigate a spacial distress signal, only to discover that some old enemies are waiting for them in the dark. ""Attack of the Cybermen"" both succeeds and fails at the same time. On one hand it is a fast paced action yarn with lots of explosions, gun play and violence. On the other, the casual viewer will be totally lost, as this serial is a sequel and/or a follow up to several Who serials. Let's just say that Who continuity and mythology are jackhammered into the plot, that nothing more original can be added in. Well, the Cryons are new, the inhabitants of Telos, the Cybermen's adopted homeworld, and it's nice to see Terry Molloy sans Davros mask, and the Cyber conversion is shown for the first time. A vastly improved story compared to the 21st Season's close, but also a sign of bad and good things to come..."
2,Does not fit,"I had the same experience as G. Mealhouse. It is too wide for the slot on my Milwaukee circular saw. The problem seems to be that the metal-stamping process left several little 'nubs' of metal along the edge. I will have to file them off.Until I can do that, though, I forced the thing into the slot (skinning a knuckle in the process) and used it, and it does the job nicely so long as you don't want to rip anything wider than six inches. The measurements on the scale are accurate. I'm sure I'll be happy with it once I can modify it to fit properly.Update Dec. 2009: I finally got around to filing off those 'nubs' and now it does a good job. Still a little too snug in the slot but usable and very useful."
3,Don't Fence me in...,The Milwaukee Rip Fence is well crafted of stamped steel. About the same as any other rip fence.It comes with several thumb screws and fits several Milwaukee models.I have found the ruler markings to be accurate and the fit and finish to the saw acceptable.
3,Country Bard,"When most people think ""Country Music"" they envision the Rhinestone ""New"" Country that dominates the airwaves. Steve Earle is a different sort of Country. One that goes back to Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and all the other Country musicains that merged Country and Rock and never fit in with the Nashville set but had too much twang to be Rock. As seen in this compilation of his song lyrics he doesn't write typical songs about crying in his beer or technicolor Roy Rogers landscapes. His lyrics have a poetic quality and touch on themes as far ranging as the Civil War to getting high in New York City. Although I prefer to hear Steve Earle sing his lyrics this book is enjoyable on its own."
3,"flawed with British arrogance, but readable and interesting","This book drips with old-fashioned racism and outrage that anyone would ever want to rebel against the british empire. It could have been written a hundred years ago. Balancing that, it's readable and concise, but could use more maps to illustrate the action for people not familiar with India."
4,if you have a hair dye allergy,"I'm a redhead whose hair is not as red as it used to be. After finding out that I cannot use regular hair dye (horribly allergic), I resorted to powdered henna. Though the color is not exactly like my natural red hair and it can get a little brassy with time, it was the next best thing.Thankfully, a friend told me about Surya henna. It's liquid, easy and the color is nicer, not ot mention it seems to be less brassy over time. If you don't want to or can't use traditional dye, I recommend this over powdered henna!"
4,"Fades fast, but good for a touch up","I usually use powder henna because it lasts a lot longer, but this is good for a touch up if I don't have much time. It lasts about 3 weeks, so it would be good for someone who wants to try henna before committing to the powder stuff which is more permanent. This stuff smells pretty good, is easy to apply, and makes hair very soft. I just wish the results lasted longer!"
3,words,"Ah, yes, words. the right brains answer to the analytical subconsious forming the 4th quandrant connection in the Jungian alchemey. But the real question is does Neurontin form a limit cycle by shunting inhibition, (by blocking GABA) or neuronal burst oscillation with L-type calcium channel gates. For word people, does Alien abduction have anything to do with the boogey man will get you? Or is it related to Nocturanal Assault Syndrome."
4,The standard that all others are compared to,"This saw works for me. Twelve years, so far, in the electrical contracting business. It did need some bearing work after 11 years. Its not the most powerful or the one with the longest stroke. Its not the beast that the Tiger Saw is but for the price, you can not beat it."
4,Breakfast Set,"I bought this for my son, I wanted to get him a playset that will encourage pretending. I found this one at a discount store - must say I spent much less than it is priced here. But, I would spend the extra money to buy it full priced from Amazon because he loves it so much. The biggest initial seller on this toy was the fact that it wasnt a tea set! Its a coffee set and not too gender specific. The toaster is still too hard for him to work (he is only 15 months old), he can push down the toast but cant turn the timer. But, he loves the coffee pot sounds and ""drinking"" from the cups. This is a great, durable toy!"
4,A Good Buy,"Very easy to use. Just plug and play. Decent quality for mid, low pitch, but not so good for high pitch. The software to adjust the mic can be downloaded in the company's website. However, it's not compatible with my MediaCenter version of XP. Overall, a pretty good mic for the money."
1,Samson mic a disappointment,"This samson mic is not good enough if the intent is for audiobook or any other type work that others will listen to. But it is more than adequate for personal use. The gain is super low, so amplification is needed which then increases the hissing background noise. when the noise is removed with noise remover, the voice gets distorted. It was a huge disappointment to me because I wanted to use it for audiobook that others will listen to."
3,Samson mic,"Nice, works, put the company doesn't have the levels software for it. The Web site says it's coming."
4,Great intro. into Texas Garage.,I have been collecting Garage Songs for 30 years and found some old favorites and a couple of new ones on this compilation and Texas Garage is the best IMHO.
4,3 in 1 car kit for IPOD,I use this with my video IPOD in my car and it seems to work very well. Shipping was on time - no complaints.I would purchase this item again.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"I bought this product to use in my car for my Zune media player. Since the first day I used it in my car.....all it produced was static and noise! There are only 4 channel presets....and if those 4 channels are not clear...then you will get lots of audio disruption. Maybe if Satechi extends the channel presets from 87.1 to 107.9 (like most fm transmitters do), then maybe there won't be a problem. But I gave one star only for the car charger feature. I don't live in a city...I live in a suburb...so traffic isn't a problem. Other than than...don't buy this! I am awaiting for the company to call me back to give me a refund hopefully! If you have an auxillary jack in your car....you are better off getting an auxillary cable. You'll get clear sound that way!"
1,Car kit far from adequate,"I got this kit for 27.99. The FM transmitter does not work at all. There are 4 channels for broadcasting of which none work. This just produces FM noise in my radio. The only plus that I can see having this is the charger that holds the player. The holder is also quite flimsy and feels like molded plastic. It is held but quite wobbly when in the cigarette lighter. I give this a one star, only for the charging capabilities. This item should be called ""Car Charger / Holder""."
1,Short term was not good,the product did not work well and did not even last enough to get my money's worth!!!!!! I am so disappointed I dont know if I want to return the broken transmitter or even bother with it...Depressed!!! Lost my money!Dont get this one!
2,Don't buy this product,"I had it for about four months then it stopped holding the Zune, then the charger broke and I just threw it out the window... piece of junk...and the FM thing was crap"
1,"Great as a holder, doesn't work as a transmitter","If you want a transmitter for your Zune, look elsewhere. This transmitter has four presets, all in the 88 fm range, none of which worked for me. However, it is an EXCELLENT holder for your Zune. It holds it securely and powers the Zune as well. I gave this a one star review because the product advertises as a Car Charger / Fm Transmitter / Holder. If it were just a Holder/Charger, I would give a 4 star review."
4,Review,"This is one of the best FM transmitters i have seen, and it works perfectly with the zune. However, i still do not use it that often because the sound quality is far from perfect. Static comes and goes- at some times the static is so prominent that the music can hardly be heard, and at others the static is hardly noticeable."
5,Get Fitter After 50,"Fitter After 50 profiles dozens of individuals, ages 50 to 100, who are in better shape than most 40, 30, or even 20-year-olds. One such individual is Helen Klein. Helen started running when she was 55 and now at 79 she has run 28 races of 100 miles or more. These stories will inspire you to get off your duff and get back in shape as nothing else will. Not your usual boring exercise book -- these pages sizzle with the human-growth-hormone-increasing secrets of these Masters of Fitness. I loved it!!"
3,encouraging you to be fitter after 50,"This is not a how to book.There are no menus, no exercise regimens no health tips.It is encouraging stories of people over 50 years old, who changed their lives for the better and got fitter & healthier after 50if you want menus, exercise regimens & health tips go elsewhere"
5,How can you get your parents to treat you like an adult?,"Well it's all here! For once a book to help figure it out! Every time I would visit my parents, they would treat me like a child. Reading this book helped me figure out why. It shows how your adult relationship with your parents is shaped by the ingrained patterns in your family history. It helped me understand why my parents treat me the way they do even though I'm an adult. It taught me how to respond to them positively as an adult - no matter how they continue to act! With changing my actions and behaviors toward my parents, they began to change also! This book discusses different roles played by parents such as: Mother Maryter and Dad Dictator. It is beautifully written and talks about the ""script"" each of us play in each others lives!"
3,Pots to Hot,"Although I LOVE the design and shape of the fish oven mitt, I was disappointed that the mitt did not have enough insulation to really use in the kitchen. Perhaps if you were just moving a pot from the stove the mitt would work. However, I would not pick up a pan out of the oven with it."
3,Cute for bachelor/fisherman,"I bought this for my boyfriend who had no oven mitts, it isn't of the greatest quality, but it was more for a joke than anything. He has used it to pull pans out of the oven, no complaints."
5,Unforgettable!,"I first saw this movie during its initial release in 1971, and it has stayed with me ever since. It is a poignant film, wonderfully written, acted, directed, and photographed. The interplay among the Terrible Trio (Hermie, Oscy, Benjie) is quite funny indeed, and most men will relate to the boys' curiosity about sex. But the scenes between Hermie and Dorothy raise this film into an exalted realm of the cinema, capturing the human spirit with rare insight. The sequence after the War Department telegram arrives is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful, sweet, sensitive scenes ever to be filmed. It is handled by director Robert Mulligan with great taste and sensitivity. Among bittersweet, nostalgic, coming-of-age movies, only this one and the equally brilliant (but sadly neglected) ""A Summer Story"" and ""1918"" strike me as achieving such a remarkable level of honesty. Please make it a point to see ""Summer of '42."" You will never forget it."
4,A poignant love story in the middle of the WW2!,"Two lonely people: one of them, the young wife of an Officer who has been sent to the War Front and a free teenager, bewitched by her and just in the sexual awakenings, will live a curious and brief romance.Arresting images and Michelle Legrand' s captivating musical score make of this film an unforgettable picture.The impressive beauty of Jennifer O ` Neil hooked a great portion of the audience."
5,"A classic ""guys"" coming of age film","A great, under-appreciated film. I put this dvd in and my wife, who'd never even heard of the film, loved it. They truly do not make films like this anymore."
5,Still good,"I was worried that this movie would be dated and not as good as I remembered from when I saw it long ago, but it wasn't. Still touching, and Jennifer O'Neill is still as beautiful as I remembered."
1,Double Standard,"Why is it that sex between an adult man and an underage girl is considered abuse, but sex between an adult woman and an underage boy is considered a touching rite of passage?"
5,An Instant Holiday Classic!,"In the tradition of ""Peanuts"", ""Home Alone"", ""The Grinch"" ""Rudolph"", ""Frosty"". and ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and Long before Wilhelmina Slater from ""Ugly Betty"", Ebony Scrooge happens to be a Pop Superstar who does'nt have the heart for Christmas. And if you love ""Ugly Betty"" like I did, and ""Desperate Housewives"" every Sunday. There's a little Wilhelmina inside of Ebony Scrooge. Vanessa does know how to play bad girls very well, and to the contrair; If Mark St. James is to Wilhelmina, as Bob Cratchett is to Ebony Scrooge. It's the one movie YOU gotta have!"
4,Love This Movie!,"I orignally saw this movie a few years ago on VH1 cable channel. I enjoyed it so much and I was delighted to finally find it on DVD and bought it right away. Vanessa Williams stars as singer Ebony Scrooge and she plays her diva qualities to the fullest. The storyline is similar with the whole Scrooge theme just in a modern twist with Vanessa being confronted by the 3 ghosts of christmas in a New York hotel suite. I watched it the same day I got it, back in May with the kids and I enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw it.Be warned though, the ""B----"" word is spoken more than 3 times in the movie( it was taken out when it was shown on VH1 )so that would be my only complaint about this movie so I couldn't give it 5 stars. The word wasn't needed to describe her diva behavior and it shouldn't be in a holiday film. All in all it was still enjoyable and funny and I have added this movie to my Christmas collection of dvd's and will be watching it again at Christmas."
1,Not representative of Dara!,"Dara has put out some of my favorite D'n'B - but this ... this is terrible. The beats are too shallow, the mixes are too simple. But rest assured ... this is the only work of this caliber released by Dara."
4,This is not a DnB Mix Cd!,"I read all these scathing reviews on here saying ""This sounds nothing like Dara's new stuff"" ect.. What many people fail to realize is that after this album Dara did DnB mixes. A DnB mix is the Dj taking other artists tracks and blending them seamlessy to make the whole album feel like one long track hence the word ""Mix"". This album is original Dara music that HE created. Look at the song titles on his stuff after this album it has the song name-artist. We are comparing apples and oranges when you say this doesnt sound like his new stuff. Hope that clears things up. This is a good chill album and Dara did a good job with this one."
1,Someone Involved With the Movie,"Some people have far too much time on their hands. Lots of bitterness here. We made this movie in 3 days for $900. It was a fun experiemnt for a bunch of friends to get together and have a good time. Someone at Dead Alive Productions saw it and made an offer. Would you turn down money? No, that would be stupid. Too bad these reviewers got NONE of the jokes. Zilcho. If you wanted to watch something good, you should have watched something else. Oh, thanks for the sale... I love royalty payments.For the forty year old virgin living in his mother's basement (see review below) that wants to smack me in the face: I relish the thought of you taking a day off of work from your 7-11 Assistant Manager job and doing the deed."
1,"Want My $ ""Back""!","I'm not ashamed to be an aficianado of low-budget, no-budget and generally low-brow video. To me it is true talent to create anything gripping and entertaining from nothing. ""Backwoods"" instead creates NOTHING from nothing.Watching this ""video"" is akin watching the biggest fools you could hope to never meet traipse through the wilderness in a possible state of intoxication screaming at one and another for an hour plus.The losers who put this together probably worked one another into a destructive and delusional groupthink that the video they were making will be ""so BAD it will be GOOD!"". No, this is so bad it is bad. The video should be burned, the writer/director/producer/actors BANISHED from the industry."
1,Back Woods,"The plot description gives you what this movie is about. The only thing that I can say that is positive about this movie is the cover to the dvd...otherwise save your time and money. Low budget, extremely boring, special effects for the gore left me laughing. I thought this movie was put together by a group of kids who had nothing better to do in an afternoon, then try to attempt to make a horror flick. If you think that this movie is up your alley find someone who owns it and like I said save your money. If you want to laugh at a very poor attempt of a movie that I would rate lower than a ""B-movie"" this one fits the bill."
1,HORRIBLE,"People, I beg of you. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. Please don't! It's so DUMB!!!!! It is shot with A HOME VIDEO CAMERA....you heard me. The acting is so incomprehendedly vile, I just can't describe it. Even if you're curious, don't buy it. I was curious, and I paid severely. I cried that day, because I couldn't believe I actually bought this ""movie"". To this day I lie awake in bed, wondering if anyone, besides the actors, enjoy it. None of the deaths are good. The whole thing looks so shaky that you cannot tell what's going on. The sound is horrible. The music is horrible. Why, it's so shockingly bad, that there should be an 11th Commandment against it. ""Thou shalt not watch Back Woods"". I am now convinced that David Hayes is the Anti-Christ. Actually, everyone who is involved with this movie are Anti-Christs. In short, I hate this movie. Peace out."
3,A first film,"This is the first film of the Mischief series, and it shows. They're starting to decide what the ""Mischief thing"" is, and it's just too unfocused. I appreciate the enthusiasm of showing tons of different action clips, but there are so many, that it becomes a mash up. Here's what's in it: Random street racing clips, donuts in the snow, jumping a rental car (pretty funny, fyi), detroit auto show, offroading a rental (hopefully) car, skateboarding, motorcycle stunting, drag racing, dirt biking, drag racing crashes. There's also a classic clip that you may have seen on youtube: there's a massive street race that get's shut down by the police where they trap everyone in and start towing and ticketing. Some guys in an MR2 form a plan with a couple other drivers to escape and avoid being ticketed. I was happy to see that again."
2,Moderately OK,"This movie is filled with short drag races. Quater mile, Eighth, muscle cars, rice burners, even suvs. They also have s part refered to as ""auto abuse"". I acctually found this segment dissappointing but on the other hand i'm a bit more wild. Not something that can be watched more than 2 or 3 times"
3,some good versions,"""Before"" is a great song for getting over being dumped, especially for gay men. I liked this as a first album single even though I hated the disc ""Bilingual"" with a passion, worst PSB disc ever. On this CD single, mixes 3 through 5 were good. However, the disc falls apart and gets really dull by the end. This is when Danny Tenaglia was starting to be known nationwide, yet his remix is not good at all. This is a disc for listening until half-way through."
3,It could of been more...,"Living in Houston and driving to parties in NO almost every weekend I expected a lot more from this DVD. I know its hard to capture everyones experience or view but overall too many blurry shots, not enough clear, focus shots, and the editing didn't help either. The bonus scenes of the 'Rave Act' made the DVD for me. I would probably agree with the other reviewer when he says you might find it boring if you weren't there or know anyone in it; i can see that point. But it is a keeper for me because it did bring back some great memories of Zoolu, 50ft Raver Zombies, Yars Revenge, Summer Fever....and many, many more. I recommend this DVD to the people who had the privilege to experience the parties during that time."
2,It's o.k.,"Not the best documentary that I've seen, but it has it's parts. The most interesting part, in my opinion, of this film is that it's the beginning of the Rave Act."
1,Mislead.,"This could have been made a whole lot better. I'm certain it wasn't fair for all those talented DJ's and musicians to be a part of this movie, because it wasn't put together the way you'd think. It's not a documentary on how Disco Donnie was put on trial or anything, it's more like ""Here's 3 Easy Steps On Becoming A Raver: Nevermind those Freaks"" The soundtrack is pretty good, with Q-Bert and Crystal Method, but the whole package really isn't up to par with Groove, Human Traffic, etc."
3,new orleans rave scene,Its OK if you went to State Palace in N.O. back in the late 90's when the rave scene was huge. But as a casual viewer you would probably find it ignorant.
5,An amazing book.,"Even just reading this book is enough to make you want to live your life in a more positive way for it's own sake. I'm only 16 years of age, but the sense of benevolence I am already wanting to develop is very encouraging. This book is 1337"
2,Message is lost in words,"More than half of the book consists of quoting what other people have said. In remaining few pages the author goes on repeating the same things again and again in different words and ways. In the end the reader is left with little to hold on to besides words. It si better to use this time to meditate instead. If you must read, you may want to try ""You have to say something"" book:You Have to Say Something."
2,Too Complicated,"The books kind of complicated and requires a lot of reading. Instead people should try something like, ""Discover happiness"" by Shengren. Much better and fun to read as well."
1,not as expected,"wanted a book on beginner meditation but got 2CD's of talking instead . Thats not my cup of tea, Ineed books and pics."
1,A Last Minute Term Paper,"This book reads like a undergrad student's last minute term paper. It is sophomoric, bland and lacks critical analysis. It does not so much talk about the practical applications of 'happiness' as to discuss the dictionary meanings of it in every language and culture. Boring and useless!"
1,This book is a fraud,"This book calls itself a guide to happiness in its title. That is a lie. The entire book is more like philosophy than how to be happy. The whole time he rambles about his philosophy. The people buying this book want to learn how to be happy. He only tells you one method the whole book! Meditation, and he barely tells you how. One method, 270 pages. Barely discusses that method. This book is a waste of time and money. Barf."
4,Very impressive,"Most points have been made by the other reviews, I don't disagree with them. This book offers insight with the feel-good factor, all explained both thoroughly and clearly. It avoids chocolatey platitudes and the psychological cushions of the self-help industry - although the language is occasionally a little soapy (hence four stars rather than five). Overall, an excellent book, and one I recommend highly for anyone in need of a meaningful lift."
4,A lot like a British digestive..,"These crackers are quite good, as other have noted they are thicker and have a more crumbly texture than the traditional Carr's crackers. If you have ever had a British digestive cracker, these are quite similar. Both slightly sweet, thick, whole grains, crumbly.When I bought these I was expecting the traditional thing flaky Carr's cracker. If you plan to serve these at a party, make sure to consider what you are serving them with. You may have to adjust the cheese/spreads/etc that you plan to accompany the cracker given its different taste, texture and structure."
5,One of my favorite new finds,"I tried this with a cream-cheese appetizer I made recently and was really pleased. They are a little bit thicker than most snack crackers but the taste is not heavy at all. They remained firm even though the dish had a sauce and the crackers were partially in the sauce.Very nice taste, heaty but not heavy, without getting in the way of what was on it. And whole wheat as well. Recommended."
3,3 Grams of Sugar in 2 crackers?,"I received my package in the mail opened up the box and started eating the crackers. I said to myself ""wow these crackers taste pretty good"" then I looked at the box. 3 Grams of Sugar in just 2 crackers?Why bother with a whole grain cracker if it's got that much sugar in it?I know most people don't care (so I won't bad mouth them too much) but I've got to keep my sugar intake down. That's the only reason why I gave them a 3 instead of a 5."
2,disappointed,disappointed - did not realize that I needed to plug it into the electrical socket 5 feet away. Plan on returning it
4,Simple to install if you have a millivolt igniter system.,"Pros: This unit works great and was simple to install. The remote transmitter utilizes a Radio Frequency signal, instead of Infra Red, so the receiving unit can be hidden behind the lower grill on the gas fireplace. It came with a battery for the remote transmitter.Cons: The remote transmitter uses an oddball and probably expensive-to-replace battery."
1,What you see is not what you get,"I purchased the ""so called"" battery operated fireplace remote expecting to get just that. Unfortunately, when the package arrived, the battery remote looked nothing like the picture in the description and required being plugged in to a 120 volt outlet to work. Needless to say, I immediately arranged to return the item to Smart Home.On the positive side, the purchase, shipping speed, and return process were all handled expeditiously."
4,My case,I like my case but I don't think it does my phone justice. Whatever it does what it's suppose to and that's all I need for now.
5,Absolutely great!,"Velvet Angel is unique, fantastic and excellent! It is unforgettable! Read this and you'll never regret it."
4,"A Good Finish to the ""Velvet"" Series","This is the final and most endearing of the story of the four Montgomery brothers. I had been looking forward to reading about Miles, he is supposed to be the strong silent type of all the brothers. I fell in love with the romance bewteen the passionate Miles and the stubborn Elizabeth. A very enjoyable read and a good finish to the series."
1,Just horrible,"I read The Summerhouse by Jude Deveraux before and really enjoyed it so I thought I would give the Velvet series a shot and I wish I hadn't.In all of the books the stories drag, there is always countless misunderstandings between the Montgomery men and their wives that make no sense but someone end up being resolved by the women with their husbands finally showing how much they love their wives. I wish that Jude Deveraux had written her characters with more depth. So many of the stories started off strong and somehow at the end its like she got bored and slapped on a happy ending.Also at the end of the book Jude Deverax does a short epilogue to tell you what happened to everyone and I just couldn't believe how pat she made everything at the end."
3,Miles,It's hard to believe that Jude Deveraux could create such a pointless tale. Miles had 3 illegitimate children from 3 different women! Almost legendary for his ablility to seduce women. He loves all of womankind. What makes Elizabeth believe at first that she would be more than his little casual romp in the bed?
2,Disappointing,"I have read a few JD books since the beginning of the year and I have really loved some of the others such as the Heiress and the Raider but I found Velvet Angel rather disappointing. I didn't like Elizabeth and I thought that Miles must have been a real ""goer"" to have had already 3 children at the tender age of 20! I suppose they didn't have contraception in those days. Still it's not very romantic to read that the hero has so many children running around already even before he has met the heroine! I didn't think much of the plot either."
2,Really bad story,"When I read this book, I felt like the author was under a deadline to get it into the publisher. There is little character development, and the plot is ridiculous, even for a romance. And then there are the multiple endings. I count four endings. And I didn't really like the main characters and the endings became cartoonish. There was sex, but no real heat."
5,4th and last book in the VELVET SERIES !!!,"Last book in the Velvet Series, Velvet Angel , the story is about the youngest one,Miles Montgomery and Elizabeth Chatsworth,sister of the man who caused the death of his beloved sister. Miles very angry due to his sister's death,Elizabeth was delivered to him by one of his enemies...he wanted revenge,but once he saw her,everything changed...and of course all the Montgomery brothers are in this book with their beloved wives,alot of love in the story,i loved it, an end to the Velvet Series, highly recommended..."
2,Not as good as the first two!,"After reading ""Velvet Promise"" and ""Highland Velvet"", I must say that I was disappointed by this book. Miles was a great hero, but Elizabeth was just so annoying."
4,Terrific story. I want to read the rest of the series.,"Many reviews have been written detailing this story, so I will make my review short.I've read Jude Deveraux before, and really enjoy her writing. That prompted me to buy ""Velvet Angel."" I didn't realize at the time, that it was the finale to a series. The characters were humorous and the story fast- paced from the very first page.I gave the book 4 stars, instead of five, because a few things annoyed me:The hero is quick to judge the heroine falsely over something that obviously was not her fault. For that, he banishes her from his life for a while. Luckily, it doesn't take too much of the story to reunite them.Second, the characters were very typical. He's a powerful warrior who has had hordes of women. She is a sharp- tongued virgin. I still enjoyed reading about them, because they both were quite funny at times.I will be reading the rest of the series. This one was definitely worth- while."
4,The Album Title Says It All!,Big band doo-wop? That pretty well describes the Duprees. This 2-CD set covers their entire career including more recent efforts. Every hit is included which makes it a worthwhile purchase.
5,A MUST-HAVE Book if you believe beauty starts from within,"Zia offers lots of wisdom in taking care of your mind, body and face as you move into your mid-years and beyond. While Zia products are some of the best I've ever used, she offers suggestions on other products. An excellent resource!"
5,Eagle Cries,"If I haven't already given this CD for my family's and friend's birthdays, it will be under their Christmas trees! This is the richest of Joanne's albums. I listen again and again, gleaning new meanings,hearing soulful refrains,and find myself leaning into the melodies, writing down the words, savoring each line. Eagle Cries is thought provoking, touching, healing, inspiring. Truly lovely!"
5,Crossover hit?,"Joanne Shenandoah may be the most talented singer/songwriter working today. Her voice has the power to transport and calm. In Eagle Cries, she adds a new intensity and energy to her music, one that should appeal to a broad audience. This is a wonderfully uplifting and timely album that almost seems to have anticipated and responded in advance to the horrors of 9-11. Buy it!"
3,Not bad but lots of updates,"With the price of this software you can't go wrong if you have a Razr phone. Just be ready to spend some time getting updates. I lost count after 7-8 version updates, it took about an hour to run all the updates since, unfortunately, some of them required a computer reboot. If you have a locked phone (such as those from Verizon or Alltel) you probably won't be able to upload any ringtones you create to your phone, but I am able to upload address books and calendar info from Outlook, sound files and pictures, as well as backup your phone files. Again, worth the price, but you might not be able to use all of the software's capability."
1,Don't Buy,"This product won't recognize my phone, even though it says SLVR L7 (my phone) in the title. The USB cable won't fit into the USB port on my computer because there is part of the plastic molding sticking out into the socket, so I could only connect my phone using an extension USB cable from my printer. Once I figured that out my computer recognizes that my phone is plugged in, but the Motorola Phone Tools program still won't recognize it."
2,Handy but Slow,"This Motorola Phones Tools is easy to use, however on my new computer it is very very slow to process any request. For instance, if you are creating a new ring tone it can take one hour, because every time you click a button it takes 30-60 to process. The software features are great, however, so if you have endless patience give it a try."
2,ugggh,"well i had a hard time figuring out how to work it. but finally i got it. DO NOT PLUG IT IN. just put the cd in and let it run. and then plug the phone in when it says...the other problem is that i got MPT up and it connected. so i click the ringtones and made my own. when i clicked transfer to phone it says that it wasnt connected..so i have no idea. what the hell is wrong.if ne1 could help me plz do. lol i have tried the other usb ports. but nothing:\oh n i was wondering if transfering the songs n stuff cost?oh btw i have sprint, MOTORAZR V3m"
4,Good,"Did the job, and customer service was very helpful (a few back and forth emails) when I had issues getting it installed on my Vista computer. I think I was using it with my old Motorola V300."
2,Product software was defective,"This product did not live up to it's promise. The software was defective and Motorola refused to replace the defective PC connectivity CD. The software did not fully install not allowing my laptop to recognize the Motorola RAZR phone I was trying to connect. Attempts to correct the problem were made via email with Motorola but the issue was never resolved to my satisfaction. Neither seller or Motorola refused to refund my money for this defective software. Don't buy it. If you do buy, do it in store and test the CD to make sure it works. Better yet, stay away from Motorola phones."
1,Dont buy from this seller!!!!!!!!!,The disk was an illegal copy!!! Label was created by a label maker!!! Not a real version!!! Disk was also cracked on delivery!!! Could not use!!!
2,Doesn't work...yet,The instructions included with the CD are overly simple and somewhat incomplete. I have not been successful in getting the software to recognise my phone yet. There is an 800 help number to call but I haven't tried that approach yet ... you know how helpful customer service can be. As soon as I am in a calm and unhurried mood I will try that option and update this review.
2,No full features for V3C,"If you have Verizon wireless, don't even bother buying this. The only feature you'd be able use is the address book function. All everything else is turned off for Verizon's phone."
2,Love it,"5 out of 5 stars *Used to have a V188 and had major problems trying to get the phone to sync with the PC. Works flawlessly with my Pebl using bluetooth after updating to the newest version of the software. Good price compared to getting it straight from Motorola. I love the ability to transfer photos and ringtones between PC and phone. Definate must-have accessory for (compatible) Moto phones* Ignore the 2/5 star rating. I originally reviewed this before I bought my Pebl. Amazon doesn't appear to let you edit the rating when you edit your review...seems like that would have been one of the reasons for the whole 'edit' feature in the first place, right?"
5,Works great and easy to use.,"When my husband's RAZR phone broke we thought we had lost all the pictures on it. Even at our cell phone company's store it sounded like getting pictures off of a phone with a broken screen would be very difficult. I finally called Motorola and they recommended this product (although they would've had me buy it new and pay a lot more). I bought it here instead and was able to very easily get all the pictures, videos, and contacts off of a broken phone. This is a wonderful product. It's great for anyone who has a Motorola phone. You can also transfer pictures and songs onto your phone using it although I didn't try that out since the phone was broken. This product allowed me to save 30 to 40 pictures of my kids and my littlest one was a newborn in many of them. I would recommend it to anyone. It saved me."
4,sheesh,"Well, it can be a real pain to get the software to recognize the phone. I'm pretty computer-savvy, and it took a while (and some googling) to figure out that I had to cancel the setup wizard before it actually tried to detect my phone and run the Live Update... then connect my phone (a v188). I then found, on the ""bonus cd,"" some sort of software installer specifically for the v188 that probably would have solved everything in the first place. Typical.Once it's running, life couldn't be easier. The interface is extremely simple and intuitive, and the bonus cd I got with it is PACKED with ring tones, games, thousands (literally) of wallpapers, etc. I'm impressed.So I docked it one star for motorola not having a seamless install by v3.x and really, really wanted to subtract another for the insult of the cable and software not coming with the phone in the first place. Should you need me, I'll be playing with my phone for the next week or two..."
5,Phone tools for cheap,"i needed to get some of my info off my phone, but didn't want to pay 50-60 bucks for two cords (one which i would never use) and the program. This is the full version that is just alittle outdated and you just download the update and your are up to date. Works great."
1,doesn't work on V325,Wasted my money on this product. I wanted this product to connect to V325 phone so I could download pics to my PC. It appears this product is used only to use phone as a modem since it only installs itself with modem drivers. It does not assist me in installing phone\camera as a USB drive.Live and learn.
5,the best poete maudit!,"Reading a poem by Baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in Paris. Formidable! I always return to this book, and I buy as many translations of it as I can. This one I think is the best. As a poet, Baudelaire was the master of describing the ""dark regions"" of the human soul. He was the Edgar Allan Poe of poetry."
3,"Poems are okay, but the formatting sucks","While I was not exactly thrilled with the poetry in this book, what bothers me most are the many formatting mistakes. Two spaces when there should be one; new lines when there shouldn't be; one word, like ""The,"" causing one line to be on two; and other seemingly minute errors that bothered me through the entire book. I am not a literature or a poetry buff, nor do I claim to know French; but I do have some writing and editing experience, and I can read. The publisher of this book insults me with these errors and I feel like I was used by paying for shotty formatting. As for the poems themselves, I guess they're okay. They weren't really my cup of tea, but they weren't horrible. I had no prior knowledge of Baudelaire before buying this book, and don't plan on buying another one of his books."
5,Absolutely essential reading,"We adore Baudelaire, and this edition is superb. It's essential reading for lovers of France, of the 19th century, of decadence, and of evocative poetry. Fabulous!"
2,for the love of depravity,"This book is a leftover from a long ago break-up with a French Athiest boyfriend many, many years ago... he was obsessed with Baudelaire and I wasn't. A bit raw for the sake of depravity, if you ask me. The ""all women are vile"" got a bit too repetitive for my taste. Even his moments of tenderness come across as cold and empty remorse, much like a child who gets scolded for being bad and then only apologizes because he was sorry he was caught. The one saving grace is that this Oxford version offers facing French text to compare language ""differentials"" ."
1,Kindle Version Awful,"This is a review for the Kindle Version. It is translated by Cyril Scott and has a mere 51 poems, as opposed to what it is advertised as having; the entire collection. It is translated in old English, but also a bad translation in general. It does not include The Voyage, which is ridiculous, and even titles Invitation to the Voyage with Journey instead. I love Baudelaire and study him intently. There are so many great translations and this is the one Kindle has? A bit embarrasing. While Baudelaire's words are undoubtedly here, they are poor in comparison to any number of translations. Kindle store, please invest in a better translation. This is a sleight to the master."
1,An unreadable mess,This review is for the kindle version of the Oxford World's Classics edition. It's an unreadable mess. The French and English versions are all jumbled together. Do not buy.
1,A bad joke from Las Vegas,"Don't buy this one if you want to read Baudelaire. There are many other editions out there. Personally, I would recommend an edition that has both the French original and English translation side by side. Even if you don't speak French, the rhythm becomes apparent."
1,The French edition with the Kindle is NOT Baudelaire!,"Do not get the French edition, it contains instead a story written by Edith Wharten, ""The Bunner Sisters."" You might remember her from the House of Mirth, and I'm not saying she's a bad authoress but I don't want to read the Bunner Sisters. I can't comment on the English version with Kindle but would suggest a bilingual edition."
1,Check the pages,"When buying this book, make sure you are buying the correct copy. I needed this for a college course and was sent a link to the long version but when i clicked paperback, it gave me a short book. I assumed the covers were different as they sometimes are, but check. I had to go into my course with the wrong book and had to fix it at the last minute. the short copy is only 70 pages long and the longer one is almost 500. Check which one you are buying.The Flowers of Evil (Oxford World's Classics) (English and French Edition)"
3,I suggest another translation,"Rather than this edition, I suggest Crosby's translation (Boa Publication). In it he has captured not only the meaning of B's poems, but maintained the music (rhythm and rhyme) of the poetry as well"
3,Not Long enough,"i was surprised, once this arrived, to see that it is not long enough to reach the floor without some body bending involved. The item itself is pretty good quality, but if you're using it because of physical (e.g. back) problems and you may not be able to bend at all, then the lack of adequate length is a real drawback. For that reason alone, I wish I had purchased something else (I had a different grabber for the last 8 years that was great, but it wore out)."
4,My elderly parent loves it,"My elderly dad had back surgery and can bend down to pick up stuff he constantly drops on the floor. This grabber is a huge benefit for him. His favorite use, grabbing an ice cream bar from the ground level freezer drawer :)Only problem - during his bad arthritis (in hands) days he can't quite squeeze the handle's trigger."
3,"Carex 26""EZ Grabber","Works as it should; but the grabbers don't open enough to fit around jars such as peanut butter, Mayo., raisins, etc... Once you can get it around a can, jar, or whatever; then place it where you want, you can't release the grabber ends from the item. It works great for cans and such that are no larger than a regular 16oz is in diameter."
5,grabber review,"This is a much better designed grabber than the ones I have had in the past and that lasted about 2 months. the bend so it can fold 'feature' is the weakness of the others. Folding is not a useful option, especially when that is where it breaks.The products came in more rapid time than stated."
2,Ez Grabber not so Ez to rotate,"I work for a company who displays this product in the store. I was attempting to sell it to a customer who asked me to show how the Ez Grabber rotates 90 degrees. Not only could I not turn the product, I lost the sale as well. I have since taken the item off the floor and will not recommend it to my customers. It works well to pick up items, but trying to turn a square peg in a round hole is not that Ez."
3,Hell Hath no Fury like An Ex-Commie Scorned!,"While I definitely agree with horowitz on (and have experienced first hand)the extreme toxicity of the left-I'm not paying for any more recycled chapters! Also I am not a neo con and can't take their hypocritical support of the most monstrous affirmative action project of all time: Israel. While I seriously agree with him on the black power movement's ""fatuous"" and dangerous racialism-his obsession with anti-semitism and categorical support for Israel give him no room to talk. His ""intrusions of ego"" as some conservatives have labeled his work are tiresome, and his is just a sickly hungry wounded ego I have no desire to feed any longer. For Example, Horowitz's obsessive (which seems to be his most overriding and monotonous trait) self-pitying ruminations about his family just really aren't that interesting.Definitely check this book out-I wouldn't buy it."
1,The pitter-patter of little minds....,"Like a white, suburban feminist of the '70s who becomes 'born again' into Christian fundamentalism and writes to expose the errors of feminism as a whole (leaving out the experience, knowledge, and insights of the bulk of the tradition), Horowitz accomplishes something, but far less than he or his celebrators would have you believe. Ultimately, that the political left is 'owned' by the communists/fellow travellers of his past is the underexamined assumption that underpins too much of his analysis. While many of his insights are spot on, they exist in a disjointed series of isolated critiques that he and his editors attempt to link together into a (illusionary) unified whole. While it's not clear how much of this book is mere self-therapy for its author,it does manage to provide warm fuzzies for ideologues on the right, a cathartic punching-bag for stridents on the left, but precious little for the masses who have to live in the middle."
2,The well that never runs dry,"For the umpteenth time, Horowitz explains his transformation from an egomaniacal left-wing statist into an egomaniacal right-wing statist."
5,Should Be Required Reading for College Liberal Arts Courses,"Horowitz has edited a chronological sampling of his most provocative essays over the past forty years. Both the tone and spirit of this compilation is intellectually honest, tracing his transformation from leftist radical to moderate conservative. More importantly, he reveals the hypocrisy and arrogance of the left, especially its socialist fringe, and he challenges university faculty to reexamine their own assumptions and practices about academic freedom of speech. As a former liberal myself, I can relate to much of what he says. If only those who once embraced him on the left and in the media would give him the same benefit of the doubt now."
2,"Yay, Cool Powerz!","I appreciate all the cool powers in the WoD, but this book exists solely to give big vampires big powers and show them off. Methuselah's of course exist and I won't deny they're awesome might, however the WoD has far more depth than this book presents (not asking for perfection either) and while I think it's a decent read for a different genre, the WoD is lost."
5,THE RED DEATH BURNS UP THE PAGES,"This is an amazing series of books, for fans of the World Of Darkness or just fans of Vampire stories. It is definately a page-turner. The concept of the Dark Messiah and a vampire that contols fireis wonderful! And set in my hometown at that. Mr. Weinberg definatly did his research on DC. I am currently rereading this series for the 5th time. It will keep drawing you back every time. Relearning the secrets is half the fun!"
5,The Blood War Trilogy was a great page turner!!,These books were a great read! They made you want to keep reading and reading non-stop just to find out what would happen next. He let you get to know all the characters well but still left them mysterious and interesting. I highly recommend these books!
4,Not the best...but worth a read!,"I devoured this book fairly quickly, and came out pleased, but not amazed. No offense, but WOD books aren't exactly known for being best sellers for a reason...however, even though this book isn't great, its not too bad either. Worth a read, for sure. I think that my issues with it were the fact that there were so few humans involved in its plot, and the ending was horrid. The ending was laughably poorly executed. ""Blood War"" is written fairly well, however its action scenes are a tad boring & slow, not dramatic enough. My favorite character was the Nosferatu living in Paris. I ordered all three in this series, and am very pleased to see that this Nosferatu is one the cover of the 2nd book...hopefully this means that there will be more of him when I start reading it. Anyway, very good as far as WOD books go, just don't come in expecting an Ann Rice."
4,Bloodwar,"Excellent writing and character style. I read this one first and was happy that i wasn't completely lost as can sometimes happen.This is also my first clan novel and i found the story and history intriguing.Horror novels never give me the creeps ,but the characters were so vivid that i succumbed to the fear."
4,F&S - Better than S&M!,"""Gentlemen Prefer French and Saunders"" is truly the best of the 4 F&S DVD's. I bought the ""Set"", and what a bargain! I watched the first three DVD's today, and laughed for hours. If you are looking for some silly, yet witty entertainment I suggest these DVD's. I have begun to refer to F&S as ""Monty-Pyfemme. A wonderful addition to my growing BBC DVD library! Make sure to watch the bonus sections - usually they are the best parts."
2,disappointed,A big fan of dawn french. I am a life-time fan after the vicar of dibley series. i had problems enjoying the very dry humor of this dvd and the differnt sketches. it would be nice to see dawn french in another tv series.
3,OK,"I would recommend this for hard core fans of French and Saunders. It's funny, but it's not as good as At The Movies or Living in a Material World."
4,Potato chip editorials.,"I am not a frequent Christian radio listener, so my first exposure to Charles Colson's ""BreakPoint"" is through this collection of the commentator's first year or so of on the air editorializing. The comments are gathered together in chapter groups that revolve around similiar themes, thus making subjects you would like to focus on easier to find. The shortness of the commentary makes for a quick, yet informative, read. Just be forwarned, reading A Dance with Deception is like munching on a bag of Lay's Potato Chips, once you start nibbling you will find it almost impossible to stop with just one. Recommended."
5,Great reading,How do I get in touich with Chuck Colson. I would like to invite me to speak at our District event
1,AGGGGGGGH! My Eyes Are Bleeding!,"This doll is so ugly. Looking at it makes my eyes hurt. Why in the world are her hands and feet so big (they look like monkey hands and feet). I mean the Bratz kind of have big feet too, but NOT LIKE THIS! This doll is hideous. I would never pay $49.99 for this piece of my scene crap!!"
1,Scary!,"I saw this doll in the store and was scared by it, and I'm not a kid. I usually love My Scene dolls but this is just hideous. Mattel should've done some consumer testing before they decided to sell this. If they did do some consumer testing, what were those consumers thinking?! Her head just doesn't look right with her body. They should've made the whole doll out of the same material, either all soft or all hard vinyl. This is the first time I've given a one star rating to anything and I think this doll definitely deserves it. I gave it 5 stars for durability because it looks durable, but I can't imagine any kid would want to play with this."
5,Shes SOOO COOL!!,"Excuse me, but you are all just WRONG saying shes ugly, useless and rubbish!! When dad bought this for my birthday, I played with Her 24 7! I even took her to school!! Is there a chealsea one because I searched for her. But you should just buy her because shes wicked."
1,Whats the Point?,"This doll is nice for younger kids, but who want to play with a mutated doll?? Her hands her feet and all her other bodyparts are horribly ugly. Only a dorky young, doll-obsessed freak would buy this junk and i think it should be recalled. My dog almost choked on the hand because he ripped it off. It should be more durable and better looking."
1,LOVE TO DO DOLL HAIR,I DIDN'T BUY THIS THIS BUT WHO WOULD. IT'S THE UGLEST THING I HAVE EVERY SENN BESIDE THOSE CHEAP DOLLS. THIS IS NOT WORTH 49.99:( :( :(
1,This doll stinks and you know it,"You all know that this doll is ugly. You can't stand the fact that My Scene dolls actually look ugly. And you also know that Bratz dolls are better. After all, they are made like they are brand new. And MY SCENE dolls look like they are cheaply made and fopund in a dumster. My Scene dolls are no good copycat ugly dumb dolls with no sense of fashion. This doll is ugly and use your brain people. This doll is ugly not pretty. Bratz are 10000000% better anyways. and they always will be. Scurl yal My Scene fans. Go Bratz fans. Bratz rule My Scene drule. Bratz won My Scene lost. Ha."
4,"Good Anime, better animation!~","As far as mech-fighting is concerned, this rather tame, and the storyline is not too great. But it's also not too bad.The animation is top-notch, the characters are cute and funny, the music is great, and overall this is a decent anime. I was expecting more fan service and was happy that they kept it under control, as it kept the story on a more serious note. Definately worth at least 21.99."
2,old design but good carry case,"Milwaukee Tools makes great cases and often excellent tools but these are an exception. Carbon steel cutting blades dull quickly and chip if a nail is hit. They take about as much drill power as a regular hole saw and chew up batteries just as quickly.Problem with all these selfeed drill bits is that the lead in screw thread is a compromise, too fast for some wood and too slow for others. When it is too fast as with hard woods the bit jambs and then the drill spins in the opposite direction which is no fun with a 1/2"" stud drill.For holes smaller than 1"" I prefer the wood augers and for bigger holes the big gullet aggressive hole cutters like the Milwaukee Hawg and the Blue Boar (many more sizes than the Hawgs) make drilling faster and I get a lot more holes per battery charge. Actually use a 18v DeWalt 970 drill instead of the old stud drill most of the time."
4,Pretty Good,"Overall this is a great product. They drill really fast and do the job right. I will agree though at times when your drilling through a stud that towards the end, when the spur is past the end and already sticking out of the other side, you do have to put alot of pressure on the bit in order to finish drilling the hole. Compared to what these bits do for me, this minor setback really doesn't bother me at all. These bits will not cut through nails so what I like to do is carry an extra set of bi-metal hole saws to cut out the nail then go back to using these bits because they're alot faster than hole saws."
4,A classic romance,I really enjoyed this book. I read it in one day was just too hard to put down. It was so sweet. Jeremy was just dreamy. Someone I would be in love with in real life. Livvy was not over the top just wanted to enjoy her independence. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a soft romance. ****4 stars
4,Enjoyable,"I found the hero in this book to be refreshing. Unlike the typical rake or man about town, this hero hasn't spent a lot of time ""loving"" his way through the ton. His wife died and he hasn't felt an interest in anyone since meeting the heroine. Three years later, he feels that spark again, not realizing that she's the woman he had met previously at a masked ball.I also liked learning about the fate of foundlings during this time of history. We know that there were orphans and orphanages, but understanding that a thing like adoption did not exist was interesting. All in all, this was an enjoyable, well-done book."
3,somewhat unbelievable,"I really thought I would like this, but it was hard to imagine a woman (widow no less) completely shunned by society because of a kiss?! Especially when money is involved (she is not poor). Then when our hero comes to her house she really thinks after all this time he has come to claim her, but then won't defend herself or tell him who she is once she realizes he doesn't have a clue.I give it three stars as I loved the premise, and enjoyed the book, I just found myself wanting to skip through parts at times due to how much she allowed others to walk all over her."
3,Some unique aspects to a common storyline,"The story was good, but I felt it made too big a deal about the scandal. It seems every other Regency/Victorian romance falls back on a heroine (usually innocent) ruined by scandal. There were some unique aspects to this story, though, involving orphanages, adoption, and childbirth. And the male lead was a respectable gentleman, not the usual rake."
3,Made my work day go by,"Given the price, it was all right. I didn't find the plot very original or very realistic for that matter. Overall, it made my very boring work day go by a bit quicker.I was not impressed by it."
3,Can't put my finger on it . . .,"This book was okay. I can't really say why I wasn't thrilled, maybe because I just finished a great book (Amy Atwell - Ambersley), but it was boring. I kept putting it down and then forcing myself to go a little further. If you're looking for something thrilling, keep looking. But, if you're looking for a book to fill some time, this wasn't bad."
3,Interesting beginning but didn't finish it.,"I gave up on this three quarters of the way through. I found the plot too irritating. The ""scandal"" surrounding Lady Dearing was ridiculous considering she was a widow and the intrigue towards the end was just too unbelievable."
3,I didn't love this one,"I found this one a bit boring- both of the main characters were so NICE that it was a bit uninteresting. The heroine adopted orphans, the hero worked on the board of the hospital/orphanage. Her reputation had been unfairly soiled and he was afraid to become involved with her because of her awful reputation. I like a hero with a little backbone, who isn't worried about what his aunt thinks of who he is courting. Going to the masquerade seemed like the only interesting thing either of them had done in years. I love interesting characters that I would like to hang out with, and these two seemed pretty dull to me."
4,Very pleasant read,"This was a surprise for me to enjoy that book so much. Without revealing anything about the plot or the end, I can only say that I would recommend this book."
2,"Plot, Sound, and Picture are all flawed.",The plot of this movie is poorly written. The landlord of an apartment building is harrassed by tenants who start fires in the building by smoking and vandalism. The arson activity is justified by the dwellers of the building as retaliation for the condition of the buiding. None of the tenants has bothered to complain to the landlord or file a complaint with the city until after one of the residents sets fire to the building. The picture quality was just passable and the sound had background problems on the vhs copy from Vci. This may have been due to the fact that this was a Paramount film from the 1930's.
5,I love thisssssss,"I bought this for my friend that loves cows AND bakes. I reeeally hope she likes it as much as I do. It's sooo cute, it's a great price and I got it in less than 24 hours! Super duper happy!"
1,Not so happy...,"Fun, yes, but after the first wash they don't hold their shape and I actually have a hard time getting my hand in the right way because of its disformation. I wouldn't buy again...unless it is to merely hang and look at. But for a decoration it is great."
2,Do not try this in the kitchen!,"This is well constructed and cute as the dickens, but IT WILL NOT protect you from burns!First time I tried it I nearly dropped a hot pan on the kitchen floor!It insulates better than a tea towel but not by much. Do not buy this if you intend to use it in the kitchen. It makes a nice decoration though."
3,It's Bacon,"I simply wanted the book to do my research on the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth, Francis Bacon, who wrote not only most of the Shakespeare works, but also translated and encoded the King James Bible. But this wasn't enough for such a great man. He also invented the Scientific Method! How did he do all this? He was a mystic! He was a Rosicrucian and had access to so much more then most men and women have even a hint of an idea unless they be open to new ideas.Frat Bacon did put his mark in this book marking him as the author. The word is a Latin word ""honorificabilitudinitatus."" Francis Bacon planted that word in this book and also in his notes. This plus the numerous numerical codes throughout all of his works.A great explanation may be found here"" [...]"
4,no leak so far!,"started using it for my pregnant wife who can't sleep on flat mattresses. it's holding up fine since using it a week ago. not recommended for two people to sleep on it since the firmness is they will ""converge"" in the middle after some time... for me, it's fine since it was bought to sleep only one person."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,There is nothing to offer from this book. The codes which you have to spend hours to download from the author website are so buggy and slow. This book is simply one of those that should not have been published.
5,Buy It!,"This book was written in the early 30s, and the ironic thing is that everything he writes about is still true. There is something for everyone in this book, long term, short term and beginning investors. The author discusses money management, strategy, and investor psychology. I read quite a few books on the market, and there are very few that in my opinion deserve a 5 star rating."
2,God awful,"I was excepting this to be a good CD after reading all of the glowing reviews - but this disc stinks! I love trance, but this CD is track after track of repetitive air-raid sirens. It is not music, but annoying noise. Try anything by Nick Warren instead."
5,excellent indie album,"This album could be one of 2006's best releases. It's intricate, broad, evocative musical strokes are fantastic. These guys are one of the better groups in the modern legion of indie rock. this album is definitely worth your money."
5,Got to hear this,"The Dell Vikings have to be the best of the Acapella ""50's"" groups. Thier music is the pace setting style to judge all others.If there is just one album you have in your collection of this style of music THIS IS IT. The only thing you have to do is play several of thier cuts to hear the best of the BEST.I feel you can't get better Do-Wop and street music than this. I have been looking for this group since 1967. This is a truly a great find. Cuts like ""Come Go With Me"", ""Whispering Bells"" and others you will remember are only the tip of what they can do. If you don't find songs like ""Senorita"" bringing you way back, you just will miss the best of what the ""50's"" had to offer."
4,a nice book for Taber fans,"I love Gladys Taber's Stillmeadow books and I also love to cook, so owning this book is a natural fit for me. In fact, I'm the type of cook who enjoys ""reading"" cookbooks, and this one is no exception because Gladys sprinkles her warm comments and anecdotes about where or when or how she served the recipes throughout the book. The recipes themselves are perhaps a bit ""dated"" relative to how we eat today, i.e. I think our food culture has changed with the times so that we generally enjoy stronger and more exotic flavors than are represented in this book. But still there are a lot of good, easy-to-make recipes that many people will enjoy."
3,Bedhead Shine Mist,This product is ok. Expensive and really didn't make my daughter's hair shine all that much. Just an ok product!
5,Good stuff!,"I have used this product for years. I have naturally curly, very very curly, thick hair. I use a flat iron to straighten it. This product is awesome to take away frizz, smooth your hair, and make it shine. I was purchasing it from my hairdresser for around $10-$12 a bottle. Amazon was half the price for the same amount of product. Genuine brand, not a knock off. Highly recommend."
4,Ancient voice,"At first this music may seem a little commersial, countrylike, but when listening to the lyrics and the way Dougie MacLean performs the songs, it's like listening to a voice from forgotten times, when man and nature was close and connected. Beautiful songs, lovely voice, but not too sweet to sound authentical. My favourites are ""Feel so near,"" and ""Caledonia."""
1,An album for coma sufferers!,"I have been acquainted with Dougie's music for some years. His best period was in the early 90's when his band had some talent. I have never cared much for his lazy languishing vocals, but this album will bore you in to a coma. No wonder he has slipped into obscurity."
4,Good Substitute for Boss ME-50 FS-6 Footswitch..,"First off, no Boss or Digitech foot pedal is worth $35-$50, when you can build one easily for $20 or less. With that in mind, this pedal is another option for your Boss ME-50 multi-effects pedal, this one having three buttons instead of the two foot switches on the FS-6. This pedal used to be silver and blue, but has the same configuration, so if you come across one in good condition, they're the same. In memory mode the up/down momentary buttons are functional to change bank numbers, and in manual mode all three buttons work to turn on/off the compressor and/or tone modify settings (turn on/off each one, turn off both of them, toggle between them). This footwitch itself is fairly sturdy, but if you have a habit of kicking the switches sideways or putting your full weight on one you might be replacing the switches on a regular basis."
2,Digitceh foot controller,I bought it for my old Digitech digital delay as a foot control option. Controls some aspects of the unit but doesn't shut the unit off completely by footswitch as I had hoped. Still learning what it DOES shut off.
2,Run Come Save Me,"Roots Manuva is ok at best. His sounds reminds me of a slower less interesting, original or innovative Wyclef Jean. I love Wyclef's music and Roots just seems like a weak English biter of Clef's sound."
2,Run Come Save Me,"ok...the album's alright, nothing special- as good as any other hip hop album at the moment. I just think that Roots Manuva is soooo pretentious. He goes around thinking he's some kind of international rapping superstar like eminem- well he's far from it. grrrr......"
4,Rodney Returns!,"Along with Slick Rick and Tricky, Roots Manuva is the biggest MC's to ever come out of the United Kingdom, but still remains relatively unknown on this side of the pond. His MCing is a gritty combination of dancehall toasting, and old-school rhymes, overlaid with pure abstraction. On ""Run Come Save Me"", Roots Manuva picks up where he left off on 1999's ""Brand New Second Hand"", and displays an incredible maturity and knack for crafting rhymes while remaining inherently true to his British roots. This album swiftly breezes through many styles, including (but not limited to): chopped up booty 2-step (""Bashment Boogie""), traditional US style hip-hop (""Join The Dots"" featuring Jurassic 5's Chali 2na), experimental electro-grooves (""Hol' It Up""), and lots of funky breakbeats colliding with dancehall inna dub style, all given a soul by Manuva's guttural stammer, coming thick with a UK accent. Cheers for England."
4,Inspired though inconsistent,"'Run Come Save Me' is a landmark in not only UK hiphop but hiphop in general, as it is very different to anything else you will come across in its whole approach. Unfortunately the incredible songs are the obvious ones - 'Bashment Boogie', 'Witness', 'Join The Dots', 'Sinny Sin Sins' and 'Dreamy Days' - and the other tracks are merely good. If Roots Manuva had made a 12-track album of this quality, it would have been incredible, but at an overlong 17 tracks some of this is down on standard, though there are no bad tracks. Roots Manuva is lyrically acute as on 'Sinny Sin Sins' which sums up the problems with organised religion extremely articulately, and he also crafts some exciting sounds blending his unique, British rapping voice to influences of ragga, garage and Afro-Caribbean sounds, while staying 100% hiphop. It may not be flawless, but he's a major talent who one day could easily make an album that is."
3,Angkor and the Khmer civilization,"The title ""Angkor and the Khmer civilization"" is misleading in that sense this book treats the Khmer civilization from the prehistory to the 21st century in mainland South East Asia. In this specific context this is an interesting book. In the context of the Khmer civilization restricted to Angkor I would recommend Charles' Higham ""The civilization of Angkor "".The Civilization of AngkorCambodian Architecture: Eighth to Thirteenth Centuries (Handbook of Oriental Studies/Handbuch Der Orientalistik)The Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia: From 10,000 B.C. to the Fall of Angkor (Cambridge World Archaeology)The Khmers (The Peoples of South East Asia and the Pacific)A History of Cambodia"
5,A must have for any workshop.,"These blades have been used many, many times and have yet to let me down. A great value for the money."
4,Great price.,"I got these at a great price. My husband really goes through these blades. We have tried many different types from different companies and these hold up pretty well. I bought these last March and he has just about gone through all of them now in December. He owns his own auto repair shop and they get used almost daily, so it may not seem like 9 months is a long time, but when you consider the heavy workout they get it is. They are good quality blades that he has never had a problem with. They are generally less expensive then other brands as well. I am only giving it 4 stars because I would like to see the blades last a bit longer even with the heavy use. I will purchase these again and again and probably again."
3,Good but I miss the old Eddy!,"As a veteran fan of the show from its inception, I found the fourth series to be a bit less funny...although ""Fish Farm"" and ""Small Opening"" were my favorites (Patsy in Manson garb was too funny!) Eddy and Patsy are both still looking great and Patsy especially seems more sophisticated and ""mellowed out.""I do think that the segment with Sarah's ""chemical peel"" was unnecessary, and I am not sure what the purpose was for this since I try to like Edina despite her self-absorbed persona. And for some reason she does a lot of yelling in the ""Menopause"" episode instead of being humorously agitated like she was before. Overall I really enjoyed the first three series more but I found some good things in these as well."
3,"Good action, poor editing, silly subplot","This book has an interesting premise that is not too unbelievable. It is a fast read that can be finished in a long evening. I enjoyed the battle scenes and the writing about naval life and issues. But, I agree with another reviewer that the subplot involving the girls was not only unbelievable as a concept, but the girls act and talk like ignorant and oversexed 13 year olds. The writing about the subplot was juvenile, and some of the non-battle dialogue among the crew was stagy, artificial, and stilted. Overall, though, an enjoyable book if you can get past the bad editing (how could that happen?) and the irrelevant subplot. I hope that this author keeps writing, but sticks to the military aspects of his stories. I was truly engaged and interested in the dilema of the officer in charge and in the battles against superior odds, which were handled very well. The best parts of this short book were reminiscent of Dale Brown's military aviation novels."
4,OUTSTANDING original story!,"Great story and action, we needed a 400 page book to complete the story. The ones who complain about the ladies,,,,,,, they were there and history will not print it. The book is a very good read to the ones that know,remember,and wish. The editor needs work as well as the cover artist. Dan needs to be cautious of this reception and remember that a few that were there read his book. As I said before, this story needed 400 pages or a sequel or a scenario of another ship making the sortie out to sea."
1,"VERY poorly edited, and almost juvenile in the writing","If you do not mind dozens, nay, hundreds of ""typographical"" errors, then this is the book for you. Wrong words (wondered instead of wandered, etc.), mis-spellings, and many,many,many misplaced and overused commas all detract from the reading. The premise is interesting -- although having one ship (albeit the WeeVee) take out four Japanese carriers, two battleships and other varied craft does seem a bit much. Artistic license, perhaps, but wouldn't it have been great to have this ship in the ""real"" war...... And the ""sub-plot"" of the four girls on board was ridiculous. Sorry, I guess it got my back up to see such an incredibly poor job of editing."
3,Not up to Schaum's standards,"This book is *ok*, but it is not as good as the other Schaum's books that I own (I own nearly 20 of them). I recomment this book ONLY if you are studying high school economics. If you are in college (or taking AP Economics or studying for CLEP), get the Microeconomics and Macroeconomics versions of this guide."
2,Disappointing,"I used Schaum's Oulines to study for my accounting CLEP test, preparing for my MBA program. The Financial and Managerial Accounting titles were excellent. I have also used them to supplement my MBA texts in Operations Management and Financial Management. Overall, the series is lucid and easy to follow. I was expecting this title to follow suit.Unfortunately, it did not.The exposition is shoddy at best. Though I could solve the problems as they were given, I found myself struggling to understand economics. Since I was studying to CLEP test out of my prerequisite Micro and Macro Econ, I was concerned. After a few weeks, I purchased Harper Collins' College Outlines' Intro to Economics, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could understand economics."
2,Corny and over the top,"These ideas seemed corny to me and way over the top, seeming to take focus out of the wedding and more onto how to entertain your guests rather than emphasize the marriage of two people on an already special day."
2,Wedding Ideas,"I found the title of the book to be somewhat misleading. When I actually got it and looked at it much of it seemed to ""Fairy-tale"" like to be feasable for the common person. It ws nice however to see some of the ideas....I just thought it was more of a book for ideas and tips to make a wedding perfect."
2,Woefully dated,"Superb cast, master director, good screwball premise, and......pfffft! This odd-couple comedy is skewered by its smirking view of sex roles, whereby the mink-clad heroine will go faint at a boxing match (is this Lauren Bacall?), and her macho mate will question the masculinity of a Broadway choreographer. And I'm afraid we can't share in the delight the film takes in making sport of a punch-drunk, washed-up boxer. (Now we know punch-drunk means brain-damaged). Notable only for the saucy performance of Dolores Gray, and an alley fight scene where the incredibly fey (but agile) Jack Cole knocks out an entire screen full of hoods. Otherwise, a misfire."
3,Pedestrian Effort,"Perhaps this is trying to look like the 1965 set with the flag. The pictures and design of this set just seem lame to look upon. It does contain 28 Hall of Famer and 10 members of the 3000 Hit Club. #1 Draft Picks are noted, few of which made it to MLB.There are turn Back the Clock cards and All-Star cards. To get gem mint cards from the box would be a nice experience. However, other cardmakers were already putting pictures on the backs of cards. By this point Topps had fallen behind in creativity. Features one Hall of Fame rookie,1989 Topps Baseball Randy Johnson Rookie Card."
1,This toy doesn't work,The ink cartridges had very little ink when opened and what little sprayed out did a poor job. The manufacturer has not reponded to a request for replacements.
3,Fun for 5 minutes,"My daughter really wanted this toy, and her Uncle got it for her. She has played with it acouple of times, but mostly its been sitting on the shelf. I wouldn't recommend it. Its very cheap feeling toy with little educational or fun value to it."
1,Doesn't work at all,"This toy has not worked since the day my daughter received it from a relative. The head on the airbrush is different than the advertisement. I wish I could get the money back that was spent on it. It is a big disapointment. We have tried everything from wetting the markers, to taking everything apart.[...]"
1,This toy didn't work,I tried to use this toy and it wouldn't work. I put the markers in the airbrush tattoo and none of the ink even sprayed out. I ended up just using the markers with the stencils. My mom was mad that she spent [$$$] on this lame toy.
2,OK TOY,"I got this toy as a gift. I opened the marker and when it touched my skin, it didn't come off with water. I had to use rubbing alchahol to get it off. It still hasn't come off fully. I made a tatoo and about an hour later it was still smudging. The tatoo stencils are easy to come off the paper and put on your skin, but the stencils get the ink on them and then that gets on your hands. The stencils don't go back on the paper either. The tatoo maker comes only with girl tatoos which is a problem because boys might think that this tatoo maker is cool, too. I had to put band aids over the tatoo when I went to bed because it was still smudging. The machine is very loud. It takes 4 C size batteries. It's durable, that's the only good thing about it. I wouldn't waste my money, or my parent's money on this. Just a word of warning- It's not that much fun!"
1,This toy is the worst toy I ever had!I,"This toy is the worst.I wanted this toy because it looked cool and i had a buniess in my school and i know people would love it.That was not cool the airbrush is hard to put back in the holder,the tatoo does not dry,It's hard to get the ink out of the airbrush.The tatoo maker has alot of problems that I would say but it is too moch to say so I do not recomend this toy,but I do recomend the lip gloss maker."
1,WASN'T WORTH MY MONEY !!!!!!!!!,"JUST WANTED TO TELL EVERYONE THIS TOY IS NOT WORTH IT AS YOU SEE ON THE COMMERICAL IT SPRAYS OUT THE INK OFF THE MARKER WELL IT DIDNT DO THAT ON MINE ALSO IT DIDNT SPRAY OUT ANY INK TO MAKE THE TATTOO SO I MY DAUGHTER GOT NO TATTOO. VERY UPSETTING IT JUST DIDNT WORK. THE STENCILS ARE STICKERS THEY ALL RIPPED ALSO THE GLITTER RUB OFF ANY INK THE WAS ON HER, AND ITS LOUD , NOISEY , ANNOYING.. TO SUM IT UP ITS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY AN IT JUST NOT A GOOD TOY !!!!!!!!!"
3,Deceptive,"I live in Brazil and asked a friend to mail it for me. The toy has a nice layout, but the pens get dry and the toy does not work. WHen you put them in the water it works as said in the instruction manual, but the tattoos are very easy to become blurred.I do not recommend."
1,Does not do what it says.,I bought this for my daughter who is 11yrs old I thought it would be fun well when you put the marker (comes with 5) in the air brush it does not work we tried putting water on the tip like it said and that did not work I guess I should not expect that much for the price I paid but I think I could have bought some stencils and markers for less than this. It was very disappointing.
1,SHOULD NOT BE SOLD,"This product does not work- might as well blow ink through a straw at your child.Took 30 minutes to get it out of the packaging and load it up with batteries. Child was so excited - and then cried when she saw it make a fuzzy, smeary, stainy mess on her skin.Companies that have no retail presence can make crap like this cause you can't return them once you've opened the box."
3,The ink should last longer,I found this produgt to be annoying because just when you are starting to have fun with your friends and giving everyone a tattoo the ink starts to dry up and then you have to dip the tip in water. While doing this the ink now longer lasts as long and the pens dry even faster. I also wish that there were more colors of pens and different packages of tattoos.
1,let down,i purchased this for a birthday present and the batteries but the airbrush sprayer did not do anything at all.we had to end up using the stencils and markers. do not buy this .It is a comlpete joke.They should only sell the markers and stencils!
3,ok in the box,"I have this tatto maker and me,my sis,and mom think it is fun but there is one problem with this tatto maker that it is fun but the pens lose a lot of ink when you dont use it a lot thats probley why i have it stuffed in my closet it would be cool if it had letter stincils and you can tatto your name but whats funny it can make a good prank like one time i put atatto on my dad that said ""girls rule"" when he was sleeping and i also think it should come with more colors to make the tatto loke like it is soposted to loke like a broken hurt that haves red and black tatto."
2,my niece loves it anyway,"Okay, the idea for this tattoo airbrush machine was cute, but it did not really work that well. first of all, it is almost impossible to use more than one color at a time because the airbrush has such a wide spray. Second, the ink does not dry well. Basically, the ink never dried. If you wiped the tattoo, the ink would smudge even after 5 minutes of dry time. This would not be so bad if the instructions did not say that the ink should not get on any clothing as it will not wash out. The ink never dries, so unless your kids don't wear clothing, it WILL get on their clothes and never come out."
3,Disappointed & Beware Refills aren't available,"I bought this toy for my daughter 4th birthday , what seemed to be a great pressie turned out to be something else, the pens were dry and needed to be dipped in water to work, which ends up drying the pens out faster, the tattoos stencils were stickers that broke easily and after a few uses can't be used again, My problem is that it indicates that refills are avaliable for this item.. umm i live in Australia and there are no refill items avaliable for this product here what so ever and the company seems to not return calls or email. If any one knows anywhere i can purchase these no matter where in the world please email me on (...)it would be appriecated .. For anyone considering purchasing one of these . its really not worth the money and if you do make sure you can get the refill packs as once the pens are dry and the tattoos no longer stick you might as well throw the entire unit away"
1,mom,"A BIG waste of money. My 7 year old daughter reveived this as a gift last year and we were very disappointed. The markers lasted only for a few tatoos and even when we opened it for the first time, some of them did not even work. The colors of the markers are very faint, and it takes alot of patince to sit and wait for the tatoo to show. They also come off with just water. They claim the tatoos are reusable, but ours kept ripping and after the first use there is no way to store them to use again anyway. We did call the manufacture and they were NO HELP.!"
1,Boooooooooooo!,It's bad.It comes out in a day!you might as well by a pack oftattoo your self.I brought a big pack of tatoos for a 1.00!It came with 50 tatoos!Booooooooooooooo!Hate it.Waste of money.
2,WASTE OF TIME & MONEY.,"This movie had a good plot, but EXECUTED BADLY, AND ENDED WRONG WITHOUT CLOSURE.JUST ABRUPTLY. DID NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE BREAKUP AND GROOM'S MOTHERWAS THE INSTIGATOR IN HIS BREAKUP, BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE BRIDE. EVIL I SAY.Bad players because they ARE NOT ACTORS & ACTRESSES AS WE KNOW GOOD ONES.I KNOW NOW OF THEM HAVE EVER BEEN TRAINED. JUST FRIENDS OR PULLED IN OFF THESTREETS TO PERFORM.CASTING AWFUL: NOT EVEN SEMI-PRO CASTING.PLAYERS WERE AWFUL, NOT THE RIGHT ONE PICKED FOR THE RIGHT ROLES. NONE OF THESEWERE RIGHT FOR THEIR ROLES. WHOLE CASTING NEED TO BE REDONE.A ONE HOUR MOVIE. WHY WOULD ANYONE WASTE TIME TO PRODUCE A ONE-HR. MOVIE. NOT EVENGOOD MOVIE TIME, BUT TOO MUCH FOR AN AWFUL ONE.DELIVERANCE OF THEIR LINES, ALL WERE BAD. NO ONE WAS GOOD."
1,Not the REAL THING,Server Supply is selling a Intel quad card as an NC340T PCI-X 1000T gigabit server adapter. I have purchased this card rom them and installed it in a Proliant DL380 G4 to prove that the HP driver does not load indicating that the card is not installed and the card does not have the HP stickers or branded chip on it. It is NOT the REAL thing!
1,Please read the FINE PRINT.,"This product is listed as ""Enuclene Eye Drops - 15 Ml"" and the description reads: ""For the temporary relief of burning and irritation due to dryness of the eye"". For whatever reason the manufacturer and Amazon felt that description, along with a teensy picture, was sufficient information for the online shopper.However, a closer inspection of the box will reveal what cannot be seen in the photograph: ""Cleaning/lubrication solution for ARTIFICIAL EYES"".I have not used this product to clean any glass eyes so, as ""N/A"" is not an option, my rating applies only to the product information."
4,Why didn't S-K always sound like this?,"Forget the bright and precise sound of old Sleater-Kinney. The raw, snarling, distorted, always-pushing-the-envelope sound ofThe Woods-era S-K blows away everything that came before it.""Entertain,"" believe it or not, is the mellowest song on this EP. ""Everything"" is whatNever Mind the Bollockswould sound like if it had been made by three angry grrrls--including the second coming of Keith Moon, Janet Weiss--instead of a bunch of materialistic punks. Finally, you get a live version of ""The Fox,"" one of the best tracks on The Woods.All in all, a worthy supplement to The Woods."
5,Micromotives and Macrobehavior,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it at least three times and learn something new each time. Schelling is not only a great economist but a great writer. He has a knack for making arcane concepts accessible. I highly recommend it. This book uses economic methodology to tackle ""non-economic"" concepts, such as segregation, sorting and mixing and cooperation."
4,"Somewhat dated, but truly ""essential.""","This is one of the first, most useful books for someone who really wants to learn about beer. It is not fancy. There are no pretty photos of beer or breweries, the writing is to-the-point without much in the way of entertainment. But the information is rich and authoritative. When my friends have sucked Michael Jackson's books dry, and still want more, want to know how to understand the beer they are drinking, this is the book I recommend. Note that I do NOT lend them my copy; I would not want to be without it. The only reason I give the book 4 stars is because it is somewhat out of date. Fred: NEW EDITION!!"
4,A Nice Book,"I've always been fascinated by Colorado and its ghosts towns. This book contains detailed guides to many of the more interesting ghosts towns around Colorado. It also tells a little bit about the history of the towns, which is certainly a bonus. My one complaint is that it was not quite as thorough as it could have been. There were some areas of Colorado with fascinating histories that were left out. But, all in all, this is a good book for anyone interested Colorado and its amazing history. If you like this book, I would also recommend a new gem of a book I found entitled Colorado: Yesterday & Today."
2,Probably Nice For Armchair Visitors,"For people thinking they might seek out these ""ghost towns"" be warned. The definition of ""ghost town"" for the purpose of this book seems to be a town that was once larger than it currently is that has an abandoned building or two somewhere near it. The examples from the book that I've gone to see are pretty much ghost-free small mountain towns filled with more than a few current non-ghost residents. The book makes things appear desolate, and exotic but, for what I've experience so far, it's painting a pretty romantic picture of nothing too exotic."
5,More than Ghost Towns,"This book is a great asset for anyone interested in Colorado histroy. As an avid amateur photographer, I purchased it hoping that I would discover some new places to photograph. However, I got much more.Since the author defines ""ghost towns"" more broadly than many people, his book includes larger towns such as Idaho Springs & Leadville. Each section of the book includes a map showing all the pertinent locations in a given area and gives an in-depth history & description of each, including directions to each."
5,Some great information about the ghost towns of Colorado.,Provides some interesting information about the ghost towns. This book has more meat than many of the others I looked at. It really gives good background information about the ghost towns.
3,The complete series finally available on DVD.,"This is the complete 26 original TV episode of 1970s British television series, finally available in one collection. Previously available were only two episodes on DVD. The show is a bit outdated but the character has indubitably his charme and despite being sometime a bit over the line, Jason King is nevertheless an icon of the 70's. King's choiche of fashion, like his ties matching the shirts are still an absolute statement of style and refinement very seldom encountered today. The quality of the DVDs though is not at his best, no remastering appears to have been done to the original episodes and they look a bit grainy. Nevertheless plenty of episodes to enjoy this character and plenty of memory from the past for those who had seen the series in the seventies."
3,Starts Poorly But Improves,"Unlike the series it spun off of, ""Department S"" (1969-1970), which was filmed in 35mm, and which was evenly balanced from show to show, ""Jason King"" (1971-1972) filmed in 16mm (often looking fuzzy with stale color), is not as well developed from the start, but improves during it's run. The first episode, ""Do You Wanna Buy A TV Series?"", is heavily padded. In the 2 parter, ""All That Glisters"", Jason is a transient in a confusing story about his friend John Mallen, which should have been edited down to a single episode. A turning point is the episode, ""Toki"", where Jason King shows a serious side for the first time. Episodes that follow are generally an improvement. A real problem is that the Jason King character, who showed up sparingly in ""Department S"", as one of four regular characters, can become too much in ""Jason King"", when the scripts are weak."
5,Oops I think he did it again.,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gurney's second Dinotopia book is just as good as the first. The illustrations are wonderful. After reading this, I now know more about the characters in the movie Dinotopia."
5,A well writen book!,James Gurney did a excellent job writing this book. He gives the right amount of detail which visualize what he's writing about. He also makes the book go into a great adventure!
5,Dinotopia review,i purchased this book to replace a lost book from our school library. book in excellant condition. sent promptly to me. excellant price. mailing (packaging) material excellant.
5,Emma rules!,"This is absolutely her best single. We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight is the best song on her album, too. My suggestion is to buy it, if you don't have it yet!"
4,If your buying this above 4$ dont!,"this is an ok single really,it still sound's like the 60's and70's music no actually more like disco.there's not really mutchto say except be careful beacuase you might be tempted to buythis for above 4$ when you see the front cover."
3,"""We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight"" is one of her best nothing compares to anything on ""Free Me""","""We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight"" is one of her best singles from her career thus far, but doesn't stack up against anything on ""Free Me."" This is a better pop tune off her debut album but it lacks the full vocal strength found on her follow up album. The song is good with the high strung acoustic and spanish guitars and the girls night out theme. But the lyrics are somewhat cliched and too much of vocal distortions were used on this song. Also, it seems like her vocals were digitally fixed to sound better than what may have been produced by Bunton, such as to possibly keep her sounding in tune.Overall this is a good song, but of course this song stays well within the realm of radio-friendly pop found during the time period. Bunton's follow up album shows she had a stronger vocal presence with good vocal variations without the need of too much vocal 'help.'"
4,Dangaizer 3,"Same thing as volume 1.Good sentai type movie, the formula of girls fighting girls in sexy outfits work every time. The story, let's face it, it is not an award winning best movie type of thing but, it is ok. Visually it is very enjoyable, buy it if you have the chance."
1,worthless = zero rating,"unfortunately, since you have to assemble the product to check it out -- we assembled it, put things in it, opened the drawer and works like a stuffed cardboard box. WE ARE TOSSING IT AFTER 2 DAYS!"
4,Non-metal Cabinet altered for special application,The storage cube quality was as expected but the opening and closing of the drawer was not as smooth as I would like. I used this cabinet as a catcher for my mail slot so the top were altered. It is a good product for the price.
2,Cute but NOT Comfy,"I LOVE how this shoe looks (got them in purple), but it is not comfortable. I wore them out to dinner and my feet were killing me. The part that hurts is where the elasticized back digs into your foot while walking. I am hoping that they will stretch out because I think these shows are really cute!"
5,extras make the deal,"This is a great set. I like the steamer inserts. A bit of an old fashioned, wobble top steam valve. Old, but proven design (includes two or three weights) to give you a choice for how much pressure you want.Double plus, this easily functions as a good sized stock pot! Bigger is better, I wouldn't go any smaller even for two people. You do want to steam some big artichokes in 8 minutes, right?Gasket seems acceptable or at least it fits well and doesnt' pinch up."
5,Title says it all!,"Great book, full of great exercises to help people brush up on their grammar skills. As an English teacher there are lots of exercises that I can use with my students."
1,Past Participle is not a Verb,"This book would be a decent book if the authors did not insist that a 'past participle' was a verb in the Verbs chapter. A past participle is a word that looks like a verb, but never functions as a verb. It is a verbal. It functions as an adjective. Call it what it is. A participle is an adjective. There insistence that a past participle is a verb is confusing to someone just learning grammar. My advice is to stay away from this book and read someone who understands what Verbs, Verbals, and Adjectives are."
5,Satisified Buyer,Object was received in perfect condition just as described. Shipment was fast. Over all experience with this seller was satisfactory. Will buy again from seller and recommend this seller to others.
2,BIG BEAR WITH SOFT SHOES!,"I AM A FENCE CONTRACTOR IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I WORK WITH 4X4'S, 4X6'S, 6X6'S DAILY. THIS IS A STRONG SAW AND IT CUT'S 4X4'S GOOD, (ONE PASS), BUT 4X6'S AND 6X6'S YOU HAVE TO MAKE TWO PASSES AND THIS IS A HEAVY SAW WHEN YOU HAVE TO CUT 150 POST A SHOT. THE SHOE IS RIDICULOUS. MY SECOND WEEK WITH IT AND I 'VE ALREADY NOTICED IT'S BENT. MILWAUKEE OWN'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MY TOOL BOX, BUT THIS SAW WOULD NOT HAVE MADE ME PURCHASE ALL THE OTHER GREAT TOOL'S MILWAUKEE OFFER'S. "" PUT SOME NEW SHOES ON THE BEAR! """
3,Decent Saw,"I agree with the other raters on this saw. I am a deck contractor and use it to cut 4x6 and 6x6 (takes two passes) posts. The saw has LOTS of power and handles even wet pressure treated posts very well.However, the shoe is a JOKE. It is as flimsy as a $40 Black and Decker circular saw's. Get with it Milwaukee. For this price, the shoe should be MUCH more durable. Hopefully, they will offer a heavier duty shoe as an accessory."
2,contractor-carpenter,"I have bought and used a lot of tools in my day and this saw has to be the poorest designed saw ever. The height adjustment and steel shoe do not keep an setting or adjustment, I think the torque of the saw will even bend the steel shoe. I thought I could live with this problem but I can't. I have owned it too long to return it, is their a modification that can be made if so help. The only good thing about the saw is the name and power.How can I contact the manufacture directly. PS I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought."
3,Good Saw but ...,"The saw is a great saw, but I bought it for my father. A 63 yrs old man, who plans to use it around the house for house work. He complained that the saw is very heavy. when I saw it U listed for 40 lbs. A pretty heavy piece of machinery for around the house. After seeing it for myself and feeling the weight behind that saw, I decided to take it back. A saw at that weight should be a table saw. Although its power was great it wasn't the right fit for around the house use. I went for the 7 1/4"" blabe saw at a much lighter weight. This is a good saw, but I think its intentions are for a little more than around the house."
1,Waste of time,"I am a general contractor with several framers. I bought this saw because of the 15 amp motor which is more than the big foot. The base plate on this saw is useless. It is mounted to the saw at the front with no mounting at the rear like most saws. It is so unstable it will never stay true. You can move the rear of the base plate with your hand up and down 1/2"" with ease. My framers would destroy this saw in days. I made one cut and put it back in the box for return.I give this saw a 1 star, but I give the storage box 5 stars, very nice and sturdy. Some of the box design should have gone into the saw. Can I keep the box?"
1,"SAW NEVER RECEIVED FROM ""SENTIMENTAL COLLECTABLES"" PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON","WE PURCHASED THIS SAW THROUGH AMAZON ON THE 5TH OF DECEMBER, OR THERE ABOUTS, AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. AMAZON HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TRYING TO HELP US RESOLVE THIS, BUT AS TO THIS DAY, JANUARY 6, 2009, AND AFTER SENDING ""SENTIMENTAL COLLECTBLES"" AT LEAST 3 EMAILS ENQUIRING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, ONE THROUGH AMAZON, WE HAVE HAD NO REPLY! THEY HAVE CASHED OUR CREDIT CARD AND HAVE THE MONEY, BUT NO EXPLINATION AS TO WHERE THE SAW IS. AS SOON AS WE RECIEVE IT, OR OUR MONEY RETURNED, I WILL CORRECT THIS, BUT AS OF THIS TIME, I WOULD NOT PURCASE ANYTHING FROM ""SENTIMENTAL COLLECTABLES,"" ON AMAZON OR EBAY...L GRACE"
3,Not exactly a best of...,"A straight reissue of her first and last albums for the RCA label, 1973's ""Eu Disse Adeus"" and ""Poetico,"" from 1982."
3,some damage,It was a little banged up. there were some marks on it that were not described before it shipped. it shipped in decent amount of time. arrived when it was supposed to .
2,I got the lemon and warranty service difficult,"My magnum was hardly used in the 6 months that I've owned it. Hi-Low switch only drives drill when on Hi. Keyless chuck requires a gorilla to tighten bits. During light drilling of softwood, something snapped inside and the motor froze. Obviously something is critically wrong, so maybe I've got the lemon. The local authorized dealer (referred to by corporate offices) claimed to be too busy with their rental service to repair the drill, and they wanted me to pay the shipping to have it serviced at another center which had no telephone or other contact. Corporate offices were business like and rude."
2,poor chuck,"I found that the chuck loosens itself during hammer drill operation, requiring frequent retightening. Personally, I would say the keyless chuck is not worth the extra money. The drill itself seems fine, and I wish I had the normal chuck."
4,Tough,"Bulletproof drill. Have drilled hundreds of holes in concrete walls for anchors etc, Tortured the thing drilling holes into a granite wall - Bits gave up but the drill didn't. Don't hesitate on this one. Keyless chuck is a big plus, very strong grip - sometimes hard to undo. Low-end torque is not as good as I'd like, but torque is not what I bought it for. The other big plus is the Milwaukee removable/interchangeable cords."
5,Great,"I have used this drill on numerous occations and have yet to be discoraged with it's preformance. It is a small yet sturdy drill for: wood, brick, block, and metal. My employer supplies this drill to my coworkers also. I would buy this drill for at home use due to it's many applications."
2,What was I thinking?,"I am a DIYer out of the home that needed a hammerdrill for projects in my basement and brick exterior. I bought this as I thought Milwaukee was ""THE"" tool company. My friend was helping with some tapcon anchors in the basement and was using my very expensive hammerdrill. He criticized it's lack of power and laughed a bit. Came back a few minutes later with a Dewalt hammerdrill. Big difference - much lighter, faster and it doesn;t look so archaic. I returned the milwaukee and just borrow my friends drill now. I did some checking - the Dewalt is cheaper anyways."
1,DeborahNPhx,"I would like to know what songs/titles are on these CD's (no samples?) so I know if I want to order or not. If no samples available, at least let me know what the songs are."
4,Betty is so very fine but,Live at the Donmar has some beautiful songs and while I'm not a fan of Jazz arrangements I do appreciate their quality. But I found the sound mix irritating in that the piano was most always in the foreground and Betty's voice in the background. I prefer the ensemble to be slightly in the background but at least they could have been mixed so as to be equal.
5,Lovely Little Movie,"Hal Holbrook is a icon of the American theatre andcinema, he did not disappoint this time either.The movie is slow moving, which to me was a attributeconsidering the premise of the story...A elderly manwho had lost his wife of many years, put into a nursinghome by his children and his home sold..Well, Mr Holbrooks character wasn't taking that.He give a fierce performance of a elder man who is goingto fight for what he believes is right...The supporting cast was great, Walton Goggins as always gavea A+ performance. Ray McKinnon and Carrie Preston as wellwere on the game...I highly reccomend this movie.THAT EVENING SUN"
5,One great movie,"I don't know why this movie didn't sweep the awards. The movie has great acting and character development. I saw the movie on cable, and liked it so much that I bought the DVD version last week. I've already watched it twice more with friends. Everyone that has watched it with me says the same thing...""That is a great, well-written movie."""
3,Could have been ...,"IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CLASSIC: Hal Holbrook is authentic and wonderful in this movie, and I was pleased that his wife, Dixie Carter (Designing Women), played the role of his wife in the movie. However, I did not know that Dixie died in early April of 2010. ""That Evening Sun"" is a 2009 film based on a 2002 short story ""I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down"" by William Gay. Every opportunity was there for a movie classic and I was disappointed that the dynamics just weren't there in the end. It was no fault of the actors - someone behind the cameras lost their imagination and let it slip through their fingers.It could have joined the beloved ranks of ""Secondhand Lions"", ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"", ""Unfinished Life"" and others that have captured the the hearts and gentle souls of cinema lovers. But here's to Hal Holbrook for another magnificent performance."
1,I love Hal Holbrook but this movie is bad,We kept waiting for the story to develop but it never seemed to come together. Don't bother. This was just a confusing waste of time.
2,That Evening Sun,"I expected this to be better...The story just did not pan out and lacked any emotional depth... This old man leaves The Nursing Home and walks back to his home... When he gets there, he finds out his son has sold the house to this white trash family and they are very mean to him...The old man goes to the shack used for field workers in the past and stays there..even though he is threatened by the family living in his house.. This hit the spot on what children do to their Parents cause they do not want to have them around, nor care what happens to them...We, The Parents raise our kids..sacrifice and love them completely..we start getting old..sick etc and they just abandon us..never call..nor come visit..It is a total shame that elderly people sit in Nursing Homes alone and desolute cause everyone has forgotten them!"
4,Great Educational resource,"I had to read this book because it was a text book of mine in college. I usually never would fully read a text book, but this book made me want to read it. The subjects are intresing and the man who wrote the book is just as interesting, he was my professor."
5,Great Book! Captivating!,"I am really pulled into these books. When I'm done, I'm the one who is ""drowning in memories""!The only bad thing I can think of about this book is that Robin Hobb can't write as fast as I read! (Read it in one afternoon and evening)"
4,Another great book...,"I was torn between giving this book 4 and 5 stars, and ultimately decided on four because it's simply not as good as Ship of Magic.That said, this is a truly excellent book. A few of the little hints and the like dropped at the beginning are a little too obvious, but one gets to wonder if that's intentional.This book maintains the excellent characterization of the previous volume, but far less actually happens in the book. Rather, it's more of a transitory volume: Book one set the stage, this one moves everything to where it needs to be so that Ship of Destiny can come in and tie things up with an amazing ending.Characters are developing nicely, and there is hope for the serpents now as well. Definitely read this book and this series; Hobb is a master artist."
5,Mad Ship,I have read both of the live ship traders books of robin hobb and the whole farseer trilogy robin hobb is a excellent writer and i love all the books she has wrote so far this book is a must read as is all of her books but where is the third one in this series?
5,LOVE IT,I'M ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THIS BOOK AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO GET A FEW FREE MOMENTS TO SIT DOWN AND FIND OUT WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. THIS AUTHOR KEEPS YOU GUESSING AND HAS SURPRIZED ME AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THE UNEXPECTED.
4,Cliffhangers,"I liked this book, so I will tell you what isn't so great about it and the series of which it is a part.Nothing is resolved within any of the individual ""threads"" or at the end of either of the first two books. Clearly, Hobb, like Tolkien and others before her, has created one long novel to be published in parts and neither of the first two parts have anything like endings.That's the main problem. A minor quibble is that the mad ship in the title isn't ""onstage"" all that often.Finally, ""Robin"" is a guy's name.The story is still very intriguing, the characters are colorful and varied and the concepts are wild. But it still doesn't resolve.A suggestion: Buy book one. If you get into it, buy the other two right away so that you don't have to wait for resolution."
2,"Painful, couldn't finish it","The living ship idea is fairly clever, but neither the characters nor the plot ever really engage the reader. I had difficulty keeping track of who was who and the interrelationships among the characters. About half way through the book, I simply threw in the towel, which is rare for me. I've read widely in this genre, and generally insist on finishing a book once I've invested so much time in it. But this one just never gets going. There are some interesting concepts in the backdrop, but the overall story and characters failed to hold my attention."
2,"Compelling but sloppy plot with, once again, no ending!","Magic Ship, Liveship Traders, Bk 1, was a fun read, until you reached the ending and were left hanging for over a year. Then Mad Ship, Bk 2, comes out. The plot does not tie into book 1, as promised. Also, the story is a good read, but again the ending leaves you hanging. These books will best be read when all 3 (including the future promised book 3) are in one book so you don't get left waiting yet another year. This book is a poor way to spend $25."
4,Great 2nd Book in the Series,"It would be fair to say this is another fantastic book, and an excellent addition to the series. However, I believe that without having read the 1st book in the series, it may be a tough slog, not knowing the background.Having said that, though, I believe that is an excellent series for those readers who love getting magnificent detail and really detailed character explanations.I'm traditionally a Science Fiction reader, but this was a fantastic diversion from that sort of Novel."
5,Another great one by Robin.,I was very pleased with this story. Robin Hobb has an amazing way of telling a story with very strong character development. Very few complaints even worth mention.
3,"Awsome plot, Neat worlds, BUT......","The thought, imagination and care that was put into this book shine in its origional ideas,places and the cast of characters.. BUT, while the characters are is interesting they are too... um. annoying? Usually in a good book like in Hobb's other series there is a hero or even some other side char to empathize with, but by the end of the story, I ended up so sick of some of the characters' arrogance, or whining or even their personalities I had to force myself to not skip chapters. The story itself however kept me reading. and I do admit the characters became a more tolerable in the last few chapters."
5,No time for a long review .... must start the last volume in the series : - ),"I am taking a few minutes to write that I throughly enjoyed the second book in the Liveship Traders Trilogy. There is great character and plot development. Many problems come to a head. The logic in the plot may not be perfect but Hobb's skill is such that it didn't matter much to me,Note: There are a number of key plot points that are not resolved in this book, so it is worth investing up front in the last book of the series for those who enjoyed the first book or the first third of this one. Luckily I have the final book in the series next to my easy chair."
3,"Great Band, Not So Great DVD","Like any Train fan, I enjoy their music greatly and particularly like the personality that this live performance shows. I was disappointed, however, with the grainy quality of the video and the hollow sound of the audio, both of which lead me to believe that this otherwise great concert was not captured with high-end a/v equipment. Fans of DVD extras will enjoy the interviews with the band, though I found them pretty short."
4,I'm now a much bigger train fan,"I have always liked the Train songs that you here on the radio and I'm a collector of concert DVD's, but now I have become more of a Train fan. Great concert makes me want to go see them live now, but since they are never in my area this is the next best thing. Video Quality is above average and sound quality is excellent."
4,Nice,"Good concert and nice bonus interviews, which give some background into the band. The interviews are laced with some profanity."
4,Midnight Moon VHS,"I really enjoyed this VHS, it was very entertaining and being able to see Train singing made me a bigger fan of the group if that is possible. I will be viewing it again very soon."
5,Gardening fun,"My four year old granddaughter loves it. She was already ""helping"" her mother garden and now she is very careful using her own garden tools."
2,Poor quality fabric,These pants are constructed from poor quality twill fabric. Save your money and get pants in 65/35 ripstop -- it will be more durable and far more comfortable.
4,Early doo-wop from the masters,"Some jewels here, the Larks began stuck in the 40's with a very forgettable ""Coffee, Cigarettes and Tears"" and it went uphill from there. Gene Mumford's smooth leads are reminiscent of Sonny Til, but he copies no one. ""My Reverie"" is haunting. But I was disappointed this collection did not have the beautiful ""Stolen Love"" which the Larks recorded twice, I believe in '52 and '54. The jump songs are quite ordinarly, but the ballards are great."
2,funny but so so,"This book should not be taken too seriously. It is laugh out loud funny at times, but mostly it seems pretty depressing. Not so much at the author's portrayal of the seniors, but at his lack of ability to successfully get the elderly to talk about meaningful things. He claims that they do not offer him any great wisdom of life, but whenever he does find himself in moments of seriousness, such as when he finally finds out how his roommate's spouse passed away, he is too uncomfortable to pursue them further. Alas, the lack of depth he finds in seniors is not a reflection of those whom he meets, but of himself. But then again, what would you expect from a comedy writer who must constantly attempt to discover the absurd? It is a shame that Mr. Rothman did not have the courage to set aside his silliness at times; it would have given this work a whole new dimension."
2,A ho hum tale of the Jewish after life,"OK, I really meant to read 2008's Leisureville, but this was the only book in the library on retirement communities. I'm over 50, so I usually only read a book if it's free.I wanted to scope out my options for the next decade. But even though Early Bird is non-fiction, it suffers from a dearth of information. It's really a bunch of essays about Rodney Rothman and how he is affected by the mostly Jewish mostly New York seniors around him, who treat him like a 28-year-old visiting son or grandson.Even though well-written, his humor wore quickly. I know a book isn't worth reading when I'm just scanning the pages, trying to find something non-gratuitous to read. I found it 2/3 of the way in, with the chapter ""Basherte"", where he left campus to date women his own age. It was still gratuitous, but at least that chapter was really funny."
3,Lighthearted fun,"I enjoyed ""Memoir"" quite a bit; the rating of 3 stars is a little low due to it being a fairly lightweight book. I chuckled out loud several times throughout the book and Rothman's character descriptions raised good visuals in my mind's eye. There were a few characters that seemed to me to lack a little fullness; although he spent considerable time on his roommate, in the end I felt like there was something lacking. Overall, a very easy and fun read."
1,Shallow Memoir,"I didn't really like this book. It didn't live up to my expectations. It has a quote from Jon Stewart on the cover, and seemed like a good concept, but wasn't that funny. The book doesn't have a good throughline. I imagine Rothman had all this material and it sort of resolved itself into various topics. However he ends one chapter abruptly and begins the next with no bridge between. He has a very dry style, but it comes off as lack of interest rather than wit. There's no sense that he actually cares about trying to get in with the old ladies by the pool, or how terrible his roommates cats are. It seems like he felt like he should write this book, so he did. But he didn't actually learn anything, I don't think. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,"sex, scrod and shuffleboard","Early Bird has all of the makings of a great book-group discussion: an original yet universal topic; memorable characters; excellent writing; and an important connection to broader social issues.After 10+ years of book-grouping, I've noticed that a book that hits all of these bases -- with humor, charm and great sensitivity -- is a rare treat.Early Bird will go down as one of our group's Greatest Hits.Thank you, R.R."
4,Living a Dream... or Reading One Man's Nightmare,"I read a review for this book about a year ago. One of those, if I ever see it, I'll get it. Well, I never saw it and out of sight, out of mind.After some discussions with a friend feeling not unlike the author, I remembered this book and bought 2 copies. I read, thought it was pretty good and have been passing it on and loaning it out ever since.I think it kinda speaks to people the author's age and around. I myself am in my mid-20s and have a hard time grasping the concept of ""40 more years and I can retire.""Reading this book made me laugh and made me realize that maybe I dont have it quite as bad as I thought."
3,Hysterical,"I retired to Florida two years ago and couldn't stop laughing. I am going to buy copies for all my friends that are retiring to West Palm/Boca. Mr.Rothman would make an excellent stand up comic. I read many parts aloud to my husband and he suggested buying extra copies to give as gifts.Although this isn't a ""great"" novel, it is a quick read and something to read by the pool that is mentioned by Mr. Rothman. Not sure if elderly seniors would think it funny, but being a young retired person in Palm Beach, I loved it!"
4,Enjoyable light read,I really enjoyed this book and found myself relating to a lot of what he wrote about. Florida is my favorite state and when I stay there (usually twice a year) I stay with an older friend who lives in one of these retirement communities and I HAVE met the pool ladies! I have felt how he felt many times with trying to fit in when you stick out like a sore thumb! I found myself rolling more than once. Yes he does talk about being Jewish quite a bit but hey! he IS Jewish..so what? Doesn't take away from the tone of the book or what he was trying to prove to himself. This is a good light read!
2,Best for older folks,I didn't find a lot of humor in this book. I have the feeling that the older you are the more you might find this book interesting.
5,Funny and Compassionate,"You will love this book. Well written, good characters, nice mix of facts and anecdotes! Great!"
5,Finally . . . on DVD,"I am so excited that the DVD will soon be available for this wonderful movie. It is one of my top 10 movies that I have been waiting years to come out on DVD. I highly recommend it. Love the dance scene, one of the best movie moments ever. Love the whole quirky, funny, sweet movie!!!!"
4,Cannery Row DVD,"Timely receipt of item was acceptable. Wrapping could have been better, it was flimsy and I felt shipper should have protected the item better. Over all I'm happy with the purchase. The movie is good. I will enjoy watching it over and over again."
5,A Marvelous Adaption,"This film is a marvelous adaption of TWO Steinbeck classics, Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday. The performances by Nick Nolte and Debra Winger are amazing. Nolte's ""Doc"" alternates between compassion and confused intolerance until the final scene. Winger's Suzy is a sincere and sensitive girl forced into prostitution by dire poverty. You will laugh and cry, sometimes both at the same time! The cast of oddballs and unfortunates interacts to provide two hours of unpredictability that finally resolve into a moving and humorous conclusion. The integration of the two books is seamless, you never get the feeling that it is anything but a single story. The story line takes some liberties, but the result is consistently inspired. A memorable movie you will recommend to your friends!!"
5,Great Story,"I looked for this movie on CD for years and when I finally was able to get it I was overjoyed. It is a great movie. Nick Nolte did a really a good job portarying ""Doc"". All the other characters were funny too. It should be a ""classic""."
5,Worth The Time - Superb Price,"Nick Nolte and Debra Winger and superbly believable in their roles and the supporting cast is most excellent, indeed. The story is enticing and the acting is extraordinary. Just relax and allow the story to unfold. Wondrous."
4,Likable Steinbeck Adaptation,"If memory serves, ""Cannery Row"" had a troubled history making it to the screen. Raquel Welch was fired from the film and subsequently sued the studio. A myriad of production and release delays ensued. When it finally made it to theatres it was met with tepid critical and commercial reaction. Viewing it some twenty-five years on my response is that this is a nice film. My only real criticism is that it drags on occasion but sails by on good vibes. The film is populated with affable eccentrics that tug at your heart portayed by terrific character actors like M. Emmett Walsh, Audra Lindley, and Frank McCrae. The central romance between Nick Nolte's Doc and Debra Winger's Suzy is palpable and emits definite electricity. ""Cannery Row"" is a sleeper well worth pursuing."
5,"A Very Well-Made, Amusing and Poignant Film","I think John Steinbeck would have been proud! This is an excellent film that richly deserves the very popular appeal it has received. Characters are interesting, rich and universally well acted. Perhaps, including Nolte's and Winger's best roles. Sets and filming are superbly executed. Film director John Huston's tongue in cheek narration is, again, superb. My congratulations to David Ward! Much like, ""The Crying Game,"" but quite different, this film posseses a heart-felt poignancy that easily outshines all of its amusement. Any notion of refilming this excellent script; that is not quite John Steinbeck's, but rather, based on his characters and off-beat humor, would be akin to a notion of re-editing Brando's, ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" to not include Brando, or re-editing, ""The Misfits,"" to not include Monroe and Gable. PSSSH?"
3,Too Quiet,"For some reason the sound on this DVD is very low. I had to turn the volume up almost as high as my TV goes, just to hear it regularly."
5,Love Cannery Row,"It always seems that when a so-called film critic pans a movie, it turns out to be one of my favorites. Cannery Row is no exception. I need to get a ""fix"" every so often, so I watch Cannery Row. It is my most favorite movie. There is not any part of it that I don't enjoy and even find myself enjoying parts of it that I know are coming up next. I too would love to have it available on DVD format."
5,takes a special day to watch this movie,"I actually have not watched my copy yet. I have seen this movie several times before but I always wait for that ""special moment"" to watch this one. Somewhat like the Jessica Lange King Kong movie. Takes a rainy afternoon for it. But would absolutely recommend Cannery Row. Debra Winger is one of my favorite actresses."
5,Cannery Row,I loved this movie years ago and decided I needed to add it to my own collection. It is pricelsss! Steinbeck at his very best!
5,Great movie - not the best title though,"I wish they hadn't flatly named it ""Cannery Row"". It only bears a minor resemblance to the book, and I think a lot of people were disappointed just because they were expecting a different story line. If you can get past the fact that its not a direct adaptation of the book, you'll see this is a wonderful, enjoyable movie! Its one of my all-time favorites and I'm really happy its finally out on DVD."
1,big disappointment,I saw the movie a few times in the past and loved it but this version has been ruined by all of the deleted scenes. I couldn't make it to the end because there were so many gaps. It now has a PG rating which has taken the heart out of the movie. I won't buy another movie from AMAZON because of this piece of crap.
5,Beautifully done...,"Do yourself a favor...ignore the pompous editorial review (egregious contrivances? verisimilitude?) and watch this movie. The music is wonderful, the characters will stay with you long after the movie, and the sets are imaginative (and by the way, they're supposed to convey the feel of a theatrical production...therefore, they are not egregious contrivances). So what if it wasn't a letter perfect reproduction of the Steinbeck novels? I've read the books and still loved the movie."
3,Cannery Row Review,"After having read Cannery Row by John Steinbeck, I had an idea of what the film version might be like. When I actually watched it I noticed some similarities between the text and the film. I throughly enjoyed the scenes with Mack & the boys because I felt that it captured the essence of those characters that Steinbeck was so detailed about in his writing. The movie version is collaborated with Steinbeck's other book, Sweet Thursday. I haven't read Sweet Thursday, but from what I can tell from the film, it has a good story line. I enjoyed how the filmmakers combined both the story plots into one film. The music that accompanies the characters through out this small town really captures the film's theme of life in their community. I would enjoy seeing a film based soley on Cannery Row's story line, but with all that aside this is a very enjoyable film and I think Steinbeck would be proud of the efforts put into this movie."
3,Release to DVD Please!,"I don't know why Turner Home Video does not release this film to DVD. I've read of the problems when they made the film, Debra Winger replacing Rachel Welch, the court battles, etc.Is the legal wrangling still preventing release to DVD some how? Turner Home Video doesn't provide a ""contact us"" link on their web page or I'd ask them myself. Anyone out there know the scoop?"
4,Cannery Row,In the early '80's I lived in Cannery Row and it was still a bit loony even then. Too get the full impact of the money it helps to read both Tortilla Flat & Cannery Row. The movie captures the tone of the books and the character's personalities very well.
3,Not Exactly The Same,"The movie Cannery Row has the same title as John Steinbeck's novel Cannery Row. Many Characters are identical, but the plot is different. The movie is based on an love story between a girl named Susie that needs a job so badly that she becomes one of the""girls"", how they call themselves. She does not like her job and when she first sees Doc, a man who collects ocean creatures and sells them, just like in Steinbeck's novel, they fall in love with each other. The movie shows not only this love story but also the neighborhood with for example Mack and the Boys. If the movie should be the novel Cannery Row then who ever wrote it made a big mistake, otherwise it is a interesting and likeable movie. To prevent misunderstanding, the movie should have a different title, because it does not correspond directly to the novel."
3,"Good Movie, Better Book...","The movie was really well done, but not an accurate representation of the Cannery Row book, by John Steinbeck. There are many additional story elements in the movie, the characters are different from what you would expect, there are also characters that weren't even in the book, the plot stays the same for the most part with minor alteration. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but I would have much rather preferred a more exact representation of the book, on screen. The actors were great and the plot was strong, Cannery Row the book was better."
1,DVD disaster,The original film was in beautiful widescreen. The DVD is cropped and therefore should be avoided--a disaster and a shame that Warner Bros. couldn't show proper respect to a beautiful film. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Stupid to make Doc a pitcher in hiding!,"I was really excited to see this movie when I found out that it existed. I love both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday and spent considerable time and effort into tracking this down. I was not a fan. Doc has no beard, he is much more callous than he was in the book, they turned him into an ex pitcher who hit the seer in the head with a bad pitch and is now in hiding. Also Hazel is borderline developmentally disabled in this film. Maybe see this if you have not read then books but then go and read the books and be amazed."
3,Cannary Row Review,"I think the book is a nice piece to read. Steinbeck tries to use sense of humor to make it more interesting. Also, I think people can relate to some of the characters."
2,Quick and cheap is not always better.,"I found John Huston's narration to be the most irritating part ofthis adaptation, ruining with words what would have been a great ending to show instead. Too many changes were made from Steinbeck's novels that seemed to milk down some of his most important themes. My favorite character, Lee Chong, the Chinese grocer, never was included in the movie and Richard Dreyfuss would have made a better Doc Ricketts than Nick Nolte. All in all, a convenience store version of what needed a top drawer sensitive Tiffany's effort."
3,Not that good! Just made 3 stars.,"1) Nick Nolte could not act his way out of a paper bag. Debra Winger and the supporting cast were all very good. 2) The set was too artificial. It looked like cardboard cutouts used in an elementary school play. They should have shot it on location somewhere rather than a soundstage (my guess). 3) Making Nolte's character an ex-pitcher who beaned another ballplayer was a downpoint. This movie should have been billed ""loosley based upon John Steinbeck's .........."". Better to wait for it on TV rather than paying $17 and change."
4,The Perfect Stitch,"I watched Simply Quilts when the episode on how to hand quilt came on and featured this book - I borrowed it several times at the library , very helpful - I am a visual learner , I do better when someone shows me how to do something. This book is a great resource!"
5,Top Notch Book!,"First saw this book quite a few years ago when I was working in a quilt shop, and realized it was a very comprehensive guide to learning to hand quilt. I had already done some hand quilting, but learned a lot about the technique from this book. I had never owned a copy of the book, so recently when some of my sisters were trying to help my Mom with hand quilting a quilt, I decided to find and purchase a copy on Amazon, so that my family could have access to good instruction. The illustrations are very good, and very helpful."
5,Wow!,"I am a beginning quilter and can heartily recommend this book to those in the same boat. It is concise, well-written, and informative beyond belief. Even if I weren't a quilter, I think I'd find myself wrapped up in this book! If you're a hand quilter, save your pennies up and buy this book!"
4,Great Buffer But...,"This is a great buffer but I did notice a couple of minor limitations. I wish the cord didn't angle down at the back of the handle. My first use was on a 30 foot sailboat and I had just put a second coat of ablative bottom paint on. The cord managed to screw up some of the fresh paint, which is my fault, but if the cord had gone straight out the back it wouldn't have happened. Someone else commented that to do true professional work you need a buffer that spins faster. Based on my experience I would have to agree.That said it made short work of a dull, oxidized hull, and put a mirror like finish on the hull. I used lambs wool pads for the polishing compound and wax. The next job will be my Lincoln Town Car and I have foam pads for this job. I expect the same results.The 4 star rating is the result of the limitations, if it weren't for these I would have rated it 5 stars."
5,Great buffer. Excellent speed control.,I have used this buffer for several years since purchase with no issues. Good quality. Precision speed control. Worth every penny.
4,Good Quality but Too Slow,I have had this buffer for 5 years and I use it on my cars and boat. It is well built and heavy due to the robust parts. Since I don't polish cars all the time I like the slower RPMs on the cars because there is less risk of burning the paint. But it just doest turn fast enough to truly polish the gel coat on a boat.I recommend getting the 5540 (2800 RPM) model and just using the dial speed control to reduce RPMs on more delicate finishes.
2,"Fairly Good, But Includes Factual Errors","I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have discovered factual errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric section: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. No, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word ""subacute"" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct."
4,Above Average NCLEX Study Guide,"I bought this book for the CD . . .Strengths- short quiz or full exam mode- over 50 detailed sections- an electronic log of past quiz scores- shuffling of quiz questions so you are always taking a ""new"" quizWeaknesess- No option to print out individual questions- pretty simple explanations for why answers are correct or wrong- necessary to retake quizzes to find correct answersOverall, the best NCLEX books you can buy are from Mary Ann Hogan -Prentice Hall's Reviews & Rationales: Comprehensive NCLEX-RN(R) Review (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series). However, it would cost over $100 to get all the separate books that this covers"
3,"just not too impressed, theres better out there","I was given this book by a friend who had finished nursing school yrs before I started. This book has good information but was blah and wordy @ much of the time. I like to know the important stuff so it stays with me and be on my merry sweet little way and this is not the book for those like me. I used the Lippincott Rn review while in school (good book) but lost it in Hurricane Katrina so for the NCLEX I bought the NSNA RN review book and Frye's 3000 nursing bullets and passed the 1st time with confidenece. I took the exam on January 23rd 2006 and started studying Dec 29th 2005 and get this --finished nursing school in May 2005.I stand behind those books and think they are great choices to consider, but more importantly always feel comfortable with your NCLEX review book or switch it."
3,NEW BOOK,I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT IT ARIVED PROMPTLY AND THATI GAVE AWAY AS A GIFT THE PERSON PASSED THE STATE BOARDS AFTER TAKING THE EXAMINATION ONCE
3,Wasn't the best preparation for the exam,"While it certainly got my mind working, this book was of little help with the nursing exam. The exam I took focused much less on disease states and medications and much more on vague diagnostic questions. On the whole, it's not a bad book but be sure to speak with someone who has recently taken the test prior to using this or any other book for preparation. It'll give you a dose of reality and allow you to focus on questions that will actually be asked."
3,Not the greatest,"I bought this book because it's recommended by my SON to review for the NCLEX. What I don't like about it is the answer section where it tells you why an answer is incorrect. The editors are inconsistent with their rationales and many times their reasoning is pretty vague. For example, one answer tells you Play-Doh is an appropriate toy for a toddler and then 10 questions later it is dangerous because a toddler might eat it. There is a great deal of review questions and the CD is helpful as are the review sections."
3,Heaviest book I didn't read.,This book is crammed full of very specific content on most everything. I didn't use it to study very much because it is overwhelming to think you must memorize or refresh yourself on all of that content. Other books offer more condensed reviews that allowed me to target content so I could use my own textbooks and notes to review specific details. The CD-ROM was useful to familiarize myself with taking a computerized nursing exam.
4,All in all a good book,"This book starts you off with a brief overview of the individual areas of nursing such as Med/Surg, Pediatrics, Psychology... for each section it has questions followed by a section of answers with rationales for the correct/incorrect answer. Once you have covered the material from the individual units the book has two comprehensive tests where you can put your knowledge to the test. This book includes a CD-Rom. The CD-Rom offers you the choice of a practice test and a tutorial. Both give you rationales for the correct/incorrect answers. All in all a good book. The only thing I would add would be questions about delegation."
5,Mr. Rogers at the Circus,Love Mr. Rogers!! The Speedy Delivery truck that came with this DVD is one of my son's favorite toys.
5,Such a wonderful show. Such a wonderful DVD.,"Now you can bring a little bit of Mister Rogers Neighborhood home with you into your very own neighborhood.My niece turns four this month and I look forward to giving her this and the Mister Rogers- 'Adventures in Friendship' DVD. I know she is going to love it as much as I remember loving this show. Her mother and I would watch it everyday. I have such great memories associated with this show. What a pleasure it will be to create some new ones with my new niece!Filled to the brim with positive reinforcement and educational material taught at a slow pace so children can absorb it, Mister Rogers, remains after 30 years on PBS one of the best possible educational shows on television. Mister Rogers makes every child feel special and loved while helping them learn the moral lessons that are missing in so much current children's programming."
5,Great,Kid love Mr. Rogers just as I did. Wish there were more of these. Special features are nice as well.
3,Difficult to see cut line,"I agree with r drolet. I purchased the Milwaukee based on the top rating, but after using it one time, was very disappointed that you can't see the blade and cut line very well. I don't see how the reviewer could have missed that. I guess I'll go back to the Bosch barrel grip, even though the quick blade change feature of the Milwaukee is tops."
5,the skil is in the trashcan...,"Wondering if there is really that big a difference in the higher priced models? YES! I had to cut curves in some very wet, green treated 2X12's for a mother's day project. Had 2 of 4 boards cut after nearly 60 min. of very hard work and much smoke from my ... Skil, which finally seized. Same results with my brothers Craftsman. Bought the milwaukie, and cut the remaining 2 boards in less then 5 minutes! If you get a low end jigsaw as a gift (like I did), smile, say thank you, and use it as a down payment for this saw."
2,Repair problem after 15 months,"I bought this item... March 29th 2001. I used it for cutting 3/4"" MDF. My last project was cutting 3/8"" threaded rod, which was pretty soft. The unit was only used on weekends, never overloaded (it made light work of everything it did cut) and worked well for the most part. Without much explanation, the switch module packed up inbetween cuts of the threaded rod (i.e. it was not in use when it gave out, rather coming up to speed and suddenly it stopped working). Got the usual run around at the repair shop - called Milwaukee and they agreed to cover cost of parts... if I payed the labor... which I agreed to do as I have been without the unit for 30 days now. I would not recommend this unit again - the motor it great, lots of power but you have to wonder why pay the extra dollars if components like the switch are going to give out with moderate use."
4,Smooth Operator,"I've had occasion to use jigsaws from different manufacturers and so far this one from Milwaukee stands out above the others. The low vibration is an important feature(I have carpal tunnel problems in my wrists)and the ease of changing blades means less downtime in the midst of a large job. I'd like the tool more if I could use universal blades as well, and a toolless shoe adjustment would be a desirable feature. This is a strong, well-built tool that should stand up to hard use."
2,Can't See The Line,"Purchased approximately 6 months ago and have had opportunity to use on several occasions. Smooth running tool and orbital feature nice, but... too difficult to see the blade while cutting. Base plate lacks a feature to slide back so that you can see and follow a cut-line."
2,You can't win...,There are 2 models made by different companys but look the same. This model the 600 series doesn't allow you the flexiblity to program it even from Direct TV. The 100 series works better but it's already been phased out. The newer HD reciever from Direct TV doesn't have an off air antanna connection. You can't win.
1,HDMI Port stopped working....,"I got a new Directv service with H20 receiver. Just after completing 3 months warranty period, HDMI port stopped working. There was no VIDEO/AUDIO through HDMI port. Called Directv support and they said it's a known issue and they would replace it with a refurbished one. But the twist was I had to extend my contract for another two years to get the faulty receiver replaced. Which sounded ridiculous. I decided to use Component Cables for viewing 1080i instead of HDMI. I regret for switching from Comcast to Directv.I don't want to get stuck with Directv due to faulty receivers. Eventually I may have to pay early termination fee if my Component port also stops working."
1,Wish I had read the reviews first,"Mine is basically the same story as the others. After shelling out $300 to DirecTV for the HD DVR, they didn't install the second line so the DVR function never worked properly. Then suddenly my HD signals died. First guy said the signal was bad and the dish needed to be recalibrated. Another appointment for recalibration and the guy said ""signal is fine, what you need is a new BBC converter"". New BBC converter shows up and still no HD. In frustration I cancelled, and am now slapped in the face with the $250 cancellation fee.If you go with DirecTV, I recommend lots of lube."
5,Out of print? Say it ain't so!,"What a shame this book is out of print. I received my Black and Decker breadmaker as an engagement present and my Dad also included this book and I have faithfully used these recipes ever since. My favourite recipes are the Yummy Yogurt Dill Loaf and the Rich White Dinner Rolls. I make those every time we have guests over for dinner and the first thing to disappear on the table is the bread. These ladies know their stuff when it comes to making the most delicious homemade breads I have ever eaten. After all these years I still have more recipes to explore, thanks for the baking adventures ladies! You make my house feel more like a home with your fantastic recipes."
4,lots to think about,"I finished this book several days ago and find myself still thinking about it. I highly recommend it to teens and adults who want something they can mull over for a while, as well as those who simply want a good read.My conclusions? I found it interesting that Thomas treats Patrick's disillusionment almost as a natural progression rather than a series of choices. Patrick doesn't seem to debate much about whether to do the things he does; he simply does them. Maybe living in Hollywood is like that for everyone--I've never been there--but I can't shake the feeling that this book tells us more about the author than it does the main character (no offense, Mr. Thomas). That's MHO; y'all read it and see if you agree."
5,"""Never Underestimate LYTE thee MC, I Am a Rapper Who is Here to Make Things The Way They're Meant To BE"" PRICELESS","Lyte in my opinion is truly the ultimate female emcee in history. Lyte Years highlights the emcee at her earlier years from public service announcement videos, source of motivation, classic videos like ""Lyte As a Rock, Paper Thin, I'm Not Havin It, Eyes are the Soul, Cha Cha Cha"" to the making of the aforementioned videos, as well as extracts of certain unreleased material like Sinbad's I Aint Lyin & A Dr. Soul performance. She truly has come a long way as a respectable hiphop femcee. Much love and respect to hiphop and its pioneers. I LOVE YALL."
2,Do not purchase as companion for the book..,"I was greatly disappointed in this movie. It was so loosely based on the book that you could barley see the story. I was hoping for a companion DVD to the book for my children's Sunday school class. The DVD stayed away from the true message of the book and had talking animals and other characters that took away from the message in the book. When Lucy asked why the stripes were red she was told because somethings are special and it was a symbol.. A symbol of what.. is not said. I do not recommend the DVD if you want this to go along with the book. The children watched it an said it was ok, but they all agreed the book was much much better."
4,Candy Cane Legend,Delightful story about the origin of the candy cane especially set-up for children; our granddaughters loved it but it did not really appeal to the adults.
1,The Legend of the Candy Cane,I would recommend renting this DVD before buying it. I was totally disappointed with it. This could have been a good christmas story to be watched for generations to come but the produces gave only a brief mention of the candy cane symbolism. It didn't follow the story book at all. Instead they chose to dwell on relationships and talking animals. This is not a video I would be proud to call Christian. Once again it makes Christians out to be unintelligent.
1,disapointed,"I needed this movie to better reflect the book...it condensed the 'candy cane' part of the story and drug out the extra story lines.... As I was using it to open a dialogue about the true meaning of Christmas, this was very disapointing. I finally turned it off, and just told the story."
4,Pretty good drill,"I burned out Dad's old hammer drill, and I neededone to finish my job and get him a replacement.Unfortunately, Dad has not yet got ahold of this one.In hindsight, I wish I had gotten the keyless chuckversion, but this is a rugged piece of equipment.It has enough power to easily rip the drill fromyour hand if the bit happens to grab ahold of something.And dual variable speed is a nice touch.What I dont like about it is that the collar toswitch from hammer to regular drill is easilybumped and switched inadvertently.Also, the power cable must be detached from thedrill before it will fit into its carrying case.Attaching and removing the cord is relatively easy,except in dark corners, but I wish the casewere just a bit bigger so that I wouldnt have toattach and detach the cord everytime I get thedrill out and put it away."
5,Tremendous,An admirably thorough guide to the tools of the production-line meat processing trade. The superb colour photographs particularly made it a perfect gift for my 15 year old daughter who is showing alarming signs of not becoming vegetarian.
1,Regret installing Mcafee,"I uninstalled Norton and installed Mcafee Security Centre as I read many reviews in various PC magazines giving the product a good review. I wish I had stayed with Norton. Mcafee is extremely slow and freezes my MS Outlook everytime Outlook performs a send/receive which in my case is every 2 minutes. I send receive about 1000 emails a month, and frankly Mcafee is slowing my business down by freezing Outlook every 2 minutes. I am going to uninstall and go back to Norton."
4,2006 VirusScan/Firewall Bundle,"Seems to work fairly quietly (good), but tends to slow the startup process. Having used McAfee products in the past, I expect to be fairly satisfied with its performance at keeping viruses off of my computer."
3,Disappointed Subscriber,"I've been a McAfee subcriber for about 5 years. I switched from Norton because I felt it was too complicated and had too much control over my computer. I found McAfee to be user friendly. I can't say that I'm pleased with the 2006 version. The platform is a complete change. In the previous versions, I kept log of the Internet in/out bound access and the system processes. The new version only has the SystemGuard event log which is useless to me. My computer freezes often now. Because of the limited event log, I can't determine where the problem is. The previous version would have shown the details. I'm considering not renewing my subcription another year. Customer service could use some improvement. Though the few times I've needed their assistance, the representatives have been helpful."
3,What's the fuss about?,"My Mcafee seems to work perfectly fine. Never any problems updating or connecting to or downloading from !! Bad Sites !!, They're very responsive the few times I've downloaded a trojan or such, and promptly delete said nefarious program. Yeah, the customer service sucks!!!!! One time on a default viruscan I came up with no fewer than 10 ( suppposedly infected files ) viruses. The problem was due to an incompetent DAT update which misread certain files and lined them up for deletion. That was maybe 10 months ago. Alas, I never did get a reply. maybe auto telephone and fake e-mail correspondents are par for the course in Mcafeeland. But for a premier service I think it's kinda wonky."
2,Lost potential,"""Live My Life, ""Please Believe It,"" and ""What Side Are You On"" are the highlights of this album which seemed to lack solid production. All of Jerzey Mob and the Outlawz display flashes of brilliance and raw talent, but a couple songs seem to fade out and the last track was cut short. Outlaw Recordz should have held back on this release. If you're an Outlawz fan, you're gonna want to hear what they and the Jerzey Mob have to say, but there are other Outlaw Recordz albums better than this one. Hopefully the next Jerzey Mob album will be more polished."
4,...some singers lose it as they get older...,"...but all you have to do is watch Darren as Vic Fontaine on ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" to know that he hasn't. Bobby Darin may have been the Baby Boomer's Sinatra, but James Darren was our Tony Bennett. Which makes this album one album too few. Any of you guys at Trek buy stuff at Amazon? Listen up--you ought to co-produce with Darren a ""Vic Fontaine Album""--full-length versions of the stuff he sings in the holodeck, plus a few more that maybe ""didn't make it onto an episode""."
3,"Get ""This One's From The Heart""","If you're looking for a collection of the type of songs James Darren sang on the ""Deep Space Nine"" TV show, get his newest CD, ""This One's From The Heart"". He really does sing better than Sinatra and those other guys and the songs on the ""...From The Heart"" CD are the proof. Hopefully he will be recording more of the great standards in the near future."
3,This is NOT Vic Fontaine.,"When James Darren assumed the role of the singing hologram Vic Fontaine in Star Trek DS9, he unwittingly struck a massive chord with fans like myself who bought his albums of a similar style namely ""This Ones from the Heart"" and ""Because of You"". I am just waiting for James to bring out some more of a similar sort.The album ""The Best of James Darren"" although good, is something entirely different, perhaps, with the exception of track 1 Gidget. Great if you like late fifties and early sixties music of a more popular style, but not if you want more Vic Fontaine. Its an interesting album though and Im sure a lot of people will enjoy this retrospective view of JD's singing career. But as for me, I think as a singer James Darren's voice has got better with time. In my opinion and others Ive talked to, he is more than capable of outpeforming Frank Sinatra. Expect to see great things from James Darren he is definitely one to watch!"
2,Can this be Vic Fontaine from DS9?,"James Darren has come back to life after 30 years as the DS-9 holodeck night club performer Vic Fontaine. In the series, Vic sings classic standards in his holodeck program with a terrific voice that would put Sinatra to shame. He is in my opinion, now one of the most interesting characters on the show. Unfortunately, this album is James as a teenager in the 50's-60's and, other than for nostalgia, it's fairly awful."
3,More lows than highs,"The singer is better than his material here in this 1958-1976 collection which features an awful lot of that post-Buddy Holly, pre-Beatles pseudo-rock-and-roll. ""Gidget"" is cute, but the biggest hits border on novelty, including ""Goodbye Cruel World"" and ""Her Royal Majesty"". ""Put On a Happy Face"" is a group effort with Darren, Paul Peterson, and Shelley Fabares that almost hurts to listen to. ""All"", though, is a pleasant upbeat take on a lovely melody from the 1966 film ""Run For Your Wife"" that marked Darren's last foray into the top 40. The final track is a disco number from the ""Rocky"" soundtrack that, whicle not bad in itself, is somewhat of a non-sequitor in this company. Excellent liner notes that place each track in context."
1,Display does not work,"When I first received this scale, the display did not work. Even after replacing the original battery, it did not work consistently. There must be a problem with the battery contact. It is not usable without the display. I have been travelling for some time and the 30-day return period has expired. Am at a loss as to what to do."
5,Mind Opener,"Excellent book for Multimedia/New Media designers, students and academics.It is a must for `embedded designer`."
4,This book does a good job spicening rp in the Dark Ages.,"I must admit a book like this has been needed long ago. I myself prefer to play Vampire, the Dark Ages over Vampire, the Masquerade. The book shows Jerusalem as the center of faith in the dark ages, which is somewhat true since to all of the three main religons in the world, Jerusalem is a city of holy importance. How can a vampire survive with all this faith around? How much of the vampire's faith is twisted for the character to survive? The book gives a decent picture of the past situation of the religons involved with some twists. Highly recommended."
4,"Good CD, could be better! 4 stars","For a trance fan this cd is great, it could do without some of the cheesy songs, but all-in-all, the good songs on it make up for it!"
5,Feel like Bonham,"These are by far the smoothest double kicks I have ever used, the new dual chain design gives you added stability and control. The response time is amazing and you can adjust them to any playing type. Great for endurance double kicking. What else can you expect from DW than quality?"
4,It's good till it breaks,"I've had this 7000 double for about three years and it's broken a few times. The springs broke, a screw also broke and yesterday, the right pedal joint (full metal joint by the heel) broke like if it was plastic. I do play hard and I play in a band. We practice 2-3 times a week and try to have shows every weekend. I do love the pedals but it broke a few times and now it is unfixable :( If you play hard, I suggest going with the next one up which I now will get the 9000. I'm sure it's smoother and faster but probably made out of the same materials, so I don't know.... we'll see I guess."
2,Keep shopping,I have had DW7000 kick pedals for about 4 years now. They held up for about a year and started falling apart. They are fine if you play once in a while and aren't too hard on them. I am in a band that plays live shows at least once a month and I have had at least two incidents where we had to stop in the middle of a song (while performing) because the pedal would come loose or some other issue. My pedals are almost unplayable now because the heel of the right pedal has a screw that broke and is stuck inside making it a loose platform. Save your money for another paycheck and get the next one up.
5,Wow! Solo el puede hacerlo!!!,Por algo Marc Anthony es el salsero mas famoso e importante del universo. Solo el puede actuar asi. Sientese a ver este DVD y vera porque lo digo. Ni se moleste en buscarle defectos a esta presentacion porque no los tiene.
5,RE-MARC-ABLE!,"I was at the live concert at Madison Square Garden, NYC and felt like I was given an encore presentation again at home!"
5,great concert !,this is a rememorable concert .. love marc anthony love the music .. thanks for the super fast delivery !
3,"Is the ""Special"" Edition really ""Special""?","This movie has its charms; however I'm a bit skeptical that they're calling this a ""special"" edition: Where are the extra features, making of, commentary, etc.? And where's the original wide-screen version of the film? Why just the full-screen version? They've done this with the DVDs to other animated films ('Cats Don't Dance', 'Balto', just to name a couple. These, as well as Swan Princess, deserve the wide-screen formats.) So--4 stars for the film, but minus one star for perhaps-not-being-such-a-special-edition-after-all. (I guess that's what you'd call it!)"
5,servants,"In one scene Prince Derek says ""The servants have the day off"" Why would they give all the servants the same day off. Especially when Queen Uberta was having a tea party. Who made the tea? who served the tea? I hardly doubt that Queen Uberta would stoop to making and serving the tea herself, especially if they are at her social standing, like other kings and queens, or prince and princess. It was not established who they were, I am just assuming thay were kings and queens. Who they were is beside the point. I doubt any kingdom, a royal castle or royal palace, or whatever would give all the servants the same day off."
4,swan princess DVD,I was thrilled to see you had all of the swan princess dvd's I wanted to give to my granddaughter at such a great princess and she is going to love all of them. Thank you for having all of them she wanted and such good service getting them to me. Sue Munoz
1,Terrible!,"I guess ""terrible"" could be too rash. If you like really bad song lyrics and the most annoying melodies imaginable, this is right up your alley. The second movie is definately worst than the first. Prince Erik's mother, whose voice is done by Christy Landers, is the most grating voice I can remember hearing. The whining she does about ""my birthday, my birthday!"" (obviously the fault of the writers) is enough to make me throw up! Or at the least throw the movie away. But alas, I have a 3 year old who loves it."
4,Magical,"It's not my favorite animated movie, but it's still really good! I remember watching this movie when I was younger. And now, at almost 21, it's still just a magical for me. My young nieces love it too!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"The swan princess is awesome!!! I have seen these movies so many times and i still love them! The songs are great and Jean-Bob is sooo funny. Also, the great animal is really cool. These are the best movies ever!!!!!!!!!"
4,good kids movie,its kinda like all other disney movies..where they fall in love but then have a bunch of trials to overcome.. its an okay kids movie the dragon thing at the end is a bit scary for little kids bit overall a good movie.
4,Swan Princess,"I love this movie! The music is good, the characters are good, and the love story is great! My favorite part though is Jack Palance as the bad guy."
5,Great fun for the whole family,"We enjoyed this movie with our kids when it first came out. We bought this copy for our 4 yr old grandson, and he loves it too. Fun characters, great music, good moral, and just enough action to keep the guys interested."
5,Can't find it anymore.,"I live in a small town, so when I wanted to own this movie once again as a reminder of my wonderful childhood, I was just a little bit out of luck. I couldn't find it anywhere. So when I found it on the internet for such a low price, I couldn't pass it up.This is such a wonderfully cute and light-hearted story that I love to watch it even to this day."
3,Swan Princess,"The DVD is in pretty good condition. It has a few scratches on it and won't play on certain computers, but overall it was a great purchase. I love this movie. Thanks!"
5,Jazz for The Neo Soul Fan,"I've been searching for jazz with hip hop influence for a while and I stumbled upon Yesterday's New Quintet. The first listen didn't grab me, but by the third I realized this musiq was genius. The sound is unique - it's soothing yet bumpin'. If you are a hip-hop/r&b fan looking to try some jazz this is the CD fo' ya."
4,...half amusing/half amazing...,"...imagine shock g, dj premier and ali shaheed muhammad gettin together to do a jazz album and this might pretty much be what they come up with!i still prefer my jazz organic/original...but ever since i got hooked on dj cam's 'mad blunted jazz', then this is the kinda stuff i been lookin for...i've been burned with some of my purchases lately, but this one omost pleases me and that has been somethin extremely rare lately! this aint nothin laid back, kinda like some new age thelonious monk or mingus...this has that free jazz feel, i think folks here are callin it abstract, but whatever it is it's nice...caution tho: if you aint got the ear for the ""not-usual"", then you may be better off with somethin else...but if you like any craig taborn or clifford gilberto or even some art blakey, then you might can get with this...jump on in, the water's fine..."
5,New Classic for Generations,"Minus the long tedious comments, the book is excellently crafted and depicts well orchestrated battles and harmony of character development and story-pacing narration. Definitely will be pasted down to my next generation descendants. slightly mature (for the teenage audience)though. R.A. Salvatore has sold me on the Genre if not all his works."
2,Junk Fantasy,"This really isn't too great. I had read Salvatore's Vector Prime from Star Wars NJO and really liked it. I thought I might try some of his fantasy. Some is better than others. This one though is nothing more than a quick set of reads. The stories are rather shallow, and to me anyway, the characters seemed mostly unremarkable and stereotypical.On the other hand, the books aren't hideous. I think they get better as they go along. It is a decent way to burn all the hours in a day."
1,Horrible...,"These books were so stupid. I don't know what the fuss has always been about. The world is one-dimensional, unbelievable and paper-dollish; the dwarf is so cliched as to be laughable; Cattie Brie is by far the dumbest name and most annoying character in the annals of fantasy; the barbarian is (again) cliched and ridiculous; the halfling (as usual since Tolkien) is absurd and annoying; the battle scenes are boring, unrealistic and go on forever; the villain is like something out of a bad Saturday morning cartoon. Just pathetic. I started reading the Dark Elf trilogy, dying to know why everyone thinks Salvatore is so great. I couldn't even finish the first book. Just horrid..."
2,What's the big deal??,"I have tried and tried to read this book (amongst all of the other dumb Forgotten Realms), it has not worked. The books are boring, and everything seems so redundant. I hated them. They are just like all of the other stupid Terry Goodkind and LOTR stuff......boring fantasy. I DON""T recommend it, period."
2,Not made in USA,I thought that buying Milwaukee implied an American made tool. The Auger bits are made in Taiwan.
5,Ronnie Dove Collectors Album,"I love this album. I had forgotten how enjoyable those golden oldies were, and what a great voice Ronnie has. The songs bring back so many wonderful memories."
4,Elaboration and elucidation,"One of the allegations in this case is that the FBI not only concealed Limone et al innocence, but tried to coerce the parole board not to let them grant parole for Limone, Greco, Cassesso Tameleo. This has erupted into a bitter feud even involving two mayoral administrations in Massachusetts, the Caron and Albano administrations.A prominent family is mentioned and this has involved a controversial judge, Judge Lopez, whose husband owns a controversial newspaper which allows escort services and the like open advertising. The Justice Dept was involved in this case as it is the Bulger case."
4,Very interesting good read,"I know someone who has been targeted for financial and employment destruction ever since this case started coming unglued in 1995. MBNA began coming down on them and other creditors followed suit after the blacklisting by MBNA. The man was a safety and environmental professional for the Grace Corp and former Woburn resident and child of state care after having been abandoned by his family.Since Bulger fled in 1995 this person has progressively been hurt in nearly every way.As an aside, Judge Tauro in this case involving Bulger's FBI handler was also involved in the Chappaquidick case involving Ted Kennedy also."
4,OK for Welsh Corgi Pembroke,This works well for carrying our Corgi in the back seat of a Corolla. Keeps the dog hair off the seats and our Corgi seems to find the enclosure comforting - she's never been too happy riding in the car and would spend most of the time on the floor in front of the back seats. Our only misgiving about the crate is that it would be nice if it would fold down easier - then we'd just pop it into the trunk when we don't need it. Its proved easier to just carry it into the house (it's nice and light) and leave it set up.
5,Excellent Quality,"We bought the largest crate for our 90 lb. dog. Very light weight, easy to carry and put up, and fit into our Ford 500 trunk."
1,Easy to Chew Through,"This kennel is great for a dog show or something where you will be RIGHT THERE by your pet the whole time. We've had our dog in this kennel supervised for years with no problem. One day, I left her in the kennel while we went out for a short errand and she chewed through the whole door. The fabric is only mesh and there is no way to fix it. Huge bummer especially for the price paid! I would not recommend this crate."
1,"Nice, unless your dog wants out.","Get this crate if your dog has no interest in leaving the crate. It takes minutes for almost any dog to chew or tear their way out. Our dog was fine with the crate until the one day that she wasn't. It's not repairable, so it's in the trash."
4,Great for Travel Folding Crate,"I bought this to take my 10 week old lab puppy (who will be getting much bigger)in the car/ hotel/ traveling. It sets up really fast, it's light weight and super portable. If your dog is a little rowdy, they will be able to tip it over...other than that, I am pleased..I just hope he doesn't grow out of it."
4,great window space,Great amount of window space for the dog to look out and for us to keep an eye on her. Most of the other tents we looked at don't give the dog an enough air flow while this one is almost all windows. We use this with the air conditioning on in hotels while traveling being careful there's no way she can over heat. The tent feels very sturdy but make sure your dog is crate trained in a normal crate before trying something like this out.
4,Pet Crate,"The first reviewer was rating this item poorly only due to the fact that it was smaller than they thought it would be. The sizes are clearly stated in the description, and this looks like a good item, and should be judged accordingly. I don't feel a review should be submitted with a low rating just because the reviewer did not read the item description clearly! This is a good price if you need a very small pet crate."
3,Zipper Problem,"In comparing the Midwest Canine Camper Day Tripper crate to the NOZTONOZ -- paws down, my vote is for NOZTONOZ.The Midwest brand is less expensive but the quality is lacking in my opinion. It relies on a fabric covered piece of plywood that sets on the floor of the unit providing structure. The zipper got stuck several times which was the deal breaker for us. If the zipper had worked better, the design isn't all that bad. The size 31x22x24 was ideal for our 9 pound Yorkie. I just prefer the NOZTONOZ brand over the Midwest brand that we tried."
3,Good Crate but Not For Puppies...,"We purchased this crate for travel with our Labradoodle puppy. The crate is very easy to set up. Seemed comfortable enough. Unfortunately, it is not meant for a puppy. Our little guy chewed through the covering on the base of the crate (which was just a piece of hard plywood with a zippered lambskin cover), chewed the plywood base and chewed through the mesh on the side of the crate. He didn't do it all in one sitting but this crate only lasted us a few months. I would only recommend this crate for folks with more mature dogs."
3,NOT THE STRONGEST CRATE,FAIRLY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER BUT HAS AN ODOR SO LEAVE IT OUT FOR A WHILE BEFORE PUTTING THE DOG IN IT. NOT TOO STRONG BUT EASY TO KEEP IN THE BACK OF AN SUV. GOOD FOR TEMPORARY USE LIKE WHEN YOU VISIT SOMEONE.
3,Just OK,I bought two of these crates. Both of my dogs tore through the screen on the front. These aren't cheap to replace so I'm pretty disappointed.
2,Not secure enough...,"I bought a small apartment in the city for the weekends and needed a temporary kennle for my brittany spaniel. I didn't have much hope of that type of kennel keeping my dog secure (Brittany's are smart and escape artists!) but thought I'd give it a try. The kennel appeared well made and as advertised took only a few minutes to set up. The first time I put him in I pulled the zippers down equally leaving them at the bottom of the zippered door. When I came back I was greeted by my dog at the door. He must have pushed on the webbing of the door hard enough to seperate the zippers and then pushed his way through. The next time out, I clipped the two zippers together so they could not seperate. When he greeted me at the door the next time I knew this was not going to work. Basically he either chewed or pawed a hole in the mesh screening and worked on it until the hole wasbig enough to go through... Perhaps the kennel would work for a much more passive breed."
1,Midwest Canine Camper Day Tripper soft sided crate,"It is quite useful while traveling. It opens and gets set up quite easily. I wished I had known something like this existed before this drive from NJ to Fl. My labradoodle is great in the car but once we get into hotel room and she hears a noise she starts barking. The crate is a ""secure"" place for dog."
1,Photo Misrepresentation,The photo of the item when purchased showed a a large dog in the carrier sitting in the seat of the car. This is how I expected the item I purchased to look.I had to rush out and purchase another suitable carrier from Pet Smart.Lesson learned not to trust the photo displayed.
3,Not big enough for my Chihuahua,"I initially bought this product (the smallest size) so that I could have a carrying case for my chihuahua to fly to Florida with me as a cabin carry-on. One of the specifications for bringing an animal in the cabin is that the dog has to have room to fit in the kennel while standing (i.e. long enough for the dog to stand in the kennel). My 1 year old chihuahua did not fit in this case! He could lit in there curled up, but could not stand lengthwise. Perhaps this was my fault for not looking more carefully to the demensions of the product, but the airlines require the total kennel to be under a certain size so I ordered the smallest one possible.Apart from the size issue, the kennel seemed fine. I didnt have much trouble with the zippers as I had read from other reviews, but perhaps it's becuase of the small size of kennel I ordered."
5,Perfect for my little dog.,"This crate was super easy to set up and has many practical features. It's light, easy to move from room to room and isn't as ugly as most plastic crates!One suggestion if you buy this item: Make sure you zip up the flap so that both zippers meet at the top. I made the mistake of zipping at the bottom and Peter was able to work his way through the small gap and escape!"
5,Canine Camper Soft Crate,"The soft crate is wonderful for my 7 year old Golden Retriever. I can see that it would not be ideal as a training crate for a puppy, but that should be pretty obvious as it is a soft crate. Set up is very simple, size is perfect and it is very attractive to have open in our home. Well worth the price."
5,Good value!,"My wife and I were moving from Chicago to Tucson with our two small dogs (pug and a pekingese) and wanted to find something that they would both fit in, that wasn't too large for the rear of the SUV. We took a chance on this crate and I'm glad we did. Not only were the dogs more secure in this crate than when they are allowed full roam of the vehicle, but they were also more calm during the trip; which is saying a lot since our pekingese is a very anxious dog. It helps that they both are crate trained I'm sure, but all in all this was a great crate that still comes in handy when taking small trips with our two little guys."
4,Classy Watch,Very attractive watch. Looks especially good with a gold/stainless two- tone flexible band.Only downside is the date and hour analogs are extremely small and more for cosmetics than anything else--- unless you have a magnifying glass.
5,Prompt delivery and prompt service,"The adapter arrived within a matter of days, but the plug didn't fit my old Toshiba. I emailed the company via the Amazon website, and received a prompt reply back from them.I gave them the specific model number for both the computer and adapter, and they shipped a replacement out that same day, at no extra charge. That replacement arrived very quickly,and now my old computer is chugging happily along again. I was very impressed by the responsiveness of the company - and would order from them again (or recommend them to others)."
2,If you have nothing else to do...,"you might consider watching this very cheesy collection of skits by AbFab star Jennifer Saunders (who is only mildly original and amusing here) and Dawn French (who is just plain annoying). Just for reference's sake, I think AbFab is great, original and wild comedy. French & Saunders just doesn't cut it, no matter how hard I try to like it. I'm glad I just bought this one DVD, I'm not going to bother with the others. If you like british comedy and the likes of Monty Python, Benny Hill, Blackadder and AbFab, chances are you will not like French & Saunders very much if at all."
3,Great movies; mediocre dvds.,"There's no point in getting this set when you can buy the 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba set, which already has all 4 of the movies in this set plus 6 others. The 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba set has slightly better picture and it even has the optional Japanese track for the first movie whereas this set doesn't. Still, all of these budget Street Fighter sets released in the US look blurry like old vhs tapes. If you're a real Chiba fan, I suggest getting a region-free dvd player and the region-2 Street Fighter boxset from Amazon UK. The improved picture and audio is a night-and-day difference. Otherwise, get the 10 Faces of Sonny Chiba set since it's better than this set and costs about the same."
1,Poor! Very Poor!,"It's better than a worn,non-tracking VCR tape but that's not saying much now is it! This set has only one thing in it's favor,it's wide-screen,that's all.My set has that screen digitation going on in several spots(Return is the worst)I also have serious doubts these are unrated versions of these films.I have all these on Tape and I can't tell any difference.All in all not worth the [...] bucks at all unless you were to pay [...] bucks for used VCR tapes!"
5,A must for pulp fiction researchers,"Goulart modestly subtitles this book ""an informal history,"" however it's fairly overarching in its treatment of pulp magazines. It serves as a primer for pulp fiction/magazine/author research. Goulart focuses on authors and genres other than mere cutting and pasting of original pulp writings as some others have done. He also knows how to write, making this an entertaining as well as important book."
1,Heavy duty? More like light duty!,"The saw is o.k for small jobs, but under heavy loads (like cutting two studs apart that are nailed together) the motor binds and the motor begins to reek of electric overload. When you build 50 panelized homes a year and have to do some ""on site engineering"" quite often, this saw fails the test. I sold the saw to a home owner and bought a Porter Cable 11.5 amper... By far a superior saw!!"
5,A great gift for a husband who likes tools,"My husband is a carpenter and I bought this sawzall for him as a gift. I wanted to get him the top of the line Milwaukee Sawzall. I did some research and found Amazon had the best prices for this model. He absoulutely LOVES it! He shows off his new ""toy"" at the job site to everyone. Even our neighbor has asked to borrow it already. I know I picked a winner buying this as a gift!"
2,dont waste your money,"I have always been a fan of Milwaukee products.I own several, so when this sawzall came out I just had to buy it.I dont use them everyday or for heavy construction mostly cutting thru 2x4's I went thru 2 of these in a year. The first one lasted a few months and I used it about 20 times I thought I must just have gotten a bad one.I purchased another and it lasted 5 cutsand burned out.I now own the new 13 amp Bosch and couldn't be more pleased. It vibrates but gets the job done and in the end thats what matters most because in my business time is money."
5,Like a hot knife through butter,I purchased this saw to replace a craftsman professional that I was not too happy with. Let me just tell you the orbital action on this saw makes it cuts through material like its butter. I am overwhelmingly impressed and would reccommend this to anyone who wants to have the best most durable reciprocating saw on the market. Some people have complained about the quick loc clamp for the cord but its not worth giving this saw anything less then 5 stars. Way to go milwaukee
5,The name says it all.,"Sawzall. Nails, studs, fence posts, rails, tree limbs all cut like butter. I recommend this tool for everyone from beginner to professional. The weight is not excessive. The blades are easy to insert and remove. Vibration is nominal. The only draw back is the lack of a saftey to prevent my four year old helper from accidentally starting the saw, but fortunately the quick disconnect power cord compensates."
1,What a P.O.S.,"This is the first time I've been moved to write a review. We have had three of these saws go bad in the past two weeks, and I'm just disgusted. I don't know if it is just the orbital model, or all the new Milwaukee sawzalls, but these things drop like flies on our site. We do remodelling projects with a small crew, and the Sawzalls and Skilsaws get the most use. At least the Skilsaws are still as good as they used to be (though I switched to the Bosch version). I'm thinking I need a Porter Cable or Bosch reciprocating saw to replace my burned out Milwaukee."
5,lots of room and built to last,I didn't buy this bag through Amazon but I have owned the same one for five years and use it about six days per week. It has lots of room and has held up very well. I recommend it highly. It is an excellent value for the price.
3,"A pleasant, light fantasy of wit, romance and greek myths.","Dalkey has written a pleasant fantasy, set in Ancient Rome. Taking a fresh look at the legend of Medusa, the author avoids most cliches and deftly weaves magic and romance into Roman politics."
5,Great two cd set...,"I always liked Shep & The Limelights/Heartbeats, and after listening to this two cd set, I love them even more.The standards of ""Daddy's Home & the followup of ""A Thousand Miles away"" is always nice. But a cut I never heard of before, ""Why, why won't you believe me?"" brought tears to me eyes. It is so vulnerable and aching. Too much man.There are alot of great harmony cuts in here, but I could do without the faster tempo pieces. It's the slower tempo songs you want like ""Crazy for you"" ""People are talking"" and ""One week from Today"". Great heartfelt tunes.This is a good one to get.Joe"
3,Still Looking For a Jigsaw,"I like Milwaulkee quality, but both jigsaws have a seperate speed control on the end. It is difficult to turn on and off and it's also impossible to change the speed while cutting. Sometimes you need to start out with a slow speed and increase the speed after you are into your cut. I returned mine for a jigsaw with the on/off and speed control in the switch. It's also rather large and heavy."
1,Audiovox Portable DVD Package,"I returned this item unused. Didn't like how the DVD player hung forwad from backseats. I have two small children, and they surely would have kicked it to its death. So I didn't even attempt it. Want something that folds back and does not have anything at the kids feet for a kicking bag."
4,Portable DVD Package Useful During Long Trips,"This DVD package system was a Christmas present for my daughter's family for use in the rear of their mini-van on long trips. She reported it worked well with no problems, and was especially happy that I provided a separate cable that allowed them to plug the audio in the car stero, although the unit does have its own speakers."
1,JUNK DO NOT BUY AUDIOVOX,"My daughter received this for christmas and it was used approx 3-4 times, the 2nd screen just stopped working, I contact amazon and they of course can't help me cause its passed 90 days, so i contacted Audioxov and i would have to pay for repairs.."
4,We love it!,We got this for our van and we are loving it! The kids can watch the same movie or two separate movies. Each player has its own color coded remote. I would like to get the adapter to hook it up to the van stereo because it is too quiet for my son with hearing problems.
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I used this item a total of two times. The first to charge the battery and the second time after the 90 day warranty expired. The unit does not power up when plugged into an outlet. It did the first time that I used it but not the second time. When I called Audiovox they gave me a choice of sending the unit in and paying $90 just to look at it, or buying a new outlet adaptor for the unit, and if the adaptor wasn't the problem they would accept a return and bang me for a 25% restocking fee. I will never buy another Audiovox product again. They do not stand behind their products."
1,Great Concept - Bad Execution,"The concept of a second screen is great, and we were excited to use it.Unfortunately for us, the second screen stopped working within the first couple of minutes of use.More generally, however, we were immediately disappointed to see that the units do not have batteries and must be connected to an external power source. That is fine on a car trip, but for plane trips, it can't be used."
4,30 years in the making...,"The Songwaves Project is the brainchild of Mike Garrigan and Tommy Nikosey who's vocals and harmonies blend together in unison to create some very exciting music. There is a complex chain of events that led to the re-formation of this band of the early 70's. Mike Garrigan met guitarist Dave Amato (Cher, Ted Mugent, Richie Sambora and for the last 10 years REO Speedwagon) and drummer Ron Wikso during Cher's 1990 ""Heart of Stone"" tour. They jammed together during sound checks and discovered they had something ""majic""al. The Soundwaves Project is kind of a ""supergroup"" melting pot. With several guest musicians lending their talents to make this recording something special. Neal Doughty and Bruce Hall (REO Speedwagon), Mick Taylor, Bret Tuggle. Cher sings with Mike on a Rolling Stones cover of ""Tell Me (Your Coming Back)"". If you like great harmonies, great lyrics and great music in general you will love Majic Ship. Pick up your copy today!"
3,Spainonline,Excellent price. Delivery as expected. This Fragance has been changed so smells diferent than the first one.
5,Mark Murphy in his prime!,"Mark Murphy is one of the best male jazz vocalists around today, he's as hip now as he was 40 years ago. On this fine session, Murphy is constantly stretching himself, improvising and scatting, in his wonderfully eclectic way. There's plenty of chancetaking by Murphy, and his backup band also gets a chance to stretch out. Highlights are a Duke Ellington medley, and a wonderful In The Land Of Oo-Bla-Dee. the wonderful thing about this cd, and all Murphy releases is(like Anita O'Day) listeing to him is like watching a tightrope walker, walking across, wondering if he'll fall off, but he never does. Murphy is a true risk taker, and a true original, his voice is as warm as ever, this is Mark Murphy in his prime! This 2001 release is recommended."
3,Not Enough of Karla Faye Tucker in this DVD,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD. It is less than 31 minutes and focuses more on the brother (Ron Thornton) of the slain woman than it does on Karla Faye. You only see snippets of Karla Fay throughout the short film, but they reveal her mind and heart. It is the brother and his difficulty in forgiving Karla Faye that is the focus of this film. However, if you are already convinced of the genuine transformation of this woman, seeing her voice the hope that her execution will give peace to those filled with hatred of her will reinforce your conviction of her purity of heart. The film does make an eloquent statement though of the power of forgiveness to restore peace to and uplift one's soul. Ron Thornton is proof of that."
5,SO GREAT A LOVE EVERYONE NEEDS TO WATCH,"This is an example of Almighty God's love for all of us, if we simply come to Him, as did Karla with her horrible past and asking for foregiveness and surrendering her life to him, we can also know that same foregiveness and love by surrendering our hearts to our ALMIGHTY LOVING HEAVENLY FATHER and He WILL FOREGIVE and make us clean too. Sin is sin!!This is the ultimate love of God, not that we loved Him, but that He loved us and sent His only son to the cross for one reason, to take our filthy sins upon himself and died for us, HE PAID IT ALL SO WE CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WITH HIM IF WE ACCEPT HIS SACRIFICE ON THE CROSS. AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. THE ULTIMATE OFGOD'S LOVE AND FOREGIVENESS. JESUS PAID IT ALL, ALL TO HIM I OWE.POWER OF FOREGIVENESS---KARLA FAYE TUCKER"
3,OK,"THIS BOOK WAS JUST O.K.---IT WASN'T BAD, BUT NOT GOOD EITHER. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IT IT HAD SOME PICTURES."
5,ANOTHER TYLER TRIUMPH!,"This is the 5th installment in the Tyler series. The new police chief is a woman, who does things strictly by the book. Her ""second in command"" is a home town hero, who THOUGHT that the job was his and can't believe he was passed over for a woman. This book is FULL of mystery and romance. Just when you think you know what will happen, everything changes! I loved this book!"
3,it's lucky it got three stars from me,"what a disappointment. it's enjoyable, it doesn't make my ears bleed. but it's mediocre at best in comparison to Le Tigre's debut album. Kathleen Hanna and crew seem to have decided to spend more time on feminist propaganda and less time making the music truly interesting to listen to. it drones at times. there isn't a stand-out track in the bunch. even the fairly decent tracks suffer tired guitar monotony and general repetition.i wet myself when i heard Deceptacon and TheTheEmpty, which is more than just a little reminiscent of Bikini Kill songs like Rebel Girl. and MyMyMetrocard? hilarious. but what's to like on this album? an interesting ""message""? the Aqua-esque cover picture? (""i'm a Barbie girl..."")i love you, Le Tigre, but you've lost your way."
2,a disappointment,"i have to agree with the previous reviewers who were disappointed in the new CD. it's pretty similar to the first album but much less inspired, much more boring. buy the julie ruin cd, the 1st le tigre, and most definitely everything ever recorded by bikini kill before checking this out."
1,Just Wrong,"As a big fan of Kathleen Hanna's, I was quite excited when I heard about the coming release of the new album. I have enjoyed Bikini Kill, Julie Ruin, and especially Le Tigre's first LP. Once I had obtained the new album ""Feminist Sweepstakes"" (what a dumb name), I felt extreme fear as I eyed the cover. It just gave me a bad feeling. Then I listened to it. It was horrifying. Way too political. It was as if amidst their obsession with making their powerful statements about ""society"" ""art"" and ""stuff,"" they lost sight of the artistic process. This album was grossly unsuccessful because it focused too heavily on the end statement rather than the music."
3,Popaganda,"It seems to me like LT got some flak for not being political enough on their first album, so they went into overdrive for this one. The new wave tunes are amazing, but it's too preachy. I'm down with the message, but I wouldn't be listening to it if I weren't, you know?"
4,lesbians with techno toys rule the world.,"Le tigre is a close relative of Chicks on speed, but a little less artsy and more palatable to the average listener. long-time punker kathleen hanna brings her years of being out and politically active to this group along with the other two members (i don't know much about their histories). This band is criticized frequently for being ""preachy"" and ""in your face"" about lesbian politics, but at least half the songs on this album are just fun and have nothing to do with politics. I saw le tigre live and it rocked. just like the old days of punk. but with more bleeps. if you liked the movie ""but i'm a cheerleader,"" then this band is for you."
4,Caveat Emptor,"While the video and audio quality is very good, understand this is not a DVD but a DVD-R. Most DVD players can play DVD-R. There are no extras on this disk and, like all other DVD-R's, there are no scene selections either. What you do get is vintage L & H (their first sound feature) and that makes the purchase worth it."
4,Good item,This product fit as advertised. I installed it on my 71 440 Magnum and it works great. Good price too!
2,a very poor effort,"This book is not only poorly edited and proofread, as a previous reviewer said, it is INCREDIBLY poorly edited and proofread. Also, it is not well written. Some entries are very sparase--it seems that the writers know nothing of the movie being honored, or the actor or actress winning the trophy, or the role for which they are winning. Did these writers even bother to see ""A Passage to India""? You wouldn't know it from their discussion of Peggy Ashcroft's best supporting actress win. They wonder at Dianne Wiest forgetting to thank Woody Allen when she won her first Oscar for ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" remarking that Wiest was a frequent star of Allen's movies--but ""Hannah"" was her first movie with Allen. A lot of similar nonsense throughout the book, but it seems to get worse as we get closer to the present, and the carelessness becomes more and more enfuritating."
5,The Definitive book on the Oscars!,"And the Oscar goes to....This Book is very Informative and a must for Oscar watchers. Telling you who should have been nominated, who was nominated and who should of won over who did. Hard to put down and great reference material. Perfect coffee table book available for the coffee stains."
3,Intersting with great images....but could've used a good editing and fact check,"There are so many mistakes in here...read the reviews for a highlight reel. I'll point out another one not listed: at the end of each year, there are lists of the nominees with the winner highlighted in yellow. Michael Caine nomination for 'Alfie' in highlighted depite the fact he lost."
4,Gift for Grandson,"I bought this book for my 12 year old grandson for Christmas. He is a movie buff and had enjoyed another book about the greatest movies ever made co-authored by Jim Piazza. He wrote to me, ""I was very happy with the book you got me on all the Academy Awards. I used it to make a long list of all the awards."""
1,Garbage,"If you're looking for quality transfers of these fine classic films, you won't find it here, this boxed set is pure garbage, there was no attempt at quality transfer to DVD, a real shame, I wonder if we will ever see these films on DVD or Blu-Ray with a quality transfer"
2,Disillusioned...):,"I was very disappointed when I realized that this DVD WAS NOT a collection of Steve Reeves movies, at all. It only has one movie and I could have purchased this movie at a much lower price."
4,A gripping and cautivating novel.,"One of Dickson Car's best opus, it sets the action in a very twisted situation, but the whodunnit plot is very well mixed with an intriguing set of characters. The Detective, Fell, is very impresive too. I totally enjoyed."
4,Great flash,"I am still learning to use all the features of this flash with my new Canon 7d, but what I have found so far is that it is great. I previously used a Sigma 500DG flash, which was half the cost of the previous 550ex flash from Canon. When I updated to the 7d, I found that the Sigma flash does not work in TTL mode on this camera, so I looked at my options. I could send the flash back to Sigma and get it updated, but another newer Sigma that would work, or get the Canon. I decided that since I am a Canon user for life, that I should get the Canon flash. If I had done that originally, I wouldn't have to spend the additional money now since the 550ex would work on the 7d.Everything about this flash is great, except the cost (that is why I knocked off one star). Battery life is great (I am using NiMH rechargeables). I haven't done a lot of off camera stuff yet, but did confirm that this works good with the 7d in wireless mode."
5,Crumbles Cookies Guy,"Great Canon Flash for Ametures who want a good flash. I would have liked to know more about what options were available for flashes, but I'm glad I purchased this one, because it didn't empty my walet, but was still a quality piece of Canon hardware."
5,Cannon Speedlite II Review,"The 430 Speedlite is easy to use and seems to be pretty automatic for correct exposure.The Speedlite is easy to mount and remove from the camera. Love the capability to adjustthe angle of flash. I have not tried a remote operation yet but will soon. I can recommendthis flash unit for anyone but especially if you who have a Cannon camera.Regards,Ralph"
5,Kudos to Amazon,"This is a very nice flash unit, but I've only just received it and tested it to be sure it operates, so can't really provide a proper review yet. This was my second unit. I ordered one and received it on Wednesday, tried it on my camera (Canon EOS 7D) on Thursday and discovered that the flash was defective. Only the pre-flash was firing, so photos came out as though no flash at all was being used. After much troubleshooting to be sure it wasn't something I was doing wrong, I determined that the unit was defective and made arrangements with Amazon Thursday afternoon for a replacement. Incredibly, the replacement unit arrived on Friday, the very next day! The new flash seems to work just fine. The speed at which Amazon sent the replacement was awesome. Thank you, Amazon, for being fast and efficient!"
5,Worth more than it cost!,Reading the manual makes it easy to use. A few practice shots using different settings gets you comfortable with this flash. Well worth its cost.
5,Love this product.,I just used this for an indoor shoot that I had this weekend and it worked like perfectly. It made my images look dreamy instead of getting harsh lights.
2,Not what I expected,"In the beginning I loved this flash. It works great, however, I have recently noticed that the battery starts to slip off it's base (the camera), losing its connection. It almost fell completely off, I put it back on and checked to make sure it was on properly and I could still slide it off."
4,Nice flash,This is a nice flash. A midrange product. I can not believe what BestBuy gets away selling for though. I got it for my wife who is learning herself so I did not want to get a cheap flash. I think this one is perfect for the novice who wants to be more.
5,It makes a HUGE difference.,"It really elevates the look of your photos. There are tons of detailed reviews so I will just add this:Pro: Image quality and overall look and feel of images doubles!Con: If you are using it with autofocus it can be a little slow. I was taking pics of some children at a party (they were hopped up on candy and jumping everywhere) there was no way manual focus was going to happen, and with the flash attached the autofocus was a but sluggish. But, that was with my kit lens on a 60D.Con: Swivel action is somewhat clunkyCon: sometimes it can be a little loud. (makes a mechanical noise)And yes, another con is that this thing is addicting! Try it =}"
5,LOVE this,"i have the canon rebel xsi which i also love. the quality of my photos has improved tenfold since i have always hated the harshness of a built in flash. i had taken pictures at two separate events without this flash and how i wish i could go back and re-do it with the flash. everything comes out FAR more professional but without the excess bulk. i love that it has a built in diffuser, just for ease, though i also have the one that goes on like a cap, though i rarely need to use them because being able to bounce the light up and slightly backwards does a great job.i'm still experimenting with the different things i can do with bouncing the light and can't wait to do another event with the benefits of this flash."
5,Flexible tool for Canon systems,"This flash is wonderful. I have not used all the features, but so far it works very well with the XTi system. There is a learning curve and I have not mastered everything yet. However, my night portraits, with a levels tweek from Photoshop are outstanding---color balance, catch eye, exposure. It does take a while to learn, so you need to invest the time. It is worth the time."
3,Great flash but....,This is a great flash. But i have connection problems with my xti. Sometimes it goes from ETTL to TTL overexposing. This is my turn off. The hotshoe seems to be large for the flash. I dont know if another body will work better. anyone with this problem.. please reply.
3,Good solid flash,This is a good flash that should be in everyone's bag. Sure people will tell you to save money and just get the 430 but if you understand how to use a flash you will appreciate the 580 ability to rotate 180 deg counter and clockwise. That in itself makes the price worth it.Save yourself some money and wait for the spring/winter instant rebates. Canon does this every year so if you miss out just wait a few more months. That way the 580EX II will only run you $360 or less depending on what day you buy it.
4,Only one other Flash is better!,"Use this with a Sto-Fen diffuser and have had great results with my XSi. Really simple use, but am craving more and will invest in the 580 EX II in addition to this to take advantage of better lighting options. Don't get me wrong though, MUCH better than the built in flash!"
3,Overpriced and bad design,"This flash works a bit faster than the 550ex, but frankly couple things are wrong with it:master/slave switch - if you never use it, then no biggie,but I do and this is a PIA to change with the menu. MUCH prefer the old style switch.The hot shoe clamp mechanism - this is awesome. but it does not work with a lot of accessories (too tight).Auto flash functionality - this is also annoying. You have to set a custom function.I prefer more switches, not less. I wish they still make the 550ex, it was all I needed. As it is, this is a terribly overpriced flash that is worse in some ways than 550ex"
4,Flash,This flash is exactly what I needed! Cant wait to get another one so I can use it off the camera with the slave!
5,Amazon & Canon 580EX II,I have to give praise to Amazon and the Canon 580EX II. The delivery was a day ahead of the schedule date of delivery and the pricing is unbelievable compared to anybody else! I will be purchasing another one!
4,Not bad for the price,"If you are a serious photographer, I would go with the 580; as this does not have nearly the range. That being said, it works well when semi-close to the subject."
4,Best on camera flash made,"This is the best on-camera flash Canon makes. I'm sure you can look at any number of full out reviews to tell you all about the specs. I just have 3 things to say.1. I love this flash, I use it almost every time my camera is in my hand and I'm always happy with the results.2. You must have a Sto-Fen Omni Bounce for event photography. It's really worth the extra couple of dollars and it makes your results look great!3. I gave this product 4 stars and not 5 because the user manual that came with the flash, and the menus built in, are USELESS. There are several third party companies that make ""cheat-sheets"" for this flash. Why can't Canon make one and send it with their $400+ flash? The instructions that came with my 40D were great.Anyway, as far as quality of build, and images - Nothing is better. I actually bought 3 of these for my mobile studio. Good luck with menu if you're not using a guide."
3,Canon Speedlite 580EX II,"I'm a professional photographer and I make my living using Canon products. The 580EX II, while ""new and improved"" has a little catching up to do when you speak of reliability. The flash itself does have a number of improvments over the former 580 EX. The hotshoe mount has been redesigned and that's a great improvement. The biggest dissapointment is the misfiring of the unit when you are shooting multiple frames. Even though the flash is supposed to fire even when its not fully recycled, this unit, and many other photographers, units will not keep up, even at close range when the unit still has firepower left. I have missed numerous shots simply because the unit misfired. Bottom line, nice flash unit, redesigned battery door, solid metal hotshoe, a little pricy but generally a decent unit. Just don't shoot sports with it."
4,First External flas,"I got this as the first external flash for my camera. I'm just starting out with photography and found this product very easy to use. The information booklet that came with it is every helpful for trouble shooting (should you have any trouble). I was concerned about the warm up time due to some much older models I have toyed around with, but with my camera set on burst exposures I can take multiple exposures with the flash with no delay. I really do love this flas."
2,Works well until it fails,"The 580EX II is prone to failure. With minimal use, mine failed in less than a year. At first it occasionally misfired, giving blank black pictures. Cleaning the contacts and sliding it on and off the camera seemed to help at first. Now it is just plain dead. I've missed numerous photo opportunities forever.Search the web and you'll find many forums devoted to the various ways this flash can die.Most disappointing is the short warranty. Canon gave me a repair estimate of $180. I paid $450 for the flash unit 10 months ago. This is not right.Other info: The flash was used exclusively on a Canon Eos 7D camera. Used for approximately 1,000 flash photos. With a total cost of $630 for the 580EX II, that comes to $.63 per flash actuation. Not exactly a fun way to enjoy my photography hobby."
3,Great item,I boughtthis item for my new digital camera. It has performed very very well and am very pleased with this flash.
5,You get what you pay for!!,Can you find a cheaper flash? Yes. Will it be what you needed? Probably not. This flash unit is superior to the rest. Make the investment it is well worth the extra money. I've used three other flash units and now I have two of these that are my exclusive tools.
5,Great.,"Flash is as good as reviews suggested it would be. I'm a satisfied Canon customer, as always."
5,Absolutely awesome,This flash really helps in tight situations and the extra power is crucial. Buy it and love it!
4,Great Build and Power,I use this as my key light when doing off camera lighting and my main on camera speedlight when shoot events. it recycles quick and puts out plenty of power. the only downfall is the lack of a slave switch. but its not much of a nuisance. built very tough.
5,Great performance,"My first use of the 430EX II was a prom. The room was completely dark except for the crazy DJ lighting. The flash was good for about 350 shots on one set of regular batteries. Started to slow down after that, and I replaced them at about 400 shots. Great at 10-30 foot range, even while using a Sto-Fen omnibounce diffuser, and even better for 6-10 feet.Highly recommended. I think I paid $290."
5,430EX,"This is a nice flash. It is a back up, and key flash for my 580EXii flash and does what it is supposed to do."
5,Great Speed light,Easy to use and great results. Having fun using it in different environments. Helps to read the instructions.
5,The top of the Line,Been waiting years to be able to afford the 580EX mk2I photograph wildfowl at Bosque del Apache in New Mexico in the winter and if you aint' got a 580 with the X-tender for capturing sunrise and sunset flight of cranes - you aint' nobody!!It is a little technical for an old guy but it performs like a jewel!!
5,EOS 430 EX II,"WHat can I say, it's a Canon, well made, works as expected, plenty of features. Also it's silent when charging between flashes,"
5,Nice flash,I like this flash as it is not to big and recycles much faster than my old flash. I like the way the head swivels so I can bounce off the ceiling in portrait. I think it should be easier to be used as a remote flash without paying more for more stuff. A pc sync would also be great too. Overall I am satisfied and recommend this flash
5,Canon speed light 430 exll,"What a great flash, I like this It works very well on my Power shot sx20is and my eos rebel t2i. It is wonder full fast and allays works and runs for a long time. It is bright enough to illuminate a person on stage form the top balcony."
2,Using it wrong?,"I'm so confused because I'm not having the same luck with this flash as the majority of reviewers here. It seems as though either the battery life barely lasts more than a few pictures, or the flash is just not working correctly. I've changed the batteries three times in an hour and the flash still isn't doing it's job. It just doesn't even go off! If there is enough light in the room, the flash won't work and I just get a grainy in-motion picture. Even my built-in-camera flash does a better job! I feel like I wasted my money, unless I'm doing something wrong? I'm still learning the technical aspects of photography, but I attached the flash, locked in in place, and turned the switch on. The red pilot light comes on. Is there a step I'm missing?! Please help!"
3,"it is alright, and be careful","this is very difficult to use compared to the included flash on the dslr. giving the wrong metering will screw up the photo big time. it doesnt work with 3rd party lenses. my rokinon 8mm lens wont work in the auto mode of the flash, so i must use manual mode.if you use this just be careful, i used it on a hiking trip and somehow it just slid out of the flash shoe and almost broke on the ground."
4,Made in China,"Disappointed that it is made in China. Made in Japan price, though.Should be priced at about $75.00.I like the smaller size compared to the the 580, and I'm sure that they will work well together, but still.The rating is based on the features of the item."
3,Good flash but no PC input!!!!,This is a pretty good flash but there is no pc input!! This makes it impossible to fire the flash using a pocketwizard without buying an adaptor. It's quite ridiculous to handicap a good quality flash in this way.
5,Great lens,"Love this flash. I've been using it all summer, and I got the combo pack that came with the battery charger. I am a hobbyist, and I shoot sports (swimming) so I really need the flash for my work. The flash recharges REALLY fast. The photos have been so awesome that I am now being paid by swim clubs in my area to shoot their meets. I do think the flash has a lot to do with the quality of this work."
5,Most Versitile,I recently purchased this speedlite for my Canon T2i. I absolutely love the versitility of this unit- very easy to use! The refresh time is very fast which makes catching candid moments easy. The flash comes with a case and a stand so that it can be used off-camera.
4,As advertised,"This unit is pretty much as advertised and reviewed, eg on the-digital-picture. A couple of annoying things:o The swivel joint on the flash head stops at 180 degrees facing rearward, when turned in either direction. When bouncing and moving from angle to angle, eg. following a randomly-moving subject, it'd be nice to be able to twist though 360 degrees so that one wouldn't have to think about where it's currently positioned - just rather where one wants it to be. I don't know that any manufacturer's flashes swivel that way, and it's one reason why people use awkward flash brackets.o No battery level indicator. There's no way to gauge how much battery life is left, so one has to keep an eye on the pilot LED, or swap out the battery set proactively before it stops working. This too seems to be a ubiquitous omission across manufacturers, and incomprehensible on a top-of-the-line unit."
5,Best Flash I've Owned,"The fast recycle time and quiet operation are remarkable. Picture quality is excellent, and I particularly like the way that it can be controlled with the camera menus on my 40D. The hotshoe lock is a great feature. The built-in bounce card is small but very helpful for close portraits."
5,canon speedlite 430 exII,i bought this flash because i was not happy with the results i was getting from the built in pop up flash.right out of the box and not even reading about all the possible settings i took fantastic pictures at a family gathering. my wife tried to steel it from me and she also took some great photos.i highly recommend this flash if you want to make a big improvement in your flash photography.a little pricey but money well spent.one of the best purchases i have made in camera equipment.
5,A must have,"The 580 EX 2 has new features that are much better than the previous 580. Faster recycle time, an easier mounting lock, and the battery door that doesn't feel like it will break off."
5,Has Greatly Improved my Indoor Photography,"After reading several reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Canon Speedlite 430EX II flash for my Canon EOS DSLR. With minimal practice, my indoor photography has already greatly improved. It puts out a lot of light and recharges extremely quickly. I was a bit skeptical in shelling out the bucks for a flash but now I wonder how I every got along without one. I have no other models to compare this to, however, I am an extremely happy customer and highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to improve their photography without updating to more costly lenses."
4,Nice Flash,"Arrived very quick. works as described, a little weight to it, but i will get used to it."
5,Added A Whole 'Nother Dimension to my Photos,"I picked this up before going back home for Thanksgiving. I'm pretty new to using external flashes and had researched it a lot on the forums. I will say that it has opened up and improved my photography significantly. This thing is the reason why I've shot the majority of my family's christmas card shots. I'm not a pro by any means, but this thing has helped my photography get to that next lelvel.This thing is pretty simple to operate and fast. A few times using the high-speed-continuous setting on my Canon 7D, this thing kept up. I also picked up a diffuser to mount on it as well. This, along with the swiveling head makes it good for indoor shots. I can soften the light and bounce it to fill in the shadows.I found it handy to always have an extra 4 AA Batteries handy. Not that it's a huge issue, but I usually carry a total of 8 AA rechargeables.I recommend this if you want good flash performance but don't want to spend more on the 580."
4,"A really good flash, but typical canon shotcomings","I've purchased two of these of units, because I use the second on my second camera for weddings, and I'm also experimenting with using a second flash off the camera, via the infrared wireless, which I think is really cool. I have no complaints whatsoever about the flash itself. Very fast, very quiet, very accurate, great recycle time, and the wireless options are really convenient. However, like all other canon products, it is not designed with ""user-friendliness"" in mind. If the camera is used in its most basic modes, it's very simple to use. However, if you want to experiment with other modes, things get pretty confusing, and the owner's manual is no help."
1,Cheaper elsewhere,"Decent flash for Canon, though the newer verion (600ex) is out and cheaper than this. You can purchase the 580ex II on BHPhoto.com for 130 dollars cheaper than you can on here. Its sad how many people feel they are getting a deal anymore on Amazon.If you like this flash, which you will. BUY AT BHPHOTO.COM for a much MUCH better deal."
3,maybe I missed something,"I am by no means an expert on cameras/lenses or flashes. I bought this based on all the great reviews that I saw here. Maybe I was expecting too much or the types of photos that I tend to take perhaps are not effected to such a degree as others here - I do tend to use the aperture wide a lot of the time for portraits with my lenses, the rest of the time I take photos of my kids in the house and garden. I really did not that find great of an improvement.Build quality was good and there are a lot of adjustments on the flash. I think perhaps a lot more for an amateur.For >$200 I though it was not worth it for me so sent it back.I am using an XTi with 50mm 1.8 and 28-135mm Canon lenses."
2,Not enough power,I bought this speedlite over the 580 because of price. I was trying to save a few bucks. I shoot with a canon 40D this spedlite 430EX is not a whole lot better then the flash on my camera. I would not recommend it save the money and go for the 580EX!
3,Very good,"perfect, with this account that I do not need more power. The only bad thing is you need a separate cable to use it divested from the camera .."
3,Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash,"Use as slave to my 580EX Flash to shoot my paintings, so far so good."
5,Sweet Flash!,"I have the 550 EX (used for 10 years) and needed to replace it since it was much slower, especially on recycling flashes. Plus it didn't swivel on the head like the 580 EX and EXII, not as many functions, and becoming quite cumbersome while shooting. I also own the 580 EX. I have only used the new flash a few times and can't say I've noticed a huge difference. But it does seem to recycle a little faster than the first version. So far I am pleased and no complaints. If I do see a noticeable improvement in this version, I'll replace my 580 with this as well."
5,Good Flash,I purchased my Speedlite 430 EX II about 6 months ago and I love it! I purchased it because I was not satisfyed with the flash on my Canon Rebel XS. So far I have had no problems with it.
4,Awesome!,"This is the first flash that I got so I can't really compare it with anything else, but for the value, I'm actually happy with the purchase. I used it during a party and I found that the flash really adds depth to the pictures. Unfortunately the battery I used were the really cheap ones (I was experimenting, I wanted to see how fast the flash can eat up the batteries) and at around 150 shots I noticed that the recycle time was starting to take too long, so long that I began to miss some crucial shots.Initially I wanted to get the 580ex ii, but I don't regret starting off with the 430ex ii... There were some shots where I wish I could use it off cam, but for now, bouncing on walls can still pull it off for me. Go for this... And when you want do decide to get the 580 ex ii, this is still a keeper as it works as the slave."
5,"Canon 580 EX II, great Flash","Have owned a 550 EX for five years or so, and this 580 EXII is a great improvement. Like the metal foot, the swiveling head (both ways) and it seems to be more accurate than my 550. Would highly recommend it, except for the price. But I guess you get what you pay for. Shot a job using ST e2 and umbrella and it did a great job. Using with my old 550EX as both slave (with ST-E2) and as primary flash with 550 slaved. Does a good job.Use it primarily with a 5D Mk2."
5,speedlite rocks,Canon speedlite 430EX II for Canon digital SLR camerastried my Daughters speedlite absolutely loved it had tohave my own. Made a world of difference.
5,Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash for Canon EOS Digital SLR Cameras,"Powerful flash and recycles pretty quick. Good design. Wireless flash worked when the Metz 50 flash would not. The 2 flashes were about the same distance from the transmitting camera (via pop flash). When this flash is mounted on a Canon 60D, it gives the camera the ability to get a focus in a pitch dark room by shining its red grid out - very useful. Wish it were less expensive."
5,Great flash just that..,"Great flAsh Just that the FE buttons on flash are not easily accessible though can be set through *Eos camera body. Overall this flash is great as I expected to be, sufficient power for my xti."
5,Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash,I just love my speed light. It works great and fast. Just what I wanted.
5,PC port....Finally!!!!!,This flash is amazing. I own two of these flashes and can finally purchase a couple of pocket wizards for some off camera flash since the 580EX II has a PC port. This flash is great with a shoot through umbrella or on camera. It will give you a beautiful exposure and has enough power to light almost any situation. Most high ceilings are no problem for bounce flash. All in all a beautifully constructed flash that will satisfy your every lighting need!!
5,A must have!!!,"Es la actualización perfecta para la cámara, las nuevas fotos cobran vida utilizando este flash de alto rendimiento. Lo recomiendo ampliamente. Quizás es algo grande en tamaño y te debes acostumbrar al nuevo peso de tu cámara en tus manos."
2,Have to send it in to Canon for repair already,"I just purchased this in April, and am already having to send it into Canon. Shooting a wedding this weekend the flash just turned off, and will not turn back on. Imagine the horror, NEVER buying from these people again :("
4,Gift - But I'm Told it Functions Great,"Purchased as a gift, but I'm told it a great flash for the price. Easily snaps right on, and ready to go."
5,700 Plus,Decided To No Go Cheap And Get The 580EX II. Had 700 5 Star Reviews And Hardly Any 1 Star's When I Bought It. Very Good High Quality Flash. So hear is another 5 Star to help get you to 1000
4,Speedlite 430Ex II flash,"Good flash for beginners, good results. Have to wait 10 minutes if you take a lot of shots in a row."
5,LOVE MY 580,I love the flash. I've used lower model and off brand flashes. This is a great investment.
5,flashy and practical,"I have only just begun to use this flash, but found it useful right out of the box. While I'm still learning about lighting, the automatic TTL with this is a boon, but it's also great to be able to make adjustments to the automatic settings to compensate for moments I want more or less light.I love the way the head swivels in many directions, which means I can bounce it off ceilings or walls or whatever. I also got the stofen omni bounce, which is a very nice addition for not a lot of money, and it has gotten some use indoors with family pictures.I can't compare this to off-brand TTL flashes, but I can say I like this flash and highly recommend it."
4,I do love this flash but....,"It is powerful, well built and floats. Yeah you read that right. The first time I used it outside for some portraiture my assistant knocked the light stand over and the flash ended up in the river. I was able to save it after some work and still use it a year later. One thing I don't like are the cryptic custom functions. One of the first times I used it I was shooting off camera at a wedding and the flash use to power down. I didn't have a manual with me so I could change the programming and ending up breaking out the old Vivitar flash to get me by. These days I carry a copy of the custom functions page in my camera bag.All the best!,Brian Carey[…]"
5,Turned my camera into something special!,This turns your camera into something real! I can believe how my camera can go from novice to PRO by just adding the flash. I would never go anywhere without it :)
5,Canon Speedlite 430EX II,"I am so glad I went with this Speedlite rather than go cheap and get a compatible ""off brand"" light. Quality is excellent. It's pretty easy to use, just pop it on your camera and go. I have only used it for a short time but the quality of my photos has improved dramatically specially when I use it off camera wirelessly. I'm sure there is a lot more that this light can do than what I've done so far. Just need to learn all the tricks and get more experience with it. I could go on and on about how much I like this Speedlite. All I really have to say is if you don't have a flash BUY this. The only thing better is the 580EX II, which will be my next flash purchase. Also the price I got here was $80-$100 less than I have seen it at retail stores. Comes with a nice little carry case and stand."
5,Happy and useful,I love this flash. pictures look much nicer with it. It is a little bit heavy though with the weight of 4 batteries as well.
4,Bringing in action shots a night that were impossible before,Took some shots at night out at SpeedWorld last week of some riders doing aerials off ramps that put them 50+ feet above me and 70-80 feet away. My Canon T3i built-in flash gave me streaked images before at even 1600 iso and flood lights.With my new Canon 430EX II I was getting clear full exposure photos.
4,-Great Little Flash-,"I bought this flash to use along with the ""Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 ImagingBody + 18-55mm lens."" I read the reviews here and based on that decided to buy it. I'm glad I did!!"
5,"If you need a lots of light, this is the one for you","Great flash and a must for heavy duty photographer! It is big and powerfull, for home user maybe over kill.Charles N."
5,Canon Speedlite 580 EX,This is one of the nicest flashes that I used. I work really well with my canon 40D camera. The optional functions of the flash really work well inside and out.
5,Excellent Flash,Excellent flash with lots of features. The metal base is a nice upgrade over previous models and adds a measure of durability. Also has a long battery life (with lithium batteries). I take a lot of pictures in dark nightclubs and bars. Most of these pics require a room-illuminating flash with lots of coverage. This flash works great in those environments.
5,Should Have Spent the Extra Money the First Time,"I upgraded from Speedlite 430EX. What an amazing difference! The batteries last quite a bit longer, recycle time is faster. This flash unit is larger, but feels bulletproof. It has new features designed to integrate with the 1D Mark III camera's interface, however I don't own that camera and can't tell you how that works.This flash has an improved quick connect feature. It uses a lever that slides over and locks into place rather than the little wheel that you used to have to crank on. It also has a rubber seal to keep out dust and moisture at the mount.I love it. Well worth the extra money over the 430EX. I wish I bought this flash to begin with."
4,Excellent,"makes indoor pics and nighttime pics soooo much better. a lot of different functions that i don't know how to use but for the professional, I'm sure there great! Highly reccommended!!"
5,Only one little hitch,"This unit works well and seems to couple terrifically with my 5d. I was not as happy with the results from the first 580EX and my 20d but I don't know where the fault was.The only little hitch is that the master-slave control was easier with the old unit. It was a simple push of a lever. Now you have to go through a menu. This is not serious enough to remove a star, so count this a satisfied user."
5,Great Flash,Simply great with all my canon cameras. I tested with 5D and 20D. It's simple to use and battery life is good too.
5,Canon Speedlite 430EX II,This a very nice flash. Little confusing to use at first but very versatile and useful.Item came quickly and was just as advertised.
2,I can't believe I spent more then 10 bucks for this,"Perhaps at the time this was considered a great movie. Me being a bondage fan was looking forward to this film with high enthusiasm. What I found was just far too low in terms of quality. I'm not looking for James Cameron quality but I was expecting this film to stress on the fantasy as opposed to straight-out sex in every scenario.To keep it short.Pros: some decent looking women and has bondage.Cons: the women may be decent looking but don't meet what you'd expect, poor execution, you should stick to watching Baywatch."
4,"Another Tenacious ""T""","I'm a big fan of Jack Black's and have turned on alot of people to his ""rockings"". My latest victim was my brother. We call each laughing about the politically charged lyrics and naughty nymph-like attitude Jack and his partner bring to the rock world. I gave my bro one of the CDs and a shirt last year. He already bought the new CD, so it's only fitting that he have another Tenacious ""T"". This is a good product made of comfy material. It arrived in excellent shape and swiftly."
5,"""You bloodsucking leech! ..."" What's not to like?","While there's some campy moments that almost detract, the political undertones (both commercial imperialism AND excessive taxation are pelted on, so writer Robert Holmes was able to stick it to everybody!) more than make up for it.Very unusual but very good story for 1977, which was written 4 years before Western society started its form of commercial imperialism. :-)Definitely a must-see. But if you're not fond of stories that dare play with social scenarios, stay away. Reality bites."
3,The Wrong Sweets,The only aspect of this story that makes my blood boil is near the start when the Doctor is trying to save Cordo's life he tries to tempt him away from the ledge by offering him a Jelly Baby then as the Doctor eats a sweet It's clearly seen the sweet is not a jelly Baby it's a LIQUORICE ALLSORT. Just what on Earth is going on with BBC standards.....
3,Doctor Who - The Sunmakers,"Arriving at a human colony living in an artificial biosphere on Pluto, the doctor discovers a citizen on the verge of committing suicide because of an impossible tax burden. Aiding the resistance, the Doctor discovers that the corrupt corporation controlling the colony is being run by an evil alien..."
4,good,I purchased this for my father so I hope he likes it. I bought this exact same shirt in Myrtle Beach.
4,"Flawed, but still amazing","I rated this video four stars instead of five because, while I have nothing personal against Linda Francis, in my view her approach to spiritual development (meditative and partner-based exercises) is tired, ineffective in the long term, and detracts from Zukav's message. There is a deafening chord of truth that resounds from Zukav that simply does not eminate from Francis.The bottom line is, a basic intellectual and emotional understanding of Zukav's philosophy renders these kinds of meditative exercises unnecessary. I would have much preferred seeing Zukav going in depth, one-on-one with the participants of this program."
3,"A ""Good"" Album","This album is definitely not in the same league as the debut album. It can't be compared to ""Somewhere I've Never Traveled"" because it is so different. It is however a good solid album. I love it because I'm an Ambrosia fan. All I can say is for me it is just a ""good"" album. If you love the pop sound over their deeper former sound it is possible this could be your favorite Ambrosia album. Listen to the clips and decide."
4,LIFE BEYOND LA,"LIFE BEYOND LA was Ambrosia's last album emphasizing their progressive rock roots. Many Ambrosia purists fault the success of pop ballad HOW MUCH I FEEL for the band's commercial sellout. I like all of Ambrosia's music (except for the feeble ROAD ISLAND) and their hit singles are just fine in my book.Along with the aforementioned HOW MUCH I FEEL, several tracks are outstanding: the frenetic energy of the title tune; the poignant HEART TO HEART; the pathos of IF HEAVEN COULD FIND ME and the cynical goofiness of ANGOLA. I also liked DANCIN WITH MYSELF and NOT AS YOU WERE. As always, the musicianship is impeccable and Joe Puerta and David Pack provide excellent lead vocals. While LIFE BEYOND LA is not my favorite Ambrosia, I appreciate their obvious musical artistry. A must for 70's afficionados."
3,"Historically Accurate, Visually Complex","I got this for my 12 year old son. I thought the explanations of each picture were very detailed and informative. Unfortunately, the pictures themselves proved to be very detailed as well, which, for my son, proved to be daunting. I wished the images involed simpler contour drawing."
2,Great photos but ponderous writing,"Great photos but ponderous writing. Page 83 excerpt, ""The architects clearly enjoyed the possibilities of this experimental architectural archeology whereby a fundamentalist concept of authenticity is replaced by an inclusive and imaginative view of historical processes."""
3,Be sure before you order,"I have order from Amazone for more than two years. My order is prompt and conplete.Be sure and tell your friends and family that their order is safe secure.WWE The Music - A New Day, Volume 10 (Amazon.com Exclusive)"
1,Not worth it,This was an awful quality of work and would not recommend this movie to anyone. This movie was like a bootleg movie. I saw people walking in the theater and the sound quality was TERRIBLE. Take this movie out of your system.
1,what a woman wants what a man needs,"i rate this item below the title level, it is a play but the play itself is not all that, i felt that the some of the actors did not give enough of the chacter that they was playing. also the title was good but overall, the play was bad"
5,Funny and Great Movie!,My DVD arrived ahead of its arrival date it was in mint condition I have no complaints thanks for the great service.
5,IT WORKED! SIMPLE HOOKUP!,"I was not sure if it made a difference with or without Dual Ferrites, but this cable worked well with a simple connection. MacBook Pro (DVI) to a Samsung LCD TV (HDMI) hookup.Seen one for half the price but without the Dual Ferrite. Paid alot for the Samsung didn't want to risk interference."
1,Mine had no ferrites...,"What I received was just a common, bargain grade HDMI cable. It works, but whether it's causing more interference (or is vulnerable to more interference) than the dual ferrite cable that I actually paid for, I have no idea.I notice that this item has ""rotating vendors"". Today, it says ""In Stock. Sold by SF Planet"". A few days ago, when I ordered mine, it said ""Sold by eForCity"". I guess you have to check reviews for the ""vendor of the day"" in addition to reviews of the particular product.Thanks for nothing, eForCity."
5,Excellent holder for the price!,The Bucket Boss is a very sturdy holder with a nice METAL clip. No cheap plastic parts here. The case is a nice woven nylon like in backpack straps. Its an excellent product.
3,Its ok,I think the quality is ok but the design is lacking it's a little to big. It very long and its clip is located very close to the top so whole thing hangs down very low on your hip which is ok when standing up but can make it very hard to sit in an office chair with arms
2,Not appropriate for motorcycle usage,"Whilst these are probably OK for bedtime use, they don't work well when on a motorcycle. They come out of the ears easily. I'd recommend traditional foam compress/expand earplugs instead."
1,Does not offer good protectioN,The wax is very hard and difficult to fit inside the ear and is not comforable. Look for the alpine professional hearing protection.
2,Too Small,"I bought these ear plugs because I've tried many different types and I usually find that the wax style ones are too big for my ears (I'm female & 5'5""). Ironically, I find these ear plugs to be too small and they don't fill up the area enough to cover the opening of my ear and block the sound of snoring dogs or snoring boyfriend."
4,Love Psychic Experiment,"Was anxious to watch Psychic Experiment so I decided to rent it on a quiet Sunday night. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. There were several scenes in Psychic Experiment that caught my eye that I will not mention-don't want to give out any spoilers. It was one of the most original scfi movies that I have ever scene. This movie has really incredible special effects that will not disappoint. It was really great to see Adrienne King back in a movie again!!! Also wonderful performances from Debbie Rochon, Reggie Banister and well everyone in the film!!! Please check out Mel House's very impressive film!!!"
1,"Terrible, terrible video.","How Katie Featherston decided to attach herself to this project is beyond me. The only reason I rented it, in fact, was because she was in it, and I expected something at least as professionally made as the Paranormal Activity trilogy. This one sinks far below that to the barely watchable. Katie is barely in this (which is probably good for her future hopes to work in better films). The plot, acting, setting, photography, etc., are all beyond amateurish. This video stuck me more as something a stoned, untalented community college film student would throw together as his final thesis film. It's really just...terrible. Save your money for something - anything - but this."
5,A wonderful little book,"Relationships are never all that straight, by the rules. This is a wonderful little book, both witty and wise. In one story an older woman comforts a young bride, gets her drunk and ... In another a woman goes on holiday looking for love, but only meets an old, fat man ... And the title story is hilarious!This is the kind of book whose stories wil make you laugh ... and think. The ideas Greene presents will stick with you to be contemplated and savored long after you've set the book aside."
3,Kind of creepy yet interesting,More of a tragic comedy than anything. A series of short stories all with a twist into the lives of humanity.
4,Hilarious,"When two gay men set their sights on an unhappy honeymooner in Italy, a disturbingly funny series of events take place. The story ends on a similar note, hilarious, and yet somewhat frightening."
1,creepy and disturbing,"I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have ""a bit on the side."" And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Still Holds Up,George Seagal and Glenda Jackson are wonderful in this comedy about extramarital affairs. You also get to see a very young Paul Sorvino.
3,A TOUCH OF CLASS,"This film was so popular in my 20 s and I have not seen it since then but now in my 50s although very funny at the beginning it was so disapointing at the end ,although I did remember how the movie ended it was not that romantic film my mind had clung to .This film is watchable, and will make you smile to begin with but it does fade quickly .The scenery of London was how it was then, and the quaint little shops that we all know and love London to have, were just so London and you will love this part.Anyone who purchases this film ,and watching it for the first time will probably love it, but for those of us walking down memory lane my suggestion is ,just keep your memories ,that way you will not be let down ."
2,"Very dated, but it has its moments","Attitudes have changed quite a bit since 1973. Anyone born after 1980 will have trouble deciphering this film's severely dated sexual politics. But it is still worth watching, if only for Glenda Jackson's spot-on performance. She infuses the limp dialogue with brio and charm; she is alternately fiery and vulnerable, and she steals every scene. Jackson beat out Ellen Burstyn for the Oscar, apparently because the academy was too freaked out by THE EXORCIST to seriously consider it as a contender. Time has provided the appropriate corrective; this film is virtually forgotten, while THE EXORCIST is still scaring the pants off of people. Give it a whirl, see what you think."
3,Touch of Class,"One of our all time favourite movies, but we were disappointed with the quality of the print. The film had obviously been 'stretched' and the sound quality was poor. Seems that the transfer to DVD did not work well."
5,One of my all time favorites!,"Love this movie and it's never become dated. George Segal and Glenda Jackson are perfectly cast, and the comedy is timeless. A married man who never cheats on his wife ""in the same town"" meets an attractive woman who is also interested in no strings sex for a week in Malaga. What happens to them just trying to get to Malaga is hysterical, and him trying to make airline reservations is the funniest scene ever.Buy this movie! It's one of those you can watch over and over again!"
3,Teaching Other People's Children,"This was an insightful book. I enjoyed the author's love for children of a different culture. I fell in love with the children while reading it. As teachers, we should always be flexible enough to learn new ways of teaching because all children are different. Every day is a new day!"
3,Tigers in Combat 11,"Quite a good reference to the SS and GD heavy tank battalions . I would prefer to see a few more color renditions and a more descriptive text. Other than that, it is a good value for money reference for anyone interested in the deployment of Tiger units. It has more value as part of the two volume set rather than as a single volumeI would recommend for modellers as a good reference work"
2,Poor Reprint,"As other reviwers have stated, the two volumes provide valuable, and interesting information on this legendary tank, and the units that used. it. However, the photo reproduction is a travesty; you may as well be viewing them in a dark room, through vaseline covered glasses. The publisher is to be condemned for allowing this to occur. At $30.00 for a softcover book, or $60.00 for both volumes, it is not good value. I actually bought volume one after much indecision, then decided that I would not repeat my mistake on volume two. If the photos were better, it would rate at least 4 stars."
3,"Many hopes, but...","I waited from much this book, but it has disappointed me. The documentary materials are raw by the author and frequently are inconsistent. It's simply war dearies of panzer units with a very weak historical scientific component."
2,Apollo Years / BOX SET is mis leading,"i was a little disapointed with the packaging. I expected more of a comprehensive review of her History throughout this period. I experienced very little change in musical style over what is a lengthy period in any artist's carrer. I guess I expected more raw authenticity. Instead, I guess i got more digitized flat line"
2,OK BUT NOT GREAT,"MY CHILD WHO IS ALMOST 2, LOVES TRUCKS. I READ THE REVIEW'S AND TROUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT, BUT THERE IS TO MUCH TALKING AND NOT ENOUGH OF THE TRUCKS.NOT RECOMMENED FOR YOUNG TRUCK LOVERS!"
2,Slooooooow!,"The item was somehow misdirected and took weeks to arrive. The sender did send an email to tell me what happened after I was asked for a review and said I'd review it if it ever arrived. This was a gift for my great-grandson who is crazy about garbage trucks. His mother said it's an o.k. video but may be better for a child 4-6 years old. There's narrative about recycling, etc., way beyond a child under three. But he's interested in seeing the trucks in action."
3,"Well, my son likes it...","Movie is something out of, like, the mid 90's. I found it to be annoying as hell, but my 3 year old loves it-too much. It hasn't left the DVD player in a month, and it's on as I type this review. I no longer watch the news without hearing, ""I wanna watch firetruck!!"""
5,still loves to watch,My two sons are now 9 and 12 but when these dvd's were on videotape they loved them. They have every one and they still have all the VCR tapes.My boys will once in a while pop one of these tapes in the VCR and they still enjoy watching it at their age. I also like the shows. They were so funny. I am now purchasing the dvd's for a nephew and for a friends 2 year old. Hope they have as much fun wathching as my boys did.
3,Too scary for our 2 year old,"The write-up does say it's for ages 3-8, but our son loves garbage trucks, so we got it for him anyway. Two scenes made him cry so much that we'll probably have to shelve the video: one where ""Garbageman Dave"" falls into a garbage truck, which drives off, with Dave's legs kicking in the air; another where ""Dave"" and ""Becky"" get out of the garbage truck and it drives off without them. Both of these scenes, and most of Dave's antics, are really not needed. Not sure I'd want a kid of any age to see grown-ups doing this kind of goofy, dangerous stuff. But overall, the DVD is a good effort with lots of interesting things for kids."
3,2 year old lost interest,"All in all an ok Dvd. Did not hold the interest of my 2 year old who is facinated with trucks, fire trucks. It was a little slow moving at times due mainly to the narration and interviews."
5,real wheeles - truck adventures ( there goes a fire truck),I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old for Xmas. He loves it! I would highly recommend this dvd. It is very educational and keeps him very interested.
2,Not as good as the others,"My 22 month old son loves Dave, but these videos with Becky are hard to watch. They are just too campy. We enjoy the ones where it is just Dave by himself like the Train, Plane, Bus, Tractor etc... Sorry, Becky - Dave's the man."
3,Annoying,"Dave has to be one of the most annoying hosts ever. Sadly, he's in all the videos and equally annoying in all of them. My son, age 2 and 1/2, really enjoys this series but it seems to be in spite of Dave, not because of him! He loves the machines but can lose interest in the other 'plots' and Dave's 'interviews'. I think, as he gets older, my son will appreciate these more. However, I'll save them for visits with grandparents or a sitter, just for my own sanity. I Dig Dirt and Twent Trucks are better."
2,disappointing,"My son loved the ""firetruck"" video so much I bought 5 more in the series.We've only watched 'garbage truck' and 'trucks' so far but we HATE them. Dave seems to have lost his mind - or maybe he's drunk? He babbles, rambles stream of concious, berates Becky...and there is WAY too much of Dave and Becky and not enough of the trucks.The only one we watch is 'firetruck' the rest is garbage."
4,2 yr old gives it 2 thumbs up!,"since there are 3 episodes on one disc i definitely felt i got my money's worth. at first my 2 yr old son was only interested in the garbage truck episode, which is really great - entertaining, funny, & informative. we watched it several times a day, often in a row! now he will watch the other episodes as well, although they are not as engaging for him bc they have a lot more information and less action."
4,4 yr old enjoys,"Almost too much info., does seem to drag on for mom but my 4 yr. old enjoys watching it."
1,Pretty stupid.,"There is too much face time for the campy actors/producers stupid skits than actual truck action. I'm sure a lot of people think these are great, and they are truly harmless. But I'm sorry I put any cash in the pockets of these dorky self absorbed profiteers. Snakeskin boots? Awful."
1,These are the worst ever!,"My son loves ""real life"" trucks and big machines, so I thought these would be fun for him to watch. They are not, in fact they don't even hold his attention. Dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids. Just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on Dave. I have since bought the I Love CAT Machines series and they are fantastic."
2,It is about the actor rather than the tricks,"I do not show this to my grandson any more. it is more about a man who appears to be stupid, who does crazy things to try to b e funny. This is not the image of a construction worker that I want him to see. The trucks are good, though, if you can get past, ""I shouldn't have done that!"""
5,there goes a firetruck,I have a son who has learned so much from the There goes a... series. I was very pleased to find out the series is now being released on DVD. I already own many in the series on video. Now that I have a DVD player I am looking forward to purchasing the rest of the series I do not have on DVD. My son is absolutely enamored with Dave and likes to pretend he is Dave when he plays with his cars and trucks. It is also the most popular birthday party gift I buy for my sons friends. It makes an ideal gift. Thanks to the people at Theres goes a ... series for creating what I feel are the best childrens videos on the market. We look forward too more new title's in the future.
1,There goes a truck,"Too much commentary, very little coverage of trucks in action. Did not keep the interest of my preschooler."
1,So sleazy you actually giggle at some points!,"Sleazy 70s exploitation film with some panache features super-agent Ginger chasing down white slavers. Ample sex and violence will please certain contingents while semi-feminist heroine, campy dialogue will satisfy others."
2,Decent but not great,I liked some things about this book:cluster chapterhardware coverageWindows Server 2003 tidbitsI didn't like other things:replication coverage - way to short to be useful. Doesn't tell much about high availability in relation to replicaton.bad advice - several things they recommend even I know better than to do. I got to the point where I started ingoring the recommendations and just hunted for facts to help me form my own conclusions.performance stuff -- its to weak and not discussed as much as it should be. I think you need to really go into performance issues when you talk about high availability because poor performance makes a system less available.I guess the final word is that this is a decent book that you might want to get if SQL SERVER high availability is something you need to know about. Just don't expect a great book.
2,Has some good points but could be much better,I just got this one and I found that while it has some good points its not really all I had hoped. A much better book is Inside SQL 2000. It covers much more about SQL which you need to know for keeping a system up and running 24-by-7.
1,Not what I was expecting,More a collection of misc thoughts than really good info on high availability.
1,Hodge-podge of bad advice and glib generalizations,"Has to be the worst Sql book I've wasted my money on. Absolutely horrible. Practically every chapter has some over generalization or plain bad advice. You get the impression that the authors haven't really ever deployed any of these systems they talk about so much. It appears they have very little time ""in the trenches."" On top of that, the writing is just awful. I had a real tough time just reading through it. If you want to find good info on Sql's high availability features, read the Books Online and *don't* waste your money on this book."
2,Disappointing,I got this one to help me with setting up a HA replication arch. To be nice about it the repl info in the book is anemic. Next to nothing about it. I'm not sure how I will use the book and Im pretty disappointed iwth it.
4,Spooky,"This mix album is definitely worth the effort and money to grab it. It is eclectic, as is most from Spooky. He still reigns as my fave DJ, seeing him spin those tables is a surreal site. As it says on the package, this album doesn't bank on some current dance-floor trend. It is Spooky showcasing his many influences and favorite tracks. Those range from Sonic Youth's ""Tremens"" to Moby's ""Sound"". He mixes his own collaborations into the cd as well to create a mix cd like none I have heard. Overall, it is a compelling listen, and a very varied album that I can listen to no matter what my mood."
2,DJ Spooky That OVERRATED Kid,"I don't know what all the fuss is over DJ Spooky. I've heard a few tracks mixed by him and I own a copy of his Riddim Warfare album, but this album is the last straw.As eclectic as he his, he may be too eclectic as he tries to mix from genres too diverse. Though I appreciate the fact that he doesn't go for the trendy anthem-type dancefloor hits and experiments with more rare tracks, the result is, I think, unmelodic and uninspiring torture. I think that it's not so much his talent mixing as it is his taste in track selection that makes this album so awful. Riddim Warfare is much better in my opinion.My advice is - don't waste your money. There are plenty of other albums out there that are more deserving of your money."
1,A Golden Opportunity Lost!,"Given the number of Discoveries and Range Rover Classics in service and the arguably very high percentage of owners who perform their own maintenance, there must exist a very large market for a book which is a collation and presention of maintenance tips and repair methods and which goes beyond the elementary basics, and offers more detail and anecdotal advice than the various workshop manuals. This book, unfortunately, is not it. It wimps out before offering anything other than the barest first steps in many of the repair projects it describes. For example, under the section describing changing the automatic transmission filter, the advice given may be summed up as ""Don't"". Most every seasoned maintainer has done this task at least once, and those others, who would purchase such a book, would, no doubt, very much like to know what the job entails.The title 'Step by Step' would be better stated as 'Elementary First Steps'. Overall, a bitter disappointment!"
1,Other Repair Manuals Available on UK site,"I was looking for a repair manual and found two on the uk amazon site, here is the link if you are interested.http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-4384658-3503057Both books listed are by haynes, one states they don't ship internationally, however you may negotiate this(it may just be the shipping cost is greater internationally)..."
5,Corelle at its finest,"I purchased a service for 12 of this pattern for my ""everyday"" dishes plus the serving platterand serving bowl. I love it all. The serving pieces are stoneware and are heavier than traditional correlle but they are a great size and quite functional...I may even order a second of each as we use these dishes everyday and have a large family. The coffee mugs aretiny, but we don't use them much so I don't mind the small size. I would order all pieces again."
1,don't buy,"Don't buy this product. about one week after i bought this watch, I was trying to adjust the time, the adjusting pin came out, which I could never fix. Why should it be so fragile when i paid $100? the look was good though"
2,Bad for me but depends on the taste.,"It is very small so that fat men like me is not going to be good, is going to be very small like a woman's watch."
5,very good item,"very good item, so nice, perfect and elegant. I enjoy it so much. I receved it before the normal time, from usa to mexique."
3,New Invicta 9211,"Keeps excellent time, weight and feel are significant for $80 but its chronograph function does not work, otherwise a good timepiece. >>> A previous review comparing movements in the ""old"" versus this ""new"" 9211 model, about the change to a non-working chronograph movement, is accurate and informative. The stock photo published on Amazon (as of 3/6/12) depicts the ""old"" 9211 face. In the new model, there are no markers at 3 and 9 as sub-dial design trumps functionality. An Invicta rep commented that the new 9211 is a design-driven model that required movement modifications targeted to appeal to a larger market."
4,Good for the price but no miracles,"It's good for the current price (which is substantially below a c-note). If you like the looks of the Daytona, you will like the looks of this watch. The bracelet is good for this price class, but not great; I have a couple of Swiss Legend watches in the same price class with superior bracelets. There is a bit of rattle to the bracelet due to the cheap, stamped clasp. The Japanese quartz movement is typically accurate for a quartz."
5,A great deal from Amazon!,"My Invicta Speedway Chronograph S Watch arrived Friday, several days before I anticipated its delivery and, though not highly relevant, I was impressed with the way it had been packed.I like the watch very much. The bracelet fitted perfectly and the watch took minimal set up time. I read the manual and everything works as I expected it to.The luminous hands have a lot more glow than previous watches I've owned and the watch looks expensive... which is precisely why I bought it!It's a bargain at Amazon's $120 price."
2,better than it looks,"Product arrived in a small box, when i opened it, the band was not connected to the watch so i had to fix it myself, and the watch was really light from what it really looks like. I thought it wasn't worth the money, so i returned it."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This watch looks good but the movement is terrible. I got this watch as a Christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand. I must warn you, if you purchase this watch then don't be suprised if it doesn't work right. It may look like a Rolex but it doesn't work like one."
1,really angry,"con mucha rabia ya que envien un correo electronico al fabricante invicta ya que el relos se le partio el cristal siendo que es un reloj para una persona activa joven debe ser mas resistente y no recibi ninguna respuestas de ellos gracis ya que se que amazon es bastante serioreally angry, and they send an email to the manufacturer Morelos unbeaten since he broke the glassthank you"
4,More than just a Rolex Daytona look alike,"I love this watch. This is one of the best watches you can buy at this pricepoint. The materials that make up this watch are high grade, and durable. This watch has a classic look to it, it is great as a casual watch, a watch to wear to work or for a night on the town.I highly reccomend this timepiece prior to this purchase I thought that Invictas were cheap look alike watches but my perception has been quickly changed. I think that this is a better or comparable watch in styling and finish than many of the ""top brands"" out their today. The only downside is that it is not an automatic."
2,Only package is special..,The product is not as good as the pictures. They make it sound a great deal by showing the original price as 388 odd dollars. The fact is i would not pay more than $40.00...Pros..PackageCons..Everything else is a joke..
2,not as described,"The Amazon description of the movement was wrong, and all this time later is still wrong. Beware anyone who wants this watch to be a chronograph. Unlike any quartz movement I know, the large center hand is the seconds hand, while the tiny dial at 6 o'clock contains the chrono second hand. You can't time anything that way. Further, the tachymeter cannot be used, for obvious reasons.If you want a watch that looks like a chronograph but behaves like a regular watch, then buy this one. But if you want a chronograph, stay away.The description doesn't reveal any of this. It actually says it measures time to within 1/60th of a second!Very disappointing. Only got a second star because Amazon took it back and paid return shipping."
3,backwards,"packaging nice, arrived right on time, watch looks expensive. One problem i noticed, the watch functions completely backwards. The watches actual second hand tics(large second hand), and the chrono second hand, at the 6 O clock subdial act as the chronograph.This is the complete oppisite of the way a chronograph functions. I am not big on chronographs any way . I will not send it back, i will use it as a work watch. I like having a moving second hand all the time any way. And as long as both second hands are not moving at the same time I dont think there will be any difference in the battery drainage. Hey the watch was 79.00 what do you expect. If this watch is supposed to function this way would someone let me know?"
5,Excellent!!!,"I have been wearing this watch for a year now with no complaints. This is very masculine and chunky and yet it fits persons having smaller wrists like me. I had to shorten the metal band a couple of links which I did myself with ease. It feels great, looks great and a great buy. Had plenty of appreciations for it. Overall a superb buy."
4,nice watch looks more than its worth,its nice the only things that i dont like its a little small looking and im a small guy also im only 5'6 and i think it looks small on my wrist but thats my issue. other than that its a very nice watch.
5,A must have watch.,"This is my 2nd Invicta watch but unfortunately lost it in Phi Phi Island while making a dive off the yacht. I bought it after owning the legendary 8926 and was amazed by the quality and the feel for that price. For those who complain about the subdials not working I recommend you read the manual, the 24 hour subdial is suppose to work with the main watch to show you if its day or night just like the GMT watches.Am I going to buy another one? Sure I am."
1,Editing My Previous Review,"I reviewed this watch when I originally bought it...sad to say that it broke within a year. The time was wildly off. I don't think it was worth the money. My original review is as follows:I bought this watch for my younger brother for his birthday.I have to agree with previous posts - this watch is beautiful.It has the right amount of heaviness to it and looks like any other luxury watch in terms of quality.I am sure that there are major differences between how his watch and a Rolex operate, but if you're simply looking for a beautiful watch, this is it.My brother is quite large - 6'5"" and 200 lbs - and this watch was a great size."
1,Invicta Watch,"This watch appeared to be just what I wanted and glad to receive it. Unfortunately it didn't work so I was very displeased. The ""crown"" which you pull out to set the time and date would not move, so I returned the watch."
4,Very Nice,"The major down side is that it is not a sapphire glass, but for the price I would not expect that anyway!Oh! And the size seems a little smaller on the wrist! The case is big, but the actual viewing area is small, makes its looks like a tiny watch!"
4,pleasantly surprised,"When I opened the box what I expected was something that only looked like a Rolex Daytona. Instead, what I got was a watch that performs like a Rolex Daytona. And at an unbelievable price. I expect to keep this watch a long time."
4,Good looks but no substance,"Great looking watch. Seems to keep time to within one second a day variance. Stop watch function is useless for any detailed measurement with increments in 5 minute blocks. Otherwise, she's a real looker..."
3,"Nice watch, hate the box it comes in..","The watch is very nice for a man. The only problem I have is that it comes in BIG yellow box, not exactly the color I would choose for a man, but to each person their own, Invicta do me a favor- stay with black, or some more neutral coor for a man's watch please!"
5,vendedor responsable,"mercancía en buen estado, llego al tiempo estipulado por el vendedor, lo recomiendo son relojes originales muy lindos los recomiendo"
3,Cheap Rolex Daytona,"Invicta makes cheap Rolex knock-offs for those who want the Rolex look but not the Rolex price. Keep in mind a $100 watch will not perform like a $10,000 watch. I've owned several Invictas over the years and they work ok but they are not serious watches. They are good-looking, but that's about it. The 9211 is a knock-off on the Rolex Daytona and looks good, but don't expect to use it to time your next yacht race."
4,Great value.,"This is my second Invicta watch, and I am pleased once again. For $116 (on 6 May 08, but the price has gone up a little) this is a very handsome watch. As with all Invictas with the brushed outer and polished inner band, be careful if you wear your watch at the computer as the polished center portion is easily scratched.As far as the actual chronograph function goes, I cannot imagine that too many people would be buying a watch like this if they were serious about timing events."
4,Nice Watch for the Money,"For about $100 this is a very decent watch. It looks good and keeps accurate time. It's not a Rolex, but I didn't pay for one. The chrono model was chosen because it looks cool, and frankly I haven't even made use of that feature. I'd recommend the #9211."
1,Rip off,Bought this item using the find parts from amazon paying 2 day delivery Shipping & Handling: $10.98. They sent the wrong part not compatible w/ my 1994 Ford Mustang now I have to pay out of my refund $5.08 to return the part. Because their negligence it cost me an extra $16.07 not counting the aggravation and waste of time; think twice prior ordering parts using Amazon find parts .
3,OEM is a brand,OEM is a brand and this part was made in China but it seems to be working. It was less than half price of the motorcraft. I think it's ok to get the cheap part for this sensor but not other parts. I kept the old one which was still working just in case (the mechanic I had did not follow my instructions to only replace it if needed). It fit and works to that's good.
2,I'd recommend 'Ride This Train' instead.,"If you're thinking of investing in your first Cash concept album, i'd recommend Ride This Train (1960). Try that, see if you like it. I loved Ride This Train, but wasn't as impressed by America, and sort of regretted paying retail for it. Like most of the Cash concept albums, its well under thirty minutes total, and each of the songs are slight two-minute affairs, the rest being made up by the between-song narration. In Ride This Train, the narration is backed by the sound of a train, which works quite well. On America, Cash just narrates in silence, and it doesn't work as well. I think Ride This Train has better songs, too. Preview 'Loading Coal,' opening track of Ride This Train, with its crisp production and assured vocal, and see for yourself."
5,songs about our nation,"Johnny Cash probably recorded these songs and narrations connected with the Bicentennial back in the 1970s. A great collection which did and ought today again give the listener some pause for thought and reflection. In the 1960s Cash did record, as did others, some songs that really did make a difference in America. He was an original. This album shows why for some of us he remains larger than life and why we thought that recent movie on his life omitted much that could have been told, things very much to his credit.His narration ""Ragged Old Flag"" is one of the most stirring patriotic recordings ever made."
2,Could (and should) have been a lot better,"Kudos to the producers/director for concept: sci-fi/alien invasion/X-Files plot line with ""late night"" lovelies, especially Kira Reed (a favorite from several of the Eros titles). Unfortunately, the execution of the concept falls short. The sex scenes have most of the ""steam"" edited out of them, leaving what amounts to an extended striptease but not much else. The production values are sub-par too, particularly the lighting and sound: the former is generally too garish, the latter too muddy. The net result is disappointment, because it could and should have been a better film."
2,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY","I bought this film and I was dissapointed. I mean, yes, the women are beautiful, but the film itself is a dud. I'd like to say this is a good R rated movie, but I can't; while the sex scenes aren't much beyond an R movie, the storyline sucks. Don't get me wrong, I think this movie has a lot of potential; an alien fungus that takes the form of women, (I'm glad they didn't have it attack men, because I don't want to see that) but that's where the good idea stops. This sex crazed alien starts having less than belivable sex with many men it goes by.I think it should have more (and better) girl girl sex than the one feeling/rubbing scene it has.I think the title of the review is the best way to put it."
2,"Sometimes sexy, but not enough.","Alien Files has the rampant nudity you would look for in a soft-core porn, but shows little actual sex in it. Though I must say that it's great to say Gabriella Hall as a sex addict. Plus, the blonde guard who gets infected is very hot!"
1,Don't Order This Version!,"Don't make my mistake of ordering this version. The cover does not say whether it's R-rated or unrated, but it must have been heavily edited to take out all the good parts. I saw nothing but the back of the girls or quick, fuzzy glimpses of the front. Very frustrating & non-erotic. No comparison whatsoever to Femalien, Virtual Encounters, or Lolida 2000. Why would Amazon or MTI studio even want to sell this version thru internet is beyond me since it only hurts the sale & marketing of the unrated version. In any case, I'm glad I only paid $9.99 for it, but plan to ship it back to Amazon & ask for replacement in the unrated version. (By the way, the plots are silly & the acting is mechanical, but that's not what I'm complaining about.)"
2,kx Fl 511 Panasonic Fax drum unit and cartridge,"PANKXFA84 KX-FL511/541 High Yield Replacement Drum Cartridge, BlackI have no idea how well the cartridge worked, because after I forked out $100 for it, plus another $30 or so for the cartridge, my Panasonic fax machine, which never really worked all that well during the two years I owned it, stopped working. I'd say if your Panasonic needs a new drum unit, you might be better off saving your money because it's half the cost of a new fax. I bought a Brother Intellifax 4100e for about $300, and I'm very happy with it. Happier than I ever was with that Panasonic."
4,Does not include toner,"Unfortunately I misunderstood this product. It may be good for 5000 copies, but it does not include a supersized toner cartridge (or any toner for that matter). The manufacturer's recommendation is that the drum unit be changed when replacing the toner cartridge for the 4th time. While I did not install the Drum unit, it does look well packaged and I have no doubt that when the time comes for changing the drum, the life of the fax machine will be extended. The good thing about Amazon is that returns are possible even when it is the buyers fault. If returning it, I recommend using the economical Amazon UPS return offer instead of the Post Office for this product."
5,GOOD PRICE FOR PRODUCT,I NEEDED A DRUM UNIT FOR MY FAX MACHINE AND FOUND IT ON AMAZON.COM AT A VERY GOOD PRICE.
4,president,Product arrived promply and as advertised. Purchased item as a backup and have not used it yet
1,Don&#65533;t bother.,Too many shots of stain glassed windows and paintings. The majority of the script is spent on telling the gospel rather than explaining the sites. The voices of the heavily reverbed actors are only outdone by the painfully bad synthesizer score. This is VERY poorly produced which is unfortunate. I love documentaries on the holy land. National Geographic's tape on Jerusalem is infinitely better.
4,An antology,"The book peeks into both important and obscure traditions to extract texts that should expose their basic tenets. Covered traditions span from Theravada, Pure Land traditions, various form of Mahayana and Tantra, with some explicit sexual imagery that might not be totally appropriate for young people or members of a monastic community."
3,Gene Kelly Collection - replaced,"The first set of DVD's received, were not in cases and the DVD's were damaged and would not play. Replacement order was executed immediately, and the replacements were ok."
