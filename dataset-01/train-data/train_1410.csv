4,May I vent?,"No doubt the movie is a gem, but what a dissappointing DVD. Given all the hub-bub, I expected some better support material with the movie. For instance, the hour documentary Reconstructing Evil, in which the movie's stars and Welles' admirers explain in detail the director's techniques and his desired changes for this film. This, plus the 58-page memo and perhaps a commentary by a film historian would have made this something special."
4,Not Quite Restored to Welles' Vision,"I have two big gripes about this release:1) The widescreen matting removed way too much of the original frame compositions - compare this with the fullscreen VHS version and you will see.2) Schmidlin/Murch somehow managed not to follow Welles' 58-page memo to the extent they could have - they cut between the scenes of Vargas at the explosion and Susan visiting Grande at different spots than Welles requested, and left in some other shots later in the film that Welles wanted removed. Read the memo, compare it to the Schmidlin/Murch cut, and you will see.In general, the print looks pretty fuzzy. I guess we're stuck with it though.Actually, Schmidlin didn't even have to make most of the changes Welles requested. Universal did, back in 1958. They didn't release that version (they cut it down a lot more for whatever reason) but they did make the changes.Study that memo sometime."
2,A Touch of Evil,This movie was OK. It was not what I had expected from heavy hitters like Charleston Heston and Orson Wells.
2,Unpleasant,"I don't know why I don't like the film Touch of Evil. I should like the film with a very good cast including Orson Welles and Charlton Heston. It's regarded as classic film noir. But there's an unidentifiable unpleasantness about the film. At my age and with my sensibilities, I don't need to be watching films that strike me as unpleasant. I'd much rather watch North By Northwest, which was made at about the same time as Touch of Evil."
5,Welles rises from the dead,"This film was originally another case of Welles making a good film and having it taken away by the studio, recut and made worse. Its amazing that it still had a good reputation, despite having a few scenes that made little sense and were laughable. The studio granted Welles a screening of the recut film. He immediately dictated a 50 page letter to the studio politely asking for changes (that they never made). The DVD has the original letter and reading it is remarkable. The man saw the final cut once and remembered the whole thing frame by frame, and articulately explained why it should be cut differently. Based on the detailed instructions, the film was recut and this DVD relects the results - a good film made great. One of the finest Noir films ever!"
1,"Too bad, I was about to buy it","It seems clear from the customer reviews below that this DVD is a disaster of ""simulated"" letterbox. Apparently the VHS widescreen version is all right, but then of course that's videotape.Now off to Blockbuster, where I will as usual use my magnifying glass to make sure whatever DVD I choose is not panned and scanned. Eternal vigilence, eh? Is there really anyone left renting DVDs whose TV set is too small for letterbox?"
3,Another cult film,"This film kind of drags alittle, but certain segments show Welles's directiing ability. The murder segment in the hotel is a classic.The screen play is kind of weak, but the camera direction is first rate."
3,DVD is a 3-Another Cropped Massacre,"This is another example of a studio taking the lazy road. This brilliant film has been cropped for the DVD version. Isn't it nice how cropping works. It gives the studio a chance to get people to buy the title again if they fix it, which they won't. They'll probably release a Special Edition Version, but it probably won't be fixed. For a good review about this cropping of TOUCH OF EVIL read BERKLEY GUY's review. Me I'm too upset. I am sick of cropped DVDs. I'm sick of version after version. It is all a scam and we buy into it every time. I guess Criterion really is the only company that should be doing DVDs."
2,A great Movie?,"Two star for the story, I thought that it was quite interesting, but all these good actors acting SOOOO BADLY.Orson wells was like a cartoon character, Charlton Heston a mexican? Por favor! and the rest of the actors all look like a joke.Marlene Dietrich looked ridiculous.When you are watching a good movie you ""get into it"" and forget that you are looking at a screen, but in this case I knew at all times that I was watching a bunch of people ""acting"" and quite badly in spite of theirmovie and stage pedigrees."
2,A touch of laughter?,"Two stars for the story that's somehow interesting, the rest is rather laughable.The great Orson Wells looks like a cartoon character, Marlene Dietrich looks simply ridiculous and Charlton Heston a mexican? POR FAVOR!!The rest of the cast are like a joke,the Mexican villains are simply offensive.What a waste of a good cast."
1,You can't go back,You can't go back... Last time I watched this movie was when it first came out in the late 50s. At the time I thought it was marvelous! We really looked forward to going back in time and seeing it again. What a total waste of time. I guess this is proof that you can't go back. Orson Welles was a slobbering moron who needs a drewl cup. Charlton Heston just sort of floats through and does not even try to act. The rest of the cast could be from another planet for all I know. Save your money and buy something good like Unbreakable with Bruce Willis!
1,Butchered,"Any claim that this is the correct aspect ratio is idiotic. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the black bars are covering up the upper portion of the spinning Universal globe. That is valid proof right there.And anyone with half an eye for photography can instantly see that actors' heads are cut off, lots of interesting eye candy is gone, and the entire presentation feels claustrophobic. Orson Welles would've PUKED if he'd seen what they did to his film.BEWARE...a LOT of folks are butchering films this way, and the result is always the same: heads chopped off, close-ups with the eyes or lower part of the mouth covered up, etc.Pathetic."
4,Not the Definitive DVD Release,"The aspect ratio is wrong.Now, I'm not one of these folks who just wants the picture to ""fill"" my screen, but I do want to see the film as it was originally shot and intended, particularly when dealing with an Orson Welles project! This release is NOT as it was originally intended. Letterbox is not appropriate here, and I can only conclude that portions of the picture are missing (?). I sincerely hope that this problem is corrected in future releases, if there are to be future releases."
1,Beware Fake Widescreen,"Well, once again, Welles' artistic vision has been compromised. Apparently a common practice (SO BEWARE), the makers of this DVD have added fake-widescreen...adding black bars across the top and bottom, thus giving the impression of a wider aspect ratio, when in fact the film was never intended to be ""widescreen."" In other words, you are being robbed of the upper and lower portions of the picture. Would Orson have approved? NO! Neither should we!"
2,they buggered a classic film,"For some reason, the jerks who made this DVD decided to change the movie, editing and deleting scenes, deleting/changing music, all according to some notes of Orson Welles'. Well, one of the greatest films now conforms to Orson Welles' alleged desires.This film was great for the past forty-something years because it was great, not because Orson Welles made it, and to change it now in the way they have does it a great disservice. I can't sit through it now.Now the Touch of Evil I love only exists on video tape, and that's a shame."
3,Substandard Work for an excellent film-maker.,"While Orson Welles may be viewed as one of the greats in cinema's history, Touch of Evil (restored or not) does not come up to par. This can be paralleled with Welles own physical appearance in the movie, as he is bloated and glib. Citizen Kane, for example, was a visual masterpiece. Showcasing the young directors talents and daring. But TOE lacks the youthful exuberance of his earlier work. Yes, the opening shot is fantastic. Notice where the focus of your eyes is, and how Welles magicly guides it across the screen. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie slides downhill. The characters and script are dry, not able to keep your interest throughout the entire film. Welles is not god. It is ok to say that some of his movies are not divine pieces of work."
3,So what?,"I just didn't give a damn about any of the characters, not even the opening sequence that lasts three long minutes.This flick does contain some terrifically-directed scenes, as well as some scenes that lack credibility.Dennis Weaver's turn as a motel night clerk is a joke; there is also a scene, very crucial one plot-wise that transpires in Janet Leigh's hotel room--that she manages to sleep through. Give me a break--and I don't care how tired and sleepy she was supposed to be.The DP did a fine job here, and even Wells' spot-on performance as a corrupt detective in this U.S./Mexican border town isn't enough to make you care.Yes, Marlene Dietrich's final words at the end leave an impression...still, it isn't enough."
4,That story...,"Well watching for the narrative it was very confusing. It could have been it was late at night or that I watched this movie as a homework assiment but I tried to follow it as best I could. Had to rewind once or twice to understand better. On the other hand the cinamtic work was way way way ahead its time! A lot of crazy cool close ups. Just when the camera would pan across different scenes I felt like it was a movie that was shot in black and white with terrible audio that was made today! I would not give this movie a perfect score but if just based on cinematic work oh man does it deserve a ""I Love it!"" Score!"
2,Bar? None!,"Universal restored this movie well. However, the studio stupidly released it in widescreen format on DVD. Welles' full-screen ONLY flick now has black bars lopping off maybe the top and bottom fourths of the picture, ruining his original composition and eliminating important details (such as the shoebox Quinlan's partner carries when leaving the Mexican youth's house). If you want to see the flick in its original format, buy the videotape."
4,A landmark film that's showing its age,"""Touch of Evil"" is one of those movies that you always hear about in film classes, but may have never actually seen. This crisp, re-edited version gives you a good idea of why it is considered a classic; some say it's Welles' best movie. The movie holds your attention, but fails to create edge-of-your-seat tension most of the time, as it moves slowly by today's standards and the plot seems contrived.Part of the fun watching it today is seeing various actors in their younger days. Charlton Heston does a fine job as Vargas, squaring off with an elephantine Orson Welles in a world of deep shadows and hidden motives. Janet Leigh is lovely as Vargas' American wife. And try to spot Dennis Weaver in a role where he hides in plain sight!Definitely worth watching. If you're a real movie buff, you might even watch it more than once, to catch all the nuances."
5,One good firearm!!!,"This is a good pellet firearm. The reason I say firearm that even though it doesn't have powder to fire the ammo is that it can fire a pellet up to 450 yards. That is 1,250 feet. I like that it is metal. It even has a working hammer in the back. I owned the daisy 15xt and it was plactic and the hammer was just for looks and didn't work. Also, the co2 screw stuck out. This co2 holder doesn't show and it takes clips for the ammo instead of just sliding the bbs in like in the daisy 15xt. This has wood grips and fires in single mode which you pull down the hammer and double mode where you just fire it. I can't say any bad things about this gun except you might have to keep it lubed up since it is metal. Buy it. I know it is expensive but it is worth it!"
4,Delightfully Funny Collection of Short Stories about a Bumbling Professor,"I read this years and years ago. When I lost my copy, I tracked it down again and replaced it.C. P. Ransom is a college science professor whose bumbling attempts to create scientific breakthroughs might well have been the basis for many a Disney movie.Each short story is complete and self-contained. Read slowly to make the stories last."
4,Great buy and covers allot of sins on the Front Seats,Easy to install and very good fit. Also easier to move around on than the OEM fabric. Looks and feels plenty durable.
5,My number one favorite,"I have been wearing exclamation for 10 years. It is my number one favorite and it always will be. I buy 5-6 bottles at a time, I never want to run out. I love when people tell me they think of me when they smell exclamation. There is four relatives who told me they loved what I was wearing, I bought each of them a bottle and all four gave them back to me. They said it didn't smell as good on them as it does on me. Thank you so much Coty!"
5,Thankful for the help,"After not being able to find my cologne in stores, it was nice to find a place I can still get it. Waiting a week isn't to exciting, but a $12 difference is nice:)"
3,The origanal's all ways the best.,"This book is in the form of cine-manga when a tv show gets made into a comic book, so it's like photos of the anime in the book add with little speech bubbles. What I don't like though is that in this style it doesn't really look like the words are coming from the charaters mouth and the storys get shortend up and doesn't have all the anime in it. So what I say is buy the manga get the anime but don't buy the cine-manga, it isn't worth it.~*~Purin~*~"
4,A good entertaining read,"To beat the Americans in the development of the atomic bomb, a group of high-ranking Nazi officers conceive and execute a plot to kidnap Albert Einstein.This book kept me very well entertained last Friday night. The author combines good characters and readable writing style to create a solid World War II espionage thriller.Fans of Alistair MacLean's World War II novels might enjoy this book."
1,LOL... WHAT?,"I was all set to click on ""Add to Cart"" for this book, as a recent buyer of an S2000. Then I glanced at the price. I thought it was a misplaced decimal point or something. Sorry. I'm from the Midwest, so my red-state brain doesn't wrap neatly around the idea of blowing $282 for a book about a car."
1,Say WHAT??,"Am I imagining things, or does this book realy warrant pricing from $123 to $800?? I am an S2000 owner, not a Ferrari guy. Those dudes will easily pay any amount for trinkets like this volume. Seriously, tell me you didn't pay over a hundred bucks for one of these. Please."
5,Le Corsaire,"It was absolutely wonderful. It's such a pleasure to enjoy real ballet in American through this historical production of the famous ballet.I recommend this to all ballet fans, and to all who wish to expand their culture knowledge.Meg"
4,about the quality of the image,"The worst thing about this DVD is that it's in letterbox format (4:3).The quality of the video is pretty good. It should look pretty good on a conventional TV, but it's okay even with a HD TV.The quality of the dancing is quite good as well.It's not the most recent production, so people who know ballet may feel that the costumes, lighting, and the set are not the most up to date style. But this would be a good DVD to keep in your ballet DVD collection.But I still like the ABT version of Le Corsaire better."
5,impressed,"I ordered this letter stamping set on Dec 15th, this was shipped direct from the Mfg and arrived on my door step on Dec 18th. Great service/wonderful product. Since I am using these for jewelry making I was pleasantly surprised this was 3 sets not 2 that I thought I read in the description as the picture was very hard to see. I will buy from this seller again."
5,Essential Libertarian Reading,"The Structure of Liberty is one of the finest libertarian books on the scene today. More than just another justification of libertarianism, Barnett explores libertarianism's practical implications, showing how the ""liberal conception of justice and the rule of law"" is effective in dealing with a series of problems he presents as facing any legal system. And though you wouldn't know it by reading some of the reviews on this page, Barnett defends a version of libertarian anarchism, devoting an entire to chapter to listing the problems of the monopolistic state (""the single power principle""). This book's other highlights include his superlartive defense of restitution and the short story about the ability of a ""polycentric constitutional order"" to deal with the ""rouge agency"" problem that defenders of libertarian anarchism inevitably encounter. A must-read for all those interested in libertarianism."
4,An Important Contribution to Libertarian Theory,"This book is one of the most important works of libertarian theory since Nozick. And while it shares with that volume a weakness for foundational philosophic issues (Barnett tells us that libertarian rights are good because they promote ""peace, prosperity, and happiness,"" with litte in the way of clarification or elaboration), it is nevertheless an important synthesis of work in economics, legal and political theory, and philosophy. The weaving of Hayekian insights into a coherent libertarianism is incomplete, but far better than anything else produced thus far. And the case for anarcho-capitalism (a polycentric legal order) is intriguing, if not entirely novel. A worthwhile book."
4,Pretty cool videos,"Some of these videos are cool right through. Some are cool at parts. Ex. Symphony of Destruction has a cool part when the band is shown and some other scenes too. Go to Hell is brilliant right through, scary and weird. The best thing about the go to hell video is when they have edited so that you can see what all of the instruments are playing at once. This is a pretty short video, and it[is too bad] that it is only avalible in America. However, besides all original videos you get to see some live videos. Cool, even if it had been cool to hear someone from the band present each video or to throw in some extras. Hope this will come on DVD soon."
1,Perfect waste of quality plastic.....,"I'm sure that purchasers will find some alternative uses for this CD. Among the suggestions I have are:High Tech CoasterIridescent Clay PigeonTemplate for drawing fixed circleslo-tech FrisbeeChew toy for attack dogsAfter listening to the songs downloaded from Napster (the fiends who are putting poor misunderstood Metallica in the poor house) I find that it has almost no aesthetic value. The producer should find a new line of work, perhaps in rap music or as a street musician.If the bands on this CD got 300 percent better they would still not even make an opening act for Insane Clown Posse who in my opinion is a much better band.Hope this helps."
5,Stop Censorship,"An effort is underway to ban this CD from record stores. Better buy it quick. People acting on behalf of the victims of this horrendous crime are using bias and misinformation to scare record stores into banning the CD. Christy (the other reviewer) is from my hometown. While this crime is gruesome, I disagree that we should stop hearing about it. I urge everyone interested in this case to read all sides of the evidence, testimony and police reports before making up their minds. If you do not want to buy it, that is your CHOICE. As far as proceeds from the CD....they are going into a fund that will provide college money for the convicted when AND only WHEN their verdicts are overturned. NO MONEY FROM THE SALE OF THIS CD IS FOR LEGAL FUNDS TO FREE THE CONVICTED."
3,The Purpose,"I haven't bought the CD, but I've listened to a few tracks and I'm intrigued by the purpose of it. Christy, the other reviewer, sounds a bit biased in her review since she doesn't agree with the purpose of it--trying to give 3 possibly innocent men another chance at being proven guilty before being put to death. The music sounds very charged and powerful in its lyrics, probably due to the strong beliefs of the artists involved, and most of the artists aren't very well-known, at least by me in my limited knowledge."
1,You have got to be kidding !!!,"I feel that Mr. Cost is in his own private fantasy world when it comes to women. I think I spent most of the time reading this book in gag reflex mode. How dare he try to put women in a nutshell for men's pleasure? ""Keep your voice soft?, Keep your hair long!, anal sex, if he wants it, let him? I did not find anywhere anything about what a women would feel in response to Mr. Cost's suggestions on pleasing (actually being a slave) a man. He only commented on how to give ourselves totally without question, as long as the man was happy. I really do feel sorry for any of Mr. Cost's women, for they are either stupid to realize the role he has planned for them, or they have no girlfriends to help them see through his crap. Hopefully this will be Mr. Cost's last book, we really don't need anymore caveman comments.Millicent A Smith"
4,just stop and think,"As a women i enjoyed this book and was upset to see the reviews from other women, while some of the things may be a little far fetched 70 percent of it is, I think, very necessary in dealing with men(some was just an opinion) however he has probably spoken with far more men from different parts of the world(far more men than I know) and if he sayd that MOST men feel this way, I have to atleast consider it. My friends and I had already been saying a lot of things that were in the book and this only comfirmed it. I read the book as a joke but for most women-think about it you probably read it b/c you don't have a man and/or CAN'T KEEP A MAN therefore maybe you should take some of the advice and understand your place as a women in a mans life...I agreed and enjoyed the book"
5,LOVE IT!!!,I bought this CD after her 2nd one came out. I absolutely LOVE both CD's and will be buying her new one soon. There wasn't one song on either of the first 2 CD's that I didn't like.
5,Great album,The song One Day alone would make this a great album. But there are many great songs as others have mentioned. I've been playing One Day all day long on repeat. Very easy on the ears. Great bass opening. Nice guitar work. Great vocals!
4,A Good But Somewhat Dated Introduction,"This is a very good book in the Dorling Kindersley style, lots of details, sidebars, photos and facts. In 2-3 page sections, the book covers ski jumping, skiing, downhill racing, the slalom, freestyle, cross-country, and other snow sports (e.g., very brief mentions of dog-sled racing, the luge, bobsledding). Although too brief, and by now, quite outdated, it's a good short introduction to snow sports. Includes a glossary and an index, and lots of photos in its 32 pages."
1,Horrible Meter,"Get any other meter but the True Track if you can help it. The True Track is the cheapest, and it is probably OK for someone who does not need consistently accurate results, but if you are pregnant or need to have tight blood glucose control you should get something better. I work with pregnant women and some of them had insurance that would not cover any other meter except True Track. We often compared them to other meters. The True Track meters usually (but not always) read 10-20% higher than the other meters, and occasionally read 30-40% higher. Occasionally they agreed with the other meters, but not nearly often enough!"
1,Agree other others VERY VERY inconsistent,"I also got this meeter and had very inconsistent results. Like others, I tested on different fingers, different hands, and sometimes by numbers would be 500 and 100 within one minute. That is the difference between life and death! Definitely would suggest a different meter."
1,DANGEROUS TO RELY ON,"DO NOT ADJUST YOUR INSULIN DOSAGE BASED ON RESULTS FROM TRUETRACK!My husband recently started glucose testing to judge his insulin dosage. With this machine his blood readings were well over what they should be so he kept increasing his insulin.He was becoming shaky so eventually tried my Prestige (which has been discontinued but still gives me accurate readings based on my bloodwork)and there was over 100 points difference!Then I compared my Prestige reading with Truetrack and Truetrack was over 60 points higher. We were on a roll and decided to try a third system, so ordered TrueResuts. Those readings matched the Prestige. We then compared both monitors with Truetrack (obviously we've gone through a lot of test strips and our fingers are sore!!).Our amateur research confirmed that Truetrack was testing extremely high - it was 100 points higher than both Prestive and TrueResults. At least this scared him into eating better!"
5,"Great, inexpensive, accurate meter","I read those negative reviews and I am VERY grateful that I have used this TRUEtrack meter (actually I have had 3 of these so far) previous to reading them.This is a VERY accurate meter and the test strips are unbelievably inexpensive.By far the best and least expensive meter and test strips that I have used.After reading those negative reviews, I just scratch my head and cannot figure out what they are even talking about.NOT this meter for sure!"
1,Do not buy this!,I have this testing machine. It worked well with the first ten strips it came with. Then I spent $$$ on additional strips & it never worked again. Save your money and buy something else!
4,Great Start,"As an early talkie, this film is filled with random musical numbers. The spontaneity of them works, since the Marx Brothers are so outrageous themselves and because they started out in vaudeville, but the quality isn't great. Thankfully, they were written by Irving Berlin.The story is just as unimportant as the music. Groucho owns some land in Florida that he wants to get rid of; it just happens to have a hotel running on it. On it, there is romance and thievery. Kay Francis takes part in robbing Margaret Dumont of her jewels while Groucho attempts to romance them for their money. Harpo and Chico run amuck causing hilarious moments and antagonizing everyone in their path. One of the best choreographed scenes is the ""door scene"" where general madness ensues. It's been copied many times in both film and on stage in shows like ""Lend Me a Tenor."" Zeppo appears too, but his part is very minor."
4,Cocoanuts-Funny if a little stagy,"Classic is the viaduct scene(one of the first of many film exchanges between Groucho and Chico that was to become standard Marx Bros. fare.), and Groucho responds to Zeppo when Zeppo asks who the telegram is from(""Western Union, and they've got a lot of money!"").Film has funny moments, but is quite stagy, which maybe is expected for this early talkie. Followed by Animal Crackers(which is better)."
3,"Slow, early Marx, but a solid start!","This is a film that is good to watch if you like slow-paced movies. The plot does take a while to get established, and then after the apparent climax at the auction, the film slowly drags to a conclusion. In their next two films, ""Animal Crackers"" and ""Monkey Business"" there is a similar trend of building up to a climax and coasting to the end. In ""Animal Crackers"", the film slowed after the painting was stolen, and in ""Monkey Business"" once the brothers snuck off the boat the pace also slowed down. However in this movie the Marxes demonstrate their potential for their future films. Groucho is at his best as he always is, spouting off quick one-liners whenever necessary, and Chico and Harpo are slowly coming into character themselves. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable film and a great piece of movie history."
3,A Vote for Silliness,"There are some terrific reviews here, almost all have a lot to say that will help anyone enjoy (or at least understand) this movie better. However, to my mind, the one element of this flick that makes it so special is its capacity for silliness--something that we in our self conscious age have almost lost as a concept. The Bro's ability to apparently TRULY NOT CARE about how those around them will react to their zaniness--like a child at its best--is disbturbing (while its amusing) because it holds up to us what we have lost while growing up. See it and set yourself free."
3,Marx Classic- Poor Transfer,"The Cocoanauts is a wonderfully funny movie. The classic sketches (ie. The Viaduct) are as funny now as they were then. While parts are dated and may seem corny this only adds to the movies charm. This was almost 70 years ago when talkies were new and vaudville show and dance reigned. I removed two stars because of the shabby transfer to DVD. Much more could have been done in terms of sound and video quality. While some ultra- purists may disagree, I feel that we have a responsibilty to save these movies not show the shabby way Hollywood studios have treated them. I am not arguing for a Turneresque colorization or Dolby remaster. I would have appreciated a cleaner more inteligiable copy. Otherwise this is a 5 all the way!!"
3,Bought it for a friend...,"Don't know anything about it, all I know is he had trouble finding it, and this vendor had it for cheap...it worked out well."
2,The Cocoanuts,"The DVD doesn't work in Australia; notation on screen says ""wrong region"" or some such."
4,Why Doesn't Groucho have top billing,"I have to say this is a great movie, who whouldn`t like to see Harpo pickpocket his own brother. Great script great gags and an all around good movie"
3,A Pity,This could have been a much better film. It should only be seen if you are a true Marx Bro fan. There is minimal humor in this film. The audio and video quality of this film is terrible even so.
5,A great first novel!,"Strong, well-defined characters that I really got to know, added to an easy-going but very realistic plot line, mixed up with a bunch of New Mexico ""in jokes"" (all of which are explained in the book, so nobody needs to feel left out) makes a recipe for a terrific read. Authentic ""doc talk"" makes it ring true, and there are no red herrings and, rarest of all among most contemporary authors, no ""magic"" ending where everything resolves for no apparent reason. I HOPE this is the first of a series of novels about Matt Dorgan and the gente of Mogote, New Mexico. I want to get to know 'em better."
1,9 days late,"Package was sent on the 13 of august as of the 25 of august package still shows it is located in jamaica,ny package was suppose to arrive on the 16"
1,Do not buy this item,"This is the worst telephone I have ever owned. It's so difficult to hear the person you are talking with. I find myself having to ask the other person to repeat themselves many times during each conversation I have while using this phone. You hear background noise louder than it actually is (say your television is on, but at a reasonable volume level, it will sound louder than it is through this phone, making it nearly impossible for you to hear the person you're speaking to). I actually dread phonecalls now. I am looking for a different phone today. Talking on the phone should not be frustrating! Do not buy this phone set."
5,Better Sleep,"My doctor recommended that I commit to taking Melatonin for 30 days straight. When I had tried it before I only gave it a few days before deciding it just didn't work. I have terrible insomnia. With another product I saw some improvement after my 30 day commitment, but with this one I saw even better improvement in my sleep. I will continue to use this on a daily basis."
3,"Nice looking, but clunky","I purchased these sunglasses after seeing them in James Bond. Sure, they're cool looking but they are large and somewhat clunky. Buying sunglasses online is not a good idea, as it's best to try them on in person."
2,Noisy,"I can't get these brake pads to stop squeaking, I've changed the shims twice and even tried the silicone adhesive and they still squeak."
4,Hard to Find Club Hits - the REAL ONES,"Anyone who went to dance clubs in the mid-to-late eighties probably discovered a lot of music at that time. Some of the popular dance club hits made their way into the charts, while others became hard to find... even to this day. This collection features some of those very hard to find club favorites. You're sure to be transported back in time when you hear them. They vary from new wave to house to early techno. Some are great, while others are not that amazing, but the great ones are well worth the price of the CD. Look for the other volumes in this series, too! There are too many fake ""club hits"" compilations out there that just try to sell you stupid radio top 40 crap and call it club hits. Notice, if you heard some of the classic club songs in the film Gross Point Blank, the idiots who handled the soundtrack CD didn't include ANY of the rarer songs on that one, so don't even bother with it. This is more like what you want."
4,A good book,"The reason I like it is I like exciting stories and the description sounded exciting. Unfortunately, it wasn't as exciting as I thought but it still was pretty exciting.A character, called Dawn, stole something of the main character's, Emily's unicorn. Without it, she can't run fast.Emily knew right away that Dawn had stolen it. She didn't have to find out. I think it would've been more exciting if she had looked for clues or something because then it would be more like a mystery and she would suspect other people in the story and I would be trying to solve it.I hope you like it.From an 8 year old."
3,Fish Face,"This book is fiction. It is in a school during the school day. A new student is unhappy and stole Emily's uni. Emily came into class late from recess, because she was saving a worm. Her lucky piece uni was gone. She felt that Dawn took it. Dawn said that Emily looked like a fish. Emily dropped all her books and had to sit in the hall. Beast was cheing gum and had to sit in the hallway by Emily. I liked the surprise birthday party. I did not like that Emily was always in trouble."
1,Zen Poems,"I had purchased my first copy some time ago, and thnk it excellentThese two recent purchases are giftsto people with problems.."
2,Cheap & missing hardware - just make your own,"I should have just gone to the hardware store and made my own dog trolley. I purchased this one trying to save a few dollars. I ended up spending even more money replacing the included cheap hardware. The pulley is made of plastic which is fine if your dog is 100 years old and so blind he won't notice the squirrels taunting him just out of reach. The spring is a joke. I replaced mine with a new one called a ""porch swing spring"". Two washers and two cable clamps were missing. A lead was included with mine but now I have two because I ordered one expecting it not to be included as other reviewers stated. Oh well, lesson learned, you get what you pay for. For anyone considering a dog trolley I'd advise you to pick up everything you need at a hardware store. A good pair of pliers and a drill is about all you need to make and install one of these things yourself. ***Also please save your dog's neck by use a harness when attaching your pup to one of these.***"
1,Nascar Tackle Box Display 6/Dale Jr 6/Jeff Gordon,If you look on the Web you can find this same item for $5.99 and a picture of it. Don't buy from this one it is a HUGE rip-off. There is a reason they don't show the picture.
5,The Most Beautiful Beatles!,"It was almost a decade since I heard this CD. I got so impressed to hear this!""Lady Madonna"", ""Black Bird"", ""Back in the USSR"", and other great Lennon=McCartney's 19 numbers are reborn. The King's singers give them new power. They are totally corpolated and harmonious. This could be my greatest CD ever!"
1,Insult to the Beatles,"I love the Beatles. Imagine the shock and horror I experienced Christmas morning 2009 when my wife's parents ""blessed"" out family with this CD. At first I thought it was a new Beatles ""best of"" collection. My wife opened it, and began to play it on our stereo. Just about 30 seconds into the first song I turned green, and felt ill.It takes a special kind of person to enjoy this CD. As for me, NO THANKS!"
4,Previously Unreleased Elton John Song,"This cd is okay for European flavored compilation, but it is a must for Elton John collectors or fans, because of the EJ track, ""Red"". ""Red"" was never released on any other compilation or lp, other than this, and is an awesome EJ outtake from the ""Made in England"" sessions from 1995. There is also a track from Middle Eastern performer, Khaled, called ""Maardi"", that is beautiful with contemporary Middle Eastern pop sound. Pleasant listening overall."
5,BrAtZ RoCk,"Ok, everyone who likes Jade, or even any other bratz doll, will love this doll.She comes with loads of funky 60's items including a bube tube(with tie, Black trousers, 60's hat, white dress, fishnet tights, white boots and black sandals, green coat (looks better out of box, earrings and much more.(...) i love this toy, it is perfect for anyone from 5+.Girls get this toyParents, be prepared for it on their wishlist!!!Thankyou for reading."
5,I love this doll,I totally love this doll. I wish that my mom will let me have her but she says that they are too expensive. And for all of you who says that she is ugly f*ck you. And shut up parents I mean like they're just dolls so get over it.
3,Not near as good as i expected,"I am almost 13 years old and love to collect everything Bratz. I saw this doll and imediatly wanted it, because i absolutly LOVE all things retro. I was somewhat disapointed with what i recived. I loved everything about this doll at first, they clothes, hair, make up ect. And then, about a month after i got her, her beautiful lips (that USED to be light pink) turned into an ugly yellow color. Her beautiful, silky black hair literally turned into a ""rats"" nest. I was extremly disapointed. For $30 [in Canada] i would have expected MUCH better quality. I was able to fix Jade's make up, a bit. But it still isn't as good as it ""used"" to be. If you are a collector, and you keep your doll(s) in the box(es), then this is totally for you, but if you plan on taking her out of the box and handling her, that i suggest you buy another doll. This is good though, but not HALF as good as i thought it would be."
1,EEEEEWWWWW,"Jade is my favorite Bratz character,but what happend to her here?If you want to know who is the ugliest Jade ever made.It`s Live in Concert Jade.All of her is blue.Her lipstick,her hair,her clothes.....By the way,I don`t like this Jade.I don`t like her lipstick either.SARA SIBLINI!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*1/2 PART MY SCENE LOVER,1/2 MY SCENE HATER"
1,We need a balance,"We are in a new, changing world. Give us support to help us navigate in this new world, not admonitions that don't take into account the realities of our times."
1,"More working-mom-bashing, ad nauseatum...","This book is oh, so retro...blaming working mothers and romanticizing the mom who sacrifices her career & interests to coddle her ""fragile"" kids 24/7. It's basically the same trite backlash junk that circulated in the 80's that if you work, you can't love your kids. Get real, Brenda, it's the 90's!"
3,a bit cheap,"So I should've known that the price dictates quality. The watch is a nice style and fits well on my petite wrist. But the watch fills with condensation while in the bathroom with the shower on. This started a couple of weeks after I got it. It hasn't affected the accuracy of the timekeeping, but it takes a few hours for it to dissipate."
5,Her Best,Petula was released in 1968 and reached #51 US Billboard 200 Album chart. Petula had two singles to reach the chart. They are: Kiss Me Goodbye #15 US Billboard Singles Chart and Don't Give Up #37 US Billboard Singles Chart. Her voice work is beautiful in this collection of songs; whether they are sad (Why Can't I Cry?) or happy (Your Love Is Everywhere). She seems to have found herself in Petula. Gone are the cover songs. I just love this album. To me is is an AAAAA+++++. Below are a list of songs on the album.Side OneDon't Give UpHave Another Dream On MeYour Love Is EverywhereOne In A MillionBeautiful In the RainSide TwoKiss Me GoodbyeThe Sun Shines Out of Your ShoesWe're Falling In Love AgainDaysWhy Can't I Cry?The Good Life
4,It's like Carl Hiassen and Chris Buckley collaborated...,"This is the story of the election to fill the congressional seat in a fictitious district. The seat becomes available when its occupant, Buzzer LeBrand, falls into a coma. To reveal who runs would ruin some of the early surprise. Once the race is on, it is quite suspenseful. This book will please Hiassen and Buckley fans. The writing is of that caliber. My only lament is it is told from multiple points of view, none of which are particularly empathetic, and it's hard to figure out whom to route for. But if you're not a stickler for classic story structure, this will be of the moment. All in, it is good, its two chief assets being it is funny, and it provides a great fly-on-the-wall view of the election process."
4,"Very simple, inexpensive remote","The Ge Jasrm 24911 remote works well. There are no extra features, but it is very cheap and good for simple TV viewing usage. It sets up easily and has no connection issues. It is on the small side, and it is somewhat easy to lose. It looks like a mid-range remote, not being extremely light and flimsy, but still not super aesthetically pleasing. Good remote if you are looking for basic controls at a low cost."
1,This is heresy.,"This ""Bible"" is a heretical piece of trash. The authors will be held accountable for blaspheme against the SON of Man. You people areignorant, arogant heretics. The only argument that people like y'all use to back this trash up is that the Bible was written by men and that in that time period they were all sexist and therefore wrote the Bible in such a manner as to reflect their sexist views. Wrong. This is where your ignorant. The Bible is Divinely inspired. It was physically penned by men, but the words within it, every single word from ""In"" to ""Amen""; from Genesis to Revelation; every last one of them are the words of God the FATHER Almighty. HE told them what to write. HE authored that Bible. You people have commited blaspheme against the SON of God the FATHER and will burn in Hell if you do not repent and pull this piece of heresy, this tool of left-wing, liberal, feminist propaganda from the shelves. I pray that God brings judgement on you people and your children. NOT mercy."
1,Amazon should introduce negative stars as well to rate items...,"I wouldn't even give one star for this blasphemic title, but I had to - otherwise you would not be able to read this comment. Amazon should introduce negative stars as well. I would give minus five stars then ;-)"
1,What an Abomination!,Is the only reason why they changed the gender of the LORD Jesus Christ political? How grievous!
1,A Warning,"A Warning&#65279;18&#65279; &#65279;&#65279;For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: &#65279;&#65279;If anyone adds to these things, &#65279;&#65279;God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; &#65279;19&#65279; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, &#65279;&#65279;God &#65279;shall take away his part from the &#65279;Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.The New King James Version. 1996, c1982 (electronic ed.) (Re 22:18). Nashville: Thomas Nelson."
1,"In Hebrew ""Judith"" is feminine for ""Judas""","A friend with a Hebrew doctorate noted to me: ""There is no feminine form of the name 'Jesus' (or 'Joshua'). 'Judith' is the feminine form of the name 'Juda' - or 'Judas.'""How perfectly fitting!"
1,Interesting...,"Being a guy who collects books, I picked up this book from a friend of mine who just got it. I wanted to see the hubbub over what this was.First things first: I own a copy of the Jefferson Bible. This book, the supposed next step in this series, goes a far ways from the Jeffersonian tradition...which in itself is steeped heavily in Unitarianism (as that is what Jefferson was).Next: Judith? The name means: ""Woman from Judah"". However, Jesus (if one remembers correctly) was raised in (and is considered from) Gallilee, which is in the north. Talk about a bad step in the wrong direction.Finally: Switching from male to female causes a hell of a lot of translation errors. Trust the greek, it's much more ACCURATE.If 0 stars were available, I would give it. But since there are not...I give it one star with a hole underneath it."
1,Let's just rewrite our history books too!,"What, we write a new Bible to fit with the times?!!?!I don't think so. Now what are they going to do, rewrite history and say George Washington was a woman!?!?!?Good grief, I'm a woman, and I find this book disgusting!I'd give it NEGATIVE 10 rating!!!"
1,What a waste of time,"If this sells, I'm writing a corrected history of the USA featuring all the great founding mothers:Georgia WashingtonBernadet FranklinThomasina JeffersonJoanne JayAlexandra Hamiltonetc..."
1,Point Blank Money Making Effort...,"Come on guys, these people are obviously cuckoo for cocoa puffs and just looking to make a buck. Don't buy this peice of trash, vote with your wallet, and let them all collect dust. They're just trying to attract attention by doing something they all know darn well is as goofy as a $3.00 bill, don't let it get to you.However, if they really want my input may I say suggest they try the same thing with the Qur'an and see what happens next. They'd be the brave ones should they change 'Mohammad' to 'Marylin,' no...?;^)Dave..."
1,G.I. Jane for the spiritually challenged,"I am really surprised that Amazon would put a comedic spoof like this in the religion section. I had to laugh when I read an article about this book being touted as a serious scholarly work, but I suppose humorous fiction can have its serious side.The tragic side of this farce is that people wasted years of their lives trying to figure out ways to bend the truth to serve their own political agendas. My suggestion to the autors and publishers of this thinly veiled political propaganda piece is that they simply go back to the original text and believe what's there. Don't turn a silk purse into a sow's ear and then try to convince us that we are better off with the sow's ear."
1,"wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong","This book is the only book I've ever submitted a review for.Give me a break. It's a HISTORICAL FACT that the man named Jesus of Nazareth was A MAN. Why don't we all just start rewriting history, making everyone a woman so we don't offend anyone.Better yet... let's all rewrite history and claim that everyone is Mexican so as to not offend Mexicans. Or, let's rewrite factual history and make all the ""characters"" midgets, so as to not offend midgets. Or, let's all rewrite factual history, and make all the people parakeets, so we don't offend parakeets.Or, how's this? Rewrite my father's birth certificate (and every government document related to him), to make him a second mother to me, so no freaks get offended at him being a man.I am a Christian. But this book is just wrong. So there is no sin in hoping and wishing that they get justly punished for such blasphemy."
1,Do You Not Fear God???,How could one even want to re-write the Gospels. The most Treasured Holy Book in the history of man. The Living Word of God.Do you not fear God? He who will judge you on the Great Day of the Lord. What will you say on Judgement Day? What will be your answer? What will you say to the Creator of Heaven and Earth as He looks upon you and says....God have mercy on you and the publishers who thought this was a good idea.Stars----0 a big Fat Zero!
1,Garbage,"This book is GARBAGE. Plain and simple. LBI must have bee paid a heavy fee to publish this. The other books that they have published have been very highly regarded Business, Legal and Technical books. This is quite a departure for them. I wonder how this particular book came to them?"
1,THIS BOOK IS OUT OF PRINT.,This web page is out of date. This web page is out of inventory for this title and can not ship it.
1,Test the spirit...,"Scripture says to test the spirit. Any spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. This book does not make that confession. May the authors and publisher turn back to God, for He is gracious, loving, and longsuffering."
1,A sad day indeed...,"Since the folks at LBI Institute are reading the Bible, I'd like to point out Revelations 22:18-19, since they obviously missed it.Women are the mothers and architects of our future. They perform the most important tasks on the planet. Most of us men are just paying the bills! Why don't you women get that? Since you really have NO IDEA how you came to be, you may want to consider that God, the designer and creator of the physical universe and all that's in it, made you to be as important as you truly are. Why isn't that good enough for you? Why is God's word as put in place by God not good enough for you?"
1,The real author is...,"Pehaps the burden of scholarship was too great to bother rewriting the Old Testament, which refers to Jesus as the ""Son of man"" as far back as the book of Daniel. I think that the reality here is the Satan may be a woman."
1,Judith = Judas,Trash. Pure trash. The bible is very clear on the punishment for those who change the Word of God. I'm standing back out of the way!...........way back out of the way.............
1,I cant believe it !!!!,Pure and simple blasphemy. Had to give one star but would preferred 0 but not available.
1,Disgraceful,"I'd give it negative stars, but that is not an option.Perverse, dispicable, and disgusting. One only has to turn to the true Bible, to see that perversions of this are coming in the last days. I weep for the wicked, but not too much. How much lower can we sink into the cesspool society is currently swimming in. I had to add, it is good to see my fellow brothers and sisters here, made me smile. We know where we are going, but we still have a duty here. Thank you, and God bless."
1,Speaking as a woman. This is Blasphemy!,"Reading the other reviews here, I can't believe that this is being touted as being an advance for women's rights. That is just not true. God sent his only SON, not his daughter. It is also true that God loves all of us, male and female the same. He created each of us as we are. We should not strive to become something we are not. This book truly offends me. I agree with the other reviewer, those that produced this book will be held responsible for those they deceive. I pray for each of them."
1,Judith Christ of Nazareth,These people need there heads examined. It is absolutely fiction. I think it would be a good idea to be praying hard for our children and Grandchildren for this is the work of evil.
3,Review implies that one has viewed material,"Fitting that most of you ""review"" a book you've never read and condemn it based on what you think of the idea. ""The Bible says"" how many of you read biblical Hebrew? I forgot, the Bible was written by God through diving inspiration, then divinely translated into Latin. Then Devinely translated into English I suppose. How many of you know that in the ""Bible"" as it was written in Hebrew the first human contained both male and female, the sum of humanity, and was only called Adam after the split? I guess Mr God changed his mind about that by the time He translated it into English. god, what a kidder."
1,God has already warned them :-,"the last chapter in the book of Revelations states it pretty clearly...""""""18 I warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, 19 and if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. 20 He who testifies to these things says, ""Surely I am coming soon."" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! 21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen. """"""so no matter what anyone thinks... God already has settled the issue... Do I hear an AMEN?God bless you all.... with love, The Knucklehead!"
1,Simply Silliness!,"This publisher wants us to believe that by changing a few letters in a name, he can change a person's sex. Utter silliness!The publisher says ""We published this new Bible to acknowledge the rise of women in society."" I don't think he is being honest here. I just think he wants some attention.What a fitting way to acknowledge the rise of women in society - change the sex of Jesus! Pure silliness! Honestly, I can't believe that he actually expects us to take his translation seriously and view it as a scholarly work. If this shows the state of scholarship in the 21st century, we're in big trouble!"
1,Absolutely Sick! Best Rated as 666!,"There's a curse to authors and readers who buy into this sacrilege. It's eternal damnation!""And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" Rev. 22:19."
1,Filfth,"What garbage. The Bible CLEARLY states the gender of our savior and lord. That a stuck up author would DARE to write a book composed of such trash is a testament to the evils of feminism, and the level of degradation in our society...."
1,Based on what evidence?,There is just as much evidence in the world that Jesus Christ was a woman as there is that Jesus Christ was a hedgehog.
1,Have not received this product yet,"To the best of my knowledge I have not received this book yet, must have gotten lost in the mail or something."
4,Ephesians (Life Application Bible Commentary),Great resource tool to digging deeper in to scripture. it give a in-depth perspective that helps understand the verse more clearly.
2,Not ready for prime time,"I expected more from this book after reading the reviews in Amazon.com. This book was self-published and quite rightly so - no self-respecting publisher would touch it! Target audience seems to be 8th graders and the author has probably reached them. Anyone older will only groan at the juvenile writing style. If anyone edited this book it is not evident, but the author should acknowledge his limitations and seek help! I think the storyline is interesting, but I'll not be wasting my money on any more of this author's efforts."
5,GET IT,This cd is great with a viriety of music styles this also is their newest full cd. The only one of theirs better is mustang....also all their other cds cheeper than amizon. You can buy buzz songs dvd and lilly of da video dvd and vhs.
2,Disappointing Color/Finish,"I received these as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas and was very excited to see that my wife had found these. Schlage makes a great product, and many of our other door levers are from their line. However, I was very disappointed in the color and finish of this product. It is advertised as an Oil Rubbed Bronze finish, and appears to be black in the picture. The actual product is more of a milk chocolate color and looks nothing like the Oil Rubbed Bronze finish I was hoping for. The finish seems painted and is rather cheap looking. I gave this two stars as I see nothing wrong with the functionality of the product, just the color/finish."
4,Need more than one copy,If you plan on using this book for a class it is imperative that you use more than one copy. It is too hard to teach out of using only one. There are too many helpful graphs and charts that the studnets need to have.
5,Blackberry case,"Shipped quick and works great. Makes phone fit snug in belt case but I prefer it that way. It is easy to recognize my phone on the conference room table too, great look and feel."
1,CHEAP IS CHEAP,When trying to get the cover off a 'flap' broke destroying the connect at the corner. Unusable and unfixable.This is a terrible product that should be avoided. Pay $20 for a better one instead.
2,Not exactly what it says!!!,This is a case that is for the Blackberry....it says it is a rubberized hard case..it is very difficult to close and doesn't fit just snug!!!
1,Poor Quality,Absolutely worthless. The clips that hold the two halves together are to thin and if you ever need to get to your battery you will break all the clips trying to get the cover off the phone. Very poor quality. You get what you pay for.
4,Trust - Live,"Trust - Live proves that good rock n roll is universal and language matters not! I haven't a clue what the singer is carping on about but the music is great. Best track/standout tracks - Instinct De Mort, Le Mitard, On Leche, on Lache.... and Antisocial (pronounce that on-tea soshall) Forget about Beethoven and That's Alright Mama. This band kicks in French. This is one of those rare albums that it is almost impossible to find a bad item. Take the plunge, if you are into good distorted rock guitars, snappy arrangements, tight rythmn sections and gutsy vocals then you will not be disappointed. An excellent Live album - without a safety net!"
2,Not so good company,"Indeed, by this time the magic was almost completely gone. Even while they took their time after the fine Desolation Angels. Downhill ryder and Electricland are pretty good and there are some other tracks that are ok (Untie The Knot). It's the slick 80s production that further brings the overall result down. Burnin' sky wasn't good either but at least that one offered some rockin' fun."
4,A decent album from Bad company,Rough Diamonds is one of the mosr above average albums from Bad Company and though it may not be as good from other albums it's still a buy.Highly recommended.
5,This album is great,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This album is highly underrated. We rarely hear songs from it on radio, yet I listen to it over and over and never get sick of it. Every song has a little story or a theme. It is very well done. In my opinion, Painted Face is one of the best Bad Company songs of all time."
4,When I left Las Vegas,"I was an Airman stationed at Nellis AFB from 2000-2003. When I was packing up to move to North Dakota I heard 'Electricland' from Bad Co's 10 from 6. I had to get this record. Yes - it might've been a flop - but it summed up my views on Vegas. I was glad to move away. I like the spooky sound they had for that song. The rest of the album is pretty good, my favorites being: ""Old Mexico"" and ""Racetrack"" as it reminds me of misadventures while stationed in Vegas.My advice is listen to this album open-minded. It has a certain mood. It's actually one of my favorite 'bargin bin' tapes."
4,Rave report,"I have been informed that this printed material is quite exceptionally well written, plan to find a dark corner and find out, thanks"
4,"Anna, a/k/a Ellen","Anna is a good family woman and also a good writer. She manages life situations well, except that she kills herself when learning of the lump in her breast. That is too much for her. The book is well-written and, as all of Ellen Gilchrist's writings I have read so far, makes for interesting reading. Only one problem: from time to time, very foul street language is being used, and that does damage on the overall, especially since Ellen Gilchrist normally does not use that language. But she is visible through Anna."
2,Anna loves to 'do it' !,"Anna loves to 'do it'. Anna 'does it' a lot. Anna 'does it'with a married man. Anna also 'does it' with a much younger man who isvery cute. Anna thinks she's better than everyone else, but only because it's true and she is brutally honest at all times! Anna can't have children. Anna's family is colorful and numerous and they have names like Putty, LeLe and Jimmy John. Anna has so many relatives it's hard for her to interfere with them all, but she tries. Anna's sister Helen is an uptight prune, but when she finds out how much fun it is to 'do it', thanks to Anna, she is transformed into a happy and attractive woman."
1,This is Great Fiction?,"Sorry, but I thought this book [wasn't very good],and I will never read another Ellen Gilchrist novel. If I wanted a book full of descriptions of clothes and furnishings, I'd buy a magazine. Felt nothing for the characters,who I thought were all shallow."
5,pleading your case ca. 1200 to 1500 A.D.,"This is a scanned copy of a book published in the early 20th century which presents pedigree charts based upon court cases argued during the medieval period. This version is more complete and less expensive than the General Books LLC edition, which doesn't include the pedigrees derived from Bracton's Notebook or the index. The print is occasionally faded but readable.The material is of great value to genealogists working with medieval English families. Because the pedigrees are based upon legal proceedings, one might expect them to be more reliable than charts in the various Visitations, though not all families found in Visitations are represented here. However, even for families which do appear in Visitations, you may find references to family members in the Plea Rolls who aren't shown in Visitations.A very useful reference and highly recommended."
3,A great device.. But....,"I am a gadget freak. I bought my first HDD camcorder although i had one Sony minidv camcorder. Compare to sony this device is far better looking, better design. The menu is great (far better than expected from JVC).Everyting was good till the HD start to give error. I cannot use it now.. And i dont live in Europe. So? Yeah god help me..:)So no more comment till i have it back from service..."
5,So happy to receive this cd - excellent,I love the nostalgia this cd brought back. It was shipped to me quickly and in perfect shape and I enjoyed it thoughout the holiday season.
5,Great Addition to Tractor,"The trailer is a great addition to the Step 2 tractor! The only negative is that the ""hitch"" does not lock in place and it can be turned causing the trailer to come off the tractor while playing. Our son loves to fill the trailer with toys. I think he and his little brother will enjoy these toys for a long time and the trailer will give him more ideas for using the tractor in his play."
3,31 REASONS PEOPLE DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR FINANICIAL HARVEST,I LIKED THE BOOK BECAUSE IT SPOKE TO MY HEARTI WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO SOMEONE SEEKING GOD DIRECTION & SATISFACTION
3,?,"Picture?? Anyone?? A picture of the item would greatly influence my decision, so here's a marketing tip: SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO BUY, DON'T SIT THERE AND TELL THEM ABOUT IT. Intensive research has concluded that at least 85-90% of people learn visually, not verbally. So for them to picture how their DS would look in the case, they need to actually see the case for themselves, whether it be a picture (which would be how most people would prefer to see it) or driving up to a Toys R Us store just to see what it looks like. Come on, Amazon, I know you can do better than this."
2,Tiny Dumb Doesn't work,"Well, the only reason I even give this thing a two, is you can put your nintendo DS in it, and some games and... thats about it. By the way, what was up with that one girl who wrote the second review. I dont know about you, but I was in for a review, not a lecture. Well, if your a light gamer and dont have very much stuff, this is a good case, but if your a hardcore gamer, you'll need a bigger case."
4,A MUST for fans of the book,"I bought this plush toy and the book in the same order. And I am so glad I did! My niece was ecstatic to have Moishe and be able to read the book. It is durable in a sense that a two-year old can throw it down flights of stairs, in a sink, in the mud, in the snow, and outside a moving vehicle and still have it ready to do battle the next day. Since my niece who originally owned it has grown out of her ""phase"" (I bought this 2 years ago), she's passed it on to her baby sister and it still looks great."
2,NOT GREAT,"After a short time of use maybe 2 or 3 months it started shutting down, a few shots then the batteries were drained! It took great pictures but only 5 or 6??"
1,Lack substance,"I found the book to be so easy to read that it borders on boring. The level of expressions are childish and the sentences are too short considering it is written by someone who claims academia.The story was somewhat interesting but it would have been better told as an oral account. If the author was a success it would have added legitimacy to his story. The school in which Bernard is a principal has received ""F"" ratings for two consecutive years. It is best to purchase books by authors who have completed their journey."
2,Great but for a fatal flaw,"So I bought my pair of Bronx shoes from a shoe store, not Amazon, but they are the same model. I really like the style, and they are very comfortable. I liked everything about the shoes until one of the eyelets came apart and scratched a hole through the shoe tongue about five months after I bought them. No problem, I thought, Bronx is supposed to be great about repairing or replacing shoes. Well, that is not the case. I emailed Bronx, and they were not helpful at all. So, this is a great shoe, but it seems to have a manufacturing defect wherein the holes that the laces go through come undone and a little metal wire will poke through. I didn't use these as football shoes or anything, just light to normal use. Well, it was all too bad, because I wanted to love them. Would not recommend for the price."
2,not worth it,"Despite a promising story by Moore, the art is terrible. The coloring is not bad but the drawings are really, really amatuer and ruin the story. I've been a fan of alternative comics for over 10 yrs and was really looking forward to an adult meditation on sexuality by Moore but the art renders this book almost unreadable. Check it out at your local shop if possible before buying."
2,CNPS7000 cannot cool Core 2 Quad,"I have a quad core Intel chip, and the CNPS7000 fan just can't keep up with the processor. During summer days, my computer will crash after extended, heavy use. If you have a Socket 775 processor that produces a significant amount of heat, I would strongly recommend buying a new heatsink/fan rather than trying to use existing fans made for cooler processors."
4,A thoroughly charming collection.,"Just in time for the holidays, the Netherlands Bach Society has brought out a thoroughly charming collection of 17th century Christmas music. For this CD, the Bach Society Chorus is joined by a smaller group named the Capella Figuralis, both of them under the confident direction of Jos van Veldhoven. Several famous composers are represented on the disc, headed by Michael Praetorius, Dietrich Buxtehude, and, of course, J.S. Bach. Lesser known figures are also included, however, and some of the songs listed as Anonymous (not the Anonymous 4) are equally authentic and moving. Verily, they make a joyful noise unto the Lord."
4,Informative and Insightful,A good read that provides a lot of information about Mormonism. Will definitely help me in my witness to others.
1,Disappointing,I just felt that this book was too religious. I don't talk bad on other religions and I don't like when literature does. We need to respect others beliefs and not believe what we read from a book that is all opinion. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends.
1,False Teachings,"The reason Mormons don't ""know about these teachings"" is because it's not true! I only read bits a pieces of this book and it was ridiculous how inaccurate it is. If you are investigating the Mormon faith, ask a Mormon. Don't rely on false teachings and anti-Mormon material. I don't even know where they come up with these crazy ideas they ""think"" is ""truth.""Get your information from the source, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Go to [...]"
2,Just consider the author,"I read some of the book. I understand where she's coming from, a disenchanted mormon (who are traditionally quite passionate about their old faith). Just consider that, and that she has cherry-picked some of the admittedly weirdest quotes from some of the most controversial of mormon figures to craft an attack against the mormon church. I wasn't impressed by her story or her writing style, but she did write in an engaging way.To say though that mormons aren't Christian though is simply stupid, no matter where you stand. First you have to ask by whose definition of Christian are we considering them? And then you should see that it is circular logic. I am liberal with my definition so all who rely on Christ for salvation are Christians. But if you believe that only your faith practices ""true"" Christianity then you will be quite lonely with your Christian friends."
1,"If looking for another Mormon bashing book, this is for you.","I have read this book. I decided to read because I was interested in the authors beliefs and wanted to learn of her journey. Though there are moments of this they are far too few. In my oppinion it is mostly full of a extremely slanted view of the LDS church. There are many points that are stated as fact that are false. I do not wish to go point to point on all of the inaccuries. They are countless. Those points have been argued countlessly and have no reason to start another.I felt like it was another Mormon bash. I would loved to have read her story of her mighty change of heart. Of her story. Her love of the Savior. Not the confusing, contradicting, false information she squeezed it in with.I know my Savior lives and loves me. I thought this book was going to share another journey of hope. But I found myself kind of feeling sad at the missed opportunty instead of uplifted."
4,Great offer from Thelma,"The wonderful maze that mormonism has pulled off since it's inception is amazing. Thelma has outlined the blatant lies that are constantly withdrawn from potential converts. I recently ran into a missionary who denied the fact of blacks holding priesthood roles until 1978. I, like Thelma gently explained that the coverups are on going to this day. He didn't think the Mormons had anything to do with the the Olympic bribe scandal. Naivity is a great characteristic to have if you are looking for a converts as a missionary. I look forward to a follow up on any one who accepts her challenge. Morman-a word used to imply that Joseph Smith was a man-made religion based on his own inspiration. For the reviewer who denies his own ignorance of what is Christian doctrine and what is plagurized replicas. But that is just one more truth that Thelma explains, the lies and deceit of the mormon church. Good people will enjoy this book. People in denial won't."
2,Disorganized explanation of Mormonism,"Grandmother recollects growing up in the Mormon church.I could not get into this at all. Geer started with an extended description of being grateful she was born a white Mormon and then went into how our God ""grew up"" under a different God that did not interest or appeal to me at all. I gave up quickly."
1,"The theology didn't bother me, but the writing!","I am not Mormon and was interested in reading this to better learn the differences between what most Chrisrians believe and what Mormons believe. I did learn that, but yikes - Ms. Geer seems like a nice person, but she is just *not* a good writer. There was something about the tone all the way through that just bothered me. Oh well, at least the price was right!"
2,Not quite what's its cracked up to be,"I have read both Neuromancer by Gibson and Snow Crash by Stephenson and others novels by both authors and this book is not in the same league as either. I will admit to not finishing it yet but thus far Ms. Ore has managed to make it very confusing. I don't mind books I have to stay with to enjoy but this reader prefers something a little less confusing. Is our heroine in the present? The past? The future? If she's in the past, why is she using modern syntax? Wait! Is it really a ""she"" in the first place? I can't figure out squat and as I read for enjoyment, I don't have time to screw around with it which is why it's on the very back burner for the time being.Read it if you have nothing else better to do."
2,Boring.,"This plot of this book doesn't go anywhere, and it takes a long time to do it. I was tempted to stop reading it partway through, but I figured it would get better towards the end. It didn't."
1,Poor Verismo,"Absolutely no recording for the hi-fi purist. Even for a 38 year old recording the sound is badly congested to the point of being painful to listen to. The music, Giordano's last opera, is definitely not up to the standards of most of his earlier work. The performers, especially the soprano, are overparted. Plenty of off pitch singing especially when ""can-belto"" gets really competative. In short, a second rate provincial Italian cast. Much too much extranious applause."
5,"The Best, whatever they are...?","So, if you want strong hands, relieve that pain in your elbows or wrists/hands from typing too many reviews on azon, or just want some really awesome and pretty rubber bands to add to your bizarre collection, then these are for you!(just make sure you're using them correctly to get results... check the brochure in the package)p.s. this company's really nice. always upgrading quality and keeping it simple... could use some better marketing and branding identity tho, maybe a graphic designer could help out with their boring logo?)"
1,Break easily,"I broke the medium strength band on the first day of use.I'm happy that they come with duplicates, but these things shouldn't be breaking that easily.Just buy rubber bands."
1,They're rubber bands.,"They are rubber bands. Plain and simple. They are treated so it is claimed. I am sure that they will last longer due to that treatment, but why not just buy rubber bands at an office supply store and when they age or break, buy new ones? Certainly not worth the money."
3,Wasted money,"I love the fact that these bands come in various strengths. That's about the only plus I can give them.In the future, if I decide to spend $10 on rubber bands, I need to make sure that they will never break. I told myself ""these other reviewers must be stretching the product too much."" Nope. After 3 days of use, probably 2 hours total usage each day, the white one snapped. Granted, I was using the same one the entire time, but I still feel as though the band snapped before even a reasonable amount of use.I would not recommend that you buy this product at the price I did. $10 is too much for rubber bands. If they hit $5, go for it. Having bashed the product's durability, I will say that they do provide an excellent work out for your hand muscles. My forearm was burning the day after I got my set. They totally do what they are supposed to do, they just don't last as long as they should."
4,Great with other grip exercises.,"Not 5 stars 'cause its very expensive for what it is. Like it very much otherwise. If price isnt a problem, go for it."
3,Excellent...When you get the correct batch.,"I LOVE every product made by this company, and these bands are no exception. HOWEVER, during my last order of my Expand Your Hand Bands, I was unpleasantly surprised to learn that they are composed of a new silicone type rubber, and that the green and yellow bands were significantly softer than the white bands. In other words, they were not graduated the way they should be. Hopefully this is just a bad batch."
2,"It was a great little exercise, til it snapped","The band did what it said fantastically. I would just sit all day at work and expand and use it to keep my hands busy.Second day of using the yellow band, it snapped. I bought these because i thought they wouldn't. Now that i know they will, might as well just buy regular rubber bands for this kind of exercise."
3,DON'T BUY THESE,"Please heed all the warnings from the other reviewers and save your money. At first I thought to myself 'Oh these people must be misusing the product somehow.' But it turned out that these bands will break BEFORE even a moderate period of use.Pros:- they give your forearm extensors a good workout (especially if you're using them to balance strength gains from using a hand gripper)- you get two of each band with your packageCons:- the price for the quality of product- a total lack of durability (the bands WILL break before a reasonable period of time, even if you do keep them out of sunlight, out of heat, etc.)Overall, I'd recommend passing on this product; go to your local office supply store and buy like a 50-pack of durable rubber bands which will do the same thing."
3,One of my green bands broken after 3rd time of using,One of my green bands broken after 3rd time of it's usage. I hope that other will live much longer :(
1,OK but you can get better,"I picked up a pair of these for my daughter. She complained of a buzing sound. I tried them out and noticed the following. No or very little low frequency response (Base). With the volume up there is a hissing in the background. Since the frequency response of these earbuds is mostly high end, that hiss could quickly get annoying. By lowering the volume on the inline volume control and turning up the volume on the device it was plugged into, I was able to reduce the background hiss.I have another set Plane quiet noise canceling headphones which are substantially better than the Coby earbuds. However the Plane Quiet headphones sell for about $70.00 so there is a significant difference in the price.These are OK but I think you might consider spending a little more money getting something better. If, on the otherhand, you are looking for a cheap pair of disposable noise canceling earbuds and have low expectations then you might consider the Coby eabuds."
2,Very poor design,The plastic tips for the ear buds come off ridiculously easy - I haven't lost one yet but I've come close so many times I know its just a matter of time. The noise cancellation is OK at best but it adds a static sound that is almost as irritating as the engine noises your trying to cancel out.
1,Poor,"This earphone has no noise canceling.It is a fake.I tried it in jetplane, train, bus. I did not feel a noise canceling at all.And the ear plug is not comfortable.Do not buy this product."
1,Useless Junk - Steer Well Clear,"Nasty earbuds, awful sound quality (no bass, and abrasive treble), and the ""noise cancellation"" is a joke. Enabling the noise cancelation just appears to throw white noise at you - it was ""quieter"" with the feature turned off.Worst headphones I've ever bought; don't make the same mistake as me."
3,Not their best,"I have just about every trust LP/CD and this one was certainly hard to find. I finally shelled out over the odds for it and it's a departure from the norm. Their previous CD, Europe et Haines had something for everyone but this one takes a lot of listening. Maybe if you are fluent in French the lyrics make up for the music but my French is mediocre, to say the least."
1,Poorly researched and shoddily executed,"I found this book a remarkably poor investment of my money. It did little to explicate the subject matter, displayed heavy bias in its flimsy arguments and otherwise offers nothing new but much objectionable nonsense to medieval studies. The footnotes, in particular, were egregiously bad."
4,Dress-up,Although my daughter likes this I do have to say that it did not come with the accessories.
3,Just an overview,I was looking for some help in rolling out an Avvid solution for a client. This wasn't the book. I read over 3/4 of the book found little if any answers to my questionsWe did roll out Avvid and it works great with no help from the book.
2,Worthless book,"With a Title of ""Configuring Cisco AVVID...."" You would think they would have bothered to show atleat one example of how to configure something on Call Manager or any of the related AVVID components. The book is full of basic descriptions of the various pieces of the AVVID Architecture but nothing pertaining to how they interact or how they are inter-related. I can only assume that they were surfing the cisco website and ""word-smithed"" the marketing info available on CCO."
1,Way too basic,This book will provide an overview of the AVVID architecture. It is not an implementation guide.
4,Good Book,"This book was written as an AVVID overview. There really aren't too many technical configurations, but it gives great scenarios on who you might implement an AVVID network. I wasn't sure what AVVID really was, after reading the book I've got an excellent idea. I still need some ""hands on experience"" with configuring the Cisco routers and Call Manager, but now I know how all of the pieces work together!"
5,Great kids' book,"This is a great book for kids. My boys all love it, and I don't mind reading it over and over again."
5,WOW,Fianna is so pretty!She comes with:-bell-sleeved purple top-brown and white pants-brown skirt-brown shirt-white boots-70s CD-vest-bagsand other really cute things!A bratz collectors dream doll!
2,A Little Enjoyable,"What this game looks like, is what you'll get. If it looks like an OK game like it did for me, it will be. If you're still a kid, and you're still at the age where other people's pain and toilet humor are still hilarious, the game will be hilarious. So, in other words, I reccomend the game your young kids, and warn any teenagers that are interested in this game- this is a game you play when you are bored and have nothing better to do, and even then, it won't entertain you much. It is only good for a few short rounds. From then, you start losing interest. Last but not least, I extremely disreccomend the game for anyone of great seriousness and/or over-maturity. This game it OK, but not good."
3,"Quirky, but a good way to kill some time","It's weird, but in a good way. I initially purchased it only for a resident evil related level, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The plot makes no sense, but it's no more nonsensical than Katamari Damacy (which I also love). If you want something very different, give this a go."
3,One pain in the Arse!,"Ok, I'll keep it simple: You get what you pay for! I wanted a storage cabinet that matched my vanity, but didn't know what ""Some Assembly required"" really meant! It came in a slew of pieces and parts - all totaled, over a hundred, if you count the screws (not including me!)The main parts numbered around 15, and you do need the diagram to get it right. Instructions were actually OK. Material was solid, but after you spent 4 hours putting the damn thing together, you had to ask, ""Was it worth it?"", especially since the parts really didn't fit all that well together once asembled.If I had to do it all over again, well, I wouldn't go down this path - and I am more than handy when it comes to household improvements. The choice is yours ..."
1,"Worst service ever, it deserves a no star rating!!!!","The product didn't fit the advertised phone and when I tried to return it, the company rep was accusatory, glib and insulting in his reponses. kept going back and forth for 4 days until he actually refunded the money. I would NEVER NEVER buy from this company again."
3,Grew out of it,"When I was about 14 years old, yeah, I listened to this nonstop. Going to Pasalacqua was the sort of song I could listen to 10-20 times a day. It's still got some replay value, and Paper Lanterns, Only of You, Pasalacqua, and Knowledge are all solid. But really, it's repetitive, it's garage-band-ish, and it's nowhere near the quality of Dookie, or even Kerplunk.Hate to say it, because I love Green Day, but there just isn't much substance to this one- especially compared to American Idiot, which you most definitely should buy."
2,nobody cares about the drummer,Okay am i the only drummer here who wrote a review? Tre Cool is Green Days Drummer. He wasnt with the band until Kerplunk. The guy who played for them until this album was Tre's Student. Tre Cool is great I cant stand the way he tunes his snare drum is sounds choked and high but hes still great. I own one of his sticks. I dont think it was green Day until Tre Cool came cuz thats the green day we all came to love. But if you like their old style better this still has some good songs and its worth the small price it costs.
1,Babyish!,"Green Day's debut has one thing going for it: It's catchy... but only the first time you listen to it. I swear, every song on here sounds the same (surprise! just like all their other albums). Plus, it's really babyish. How much cornier can these lyrics get? The prime example: ""At the Library"". Billie sings (on the studio version) 'Oh well, It happened again/She walked away with her boyfriend'. And if you've seen the live home video recording from 7/16/90, Billie changed those lyrics to 'Oh well, It happened again/She walked away with MY boyfriend', and was totally serious about it! Coming clean, indeed, Billie."
2,not the best,"i am not a green day hater. in fact, i own every album they have ever released. the people who think this album is one of their best are sadly mistaken. the only descent tracks are going to pasalaqua, disappearing boy, green day, and the judge's daughter. about half of the songs on here are just the same beat and same guitar and bass over and over with different lyrics. eventually all the songs just sound the same. i would reccomend kerplunk if you want to listen to some pre-dookie green day. there is so much more variety and good music on that album. 1039/smoothed out slappy hours is an o.k. look into green day's past, but the music is just not that great."
1,I must say this is the worst music I've ever heard.,No comparison to Green Day's other (superb) albums. Should not have been released.
5,how could anyone NOT give this album 5 stars?,"theres not even enough words to describe how great this album is. i could listen to it everyday and never become tired of it. its got this raw sound.. kerplunk has it too, but personally i prefer this album to kerplunk. the songs are amazing and this is definitely a classic. a lot of people really hate this CD because they think its just ""green day trying to find themselves"", and yes, maybe it is, but they did one heck of an awesome job doing it."
5,One of Green Day's Earlier Classix...,"...is definitely a must-own for any fan of the modern day punk-rockers. This album is a combination of some of their earlier singles albums and is definitely one of their best. Thay started out as an almost swear-free group who wrote songs mostly about guys and the girls that they never got. It starts off with the catchy tune ""At the Library,"" and from the beginning you know it's going to be a fun ride. It whips past you with three cords so fast that all 19 songs are done before you even know it. They only swear on one songs once, ""Knowledge,"" which was actually written by some other band. This song is kind of a gateway in which the band became what they are now. My personal favorite is ""Dry Ice,"" a good love song. This album is hard to find in stores, because it was independently produced. If you like Green Day, you'll also like Blink 182, Lit, and Kid Rock."
3,Decent early work...,"These guys are one of my favorite bands, primarily based on their output over the past ten years or so. I did start collecting with ""Dookie"" however, but still, today, now have everything on CD and DVD Billie Joe and the boys have done. I have to say that this is more for completists or those wanting to dig deeper into the Green Day catalog. More than anything, it simply reflects a significant force in modern music taking some early (but reasonably solid) baby steps before catching its stride."
5,Still their best!,"I really did like American Idiot, as I'm a fan of the longer songs in any genre (Type O Negative, Frank Zappa, etc.). But this album still held onto it's top position in my collection. It really upset me to see that these ""punks"" decided to remove any of these classics from their current ""Idiotic"" setlist at their live shows (save for ""Knowledge"", which doesn't count as it's a cover tune). ""Paper Lanterns"" has been a fan favorite since they began playing it in 1989, how can they deny that?!Other great tracks are; At the Library, Don't Leave Me, I was There, Green Day, Going to Pasalacqua, The Judge's Daughter, 1,000 Hours & Dry Ice.Tracks 1-10 - 39/Smooth (1st LP)Tracks 11-18 - 1,000 Hours and Slappy EPsTrack 19 - Flipside: The Big One (Compilation)"
4,Their first album: these gys have it,Even though this album was their first it sticks out from the others. It has many different types of way punk is played. Either somewhat slow or really fast and short. If you like Green Day purchase this album.
1,Total Garbage!,Green day's first album is awful and shows that they where very in-experenced when they first brought this out.
1,Loser!,Does any of you stupid people know the true meaning behind this punk wannabe poppy group? Slappy hours is how long is singing about how long it takes for them to cut up women in several hours and being cannibals for 1039 hours.
5,From the Sweet Children days!,"This album was really fun and exciting to listen to. I wasn't around when they made the four albums that make-up this one, and I only first heard Green Day in the car with their hit Basket Case, from their album: Dookie.As in other reviews, I first got into Green Day when Warning came out in 2000. And now with this release of the old treasure of Sweet Children, along with Kerplunk, I finally get to hear Green Day as they used to be.This is a nice CD to add to your Green Day collection. My favorite tracks of this album are Don't Leave Me and I Want to Be Alone."
4,Green Day,I really enjoyed this cd. It was nice to actually have the lyrics because as with much of Green Day's earlier works the words just don't come out that clearly. Other than that this is the ultimate best collection of Green Day.
4,They suck? At least they can spell.,"Seriously....Ladies and Gentlemen, I do believe we have found evidence of a true American Idiot. The evidence comes in the form of a verbally incoherent music review. I can tell you, your wit and insight have influenced my choice of music. *smirk*Rock on with your illiterate non-poser self."
2,Same old Sound,"Disappointed for the most part...the extras are cool but not nearly enough to justify a re-release. Other bands I've been a fan of have re-released old stuff, but took the time to make the music 100 times better....redid guitar tracks, vocals, etc., made it more polished. The actual music from the album sounds exactly like it did in 1991. A great album, don't get me wrong, but don't expect a wall of guitar sound now. It's the same as it was. If a couple of songs off a concert video interest you or a handful of songs from an old radio show interest you...spend the money. If you're a fan and have never purchased this album...spend the money. If you're old like me and bought this in 1991, save your money....it's been there, done that. On the bright side, I didn't buy the last couple Green Day albums so I'm still ahead in the long run. ALL, no ALL!"
4,Good But Not As Good As The Others,This is Green Day's first album it is good but not worthy of five stars it has some good songs like going to pasalacqua and 16 but not good enough sorry. Good for trying though guys
2,Find a difference.,Some of the songs are good. I don't think the quality is nearly as good as their most recent 3. Some of the songs sound the same. I get confused with alot of the songs. Either you like it or you don't. I have mixed feelings.-Matt Laird
5,one of the best,"this is my 2nd favorite album, next to dookie. Billie Joe's voice sounds different, but you get used to it after a while. Plus, it's almost an hour long, which is a plus from the other records that are about half as long."
5,Solid,"The very first glimpse of Green Day....it rocks. This is solid punk...loud, fast, and awesome. Anyone who remotely likes punk should dig this. The price is great and well worth it, because it comes with all of that cool extra stuff. If you enjoyed this album, then try Kerplunk also, because it has the same great punk sound. I like Insomniac a lot, but after hearing this I had to consider, because 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours rocks too.I don't really have any favorites on here because I like them all, but At the Library, I was There, and Green Day are some good ones. The song Green Day will tell you all you need to know about how they came up with the band's name...... So if you've found yourself becoming more and more disappointed with Green Day as the years go on, I suggest that you look backward, not forward. So, have you bought it yet? If not, then stop reading this and do yourself a favor by buying it!!!!!!!"
4,Much nicer than the photo,"The photo for this item is washed out and displays the toy with curled, distorted ""wings"" -- the actual item is has smooth wings and the orangy-red coloration on the sides of the head is nice and bright. The material it's made from is silky and the whole item appears well-made."
2,choking hazard,"So these bars are adequately tasty and seem to have the nutrients I'm looking for, but even after thorough chewing have a tough, thick texture. I have a good set of teeth, a normal salivary system, always drink water while eating, and am not (to my knowledge) in any way physically or mentally deficient, but have almost choked a couple of times on these dang things!"
4,protein bar,Tastes great. I eat half of one bar 30 min before I work out. Also works well as a nighttime snack.
2,Hard to swallow...,"Before you do the ""that's what she said"" jokes, just realize that these really aren't tasty at all. I have the marshmallow dream flavor, and honestly they taste like crap, and generally I'll eat anything. Sure, they're full of protein, probably decent for you, but I can barely choke down one. The entire box is a daunting task. If you ignore the taste, they fill you up, and are indeed full of protein, but if you can't swallow it you can't do much... overall quite disappointed."
1,ew,"i love pure protein bars because they are one of the best tasting protein bars out there. the strawberry shortcake one, though, tastes absolutely disgusting. its way to sweet, leaves a bad after taste, and it's a challenge to actually eat the stupid thing."
2,Too much per gram of Protien,"This product has 30 grams of protien and the cost is just over 2/bar. The exact same brand sells a 20g protien bar at Target at $5.99 for a 6 pack, just under $1 per bar."
1,"""PURE THROAT GLUE""","If your looking for a delicious protein bar,""Pure Protein"" bars are not the right choice.. I purchased the strawberry flavor and the blueberry flavor and though the blueberry was a lot easier to get down as it wasn't as rank tasting as the strawberry. I would recommend that you do not buy this product.Also the consistency of this product during the chewing process is dangerous as it becomes very thick and sticky in your mouth and may cause a blockage in your throat rendering you unable to either spit it out or swallow it. Somewhat like a thick, fast drying epoxy/glue.I will never purchase this product from anywhere again.My favorite protein bar is called ""Power Crunch"" bar, but due to the fact that I was looking for a lower price by the case and was also looking for a smaller bar, which had more protein packed into it. You live and you learn folks, but all I can tell you are 6 last words..... ""You get what you pay for"""
1,Stay Away from STRAWBERRY cheesecake!,"THIS REVIEW IS 4 STRAWBERRY cheesecake! NOT PEANUT BUTTER. I am big on protein bars. They are fast and convenient. Not being too keen on chocolate and peanut butter I prefer the few alternative flavors around, which is not many. I usually go for a plain vanilla yogurt one but thought I would try these as they seemed to be a good brand. Unfortunately, my first choice was strawberry cheesecake flavor. I can put up with some flavor discrepancies but the strawberry is just plain gross. It has a terrible after taste that hits you about 10 seconds after each bite. I have to choke them down with milk just to get through the bar. I do not recommend it at all. I would most likely pass on the blueberry as well."
2,"Great protein content, bad taste","I got these bars for snacking during the day to maintain high protein intake. And even just eating one bite is very hard due to the fact that it really doesn't taste too good. I guess I can't expect too much from a purpose made protein bar with low carbs, but this was to the point where I really can't put it down."
4,"Yums, but BIG!!","Hey y'all - these are my fave protein bars out there, with great taste, and one of the lowest sugar-to-protein ratios on the market, BUT be aware that the 31g protein is achieved by making a bigger version of the 20g protein bar.The good news is that it's the same great taste. The caveat is that there's more bar to love, so if you feel full after eating a normal-sized bar, you're going to be putting 1/2 of this back in your jersey pocket - not a bad thing, but something to consider."
4,"Good, but overwhelmingly sweet.","I am good with this product. It is convenient around my work out.Why not have a less sweet version, which might be between normal and plain.P.S. I am not worried about the sugar necessarily, but I usually find ""normal"" products, such as yogurts, are over sweet."
4,Great!,Love this strawberry flavor! The blueberry is comparable. I really enjoy this product. Great meal replacement. I also have it as a dessert after dinner instead of something else.
4,"LIke it, except for a bit of aftertaste","Great specs... high protein, low sugars (though not necessarily very low carbs). Quite filling. I use them before or after weight training. So far quiet happy. Feels like real fruit in there.Now only if I could get over the synthetic aftertaste, it would be perfect..."
2,Pure Protein Bar Chocolate Peanut Better,"Chewy, a little gritty, and overall not very good tasting...IMO. I won't be purchasing anymore of these bars. I purchased because of some of the reviews on these bars. What a let down."
3,May not be worth the work!,"PROS: High in protein, low in sugar, enough carbs to use as a meal replacement, doesn't taste bad.CON: Very hard and chewy if refrigerated."
1,Low Carb My Ass,"These bars contain 26g of Carbs. If you're trying to stay under 30g per day, these will wreck you. They taste pretty good, but they are advertised as ""Low Carb."" That is a crock."
1,Horrible!!!,"I have had many protein bars but these ate the absolute worst. Gummy, not chewy, a chore to eat. It might be worth the effort if they tasted good but somewhere between medicinal and putrid will suffice. Avoid these at all costs!"
1,tastes horrible,"its hard chewy and nothing like the picture. It taste just so awful. I ordered 4 boxes with different flavors, so far the chocolate peanut butter is the only descent one, the rest are just horrible. Its like toffee."
4,"Great bar, Great service","I've had the bar before and it is a great protein snack. I've had gastric bypass surgery and must find ways to boost the amt. of protein I ingest. This bar is great. It satisfies my sweet tooth but also helps me reach my daily protein goal.The service was great. I received the order 3 days after I placed the order using regular shipping. Also the price is much cheaper than going to The Vitamin Shoppe, Walmart, and Target."
2,Just too sweet,"I've had a few of the other flavors of Pure Protein bars. They are all on the sweet side, so I tend to think of them as a candy bar type of ""food"". Except they fill you up. Anyway, the s'mores flavor is just too too sweet. I like their double chocolate and the peanut butter bars the best."
5,Best tasting protein bar,This bar has an excellent flavor and is very high protein. This bar has the least amount of calories for the amount of protein as any protein bar I have found. No trans fat. The grocery store runs out quickly so I am buying them via the Internet so I can keep a supply.
4,Tasty,"I really like these strawberry bars. They have a yogurt like coating, and a strawberry center. It's a nice change of pace in a world where most protein bars are all chocolate."
5,Workout Boyfriend,I got these bars for my boyfriend because he told me they dont carry them in our local grocery store but theyre his favorite. so i went on amazon and they had the best price and i got him a box. He was very apreciative and i felt good about it and the product itself was great.
2,not so good,On high protein diet due to surgery....I've had much better protein bars and they COST A LOT LESS. Once is enough.
3,The long awaited but somewhat letdown Black Company novel,I first started reading the Black Company series around 1990. Once I started I read all of them in a matter of a month. So after waiting for what seemed like an eternity I was suprised that Mr. Cook decided to alter his storyline. Don't get me wrong he is a brilliant writer but this book begins a significantly different variation from his earlier works. The story continues to be told as of old through the eyes of the annalist but since a new annalist is now telling the story you would think that this new annalist would tell it with their own personal flare. It still sounds like Croaker telling the story but Croakers the captian now and Murgan is Annalist. This book sounds like Cook has reached a critical point in where he wants the series to go but he hasn't quite figured it out yet. On its own this is a great book but within the series it definitly lacks something that the earlier books had.Commented on by an avid reader in Central Delaware.
1,A good writer gone bad,"I love Cook's other Black Company books, but this one is atrocious. Bleak Seasons is possibly the worst book I have ever read. Confusing, convoluted, and a real chore to get through. I hope the final three in the series are better. What a stinker."
2,flashbacks,"Ive loved every book of the black company so far, a very refreshing way of writing that what I have seen in hundreds of other books. After reading the first 50 pages of Bleak Seasons though.. I think my brain is bleeding. Jumping back and forth through time and having Someone besides Croaker or The Lady as narrator just kills it. I'll keep reading just to get it done and hope that the next book is better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"One of the weakest Black Company novels. If you like the others though, this is still good enough to read, as the whole sordid saga continues. Sordid from the point of view of the Company, anyway, and the conditions they have to endure to survive. That seems to have always been the case. Here, they do have one or two small advantages that keep them going, however."
4,"Not the best of the Black Company, but still very good.","Glen Cook's Black Company novels are some of the best fantasy books on the market. Gritty, fast-paced, humorous, and realistic, the books are definitely page-turners. When I was just getting into Bleak Seasons, I was disappointed to realize that much of it would concern the same events that occurred in Dreams of Steel, but from a different perspective. It was better than I expected though. Some questions from the previous book are answered while new questions come to light. Cook's dark humor, largely absent from Dreams of Steel, is definitely back in Bleak Seasons. I also love the mysterious voice (I won't spoil it by revealing who the voice belongs to) that welcomes Murgen back when he has his mental trips into the past. Black Company fans will enjoy the book. Readers unfamiliar with the Black Company owe it to themselves to get the first book, The Black Company, and read the entire series."
3,"Interesting, and yet somewhat disappointing","Being a big fan of Cook's ""Taken-infested"" Black Company books, I was a little underwhelmed with this latest addition. Instead of moving forward with a story that had some good momentum, this back-filled the happenings in the city under siege throughout Dreams of Steel.I did appreciate the mental trips of Murgen as it brought to life the terrible experiences living in a crowded city under siege without support outside. Murgen's Annuals are an interesting double-take of Dreams of Steel in that they illuminate major events from an inside perspective.Hopefully Glen Cook will get out the next Black Company book in less than 6 years?? If not, have some respect for the Company and put 'em down for the BIG sleep."
5,Very pleased!,Easy to follow instructions! Adorable product! I personalized the teacups and used them for my daughter's tea party. Geat deal.
5,Ideal for New-to-Export individuals,"Written by the US Department of Commerce especially for small or medium sized businesses who have never exported before. Covers selecting a country, adapting your product, find a channel of distribution, government regulations, trade barriers, getting paid, terms of sale, and shipping options"
5,total fan,I have owned a pair of Klipsch Klipschorns since 1972First large purchase after leaving USMCI have enjoyed to date with no problem at oll and expectto pass them on to my grand kids and expect them to do the same
4,An intriguing collection of essays,"In this series of essays, Colm Tóibín explores the lives of nine artists whose homosexuality greatly influenced their art, and whose art greatly influenced their lives. He writes about Oscar Wilde, Thomas Mann, Thom Gunn, Pedro Almodóvar, James Baldwin, Roger Casement, Elizabeth Bishop, Mark Doty, and Francis Bacon (with a final essay about Catholic Ireland and how it is changing, with references to Micheál Mac Liammóir and Cathal Ó Searchaigh). Tóibín writes about not only their lives and art, but also the challenge and limitation of being labeled a ""gay artist"". These essays are fascinating and illuminating, and are a welcome addition to literary criticism, especially since it's a fellow writer bringing an interesting view to the canon."
1,2nd Rip Up,"I have found therapy in ripping up bad books. The first was a Stieg Larsson. Basin and Range was my second. The first chapter left me breathless. I wanted the author to provide interludes in his rush of words. He didn't. I put the book down for a few days. I live in the Basin and Range and wanted to know about the geology of my new home, so I tried again. After a few pages of the second chapter, I quartered it, ten pages at a time. Ripping is good exercise for the fingers. McPhee just doesn't know where to stop, using 10 examples where a good author would have used 2 or 3, and a great author would have used one.I'd appreciate pointers to other books on the basin and range, specially ones by authors who are not so full of themselves.A bit of irony: I noticed as I was piling the quarters of the book a blurb on the back in which Steven Jay Gould called McPhee succinct."
3,All over the place,"McPhee's book of the Basin and Range is kind of all over the place. For books of this nature (educational/nonfiction), I prefer more concise and predictable books that let you know where they are going. I don't know why he doesn't divide his book into chapters. And it's hard to conceive a book that attempts to talk about geology without a single illustration. Very strange. There were a few discussions that I found fascinating. But of the 215 pages, those discussions totaled about 40 pages. The rest is filled with McPhee's attempt at poetic prose that I feel distracts from what the focus should be, the Basin and Range."
3,Ok,These were just ok... I could never get them tight enough...They began to not work well after a couple months... the color faded...every time I used them I would need to loosen them and put them back downand tighten them up .. again... over all.. ok.. but not great
2,Chrome plateing fades fast and tie downs don't hold much weight.,I have tried three other brands of tie downs on different trucks that I have owned and purchased these because they looked great. The installation was a pain and they are engineered poorly. When I put a load on them they pulled partially out of the truck bed hole and weren't very secure. The black chrome finish faded in less than 6 months and now looks terrible. I would recommend a different brand tie-down and save your money.
2,Another failure to deliver,"Many authors of erotica deals with the theme of a girls school with mainly lesbian sex and ""classical"" spanking dicipline. This should at least set higher standards for any new attempt to use this setting. However, also in this novel, we see a lot of spanking, followed sometimes by briefly descibed sex- secenes (a few good exceptions, though), but no deeper feeling of attraction and compassion between the dominant and submissive participants. These feelings ARE described, but one feels that they are used more or less as an excuse to go on with the punishment.the setting and the theme is very exciting, but this one did not deliver!"
3,It Takes Discipline to Finish it,"A disjoint work of mainly lesbian domination. Although relatively well written in terms of grammar and use of the language, there just isn't a coherent thread through the work. Much less interesting to read than the two previous works by the same writer. It gets three stars only because the writing and language usage are above average. The story development is lacking, one would have wished for more involvement by the character Barat, but this was not to be. The ending was essentially telegraphed at the beginning, thus ""relieving"" the reader of suspense (and a lot of interest as well)."
1,Dont get this book,"This book is really bad. It has very few pictures and is hard to use. If you want to get a guide for this game, then get the Official Nintendo Player's Guide. This guide is much better and is the one i used to beat both games. The only problem is that amazon.com does not carry any Nintendo plyaers guides."
5,Incredible Greek Clarinet and Vocal,"The number 1 Greek Clarinetist for 30 years, Yiorgo has an incredible tone, and plays beautifully both accompaning female vocals, and solo. Some of the music sounds like Klezmer, some Turkish, and all of it Greek.Great for dance, for belly dance, and to listen to.Opaaah!"
1,Censorship Sucks!,I was at the actual concert and they editied out sooo much. There was a lot of great comics that had good jokes and they are all edited out. There is even some performers that are not on here like JA RULE. I am very disappointed with this DVD and DO NOT recommend it for anyone that was actually there because it is nothing like what the concert was.
4,Daughter LOVES it,"We bought this for our 6 year old, and she loves it. The new design is so much better which gives a very smooth ride. None of our stores carried the red, so I ordered it through Amazon and I'm glad I did. The red is very flashy."
4,Better Than the Original,My 5 1/2 yr old son had the original Razor for years and wanted to do more tricks. The A3 has a wheelie bar and bigger wheels. I actually love riding it too. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is I thought the A3 had a kick stand (saw it on a website) so it didn't have to be laid on the ground when not in use.
5,Superb scooter that it will take time for your child to grow out of,"Perfect -- I got this for my 6 year old and she can ride it until she is 20.Or 30. Seriously -- my wife rides on sometimes and it is fine for her.Don't know if will last that long, but Razors are sturdy.The A3 was worth the extra money.It is about 10 to 20 dollars more than the A and the A2, but ithas bigger wheels, which means it is faster andthe ride is smoother.My daughter had a three wheel scooter before and hadnot problem learning -- she was doing great in an hour.The only complaint I have is about the release switch --it is a little finicky. You have to jiggle it.Also, it would be better if they had more pre-set handlepositions -- they have only one, for someone who is about 5'4'' or more.This is not much of a drawback since you don't need to use a pre-set --the latch is pretty secure. Still, the handle can twist a little at times.My daughter's friends ask to ride hers all the"
3,Nice scooter but not what I wanted,"I thought from the picture that the wheels would be larger but it wasn't....I returned it and got the A5 Lux scooter. Razor makes a wonderful scooter and this was a great price, just not what I wanted."
4,Great razors! Kids love them!,I got 2 Razor A3 for my 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son. They both love them. The bigger wheels make the ride smoother and control easier. They are pretty sturdy and durable. They are light and when folded it is easy to fit them in the trunk.
1,"Razor A3 Kick Scooter, 2006 Version (Blue)","I ordered this scooter for my son as a Christmas present. When it arrived I found it was not the scooter described by Amazon. Both scooters were labeled A3 (Blue), but the one I received did not have the shock-absorbing system or the kickstand, both features my son was looking forward to using. My call to Amazon customer service was unsatisfactory as they had little interest in what could be a ""bait and switch"" tactic. I have returned the scooter.1-6-07 update- Giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt, I ordered the scooter with the kickstand and shock-absorbing system again. The result was the same. The scooter shipped did not match the scooter in the description."
5,Awesome,"Bought this for my son's 4th birthday because he saw all his big kid friends (ages 7+) riding them. Wasn't sure how he'd do on it but the bigger wheels made it perfect! Even the big kids say it's ""way better than their old Razors"" especially because of the new wheels. Great deal too!"
3,All good except it takes to long to ship,"The product has no flaws, its solid, its practical and fast on the street, Plane and simple my kids love it. (5 and 6 year old) The only problem is that this seller takes a wile shipping it. So if you expect it for a specific date order it way in advance."
5,Fun for kids and adults,I bought this for my daughter's 9th birthday and she loves it. I have also had quite a bit of fun riding it around myself! Great product!
5,awesome,love it. I get to and from my college so much faster and save so much time. it's super helpful. :)
5,Great Buy....Great Product,We finally got some warm weather to take my son out riding. He loves his new scooter. It is fast and rides smoothly. He get great exercise while having fun.
2,Not well made,"I had to return two scooters. The last one was okay, but not perfect. These scooters are not well made. They click, when you turn the handle bars. The releasing mechanism is also not strong; it was loose.Razor needs to change the company that is making these scooters for them. The quality is really shoddy.Amazon was very good at accepting all the returns. I must applaud Amazon, but not the scooter."
4,A3 scooter,"I purchased 2 of these -one for a 5 yr old and one for a 3 year old. The kids love to ride them and taught themselves to balance and ride within minutes. I like that the handle bar is adjustable, that there are no tools required for set up, that the scooter folds up for traveling, and it seems all round well made. The only thing I don't like is that the sides of the foot area get worn down easily with only a few scrapes on the pavement and then ankles get cut up a little. Rubber strips along the edges of the foot area would be helpful."
4,More comfortable than the A1,"Pros:1) More comfortable than the A1 due to larger wheels2) Faster than the A1, also due to larger wheels3) Takes bumps + cracks MUCH better than the A1. I feel like the 125mm wheels are the bare minimum for real world use and comfort requirementCons:1) Heavier than the A1. Not by a lot and not enough to be unwieldy, but enough to just be noticeable when collapsed and being carried around.2) Larger than the A1 when collapsed. The stepboard is larger and can't be ""compacted"" further, so no surprises here. It's just large enough to wish it was smaller, but not annoyingly large.3) ""Only"" more comfortable than the A1 by.....if I had to put a number on it, maybe 30%? Significant, and the A1 ride was just annoying to me, so this works.Overall, I'm happy with the build and glad I didn't go for the cruiser, which would be beyond what I would consider to be comfortable and portable to carry around as a commuter."
4,Scooter,The scooter arrived in quick time and was great! My 5 year old nephew loved it and is excited to use it!
5,Razor a3 kick scooter,My son loves this - he especially likes the slightly bigger tires on it. We've had this for a couple of years now and consider it worth the money.
1,received used razor with damage box,"got this for my son's birthday and so disappointed to find the box been opened and damaged. Both wheels shows signs of use. There is also a small dent on the front bar. This is upsetting cause my son's been wanting this scooter. I don't have sufficient time to get him a replacement so I have to keep it!! If item is used or returned, shouldn't Amazon inspect the item before selling it??? or telling the potential customer that the item was a refurbished item??? Disappointed!!"
5,Fast. Nice design,My daughter got this for christmas and loves it. Amazon gave me a break when the price lowered the same day I bought it. Thanks Amazon.
4,Mixed bag,"I bought the A3 for my daughter (5'6"", 120 lbs) to use on campus this fall. She seems to be enjoying herself, especially on fast downhill runs. On the other hand, she says it won't go uphill very well -- I'm lighter (100 lbs, 5'2"") and I'm not finding this to be an issue. Also, I'm fine with the handlebar height, but she would like it to be a bit higher. The scooter seems more stable than the smaller models, and it is very easy to fold (hint: lift the front wheel off the ground slightly before pushing the lever). It's also fairly light and easy to carry.One problem we've just discovered is that some shoes will melt onto the brake once it heats up! Also, it would be nice if the deck were a bit longer, as for adults there isn't really room for your other foot once you get going."
5,Rides well,"The bigger tires of the a3 do seem to give a smoother ride. We got this for our daughter's 5th birthday and she has ridden alot. She can't fold it by herself, but an adult can easy enough."
4,"The kids love it, I don't mind it either, 150 lb limit is correct","The kids love to ride it. I like to ride it also but the 150 lb weight limit should be observed. I'm right around 150 and after riding it and ""freestyling"", it makes noise when anyone rides it."
5,Awesome scooter,"I was debating whether to get my 5 year old son the A2 or A3 and did a fair amount of research. I am so glad I spent the extra 10 bucks or so to get the A3. The wheels are better, smoother, faster ride, and the deck is noticeably bigger than A2 and A1. The scooter is great, my son loves to ride it (and so do I)!!!"
2,Dangerous,"The handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous. Also, the base metal footboard is cracking. I wouldn't spend the money on this scooter. It's not worth it. Spend your money on a cheaper model Razor."
4,Meets high expectations,I purchased this for my 7 year old and it is living up to the high expectations earned by Razor scooters. This is a good value compared to earlier/lower models that go for the same price in other stores.
5,Eerie but worth the watch,This is so captivating to me and Im not sure why. Maybe because it gave me a different perspective on death or something to think about. It is eerie that it seems like she was running from something (death?) and that the camera was recording at the time of her untimely passing.
3,left eye documents her last days,clearly lisa as on some suicide 2pac-biggie type stuff she filmed her burning andre rison's house to going to rehab to going off joining some cult worshipping with some monk dude who really prepared her fro death or to be joined with her master the dark lord she was heavily talking about reincarnation and numerolgy we seen this to her final appearances with tlc and how she joined deathrow I remember that gangster makeover suge knight gave her turned her into n.i.n.a. the original sasah fierce but more gangster check out her deathrow tracks you might like them but anyway this was tragic we saw her die and it looks like she stared into the camera it looks like she crashed the ride on purpose and she did'nt care if she took her protege's with her or not she was determined to be with the dark lord and her destiny was fulfilled beware children.
2,Good only for reference,"This book held a lot of good information as a reference volume, but it made for VERY dry reading. It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed. It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters. I find that by the time I get to a second mention of a myth or regional story, I've forgotten what I read about it in a previous chapter! It is especially not a good book for a beginner just trying to get an overview of older pagan traditions."
3,Good but should have been longer,"I found this book quite interesting but it should have been longer and given more details about myths and symbols. I was brought up being required to read old Icelandic literature at school and I found it astounding that this scholar didn't treat Iceland essentially as a Norwegian sub-colony. Refreshing. Also, if you are interested in old religions and don't want to float in the sea of new age and fancyful imagination this book is a ""not romanticizing, not cynical"" introduction into scandinavian and celtic symbolism. I don't have the diploma to comment on its accuracy."
4,Good Intro to Pre-Conversion Beliefs,"Davidson is a proliferate writer and is very popular for good reason. Her works are generally scholarly- footnotes and references are plentiful- but are written in an easy to read manner.Myths and Symbols deals with the similarities found when comparing pre-conversion Germanic and Celtic religious beliefs and the possible explanations for these similarities.The book consists of several sections:Holy places, Feasting and sacrifice, The rites of battle, Land-spirits and ancestors, Foreknowledge and destiny, The Other World, and The ruling powers.The first sections are headed by verses from the Christian Bible that, while apt, seemed a bit out of place. In several instances the reasoning was vague, but my reservations were adequately dealt with in her `conclusions'.Mostly Scandinavian and Celtic lore are examined but a few tidbits from continental and Anglo-Saxon beliefs round out the comparisons drawn."
4,Interesting comparative work,"This work compares Celtic and Scandinavian mythic and iconographic themes. Professor Davidson does an excellent job of covering a limited set of themes and provides a great deal of food for thought.The main areas which are covered are the core elements of religion-- themes relating to the otherworld, festivities, holy places and the like, This work does not attempt a full-scale comparison of myths and religious structures.All and all, I think this book is an important one for students of related topics to have. I gave it 4 stars only because I thought readability could have been slightly improved."
2,My opinion: this conditioner is overpriced.,"I gave this conditioner 2 stars because it does lightly de-tangle hair as advertised. I am very unhappy with the underlying medicinal-herbal scent. I do not believe this conditioner is worth the $18.00 price charged for it. Lather, Inc.: can't you pretty up the smell?"
4,"Good, but not the best","These are good for the price. However, there are other(albiet more expensive) options that are brighter. This being said, these work quite well during bright daylight."
3,SELECTION COULD HAVE BEEN BETTERED,"This is a bit of a disappointment, first because it contains only 18 tracks, and secondly because the net could have been cast wider to bring in more obscure but no less meritorious pieces. Since one of the stated goals of Memphis Archives is ""to preserve our rich American musical heritage"" one is entitled to assume that this would have been the basis of the compilation. But it's the case that many of these recordings have been reissued in both LP and CD format many times, ""In A Mist"" in particular. Be warned also that Jess Stacy's performance of ""Flashes/In the Dark"", which is a single performance, has been incremented on the CD, thereby throwing out every subsequent track, and misleading Amazon into showing 19 tracks."
3,"Great Players, Tame Results","Nothing wrong here, but it just doesn't add up to much. Lots of famous pianists who apparently had some off days, and a few minor figures I've not heard before. And including some unknown pieces here which deserve to remain unknown. Old recordings, with lots of surface noise; they just amble along until they're done. Not much fire, not much tension, not much pungency. Pleasant background music, but not really listenable. I was hoping to find some buried treasures, but mostly found sand. And if Track 11 (rather than 12) is St. Louis Blues, it is the most personal interpretation I've ever heard."
1,Terrible in many ways,Have had this for two years but won't upgrade cause I'm cheap.Pro-Looks niceCons-Not badger hair! This is made out of really stinky boar hair-Hair falls out. Not a shave goes by where I don't end up with at least 6 hairs on my face.-After two years (but not much use) it less than 1/2 the hair left.I'm finally upgrading and this is going in the thrash.
2,What a sad and empty life,"Growing up I read through Henry Miller's trilogy Sexus, Nexus and Plexus and Tropic of Cancer/Capricon and finally The Rosy Crucifixion. So I am inured to this kind of narrative: debauchery, drinking and ramblings on just about any topic.The difference between Gutierrez and Miller is that the latter had a deeply philosophical bent that at some level gave the books heart, whereas stripped of that, as in Gutierrez's case, leaves you with a life devoid of anything other than sex and drinking. And we all get past that stage once we get into our adulthood.I guess that Mr Gutierrez is still stuck in his 20's. For a man in his sixties to be behaving in this manner is not exciting and interesting but empty and pathetic.If this was my life I wouldn't make it past 25."
3,I bought these for my mother who is a diabetic.,"My mother who is a diabetic uses this brand of test strips. She finds the machine that uses them very easy to use, so she repeately uses them."
2,Completely inaccurate,"I've been diagnosed with a high resting blood sugar, which, of course, I would like to control ASAP. Part of my strategy was to monitor my sugar level throughout the day to give myself feeback on the the effect my diet was having on my BS level. Ergo, the monitor. My level was all over the place from 95 to 185. Very distressing. So I ran my own little test on the monitor. At the same time I tested my level twice. The first time it was 185, very high. Thirty seconds later, I tested again, and it was 95! How can i use this info? I throw away the strips and meter, a complete waste of time and money."
1,Enough rope,"As a person on the ""other side"" of the so called culture war, I applaud books like this. It makes the argument of those striving for reason over faith so much easier to demonstrate, especially when directed at those in the middle. It's this type of rhetoric that makes it so much easier for authors such as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and the late Carl Sagan to get their points across. The main point being that those who still subscribe to the fairy tales and delusions of revealed religious faith are a dangerous anachronism."
3,Terms for War,"This is the first book I've read by the philosophy professor. It is not what I expected... in language. I did expect the Christian perspective. The book's tone is certainly not academic; it is as rhetorical as politics on TV, full of sound bytes.Kreeft writes of issues that are the battles of the culture war: abortion, promiscuity, academics, the media, but puts them into the Christian perspective of a war waged by Satan. Kreeft makes no apologies for his terms of warfare; he realizes there will be those who would prefer a retraction because the belief in Satan is extreme in their systems, including those of some Christians. Kreeft emphasizes the need for the Christian value of sex at the base of so many issues. Abortion, contraception, and the sexual revolution have devalued sex, and thus the family. As to how to win the culture war it is a call to become saints, first by giving oneself wholly to God, then by acting, not thinking about it."
4,"Solid Tie-In, Well Told","Sure, there's not a lot of depth and complexity here, but the book feels like an episode of the show. The characters sound right, the narrative is clean and well-paced, the plot fits in to the time period and level of complexity of the show, and, more importantly, the characters act in accordance with their characters on the show. Some tie-in writers mess up on one or more of the above, but this one get's it right and if you are reading reviews of Buffy books, isn't that what you are looking for?"
3,Great addition,This is a plastic colored faceplate that replaces the plastic colored faceplate on your Garmin. This is a great addition and customization for your gps especially if several people have them. The only down side is there isnt more color options. They should have collegiate color pack or let you order them in specific colors.
5,Gives nice custom touch to your navigation!!,It fits like a glove on my Garmin C330. It gives it a nice custom feel. Im using the red one to match my red Mustang.
4,Surprised.,"When I first saw this language series surface in my local bookstore, I was annoyed and skeptical because of all the emerging language books and gimicks which make false promises. But I hadn't seen this series before, and I wanted to see if was anything like what they said it was. After all, it was published by NTC (publisher of the Teach Yourself series.) After a few minutes of listening to this CD I was no longer skeptical. But there is one very serious pitfall; in the course you are learning along with two other people, a male and a female student. The male student is very annoying, hence 4 stars, and not 5."
3,INTERESTING METHOD,"IT WOULD BE A GREAT COURSE EXCEPT FOR THE ANNOYING FUMBLING AND MISPRONUNCIATION OF THE MALE STUDENT ON THE TAPE. IT'S EXCRUCIATING LISTENING TO HIM WHILE THE FEMALE STUDENT IS QUICK AND CLEAR. THOMAS HAS THE VOICE OF A MAN ABOUT 6O TO 65 YEARS OLD, BUT HE REPEATS THE WORDS FREQUENTLY AND FAIRLY CLEARLY. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE HE KEPT THE MALE STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE SERIES. I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE SET IF I HAD HAD A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO THE STUDENTS. I HAVE STUDIED SPANISH, GERMAN AND RUSSIAN, SO HAVE LITTLE TOLERANCE FOR LISTENING TO OTHERS FUMBLE REPEATEDLY."
1,Did no one else pick up on the fact that the heroine rapes the hero?,"I am shocked that no one else mentioned this. Now, I recognize that the heroine was desperate, and had been sexually tormented by her late husband, so maybe she didn't really understand proper sexual conduct, but still! The hero turns her down, numerous times, so what does the heroine do? She arouses him in his sleep and has sex with him while he's still semi-conscious and doesn't realize what's happening until it's too late. Sick! Just because a man is physically aroused doesn't mean that a woman has his consent. HE SAID NO. End of story!Picture it this way--if a woman had said no, would it be okay if a man had sex with her while she was sleeping? Didn't think so."
2,Not what I expected,"I would have expected a heroine less plagued by the past tormenting sexual experiences, one that knows more about the world. Serena is merely a child, although she is about 24, and she has the skills of a mistress. I found it distressing that the heroine could not enjoy pleasure, but only give, on account of 8 years of continuous ""training"" by her previous abusing husband.I would have also expected the hero to be more experienced, but instead he is clearly lacking. Both characters seem to be struggling with their problems in what makes a very long plot.I would have expected both Serena and Francis to be stronger, strong-willed characters, with more sense of the world and more cleverness.Overall, I didn't enjoy this book because it probably lacked what the books from the ""Malloren World"" have: wit, adventure, passion, strong-willed characters, tension and fun. But then again, maybe I should not compare the Mallorens with the Company of Rogues..."
3,Very Confusing!!!!,"In Begining, the story drags alot. It's very confusing since it's jumping from one plot to the other. It's just doesn't fall into place till the middle of the story. This is the first book I read about The Rouges and it's captured my interest... Serena is well portrayed and Francis is very well protrayed also.I recommend this book and to better understand this book you must read about the other Rouges also."
3,It was okay,"After reading An Unwilling Bride, there was really no competition. However, that thought aside, it was not what I expected. Francis, while reading An Arranged Marriage, was my absolute favorite rogue. I honestly had thought he would receive a better story. He only ever thinks anout Serena's looks, though he thinks monstrosities of her all the while. Francis had more genuine and respectable feelings for Eleanor, i think, than for the supposed love of his life. This book ws pretty painful to read. I feel that Jo Beverley describes Serena as a much better person than Francis ever knows her to be. I initially thought Francis to be the most genuine of the rogues and I felt him disapointing me several times through out the book. Where does this book redeem itself to deserve three stars? At the end, when serena shows resistance. That last scene left me at piece with the book, although this was not one of my favorites. :/"
2,Disappointing Rogue!,I have read most of the rogue series and not necessarily in the sequential order. Most of the books have been spot on and engaging. But here is the exception. I found the premise contrived! The book caught my interest in the beginning but lost me half way thru the story. The lead female character Serena was strong enough to survive a previous humiliating and tortuous marriage yet becomes a whining victim when she meets the man of her dreams. Why? I felt that the writer had a terrible editor who failed to edit the book properly. The story becomes too long and monotonous. Also the love scenes were ridiculous!
4,4 1/2 stars. Did Francis ever tell Serena he loved her?,One thing that bothered me - is at the end Serena says she loves Francis but as far as I can recall he never said the words to her.I have read all the Rogue books to date and I really like them all! Even though - I really doubt in reality that Nicholas and Lucien would be faithful husbands. Lucien getting turned on by watching Francis and Serena fight - was a little much. I think the men wouldn't mind sharing their wives or their mistresses.Okay after all of that though - I am completely addicted to the series and can't wait to read the rest.
5,Great blues lesson,"I have had this video on VHS for years, wore it out. This is essential viewing for anybody interested in the blues. After you watch it research Willie Dixon,he wrote a hundred songs. Some for Chuck Berry."
5,I couldn't put it down!!!,"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I literally couldn't put it down, even for sleep. My husband had to almost tear the book out of my hands before I could bring myself to put it down. I found Robin Stone very sympathetic as he had trouble with relationships until he confronted his past, and the fact it was ok to have a normal relationship, and even that he could *need* a woman. Until then, he was just running away with himself and he was using the network and his lecture ciruit to drown himself and avoid the fact that his relationships with women were not normal. It took me to emotional extremes and the pacing was fantastic. I usually don't find books that exciting to get all emotional over, but this was one of them. I am looking forward to reading her other books as well. Thank you"
2,How naive are some men,"The first two parts of the book are great, the story of Amanda and Maggie, but the last part is boring and boring, everybody who read this book have to know that Robin will never do anything with Judith.How Judith's husband never knew anything? If you are the president of any big company the first thing that you have to do is to have your eyes open, with your wife and with anybody, here JS put Judith's husband as a stupid naive, and that kind of persons can't be the president of anything.I can't tell you that this could be real or not, but how many times a man can deceive a woman and at the end that woman (Maggie)will return to him (Robin), the same end was in the Valley of Dolls and I didn't like it either."
4,"Entertaining, but not as addictive as VALLEY OF THE DOLLS","If you are considering buyig this book, you are probably looking for the same addictive trashy fun that you found in Valley of the Dolls. Well, it's addictive, though it may not be great literature (come on, it's not supposed to be), but it definitely doesn't supersede its infamous predecessor.First of all, it is NOT a sequel, though it is also about the moguls of show business. The characters in Valley of the Dolls were far more intriguing-- I felt like I really knew them. In The Love Machine, you learn a lot about a certain character, and then all of a sudden they disappear from the book. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book to anyone who couldn't put down Valley of the Dolls-- it'll keep you coming back for more, just don't expect the same thrill."
5,Nobody does it like Jackie!,"So it's not Shakespeare, but it's just as dramatic! Grittier than J.S.'s others, The Love Machine glides thru Robin Stone's relationships with three women in the TV industry: the beautiful and tragic Amanda, the beautiful and gutsy Maggie, and the once-beautiful and desperate Judith with microwave-boiling scandal and intrigue. I can only ditto everyone else's praise, but will add that it should be re-read for its treasury of campy wit, i.e. when Christy Lane says, ""I don't want a beauty queen, I want a **cker! Get me Ethel!"""
4,The Love Machine,"This book was good, but lacked something valley of the dolls contained. However the insatiable need to devour this book was still there as was with Valley. I found this book hard to put down and an enjoyable read, yet I felt the ending lacked something...it seemed too abrupt and all the calamity caused in the final moments of Robin Stone's glory just seemed to vanish. I mean I'm sure the glittery world of network television is fickle...but not that much so"
2,"I hate writing reviews like this, but it was disappointing.","Thankfully, I bought this at a used bookstore and did not pay full price for it. I read Valley of the Dolls the first time a few months ago and was absolutely thrilled with it. Now upon reading this one, I wasn't expecting Valley of the Dolls revisted, but it really wasn't up to par. Valley of the Dolls is a trashy, compelling romp. I found Robin Stone one dimensional and solipsistic, with a bunch of silly, boring females fawning over him.If you are a die-hard Jacqueline Susann fan, you might want to borrow it from the library before purchasing it. Otherwise, don't bother. I'm half-way through Once is Never Enough, and it is much better."
3,2007 Caravan,Good deal compared to local chain stores and received the rotors in just a few days. These are made in China. Seem like decent quality and I cannot tell if these are any better than economy stuff. Time will tell.
5,THIS IS THE BEST!,I really like this c.d. and it has his two best songs on it. Angel and it wasnt me
1,AN UTTER WASTE OF TIME,"First, this is not a movie...it's just a bunch of different people (mostly gay/lesbians) talking about an old case where 2 high school girls committed a planned murder of one of their mothers (because as they saw it, she stood in the way of their being able to stay together instead of one of them moving away to another continent).The only good thing about this in my opinion, are the few landscape shots of the area. The rest is simply a 5-10 minute not so noteworthy story dragged out for FAR too long! It really was a total waste of time and even if you might think you'd be interested in it from morbid curiosity or from some gay/lesbian angle...there's nothing there. Speculation they might be lesbian but then again, possibly just very close schoolgirls. [who cares?]"
5,Helpful for MAV Design,I found this book extremely helpful for information while recently working on my senior design project at the Rochester Institute of Technology. As of winter 2002/2003 there is very little liable information on micro air vehicle aerodynamics available free through technical papers and other readings that I could find. After looking for information for nearly a month I purchased this book and had several of my questions on MAV design and applications answered. This book is primarily a collection of AIAA and university MAV technical papers. I would recommend this book to any college student or professor working on a MAV related project.
1,It's ok,"This book is nothing more than a compendium of AIAA papers. They were collected from a MAV conference hosted at Notre Dame in 2001. Therefore, the papers are all 10+yrs old, the topics are all over the map, and most can now be downloaded for free. I was disappointed to find this as a collection of AIAA papers, most of which I currently already have printed out in a research binder I keep for my PhD research work. I thought this was going to be more of a unified text book, but it is just a bunch of AIAA conference papers. At over $100, PASS on this."
5,"Live, Tender, and Beautiful","I have virtually every Elvis concert recording--the vinyl--from this comeback, or mature, period of his career. So it's from that perspective that I say this is a very thoughful, and fantastic, selection of live recordings from the period launched by the 1968 NBC special and the Las Vegas performances that followed. The collection belies the voluminous studio records from this period, including the considerable body of gospel recordings. However, I'm not familiar with another single disc that captures so many of the most beautiful popular songs and ballads he performed, with signature lush orchestral arrangements, while at the peak of his vocal talent. Had this recording been released at double its list price, it would be worth it. It's a collection worthy of both new Elvis fans and those listening for years."
5,Maggie R Elvis fan,"Can't ever go wrong with Elvis, the CD arrived as promised and in excellent shape."
3,The Waiting Heart by Marcia Miller,"Description from the book back cover:As usual, when covering a wedding for the women's page of the San Francisco Globe, Gilyan Barr sat in church dreamily picturing herself as the bride and tall, handsome Jay Hanover as the groom. Was it only a week since Jay told her he loved her ... only yesterday that he'd left to cover the World Series? Then comes the news that Jay has eloped with very rich, spoiled Nancy Covington - a woman who changed husbands as she changed fur coats. Gilyan told herself to forget Jay, but how could she when her heart kept whispering that he was the only man she could ever love?"
2,this cd player skips like crazy whenever you move,"i bought this cd player not only to listen to cds at home but also when i went out for a walk. boy did it frusterate me when with each move of an arm or leg the thing skipped. the only way i can enjoy any music is if i am sitting perfectly still. do not buy this if you are going to be using it to walk or jog. yes, the outside is pretty and the price is nice but looks fooled me don't let if fool you."
3,Skips a beat,The portable cd player is fine for sitting and listening to CD's. If you're walking around your songs will skip.It also took me a minute to figure out how to put the batteries in. The instructions are backwards.
2,"Eh, OK I guess","Outside of the tiny buttons that don't work very well, the tiny display that's really difficult to see except in the best light and the fact that it skips with every little bump, I guess it's good.Spend a couple of dollars more for a player that has an anti-skip memory."
1,lousy merchant,The Coby CD player was defective ! the merchant would not take it back or issue a refund....I will not purchase from the merchant or Amazon again ! I'm done !
5,A reality show for readers,The most exciting 355 pages in print. Hollywood and NY entertainment industry as it really was and is; better than any movie ever made. Real stories that you have never heard before which will make you jaw drop and will force you to keep both eyes open.
4,SECOND CHOICE REISSUE FOR THIS PERIOD OF THE BAND,"For seekers of early hot dance bands, this CD is a good companion to the Timeless reissue, which covers 1922-1926, since the two contain only one duplication, namely Farewell Blues. But it is somewhat short measure in comparison, with five less tracks, and there is less in the way of documentation. Therefore I'd place it in second place to the other, and the four star grading reflects that."
4,Green day's underrated 2nd album is worth a 2nd listen,"I'll admit that on the first listen, Kerplunk was a disappointment. I found it to be not as catchy or well-written as later albums such as Insomniac. However, Kerplunk is a great display of Green Day's early punk energy, and the lyrics are infused with emotion, alternating between brutal honesty and poetic cliches. There is a diverse array of material, from the typical anthem ""2000 Lightyears Away"", to the almost emoish ""One for the Razorbacks"", ballads ""Christie Road"" and ""No One Knows"", incredible punk rock ""80"", ""One of my lies"", and ""Private Ale"", poppy, retro-sounding ""Words i might have ate"", and an early version of ""Welcome to paradise"" that should have made Green day's imminent success evident to any listener. the only setback: the ep tacked onto the end, which is made up of several similar-sounding songs that get very repetitive."
5,classic green day,"I have all of Green Day's albums and this is by far one of there better records! Despite what people thought of Dookie (funny hair and cartoons) Billie Joe Armstrong writes some of the best songs I have ever heard! Instead of writing about girls, dating,ect. He writes about being a confused teenager,his wife,being lazy, and life in general. Tre' Cool who joined the band in 1991 as there drummer writes a song called Dominated Love Slave, his country tunes are so hilarious your sides hurt from laughing so hard! They even let him sing! Green Day's sense of humor make the music even more enjoyable to listen to. This is ART people and I'm not saying that just because I'm a fan but because I'm a musician myself and I know what good music is. BUY THIS ALBUM!! IF YOU WANT A GOOD ROCK ALBUM, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!!!!!! 2,000 Light Years Away is the best song!!!!"
2,Rushed,"Kerplunk! came after 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, before Green Day hooked up w/ Reprise Records, so it's gonna be low quality. The vocals on some of the songs are goofy and unprofessional sounding (Best thing in Town being an example. Can't even understand Billie Joe). So, I wouldn't recommend buying it. Get a bootleg or download it, 'cause this is low quality, neglecfully put together stuff."
5,My 2nd favorite Green Day,"I don't think this album is as good as 1039 smoothed out slappy hours, but it is one of their best. Green Day did their best work on Look Out records. All of their stuff is good but none of it really compares to their first 2 albums."
3,"""2000 LIGHT YEARS AWAY"" IS THE BEST!","What can I say? ""2000 Light Years Away"" is the best song I've ever heard from Green Day."
5,Best Band= Green Day,Kerplunk is a great cd. I reccommened it to anyone who likes any of Green Day's other cds. Dominated Love Slave is a really great song and there are lots more on the cd that are cool too.
5,Kerpunk is Green Days Best,"This Album is, in my opinion, the best album Green Day has ever made. It introduced the new drummer, and current drummer, for green day.... Tre Cool. Kerplunk is the first album his awesome drumming apeared on. Before the fame, before the money, that is where Kerplunk was. It is a definate need for any Green Day fans. If you like Green Day and want to get away from all the stuff on the radio 24/7... then buy Kerplunk. It will make you twice the fan you already were."
5,Very happy...,I know that I like a lot of Green Days music and own plenty of it. This cd doesn't have a whole lot of the hits on it but loved it nonetheless.
5,I take that idiotic rating back. This album rocks.,"It's weird, but this album sort of grows on you. I love this album and I listen to it alot. I love the songs ""No One Knows"" and ""Christie Road"". This album sooooooooo cool. I also like, oh forget it. Every song rocks the entire world. Billie Joe's voice sounds different then his new one, and I kind of like it like that. Almost as good as Dookie, and wipes out Nimrod. Spectacular album."
3,My real rating is three-and-a-half stars.,"It's certainly is recognizable as Green Day. Kerplunk's sound isn't as hard and strong as Dookie or Nimrod. However, the guitar solos are better then Dookie's. Kerplunk is not Green Day's best album, but it isn't disapointing. A good album, but it isn't Green Day at their best."
3,My Adventure with Green Day...,"Green Day's 2nd album was more punk and less pop than Dookie or anything since. This CD contains the original version of ""Welcome to Paradise"" without the radio-friendly sheen. They also cover the Who's ""My Generation"". Plus the liner notes include a hilarious story called ""My Adventure with Green Day"" by Laurie G. It's about a teenage girl who murders her parents to go on the road with Green Day. If all CD's had stories like these there would be less downloading. But as good as this album is, I miss the polish of their latter albums."
3,Green Day Rules!,"I thought this CD was great. It's one of their older CDs, but I guess its better than the American Idiot CD. This CD's best tracks are #4, #6, and #8."
1,Horrifying PLEASE READ,"There is a story entitled My Adventure With Green Day in the little book. It is a disturbing story of a girl who puts her parents on drugs and chops them up with a butcher knife and throws their bones in the trash. There is lots of swearing, explicit content, and Green Day thought it was cool that the girl killed her parents to meet them. Luckily, this girl is arrested until 2019. The track aren't even that wonderful. [...]"
1,I totally regret buying this cd.,"If i could rate this cd any lower I would.this cd is so incredibley bad.the day i got this cd i bought 2 other green day cds (nimrod and insomniac) which were pretty good then i opened kerplunk. it was so bad!!! it was so ignoying with its low-fi sound.it's just not punk enough!!! green day used to be my favorite band for a long time then i just got so sick of them.their only really good cds are dookie and insomniac the rest really [stink]. there are a lot of better bands out there than green day like sugarcult, new found glory,less than jake, midtown,the vines,the white stripes,rage against the machine and much much more. hell, even blink has better cd's than this one and thats pretty damn sad. this cd is not worth your money at all. so all in all i rate this cd a -10 out of 5 stars. P.S. sorry about my spelling."
1,I am SUPRISED!!!!,"Green Day Rocks!But this...THIS IS THE WORST GREEN DAY ALBUM EVER!!!Get International Superhits,American Idiot,Warning,Isnomanic,Nimrod,Dookie BUT NOT THIS!!!!!"
5,Green Day,"1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours:very good album, with lots of good songs, with hardly any bad 1s.Kerplunk:also a very good album, and i recomend buying it cos it is all just classic green day all the way through.Dookie:probably green day's best album, with all their biggest hits on it.Insomniac:this is a very different album to all the others with only a few classic albums, but 1 song which is diff.(brain stew) is amazing!Nimrod:probably my favourite album of the lot, cos it has a mixture of classic green day right through quiet green day and screamin' green day.Warning:i think this is probably the worst album of the lot, with only a few good songs.International Superhits:this album really somes up green day very well, but the only problem it has is that it misses ome good songs out like 86, castaway.so that is my review, u might or might not disaree with it.if u hav anything 2 ak e-mail me at ghostly_trio@hotmail .com"
3,Call me a ...,"Let's see. From the majority of reviews, it seems that most people think Green Day's pre-Dookie albums are their best. Not true. Don't get me wrong, Kerplunk is great and I love it, but in my opinion their earlier stuff isn't as good as their Reprise releases. They still haven't found their hooks yet. Kerplunk is wonderful, but it doesn't flow as well as Dookie through Warning. There are some songs that are some of the best in Green Day's history, but the rest feels rushed. My favorites include Christie Road, Private Ale, 80, and Who Wrote Holden Caulfield. Wonderful songs. The last two songs from the Sweet Children release are extremely bad, but they're some of their very first songs so you can't blame them.Kerplunk is a LOT different from Warning. There is a certain raw sound on this release. It certainly is good, but it's not amazing."
3,ok,I have been listening to Green Day forever. I had this years ago and lost it. When American Idiot came out I remembered I used to like it and I still do.
2,All right now and then!,I was on a skiing trip in Austria and one of the girls i knew liked Green Day and she only had Kerplunk to my suprise i could not stop listening to it all the way home. But then i bought it a month after i had listened to it and i didn't like it as much i think you will love it when you first buy it but you grow to hate it i did.
5,Solid school behavior plan!,"This book appears to be a complete package for developing research-based behavioral interventions in an elementary or middle school. It uses familiar elements, like a behavioral goal sheet and award tickets, but it adds the check-in/check-out procedure for starting and ending the child's day. It also has a parent component, requiring the parent to sign and return the behavior report card everyday. The directions for setting up these interventions are very complete. In addition, this book helps you problem-solve the potential pitfalls of these interventions, and shows you how to add a more formal functional behavior assessment to help adjust the plan for children who do not respond well. I cannot say ""it works"", as I just purchased the book, but having considerable experience in designing similar behavior plans, I predict good results."
1,Writing Isn't For Amateurs,"This is one truly awful read. The writing is boring, amateurish, and totally without art. The author, supposedly the great grandson of the protagonist, is an educational consultant in Texas, and he has apparently decided to share his not so interesting family history with the world. Well, some family histories are really not that interesting, and few educational consultants are known for their prowess as writers.After viewing the truly God-awful film of the book (by the author's highly untalented daughter) in Alice Texas, I picked up the book almost as an exercise in masochism. I was not disapointed, every paragraph was indeed tortuous and made me want to scream ""enough!"" Sorry to have to pan both the book and the movie, but I do so in the interest of the public."
1,I would give ZERO stars if there was that rating!!!,"Some of the other reviewers have left out songs that was omitted in the recording, the concise list of songs that wasn't in the recording is below:Marin Mazzie: Bewitched Bothered BewilderedAudra McDonald: Down With LoveDee Hoty: Could I Leave You?Rebecca Luker: Falling In Love With LoveKaren Ziemba/Bebe Neuwirth: Hot Honey RagKaren Ziemba: I Wanna Be A RocketteNell Carter: Ain't MisbehavingAnna Kendricks: Life Upon the Wicked StageLea DeLaria: encore to I Can Cook TooJennifer Holliday: intro to And I'm Telling You I'm Not GoingTony Roberts/Robert Morse: The Beauty That Drives A Man Mad (I suppose it's leading ladies, so this one omitted is okay)So as you can see it's quite a rip off version of the DVD, so don't buy it, right-d-o?"
2,What Happened?,"I was looking forward to buying the My Favorite Broadway CD after seeing the PBS broadcast. I was so disappointed when I received the CD. Could they possibly leave off any more? The cut out so many of the great songs and left all of the old dead ones like ""And I'm Telling You"" and ""Adelaide's Lament"". How often do we have to hear those songs? The worst part is how many great songs were left off like Marin Mazzie's ""Bewitched"" and Karen Ziemba in ""I Wanna Be a Rockette"". Above all the most missed is Audra McDonald singing the incredible ""Down With Love"". Of course there were some great songs like Webber Love Trio and ""Nothing"" sung by Priscilla Lopez, but there were just to many things taken out. My advice is skip the CD and go for the video. You wont miss anything that way."
1,Half Of Those Songs Are Not On The CD,"I would just like to tell the person that wrote Over All A Great Compilation the reason why this CD Is bad is because many of the songs you mentioned are not on the CD. Rebecca Lucker is no where to be found on it and Marin Mazzie's Bewitched was one of the best songs of the concert and it is not on there. Karen Ziemba's I Wanna Be A Rockette was probably the greatest number in the whole show but funny, it's not there eather. So Yes like that reviewer said these people gave great preformances but unfortunitly that person forgot to mention that all of the numbers were left off the CD."
1,The MP3 Download link is a mistake,"As of 2/14/11, if you click on the MP3 Download option for ""My Favorite Broadway - the Leading Ladies"", what you get is a completely different album titled ""Leading Ladies"". Entirely different music, entirely different singers. BEWARE!"
4,Good way to improve your chess,"I rated this product with 4 stars. I believe this is a good book and if one tries hard he will gain from it. The one thing i didn't like is the fact that the author hasn't checked the variations with a chess program, like Rybka or Fritz. So when you find a perfectly good move suggested also by the above mentioned programs, the author gives maximum points at another move. So 4 instead of 5, but all in all a good investment."
2,What's the Deal?,"This is a three star book that I am giving a two because of the other glowing reviews on it. I don't see the big deal about this book. The author did give some good annotated games, but seriously! All it is a tactics work book! I would consider this book good for a bit of tactics training, but I wouldn't call it a chess 'Self-Improvement' handbook."
1,updated information in Information for Reader,"On pages xxvii and xxviii of the Information for the Reader section of Clare and Her Sisters, a Catholic lay association called the Brothers and Sisters of Penance is mentioned and contact information given. That group has been refounded as the Confraternity of Penitents with a new web site at http://www.penitents.org The web site and one of the addresses and emails mentioned in the book are used by another group whose name and Rule are similar to but yet different from the original vision which is being followed by the refounded organization called Confraternity of Penitents. Thank you for allowing me to provide this updated information."
3,A systematic and easy way to learn the Korean Alphabet.,"I purchased the above book about six years ago during my pursuit and interest into Asian Languages. Personally, I thought that it helped in presenting the written fonts of hangul and hancha in very basic steps. It aided in my development of being able to grasp and associate various characters with ease. Compared to other self study books used I would have to definitely give this book a 4.5 star rating for the development in grammatical context. For the speaking ease I would have to give a 3.5, yet with consistent pronounciation drills and the marvels of todays internet being able to pronounce the characters being presented will make more sense now than ever before."
1,Save your money. Read the original.,"If you're reading this review, you can download the texts of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rest of the amendments for FREE! The original texts are actually MUCH clearer than this book's attempts to ""translate"" documents already written in English. There are a few (no more than ten) terms the average sixth grader might need to look up in the actual documents, but that's a much better use of your time than reading this book. Frankly, it is so poorly wrtitten that it is an embarassment to this era. They did a MUCH better job 200+ years ago."
1,If I could rate this less than one I would have!,"Save your money! Don't even bother with this one unless you like listening to director commentary straight through a film. I love indie films more so over mainstream, but Come on Amazon, let it be known that we are in store for director commentary. Film is un-watchable. I wish Amazon had it so that we could at least see more than just the opening credits. It would have saved me wasted money, time and energy!"
1,NOT In Stock,"I ordered the Teacher Kit and got an email from the company indicating that they ""just sold the last one."" They suggested that I wait until they got some more in or ask for a refund. I asked for the refund and it was handled well. However, their product remained on Amazon and continued to state ""In Stock."" I don't understand that!"
4,One Handy Book to have,"I do a lot of programming on the C6000 series. This book is very helpful as a reference and saves you a lot of time. Best part is, you don't have to read it in sequence. You need a certain amount of C programming experience, but you probably already have that if you're using this processor. It has a good coverage of Code Composer and it has what you need to get you up and running quick. Definitely worth it in terms of sheer time saved in optimizing programs. When you're through with this book, you have a better understanding of the processor and an overall better picture on implementing those algos you use so often. Good buy. Maybe not the best, but for the cost - excellent."
2,Not for C6x starter,I'm just writing this to warn starters with C6x not to buy this book. It added nothing to TI documentation that can help me unwrap my SDK.
1,Never had trouble burning cds until this arrived.-,"I used to think all cds were the same because I bought fuji, verbatim, and even LG brand... but when I found 50 CDs for just US$10, I ordered right away. BE WARNED! I even thought my CDRW Drive was messed up when I tried using these, stick to your favorite CDr brand and dont try these!"
5,Romping reflections of Waters!,"A unique biography/filmography for a unique individual. Tackling the complex life of an icon such as John Waters would be anything but simple, yet this author has done just that. Pela reveals all we want to know about Waters early relationships, his film career, and more. It was a great read filled with quirky facts and hilarious recollections from Walters."
4,Poetry by the last great novelist of the 20th century,"This triptych of three long poems by W.G. Sebald is a jewel-like ornament to his four major prose works, ""Vertigo,"" ""The Emigrants,"" ""The Rings of Saturn"" and ""Austerlitz."" I found the first and third poems, dealing with the shadowy German Renaissance painter Matthias Grunewald and with Sebald himself, superior to the second section, on Arctic exploration, but I fully expect other readers to judge for themselves and judge differently. The burning power of what is best in all of Sebald's works is encapsulated in a few lines from the third poem here, describing Sebald's reaction after viewing a painting of the destruction of Sodom in the Kunsthistorisches Museum:When for the first time I sawthis picture the year before last,I had the strange feelingof having seen all of itbefore, and a little later,crossing to Floridsdorfon the Bridge of Peace,I nearly went out of my mind."
2,Best of the three I ordered.,"Of the three Hoosier books I ordered I suppose this one actually had the most information on Sellers brand Hoosier cabinet which is what I was interested in. There were thirty pages of information and old ads on the Sellers cabinet brand. However, that being said I was disappointed in this book. The cover is bright and colorful but there is not one color photo in the entire book! The entire book looks like it was copied on an old copy machine and then thrown together. The original photographs of current cabinets that have been redone are equally disappointing. They are out of focus and of poor quality. They look like someone forgot to use a flash in poor lighting. Some of the pages are very light as if the copy machine was running out of ink! Not a quality production to say the least."
3,Hoosier cabinets,The book was informative. I did not like all of the pics in black and white.I found the web and searching google images more useful than this book.
3,"In a slim field, this is pretty much all there is.","This book was definitely helpful to me; but it didn't expand a whole lot further than the 500+ page manual included with the software. Some additional helpful information on creating appropriate graphics, but I didn't learn a whole lot. I'm waiting for a really good DSP 2.0 book to come out. But until that happens, this is really the best you can do."
3,Lacks some vital information,In his book ver 1.5 Martin covers scripts and play all buttons. However in ver 2.0 he does not cover scripts in the book but has you go to web for that information. Plus he does not cover scripts with enough information to feel you understand it.Feels like he was rushing to get this book out fast and then decided at last minute he left out vital information.
5,jazz-bossa diva,"this was recorded just before isabelle 's lover died (dirk schoufs-vaya con dios) and it's the last time he played doubble bass ,so the drama of that situation makes the album so sad but so beautiful.the last romantic warrior (english title) will forever be..."
2,Review by a Driving Sim junkie...,"Well, maybe my standards are too high in this catagory, but I didn't like Test Drive 6. Or 5, or even 4 for that matter.The cars look good, but they just don't have that thrill of driving that is in other sims. (those who know me know which one I refer to!) The scenery is plain and repetative. Well, I don't like saying too many bad things about a game, so I will end here.Go buy Need for Speed....and no I don't work for Electronic Arts!Spin"
5,Worth its weight in gold....,"ABT in San francisco AND ABT at the Metropolitan...make a verydelightful collection of short, brilliant ballets. Abt inSan Francisco has a very early Baryschnikov dancing 'the poet'in Les Sylvides. It is like watching a flower open. The BlackSwan is dynamic, but my own favorite is ""Great GallopingGottschalk""...toward the end of which Johan Renvall has abrilliant, witty featured solo. Watch for it.Sometimes I get tired of having the TV YELL at me..and I putone or the other of these ABT DVD's on...they are both greatcollections, beautifully performed, and wildly varied. Justgreat music and great dancers...not oblivion, but certainlyserenity."
2,Not getting what I thought,I thought I would be getting a nice big heavy beach towel for this price. It is very thin and not really all that big. Poor value for the money.
4,Classic from Coleman & company!,"Despite being released in 1975 (and in Japan ONLY) with a crazy cover, this isn't a Prime Time recording. It actually dates from 2 Atlantic sessions between 1959-1960 featuring Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, Billy Higgins and Ed Blackwell (Blackwell replaced Higgins in the 1960 sessions). The first portion was recorded during the same studio period of ""Change Of The Century"" and the rest was done shortly after ""This Is Our Music"" recordings. The titles themselves were only given by Coleman just before the record was released.But all this info. can be discovered in the sleeve notes. What makes this all worth while is hearing the music flow out of the speakers and into ears with tremendous joy. Whether you like Ornette's free jazz funk or classic style, check it out. It will not disappoint."
5,Bob Hope,It is great! Really miss seeing him and his stand up comedy! Would buy more of his videos! Really Great!
2,disappointing,This DVD was disappointing. The material is nowhere near Bob's best. Save your money and watch one of his better movies instead.
5,Bob Hope Ultimate Collection,This man is one of a kind.As funny as Johnny Carson.Great DVD for the memories.Quick delivery.Seller A+.
2,Not what expected.,"To my sorrow, it is mostly advertisements of different actors and people appearing on his shows. I hoped for full shows."
1,Disappointing,Morton Gould has written very good music and Betty Comden and Adolph Green have written very clever lyrics. Not this time. From the plot one would expect music that would bite and move. But this music seems limp. I was listening to this in the car and several times I almost moved to the next CD. The lyrics do not reach into the feelings. No toe tapping here.
3,TRIED BRIEFLY,I TRIED THIS FROM TARGET AS MY BOYS AND I LOVE SHAVED ICE. MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A SNOW CONE AND NOT SHAVED ICE. TOO CHUNKY FOR MY LIKING AND I TOOK IT BACK. MY BLENDER DOES A SMOOTHER THOUGH THINNER JOB. WE KEPT THE SYRUPS AND WE LOVE THEM. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE BACK TO BASICS 500.
1,Childish Message,"I think I just plugged into the DNC.When did over-juiced rock bands (and worse) become spokesmen for anybody?I like the rock but not the knock. Just shut up and play music. At eighteen I hardly think you have the experience to speak to anyone or for anyone about much. Come back in twenty years and go into politics. Maybe by then you will know enough to be of worth, but obviously not now. Take R.E.M. with you. I will hold my breath. Just play music and shut up."
1,Total waste of money,"Really just a poorly made syringe. DO NOT get for cats and it is better suited for small horses. ,"
4,Pet pill gun,Every time I pulled this out my chocolate lab took off running. Guess I didn't apply it correctly the first time. Maybe it would work better at the other end.
1,Foreign Object In A Cats Mouth = #Fail,"After reading all of the positive reviews on how easy it was to pill pop your cat, I was thrilled to receive the pill gun and even more excited that I could outsmart my cat while giving her medication. Twenty scratches later and blood spewing all over me and my neighbor, we finally put this to rest and went the old fashion route. Seems this design is somewhat flimsy and difficult to eject the pills to the back of throat then in a split second shut their mouth so the pill doesn't come hurling in your face let alone your cat's fiery rage; claws included. This is definitely a three to four man job, but I encourage you to give it a try."
2,don't like the smell,"I tend to go for products that are environmentally friendly. I like the fact that these wipes don't have harmful chemicals and come very moist. However, the wipes are very thin which makes it hard for grooming a cat with so much hair like mines. Also these wipes have an awful smell. My cat didn't like it and neither did I.I rather use organic or regular baby wipes from the store."
3,A Little Aloha music,Danny's music is not readily available on ITunes or Amazon so you have to purchase the entire CD to get one or two songs you want. Danny would sell a lot of his most popular songs individually if he'd ever wanted to do that.
5,Almost Paridise,Beautiful voice ... great addition to our music collection ... beautiful songs ... strongly recommend
3,Almost Paradise,"Beautiful voice & his island songs(esp.These Islands)are exceptional, but most of the others songs were very popular 70's/disco-ish songs. Reminescent of Johnny Mathis' comeback of the 70's. If you are into that then you will love this album. I would have preferred ALL island/Hawaiian songs instead."
1,Couldn't be much worse.,"If you want to learn Lightwave, tutorials on the web would be better. The voice teaching these lessons is either a text-to-speech engine, or someone who thinks he's speaking to children. If you want to go through the lessons, you will have to copy the contents to your hard drive. The program can't find some of it's files, because they are named incorrectly.Finished lesson 5. Still have not made so much as a box. I know you have to learn a little about the interface first, but this is ridiculous. This program is like a trial before getting the expensive ones. If they are anything like this, avoid them at all costs.I bought Mastering Dreamweaver and Mastering Visual C# at the same time. I don't expect they will be any better."
3,An experience of native American emotions.,"To study the history of the demise of the native Americans at the hands of the white settlers, is to hurt, to hate, to mourn and to wonder. This book, if nothing else, brings those feelings into sharper focus, makes them raw and gives us an insight into the sheer desolation and sense of hopelessness experienced by those Indian victims of so long ago.Though slightly repetitive in it's format and content, it still managed to hold my attention by the solemnity and the wisdom of those true heroes of the wild west.My advice would be, to read such books as, ""Bury my heart at wounded knee"" by Dee Brown, to gain a reasonably comprehensive knowledge of the process of America's ""ethnic cleansing"" policy, prior to reading this book. Following this, you'll be suitably depressed enough to tackle this necessary literary insight into the native American psyche."
2,don't give up on series due to this,I don't get michael moorcock or geln cook -- when on they are some fo best in world -- then they either have ghost written or write a stinker like this -- this book is far from the good stuff of the first 3 and silver spike [which are some fo best fantasy books ever] The next one is sorta blah as well and I'm 80% done with Bleak season which has moments. [sometimes I wish the series was from the perspective of the stump which you will know what I mean when ya read!][hint glen!]I can only hope that things get nicer after bleak...This one can almost be skipped by the callous.
3,it's ok...,"not recommended for shore fishing... boat or pier would be best. would be better if it were wireless. this is best used as a depth finder though not a fish finder. water needs to be glassy also, not chop or readings will be waaay off."
1,arg,"Too bad it was a gift, not opened until the 30 day return-time had elapsed. Works when it feels like it, which is not often."
2,Ice Fishing,"I bought the Nor Cross HawkEye to use ice fishing. It will show if fish are in the area, but I could not tell how close the fish were. The depth finder works great. The see through the ice feature will not work unless you freeze the sensor to the ice. I would much rather use a flasher for ice fishing, but if you only use it as a depth finder it works great."
1,Fish finder,Don't Bother on this one you get what you paid for which is way too much does't work read the reviews
2,Hawkeye fish finder ff3355p,Took too long for delivery. It took two weeks from the day I put in the order. Good for depth finder not sure if the fish signal is correct. Can't seem to catch fish when it show there are fish. The connection is very easily lose connectivity and show no reading on depth. You get for what you pay. It is not really water proof.
4,Compact and easy to use.,Very compact and easy to use with my kayak when fishing. I like that I can use rechargeable batteries than a heavier battery inside of my SOT kayak.
5,The hawleye F33P,"The Hawkeye P33P is a small handheld unit that is accurate, and was easy to read even in bright sunlight. For the money I could recommend it !!!."
5,Can't beat the features 4 the price.,Put in lithium batteries as alkaline does not work well in cold. So far this fishfinder does its job.
2,cheap,"screen doesn't show the actual bottom, not designed to show individual fish(as stated in manual-then whats the point of the finder???) directions show that you need to fish between the boat and the floating sonar...but you cant do a cast/retrieve at that short a distance. this product is not worth the money."
1,doesnt work,dum thing never power up bad service dont buy this product anyonedoesnt even come with the float so no sense buying it
1,Dont buy this,"This really is the worst item I have ever purchased here. It is difficult to see, instructions are impossible to understand, is a waste of money"
3,fish finder,"For its size the price is very reasonable. I found that it worked better for me ice fishing compared to tossing the transponder out in the water from the shore as the weight of the lead caused its position to lean sideways and not stay pointing straight down. When I used it in a boat it worked OK at a slow trolling speed or anchored still, but had a hard time displaying the lake bottom when going 4 mph or faster."
5,hawkeye ff3355p fish finder,Hi I used the fish finder about 6 times so far . It is a great find.I will tell everybody to buy it.I am bring home alot of fish now
2,First day of use.....failed,"First day of use, I took it to Newcastle beach in Washington. Read instruction, powered up and ran simulation. Launched it in water from dock, where I could clearly see the seaweed below about 5 ft. The hawkeye give me ""---"" in depth and no indication of seaweed. Tried many times still the same. It failed to tell depth and identify seaweed in all sentivity, even the water was so clear."
4,Good for a cheap alternative fishfinder,"I bought this for my husband. We are on a tight budget and a ""real"" fish finder is not in it. So far we have used this with out any trouble, we haven't caught any fish, but that could be us and not the products fault. We have used it a few times, there are some design issues that I would prefer to have changed, but for the price it is great."
1,Not for ice fishing,"This unit will read the thickness of the ice fairly well. But whether in the hole, at the bottom of the ice or on top of the ice it doesn't work consistantly. It flickered the correct depth a couple of times but typically it reads (---).If you want something to give you an approximate ice depth, then this is ok. For those who are saying ""WTF?"". It is good to know if you should stay off, walk, or can drive ATV/snowcat or your truck. But don't count on it to tell you how deep the water is underneath or if there is fish there."
3,Good for price I guess.,"I'm from northern Canada and I go ice fishing alot, I purchased this product to see if it could work in 6 foot thick ice. Unfortunately it doesn't work, I think you need 2 feet of ice for it to work. Reading depth is good, but you have to put the sonar on the bottom of the fishing hole for it to work. One day I would like to find fish with it, I tried connecting it to the included broom connector to see if I could find fish by aiming in an angle, it was totally useless, I'm looking forward to next fall to try it out again. I like that I can put it in my pocket when I go out on a lake. Uquuquu!"
4,nice addition,"I'm a pretty simple angler. I just recently bought a kayak so that I could access more fishing environments (rather than being stuck on shore only with limited options, this was my first boat). I like to keep things simple and just wanted a cheap depth/fish finder to play with. I haven't used it a bunch because of my preference for keeping it simple but I must admit when it says there are no fish I never catch one there and the depth reading appears to be pretty accurate from what I can feel with my lures. Plus a few times I've scanned with it and cast to where it said there was fish and I had hits. For sure, not what you want for serious depth graphing, but a nice cheap toy to add to a kayak or canoe that you fish out of."
4,Lake St Clair and Simcoe,"I used this locator on Lake St Clair ( ice fishing) in water about 4-7 ft and as the instructions state...it wont give an accurate fish reading in less than 10 ft. When we used it at Lake Simcoe in Canada, it worked great. When we went to 60 ft of water over 1 ft of ice, it would not give a depth unless I put the gain all the way up. In less than 60 ft (58 ft) Perfect...good depth and fish alert worked great. For the price, this small unit gets the job done."
2,Sad it didnt work all the time,"I was sadden when this product didn't work for me. So I am returning it. Even though I went by what the manual said to do. I was in clear water, new batteries, and as prescribe to do. But never got a depth reading."
4,Decent portable fish finder,I purchased this unit to use on small catarafts. The unit works as advertised. Compact size with several viewing/holding options for unconventional boats. Easy to read display even in bright day light. Depth and bottom structure (weed detection)readings appeared accurate. I did suspect receiving some false readings on the fish detection feature in the top 1 to 2 feet of the water column. Will see if that continues with future use or if that was a glitch with my first time usage.
4,seems very good,"I've only used the fishfinder once, but it performs as advertised. It gave an accurate depth reading, showed some debris (?) on the bottom and displayed an occasional fish. The instructions are pretty good, and it is easy enough to figure out how to set it up and use it. I did have one question. I phoned them, and their customer support person was outstandingly helpful. I only gave four stars because durability won't be evident until I've used it a good bit. But I suspect it will be excellent."
1,Piece of junk broke immediately,Used for two fishing trips which it worked fine for. Now it's completely dead. I didn't drop it or anything it just stopped working.
5,Works!,"I got this for hubby and friends to go ice fishing. They used it twice and both times the reports back were good. They actually saw fish! Don't know that it helped with 'catching' as they only had a fishing license not a catching license. They like it tho, so good review. (And if they liked it it means it was easy to set up and use!!)"
5,Outstanding product.,"I recently purchased a float tube and needed a fishfinder just to know the depth of lakes that I fish, however, I did not want anything heavy or large due to the small space on a float tube. After reading many positive reviews about the Hawkeye F33P I decided that it was exactly what I needed.I took it to the lake and was very happy with the results. It not only gave me the depth but also an indication of the bottom and location of fish. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,you get what you pay for,I use it for ice fishing and it works good except it can not handle the cold tempature for very long. Shipping was very fast (I live in Canada) Good product for the price
1,Want my money back,"This album is garbage. I bought it on a referral because of the special features and guest appearances. I am also an artist so I wanted to hear different production. It is just as crappy as it sounds on the radio. Wack beats, wack raps, wack, wack, wack. I wouldn't even give it one star."
1,"Sony DCR-HC32 MiniDV Handycam Camcorder with 20x Optical Zoom, Handycam Station, & Extra NPFP50 Battery (Purchased on 10/27/2008","Sony DCR-HC32 MiniDV Handycam Camcorder with 20x Optical Zoom, Handycam Station, & Extra NPFP50 Battery (Purchased on 10/27/2008)by SonyI sent back to the seller that camera, because that camera was BROKEN. I do not want to fix that camera.Also that title was not said ""Broken camera"", so please write ""Broken Camera"". If Amazon.com want to sell the ""Broken camera"". I do not want this kind problem. I bought a lot of things from Amazon.com, but this is not good......."
3,Its good,Working perfectly 3 years after I bought it with heavy use. Good quality videos too. Great buy.
5,Excellent product,I used it in my remodelled bathroom - it is just perfect! It created a nice even line (over uneven walls)and matches floor tiles very well.
3,Solid Punchlines,"This EP has solid beats and rhymes but none of the songs have any concepts. They are just straight up bragging, thug lyrics with some real good punch lines but nothing more. If that's what your looking for than the cd is damn solid but otherwise it leaves you dissapointed. The punchlines are damn sick though. With Celph Titled's line in the song Don't You Even Go There stealing the show - ""certified officially, we bring the ill flow/ and make headlines like a corduroy pillow"" - Celph Titled. Esoteric stops by on Captivate/Deactivate to drop a sick verse ending with Apathy asking""yo, esoteric when you bringin the pain son"" Eso responds,""it's probably gettin done as we speak like Jenna Jameson"". Word."
1,Unbelievably bad!!!!,"I watch all kinds of films; classics, westerns, sci-fi, horror, exploitation, you name it. I can usually find some entertaining qualities about anything, but this? The story was absurd, the acting was atrocious, and Anna Faris has absolutely zero appeal as an actress, character, or even as a sex symbol. The only thing the film makers got right was that Faris is the embodiment of what Playboy women have become in recent years; plastic from head to toe, and dumb as a bag o' hammers. In short, life is way too short to waist an hour and a half on crap like this. This makes ""Showgirls"" appear Oscar worthy."
1,Save your money and your time,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Trite is an understatement - dumb blond, wicked enemy,losers becoming winners, they're all there. It isn't even funny most of the time. Though it seemed to be trying to be a female ""Animal House"", it fell flat on its face.Save your money and your time!"
2,Vacuum?,"A hard to believe movie about a girl without a clue or a brainbut a real body, who moves into a college sorority as house motherof Zeta house , the most unpopular house on campus.Full of empty sex jokes and cliches about boobs and butts, this moviehas very little beside visual gags to go on.The acting is minimal dumb blond standard and the plot is predictable.I suppose people will buy it for the giggle and giggle appeal,but it really turned me off."
1,Horrible and boring,This movie was so bad I only made it 3/4 of the way through...and that was only because I thought it HAD to get better. It didn't.
3,ANIMAL HOUSE PART 1000! 3 1/2 STARS!,"OK, haven't I seen this film before? Of course I did!...we have all seen this film before! Ever since 'Animal House' a film that took a group of misfit college kids fighting to save their frat house, Hollywood has been making these films in droves.Regardless Anna Faris is funny and appealing(nudity never hurts these films)in this cute romantic comedy. This reminded me a lot of 'Sidney White' swapping out nerdy boys for nerdy girls. It's harmless and funnier than it should be, but I've seen so many of these films they all seem to run together now."
4,House Of Laughs,"This movie was good, it had several HILARIOUS scenes in it and filled with good comedy. I love movies like Romey and Michelle, Mean Girls, Leagally Blonde 1/2, Bratz, Heathers, Jawbreakers, Clueless, Sweet 16, and countless others...if you like this ""genre"" of stories...you'll enjoy House Bunny...it's not ""The"" best one out there, but it was worth buying to have in my collection...unlike some movies that you'ld rent but not buy....WORTH THE MONEY SPENT for sure!!!"
4,"Will Set Women Back 4,000,000 Years","Just kidding. This is a lighthearted movie. The message? It's okay to be sexy. The other message? There's more to life than being sexy. The idea of ""bunny wisdom"" versus ""geek wisdom"" works along with a lot of verbal humor rather than slapstick. Sure, it plays on well-worn cliches, but it doesn't take itself - or these stereotypes - too seriously. Good fun."
3,Bunny saves college sorority,"3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie House Bunny. A cute story about a girl living at the Playboy Mansion in LA hoping for her big break in the magazine. Another girl tricks her into leaving the Mansion by sending a forged letter from Hef. Ultimately she finds her way to a college and a sorority of the down-and-out girls on campus. With alot of remakes, our Bunny turns the sorority into the cool-place-to-be.Of course a rival sorority attempts to compete. Eventually, Hef figures out what happened and invites her to return. Of course, her heart is now with the sorority.So, why three stars for this comedy. Two stars for the movie and one extra star for the short, sexy outfits and hot girls. Oh, should mention that American Idol near-winner Katharine McPhee has a part in the movie as a very pregnant college girl. OK, it is easy on the brain, great for the eyes and is generally entertaining. Yes, watch it."
2,Predicatable,"If you've seen the previews, you've seen the best parts of the movie. Typical dumb blonde movie; good for a few laughs"
5,Anna Faris nude?,"This movie has some charm even though it's totally predictable. Anna Faris wears practically nothing for most of the movie which I'm totally cool with, she even shows her backside nude. Which if the internet is correct, was actually her and not a body double. This is definitely a movie more for girls, but I wasn't bored and didn't hate it. Plus, female nudity makes a lot of movies bearable for guys. On Blu-Ray this movie looks sharp, muddy at times but mostly has good color and detail. If you can get it cheap, it's a pretty decent movie to have in your collection."
3,Kinda fun . . .,I thought this movie was pretty cute. It's light and predictable but funny and enjoyable. I'd probably watch it again.
5,Bunny in the house,"Our full review is at Mom's Thumb Reviews. But what we do have to say is that this was a surprise. We didn't expect it to be good. We didn't expect it to have applicable lessons that we can learn from. We didn't expect so many great actors and actresses to pull off an awkward to true self transformation. We didn't expect how clean the movie turned out to be language wise, sexuality wise, and crude humor wise.To see what lessons this movie teaches, and to see our full review go to: [...]"
4,Why this movie doesn't suck...,"It's funny. 90% of the jokes work, even if it's not Woody Allen-style humor, OK?Anna Faris has proven herself as a female funnylady, and Emma Stone more than holds her own. Don't hold it against it that it's a Happy Madison production."
3,"Used, as in blockbuster","I purchased this movie knowing it was used. What I didn't know is that it was used as in it used to belong to Blockbuster. I'm guessing some purchased it at one of their store's liquidation sales. It's fine, but I wasn't really expecting it."
3,video resolution only average,The movie was surprisingly cute and funny - Anna faris is always great - but video quality of resolution was only average
4,BUNNIES ARE MULTIPLYING!!!,"When i first saw the trailer for this film it reminded me of Legally Blonde, Sydney White, She's the Man, and others. This movie for me was intersting, for there are real people in society like in the house of Zata. They feel like there in low parts of society, but just to get out of their shell and feel confident for themselves was an amazing thing to observe. Yeah they look sexy, but it took more than just looks. Women shouldn't only be a sexy object for men, they need to help out their fellow sisters and show that all girls in society are equal and beautiful. I hope that this DVD will bring what the guys will want. Us guys should be able to own and love this movie, just like women do. I feel everytime this movie plays I just sit back, enjoy the comedy, and just feel like your sexy. You know what they say about bunnies that multiply."
5,Flippin Hilarious,Too funny...that's all I can say. I LOVED this movie and highly recommend it to any girls out there (or guys for that matter).
4,House Bunny anyone??,The House bunny is a very good movie. It's a funny movie but I thought it would be funnier. Anna Faris is hilarious as normal and it has a great cast. I wish their was a little more comedy in this movie so that is why I gave it 4 stars but overall I think it is a really good movie.Short Summary: Anna Faris gets kicked out of the bunny mansion so with no place to go she goes to a soriety house full of nerds to become their den mother. Can Anna Faris turns the soriety around to make the nerds become popular? Watch the movie to find out.This movie is full of mishaps and comedy. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy or to anyone who is a fan of Anna Faris.
4,Funny movie,"this movie is funny and has eye candy, I found it entertaining and has a Very pretty young lady playing the Houskeeper."
1,The House Bunny Has Cabin Fever,"There are times when a movie is so bad it's good, but this is not one of those movies. I gave this one star because I could not give it less than that. This is exactly the kind of movie the non-discerning masses have come to expect: a plot and dialogue written by a first grader, atrocious acting (so bad you can tell even Anna Faris wants out of this mess), and every bad message you can think of to impart upon our children. Even the one scene you'd expect to be fun, the makeover scene, winds up with egg on its face. The only funny moment was the thing Shelly does with her voice when she meets people, for which no explanation is given, and that got old fast. I've seen many bad movies in my life and, well, add this one to the list."
4,HB,"Came brand new in packaging, workd great. Great buy for the price. Very funny movie. Had to have it for my collection"
2,Doesn't live up to its own bad tastes,"look I like bad movies,i.e. The Marine. I picked up this movie with the hopes it would be a guilty plesure type of bad. I was disappointed. First this rips off SNYDEY WHITE and REVENGE OF THE NERDS in plot. It tries to have a lesson or moral to the story and it does. However,the script is not smooth. Things seem to move in a jerky manner. The movie never really decides on what it wants to be, either raunchy or sweet. The lead actress is quite good, but she is let down by the script. the other girls in Zeta house are not all developed and are short changed in screen time,i.e. the short girl. The villians aren't that bad and the big climax at the meeting is not exciting. The love relationship between the bunny and the man is not... well no chemistry at all. This movie sounds cute when you read the back cover of the DVD case but it never lives up to hope of a great ""bad movie."" I know this sounds rather disjoined but that is the way the movie is."
1,unpredictably predictable,"It was late at night, I was flipping thru channels to look for something worthy to watch. This movie just started so I gave it a try. I waited quite a while for the movie to try to be funny but even those moments were not funny. But I kept watching hoping it would surprise me with some twists. But the plot was flat predictable. I'm amazed how I watched till the end.Anna Faris had a superb body in this movie. She did a great job in playing her character. She gave it a 100% in being as goofy as she could be. I just wish the others like the director, the writer etc would have done well too in planning the story. It's way overdone in past movies already.This movie reminded me of ""Legally Blonde"" especially when Faris character confronted the panel in the hall. But no doubt ""Legally Blonde"" was a much better flim."
2,As Lightweight as a Playboy Pictorial,"While Anna Faris is a treat as always, ""The House Bunny"" is an unfunny, cliched picture that fails on almost every level. While it purports to be a ""Legally Blonde"" for the nerd set, it doesn't succeed as a comedy. Faris's enhanced lips are distracting, but not distracting enough to detract from the air-headed plot and script."
1,Where's The Music?,"This vhs and others in the Ed Sullivan series are filled with short excerps of the music and long, long general opinions by people who were not even close to the Ed Sullivan Show - some not even alive then or cared for the kind of music they are supposed to be speaking about. Some of the speakers use the music of The Ed Sullivan Show to promote their current commercial interests in music. Lost is the music brought to The Ed Sullivan Show, which was great."
3,Nice Device at a Worthwhile Price,"The arrangement is very good, with a pair of useful storage areas beside the three dispensers. Design is very appealing (for me the satin finish looks great) and complimentary to most bath decors. My only criticisms? The plastic. I managed to drop the unit while adhering it to the wall, and instantly broke one of the compartment hinges. Blast! Before I've even implemented it, I made it something to replace! My bad, but my experience says: be aware that it is a nice dispenser, but not a lifetime appliance. Second consideration was that one of three dispensers didn't have an adequate opening to dispense a moderately viscous conditioner. I'm still working to remedy that, and will update the review based on my experience."
2,Shower dispenser,"Fast shipping, but the product is not a good quality, It is to expensive for the quality"
3,something's missing,"Yes, Kirchin 's music is very good but we do miss all the rest that was used in the film, particularly the themes played by the mysterious ""Big Three"", the songs etc...So the intention behind was to do justice to the composer -Basil Kirchin- whose been a bit betrayed by the film's production as I understand, but then as a listener I miss the more ""popular"" music that was used and that is part of the general atmosphere in that beautiful film."
2,Poor Quality Recordings,"I wish I had known that this was an ""archival"" release, meaning most of the music comes directly off the soundtrack from the movie (even including some of the sound effects). The quality is not what I had expected. I really can't stand to listen to it. Still love the film, though."
3,Not the original,"Almost all songs in this CD are edited to shorten the play time. 'Rom', just as an example, does not have the beginning part of the first verse and chorus parts. Sound quality is very good, the mix is very skillfully done, and, yes, you will get 70+ minutes of continuous Dschinghis Khan in a 'club' fashion. However, if you want to get the 'original' songs as they were released, this is not a CD you are looking for."
5,The Great Nonstop,This is VERY talented Nonstop collection of the 80th German disco stars. The transition between tracks made smooth and precision. I have not seen better Assembly yet. Sound is original with one last song exception (remix). CD is printed in Japan. The quality of the record and the sound is simply exceptional. It has all the lyrics printed in German.
3,Test Off-Road 3,This is a good game if you have a non forcefeedback steering wheel or joystick It is impossible to play with a Sidewinder Force feedback wheel. If you have a regular joystick it is a good game. Because the wheel just goes all over the pace it is no fun at all! If you have force go with a differant game.
4,Good but Slow,Test drive Off Road 3 is a lot of fun to play on my computer but the games processing speed is awfully slow. It is slow even for a Intel Celeron 500mhz computer with 64 megabytes of RAM and Windows 98. It takes at least a Minute and a half or more while Need for speed high stakes takes at least 45 seconds to load a race. This game (Test drive off road 3) is a whole lot of fun to play but you have to have a little paitence when the game loads a race because it takes a while. but The music is cool and the graphics Are excellent. It is worth the wait for a track to load on this game because once you get going with the game It is a lot of fun.
1,"so promising, but...","So I have super sensitive ears and these earrings were great for that. And I really wanted to give them more stars, but I just can't because they are so difficult to close properly that I haven't been able to wear them! The thing about titanium is that it's super hard and after you open them enough to get them into the hole, it's impossible to close them properly again. I actually tore the hole in one ear trying to close them. So sadly, though they look fabulous, I won't be wearing them anytime soon."
4,"no rash, but no flash","I haven't taken mine out since I bought them, but mostly because they were so hard to close that I can't bear to do that again. On the plus side, which is a big plus, no rash and they don't poke with headphones or sleeping. On the other hand, they're so discrete you can't hardly see them."
4,Plain and comfortable sleeper earrings,"I have very sensitive earlobes. I have a difficult time finding earrings that I can wear without developing a reaction. I'm allergic to most metals in jewelry; even gold jewelry and earrings labeled ""hypoallergenic"" cause a reaction.I bought these sleeper earrings to keep my ear piercings open. They fulfill their purpose nicely and have not yet caused a reaction (I doubt they will...titanium is known to be one of the most hypoallergenic metals for jewelry).If you are thinking of wearing these for aesthetic purposes, I would look for something more elaborate. These are very plain, hardly noticeable, and resemble round wires in your ears. I would not wear these earrings to look pretty. They are purely functional.Overall, they are just as described and the photo is pretty accurate (but do check a ruler to see what 14 mm looks like...it's really quite small); don't expect them to look beautiful but do buy them for comfort and keeping your piercings open."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased these earrings for my teen daughter. I read all the reviews and even though some rated them unfavorably, thought they still sounded like a good purchase. The bad reviews were correct - the earrings are difficult to close and are not worth the cost. Save your money and look elsewhere."
3,Susan sleepers,"They are tiny, tiny. Would not have ordered them for this price + shipping if I had paid attention to size. It was not in inches.... they are 10mm, SMALL, very small. I did not think they'd be this tiny."
2,stay away from the 10 mm ...... they are extremely small,"I bought the 10 mm many years ago. I found them to be extremely difficult to handle because of the size and the titanium is kind of hard to manipulate. (yes, yes, I do know what titanium is) In any case I did manage to finally get them in myears and they worked just fine. They never have looked the same since then. They became bent and lost the round look and never did properly close again.I keep them around to use at night when I am having some irritation problems ( and practically everything gives my earlobes irritation).I was hoping by now they would have made some improvemnt with the ease of handling. I am not convinced that this has happened. I am still sitting on the fence about buying the 14mm and giving it another try. But please believe me when I tell you the 10 mm are very SMALL. I would not order them.fg"
2,Nice looking but hard to fasten DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your money. These are a nice idea but very very hard to fasten. Hoops do not stay round for long. If you are able to get them fasten, they will easily snap and become unfastened."
1,Not a reliable sourcebook for the Middle Ages,"Supposedly, this book was put together by some of the ""world's most distinguished medievalists""! One hopes not! In addition to the glaring errors of taste and judgment pointed out by some of the other reviewers, the factual errors are astonishing! One of the most egregious errors occurs on p. 138: ""Eleanor of Aquitaine, wife of two kings, Philip I of France and Henry I of England""!!!!! Eleanor, of course, was the wife of Louis VII of France and of Henry II of England! This kind of sloppiness is simply not acceptable in a book that purports to be by ""someof the world's best medieval historians"" (fronticepiece). The pictures are pretty; some of the articles are acceptable (but hardly noteworthy), but the book should be avoided at all costs by serious (or would-be) students of the Medieval Period."
3,"Lots of facts, some questionable, and too many polemics","It's hard to review an encyclopedia. But when this one arrived and I opened it at random, I landed on the article ""Jews in the Middle Ages.""Here is a long (7 column) article which doesn't even mention the Crusades or a host of other events and their impact on the Jews. Instead, it goes into polemics about various Jewish ideas and people, using highly charged words such as ""irrational"" and ""second-rate,"" and dismissing other major events as ""ridiculously exaggerated"" by using questionable arguments.An encyclopedia needs to be more even-handed or at least more temperate in its judgments; it is meant to be a resource and a starting point, not a platform for a particular scholarly view. (And scholarship should also watch its language.) While I found other articles to be more dispassionate and informative, I still feel that I need to keep more of a sceptical eye on each piece (none of which are signed) than I would like for such a book."
4,Re: John XXIII (not a review),"In Eric Roth's review of this book, he wonders if listing John XXIII as a pope in the 15th century is a typo. It's not. There was a schismatic pope of that time named John XXIII. (At one point there were three popes!) Since he wasn't universally recognized, he didn't count when John XXIII in the 1960s took the same name."
4,Good Subject Reference,"If you want a quick summary of selected subjects this is a good book.On the bright side at least this time Mr Cantor (or one of the contributing experts ensured historical veracity) noted that Marco Polo came from Venice. In his previous first edition hardcover book, The Civilization of the Middle Ages, it was printed that Polo was Florentine. Still if that type of serious error happened once, it does make one unsure of all the information in this book."
3,Watch Out For Little Ones...,I purchased this for my son for his 1st birthday. He is tall for his age so even though it says 18 months+ I thought it would be okay but the platform inside can be dangerous. We have had to place this up against a wall and place a bean bag chair inside of it and plastic ball pit balls so when he falls off he doesn't get hurt. He does like the slide but we really have to watch.I would buy this for 2 years+
4,good climbing toy,Bought this for my grandaughter age 18 months. Need to supervise so she won't fall backwards. She likes it and it is very durable. I think she will definely use it more as she grows.Again great service from Amazon.com!My grandaughter is now 20 mounths and this climber is my best investment. She loves it!!! Now she is more stable and not as much of a toddler. She is on it all day long. It is such good exercise for her. We add a blanket and she thinks it's a tent. I would be lost without it. A 10 star product now!
4,"Great, versatile toy","My son is 13 months. It's hard for him to climb up to the slide, as the only way to get there is sideways. However, I think this is a toy that has many fun options for different ages. Right now he loves to open the door and go in his ""house."" He thinks it's hilarious when the cat runs in through the holes. There's a great little room under the platform behind the slide - I put some books and a pillow in there, and I think he'll enjoy quiet time there if he's ever able to sit still long enough...He loves the slide, but I have to put him on, over and over. The two sides both offer climbing practice, and I think he will love both once he discovers them. The toy is a nice size - we have ours indoors for now and will move it outside next summer - although my 13-month-old is almost too big for the doorway and the holes that you can crawl through. Great toy overall though; we're very happy."
2,Not what I expected...,"I had read all of the great reviews and I guess I just got my hopes up. My son got this for his first birthday and now at 16 months old he still doesn't use it. We use it outside and we have the lookout treehouse inside. He uses the lookout treehouse much more. The slide on the Kangaroo climber if VERY short. Maybe he will get more use out of it someday, I guess I just wanted him to like it more. Easy to assemble and lightweight to move around."
4,Climber,"My grandson loves the slide and sitting inside the climber. We had to remove an inner piece because he kept hitting his head on it, but the slide still stays in place well for him to roll his cars down or slide. I do with the door was on the side instead of the back so that I could place it against the wall since I keep it in him room."
3,Disappointed,"We bought this for our 15 month old twins. The picture is a little misleading. There is no way 3 kids could play on this at the same time. The shelf inside for the slide takes up more than half of the space. My two spent more time fighting than playing. In the end we decided to return it and find something bigger. We did find it very easy to put together (and take apart), plus it seemed very durable. I would recommend it for a single child."
5,Fast Shipping,"The product is great, but the shipping time was the best. It came on the first day in the time frame that was given for receipt. Thank you!"
5,My triplets love it!,"This is so great! The door is a big hit since it feels like they're going in and out of a house. It just works so great. Mine is actually a different color, bright colors, but color doesn't matter to kids, lol!"
2,One year old daughter!!,We baught this climber for my daughters first bithday. We got it all put together and she couldn't even sit or crawl under the platform. She's not even a big one year old. She got bored with it very fast so we too kit back. The slide is pretty short too!
3,a little bit dangerous..,i think that platform is too narrow..it's kind of dangerous to let her play without supervision..so.. i returned it.
2,looks fun but children do not like this toy at all,i bought this for my son. he fell off the plate form 3 times and has never really taken an intrust in the gym. he like standing in the house part but other then that the gym is useless. i would not buy this gym over again. mine is brand new and does not have a mark on it.
2,Not the best,"I received this as a gift when my son was 1. I was concerned when I put it together because the platform does not go all the way back and it isn't very big - I was afraid he would fall off backwards when standing on the platform. I had to stand over holding on to him to keep that from happening. He had a hard time climbing onto the platform, also. Now he is 2 he doesn't have any trouble but is getting a little bored with it now. He mainly pushes his cars up the slide. I would recommend a bigger play gym because this one isn't that great."
4,Fun but toddler must be adult supervised!,"My son received this toy for his first birthday. We have had it inside on the carpet with an additional pad under it. He loves crawling through the holes, opening and closing the gate and crawling up the slide to turn around and slide down. He stands on the platform and plays in it as a fort. He is not afraid of it all. However, he should be! I know that he is still to young to be playing unsupervised on this toy so his father or I am always with him when he is on it. Still he has fallen off the platform at least 5 times. The last time he busted his lip and his Dad put the toy away for now. We feel that we definitely need to wait until he is more steady (18 mos.) before a serious injury happens. Beware of the platform - no parent is fast enough to catch their toddler falling off. But I still give it 4 stars for FUN!"
5,The best toy for little starters,"This slide is the best! We started with it in the house, it took minutes to put together. It is very durable and safe. The little door is neat because they can learn the open and close concept. And it has little holes underneath so he or she can climb through. I've looked at a lot of slides, and I liked this one the most for a first slide. Some slides are too high, or getting up to the platform is ""unsafe"". But I have no problem sitting back and watching my son play on it."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"We have had this climber since my son was about 9 months old. He is now almost five, and STILL loves to play on it. Probably not in the ways the manufacturer intended, but he shows me daily how durable this thing is. It is in tip top condition even after four years of hard play. We kept it around for our daughter (almost one), and I'm sure she'll get just as much joy out of it.I highly recommend this toy, however, you might check a local consignment store for purchase. The shipping must be outrageous, and unless it's been outside, the color does NOT fade. And surely a consignment price would be much better than the [$$$] they charge in the store. NOT THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT...OR MORE - it's just the bargain shopper in me rearing its ugly head.Anyway, enjoy it - I KNOW your kids will!"
2,much smaller than expected,"We bought this for our son's second birthday for him to play on outside. It was much smaller than we thought being that it was designed for kids up to 4 years. There were two 4 year olds at his party that were WAY too big for it. This would be a great inside toy, but I would opt for paying a little more and getting something bigger that would last as the child got older for outside play. My son does play on it but it just has a very restricted area of play and it needs a step to get up onto the platform."
1,Not worth the money,"My son is 15 months old, and he is already too big for this climber. He needs to duck his head to enter the door and is almost too long for the slide. He had fun putting it together with me, though, but then never played in it. Save your money!"
2,Complicated Assembly/Won't Stay Together,"I would NEVER buy this product again. It took FOREVER to put it together, even with the directions and working on a level surface, and it NEVER goes together right. It never STAYS together. Sure it's supposed to just snap together, but putting the slide platform in is like pulling teeth. The left step wall WILL NOT stay on, no matter how you adjust it or assemble it or pound on it with a rubber mallet. My son loves to play on it when I do manage to get it together, but when he and his friends get together, it FALLS APART.I would buy something ALREADY ASSEMBLED or something that actually has things that HOLDS IT TOGETHER!"
2,Watch those Boo-boos!,"I have to say that I thought this would be a wonderful toy for my 21 month old daughter. We bought it and I tried to put it together right away. It was not as easy as advertised. I had to practically slamm the pieces together with my feet. Well, Maddy woke up from her nap and we brought her outside to play on her new toy. She was delighted. She was able to pull herself up on the platform and sit on her bottom and go down the slide. We did this about two or three times and then the last time she fell backwards off the platform. And both me and her dad were standing right there. We think this toy should have a step up to the platform. She didn't want to go back on the toy for fear of falling again. She also is tall and had a hard time understanding she had to duck her head to sit down for the slide. I think this toy still needs design work. I doubt a 4 year old would fit on this toy either. At any rate, we took it back the next day and bought the Little Tykes slide. Much better."
1,Not sized right for age group,"My son (14 months) couldn't get in the door without bumping his head. The platform for the slide is too tall for him to climb on and yet too short for him to crawl under. The holes to climb through are just right for him now and will soon be too small. The overall size is great for indoor play but poor for my son to play in! Sadly, I returned it the next day."
3,Glad I didn't buy this,"I almost bought this climber, and I'm glad I didn't end up getting it. My daughter played with it at a friend's house - it is very small, and not easy to climb up on. Also it's really easy for a toddler to fall straight off the platform on the back - not well designed. The slide is tiny. My guess is a kid over 15-18 mos won't find this much fun. We got the Little Tikes Expedition Climber instead, and I'm glad we did."
1,DO NOT BUY ME,"This toy was horrible. We used it for about a month before taking it back and getting the climb and slide castle. The way that the floor is made, toddlers can fall off. My son fell three really good times and I got sick of sitting right next to him being all scared for him to fall. I would not recommend this to anyone. Stay very far away."
4,Big Fun for SMALL Climber!,"One thing everyone should know before purchasing is that this climber is very small. Smaller than ALL the others I have seen. My son is 19 mo. old and we just bought it, He seems to really love it!! I'm hoping it will entertain him for at least a year, although it is VERY durable and will last for many years to come. For the cheap price, you can't complain. Just be aware that it's NOT very big. My son has mastered climbing up the slide just so he can slide down, there is no ladder or steps to the sliding platform."
2,Was Only Used For 3 Months,"My 21-month-old son did not get much use of it. We wanted an outdoor structure where he could play on and we didn't have to constantly stand guard so he wouldn't fall. We thought this was the ideal toy for him because of it's size, but we were wrong. My son has fallen down a few times from the small platform and has hit his head numerous times on the top of the plastic walls. The doorway arch is too low, as well the archway for the slide. The platform itself is too low, so children cannot really crawl underneath to play in it. After a few months of this toy outside all by it's lonesome, we decided to sell and it get something bigger."
4,Kangaroo Jumper,The kids love to climb on this toy and my one year old loves to slide down the slide and then climb right back up it! It is a real challenge and she loves THAT!
5,wonderful indoor climber...lots of fun for my little ones!,"i bought this climber for my sons first birthday. He loves climbing up the slide. My 4 yr old son also gets some use of this climber, he pretends its a pirate ship. the slide is a little small for him but its perfect, with room to grow for my one yr old. i wouldnt want anything bigger in my living room. i have this in my living room of a two bedroom appt. it doesnt stand out too much because of the neutral colors. overrall im 110% satisfied with this climber. i researched alot of reviews online for indoor toddler climbers/slide and this looked like our best bet. only ""complaint"" is my gf has a daughter but doesnt want to purchase this for her room because the colors are ""boyish"", this wasnt a concern of mine as i have two boys."
1,Don't Go For the Hype,"If the alt.country genre is going this way - count me out. This CD is filled with cliched lyrics, over production, unexciting playing and overall comes across as bland schlock. Think late 70's Poco. I've seen Shurman written up as the next Son Volt - how anyone would make the comparison is beyond me. Amazon tells you to also consider Ryan Adams - it's fitting because he's putting out the same kind of garbage now.Go out and by a Richmond Fontaine or Drag the River disc."
3,if i ever catch up with 9th wonder....,"im gonna give him a new beat cd. honestly, his snares are beyond recycled. i dont care how many nice soul samples he comes up with, this dude is not nice with his drums, so chill with the pete rock comparisons already. buckshot is always nice with his, but whereas he is glorious behind beatminerz production, he struggles to keep this album up behind some played out production on the part of 9th."
2,No chemistry,"as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled ""chemistry""between buckshot and 9th Wonder. The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone. they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was."
4,9th Wonder Knows What's Up,FACT: 9th Wonder is the greatest producer ever in the history of hip-hop.
4,Great album by 9th Wonder and Buckshot,The beats are provided by 9th Wonder who is one of the best beat makers right now but is no where near Premo not even close but any way he produces a great album that also has above average rapping by Buckshot but nothing spectacular there are no dope dope tracks but there are many good ones and there is good replay value to it. This album is not for everyone however
5,Some Real Hip-Hop That's Been Missing,This is a refreshing album due to the abundance of bad ones in the marketplace today. Buckshot and 9th deliver a hard-hitting album that you have to love.
5,it's fantastic...,"had jaydee not passed, it would've been nice to see buckshot push it all the way to the both of them collaborating...his flow on a few of these beats are remniscent of slum v...i hope he brings it around and get madlib or doom to create with him - that would be so dope."
4,Off the Meter!,"Blazing...go check it!! Still not as hot as Sean Price's joint Monkey Bars, but the BDI is still bringing the heat like he did back in 1994! Production by 9th Wonder is still hot, and check for the joint that Buckshot did with Sean Price...more fire! Hotel Bravo."
4,More like 3.5,"This album is....okay. 9th Wonder (whos the best producer in the world) provides crazy beats (though far from his best). Its just that 9th and Buck dont mesh very well to me. Something in the equation is missing and I cant put my finger on it. The album sounds unfinished and rushed. Even the vocals from Keisha Shontelle dont mix with the 2 tracks she sings on. I dont know. Lyrically Buckshot is mediore. He doesnt seem any better or worst than he was years ago. Despite my negative review, this album is pretty good, if not only for the production."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","Having discussed ""Teijitsu Aikido"" in the past with Gary Bennet, it's ""founder"", the author of this monstrous book, it became immediately apparent that Gary Bennett knows little, if anything about Aikido. Don't buy this book.Having removed from his system all that makes Aikido a unique, flowing, graceful and effective martial art, Bennett succeeds only in reducing Aikido to ""McDojo"" trash.Don't buy this book.If you want to learn Aikido, this certainly isn't the book for you. To those already studying Aikido, a warning: looking at the garbage shown in this book and practising it could seriously damage your credibility as a martial artist.Don't buy this book.If I could give it zero stars, I would.Don't buy this book!"
1,As bad as a book can get,"If you even consider this book you are making a mistake. The techniques taught in this book are simply dumb and dangerous. You would be safer jumping in front of cars on the highway that to try most of this inefficient style of Aikido (made up by the author by the way).The author should be sued for misrepresenting Aikido. I gave it one star, because there was no ratings that gave zero stars...A very dumb and inefficient book... stay clear!"
1,Hideous book. Not recommended.,"One of the _worst_ books on aikido I have ever seen. Books like this make aikido seem like a joke.The author ""Grandmaster"" Gary Bennet supposedly holds a ""10th degree black belt,"" one that I can say was _not_ commisioned by the International Aikido Federation in Japan -- most likely given to himself (or by some random person off the street) to inflate his otherwise apparent inexperience in the martial arts.The techniques shown in the book are shoddy, sloppy, ineffectual, and plainly wrong. The author, supposedly a grandmaster, only shows us how to lift weights and punch and block, leaving the bulk of the ""aikido"" techniques to his white belts (beginners) to demonstrate. Strange.I wouldn't recommend this book to _anyone_ who is interested in aikido, even if I were paid $10 per book."
1,"Go to class, do NOT read this book","I concur w/ Alan Roberts of NZ. I looked over this volume in a bookstore. Although only 1st dan under Toyoda Sensei, I know enough to recognize poor quality, self-aggrandizement (10th dan, please) and a disservice to a wonderful, dynamic and compassionate art. If you want to learn aikido, go to a proper dojo, with a properly certified instructor and do it right, don't just read about it and feel you have learned the art. After all, mind AND body go together. If you simply must have a technical manual, ""Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere"" is a much, much better choice."
1,"Really, a very terrible book on aikido.","The stiff, ineffectual techniques shown in this book, only faintly resemble aikido and miss the entire art of real aikido: fluidity. I returned the book under the premise of ""false advertising"" and do not recommend it to anyone."
1,a waste of paper.....,"The sheer number of negative reviews should steer any unsuspecting buyers away from this book but....As a practitioner of Aikido, I am embarrassed that the term ""Aikido"" appears on the cover. This book is garbage, plain and simple. It isn't even good self defense.If you want a good intro to Aikido, I would recommend Shioda's Dynamic Aikido or Westbrook & Ratti's Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere.might not be such a waste of paper if it were in a format more easily hung in a bathroom to use as, well, you get the idea....If I could give a negative star rating I would."
1,A terrible book that completely misrepresents aikido.,"The founder of aikido said, ""The true secret of aikido is to cultivate a spirit of loving protection for all things."" This book shows none of this and is merely a manual for those who wish to learn how to break arms and apply painful locks. If it was a book on jiu-jitsu or some such art where these were the aims then it would be acceptable enough. It is, however, very unfortunate that the authors have sought to misrepresent this macho rubbish as aikido."
1,Is it possible?,"This is simply the worst book I have ever seen, about aikido. It really has nothing to do with the art. Especially aikido fitness? Tehniques are impossible. This book is wrong, especially for a beginner."
1,i'm the grand master of this style i just made up.,"wow! i quickly became suspicious, and then thought this looks terrible. ""no, no,"" i told myself, ""don't be too quick to judge."" then i turned to the -about the author- page where i learned that the author is a 10th degree black belt and grand master in the style he founded in 1989. he looks to be about 35 years old. if you know anything about martial arts nothing else needs to be said"
2,NOT WORTH BUYING.,"I FIRST HEARD FROM OTHER AIKIDOKA ABOUT THIS BOOK. THE AUTHOR IS SOMEONE WHO HAS NAMED HIS OWN STYLE AND SET HIMSELF UP AS A 10th DEGREE MASTER, IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT TEN YEARS. THE BOOK IS UNFOCUSED, ELEMENTARY AND DOES NOT HAVE MUCH TO OFFER ANYONE OVER A 3rd KYU. THERE ARE MANY BOOKS I WOULD RECOMMEND BEFORE THIS ONE."
1,Its NOT Aikido,"This book not only striped me of the 15.95 sticker price, it also got me jumped. After reading the so-called grand-master book, I practiced the techniques on my friend. They seemed to work(on him). Later that week at a concert, a few loud mouth drunks started harassing my wife. Having the confidence to physicaly stop them, I atempted a simple wrist-lock. I was stiffed by the larger assilant and thrown to the groud. Soon I was pounded upon by him and his buddies while my wife ran for security. Needless to say I spent the rest of the concert in the back of an ambulence. To top it off, the police could do nothing because there were witnesses saying I attacked first!"
4,Beyond words: Great Stories for Hand and Voice,I have used this book with great success both as a librarian and a storyteller. The simple gestures added to the story and repeated give the teller practical examples of adding sign to their storytelling. I love this book. For the price it can't be beat. I'm now on my third copy. Trudy Terry
4,Florida authors,"About as down-home as you can get. Charming stories and poems from Ms. Backen while giving us a glimpse of life along the Withlacoochee River in Inverness, Florida. Delightful stories for children, teens and adults that inspire, entertain and remind us of times gone by."
4,Nice cold weather sleeping bag,"I've bought two of this model. They work real well for cold weather camping. Most of my cold weather camping is with the boy scouts in igloos and snow caves. I've sleep on multiple occasions where it has been 10-20 degrees outside, probably 30 degrees where I'm sleeping and I've been cozy. The only compliant I have is the zipper catches on the inside baffle. My other summer Slumberjack sleeping bag has a larger zipper and doesn't catch. My summer bag is now 25 years old and still looks and works great. I'm hoping this model lasts just as long."
3,Naive?,"I think it is interesting that the author began her introduction with the idea that one of the reasons parents have such a tough time with their child coming out is because the concept of homosexuality is somewhat novel in this century. In fact the phenomenon of homosexuality is anything but new, au contraire, it has been around since time immemorial. It was widely practiced by the Greeks, and later easily spread among the Romans as well: think Nero and his cohorts, etc. I believe the exact opposite is true: it's not because homosexuality is novel that many parents have a problem coming ""to terms"" with homosexuality, it's more likely that most adults react negatively towards their child's coming out, because of what's happened to civilizations in history due in some measure to the pervasive and debilitating effects homosexual behavior has had on society. It's just as possible that some folks' reactions are due to knowledge rather than ignorance..."
5,lOVE Rita Rocks!,Its such a funny comdey if you love reba you will love this. Im very into this show and was dissapointed after season 2 it ended. it could if had a season 3 if lifetime would of made room for what a bunch of rerun movies that I have collected all on dvd . I HOPE SEASON 2 OF THIS REALLY FUNNY SHOW WILL BE RELEASED. THE DVDS WERE REALLY GOOD.
1,Battery problems,"The batteries in this camera, while easy to find AA, don't last more than a day at most. Everytime you go to take a picture, the batteries must be replaced. According to customer service, this is just ""the way the camera is"" and they suggest taking the batteries out for storage and replacing them before it is used. Not particularly practical for anyone, let alone the young kid that is supposed to be using it. Very frustrating."
5,Summary and Rating,"Section 1- SummaryIn my book ""Zooman Sam"" Sam as the main character is at Krupnik's nursery school. The kids were told to dress up as what they want to be for their job. All the other boys in his class want to be a fireman in his class. Sam doesn't want to be a fireman. Instead he wants to be somebody important.With the help of his mom and sister (Anastasia) Sam dresses up in a zookeeper's costume. Who would have thought? Maybe the title foreshadowed a lot! Sam's teacher let Sam to tell his class a little something different like an animal everyday. He likes the fun activity that he finds both really fun and challenging! The book was great!Section 2 - Rate the BookI rate this book Four Stars (excellent)I think this book was excellent because it shows what I can't remember what it was like in pre-school! But it was fiction since he isn't ""Vibrant"" like usual. I recommend this book to kids ages 7-12 that like some fun with a (almost real) pre-school's day."
5,U.S. role as capitalist overlord,"Opposed to U.S. wars? Wondering about the U.S.-French friction? Read this concise outline of how the U.S. emerged into, as Trotsky described it, the capitalist overlord of Europe and the rest of the world. Trotsky outlines the economic and military basis of U.S. dominance and the deceitful stratagems it was able to employ in the early years of its world role-and still does. Trotsky's historic perspective helps us to see that U.S. aggression today operates more and more from a position of weakness. Don't be awed by the monster, understand it, learn its vulnerable points. Read this clear analysis."
3,ITS FINE,"MORE FOR PPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 8 TO 13. I READ IT IN 1 HOUR AND A HALF. AND IM 14. PLUS I DONT READ THAT MUCH, YOU NOTICE WHY I CHOSE THAT BOOK."
4,"Great for fans, anyway","I'd start with Houdini, Melvins (""Lysol""), or even Eggnog before starting with this one, but there's plenty here to keep Melvins fans happy."
1,Skip It,"I could not take this book seriously knowing that it was meant to be a ""guide"" of sorts for new readers and most importantly meant to expose some of the works and lives of these ""cult"" authors. However, I found a mistake within the book which made me doubt how much I could trust the sources of the author, especially since it was providing readers with wrong information."
1,A Bootleg not worth buying,"""Look at Me"" featuring Jonathan Davis? Are you kidding? First of all the song is titled ""Lookaway"" and it's SEPULTURA and it's from their ""Roots"" album...The song called ""Switch"" that's supposedly Slipknot vs. Limp Bizkit vs. Pantera? Sure...I'm not sure who it is, but that's another one of those songs you get on Kazaa or any other download program when you search for Slipknot..."
1,....Bootleg?,Wow... How did this come about? I'm surprised to even see this on Amazon... like someone already mentioned... some of these songs aren't even slipknot... Sepultura isn't slipknot... and the lable never announced a new cd... so how do you figure this is new? Some of these remixes are on their digipacks... so it should be clear this isnt even an official release considering some songs aren't even slipknot... if you want this? Don't waste your money... I mean the songs are good but not even accurate.
3,Don't trust reviews about contents!,"I am very disappointed. According to many of the reviews, this came with a DVD as well as the Blu-ray. I needed a DVD for my kids, but could also use a Blu-ray in one room, so I went ahead and ordered it. Those reviewers were apparently lucky."
1,Overpriced,"This is a beloved classic, practically ruined by Hollywood in the live-action remake by Ron Howard. But a 26 minute Blu-Ray for $20+ bucks? The Grich may have stolen Christmas, but Warner is attempting to steal our hard earned cash. Wait for this one to go in the bargain bin by Christmas '09, then snatch it up for a better price."
1,Blu ray RIP OFF!!!,"A 26 minute video should be $10.00 (at the most) not $20 or so. Even if it is Blu ray it should still be $10.00. I think I as well as many will just enjoy are DVD version this year. Way to be a ""Grinch"" (whoever made up the stupid MSRP)..."
5,The original remastered Grinch DVD,"Marilyee in Wells, Maine.How The Grinch Stole Christmas...the original animation.How the Grinch Stole ChristmasThe remastered version of this delightful holiday film was better than ever! I like it better than the newer version. Loved hearing Borris Carloff's wonderful voice again. Max is just the best dog ever!!! LOL.This is a superb addition to any DVD library."
5,DVD just as good as on tv.,"This is one of my favorite Christmas specials. The quality of this DVD is very well done, it looks as well on the televison, as when it was first aired on television. This DVD has some special features on it, as well. Overall, a great purchase. If you are a fan of the Grinch, you'll be glad to purchase this DVD."
5,looks great,So I bought this because I wanted to see how it looked on blu ray had my doubts but was wrong looked great. Would definitely recommend to other blue ray collectors
5,Christmas magic,The same Grinch you know and love only this time in brilliant HD glory. It is a Christmas must have.
3,Collectors beware,"Be careful if it is ""fulfillment by Amazon' and sold by ""pieceofmindmedia"" It arrived with just a clear case and claimed that it was listed that way, it wasn't. I was able to ship it back to Amazon for free for a refund."
3,Same old movie...and costs too much,"Rally, the quality is not any better than a DVD, and may even be worse. The colors are not great. My biggest peeve is that you get only the 30 minutes of video for the price. For $19.99, I expected a bit more than a glorified (or not so glorified) DVD."
2,Plus a WINDOWS ONLY digital copy,"I've got the same problems as the other reviews, but would like to add that when they say PLUS a Digital Copy, it should be PLUS a WINDOWS ONLY digital copy as you can't get the digital copy if you don't have Windows."
3,Ok,"Everything was great, the picture, the movie, everything, but the storyline was just bad. At age 31 I never saw it, I could have passed…"
3,For the Kids,"I glad I purchased this dvd, but I remember the movie being alot longer years ago. much has been left out. I'm still glad I purchased it."
3,How many times do they have to release this,"I bought the DVD last year, and that was I think the second time this movie has been released, now this one will make the third... WHY??I wish that the movie companies would just release the movie or show once and make sure that they do it right the first time. If they want alternet endings, then put it in, if they want interviews, then get them done and put them in. Do not release it, then release with additional footage, then release with a new interview or making of... This is driving me crazy."
4,"Cute Anniversary Addition, Bad Packaging","This is an adorable DVD special addition with a cute shimmery cover. My only qualm was that the package arrived with a very large dent in the side (I used Amazon free super-saver shipping so I guess I shouldn't be surprised). Not really a problem for solid objects, but if there had been breakable items they would not have survived the poor handling."
5,my 4 r. old loves the grinch,i purchased a digital version for my ipod touch however my 4 yr. old son wanted it on the big tv without commercials...got this as a stocking stuffer...he was so happy...
5,The Grinch,"This is my favorite Christmas story. In my opinion, this version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the best for children."
5,Awesome Christmas Movie!,We love Dr. Seuss and this movie allows us to really enjoy his works during Christmas. It's funny and cleverly created and directed - perfect for a Christmas movie marathon!
5,"Short, but good for the grandchildren",I love Boris Karloff's voice in this movie. He is great. Wish the movie was longer as in Jim Carey's portrayal of the Grinch.
4,Great xmas gift,Bought this as a christmas present for a family member and they were ecstatic. Packaging looks good and it brought back good memories for the recipent.
4,"I Love the Christmas Classic, but...","Is it just me, is there something wrong with the math. If the movie was released in 1966 and this year is 2006, would it not be the 40th Birthday Deluxe Edition? Short of that, great movie"
1,Barely worth the money,"I was disappointed with this DVD. The intro forces you to watch a bunch of previews. Before that it starts with an anti-piracy warning including the Wizard of Oz and the Wicked Witch that my 5 year old was scared of. Did it really need to start with this? And then it was [...] for just the 20 minute episode. I guess I should have realized that is all I would get, but the reality of that after being forced through the commercials was disappointing. It should be [...] and Video on Demand."
5,Adorable,"Bought this for my Grandson and he absolutley loves it. We still watch it now and laugh. Love him so much and what makes him smile, makes me smile."
5,Christmas tradition!!,One of the best Christmas movies ever made!Great for children and adults alike!Watch it every year at Christmas with yourchildren or grandchildren and make ita family tradition as we do at our house.1
5,looks great!,The recoloring is nice. The grinch is really grean. The pink and reds looks so nice now like a new movie.
3,One of the Christmas Classics of TV,"This is likely the most known part of television for both Dr. Seuss and animator Chuck Jones. I can see why with the first, but the latter achieved even more, I feel, with both of Rudyard Kipling's stories ""Rikki Tikki Tavi"" and ""Mowgli's Brothers"", back in the mid 70s. However, this special definitely has its moments of brilliance. For one, Boris Karloff is the narrator (and is GREAT) and, also, Thurl Ravenscroft (voice of Tony the Tiger of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes cereal) is irreplaceable in performing the theme song. This is by far not the best of the classic Christmas programs, but is definitely in the top ten. On the other hand, it is the preferred filmed version - and then some - of the story. DO NOT waste your time with the worthless Ron Howard film adaptation, starring Jim Carrey, which makes, literally, the top 10 worst Christmas film list (if you don't believe me, Google this and see how many agree)."
4,Classic,"If it weren't for all the advertisements prior to the beginning of the show, I would give it 5 stars. The story is a classic that I grew up with and have now passed on to my young children. They love it so much that they choose to watch this every chance they get!"
1,Incomplete,"They cut out portions of the songs! I bought the DVD when my VHS tape wore out, and I'm very disappointed. The tampering was done with surgical precision, so anyone unfamiliar with the original wouldn't know the difference. But I grew up with this on TV and then on video, so 40-something years of acquaintance make me acutely aware of this change, and I hate it! I'm fixing my VCR so I can watch the VHS version I just bought to replace the DVD. I sure hope it's intact!!This review is for the Deluxe Edition of this DVD, UPC #883929042258. It has an outer cover sheath that is glittery. Whoopee. Making it sparkly doesn't make up for shaving the songs I have loved for so long! Shame on you, Warner Brothers!"
4,Hell Gate Review,"I found this book to be very interesting to read and it definitely got me excited about the new season starting soon. A huge fan of the show, I feel like I really know these characters. The only thing I didn't like about the book was all the jargon about weapons and ammunition, but it was still easy to follow along (even if I didn't know what the gun looked like or how powerful it was.) The plot was interesting and just like the series, each chapter kept me in suspense and wanting to go on reading to find out what happened next and how Jack ws going to get out of this one! Great book!"
2,lame,if you're a fan of the 24 series - this is NOT for you. it's too slow when you're used to the action of the series. and the narrative isn't written in the style of voice you are used to coming from jack bauer.
3,Not as exciting as the show,"I am a big fan of the TV show so thought I'd give the first book a shot and was somewhat disappointed for various reasons:1. The personalities of the characters do not come out in the book. Jack comes across as a ""nice guy"" always saying ""please"" and ""thank you"". Not the gritty, take-charge Jack of the show. Most of the other CTU characters only have one liners and their characters are not developed at all in the story.2. The plane flight from Atlanta to LaGuardia is a key part of the entire story and lasts for several hours in the book compared to only 2 hours in real life.3. Some chapters were action packed, but others were dull and boring to get through.I don't think this book comes anywhere close to the thrill of the TV show."
4,Entertaining,This book was very entertaining. Great beach book. Not quite as intense as the TV show....but intense enough to me intrested and I bore quickly.
3,"Classic 24, but with Flaws","Overall the book concept is good, and it tries to be faithful to the format of the TV show in that each chapter is an hour long, events occur in real time, and there is a hook to the ending of each chapter. Even the plot is good; using a surface to air missle to destroy a CDC plane and thus dump the virus over New York City.What bothered me is that many of the events of the books would seem to take a lot less time than portrayed in the book. Thus some events and situation seem long, compared to the time frame.Still, it's a good read of another adventure of Jack Bauer."
3,Entertaining enough,"When I first heard that there was a series of ""24"" novels, my only expectation of them was that they come up with a pulpy Mack Bolan-like style of entertainment. This first book in the series, ""Operation Hell Gate"" certainly does fulfill my expectation. If I have one complaint it's that the timing laid out for the events that take place is pretty ridiculous. If anything, requiring each chapter be representative of one hour (while it makes sense, given the nature of the show) really handicaps the authour and forces him into drawing events out much longer then they could ever conceivably take. A minor quibble to be sure, but it's a quibble nonetheless. I'd recommend this to any fan of ""24"". The characterization is good, and it's nice seeing alot of the Season 1 cast in action (and alive!). Also, it's always good getting some Tony. He's as integral to ""24"" as Jack is."
5,Should not have been cancelled so soon,"I think Sherri is adorable and I loved her in this show. The struggle of a single working Mom, dealing with an ex-husband, his new baby with someone else, a crazy job, trying to be an actress and a new love interest all felt realistic to me and hit just as many great funny moments as it did the poignant ones. I think the supporting cast was first rate, and Elizabeth Regen reminded me of many of my NY BFF's. Maybe she didn't strike the right note with others but I think everyone was well cast and did an excellent job of supporting and enhancing the story. Catch episodes on Netflix and judge for yourself but this is a 5 star show for me!"
5,Love it.....,"I watched faithfully every week when the Sherri series was on LifeTime and I simply loved it. The Characters aren't just funny, we can relate to each one of them. It's rare that we get to see good, clean, funny television. I really regret that the show did not last beyond one season."
4,Good Young Performer,Jake Owen could very well be one of the best new young country singers I've heard in a while. This DVD is loaded with new upbeat music.
4,Starting With Me,This CD was great. A few very small skips. Barely any scratches. I worked just as I would want it to.
3,a workable synthesis....,"....and an interesting summing up of many schools of thought. However, a key problem with the book and with most transpersonal models is what I think of as their verticality worship: higher, better, brighter. But so much of life--and in this I include spiritual life--occurs in the valleys, in the shadows and the messiness and the confusion of life, not in the middle of straight paths that hike up metaphysical mountainsides. I regard the notion that one can achieve blessedness through reading and hard inner work inflated, and I think the Zen masters so often quoted by integral folks would too. --Anyway, Wilber is quite readable and interesting."
5,Sleek and Stylish,This watch fits great and is very comfortable. Perfect evening watch that is easy to garner attention.
3,"It's a decent book allright, but the title is misleading.","_Gaffers, Grips and Best Boys_ is a great title. Unfortunately the title is misleading. The fine print is ""From Producer/Director to Gaffer and Computer Special-effects creato, a behind the scenes look at who does what in the making of a motion picture.""If you're looking for good, solid information about ""gaffing, gripping and best boying"" forget it. It's just one of the subjects touched on in this book.It's a decent book allright, but the title is misleading. If I had seen it in a book store I would have passed it by."
4,Really helps explain what everyone does to make a movie,"I really enjoyed this book. I never knew what gaffers and grips and producers actually did, but this book explains all those jobs. The book is written in the order that each person comes into a film, so you first learn about how an idea is generated, what happens with it, who gets involved next, and so on.One thing I really liked was all the personal anecdotal information that each interviewee gave. For example, John Lithgow talks about working on the World According to Garp, and Charles Joffee talks about what it was like producing specific movies for Woody Allen.A great book for someone who wants an enjoyable way to understand the intricacies of the filmmaking process."
2,Disappointing,"This book tries to be comprehensive but fails. It is incredibly uneven in its coverage of the people involved in moviemaking, devoting entire chapters to promotion and publicity, even a chapter on ""motion picture raters"" (?!) but the people involved with music--composers, arrangers, conductors, songwriters, musicians and music editors--get THREE PARAGRAPHS TOTAL.Skip it."
4,"Good, but...","A very good overall description of all the jobs associated witrh filmmaking. I thought that there would be a little more depth to the descriptions, but..."
5,I love this book!,"Many years ago I did a report on Samuel Adams for school. This book by Jean Fritz helped me get a high grade. It did not give me the impression that people who are smarter should be excused from being a soldier or any other ideas. In fact I enjoyed it so much that to this day I love learning about the American Revolution, because Jean Fritz made learning fun for me. I suggest that everyone read it."
2,Disappointing in its tacit approval of hatred,"While the book may be historically accurate, I am disturbed by the tacit message that hatred of a people is acceptable, even admirable. I suspect that Samuel Adams hated what the Redcoats represented, not the individuals wearing the Redcoats. In a similar vein, I question whether Samuel Adams believed, as the story indicates, that the ""brains"" of the revolution were too valuable to serve as ""soldiers"" of the revolution. Perhaps he did, but do we want to teach our children that the less gifted are suitable only for physical labor. I think not. Sometimes the most elegant solutions to problems come from those who can see clearly -- and they are not always the intellectually gifted."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this yesterday, vacuumed two carpets, emptied the dust holder twice and it stopped working. The ""carpet"" mode does not turn on. I have let the motor ""rest"" overnight, checked the connections, wands, etc. It's a piece of junk. I am returning on its first day after arrival. The 1-star reviews on Amazon are RIGHT. Please read them and do not buy."
5,Great!,"It works great! Very light weight which is what I was looking for, I like the ease of changing from carpet to bare floor with a push of a button. It is very manageable around furniture and under furniture. Highly recommended, with three cats and one big yellow dog it picks up lots of hair, I have to empty it often but expected that with all the hair. Also the shipping was fast, and well packaged!"
5,I love this vacuum!!,"I love the fact that this model is able to attack pet hair from carpet so effectively. Even though this was a refurbished product, you would never know it!"
2,"Everything you need , NOT","When i first tested out this vacuum, i have been satisfied with pretty much everything, about it, the button, the features, ease to use, and empty container.since i have been very exited about it, i left it plugged in the electrical outlet, after 30 minutes, i tried to turn in on, and it wouldn't, then i tried to clean the filter, and oblivously the power was down, i quickly referred to user manual, about some kind of circuit breaker, they said there was one on the brush, but it didn't do a thing,with the small letters in the manual it was written ""not leave vacuum plugged in when not in use""i mean how stupid, they thought of everything, but the the thing that would commonly happen, maybe i got a defective unit i don't know, this vacuum goes back, i have being using electrolux products for over 15 years, and they have been great, but this.I don't think these days saying ""what you pay, is what you get"" actually works anymore.Yev"
5,Fantastic!,"I had read the other reviews for the refurbished Electrolux and knew I was going to get it, I just hoped that the manuals would come too, and they did! SO! What we did was vacuum with our neighbors hyper-expensive Dyson and then unpack this puppy and vacuum right behind the Dyson. It picked up cat hair and who knows what else that the other machine missed, and then we happily switched over to the provided upholstery tool to do our couch and office chair, and voila! More uglies captured. Somehow it was very satisfying to see the accumulation in the see-through tank. And it's so quiet it didn't scare the cats! Highly, highly recommended!"
5,"The best buy, trust me",I am a serisous critic of products and I will tell you this is the coolest and easiast vacuum cleaner to use and operate. It is by far the best vacuum on the market today! I have several cats and it picks up all the hair and never loses it's suction. I do not recommend any other vacuum than the Electrolux EL 7055A.Thank you for selling a great product for a great price Amazon.Henry
4,Some elements of this product could be better,Plastic elements of wand started to break down. And it is only after 2-nd time of vacuum cleaner use. For the highly priced product i expected much more.
1,Useless piece of ^^&&((#$%@!,"I have had this vacuum since 2007. I thought I was getting a very good one.....not so. After the first year, the power began shutting off while in use....then the power head stopped working altogether. It was just a few days before warranty was up, so I took it back and got another one to replace it.....This one worked a bit better....but, even though I was cleaning the filter all the time, it kept getting clogged. I put it away and used the old dirt devil that I use upstairs, thinking I'd get another filter for it. I called about getting a new twin filter unit -- and, low and behold, that unit costs $147.00 -- for a piece of plastic. I have tried cleaning it, per instructions, but dealer says I need the filter replacement to make it work properly. All the dirt clogs around the little cone piece in the bagless canister part. I refuse to pay $147.00 for a PART! I wish I had never seen this thing. What a waste of money! Don't know what I'll get now..."
2,4th vacuum...still no luck,I have 75% tile and 25% carpeted floors. I thought that this would be the vacuum for me....wrong! It chucks dirt back at me on the tile. It leaves dirt...sand size all over the floor. This is depressing. It's okay for the carpet but for the tile it sucks!(not really)
2,Not the greatest,"Received this pen today. It is not a ballpoint pen; it is a gel ink pen. The pen only wrote for a little bit and then was done. It needs a new refill, which is no big deal I guess since I would've swapped out the gel for a ballpoint refill anyway...but it still would've been nice to get some use out of the refill that came with the pen. The cushy grip had a weird sticky film all over it that did come off - thankfully! Since the ink didn't work for very long I haven't had much of a chance to use the pen for any length of time, but it was enough to feel that the pen is a little heavy on the clip end. Not very well balanced in the hand. I'd just return the pen if I felt like making a trip to the Post Office and spending more money on postage. I have some extra Parker refills that will work in this pen, so I might as well keep it. I was hoping to love it right out of the box, but maybe it'll grow on me in time."
5,Sweeter rain,"this cd reminds me of when I first heard them in the 90""s I really love all the songs, it was right before I accepted Jesus as my Savior"
4,Amazing Peace,"Manish combines excellent Indian classical sounds with neoclassical fusion of electronica. Also a good sampler of how Indian music is taking a global form. Tumi Bhaja re Mana evokes the soul to pray, Ishq is ode to eternal love, Shivoham is soul journey to Nirvana... U"
4,It applies to the world I live,"After reading all the reviews I noticed a trend in the comments. Those who bashed the magazine were selfish; wanting to live life their way and with no true purpose, and most importantly ignorant of what it means to lead a Christian life in today's world. Yes, you say Christian teen girls have no life, no freedom, no enjoyment in life. Well, how would you know unless you've lived it? I love my life and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. From experience I know that God's love is more real to me when I apply his promises in the Bible to situations I face today. This magazine is an excellent way for teens, like me, to bring God's word to their every day lives."
1,disgusting,"This is ridiculous. Instead of challenging our young people to reject the mysogeny of the fashion industry, instead we are catering too it. This ""Bible"" is a grade A example of everything that is wrong with american pop christianity today.Young women need to know that they are worth more than just what they look like. This ""bible"" is a very mis-guided attempt at ""selling"" the gospel but is actually a way for the publisher to sell more books and make more money."
1,Decide for yourself... check it out.,".... I agree that the pictures they use don't exactly match the image they encourage, and that it may send conflicting messages about body image and ""fitting in"".Something I liked about this study Bible (really, that's what it is) is that it offers answers to questions teenage girls have. I may not agree with the conservative view they offer, but I think this study Bible is a valuable resource and a good place to start discussions. It offers monthly calendars (not year-specific) which encourage readers to have an active faith life including worship, praying for persons of influence, visiting the sick and elderly, writing letters, and volunteering with poverty-relief agencies.I hope they come out with a similar resource for teen guys. I applaud this production."
4,Very well thought up!,"I first saw not Revolve, but Refuel, the New Testament for Guys when my good friend got it. I commented it, and he said, ""I think there is one for girls, too."" I went to my local bookstore and there it was. I bought it with my birthday money (I had turned 13 that day) and started reading it. I liked it from the start. It is very encouraging, and good."
5,Praise Jesus!,"I was really worried about giving the Bible to my children until now! With all that sexual perverseness, violence and vindictiveness the Holy Book is filled with I'd hate for my daughter to start questioning why God behaves more like genocidal tyrant than a loving father. Leave it up to those wonderful creatures in marketing and commercially-applied child psychology to formulate the perfect revision to the Bible!Instead of looking at those beautiful tramps that fill the entertainment industry with sexual promiscuity, she can have her anorexic eye candy (wonderfully selected from stock photography) sandwiched between the good scriptures! And it teaches her to be such a lovely, compliant lady! Let's hope our friends in marketing continue to synthesize these body images and submissive ideals and perhaps we'll have a glorious return to the 50's!"
1,DANGER!,"My fellow classmates and I recenlty obtained a copy of Revolve which quickly became the entertainment at a recent event. Though I cannot speak for my classmates I agree 100% with the review posted by Jan Chapman.This ""Bible,"" though it appears to be updating the New Testament and presenting it in an appealing fashion for young women, I belive, in actuallity that it will prove to do more harm than good. Through out there are quotes and quizes and top ten lists that if taken seriously will send young women back into a previous life. Young women can do anything they set their minds on and don't need the help of a man unlike the opinions of the aformentioned side bars.There are very few people of color and all of the young women are stick thin. What message is this sending especially to pre-teen girls?This ""Bible"" needs to be used with EXTREME caution, if used at all. This publication deserves much lower than an F but since the scale only goes that low I am forced to give it that."
5,A Must for all teen girls!!!,"Revolve is AWESOME!!! It's a New Testament that actually looks like a fashion magazine and it's wonderful!!! I got several copies and started giving them to the teens I know and they love it! This Bible lets teens know that the Bible can be hip and applicable to where they are in life! And the New Century Version is really easy to read, so people actually understand the Bible! I'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,Could things be more stupid?,"This just goes to show that in America, marketing is everything. And it's sad that people resort to making a buck with slick brainwashing techniques like these. It's the editorial equivalent of starting a cult. What could be more vile?"
1,crap,sorry I have not read this but I jsut want to say that this idea made me laugh. So funny how the old try to push their views on the young. screw this crap!
4,God speaks to all in many different ways,"The editors should be commended for being innovative in this new delivery of the New Testament. Any Bible (even the revered KJV) with study notes included, presents a particular publisher's point of view. Parents should read Revolve with their daughters to balance those views. I am a student of reformed feminist theology and will simply discuss with my daughters the points of the sidebars with which I have a difference of opinion. The young girls I shared this magazine with (ages 14-16)received it with great interest - and they sat down to READ IT! How often does that happen? I view Revolve as a launching point, not as the only Bible a young woman should ever read...."
1,A great start for getting into real satanism,"Well I'm not a Christian, but I have no problem with Christians as long as they aren't doing anything to harm anyone. This book, however, can apparently do nothing but serious mental harm, and the fact that it is being marketed to clueless girls is utterly repulsive. This is much more like the Devil's bible then anything else. Why would God create girls in the first place if he was just going to control them with this mindless filth? This book is the type of thing that simply lowers your intelligence just to look at. Girls should be thinking for themselves, not doing what God apparently tells them to do. I will tell you though, if God exists he surely wouldn't want his creations reading this garbage...in fact I wouldn't go around recommending this book to anyone, for that seems like a sure ticket to Hell."
4,Christianity Packaged for Today,"I bought this for my teenage daughter. Frankly, I find the typical girl/teen magazine format a bit silly, but then... I'm not part of the targeted readership! If the New Testament has to look a little like Girls' Life to get a kid to read it, then I say go for it. The book is like a thick magazine and yes, it actually does have the NT inside (in between the ""what boys really think"" blurbs).I couldn't help noticing that the one-star rating by 'Silvertree' stuck out like a sore thumb. Finding that her previous review experience on Amazon has been limited to feminine hygiene products and her 'wish list' full of books on wicca and paganism, I had to wonder whether she didn't have an agenda of her own. ""Revolve"" hardly sounds like the kind of book she'd pick up. Smacked of Christian-bashing to me and was the final consideration in convincing me to buy it."
1,Please take religion seriously,"This book simply cheapens religion and brings it to the level of another ""how to"" book aimed at insecure young women. Is it necessary to assume that all young women are too illiterate to really read the beautiful language of the King James version?"
1,I would give this zero stars if I could... or negative 5...,"Just so you know, here is an excerpt from Revolve New Testament... I got it from salon.com:""Thinking of asking a guy out? Revolve girls don't. ""Sorry,"" they're told. ""God made guys to be the leaders. That means that they lead in relationships. They tell you they like you.""...I am thoroughly discusted."
1,"It's a sad, materialistic world","What has the world come to when we have to package the Scripture in a Seventeen magazine?? Yeah, study Bibles are cool... when they help you understand the scriptures. Nowhere in scripture does it compare makeup foundation to Christ as the foundation of your life. That is, unless you are reading Revolve. It's sad this sort of stuff is even sold in Christian bookstores, let alone endorsed by the Christian media.Things like this destroy young girls. It's more destructive, I would venture, than even YM or Teen People. Because no longer is the message, ""you need to look like this to be popular."" The new message is this: ""you need to look like this in order for God to love you."""
5,Excellent solace for the grieving..,"This is the 20th copy of Safe Passage which I have purchased so I felt it appropriate to add a review! When I lost my mom suddenly in 1992, with no time to say goodbye, a grief counselor gave me a copy of Safe Passage with page 205 marked specially for me...""Rest assured that in her dying, in her flight through darkness toward a new light, she held you in her arms and carried your closeness with her..."". It meant the world to me and gave me peace. Every recipient of this small marvel of a book has found solace and comfort and I highly recommend it to any one who does not know what to give, what to say, how to help...this helps!"
5,Comforting,"I found this book at the library after my mother died, and found it so comforting that I bought one for myself and one for each of my siblings."
2,Disappointed,"I have not yet read this book and there may be some good words within, but my problem is there are truly only a few words!!!! By that I mean this is the first book I have ever bought that has only half pages of words. The whole book does not have one full page except the first 8 pages which are her introduction and then 274 pages are half, some only have 3 or 4 lines on them - what a waste!!! I read another book, different author but some of Molly's quotes were in this book and they were what inspired me to order her book, but I was very disappointed."
5,Amazing Help with Grief,One of the best books for anyone going through the grief process. It's one of those books that truly speaks to you and even years later makes total sense. Very thoughtfully put together and a book you will want to pass on or buy for others who have experienced loss.
4,Great video made by dog lovers themselves,The producers of this video never left Monty at the Shelter.I know for a fact he is happy and living with the producersand their children. He is a HUGE part of their family. Has beenfor a very long time. He was a rescue dog. They did foster a dogfor us at the Humane Society to help socialize him but he was a fosterand he has found his forever home and thanks to them is a verysweet and social animal.JKNHSociety
1,It's a CD not a pair of ballet flats,"Surprise.....A CD shows up not a pair of shoes.The title of the CD ""the day the colors died"" by Bloomsday, I think some how the description and title are confused.Too bad because I wanted shoes not a CD!My bad for not checking the whole description etc."
2,not to great,It was a great camera .. it took great quality photos. the the flash sometimes dosent work to well. After a few weeks it stoped working all together- it wouldnt turn on or anything. my advise - get a different camera even if costs a little more.
5,A must read,"The book gives a good overall description of several areas of system vunerability. I especially like the numerous web resources that are included throughout the book. This book takes a full disclosure approach to network security. If you like full disclosure in security related issues, this book is for you."
1,Disappointing !!!,"Sadly the content looked really good, as did the hype. But when you read the content it is really weak. Nothing new here at all ! It is written by a bunch of respected guys on the so called underground. I can only describe them as a bunch of bare knuckle street fighters; I wanted a book by prize fighters.n They dont get the fact that sure you can break things but the underlying technology or Math (in the case of crypto chapter) is often sound, it is usually just a matter of bad implementations.The book was also written by multiple authors and that shows. It is disjointed to say the least.Oh and the patronizing ""Tips for IT Pros"", ......."
2,Give me a break!,Hardly any detail in the examples and missing too many important and common techniques.
5,This type of book has been needed for a long time,"I've been waiting a long time for a book like this to come out. It covers full disclosure in a such a manner that has been needed for awhile. While the underground already knows the majority of the information covered, it should definitely open the eyes of the ""average"" system administrator, and this is the type of individuals that need to know this information in order to protect themselves. Great job Ryan, Stace, RFP, Greg and all the other hackers who participated in this project!"
4,Good Introduction,"As a technical writer wishing to learn more about network security, I found this book helpful. I feel it is also of use to sys admins wanting to know more about trying to ""hack-proof"" their networks. While other books may give more in-depth info, this one covers a lot of basic information. Areas such as the ""politics of hacking,"" the laws of security, different types of attacks, diffing, cryptography, buffer overflow, packet sniffing, spoofing, etc. are covered here.There's also chapters devoted to the infamous ""security holes"" on every computer and how to deal with attacks or viruses. As others have pointed out, this may not be THE DEFINITIVE book on network security, but it does offer a good general approach to it."
1,Wrong Item Pictured,"The product that was sent to me was the Playskool ""My First Elmo,"" which has the wide open mouth and textured soft fur. While the product is cute, it is NOT what was pictured above and NOT what I wanted. I am working on returning the item to the seller as I really wanted the My First Pal Elmo, which is pictured above with a closed mouth, and which you could find in stores a couple of years ago."
4,Gift,"I LOVE Elmo, having no kids of my own, I try to give everyone an Elmo at some point early in their development. This is a gift for my 7 month old niece...wanted one that made sound just to annoy the parents...but this will be more age appropriate."
4,Delaware on the horizon,Definitely a page turner. The book had a message: Young girls and women should learn to love theirself. The poetry was on point. Keep up the good work and keep the books coming. You're putting your thing down for Delaware.Congrats Shahida!
3,As pictured,The headphones were a bit heavier than I expected and won't stay in place. Also there were no bonus earphones or carrying case with them.
2,THE PRICE WAS A LITTLE HIGH,THIS WAS MY MESS UP I BOUGHT THIS THINKING THE PRICE WAS GOOD FOR THREE HEADS! BUT AS IT TURNED OUT I READ THE ADD WRONG IT WAS FOR ONLY ONE HEAD AND THAT MAKES THE PRICE NOT GOOD!!!! BUT IT WAS SHIPPED FAST:)
4,Enjoyable Read,"While not the best novel for characterization, Too Few For Drums is an enjoyable novel about the Peninsular Campaign. The descriptions of Spain are good. The technical aspects of the novel including units, uniforms, movements of the armies, etc., are accurate. True, the characters are stereotypical and somewhat shallow. If anything, I would say that the novel was too short and needed more work before its release."
3,Too Few for Drums,"After reading Delderfield's Seven Men of Gascony I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. I was however gravely disappointed. The Penninsula campaign of the Napoleonic Wars is the setting for Too Few for Drums. This novel follows the trials of a young British ensign and his file of infantrymen as they make their way from behind French lines. It lacks the breadth and scope of his other novel. Some of the plot mechanism lack credulity. The ensign is transformed from an inexperienced self doubting young officer to a confident, future leader of men by the mere act of losing his virginity. Were it only so easy!"
5,The Nelson Contemporary English Dictionary,"This wonderful dictionary was published many years ago. I had two copies of it. Unfortunately, over time, I lost them. My native language is not English. I am grateful to the publisher and author/compiler for this dictionary as it immensely helped me building my vocabulary. The presentation of entries was very facilitating and the pronunciation for each entry was given in a unique way that the book definitely did help the reader learn the proper pronunciation. In my strong opinion, this book should never become out of print. It will have its use generation after generation.Ashiqul Hai Saiyed"
3,Water resources assessment: methodology and technology sourcebook,A review and evaluation of methodologies and technologies that are used directly or that have potential application to environmental impact assessment and/ or impact assessment and alternative evaluation studies for water resources programs and projects.
3,Average,"This book is perhaps a good introductory text for those who do not have or do not wish to invest in gunsmithing equipment. Topics covered are largely mundane and include: scope mounting, bedding, boresighting, etc. Much of this information could be had from the instructions that come with the materials listed. There are a few genuine jewels of information that probably make it worth its' modest price. It is a superb book for the neophyte, or someone who simply wishes to be an informed consumer of Gunsmithing services."
4,A good approach,"Gunsmithing: Rifles is an easy read for someone with novice level of gun knowledge. If you know the barrel from the butt stock, but want to know more, then this is a good place to start.The font is easy to read with captions for pictures being bold, to allow the eye to easily focus on them. The pictures are good, but suffer a lack of clarity due to printing in grey scale.Overall I've found this to be an enjoyable read."
5,Great pictures and clear instructions!,This is a great read and offers incite into the art. I often look back in the book to find the tips and tricks of the trade and technics given by the author.
5,Golden Nuggets,"This book is so enjoyable to read that you may be surprised how much you are learning and gleaning from its insights. This book has great examples of how to apply lessons to your day-to-day life. I loved Rabbi's other book, but this is great in a totally different way. It is non-political but still has a lot to say on th best way for us to organize our relationships, relate to our Maker, and become successful in our professional lives. This book made me want to meet the author and ask his advice on everything- which most 'self help' books do not usually do. I heartily recommend it."
5,ENLIGHTENING -,"This book is a must for unobservant Jews who don't realize that Hebrew words have multiple meanings and conotations. The chapters for each designated ""word"" are short, eye-opening,easy reading and thought provoking. I am trilled with the new knowledge imparted.Steve P, Texas"
4,So far so good!!,"You're supposed to read a small ""chapter"" every day in this book - haven't done that to date but I'll take it in my own timing. Seems as though Dr. Colbert knows his stuff and is genuinely passionate that people live life to the fullest and make a big investment in their one and only human body & soul. I look forward to discovering a better and stronger version of me as I learn and apply more of what's inside."
5,Seven Pillars of Life,This book plus 2 added journals are very helpful. The information is clearly written and easy to follow. Each day of this journey brings an understanding of how God intended us to live. I can feel the energy growing and my health is revitalized. I will use these steps for the rest of my life.
5,Seven Pillars of Health,The Auther is a practicing physician here in Florida. For several days on different channels he was a guest being interview about this book.It has some very interesting information.
4,Very Educational,"I saw this book at a friends house and was noticing some changes she had been making in her daily life, in all sorts of ways. So I decided to try the book out for myself! I have learned SO much and feel a bit enlightened by the process! I am a vegetarian and eat very well, and there were still so many things that I learned about diet that have changed how I feel daily, my energy is higher and I feel more confident in the decisions I make not only affecting my body, but the earth. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn a bit more about saving yourself and the earth!"
5,The Seven Pillars of Health,This is a tremendous book. It is very informative and detailed and is certainly one of the best (and most comprehensive) books I have ever read on health. I highly recommend it to everyone.
5,Take control of your health,This is an excellent guide for a healthy lifestyle. It is easy to follow and will change your life in 50 days. The only way to achieve wellness is through prevention. Living according to the 7 pillars of health will achieve optimal wellness. The book is well written and authoritative.
3,Hopefully not a disappointment,"My wife and I are looking at this information Prayerfully. There are so many ""experts"" that claim to have ""the answer"" to all our problems and issues, it is hard to sort out the """"truth""""! So, we are carefully weighing what we read and hear. This experience will be a chance to see Dr. Colbert demonstrate his expertise in the area of health, and we shall keep an open mind till we finish reading the book and try out some of his suggestions."
3,Not much new information,"This book isn't too different than most of the other ""health books"" the information is good and reinforced concept that I had read before, but always good to hear again."
5,A breath of inspiration,Dr Colbert did a fantastic job simplifying health issues and showed biblical references. I particularly enjoyed the many charts he used (but many charts or tables were hard to read on kindle). This book was very motivational in helping me get on the right track In improving my overall well-being. this book was very inspiring!
5,THANK GOD!,"this book has help me and my family so much.my husband has many health problems, the to mainones are copd, and chf- congested heart failurewith this book we have a much better understandingof the importance of drinking WATER!thank GOD for this book.CATHY/CARTER TADLOCK"
5,A great book!,I am just three chapters in so far but it has been great. I am taking my time and not rushing through because it is so full of things that you need to know. I have already done what he suggested in the book about our water and it has helped tremendously in our house. I have read some of his other books on health and he is very balanced and such a good read.
3,My opinion of 7 pillars of health,Definately not worth the cost. It calls for items not available in my area.
1,You call this faith?,"Its a shame that Christians flock to the latest tome, and checkout ""bestsellers"" for direction in health or any other matter. We can truely TRUST GOD, we don't need the latest self help book to do that either. Stop buying these overly hyped books and start seeking Your Father. Oh I know all the rock star ""christians"" the stars of the religious movements of our day highly recommend these, but you can have shelves loaded with this stuff and it will do NOTHING for you. Try Jesus,He loves you. I myself have been healed many times of deadly disease, and I've been comforted always. He never NEVER fails.Don't worry about the planet, or your self or health, stop putting your hope in the political religious stuff and come out and believe in the ONE whos NAME you claim. Otherwise keep reading this stuff..it may not hurt you much, but it sure won't help you !"
3,haven't read this book yet!,"i only rated a 3 because it was the number in the middle. i haven't read the book yet. i'm still amazed at how many authors have this title. so in all fairness, i've only heard other people say it was a great book, but most of those comments came from people who are now focusing on better health. sorry, that's all i can say about a book i haven't read yet."
5,"FABulous book, easy read","This is a wealth of information in an easy to understand text. We are so fortunate to have Don Colbert to help us educate ourselves in the fight for our good health. I praise God for him, a man who gives God the Glory for his knowledge, we can't listen to him enough!"
3,"Great graphics, bad gameplay.","This game has great graphics but the game is very hard to beat. It is fun to just mess around on the missions but it is very hard to beat the whole game. It took me forever. So now i go to quick hunt and hunt for anything that i see. I love the bullet cam so u can see how close u were to hitting the game. The graphics r excellent for 2005. It does not get boring that fast but it is very hard, it has many features that u can buy from the store and u can make ur own hunter and choose the features on him or her too. This would be a great game if it was not so hard so i just use the quick hunt unstead of the carrer mode."
1,Great Game...HORRIBLE PROGRAMMING,"This game is so much fun!!! However, for any type of serious gamer this game is plagued with errors and mishaps.This game is a pain in the ass. To be completely real, in over 16 years of comprehendable games...this is the worst.It has excellent game play and all, but the ERROR messages which FORCE you to reset the game after a long hunt (1 hr or so) is not worth it. (I did what the company told me and I got an unknown error message).THIS GAME SUCKS....DO NOT BUY IT...UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FRUSTRATION"
3,o.k.,It is an ok game but you can only carry 1 firearm at a time plus 1 bow. I like how you can edit you person.
4,Try it before you down it,"I got this game when it came out in 2005 and I must say it was difficult starting off. Its even more difficult without the aids. But once you learn the ropes, everything is fine. It is more interactive with the other characters and a real ""longhunting"" adventure where you can camp out to recooperate from injury and fatique and trek though each section. I like it. Its not quite as dangerous as the other games, but plenty of animals will attack ya. So be on your guard and I cant stress enough about resighting in your rifle. It shows that wear and tear will throw the zero off eventually. Its also the first video game I was able to complete. But would I try it on Hard difficulty? Ill save that for another review. Enjoy."
3,Uneven,"These disconnected essays are all over the board, subject-wise and quality-wise. Some require familiarity with various apologetics interest groups to be understood. Some, by Keating's own admission, are hastily written and put forth arguments that are sketchy and incomplete. Some, such as the discussion of Ayn Rand, are well written and illuminating. Some, like the reflections on Greek Orthodox iconography and its history, are fascinating but not particularly connected to apologetics. Read this to get a smattering of interesting ideas and facts, not for a lesson in apologetics."
5,THE Magazine for the Commercial Graphic Artist!,"I have been buying copies of this magazine in New York City newsstands for years now. I think the first one I picked up was because it contained listings for graphics compatitions. But, I was an evolving graphic artist in Rochester, NY ... educated in Architecture, and teaching myself the rest of what would become my career - Graphic Design. Pen & Ink, masking, layouts, the evolution of a logo design ... all the techniques and steps laid out in feature articles which focused on the work of an individual or design studio at the top of their game. And in between were the articles on how to negotiate a contract, how to present your ideas to a client .. how to GET clients.It's full of images ... less talk. We are, afterall, visual artists and know we learn best through what we see.This is a worthwhile magazine to get. You'll find something useful every issue."
5,HOW Inspires.,"As a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school, I would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat. Not only does this magazine site books that may help designers, but it also gives advice on what works - the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing.I come from an entire family of designers, illustrators and art directors, all whom love Communication Arts - but that one is far too boring for me. HOW is more exciting, and for only $30, it is at a very reasonable price."
5,a designers MUST,great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures. Sadly it only comes 2x's a year.
5,Flex-a-lite 31165,"Much better than the original controller. They got rid of the female connectors for the high power cables. Now they are hard-wired. On my old controller, the female connector eventually worked them-selves loose, so, no-more-fans. Now, also, the fans start slow and speed up, where-as the old controller the fans just surged on ! Other than that, the unit is identical."
4,flex-a-lite 31165,"i've been using this product is very good. i've used it so far for three month and it can handle all but the most hardware fan setup. i like how i can easily add manual override-on so i can force it on, and even convert the probe style temp to NPT style ANYtime i want. the soft start feature is also excellent to reduce the effect of amperage spike for e-fans. all wiring for this kit comes with 10gauge (sometimes it almost feels like 8gauge) so i can handle the amperage.the minus: kit is alittle bulky so its not as easy to hide it. with the big fuse holder, it makes installation alittle less clean. also i did not like the temp adjustment dials, that had no temperature indicator so you have to guess what you set it for.overall i'd recommend this to anyone. i've called flex-a-lite support about three times to ask various technical questions. they are very courteous and know their product very well."
5,"""I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through...""","Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield is one fun and charming debut album from this beautiful singer/songwriter. These Words (I Love You, I Love You) was her breakthough hit, still sounds great three years later. Single and Unwritten are also outstanding tracks as well. Some of my favorite songs on this album include: Slient Movie, I Bruise Easily, The One That Got Away, Stumble, If You're Gonna, Wild Horses, and the hidden track, Sojourn. Bedingfield's voice is soulful, lively, and quite impressive. This gal can definitely sang!! There were some great albums released in 2005, and this one is no exception. I highly recommend this gem and her sophomore album, enjoy!"
3,nice start,"These Words and Unwritten are melodic songs with beautifully written lyrics that anybody can relate to. I thought the rest of the album would be just as impressive, but despite the instrumentation used her vocals don't really match the efforts from musicians"
1,What the hell is this???,"Dear God, what the hell has music become?!? I never thought I would long for the boy bands of the late 90s, but just when you thought pop music couldn't get any worse, the music industry loves to surprise us with another talentless hack.Seriously, anyone rating this above 1 star (in which I feel is quite generous for this pile of puke) should learn to listen to the words. If that is impossible (possibly because in this case, it's too painful), Google them up. This girl must have had more alcohol in her than Bon Scott and John Bonham combined to write something so rediculous and terrible.Seeing how this pile was released a month ago, and is already out of the Top 50 (assuming it even charted that high), gives me hope that people still have some slight tastes in music... for now... :("
1,NOT GOOD FOR 64bit USERS,"Since, I don't care about stealing any music, the ""Copy Protected"" warning didn't bother me in the least. I am a Hardcore gamer I have a high end 64bit PC running Windows XP Pro. The CD claims it is compatible with Windows XP, it does NOT specify which versions so I assumed I was OK.I installed this CD and I was forced to accept some agreement and then it installed some lousy music player. Everything seemed fine until next time I rebooted my PC both my DVD and CD drives had literally disappeared! That's right this so-called copy protection destroyed access to my drives!!! The copy protection REALLY works great they just disable all your CD/DVD drives so you can't use them with ANY discs anymore - UNBELIEVABLE!!![...]"
2,Copy protection ruins another wonderful album,"I saw the video to Natasha Bedingfield's song ""These Words"" and immediately knew I had to learn more about this artist. The song had beautiful melodies, rhythm and a great hook that comes in at just the right place.[...]Regardless of how wonderful the remainder of the album sounds, because of the simple fact that I cannot listen to it on my iPod and in iTunes the album is completely useless to me. The only redeeming praise I will extend to Epic, is that on the back of the CD there is a clear notice stating what software and devices the album is compatible with - which would have been fair warning had I purchased the CD from a brick and mortar retailer. I only wish that Amazon.com included such information along with the track listing displayed of each album."
3,CD,"There are only 2 really good songs on the cd that I liked. If your not a fan, I would try something else."
3,Meh,"Natasha Bedingfield's debut album is an enigma. There is no denying the fact that her first hit, ""These Words,"" is worth your ten bucks, but does the rest of the CD live up to that standard? The answer is, unfortunately, no. The songs are good, but Natasha's beautiful voice is over-processed to the point that it is painful to listen to. It's true that you can't upload this CD to iTunes, but I was able to with my imported version, so buy that one if you do decide to invest in Nastasha Bedingfield."
1,COULD NOT PLAY - WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this ""CD"" and found that it cannot be played onanything I own. Anybody want it ? for free ?What a piece of TRASH. Apparently SONY has plans to do this to everything. NO MORE SONY FOR ME.I guess you need a brand new computer with lots of power, thenhave to load special software onto your computer just to listento disk. AND as stated by other reviewers, cannot play on Ipod.How DUMB!!"
3,Wild Horses...,"Wild Horses is the standout track on this album. It's wistful, self-reflective, wanting, regretful, scared. Beautiful melody and sung with great emotion. Excellent!"
4,Not half bad...,I was suprised how much I like this.... Some songs are a bit cheesy.... but overall good. In some songs Natasha reminds me on Pink. There are overall many songs worth buying this album for.
4,Refreshing,"This cd is really good. Natasha provides something new and unique to the music world. She blends a variety of song types throughout the cd and has very interesting lyrics. Her vocals go great with the beats too. She is definately not just the sister of Daniel Bedingfield. She came into her own with this cd. The sound is not your average pop album though, so only buy it if your up for something a little different. I highly reccomend it though!"
5,Well worth the wait,"I'd been anxiously awaiting this cd for quite some time, after hearing the single 'These Words' on the radio. I adored her brother Daniel Bedingfield's cd 'Gotta Get Through This', and hoped that they shared both tremendous talent and that delightful hint of foreign accent. The cd was everything for which I had hoped, and more! The timbre of her voice definitely contains a familial resemblance to her brother's. I was highly impressed by the variety and power of her songs. She surpasses the quality of everyday 'pop/rock/dance' music, and successfully delivers a gorgeous array of songs. Natasha well deserves the status she has gained in the international music sphere.The varying moods of the cd conveyed happy foot-tapping, haunting chills, and wistful desire. I give Natasha's debut album an *excellent* rating, and recommend that you get your own copy as quickly as possible!"
4,Pretty Good,"Natash Bedingfield is pretty good. Her music is real. It's alive. Not deep, soulful music, but still pretty good. Good for teen girls. The kind off music you listen to at a sleepover and all sing along to. Unwritten is the best, by far, but These Words (I Love You) is pretty good, too. Don't buy unless you're into the lipgloss, blonde hair, preppy but still really good kind of music. Not for punk-rockers or heavy metal fans."
4,Bring on the next single!,"This is such a good album and i was very pleased with it. unwritten is probably my most favourite track which we can all relate to, quoting'I am unwritten, can't read my mind, I'm undefinedI'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand, ending unplannedStaring at the blank page before youOpen up the dirty windowLet the sun illuminate the words that you could not findReaching for something in the distanceSo close you can almost taste itRelease your inhibitionsFeel the rain on your skinNo one else can feel it for youOnly you can let it inNo one else, no one elseCan speak the words on your lipsDrench yourself in words unspokenLive your life with arms wide openToday is where your book beginsThe rest is still unwritten.I also think the song writting in this is very good.So, to summerize, YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!!"
2,DONT BUY THIS VERSION !,"IF you plan to download to any IPOD or mp3 player..you won't be able to rip the CD. This totally ruined my experience. I rarely listen to CD's since I hate carrying all the bulk. I've stuck to my tried & true Sony Clie, which up until NOW, had all the capability of loading my personal music(of which I bought the CDs for). In addition, its really stupid to limit the player on a personal PC. What a total turn-off!"
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THIS CD FOR YOUR IPOD!,Sony failed to mention that this CD cannot be used in iTunes or the iPod so do not waste your money if you want to put these songs in your iPod like I did.
2,"Weaker than I expected, but the girl's got pipes!","Once again, I think the most radio friendly song was released and caught the attention of the public. That's great, except I don't think the rest of the cd matches the fun, catchy mood of ""These Words (I Love, I Love You)."" I found the lyrics trying too hard to be trendy or catchy. I didn't think the songs really said much, or stood well on their own. I was disappointed to be honest. I hope that she grows in her writing because she does have some strong vocals."
2,Disappointing Album,"I love the song ""These Words"" and was looking forward to this album release. I also love the album put out by Natasha's brother, Daniel. Unfortunately, this album turned out to be a big disappointment. ""These Words"" is the only song on this album to stand out or really maintain my interest. The writing on the songs is unimpressive and many of them sound alike. Perhaps it's unfair to compare this album to her brother's, but it lacks the creativity of Daniel's and is bland in comparison."
1,NOT iPOD COMPATIBLE,"THIS CD HAS ANTI-PIRACY SOFTWARE AND DOES NOT ALLOW IMPORTING WITH iTUNES. IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC ON iTUNES, WHICH IS WHY I BOUGHT THE CD, FORGET IT!!!!!!"
2,A Little Too Ambitious,"My best friend called me and said ""I just heard this song by a Natasha Bedingfield"" - she has satellite radio in her car. So after reading a great nod in Entertainment weekly I decided to purchase it. I ended up sending it to her. I felt the CD moved into such a hyped hip hop mess that it lost what was enjoyable as it began; the artist seemed to be trying to race into this hip hop melange of a mess of music which didn't suit her obvious talents. For GREAT pop music try the import ""TALLER ON MORE WAYS"" by ""THE SUGABABES"". No pretension and great pop - no one trying to be a white hip hop girl."
4,THUMBS DOWN FOR CONTENT PROTECTION,"As far as the music goes, this CD is a great debut attempt. I love most of the songs, and they're not sappy and boring like many of pop albums. However, the content protection REEKS. I had to rip the CD to my WMP, then burn it onto a blank CD, then upload it into my iTunes, so that I can listen to it. Or, I could just have broken the law and downloaded the illegal files. Why would they do this? Especially for someone's breakthrough CD... Bad, bad policy. Bad, bad Epic..."
4,i like this,"After hearing ""Unwritten"" way too many times on the radio i finally caved and bought this album. I like her positive vibe. It's growing on me!"
5,Stunning!!!,"OMG, so I got this for my b-day, and just started listening to it (listening to it now in fact!) I'm on the last song (wild horses) and I just discovered the hidden track! What a suprise! Okay, so about the CD. This is simply fabulous! A few songs are iffy (drop me in the middle, silent movie and if your gonna), but the rest of the songs are songs that get you hooked. Trust me, you should totally get this CD. You won't regret it."
3,"Great album, but not for iPod owners","I find this to be a great album, and on merits of the music alone, it would get higher marks from me. But a few stars have to be deducted from this particular edition because of the anti-pirating software included on the disc.It will play in any CD player, but your computer may not recognize it. My iTunes did not see it, nor did Windows Media Player. For the disc to play on your computer, you have to use the proprietary mini-player included on the disc.The software allows you to make up to four personal use copies of the CD (using its own mini-burner software), and allows you to rip the tracks to your computer. But the only formats available are WMA and ATRAC, neither of which will work on an iPod.If you have a Windows-compatible MP3 player, or you just plan on playing it in a regular CD player, then this edition is fine. But for iPod owners, I would recommend the DualDisc version, which apparently does not have this protective software included."
1,Talentless British girl singing boring music,"Hearing ""These Words"" (the most annoying song I've ever heard) being played on the radio constantly, I decided to listen to the rest of the album. It just goes downhill from there. I can't believe this girl even got a record deal. They must just be promoting her hoping her image will bring in $$$ for the record company. Don't waste your time/money with this."
5,Natasha Rocks,"I love Natasha Bedingfield. I got her CD from my sister. I love all the songs, my faves (hard to pick!) are These Words, Unwritten, Size Matters, I bruise easily and Wild Horses. I have her DVD, I recommend it to all 'Tasha fans. She is a fantastic signer. She knows what kind of music to do, she has a variety, love songs, dance, slow, all kinds!"
1,Sony Rootkit....Buyer Beware,"The infamous Sony Rootkit fiasco, detailed at http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html is present on this CD. I have confirmed its existence on a PC that played this disc and have a very high suspicion of it as the cause of many system instabilities on that PC (still under investigation).If you like the music and want to support Ms. Bedingfield, attend one of her concerts, but do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!Sony must be sent a message that their behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. In general, avoid all ""CONTENT/SOPY PROTECTED"" or ""ENHANCED"" discs. They can no longer be trusted from anyone, especially any Sony published discs."
1,Copy protection disaster!,"Sony/BMG really did it now. First, they have the gall to treat us like criminals by making their CDs copy-protected. Then, it was revealed that the software they use for copy protection is really spyware that can't be removed without ""blue-screening"" your PC. Now, virus writers have found a way to exploit this spyware, and they use it to break into firewalls and invade other people's computers. Thanks, Sony! These ass-clowns deserve to get SUED by California and New York and I hope the pay DEARLY for making my life as a music fan so horrible."
3,Good Manuka Honey,Taste and texture combine with health benefits. Natural anti inflammatory and anti bacterial. Raw stuff is better/ Good deal for money
5,Iced Earth's amazing rare stuff!,"This is really good songs you wont find anywhere else. Iced Earth are the kings of true metal. The EP starts with Melancholy, possibly the best ballad off Something Wicked This Way Comes, and possibly the best Iced Earth song yet. Then there is an amazing Bad Company cover of Shooting Star. I've heard the original before, and Iced Earth's version burns it too the ground. Then there's the very emontial Watching Over Me, which is the best Iced Earth song in concert. Great solo, great lyrics. It RULES! Then the classic Black Sabbath cover Electric Funeral from 1970's Paranoid. I never thought that they could do this, but it's amazing. I died for you is a great balld from The Dark Saga. Excellent intro! And, the Judas Priest classic, The Ripper, from sad Wings Of Destiny. Just perfect! And finally, the best way to hear them live, the live version of Colors from their first album! Such a great E.P.! I hope you like it too!"
2,He's okay!,"I heard the acoustic guitars and electric pop fun and assumed this would be an artist right up my alley. After his first song Can't Let Go, you feel ""eh, alright this guy's got some potential."" But, after ""Last Stop"", you start to feel that something's missing. That's what takes place over the rest of the album. He's a 3 trick pony. Open the mind of any young twenties single guy, give him a flair for John Mayer and a falsetto emulating Fran Healy of Travis and you end up with Landon Pigg. The musical ideas are there, but he lacks the soul of the artist. It's quite evident in the song writing. After those first two listenable tracks, I found myself skipping after 30 seconds of each song. Tinman's the only exception. That's a well written song, but he also doesn't even write his songs. He gets help from pop industry wizards. Do yourself a favor and pick up Travis's Boy with no Name or Death Cab for Cutie's Plans. Those are two albums with a similar vernacular but are far superior efforts."
4,Good Stuff,This is a pretty good album. Some quality rock/pop tunes without being cheesy. I'm surprised nobody else has put up a review yet.
4,Verry nice,"Outstanding, creative lyrics. I find myself humming many of the catchy tunes hours later. Good luck Landon."
4,Pretty Nice Sounding Indie Power Pop Sound,"This is the only material I've ever heard from L.P. In addition to describing the music on this CD as 'indie power pop', I'd also throw in 'progressive pop'. In terms of who he sounds like, I guess the only act I can think of right off the top of my head is the Irish progressive pop band Pugwash, with Thomas Walsh. Any fan of this CD may want to try out some Pugwash, which is great stuff. There is nothing really new sounding or groundbreaking here or deep about the music/lyrics, etc. And every song, if not sounding exactly alike, pretty much all sounds the same. However, it is still a nice, pleasant listen, if you are into the style or genre."
4,Well crafted pop,"Several Pigg tunes were playing on Sirius this morning in my local coffee shop. With each one, I thought ""who is this? It's really cool"". Finally Great Companion came on and I just had to make the trek back to the counter to ask who it was. Feels like an over-the-top pop version of Radiohead without the interesting noises. Great CD, in any case. Listen a couple of times before you dismiss it."
5,2000 watt with 4000 surge,I bought my coleman about 6 years ago. It has never failed. I used it for emergency power for my sump pump for years and it worked just fine. It is now in my boat to run the tv and micro wave.For the price I feel these are a very good buy.
3,it works but breaks easily,"It works nicely, looks good. The birds seem to perfer this style over the round dish style that screw on to soda bottles, at least the birds at my house. The stems break real easily due to being cheap plastic. the little finches and chickadees still use it with no problem even with the stems broken off."
3,Okay product.,"This product is a good idea, but it is easily broken. It is plastic after all. I would recommend the metal version which is almost identical and will hold up. The Soda Bottle Bird Feeders work well. I use them for Sun Flower seeds and the birds seem to love the seeds and use the feeders."
2,Product is Not what the picture shows,I ordered this item thinking that it looked like the picture on this page. The picture shows a green dish that holds water for birds that you use a plastic bottle to hold more water. What I received was a tiny bird feeder that maybe a finch could land on. I paid more for the shipping than the product which was my mistake. So returning this silly looking useless product would be more waste of money. I'm very unhappy.
5,hard to believe...,"Just the fact that it's 2002 and we have a new Crispy Ambulance album is incredible enough. Even more amazing is how great this album is. It's been said before but here C.A. seem to pick up right where they left off - the sound is fresh and new yet familiar at the same time. The songs themselves are among the strongest C.A's ever come up with - ""Re-Animator"" and ""Heatwave"" in particular. I just hope there's more where this came from!As a sidenote, if you don't have ""the plateau phase"", get that first. It is a masterpiece."
1,Forbidden City- Begiuin and Morel book bad for the money,"I was disappointed at the size of the book for the price. I've seen as the same, and as good historic photographs, on a bigger and better scale. Being in the printing business, I don't believe you take a maginificant picture and put it on the fold. Stupid for so so-called authors Beguin and Morel. Shame, shame, shame. Good subject, very bad presentation."
1,remanufactured product,"I bought a remanufactured Panasonic DMR-E75VS Progressive-Scan DVD Recorder/VCR Combo which came to me ... broken. The DVDtray was not going to open at all. I got really mad and depressed and sent it back. I got refund for this stuff and bought a new Panasonic DMR ES30VS, which is great."
1,ok for price,Unfortunately it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm not a fan of chokers that are set on memory wire. Very pretty but uncomfortable to wear. Elastic string would have been much better.
1,The Worst,This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film of all time. Not at all funny. Inane plot line. Chastized by idiotic neighbors because they wish to spend their Christmas together on a cruise. Then they fall all over themselves trying to organize the annual Christmas Eve party to indulge their spoiled rotten daughter (who I think left about 3 days earlier). Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not even worth the rental price let alone actually paying money for it.
1,Skip Christmas with the Kranks!!,"I rented this movie hoping for a nice, sweet holiday movie. What I got was an over the top, stupid unfunny holiday movie. From beginning to end, Christmas with the Kranks is not good and that is being nice. The movie begin with Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen taking their daughter who has just joined the Peach Corps to the airport. Since she won't be home with them at Xmas, they decide to go on a cruise. They tell everyone in the town (which seemed silly, why does everyone need to know?) and all the people they tell get mad!! The neighbors threaten them if they don't put up decorations, their friends pout because there will be no party and they are solicited over and over again to give moeny. I didn't see what the big deal was. So they were going on a cruise, who cares? It just didn't seem realistic. Then their daughter calls and decides to come home after all, so they decide to have Xmas. Don't waste your time or your money on this."
2,Rather Odd Christmas Movie,"I agree with the reviewer who called this slap stick silly.A couple sends their daughter off (I think to college or on a intership)so they decide since she is not going to be home for the traditional Christmas celebration that they would take the money that they would spend on Christmas and take a trip together. Well, OK there is certainly nothing wrong with that but what annoyed the heck out of me was why not just say you took the trip as a Christmas present instead of insisting your skipping Christmas. Taking a trip together shows courtship and compassion for one another, skipping Christmas on the other hand is not compassionate and grinch-like. So basically the whole movie is nothing other than the neighbors and co-workers highlighting how terrible the couple are for ""skipping Christmas"" and not carrying out the traditional celebration. The last 10 minutes or the ending if you will, was the only heart felt moment through the whole movie. Sorry, try again."
2,Not a very exciting Christmas.,"I rented and viewed this today, thinking it wouldn't be so bad. I was wrong. I was bored throughout almost the entire thing, especially the first 40 minutes. I even fell asleep before the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend this as a rental or to buy, there are plenty of movies more entertaining than this."
3,Typical holiday flick-too over the top,"Of course this genre is meant to inflect the sometimes ""hustle and bustle"" holiday season with laughter and humor, but this flick was a bit irritating.The premise was funny enough-a couple trying to spice things up, in the face of their daughter's absence during a trip to another country. But the film is monotonous and the script a bit campy.All actors do a fine job with the material given, but aside from the scene where the cruise tickets are given to the elderly couple across the street, the film lacks the genuine sentiments of other holiday films (such as ""The Holday"" and others). This does not have a hgh rewatchability factor for me, and I typically like holiday films. Give it a ""rent"" if you like the type."
3,Christmas with The Kranks,"I got this film for a whole penny. A national video chain was holding a great sale of movies for a penny and a dollar on Thanksgiving day. I viewed this movie before buying this dvd and I enjoyed the film. I watched it a few years later and I do not feel the same way, its still an enjoyable movie though. Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis skip Christmas for a year and everyone has a fit over it. Talk about respecting peoples privacy. Dan Akyroyd leds the neighborhood and trys to get them to understand why they'd do this. Its a great idea ruined by bad acting. If you enjoy films like Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Carol (various ones), Scrooged, Christmas Story, Home Alone to name a few then this one has a good idea but poorly executed. Not going be an annual viewing for any families around the world during Christmas."
3,Kinda Dull,"I bought this DVD, and I didnt wanan think negative about this movie cause it did looked good.I watched it I didnt wat to think bout it, i wanted to think positive and negative at the same time.Ok heres how I think, there were funny parts to this film, the Tim Allen bo tox scene and the Jamie Lee Curtis running for that ham.... those parts were funny but throughout the movie after they decided to skip Christmas it just got boring a lil bit and lil slow, it went no direction until the ending.Which I think the ending at the party saved the movie a little bit.So not a thumbs up movie for me but it was ok.Overall:3.0"
1,Merry Christ-MESS,"Yikes, this was, to be blunt, an awful movie. The ridiculous script has a plot that is simply an excuse to stage a load of of stupid sight gags and the only thing it does for the two stars, big ones I might add, is make them look ridiculous. Curtis and Allen do try but there is nothing to work with.If you want a good Christmas comedy, get Home Alone. That one is a gem.Darkhorse86"
1,Christmas with the kranks,The worst Christmas movie I have ever seen. I can't believe people would rate this as a 5 star. Obviously starved of good entertainment. This should come with a health warning.
2,"Boring, not 'The Santa Clause' Tim Allen we love","My collection of Christmas movies must unfortunately include this one, simply in that it IS a Christmas movie. That said, the beginning was extremely slow, there was plenty of opportunity for better jokes, more wit, etc...but just when you thought Tim would spout his sarcastic hilarity...*cricket sounds*. The last 20 minutes or so were acceptable, including the Christmas wonderland of the street, snow, houses with lights, etc...outside of that visual effect, definitely lacking. In the end, it IS a Christmas movie and it IS for the Holiday season so it's hard to hate it, still, I think it'll be down near the end of my collection."
3,semi-good,"It was an okay movie. There were a few spots where i laughed, but i read one review and i totally disagree. She said it was the worst movie ever, and it wasn't that bad. It starts out with two parents and a daughter, the daughter left for the peace corps. This would be the couples first christmas without their daughter and they decided to avoid missing her they would just skip christmas. Luthor suggests they go on a cruise and the mother agrees. They go through tons of trouble avoiding celebrating christmas but on christmas eve their daughter calls and says shes coming home with her fiance. They immediatly begin decorating and planning a christmas eve party, the daughter arrives and they celebrate. Luthor gives the cruise tickets to an elderly couple to enjoy, the wife had cancer and was dying sometime in the next year probably."
1,Easily one of the worse movies I have ever seen.,"I thought this would be a silly, kinda dumb, but cute little movie with a few laughs and some Christmas fun. I was wrong. Right off the bat, Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are totally unbelievable as a couple. And, while I can usually stand him pretty well, and I usually like her -- they just did not work in this movie. Her acting is especially poor. While I'd say that is the film's first flaw -- it is only one of many. The movie is just not good. I love movies. It's very rare that I will say this about a movie -- but I hated it. If you want to see a funny Christmas movie, I'd suggest ""Scrooged"" with Billy Murray or ""Elf."" Christmas With the Kranks is easily in the top 3 worst movies I have ever seen. Do not buy or rent this movie."
3,Better than expected,"First, I would like to say that I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. I read Skipping Christmas for about three Christmas' in a row before this year when I recently watched Christmas with the Kranks. I expected it to be the quality of a straight-to-video movie with no style whatsoever.However, my entire family liked it as I watched it with them, especially my mother who doesn't understand English all too well. It's nice seeing Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis again after seemingly so long. They fit very well in the nice little film.*SEMI-SPOILER*I think the movie should have been about 10 to 15 minutes longer to help you really appreciate what the neighbors did for the Kranks near the end. Because of it's short length, it just seemed too unbelievable. But it was still nice to see it all happen.The is a movie I would rent to check it out if I haven't seen it yet."
3,THE KRANKS SKIP CHRISTMAS,"This is one of the ""nastiest"" Yuletide movies made. On one hand, we have the Kranks (Tim Allen in a completely joyless performance and Jamie Lee Curtis trying too hard to be funny) who have decided to ""skip Christmas"" and go on a cruise since their daughter has joined the Peace Corps and Christmas just won't be the same without her. On the other hand, we have the neighbors who insist that the Kranks maintain their Christmas traditions in spite of their wishes to skip the holiday. While I feel it's no one's business to dictate how someone spends their holiday, Allen's complete self-serving attitude doesn't bring us into his corner either. Unfortunately, the movie has few real laughs and it's only it's sentimentally contrived third act that manages to save the movie and bring some sense of holiday joy to its close and enable me to give it a three star rating; but it's not a movie I'd want to watch every Christmas; it's just too mean-spirited overall."
3,Christmas with the Kranks,"The movie itself is fine, however inside the box that contains the DVD it is broke and doesn't hold the movie in place. Which means the movie was bounced around during shipping. I haven't watched the whole thing but it doesn't appear to be damaged."
1,Worst part about Xmas....,...God awful Xmas themed movies!Nice to see Tim Allen is off the sauce though.
3,Could have been great,What a shame to take the wonderful story of John Grisham's Skipping Christmas and turn it into a slapstick comedy. Tim Allen was not the one to play Luther Crank. Do yourself a huge favor and read the book!
3,$@%*ed Up,"This movie is really bad. I mean, its a little funny but it is so not realistic and plus, you know how in the preview they show him all tanned ""I got a botox injection"", they dont go to Hawaii, they just stay home."
3,Pleasant but not laugh out loud funny,This was just ok. There was nothing offensive in the movie and there were even a few humorous moments but nothing laugh out loud funny. I really love movies that have you rolling and had hoped this would be one. It did after all have Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen in it so you'd think it would have been darn funny. There were some cute moments but all in all it was not a movie I'd consider to be a repeat. A Christmas Story is a movie I can literally watch every single year and still find pretty darn funny! Still it's worth the viewing just to support Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress. Not too many actresses out there like her that can also be admired and respected for being so pro-family. She's very family friendly and writes great children's books plus she looks darn good for having had no plastic surgery and doesn't mind showing her gray!
3,Skip This Movie,"The Kranks are having that empty nest feeling for the first time this Christmas - so to help themselves out, Mr. Krank decides to take them both on a wonderful 10 day cruise for Christmas instead of doing the regular holiday schtick. Frankly, what woman wouldn't love that? I know I would...So to save up money for this trip, they forego the traditional cards, presents, tree, etc, and basically just tell folks Merry Christmas and we'll see you next year. You would think they admitted to being Satanists and that God was dead. They are ostracized by neighbors, coworkers, so-called friends. The neighbors all whisper about how 'selfish' they are being. This movie is bad on so many levels. If you've read the book that the movie is based on, I don't recommend renting this movie. It's a real letdown."
4,"Good movie, much better book","I liked the movie but not nearly as well done as the book,there was just a different feeling to t.I really dont expect a movie to have the details a book can but it could be a little closer than this.The Krank's daughter, Blair, is going someplace Christmas holiday. The dad, Luther, [Tim Allen] decides to skip Christmas and go on a cruise, because, without her, Christmas won't be the same. The wife, Nora [ Jamie Lee Curtis], decides to do that too. But the neighborhood is filled with Christmas-loving people that are PO'd to see them skipping Christmas. Later, they learn Blair is coming home for Christmas tonight. So they have to prepare the house for Christmas"
3,"Okay, it's a comedy ... or is it?","Tim Allen is the funny guy with the usual funny faces, but with only a very few new comedic ideas. Jamie Lee is there but it won't be another ""Friday."" Let's put it this way: while the concept behind the story is acceptable, the execution of it, which is not that easy to do, just doesn't seem to work and the flick is trying too hard to be funny. Sure, there are a few laughs here and there and my wife e.g. loved the movie, and she said it was really funny. But the bottom line is that my holiday season would have been just as funny without ever seeing this movie. Maybe my expectations were just a bit too high."
1,Big dissapointment,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I was so excited to see Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis because I think they are both very good actors. And of course the commercials on TV looked like it would be great movie but once again (as movie people do so often) all the funny parts (2 or 3 of them) were shown in the commercials! Wow was I disappointed! This has go to be the worst film either one of them have done! Talk about slow,boring and dull! I wasted my money seeing in the theater, won't be wasting it buying it for home viewing!"
5,Great product,Movie is in great condition. No scratches were on the disc. Case in good condition also.
2,Its definitely a rental,Not that funny but its a definitely a movie rental not good enough to want to buy. Its not that funny.
1,UnBox Does not work,"The download takes forever !Once it downloads the previews play fineIf you try to view the movie the Rights Manager takes over and prevents a successful viewing. Windows has changed the format of the electronic media Rights manager. Some can recover with multiple ""HOT FIXES"" others can not.Take a chance. Roll the dice - Maybe you will be lucky"
5,Great family movie,This is a great family movie. I bought it to watch with my granddaughters and 16 family members all sat together watching it..
4,I read the book!,"The movies can almost never be better than our imaginations, Juraisic Park may be the one contradiction. This movie is funny and the acting is ""okay"". I would have used Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver and it would have been a bit more believable. Again, I want to thank Amazon.com for making these items available. I'm busy working and serving commitments for the most part so, shopping is difficult, except for online with Amazon. THX!"
3,Silly movie,This movie is okay. Definitely not one of Tim Allen's best. If you can get it cheap then purchase it. It will make you laugh..
3,"Good, but not the funniest Tim Allen I've seen","Was a good movie, but not as funny as some of Tim Allen's other stuff. A good family flick, but don't expect to laugh quite as much as on Home Improvement."
3,Cranks not all it's cranked up to be,Except for Tim Allen's usual slapstick antics and one liners this is a lack luster comedy. It's worth the watch but I wouldn't add it to my library.
2,"Slapsticky, silly, simplistic","Too much falling and screaming... Unbelievable, uninvolving scenarios...Annoying neighbors from hell...all the things a Christmas movie doesn't need. I thought it might be good because of good ol' Jamie Lee Curtis and even Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle (Eric Per Sullivan). Sadly, all the actors' talents are wasted. If a Christmas-themed movie is called for, re-rent your favorite holiday standard instead. Or, read a good story aloud!"
2,ALLEN @ HIS WORSE OR A DULL MOVIE,The Krank's daughter leaves for South America with the Peace Core:Just after Thanksgiving.So the couple decides too skip-Chrismas and take a cruise too the Carribean.Whats wrong with that?Well- the nosey butitsky neighbor hood will not hear of this-thus starts a long rang of herassment.And so the movie goes until the daughter decides too return home Then in true x-mas spirit The town pitches in too get ready for the very short notice of return of the daughter.Oh yah Santa drops by too.I felt I was mislead by the previews-and very disapointed-beging a fan of Allens work sence H.Improvement:This movie was a big let down.
2,Don't Spend Your Christmas With the Kranks,"How sad it is, when a beauty of a book (Skipping Christmas) by an acclaimed author (John Grisham) is turned into a mess of a movie, it's only purpose being to rob hard-working people of their well-earned money. In watching this, I realized only one thing: Jamie Lee Curtis is getting old. She has gray hair. When did this happen?! This is a great example of a movie straining too hard to be funny. I felt like the Botox scene dragged on too long, and it was in the trailer so if you've seen the trailer you've seen basically that whole scene. Just don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it at all! If you're looking for a good Christmas movie for your family, try A Christmas Carol, A Christmas Story, (catch it anytime of the day you like Christmas day) or It's a Wonderful Life. And remember: It will be a Merry Christmas just as long as you don't spend it with the Kranks! Happy Holidays. Please rate if this review was helpful to you! Thanks!!"
1,Nothing new here.,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Christmas!!! I'm one of the people who puts thousands of lights up. I love Christmas music and of course Christmas movies, the best being Christmas Vacation with Elf coming in a close second. Tim Allen's Santa Clause movies are also pretty good as are the old classics. I was really hoping Christmas with the Kranks would be another great movie but it was pretty much a let down. It was kind of like a cheap rip off of Christmas vacation in a couple of ways. There are definitely better movies to buy."
1,A frenzy of tragically bad slapstick,"This film pretends to be all about the warm glow of love for humanity we're all supposed to feel over the holidays, but ends up reaffirming that the trappings and superficialities of the holiday season are what really matter. Apparently the makers of this film were not aware that bullying people into conforming to neighborhood standards of Christmas celebration does not represent goodwill to all. A few of the situations might have presented good comic opportunities in more careful hands, but this film ends up feeling superficial and forced throughout, with a completely patronizing ""moral"" at the end."
2,"THIS IS NO ""CHRISTMAS VACATION""","I rented this movie because with my wife we like to watch Christmas-themed movies during the holidays. So we go with ""Christmas with the Kranks"". Everything seemed to be right: Tim Allen (funny guy), Jamie Lee Curtis (funny gal), Dan Aykroyd (another funny guy). But this movie sucked. Why? Tim and Jamie where at their annoying best. So where Dan and the rest of the neighbors. I just wanted to smack them around. Very irritating. The only good thing about this movie is the last 30 or so minutes, with the Christmas spirit that involves everybody, including the obnoxious Tim and an old lady with cancer. Isn't that sweet? In the end, if you want to see the overbloated (like a beached whale) bodies of Tim Allen (in a speedo) and Jamie Lee Curtis (in a bikini), go for it..."
1,Simply awful,"I loved the book ""Skipping Christmas"" by John Grisham so much that I read it two Christmas's in a row. I was really excited when I heard they were making it into a movie. All I can say is, I hope somebody from the movie apologized to John Grisham. Other than the fact that in both the movie and the book, the couple decided to skip Christmas until they found out their daughter was coming home after all, there was nothing in common. The personalities of the couple in the book were completely different than the zany (translate: painfully tiresome and completely obnoxious) Kranks in the movie. READ THE BOOK! It is excellent and such a pleasant surprise from John Grisham. Just try really hard not to picture Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen when you read it."
1,Not what I expected,I had high expectations to seeing this movie thankfully I work at the movies so I didnt have to pay. I had high expectations because Tim Allen and Dan Akroyd and Cheech Marting those guys are funny. I figure that Allen being in another Christmas movie thats cool I mean Santa Cluase and Santa Cluase 2 both were great movies. But there were like 2 or 3 parts that made me laugh other than that I was dissapointed in it. The ending was the best part of the movie and also Julie Gonzalo is hot. Other than that it wasn't a good movie and I highly don't recommend it.
1,Great if you think Christmas is about bullying,"The movie is about a middle aged couple who decide to 'skip Christmas' and go on a cruise.When their neighbours find out the couple is relentlessly bullied and harrassed.It is disgusting, I hate seeing people being bullied.The movie has a supposed 'happy' ending, because they give in to their neighbours' demands and the neightbours reward their submission with 'kindness' BLARG.I would've enjoyed the ending immensly if it included scenes with a U-Haul truck because they were moving away from their hideous (and very nasy) neighbours."
1,A Stinker for Christmas,"Christmas With The Kranks is high on my list of WORST holiday movies. It is unfunny and filled with unpleasant people. So what if a family decides to go on a cruise instead of going over the top in celebrating Christmas? I started out rooting for Luther Krank because his neighbors were so profoundly obnoxious and interfering! Then he too becomes a miserable person...Finally once the Kranks decide to conform and hold Christmas after all, the neighbors are helpful and sweet! I'm amazed at how many people are calling this movie sweet and wholesome. I found it unfunny and actually rather unsettling. Heaven forbid a non-Christian ever move onto THAT block!Go watch A Christmas Story instead!"
1,Kranky after watching this movie!!,"This movie is based on the book, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS which is an excellent book. It is funny and heartwarming and actually has a point that Christmas is more than just about the decorations (even though I love decorations!). It is about family and having the chance to be together. I do wish they had wanted to donate the money they were saving to a homeless shelter or food bank and then do something that made a difference during the Christmas season other than plan a cruise, but I guess that is too much to ask.The movie is so stupid...the botox injections...seriously? The part where Luther has something special and Nora is practically tearing her clothes off...give me a break!You really need to read the book and if you can, LISTEN to the book! It is hilarious! I drive a semi and I was laughing so hard I woke my husband up who was sleeping in the back!Great book! Movie sucks!"
1,this film needed two laugh tracks,"Tim Allen&Jamie Lee Curtis have made some films over the years where I would at least laugh 2-3 times through out,but this Soggy Film is dull&Bland. very predictable&never gets off the ground to me at all.Christmas with the Hacks should have been the title."
2,No no no NOOOO,"I fell asleep, I turned it off well before it was over. I read the book before viewing the movie and maybe that is why? Though I cannot say I even enjoyed the book all that much and I like Grishm. I found the actors medicore, I found the movie NOT at all funny. And I found it overall boring and dull!!! Pick another movie for the holiday comedy...NOT this one!"
5,Christmas with the Kranks,Great movie! Funny and with a great Christmas message. We have watched this movie several times and we don't get tired of it!
2,christmas will be kranky if u c this,"i saw this movie and thounght the plot was boring!! it startd off ok but then got realy repeative and did the same thigs over and ova again. dont c this film its a waste go c sumtin else, oh yeh as if the o street would help them out especcialy when the kranks betrayed all of them"
1,See this movie at your own risk.,"This movie was the worst christmas movie myself and my friends have ever seen. From the start of the movie to the end it was an agonizing event. The acting was poor, and the storyline was non-existent. It was a waste of our money and we should have left, but we stayed hoping it would get better. It never did. From the grocery store incident, to the frosty's on the roof this movie had it's many flaws. As a comedy the jokes fell flat, and as a Christmas Story there was no magic at all. Please take my word for it this is a movie that you want to avoid at all costs.Pros - NoneCons -Bad Acting, direction, and script caused this movie's numerous flaws."
1,Waste of film!!! Idiotic!!!!,"After about 20 or 30 minutes I was praying for the time to pass by quickly so this crap movie would be over. There wasn't anything funny at all in the first 25 minutes, then, they tried to be funny the rest of the movie but I didn't laugh one time. This is by far the worst movie that Tim or Jamie have ever been in. I just donated this dvd to my library and good riddance!!!!!!"
3,"OK, but book is better - much better","I was first introduced to this wonderfully tender book by John Grisham back in 2001. However, I do not enjoy the movie nearly as much as the book itself.What was tender humor in the book became a bit slapstick in the movie, even though the plot is very close to the original book.The basic idea is that once their daughter leaves home, Luther Krank decides to get away from the ice and snow. His solution? By not spending money on Christmas, he can save enough to go to the Caribbean. Unfortunately, his neighbors don't like this departure from the norm.Perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't fallen in love with the book, but for me, the movie came out a mediocre."
3,"Amazon video doe snot work on all smart tv's. If you know that, you can save money!!!","I rented this video to watch with my family on my mothers new smart tv. I was able to find the video and pay for it, but it WOULD NOT play on her tv so I paid for the rental but never got to watch the movie!! Be sure that your tv works with amazon video before paying for any videos!!!"
3,so-so,"Unfortunately for anybody that watches this movie, a half-way decent premise is destroyed by hallow acting, shallow writing and is frankly just unable to become anything more than it is. It does not even aspire to become something great. It's just so-so."
1,Do Not Bother,"It sucked. Nobody acts like this in real life. Well, maybe a few, but not a whole community. Don't rent this"
2,2 And A Half Stars,"I went into this movie expecting the best. Tim Allen is always enjoyable, and he always puts out a feel good movie. Although Allen was excellent, and this movie did make me feel good, Allen could not cover for all the characters, including Dan Akyroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jake Busey. Beside's Cheech Marin, there were NO other funny or good characters. The somewhat creepy music just got irritating, and all of the funny parts were in the commercial. Just because a movie delves in a few gut chuckles, that doesn't mean it's funny. This is a disgraceful, barely passable Christmas comedy, that just didn't do it for me. Do me a favor, get some popcorn, go to your local video store, And just rent Elf, with Will Ferrell. NOW THAT IS A CHRISTMAS MOVIE! And, if you're looking for another excellent Tim Allen Christmas film, watch The Santa Clause, 1994, again. It'll sure please the fourth time more than Krank's will the first."
3,What we all feel like doing at some point.,"Skipping Christmas. It is a feeling that we all have at some point in our life. This was good but not at good as I thought it would be. I'll probably watch it again and again, but do not enjoy as much as some of my other Christmas movies."
2,youre adverage christmas movie,"With high expectations I went out and bought this movie and was a little disapointed. The movie has a all star cast that, the script lets down. The Kranks chose not to celebrate christmas with the absence of their daughter, leading to the anger of the neighbourhood. At the last minute the daughter desides to come home for christmas and suprise suprise the neighbourhood helps the kranks get ready. This movie is a rent before buy, the story is more suited to a midday telemovie than a over-rated blockbuster."
3,Christmas Spirit,"I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I have read the book, Skipping Christmas, which I enjoyed very much. I felt that Jamie Lee Curtis did not play her usual self. Tim Allen was funny, however not as funny as he could have been. I would not pay to see this movie again."
4,One of the BEST christmas movies,"LOVED IT!!!!!!!! it was so good. i love it, I bought it as soon as it came out. it was really funny. It was about a couple(Tim Allen, Jaime Lee Curtis) wants to skip christmas to go on a cruise, but the neighbors are angry and try everything in there power to make them celebrate christmas."
2,Not the best Christmas movie...,"This movie is OK at best. Its definitely not going to make the Christmas Classic status. You can see that the subject matter has great potential, however it was just plain lacking. Its amusing, but not laugh out loud funny. Its worth renting, but not buying. There are too many other classic Christmas movies out there to watch rather than spending a night with this one."
4,"A frosty, funny delight!!!!","The holidays take a turn for the worst this Christmas. Director Joe Ruth manages to bring Scrooge and Mrs. Clause together in this hilarious story about two people who try to do the impossible. And, no one could do this better then Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. What starts off as a great idea soon turns into a frosty nightmare as Mr. and Mrs. Krank attempt to skip Christmas? Their neighbors are, of course, not pleased. Who would think of such an idea? I don't think there was one flaw in this one. From start to finish, it is very funny. I definitely enjoyed it. Who would think that Tim Allen would turn out to be the bad Santa? Jamie Lee Curtis really stole the show, though. This really is a Christmas movie like no other. So, if you have nothing to do this holiday season you should go see it!"
4,Funny movie,This is a funny movie and has a good ending. It is a little hard to skip Christmas but good try.
4,Start Here,"Being a military wife for almost 10 years, I make an effort to assist new military spouses adjust to and learn about military life. I decided to read this book so I could recommend it to others and I even learned a few things! It gives practical information for not only new military spouses, but for everyone wanting to find out more about military life. I wish I had this book when I first got married! The tips, resources, and bibliographies are extremely useful and the anecdotes add a personal touch. Well done!"
1,Should be called SooperSucker,"This product is horrible, it sucks! Don't waste your time. If you try to sweep up anything that is not %100 level (most concrete sidewalks and driveways) it will do a nose dive on you. Then you get smacked in the chest with the handle. Ouch! I returned this thing the same day I received it."
3,The Swooper Is Sooper!!,"I really like my SooperSwooper! The color I received is bright yellow. My driveway isn't level but if I go over the dips/bumps at an angle it usually goes over them without stopping. The Swooper is actually kind of fun to push around! I am really glad I bought this it saves alot of time. It sweeps up the dirt and debris better than a pushbroom, the only thing that it has trouble picking up is pine needles... They tend to get stuck in the front brushes and will sometimes come back out. If I sweep up the pine needles, I have to empty the bin more to keep them from coming back out or if you take a rod (end of rake) and compact them down it keeps them from coming back out, you can also pack 3 times more leaves and debris in there too!. It really does do a good job sweeping up the dirt especially in the garage where it's all level and smooth. Does great for an edge sweeper too like along a fence line or lawn."
5,"Bond, James Bond","What can I say; I'm a bond fan and needed three movies to complete my set - Sean Connery was my favorite Bond but I needed ""A View to a Kill"" with Roger Moore as one of the three."
4,replacement holster,"As manufacturers do, the model phone I purchased over two years ago is ""no longer supported"" which means that accessories are also in short supply. I finally broke the manufacturers standard holster (I average about one a year) and didn't know where to turn. The replacement was not as fancy but has turned out to be very serviceable and I am quite pleased. It was a very good fit, both on my belt and for the phone itself and has withstood the rigors of my life very satisfactorily. I would not hesitate to buy from these folks again...all I need to do is keep my phone working another year or so..."
4,Creamer,"The liquid creamers are the best, but in a pinch or when traveling, the powdered creamers are pretty good. The Sugar Free Vanilla Caramel is almost too sweet though."
2,Tastes Great - Bad Filling,"This stuff tastes great but after doing some research, it's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy. The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils. If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor..... Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers. Godspeed."
2,Love the product but overpriced,"This is my favorite creamer, but I bought before checking prices. Could have saved $3 at Walmart."
3,Love the Splenda,I love the fact that you can get this product with Splenda. Wish they offered other flavors with Splenda . Now if they could cut down onthe oil it would be a great product.
5,i want to hang out with olly and suzi,"Simply put, this is an extraordinary book. A friend gave it to me and I do not know whether it is more a art, travel, nature, wilderness adventure, or photography book, because it defies classification, but in any event, it is a serious page-turner. I dont know where to start...the images from all over the coolest and most exotic places on earth, of some of the funkiest and loveliest paintings ever, are captivating. These guys live most children's dreams, they travel around, hang out with rare species of animals (some dangerous, some not), paint them and then get the animals to interact with the art - so they are at one with nature, creating stunning images and at the same time living at one with nature. A perfect gift for kids, visual artists, performance artists, photographers, or people with a sense of adventure or wanderlust."
2,A Real Disappointment,"As far as I'm aware this album did not go on general release in Europe, so when I found it as a US import I jumped at the chance to buy it, as Between The 1 And The 9 is one of my top three albums of all time (one of those which you can listen to over and over and over and over and never grow tired of...).Although music critics generally seem enthusiastic about Rothberg's new album, suggesting that she shows a more mature approach, I have to say I was really disappointed. It might well be more complex, but the sound was rough and harsh, while the lyrics were almost indistinguishable - and those that weren't, were distinctly uninspiring.I'm sure this album will win her a lot of new fans, but I advise old fans who buy Candelebra Cadabra that this album takes you on a completely different trip - and not one that I personally enjoyed.A real let down after Between The 1 And The 9."
2,Not very sharp,Purchased for use on a smaller dog breed. Found the blades to be pretty dull and poor quality. Will be looking at something else to replace.
1,Not recommended,I was hopeful that these scissors were okay despite the mixed reviews. Unfortunately they did not cut the hair of my maltese at all. Have to return.
5,Great shears,"I use these on our shih tzu, they work great on rounding the puppy cut near the face. I have been pleased with all of the miracle coat shears."
4,great for cutting hair in between paws,Great for trimming hair in between toes of the paw (Miniature Schnauzer). Not so great for trimming ears. Would want longer scissors for that.
1,Looks like I was sent used ones,"Don't waste your money..these things look and feel like they have been used, returned and re-sold to me.....sending them back for a new pair..."
4,Mel Bay's Flamenco Guitar : Basic Techniques (Technicas Basi,"The exercises are a good supplement if you are using another method book. It does not include enough explanatory material if you are using it as your sole method. The section on tremelo, for example, could use explanation. The photographs and exercises for rasgueo are very good. The included pieces are not for complete beginners, though the exercises seem like they would be useful to master or practice for all levels - some of the exercises are not easy but make a notable difference in your ability to play once they are mastered. All the exercises and pieces are on the CD. The CD has only the music with no explanations or verbal text which is advantagous when you just need to hear the music example. This is a book which could be useful to a player for a long time I think."
1,Not recommended for self taught beginners,"This book would make a good supplement to someone taking lessons from a flamenco guitarist. This is not a good book for someone trying to learn this on their own. The right hand techniques of flamenco are syncopated and require the right form from day one.Only if someone has the correct technique can they ever dream of achieving the speed needed to play a flamenco soleas.Flamenco guitar is the most demanding of all acoustic guitar techniques for the right hand, I would recommend Juan Martin or Herrera's videos to learn flamenco. You need to see the techniques to really understand how to execute them"
3,"Older book, not for beginner","It may be my bad, my lack of doing enough research before ordering this book, but it is an older book and definitely not for the beginner. Bought this for my husband who is re-learning guitar and wants to learn flamenco. This book is a little too much to start. Although, Mel Bay does awesome teaching books, best around. Most of his books are very user friendly and easy to understand with illistrations and common-sense explanations. Many also come with CD's and/or DVD's to compliment the book, which is so great. So not a bash on Mel Bay books in general. Just an older, more advanced book than I thought it would be. Probably my bad."
3,Inappropriate for self taught learners,"Not for self taught learners, simply because the 'rasgueado' variation used in the book demands acurate guidance from someone of experience in flamenco guitar playing, as neither the book, nor the dvd(sold separately) by the same author explain in refined details the 'subtleties' of this all down strokes(five) with four fingers rasgueado.The book though of pertinence to the 'roots' of flamenco guitar, goes too fast into advanced techniques without proper preparatory right hand exercises, which can be confusing.., for someone born/raised in flamenco tradition it might be obvious, but not for someone uninitiated.For someone who just want to play a few pieces for fun and to get an idea what flamenco guitar is about, i will counsel something lighter and more straightforward in technical contents, like: 'You Can Teach Yourself Flamenco Guitar'."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed to find that this book doesn't include any significant instruction or commentry from the author. The nearest thing to a discussion on technique is a very brief section on 'rasqueado' with ridiculously tiny photos. The CD is practically useless as there are no introductions before each track to indicate which pieces they relate to in the book.Not recommended.
1,Propaganda.,"I saw this fellow speak about his supposed experiences with German Neo-Nazis at Kenyon College in 1999 and he was a very effective and highly impassioned speaker. At the time I was impressed. As I look back on the experience now, however, I feel emotionally manipulated. Must everything be as melodramatic as a Hollywood movie?The relation of his climactic moment with the snuff film reminds me of a bow on a neatly-wrapped package. Too convenient, in my opinion. The implication that watching children murdered is the ultimate extension of an interest in Nationalism is ridiculous.He just chose to pursue the most twisted people he could find, without giving any objective information on the vast majority of moderate Nationalists."
2,Disappointing For Serious Readers,"This is not a serious expose of the Neo-Nazi movement in Germany, it's simply a play by play of Savoray's adventures within the movement, and it doesn't even do that very well.It's easy reading, I'll give it that, in fact it reads like a dime store spy novel. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, and maybe it's even based on real events, although the word for word exchanges stretch credibility pretty far. Those looking for mind candy should consider it, but those looking to learn about the actions and motivations of Neo Nazi's should look elsewhere."
1,A cell phone that works would be worth the money,"First problem: Phone kept refusing to read SIM card, eventually had to place a small piece of paper between battery and card to hold it securely enough. Second problem: after one month of use the applications began freezing and dropping calls. Had to turn on and off to even use it. What did Nokia say? ""Sorry."" DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS PRETTY!!!!"
5,Great phone,I like nokia 7370. It looks great and is pretty reliable. The two things that Nokia could improve would be volume and reception. Rather than that phone is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to have this fashion peace in their pocket.
1,terrible,"Product came damaged! Packaging damaged, product description was semi-accurate however product not compatible for use in UNITED STATES! Phone would cut on but no features or service would work! Return process was a nightmare! I returned the product immediately for a exchange & never received new product, attempted to contact seller multiple times before person reached! After 2 months finally received refund for purchase price only!"
1,"There is a ""war"" going on.","This book even nonsence can be dangerous because includes fear and incorrect action. The fear can cause people to have accidents, some of them fatal. It's the same situation as with an hallucination-what's hallicinated isn't ""there,"" but the illusion that is in this book can bring about te same consenquences as if it were. People become sick, or have lost friends or possessions, or have in turn brought injury to others s the result of reading or beliving in, what is later found to be an illusion. This book is just war of psychic disease.If you read Geller's books you will experience Correct knowledge, they can also protect you from false perception of the world around you.STUDY POINTS."
1,What a joke,"This drive kit is so unstable!!If you can get it to boot and see the hard drive. You better do what you need FAST, the thing will loose the hard drive faster then you can walk into the other room after a reboot.If bill gates finds out about this he might want to stick a Microsoft sticker on the linux build that this Nas Drive runs.Lets hope they get a new firmware out FAST!!!Version 1.03 is better then the new 1.04 version. Dont upgrade to 1.04!!"
1,Lousy (non-existent) customer support,"The fact that this is sold at Frys Electronics should have made it suspect to begin with. The installation disk bombed out on the first computer because of an active-x problem. I did get the software installed on a second machine. But there is no way to add a user (that button is grayed out).But the worst part is the NON-EXISTENT customer support. Maybe they shut down over the period between Christmas and New Years, but if so you would thing at least one person in the ""company"" would have thought to record this message. Two days during ""normal business hours"" according to them and NOTHING. Even their sales offices are closed.My advice -- stay away from this product and anything else ADS Tech is peddling."
1,Lost my money,"I'm an experimented computer user and I had a lot of problems with my NAS drive kit, P2P doesn't work, web is too slow, sharing over the network has a lot of problems and ADS Tech has no support to this.Really is a shame because the interface is really nice but doesn't work.I think I lost my money buying this."
4,Coin Slots,"I was very pleased with the product and the cost of the item. However, I feel that a serious adjustment should be made for the postage charged as it was way out of line. The charge for postage make the cost for the item too expensive. The item could have been sent via USPS Flat Rate at a more resonable cost."
1,NEVER GOT IT,"THANKS TO UPS AND THEIR SCREWED UP DELIVERY POLICIES, I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM I PURCHASED. I AM UNABLE AT THIS TIME TO REVIEW THE ITEM, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT!!!! MAYBE AMAZON SHOULD CHOOSE SOMEONE ELSE FOR THEIR DELIVERY COMPANY, LIKE FEDEX, OR THE USPS. ALL I KNOW IS I'M OUT $43.00 AND NO PRODUCT! THANK YOU"
1,keeps reseting itself,"i actually got this from audiohollics a little under a month back. I was going to just get a regular surge supressor for my new home theater setup in my bedroom but decided to get one of these since they were on sale. The work in the bedroom this is going into is taking longer than it should so i figured i should test it out. I pluged it in the spare bedroom im sleeping in and it doesn't seem to work right. It only has a 32"" tv, a ps2, and laptop plugged into it and it seems to randomly turn itself on and off for several minutes. as if its overloading or something over and over again. I checked the outlet, I double checked that the polarity wasn't reversed, that the neutral wire was fine, and that the ground was ok.It all checked out. Either this things a giant piece of junk or i have a defective one. Either way, unimpressed. Im going to try to send it back since im almost at the 30 days"
1,"Randomly resets itself, won't turn on.","I bought this APC device and didn't get the opportunity to use it immediately due to a move. Unfortunate for me! By the time I got it set up and working, I was out of my return window. The device would randomly reset itself. Recently, the power button broke, and now I have to lean on the button as hard as I can to get the unit to turn on, but the moment I let go, it turns back off. I rarely write reviews, but with only one other review on this device, I felt I should say something to be sure NOBODY buys this thing. I ended up just ordering a Belkin surge protector for far less, and I have not noticed any differences in the quality of A/V from my stereo receiver, plasma tv, blu-ray player, or xbox360. Don't buy this device."
5,"Nice Camera, Great Picture Quality...","I received this camera for my birthday last week and I simply love it. It is very user friendly and easy to understand. The quality of pictures that this thing produces are just great. I will admit the the flash recycle time may take 2-3 seconds but its really nothing to get worked up about unless you take alot of pictures at night or really dark places. Me, I just snap pictures of my 2 year old son outdoors in the day and in the house under regular and dim lighting conditions and the pictures are always about 90% acceptable. Considering this is Not a $800+ dollar Digital SLR camera, this is a pretty good percentage in my opinion."
4,Canon has another winner!,"If you want more zoom than 3x (this one has 6x optical), if you want small size, if you want more than 5 megapixels (this one has 6), if you want a viewfinder, if you want good quality, this is the camera to buy! I have other VERY fine Nikon Digital SLR's but they weigh a TON. I travel a lot and want to take great pictures, this little gem fits the bill. As far as I can tell so far (I have had the camera just over a month) the only draw back is that it does not come with a rechargeable battery pack. (You can use rechargeable AA's) But given the other features, I will live with it! I am picky and I looked all over and this was the only camera that fit almost all my requirements."
5,Great value for some well spent money,"I am as I call myself an ""advanced amateur"" photographer and own an SLR for those times when my serious photography mood kicks in.I needed a digital camera for everyday photography and my criteria was:1. Ease of use / handling2. Compact (Not really really small - I have cell phone for that)3. Point and shoot features, i.e. good results with minimum fuss4. 5 MP minimum5. Decent zoom6. Within $ 300I did a fair amount of research spread over 3-4 magazines and 7-8 websites and I narrowed down to Canon Powershot and Nikon Coolpix as the two shortlisted brands (Sony is out because of it's proprietary cards).Narrowing it further, I decided on the Canon A700 and I believe it was a great decision. Not only does the camera more than satisfy all my criteria, it has phenomenal results.I am very very happy to say the least"
1,Beware the E18 error!!,I had the same experience as the other reviewer!The camera worked great for about 1 year and our family loved it!One day we turned it on only to find a black screen with E18 error. The camera never worked again!I thought someone had dropped it.We got ANOTHER Canon Powershot. SAME PROBLEM!!!I thought it was our fault until I Googled Canon and E18.STAY AWAY!!! It's not worth the frustration.
3,Not Canon's Best Effort,"I bought this camera for my trip to Italy as a backup to my Rebel XT and although I certainly didn't expect it to compete with my DSLR, I found the A700 to have a very cheap plastic feel to it. The photo quality was actually pretty good but like other's who have reviewed this camera, I also found the lag time between pictures to be a problem and for me the noise level starting at ISO 400 and above was not acceptable. I ended up returning this camera and getting Canon's new Powershot S3 IS which I can definitely recommend. I think most beginners would be more forgiving with the A700 but for the more discerning photographer, I would recommend looking at other models."
5,Point and Shoot Marvel,"The output of this inexpensive camera is great. Well exposed and sharp across the board. The ""Auto"" mode will satisfy almost any shooting condition you come across. The ""Program"" mode will add even more control for the unusual type of subject. With another 18 modes to use, if needed, almost anything you would want to record is possible. The only shortcoming I can find is the weak builtin flash, but this is a common shortcoming to almost every point and shoot digital camera. The real plus of this camera is the long zoom range. Coupled with a really good lens it makes this an outstanding camera in it's price range."
4,Broke after 2 months,"I ""loved"" this camera till it broke. I take VERY good care of all of my camera and the camera was never dropped or even a small scratch. But i bought this camera brand new in June and it broke just the other day. I sent it in for warranty and i will see what they say.It got stuck in Play mode and will not switch back to the camera mode.Seems minor, but i will just wait and see what they say.So i gave it a 4 out of 5. 5 of 5 for sure if it didn't break."
2,Canon A700-Ven,The product is good but the timing between every shot is very slow and sometimes disgusting. I own Cannon A75 and like A75 over this product
2,great zoom and nice features spoiled by slow flash,"The fellow who said the flash recycling on the A700 is ""horrible"" was correct. I bought this camera to replace a Canon S500 because it focused too slowly.The A700 focuses and shoots quickly- but only if you are NOT using the flash. If you use the flash you have to wait a very long time between shots- and that's with brand new batteries. It was unbelievably slow- slower than the camera I bought it to replace.I ended up returning the A700 and buying an A620. The A620 is slightly larger than the A700, has a smaller viewing screen, and has less zoom. Other than that it's a better camera. I don't mind the slightly larger size and smaller screen- the only thing I miss is the longer zoom. Even so- the A620 has a 4X zoom (equivalent of a 35-140mm lense on an slr)and that's not bad for a camera that will fit in your pocket"
1,cheap rubbish that'll blowout,"i had 2 of these, both fried under almost no load. sent one back, replacementcame & did the same thing. these are cheap garbage, stay away."
1,Negative reviews conveniently deleted,"Fourth time I have given this product a negative review. The previous 3 reviews were all deleted by Amazon. I'll try this last time.On my recent attempt to use the product I touched my vehicle and got a severe electric shock, in spite of the inverter being properly grounded. Next I grounded the vehicle also, but that caused fuses to blow. After struggling an hour, I was able to replace the fuses. On my third attempt, smoke belched out of the unit and it was no more.Whether or not this is typical behavior for the PMP1200, I can't tell. Use at your own risk."
5,The golden era of jazz-bossa nova,"This album is a classic of the jazz/bossa nova golden period. Same as Do the Bossa Nova, it was recorded in Rio de Janeiro with Brazilian artists. It included Joo Gilberto - who Miles Davis said ""would sound good reading a newspaper"" - the guitarist Baden Powell and Tom Jobim himself,author of several songs in the album and responsible for most of the wonderful arrangements, some piano playing and the vocal in One Note Samba. In two instrumental tracks Mann and Powell are alone in marvelous duets: listen how in Consolao the flute soars above the delicate phrasing of the guitar in a haunting effect!"
1,"Sounds good, looks good, but doesn't deliver","Dr. Lanctot starts off with a general overview of...exactly what? I'm not sure. Several times, she states that the power of healing is ""divine"" and is within ourselves. Thanks, but, no, if I break my arm, I'll go to an orthopedic surgeon. At one point in the book, she states that rabies is an illusion. ! When she does finally get to the pharmaceutical - health insurance power coalition, she starts to really explain the title of her book. However, she doesn't quite cover it in depth. The second half of the book is the best part, maybe the only part worth reading. Yes, she is right when she states that doctors practice defensive medicine. Much of her book I agree with, and much I don't agree with. Skip the first few chapters. When she writes about organizations and industries in the real world, pay attention; when she writes about spirituality and the god within us, ignore those parts."
1,Crackpot allert,"Yet another conspiracy for the masses, just incase UFO's, aliens, the ""secret government"", the illuminati, etc, were not enough. This time it is doctors calling the shots, and deliberately preventing their patients from being cured of their diseases. Even if you can get past the authors obvious lack of knowledge of medicine and treatment methods, basic biology, and incomplete grasp on reality, the book itself is still pretty bad. Self-contradictory and poorly written. Don't waste your money; in fact you can have my copy for free."
3,Just Self Praise,"After reading first 4 chapters, all I can say is that it was just self praise. Especially, his relationship with General Ali Quli Khan. That's what you find in all auto biographies, mostly self praise."
4,In the line of fire,"There is no end for a greed, people in politics have no limits or morales to achieve thier end goals without any remorse, this is what he tried to prove in this book under the current presidency of his tenure, a bold and a blunt attempt to expose the evil roots of the power, this is all about the power and greed for both the world with no respect of the human suffering. Unfortunately, the west cannot see the evil roots of a problem, or deliberately they avoid it, you cannot rule the world with the power but you can rule the world with justist, wars are not the solutions of the problems, no matter how long you can prolong it. Focus on solutions of the problems and provide justist to everyone. The same world will look different and the same people who look poison today will look sweet tomorrow. Divide and rule is obsolete in today's world. Live and Let Live others with peace. This is what he exposed in this book, to cut the problems from the bottom."
1,Get what you expect,This book is fine example of what you expect of a military dictator who himself grab power using force and denied the right to choose a leader for his people.He got all praise for himself and blame on others. He portrayed himself an ideal man and perfect ruler.Is not funny ??????
2,"I have not read the book, honestly...but...","Iam reading the reviews and the comments on the reviews(both by Indians and Pakistanis)...its hilarious.Iam thinking of writing a book ""Outside the Line of Fire"" , which is basically a compilation of all the reviews and the comments on those reviews.Anyone interested in publishing?Anyway cool down guys, remember, Manmohan Singh and Musharraf themselves are getting along well.So why are you guys fighting :)"
1,Best Work of Fiction of the Year,"This has got to be one of the best works of fiction of the year, if not of all time!"
1,A Narcissistic view from a dangerous dictator,"This book proves that this world is in grave danger from dictators who love themselves and believe that they are the center of the world's attraction. The more pages you read, the more you will realize that this man is delusional and in a position of power that makes this world a more dangerous place to live in. It is a pity that innocent citizens of Pakistan are being misled by this Narcissist who clearly lives in his own world of dreams that are far away from reality."
5,Excellent pragmatic book,The book details the pragmatic choices that Pakistan made when dealing with the post 9-11 era. It shows what happened behind the scenes.It also presents a very rational even handed view of the reasons for the rise of the Taliban in Afganistan and Pakistan's initial support and later renunciation of the Taliban. It deals with the US position in a very fair objective way.A book to be recommended to anyone trying to learn about the politics of South Asia
2,In the Line of Fire,"It's going beyond the facts and truth. Well!!, if it's concerned only for the people of Pakistan it's ok"
3,A General's Defense,"President Musharraf's memoir ""In The Line of Fire"" provides insight into the mind of a leader who is at the helm of one of Asia's most important developing countries: Pakistan. The book provides the reader a sense of Musharraf the man as well as Musharraf the politician. It details Musharraf's perspective regarding many important and controversial issues including the bloodless coup of 1999, the Kashmir issue, 9/11, nuclear deterrence, the ""War on Terror"", as well as international and domestic politics. Reasonable minds may differ on whether Musharraf's conclusions and actions are accurate or in the best interest of the nation, but there is no doubt that this is one of the most important political books to come out of Pakistan since Ayub Khan's 1965 book, ""Friends Not Masters""."
2,Disappointing,"I learned a bit about Pakistan's history, but spent most of the time listening to this man stroking his ego- he devotes every other page to this. Modesty is one thing this fellow is lacking."
4,IN THE LINE OF FIRE,Excellent review of his early life with an insight in what has influenced him and what his priorities are. A very refreshing view by someone in authority into the importance of good relationship with Turkey.
5,HONEST EFFORT,Detail and very revealing information. A sincere effort. His encounters with terroist shows his true fighting spirits.
3,Right man at the right time for Pakistan,"Although self-congratulatory at times, I found this memoir to be an astounding look at a career of someone whom I have always greatly admired. I thought it was amazing he took the time and effort to write this and communicate to the world his challenges and achievements. Musharraf has successfully walked that very fine line between the secular modernity and Islamic extremism of his constiuents, dragging his country forward into the 21st century. Musharraf is the right man at the right time for his country. Let's all hope, for the sake of Pakistan, and the sake of the world, that he's successful in modernizing and moderating his population."
5,A Brave Step,"I seriously believe that the book require a lots of guts to be published. Once you start reading it, you would not want to stop. It takes you to the twists and turns and the real life situations. I salute the efforts of Mr. President and wish him all the best to improve the image of Pakistan in this era.A must Read !!!"
1,Spider In the web of woven lies,"This book is a fiction based on imagination of Autocratic Artillery Gunner whose selfish motives made him topple democratic government of a nation to escape court martial for his mis-adventure in Kargil. It is not a memoir in any sense. It is full of lies but at times some partial facts are inter woven to morph the fiction into memoir. I would not recommend buying this book unless one is looking for a fiction. Being an Human, I cannot see a pampered dictator admired by the whole world. He is the nemisis of his own nation and others in Asia. Terrorism Begins with his dark horse ISI and ends with his dark horse ISI. Indians and Afghans know his real intentions when whole world is blind."
3,Interesting read but lacks in factual accounts,"I just finished reading this book. There are some startling relevations on wars with india, pakistan's war on terrorism and its cooperation with US. But, the author is unable to support his assertions with facts.Also, he is perhaps the only president to write his memoirs in office and will intend to run for office again. So, the credibility of his views on some contentious issues is questionable, since this book can have a direct impact on his future re-election in his country.I would give it 3.5 out of 5."
2,A must read.,"Just finished reading the book.I think its a desperate attempt in salvaging a little pride for the general and his country.Although i wont rate the book very high, i will still love to see it being read by as many people in america as possible.If the price for making more people aware about how this country works (and doesn't work) and how much trouble it can be for the rest of the world, is Musharraf making some money out of this book then its all worth it.The truth can't always be hidden anyway."
1,Will you read this book?,"I just saw Musharraf's interview with Wolf Blitzer of CNN.On being asked the question if Musharraf was serious about his comment in the book that the CIA paid a huge sum of money to the 'Government' of Pakistan on many occasions.........Musharraf said....""Oh, does it say that?....I don't know, err....(smile)...I don't think I wrote that and I don't know how it got in there""What's the use of the book, if he is not going to stand by his own written words!On another note, somewhere in the book, he mentions how Kargil was a landmark victory for the Pakis.What a sham!....If Pakistan always claimed that none of the Pakistani army was ever involved with Kargil...How could this be a landmark victory for Pakistan??"
1,"""Musharaff is coward""","Musharaff is a coward. He is proving it time and again. This time the Richard Armitage's statement forced pakistan to cooperate with US. He is on peace talks with india after trying out his best in ""Kargil"". He knows only one thing: ""negotiate to powerful"". He is bowing to both Bush and Manmohan singh."
3,Fighting Terrorism: A Challenge for All,"Even though I am originally from India, I admire the craftsmanship with which President Musharraf has steered Pakistan since 9/11.I find the book absorbing and well written. It is a good read for anyone following the global war on terror.Terrorism is caused by injustice, povery and ignorance. Presient Musharraf will earn immense respect if he donates all the proceeds from the book to fighting these menaces in Pakistan. I would challenge other countries to ""more than match"" this donation, but only in materials and goods. For India this would be a good CBM (confidence building measure), and a good first step in the recently initiated joint Indo-Pak effort to combat terrorism.A concerned citizen of this fragile planet Earth."
4,Modern look,"Like this better then the bulky top that orginally came with hod. This reduces water evaporation and is nice to view fish from above. Only complaint is that wish it could be held open hands free, also I did recieve first one cracked glass but I did get a replacement asap not broken 2nd time around."
2,Just what I was afraid of from a live album,"I had heard this guy on the radio and thought he sounded pretty interesting. Against my better judgement, I bought the live album based on the many positive reviews... I should have stuck to my instincts. It has everything I hate about live albums - screaming fans, extended boring solos, gratuitous self-indulgence, etc. I am sure this all seems cool in concert but it sounds juvenile in my living room."
1,Death,This album sounds like some one strung up a bunch of live animals on a clothes hanger and beat them one by one with a tire iron. Do I make MYSELF clear?
1,Wow,Martin is from Boston and his home town seems to hate him. I think that should tell the rest of you not to buy this awful awful album.
5,Don't believe the nay-sayers,"Someone seems to have a grudge against Martin Sexton here, but grudges aside, this is one amazing album. Martin Sexton is one of the most underrated, overlooked artists of our generation. His voice, booming one moment, lilting falsetto the next is more true and beautiful than any in music. His guitar skills are simply astounding-- his ability to comp and solo without breaking rhythm is womderful. When one considers that the man typically tours only with a drummer (no bass player, no keys), it magnifies his accomplishments. From bold and raucous to sad and slow, you will NOT be dissatisfied with this album. Buy it, love it, and thank your lucky stars you made the acquaintance of this fine, fine artist when you did.Without qualification, highly recommended."
4,It Only Gets Better!,"This is the second albumn I have bought of Marty Sexton's; the first being Black Sheep. Each time I listen to his music, I find a new range, pitch or harmony that has been lost by many of the ""Pop"" artists mass produced within the music industry.Live Wide Open is a great and more importantly; original albumn that combines his funky style with R&B; and a whole lot of Marty (no other words can really describe his style). I enjoy it as much as Black Sheep and hope he will be traveling to Houston soon!"
4,wide open soul,"a supreme talent who really gives it his all. He's such an ordinary looking guy who delivers such an extraordinarily joyous and immensely talented show.A wondrous display of ""vocal soul"" that runs circles around so many others in this genre."
2,Biggest Disappointment of the Year,"I have to disagree with the previous reviews of this new 2-disc set from one of the great singer/songwriters of our time. Having seen Martin be consistently astonishing in one live show after another, I was really looking forward to the new live CD. The reality turned out to be a real disappointment -- totally missing Martin's intensity, his wild-man stage energy, and not really doing justice to his awe-inspiring voice. I found the whole set rather flat and dull, and it most definitely feels padded -- the second double CD of the year (after Michelle Shocked's latest) that should have been a single disc. Martin is fantastic, but if you want a glimpse of his true genius and you can't catch a live show, check out BLACK SHEEP or WONDER BAR instead of this pale substitute. What a disappointment!"
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"Martin's allotment of talent approaches genius, so whataccounts for this album?2CDs=only 15 songs??? When I saw only 6 songs listed on the 2nd CD, I thought I'd read something wrong.If he's going through the trouble of putting out this album by himself, why not be a bit more generous in the amount, and the scope, of material.I had been looking forward to this album.I wish he'd unplug, send the band home, and let his geniusshinE on through."
4,Great showcase for an obscure talent,"One man band, Martin Sexton, is a huge talent.His biggest asset is his multi-octave voice. He can sing in a conversational style, take it up a notch/octave and show off his pipes or take it to the next level and really demonstrate his ethereal and heavenly voice.You listen to these songs and they take all sorts of unexpected, oral turns when his voice takes off (and it really, really takes off!). He's also a talented guitar player as well.Highlights include the funky ""Beast in Me"", the wonderful re-working of ""ice cream man"" and the perfect launching pad for his voice, ""In the journey"".Martin Sexton needs to be experienced in a live format to truly appreciate his talent. By the way, his songs are all very spiritual."
2,Way too small,The picture and description on the web site really do a disservice to the actual bag. We ordered it hoping to use it as a bookbag for our high school son but it was far too small.
5,Great Shirts,"These shirts were exactly what my husband wanted. Soft material, well made and had button down collars which are preferred for motorcycling. They were as described and were sent timely."
2,STUFFED IN AN ENVELOPE!,"The items purchased were just as I had hoped - except for the way they were packed. Or maybe ""not packed"" would be a better explanation. These 2 shirts were stuffed in an oversized envelope without ANY packing. Talk about wrinkled!!!"
2,Sizing ALL off!,"Don't know when ""large size"" became ""small to medium"" in different parts of shirts! This shirt had not even 3/4 sleeves on a medium body...not only too short of sleeves but no room for elbow bending either. Very poorly sized shirt overall."
5,Blown away! Acts 2:2,"If you are looking for a book to fan the flames of your church, study group, Sunday school class, or just for personal devotion, this is it! It is by far the best I have read in many years. It has challenged me to examine my motives and see where my walk really is and where it needs to go.It also has done the same for my church. This year we almost tripled our giving to foreign missions and for the first time budgeted for over seas short-term mission trips in addition to giving scholarships for them. We also started a outreach program and are contacting almost 200 people a month. This is something we have never done and we are only half way through the book.It has changed the way I do Christianity, the way we do church and it will do the same for you. Incredible! Acts 1:8In Christ's Love.Pastor Shawn Dobbs."
2,Ok...,"This book was ok. I think I was expecting more challenging suggestions on how to head toward a more kingdom orientedway of living. There were a few gems within the book, but, overall, not exactly what I expected."
4,Better than i thought,"i heard these guys and their song ""scavenger"" on the need for speed underground 2 soundtrack, and i thought it was very different from what i usually listen to, i.e. tbs, the used, saosin, and other emo basically. i got their cd and wow. the lyrics are so much better than i could have hoped for. i like ""pull out"" the most. the best message is ""penis envy"", but thats prob cuz i'm not american."
5,Fierce and beautiful,"This book knocked me flat. In a good way. The writing is exquisite. Alice Anderson's honesty will take your breath away. She has the courage to tell her heart's deepest, darkest truths while never compromising on the poet's craft. Anderson's poems are rigorous and right. They could be about trees and you'd swoon. But they aren't about trees. They are about a woman and her body and her life and the little girl who lives inside of her still. They are fiercely about one person and also about us all. I opened this book and didn't close it until I read every last poem, straight through. Human Nature is an amazing book."
4,"Good in most ways, picture quality not the best","I would love to keep this player since it's really small, looks nice, and works well in just about every way. However, as one person has already written, the picture quality is not the best. I have seen better in this price range. I tried adjusting all the video settings, but I could never get it to look as good as I feel it should. Maybe my expectations are too high for a $150 player, but the Panasonic DMR-ES25 recorder produced noticeably better picture quality for about the same price (and it's a recorder!)."
4,Great DVD player in many aspects.,It's a nice looking player with excellent construction and great picture as well as sound quality. It has many useful features and very easy menu. The only cons are that it lacks of RI connection to be used with other remote controls and does not have SACD support. If you care about them go for the DVSP504 model. Overall it's a product really worth to have it.
4,"Individuality, Ingenuity, Forgiveness... Stanley Has It All!","This is the first book I ever remember reading and it's cute messages have stuck with me all these years. Stanley wasn't like the other cavemen, he liked flowers, didn't like sleeping in cold damp caves and so he did something about it! It's a sweet little story about the merits of being your own person and following through with your ideas and forgiving those people who take a while to come around."
5,Stanley,I bought this book for my grandson. He went to see dinosaur Sue at the Science Center in St. Louis with his classroom at school. He is beginning to read & loves books.
3,It's ok.,I like Syd Hoff but I can't say I loved this book... it seemed a bit long and my son lost interest by the middle. I ended up having to read the book to him to finish up.
3,Acceptable Top 40 Fodder,"Vocally, Nami is acceptable but nothing special; She also doesn't really seem to dance, so apparently She's marketed mostly for Her looks, which is fine. This single comes with ""IAM"" (not spaced as it is listed on Amazon), ""Balance"" and karoke versions of both. Also comes with a sexy but conventional video. As Top 40 dance/light rock numbers go, this is okay stuff, but you have to be committed to pay Japanese prices for these discs. Basically, it's worth it if you look at that cover and think, ""HOT."""
1,"Been there, done this","Johnny Carson was awesome...but he was on TV for decades. So why does this company continue to rehash the same stuff, only with different packaging? The Carson Tonight Show years were vast and they could be releasing so much MORE content, but instead it's the same clips over and over again. I bought the ""Ultimate Collection"" originally and LOVED it. Then, they changed the box cover which seemed to be misleading to fans as though it was something different. Now, this mega-box includes the ""Ultimate Collectin"" AGAIN! If you are a Johnny fan like me, then you may have purchased the DVDs that were only available through the Carson Club on his website. Well, be warned...all of those titles that were supposedly exclusive to the Carson Club are also in this box! My guess is the die-hard Carson fans have every bit of this material already. Check what you have and know what this is beofre you spend a dime!"
1,Warning,"Hold your wallets until more is known.The description says that the The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection is included. If that is so, then you may not want this set either. The Ultimate Collection is cropped---especially the last show---the entire music segment is deleted.I fully understand why something like this can happen. The music publishers believe their product is gold and ask ridiculous licensing fees to have their music in these box sets. Regardless, no warning is given to the consumer from the DVD makers, so that is the reason for this early review. Remember, once you break the seal, your money is gone."
4,"Johnny, Plus TV Shows of the 50s","There's a lot from his Tonight Show, which most people expect, but included are other shows he did before that. There are also shows from the 50s that Johnny is not even in. Entertaining, and interesting to see how our tastes in entertainment have changed. These old shows are not colorized so if you have a problem with black and white you won't enjoy that portion of the set."
2,johnny carson collection big disappointment,"I bought this ultimate collection thinking i would see a lot of great interviews with the old stars instead i got a lot of bad monologue, repeat sketches , way too many animal spots most of which weren't funny at all. the only good thing about this collection out of all the dvd's were about half dozen interviews and they were very short at that and the one entire show that was only aired once before with unplanned guest like dean martin . i love the tonight show but there were so many shows that should have been included like the time dom deluise and burt reynolds were stuffing pies in each others clothes or interviews with chartlon heston john wayne, but nope instead they got just a mention and a brief picture in part of the dvd that was called those that have come by over the years or something like that , not talking just showing there faces. big waste of money i am going to resell it just as fast as i can."
4,Christmas Gift,This is a Christmas gift for my brother so I am hoping it will have a lot of great shows and/or great moments on them. Johnny Carson was the best in late night television and a family favorite!
5,Thank you for making my Brother's Birthday a HAPPY Birthday!,"This was a very easy and professional experience! The DVD's are in GREAT condition and the content, well it is ""Johnny Carson""! Needless to say my brother had a Happy Birthday and he loved his gift. Thank you!"
5,None Better than Carson,"No one will ever come close to Johnny Carson in their timing, their humor, their respect for their guests and their audience. Johnny was one of a kind. This is a great collection of why there will never be a late night show like The Tonight Show with the King of Comedy....Johnny Carson. Don't miss out on this collection."
5,"EVEN IF YOU DON'T LOVE JOHNNY, YOU WILL LOVE THIS","This is one of the best things I have ever purchased on Amazon. I kept seeing ads on TV for this boxed set and the price was double what Amazon was asking. Johnny Carson was NOT my favorite TV personality BUT to be able to see the starlets and male stars ( what do you call a male starlet? ) who later became superstars, to see Roseanne's FIRST TV appearance, to see all the sketches. Well...this is a TREASURE you just HAVE to have! TRUST ME ( And Like I said...I did NOT love Johnny BUT I Love THIS SET!!!!! ) Dennis R. Troy"
1,Same stuff over and over,"I guess there must be some reason they do not or cannot release more of Johnny Carson's shows. I think most of us fans would love to watch any show, even the worst of the worst, over again. But... I don't think we want to see a very small sample over and over and over again. There must be some reason they continue to repackage and not give us anything new. Does anyone know what legal or licensing problem might be responsible for this? I suppose I will die before they finally release some significant amount of material. How ironic that when this stuff is all available, many of the people who would appreciate it will have bitten the dust. What a travesty!"
5,Johnny Carson,this is a wonderful set....all of Johnny Carson's great hits...hours of entertainment and all my family and friends loved it...thankssue
2,Good for Beginners,"An interesting try for a basic opening system for White.Soltis recommends playing the Colle versus most replies.He suggests the Stonewall Attack against ...e6 systems and the Torre Attack against Indian Systems, like the Gruenfeld and Kings Indian. So far so good. Several authors have trotted out the Colle in this role. I have a few things I don't like about this book, however.The material is loosely presented and I found at least one move order problem. Soltis recommends 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 heading for either the Colle or Stonewall Attack. He recommends 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf6 g6 3.Bg5 the Torre Attack. But what if, in the first variation, Black plays 3...g6(!)? As one of the previous reviewers stated the bishop can't get to g5. Now what?? In addition, to get the Colle and Stonewall Attack to fit, he uses the older Kolty Colle with the pawn to c3 not the superior (my opinion) Colle system with the Qbishop developed at b2.Not worth the price in my opinion, much better books out there..."
5,Kick Ass CD,Kick ass CD with wicked hooks and an excellent soundDifferent than all of the music that's out there right now!I love it!
5,Out of Your Mouth,"this cd is wicked awesome!! they're not a very known band, but they're one of the greatest!!"
1,Missing Scene,"With great excitement I sat down to view this DVD, one of my all-time favorite documentaries. I was extremely disappointed to find, that in my favorite segment: The Liberation of France, the final scene had been cut! It was the best scene in the whole series. The beautiful footage of two flights of Thunderbolts, criss-crossing above the Arch de Triomphe was missing! These documentaries are works of art. You can't cut the last scene of one anymore than you could with Gone With The Wind. What were these guys thinking? I'm returning my set. I refuse to support such insensitive and indiscriminate editing and I urge others to do the same."
1,Heavily Edited - Wish I'd known,"Those individuals who have seen this series on television will likely be disappointed. The episodes have been very heavily edited and some of the more memorable scenes have been slashed away completely. Additionally, the titles of a number of the episodes have been changed. It would have been nice to have known prior to ordering that the product is not a DVD release of even a portion of the complete episodes of the television series, but rather a set of very heavily edited episodes with a dubious (though unknown) set of editing criteria. On the bright side, however, the transfer of the episode fragments to DVD technology was done quite well and the picture quality was better than I had expected it could be."
1,Series butchered,"The other reviewers are, unfortunately, correct - some of the most dramatic parts are cut or misplaced. For me, in particular, is the final portion of the Ploesti segment. If my fading memory serves me, the original ended with an ominous comment by Cronkite that now (rather than using and losing so many crew, planes and bombs) ""one plane , one pilot and one bomb"" would do the job and eliminate the target. And, having been an engine mechanic on those huge 28 cylinder, R-4360 radial engines (during the 60's) I also miss the engine start that began each episode."
2,Air Power - Missing half!,"When this program aired originally in 1956-1957, there were twenty six episodes, each 28 minutes in length. That is 11 hours of show.The series has been ""edited"" to 6 hours on this DVD set. This ""editing"" also lacks finesse. Is some AIR POWER better than none? I leave that decision to you, the potential buyer. Simply consider yourself warned."
4,Air Power with narration by Walter Cronkite,"I have been a major collector of WW 2 films. In fact, I had my own home movie theatre where I showed 16mm films in a 15 seat setting. I owned original prints of Victory at Sea, Battle Line, Biography (with a young Mike Wallace narrating), World at War and others. However, I found it very difficult to find one of my favorite series aired in 1956, AIR POWER. What I remembered the most was the beautiful opening and the music by the CBS Orchestra. I love seeing the complete film of any series, including opening and closings and the related credits. Unfortunately, the edited films available now (either on tape or DVD) have rearranged the original series and only at the beginning of each tape or DVD does it show the opening shots of the planes and the original theme music. That is what I miss, but otherwise, it was one of the finest docs ever produced on the WW2 planes and their effect on the outcome of the war."
5,WW II Addicts,I remember watching the original series on television in the late 50s. Very informative and so many of the particiapants were still alive to lend credibility to the shows.
3,some disappointment,I remember the shows being better than the ones on this DVD. The lack of the introduction music puts it into a category below Victory at Sea. The shows have been edited which also lessens the value of the shows. I would still recommend it.
4,Filled with emotion,"Ana has made an album with so much feeling in every one of the songs. Huelo a Soledad is simply chilling, her best yet. Be sure not to miss the a capella version!"
2,"Great story, listless models","Graphic novels, like comics, have to stand on the three legs of story, writing, and art. If any leg fails, the book fails. I found the story to be great and the writing to be above average. I found the photography to be lacking, though. It is not for a lack of technique, as one look at the cover image demonstrates (it is actually what drew me to the book--stunning). What bothered me about many of the pictures is the posing of the models. The models come off, well, posed. So much so that they look like mannequins when they should be expressing movement or emotion. Whether this is the fault of the models or the photographer I can't say but the responsibility ultimately lies with the photographer. It detracts from the work as a whole and keeps the book from being completely satisfying."
5,"""The Very Best of Oleta"" Adams Review Of This CD","This CD is beautiful and rich in musical artistry.Oleta has a lovely vocal range, and sincere emotion to each of her songs. Especially soothing is the well known song ""Get Here"". If you want something with an easy variety to listen to while driving or waiting in traffic, this CD is for you. I live in Houston,so as far as traffic goes,I know what I am talking about. I don't like vocalist's whose music you have to adjust the volume from one song to another. You will love this CD. Thank you Oleta for the making of this CD. It truly is your best,and you shine!"
5,Worth a subscription. Groundbreaking,Exceptional production values enhance this well illustrated and innovatively designed book-magazine (produced in a French and Spanish edition too) that includes critical and theoretical essays on design and architectural topics. Planned to issue three issues annually. Recommended.
4,Great book with poor recipes,"Wonderful, informative book. A classic that was referred by another mother. The only drawback are the recipes which are based on English cuisine."
2,Formatting on Kindle - Not Good,I found this book too difficult to use on the kindle. The formatting was weird and you cannot jump from chapter to chapter - can only go page by page which it useless with a book of this nature.
3,wrong book,i have bought from this seller before and had no problem so i didnt think i would have one this time but i had originally ordered the contented little book of weaning but recieved the contented little baby book. i was very annoyed as i had waited for weeks for it to arrive and i was in need of some help and advise on weaning my son. i have kept the book as it has some useful information and i could not wait for the book i actually wanted to be sent.
3,Sadly nothing to great,This is most definately not Richard Matheson's best work. It's an OK read but it wasn't quite what I would expect from him. It simply seemed to be lacking the depth of a typical Matheson novel. If you're like me you're going to buy it anyways because you love Richard Matheson's work; but don't be surprised when you place it on the shelf never to read again.
3,not up to par,"earthbound is a okay book, but it is not up to par with his other novels. in fact, you would be better off to think of it as a novella. the character development (or lack thereof) is very poor and the characters are pretty one sided. It takes an interesting concept, but even Matheson's immense skill for writing couldn't save this one. If you are new to his work, try Hell House or I am Legend instead. This one is definitely for the die hard fans of his writing and it just didnt work for me..."
2,Kind of dissapointing,"I am a Richard Matheson fan I like his stories, but I was not to impressed with this one. For one it just was not scary to me. I mean if a good looking girl ghost all a sudden appeared and she wanted to have sex with me well I just don't see that as a horrifying experiance. I would recommend it only if you are a die-hard Matheson fan."
3,Minor Matheson,"A fairly rambling ghost story that is ultimately not on par with Matheson's classic Hell House, but is okay if you don't expect much. Too much introspection on the part of the ""hero"" and not enough stuff really happens. Might be a little too graphic sexually for some people looking for an old fashioned haunted house tale."
4,So far so good,"I have had no issues with the printer so far. The scan software works great and it does have a preview function and one can control the resolution. Perhaps some of the previous users had an older version of the software. I have version ""D"". One can download the latest versions from brother.comThe printer and copier work great too. I primarily do basic text with light graphic printing and for my applications, it seems to be good enough. If I want to do photography, it is cheaper to do it at a professional photography center.The build of the printer is pretty cheap and flimsy. I would be happy if it survives for more than two years. However its compact form factor is great. It does not have the bulky auto feeders, which is not a concern for a light home user such as me.The issues of heavy ink usage are a concern. I will cross that bridge when I come to it and give my revised ratings then."
2,Oh Brother!,"Okay, I'll admit it. I bought this with the idea that it had a lot of functions at a great price. Unfortunately, other than looking kind of cute and being a decent copier/printer (not great, just decent), this machine is a dud! It is nearly impossible to read the panel display unless either you or the MFC-210C are situated at an unusual angle (and I am NOT exaggerating), the fax machine AND the scanner are ridiculously complicated to use and instead of having an easily accessible owner's manual, you're stuck with the cheaper to distribute CD. And when you do access the owner's manual/user's guide it's so darn complicated and hard to understand that you'll wish you'd bought a book on pathology instead. Sure, if you take the time you can figure it all out, but let's face it, in today's fast-paced world, why should you have to?In short, you get what you pay for and frankly, I didn't get much."
3,Envelope feeder,"One feature I wish this product included is a separate envelope feeder slot or tray. As it is, one must remove the entire paper tray, remove all of the paper, position the envelope in the tray and re-insert it. Once the envelope prints, one then must remove the paper tray, re-load the paper and re-insert the paper tray. Had I realized it lacked this feature I would not have chosen this all-in-one.Otherwise, so far I am happy with this product."
4,Surprisingly nice,"I read all the reviews, then decided I couldn't beat the price. After 4 hours installing it,(including 1 1/2 hours on hold/speaking with tech support) it finally became operational. My problem was I had an old paperport program from my previous Brother printer that needed uninstalling. Since then it has been surprisingly nice. It does everything I ask it to do. It is quiet, compact, and has great print. Tonight I printed a photo and it was great. A hint about faxing - use super fine. So far (1 week out)it has been wonderful."
2,"Nice size, but...","This is an okay printer. It does what it says, i.e. prints, copies, scans and faxes, but I found printing envelopes to be a nightmare! They always get stuck, smudged inside of the machine or print crooked. The print quality is okay, but not half as crisp as other ink jets I have owned. I have owned this machine for 6 months and am currently looking at other manufacturers to purchase a new one."
1,Bad for large jobs,"Same problems as Fred's review, I have about 100 sheets of wasted paper. Printer is going back today, gettting an epson."
5,! What a deal !,"For christmas 2004 I bought my first Brother MFC-210C, to replace the old Hp 710 printer and my Acer Vista scanner. We, me and my 2 daughters (18 an 21) and my youngest son (13) have been using it at home for more than 7 months. We all, are extremely happy with the Brother quality of prints, low noise and speed, that I am planning to buy a second one for my self so I leave the other to the kids. In adition to its really economical functioning, I recharge the ink cartridges (perfect kits and instructions from ""The Printer Ink Warehouse""), having so more savings and better continuity of operation. It is beautifull and strong, a great deal. 100% recomended to any one."
1,Don't buy this printer,"Don't buy this printer unless you want to spend all your money buying ink. When one of the four inks run out, it won't do anything. I hardly ever use colored, but it keeps running. I am giving mine away to the Goodwill and write the price off my taxes."
4,Good and compact,"Your satisfaction depends on what you want. Print quality is not the best, so don't plan on using this for photos, etc. According to Consumer Reports, this is on the higher end for cost per page, that is, the $ for cartridges. On the plus side, this is small. I like my desk space, and both the output and input printer trays are contained inside the printer. I've had zero problems with the scanner, and the 5-in-1 card reader is great. A LOT in a compact package. I just bought a Canon PIXMA MP160 and am disappointed at how much space it takes up, and no fax or card reader."
1,"Worked fine, not anymore","I got this for about 80 dollars and it worked well for a couple years but now it can't even read that there is a cartridge in it. I have used all Brother cartridges and I still have problems with it. I hate that it has 3 separate color cartridges. Ink is expensive. I was happy with it but now I just want to throw it out the window but I believe in recycling. I think I'll just stick to the Partner Stores at rieseninternationdotcom. They have over 700 Partner Stores such as Circuit City, Office Depot, Shop, etc and they give incentives if you go through them. They also carry exclusive products as well."
1,Cheap machine but uses ink like crazy!,"I have had this machine for a few months and already replaced all the inks multiple times. Consider I've only used it a few times a month to copy, it's pretty expensive to keep the ink flowing! It refuses to print even black and white if one color ink runs low - ""low"" not even empty! I am looking into buying another multi-purpose machine that is chepaer to keep it working."
1,"How many ways can I say ""I hate it""?","I was happy to buy this macinne. I prefer separate inks, I wanted a scanner, I don't use the fax. Very soon I started having problems. The worst thing it does is suck the paper back and then declare ""Paper Jam"" which involves opening the back , and then I often have to do it more than once.Also it will only take thin paper, so if I want to do labels it gives me trouble. I also don't like the fact that if any ink runs out, it will not print, not even in Black.I am getting rid of this as soon as I can find one I like to repace it.I think I'll go back to Canon."
1,Ink Money Pit,"My biggest problem is that the machine says that the ink is empty when it is clearly visible that there is actually quite a bit of ink left. Also, when replacing one of the colors, the machine will ""clean"" until it then proceeds to tell you that all the colors need replacing. I hardly ever use the color, yet I actually end up replacing it more than I do the black ink because it is smaller and it seems to disapear on its own."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I have the Brother MCF 210 for aout 2 years now. Let me tell you...the way Brother designed this machine -it is an ink guzzler. Whats more, it spends far too much time cleaning and resetting. Today -it spontainiously diald"" out though I was trying to print , not fax.NOT user friendly IMO."
4,Brother flat bed all in one printer,"The printer is working fine so far. I previously had a brother all in one that was not a flat bed coppier. It would often jam the paper I was copying, if it was too thin. My othe one just quit and left a message ""cannot print"" I tried everything but could not get it fixed. This one seems to be doing great."
5,MFC-210 = EXCELLENT,"I am surprised at all the negative feedback. I don't have any problems with ink runing out and all these additional expenses. At Inkjet123.com I bought 10 cartiges for $28.07 (3black and 2 of each color), all brand new and work great.I have had this printer for over 1 and 1/2 years and have found it to be very reliable (printing,fax,pictures,etc.). This printer replaced a $276.00 Lexmark (junk). The price is right and the printer works like a charm.Very satisfied with the product."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MACHINE,"Just like many of the other reviewers said, this machine was designed to syphon ink (and money) even if you are not using it. It supposedly cleans itself every so often (using some of the ink to do so). Even though I never used the color ink, it kept beeping and indicating empty color ink cartridges and will not print even in black until you replace those cartridges.This is one of the worst machines that you can buy and I am sure that the company has heard many complaints about it, but they seem to have one thing on their mind and that is to rip you off by designing such an ink waster even when the machine is not in use.I gave it a one star rating only because the choices did not have a zero star which is definitely what it deserves."
2,Just an average inkjet printer,I just purchased one of this and realised that when it comes to photographs this printer does not live up to the job. You can see the white lines on the paper very clearly. I still prefer my HP ... For ordinery job .. this machone is okay ... but when comes to pictures ... it is a no no ....
1,Zero star. Good for Nothing,"NEVER EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT. I concur with all negative reviews. The ink simply evaporates away even when you don't use it. Cost of ownership is extremely high. You have to buy all the 4 cartridge for it to work, even if you need only black one.I have trashed this product as you can buy a new printer with the cost of 4 cartridge replacement for this stupid product.Brother company is simply giving this product for cheap to get continuous ink order, which is far more profitable for them.This machine will not take third party ink or refillable ink.stay away from it"
1,skip this printer (or brand even),"Extremely poor product. Finicky, expect lots of error messages, and annoying 3-beep error response to everything you're trying to do.I couldn't figure it out initially and left it there for a few months. When I came back to it, the ink was all empty before I even got it to print once. After replacing the ink cartridges and finally printing, and not using it for the next month or so, I get the dreaded 3-beeps. My yellow ink needs replacement even though I've only printed a few pages, never printed in color. Heck I don't even care about the color printing anymore, but it won't even allow me to print a text document (in black) without replacing the damn yellow cartridge."
2,Not a smart purchase.,"I use it time to time - mostly to scan documents or to send a fax.Ink aredryed beteen usage (or almost between) and the device does not work unless you changed ink (not to scan, not to send a fax)."
1,"Holy, moly",I cannot imagine that there is a worse printer on the market. This thing is terrible. I may print 20 sheets per month and 60% of the time there is an ink problem or paper jam. I am constantly having to buy color ink and have not printed in color in years. This thing isn't good for a boat anchor.
3,Good one. Value for money.,"The product did'nt work for 3 times and went through lot of repack and send with Brother which was a pain. Brother kept replacing the printer. Once I got a working one it is working on and on.Have been using this printer for 5 years now. Good one. Have printed so many copies in color, and black and white. Used it for faxing many pages and used it as a scanner too. One thing is paper jam is common. So I dont leave extra papers in the tray since I dont take regular printouts and keep the paper dry. Need to use a higher quality paper than normal. Also the printer auto cleans hence you are looking at frequent change in ink cartriges."
1,Poor quality,This printer does not last very long before breaking with light use at home and the print quality and speed are not good.
2,MFC 210C printer,I am having a problem getting the black to print legibly. I contacted Brother and followed their suggestions and I am still having this problem.
2,I thought it was a great deal..,"I bought this printer @ officemax for $53, checked 8-pack inks for $20 on ebay and I printed couple of maps and it worked really nicely. Until one day, I realized it couldnt handle powerpoint of large size (~100mb). I reduced the size into 4mb but it still couldnt handle this job. It is so important to me since I need color slides for my class. I am a bit disapointed despite of the price of it and it's inks."
4,It's pretty cool,Well I've only used this printer for one day and so far I've been pretty impressed. the copying was a little off but I'm really only using it for school papers and stuff and some occasional photo printing but nothing MAJOR. It's a great deal for a college student too pricewise. i'll never get another hp printer again!
1,Not worth the effort,This is the second 210C I have owned. This is the second 210C I have damaged beyond repair due to anger. These machines are very tempermental regarding the ink. The machine will state the ink is empty when there is ink in the cartridge. It also does not like off brank inks. I love the interface and functions of this machine and that is why I bought the 2nd one. There will not be a 3rd. Insult to injury - they denied my rebate submission. Go ahead and buy one of these and test your level of control.
1,design failure and awful support from brother,"this is the 3rd time in 6yrs im am looking at the mfc 210c printer,because i keep ink for this printer stocked up @ 44.00 per pack (overpriced)so i have 132.00 worthof new ink cartriges,what a waste now1)printer head failure after 4yrs (not worth fixing twice the repair cost then buying a new one2)hardware failure on 2nd printer after 1yr(unable to print see userguide)total support failure telling me i have to send it for repair which is twice the cost of the printer better to just throw in the garbage and buy a new onethis unit once in troubleshoot mode wont clear itself after unplugging AC cord as told by brother tech support"
1,I'm tossing this one out,"I've had this machine for a little over a year, and I'm really, really tired of buying ink for this hog when there's still ink left in the cartridge. I hardly ever print color, and the cartridges STILL manage to empty themselves regularly somehow. If one cartridge registers empty, you're simply out of luck - the printer won't function. I'm not even going to give it to someone, lest I be thought of unkindly when THEY discover that it requires regular feeding whether it's used or not (and the cartridges are definitely not cheap)..."
1,Do not buy,"This is a poorly designed and constructed device. It constantly locks up, paper jams, and otherwise just fails.Brother used to be a reputable company that made reliable products but after my experience with this item I would stay away from any of their products*** update after a yearI hardly ever print anything so I did not want to go out and buy another printer. I now hate this printer more than any other product I have ever purchased in my entire life.It drinks up ink cartriges even if you don't print anything, by going through periodical ""cleaning"" cycles. I fixed this by turning off the electrical outlet feeding the printer from my computer power conditioner unless I am using it.Now I just want to scan something, but it won't let me because it is out of Cyan. WTF do you need Cyan ink for if you are just scanning?!?!I just ordered an ink refill kit online, hopefully this will be a reasonably inexpensive way to feed the appetite for ink that this piece of junk has."
1,DO NOT BUY,Do not buy this printer. Do not buy this printer. Do not buy this printer. I've had to reinstall it every other week! It's too frustrating to even explain... you do not want to be this angry at an inanimate object. Just avoid it at all cost. I wouldn't even take it if it were free!
2,CHECK THE SONGS! WRONG ALBUM ART!,"PROCEED WITH CAUTION:I don't recommend the Elektra recording ""Dee Dee Bridgewater"" containing the songs: Lonely Disco Dancer, Gunshots in the Night, When You're in love, et al. I am big Bridgewater fan but this recording is crap. (I had the LP years ago).I do recommend the Atlantic recording ""Dee Dee Bridgewater"" containing the songs: It aint easy, Goin through the motions, You saved Me, et al. with the caveat: it is an R&B; album indicative of it's time."
5,Brilliant and Humorous Songwriter,"Hayes Carll is a great new talent! His songs are unique, entertaining and thought-provoking. Hayes' lyrics will take you through a gamet of emotions about the serious side of life that he tempers liberally with his incredible sense of humor. I first heard him at Wunsche Bros. Cafe where he opened for Jimmy LaFave. I added his CD to my collection as have many of my friends. He is one of my favorite singer-songwriters."
4,Great new sound!,A perfect combination of old school rock 'n roll and bluegrass with a country twist. Perfect Lover rocks while Arkansas Blues slows down the pace with simple acoustics and a lonely voice. It's a Shame offers a great duet.
2,Great beginnings,I bought this to fill out my cataloge of Hayes music. I saw him live with Robert Earl Keen and I was drawn to his humor-very reminicent of Todd Snider. I found it to be much better music than I was expecting. Very enjoyable on its own merits. Live Frre or Die is awesome!
2,"Keep the so so soul, gimme the bass!","He is THE monster bass guitarist of the times but you would never get that by listening to this recording. This sounds like a fun time with the family in the recording studio but Victor's brilliant playing takes a back seat to mediocrity on this one. Almost ANY one song played by VW with the Flecktones buries most of his efforts here. If someone told me that this was a Bootsy Collins disc I could believe it, but a Victor Wooten offering? Actually, the Yang side of his Yin-Yang disc tended to go in the Soul Circus direction which surprised me back then too."
2,"Great Bassist, regular record","The first time which I listened a Wooten's music... I felt a great sensation, then it wanted to buy some Wooten's records.. and I did it.In this record, Wooten disappoint me.. but it's just a record... he never it stopped being a great musician."
2,An era long past,"I am a fan of all bass musicans including Victor, but this outing is painfull to listen to. It sounds like bad 70' funk with bad 80' rap layered on top.The lyrics provided are cheesey at best, allthough they are written with a meaningfull philosophical content, they could be penned by an elementary student with a degree in ryme.The bass playing is a step down from Victors ability shown in the past and I hope for a return to his signature roots for the future of bass."
1,Don't buy this ever,"I love Wooten. He is incredible, but only when he actually plays the bass. This CD is him doing mediocre singing. Not really any bass. If you want him playing some bass get ""A Show of Hands"". If you want lame ""soul"" music then get this. I am extremely dissapointed, but that is what I get for not doing any research before I made the purchase."
5,An incredible music album,"This is an incredible album if you are looking for great music. This album displays Victor Wooten's musicianship at it's finest. Every song is well written and well played by all of the instrumentalists. If you are looking for flashy bass technique without much feeling, look elsewhere. However if you want well written songs where the flash comes from the overall musicianship, this is a great album."
1,What the H E double hockey sticks is this??,"I'll keep this brief and simply quote two sources.1) This disc is horrible for all the reasons that the previous reviewer points out.2) As the language censors would be dissatisfied I will modify my quote (from the movie ""This is Spinal Tap"") below to suit those who are easily offended:~ crap sandwichHaving witnessed Mssr. Wooten's instrumental prowess on stage nothing prepared me for the recycled misery that is Soul Circus. I have no idea what prompted him to:a) write these songsb) record these songsc) actually release these songs to the publicDont bother with this recording, see him live instead."
3,Looking for more,"I really enjoyed the album, but I expected more. I guess I was looking for more bass and less singing(except for ""Victa"", That was ""Off the Meat Rack"") I feel if there was going to be more singing, there should have been a double disc like the Yin Yang album."
1,Rambling and directionless,"I admire Gibson's work, but this book reflects too much intoxication and not enough theory or study of human life. The characters are transparent and the drama window dressing on a plot that never quite materializes. He hammers home a few concepts here and there, but really, nothing unifies this book except the cover. Skip it and go for one of Gibson's lucid and beautiful works like ""Neuromancer"" or ""Pattern Recognition."""
4,"Read the rest first, less graphic","Nice character work in this book, less technology (no colour descriptions!) but more data oriented. The plot is raher vague but basically its a chase for something with the usual Gibson pieces added bridges, bums and cops I think this book is about culture verses globalisation.Works well a more human book Good Gibson."
2,Only to complete your collection,"I was dissapointed by this book. The characters are bland (as we have come to expect from Gibson), but in his previous work, this was offset by a wealth of action and background information on the world. In All Tomorrow's Parties, the action is lackluster, and the only extra information about the world (which was fleshed out better in Virtual Light and Idoru, the previous books in the ""series"") are Gibson's insights in the colors of computer-cases, and his passion for old watches. In some passages, his prose is snappy as before, but overall, this book lacks any taste."
2,Gibson no longer has the cutting edge,"When William Gibson constructed Neuromancer in 1984, you might say he was at a nodal point of literary style. He envisioned the ""cyberpunk"" era towards which our world was evolving. When Gibson bravely sailed the boat of his imagination 20 to 40 years into the future (back in the 80s), he had a clear course of direction. The social and technological changes he foresaw seemed accurate. And yes he did predict a lot of the internet/matrix evolution.However, as the new millennium begins, he has not adjusted his compass. The same 1984 worldview of the ""around the corner"" cyberpunk future has been updated with many marvels of biotechnology, and Gibson just isn't on the pulse any more. William basically described next step internet technologies straight out of Wired magazine and then threw in the word ""nanotechnology"" as the next big thing.Unfortunately, Gibson can not see past the same nodal point he viewed in 1984."
5,"A new book, but with a walk down memory lane feel to it","The feel of All Tommorrow's Parties is less edgy than Virtual Light, but that's ok because The City(San Francisco) is less edgy in real life now than when Virtual Light was published. William Gibson has my thanks for returning his attention back to Chevette Washington and Berry Rydell(from Virtual Light), Colin Laney and Rei Toei (Idoru) and for his new characters: especially Silencio, Konrad and Boomzilla. The characters are familiar, the city and bridge are familliar, but the pushing hand behind the scenes is different...as if the real feel of San Francisco, which has mellowed and aged since Virtual Light, has affected the writing of Parties, that this novel is more societial criticism than near future dreaming.....either way, it works. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
2,Big disappointment,"Having liked both 'Idoru' and 'Virtual Light', I was excited to hear that ATP was going to include the characters from both of the previous books. However, the new book, while not terrible, is really devoid of anything exciting and the characters aren't developed any further than they already were. In particular, Laney's representation in the book is extremely one-dimensional and meaningless. The others aren't a lot better either.All in all, when I finished ATP, I couldn't shake the impression that this book was written to fulfill contractual obligations that Gibson had to the publisher. At least I'd like to hope so, because the alternative is that his originality is beginning to dry up."
4,Not Bad,"I actually really liked this one, and I'm surprised by a lot of the negative reviews below. I'm not a huge Gibson fan: I've only read Neuromancer and Idoru, but I did like both of those. A couple things caught my eye about this book when I first saw it. Gibson's style has this reputation for being ultra-cool, and the book was called All Tomorrow's Parties which is a (very good) song by the Velvet Underground, so Gibson himself get the image of being ultra-cool here (as well as of being in the know).The plot to this one struck me as actually stronger than that of Idoru, but the writing was not as electrifying as Neuromancer. It's certainly worth reading if you like Gibson's work. If you don't or if you're just not familiar with his work, well this doesn't change much about Gibson's reputation as an author. He's still the guy who wrote Neuromancer and a bunch of cool cyber-punk books afterwards."
4,Typical Gibson...which is a good thing,"All Tomorrow's Parties will not surprise many Gibson fans. It's not a radical departure from his normal style and it carries the same moral weight of his previous works. The third tale in the trilogy which began with Virtual Light and was continued in Idoru, this novel is laden with many familiar characters and plenty of action, gadgets and villans. Gibson proves once again to be a good story teller with an interesting insight into what makes people and societies tick."
3,Meandering,"The book is a fairly compelling page-turner, but when I finished it I didn't feel a sense of loss, I wasn't enlightened or inspired, etc. I was just like, ""Hmm. Okay. So what?""It was nice to see old characters which we had warmed to in previous books and see how they were doing, and getting them re-united at a nodal point of civilization.And of course the book's context of a civ's nodal point allows for no proof of its existence. But I guess it might be nice to deal with in a future book WRT time-travel."
1,Gibson must have owed someone a quick book...,"I read Virtual Light and loved it. I have read All Tomorrow's Parties and did not. This is a mismash of characters and strung together contrived plot devices that sound like he felt he needed to be ""clever"" and live up to his image. Gibson must have owed his publisher a book and here it is... You can skip this one and not miss a thing."
2,Not much of a story really and a little too weird,"I keep hoping for another book as good as ""Neuromancer"" but not finding it. I don't think Gibson has another like that one in him. I barely finished this one and in the end was disappointed concluding that I shouldn't have bothered."
3,Gibson's shattered holograms not what they used to be,"Not bad, but not Neuromancer. His abilty to depict a disjointed and hard-edged cultural distilation doesn't shine and reverberate like it did in the original books, but he's still a man alone in the genre he reiterated. I am irritated that he doesn't give credit to his musical inspirations: in Idoru he lifted one of Rez's quotes from Digital Heroes of Hyphoprisy and now he is leeching from Sisters of Mercy with his use of ""this... corrosion"" and ""vision thing."""
2,This book is pointless,"I'll give it two stars only because, as a reveiwer's quote from the cover says, he's a great ""stylist."" I used to be a huge Gibson fan, but this book left me completely cold. The story lines are pointless, characters poorly developed, and the conclusion is a big yawn.Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Wonderful story and amazing ideas,I have read all 3 of the books in this series and loved them all. I have reread them with great enjoyment getting more from them each time. I think he is possible the most literary of the speculative fiction writers and is really enjoyable to read. The stories are complex and the characters well drawn. I highly recommend all of them
3,"Unfortunately, very disappointed","I had so been looking forward to a new Gibson. But. This book feels perfunctory, at best. A duty performed; a commitment honored. It only starts to acquire blood & heat toward the end. But then again, there's a fire, so that might explain the heat. While the concept, the premise of the book is as good as ever, the writing itself feels disengaged. He is relying, it seems, on standard licks. His chops are his chops, but this time they seemed ""phoned in."" The only time the familiar, neo-noirish, immensely imaginative and GENUINELY superb skills of/unique voice of the author come through is in the later 3rd of the book. And any time he brings the idoru ""on stage."" I'm hoping that the door he left open with her -- the final image he gives of her -- becomes the beginning of the next book, and a subject he can be nihilistically/vitally passionate about. Again."
3,Drifting,"The preceding books in this trilogy, ""Virtual Light"" and ""Idoru"", were contemplative and human, in contrast to the rhythmic intensity of ""Neuromancer"". While the prose in Idoru was so descriptively dense that my eyes hurt, All Tomorrow's Parties felt like a limp attempt to complete an idea that didn't need anymore closure. Some elements in the book felt more contemporary than futuristic, such as the obvious parallels to Ebay, MTV's Real World, Cognitive Dissidents, software bloat, cloning, etc. There were also many elements that seemed, perhaps unintentionally or coincidentally, borrowed from Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash, i.e. badass killers with big knives, institutional strip malls, nanotechnology.Perhaps the future charted by Gibson's previous novels has already caught up to him and to us. Maybe that's why the book didn't seem quite as exciting. I'm going to have to read it again."
2,More than you ever wanted to know about wristwatches,"I desperately wanted to like William Gibson's All Tomorrow's Parties, but I just couldn't enjoy it even a little. Once upon a time, Gibson's tales of net-running were surreal glimpses into the fertile imagination of a master computer geek. With this book, we get a look into the imagination of a wristwatch fanatic.The book is loosely about the end of the world. Unfortunately, this world ends not with a bang but a fizzle of river water on burning bridges. At times, Gibson tries to add a bit of comic relief to lighten the tedium, but the jokes tend to flop like a half-dead trout.If you're looking for interesting technologically-based fiction, try something by Neal Stephenson."
1,Worst book of the late '90s,"William Gibson has proven himself to be a master of style over substance, but in this book he seems to have run out of even that. Majority of the characters are brought in from Idoru, poorly, he adds nothing that hasn't been seen in other cyberpunk books, even that he himself hasn't already written. There are less ideas in this whole book than in two pages of Stephenson's Diamond Age. The action, what little there is of it, is frazzled, has no rhyme let alone reason, and comes to no conclusion grand or otherwise.This the worst book I have read in many years. I can only hope that Gibson put out this piece of drivel as a conscious way to make a quick buck."
2,Dull Party,"I was disappointed in Tomorrow's Parties. Very little happened. Most of the characters, endearing as they are, are recycled from previous stories. Some new ones -- Silencio, Bomzilla, anonymous killer -- were excellent. Some of the actions seemed pointless: why was the bridge burned? Is Gibson as burned out as some of his characters? His futuristic hardware and software seems little beyond today's realities."
4,not the golden gate bridge,"I liked this book. And maybe this is a small point. But I read it while visiting San Francsisco for the first time. The bridge on the cover is, of course, the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge in the book is never named, but it's clearly the Bay Bridge. Maybe a small point, but ..."
3,Not his best effort,"Having read all of Gibson's previous books, I was prepared for another look at a not so distant and easily believable future. What I got instead was a collection of partially realized sketches and thinly fleshed out characters. Lots of atmosphere, the usual Gibson grittyness, but no real substance. Compressed and re-edited, this book would make a great first three chapters or so of a much better Gibson novel."
3,"Well, I wish I liked it more",I usually like William Gibsons' work but this I found lacking in a big way. Only one or two characters were interesting and I could easily figure out the end. It was not what I would call his best work by ANY means.
3,Not the best,I've come to expect no resolution. I've come to expect marginal endings. As long as there is some body to the story and some interesting characters. And that's what you get.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Bringing them together and shaking them all about.Or that is possibly what is going to happen according to the nodal point expert from a previous novel.Also appearing are the down and out cop, the bike messenger, and more as whatever nodal man seems to see might be coming, he reckons it is big.Throw in a Tao warrior for the hell of it, and no, this book doesn't necessarily make a whole heap of sense.2.5 out of 5"
2,Frustrating and dense--and not in the good way,"I found this book to be incredibly frustrating to read and ultimately unsatisfying. Gibson's writing style, hallmarked by inserting long paragraphs in the middle of a character's spoken dialogue, kept me from connecting to the characters. The plot, such as it is, is so thin and pointless that the book would be a pamphlet but for the long descriptions about the mundanity of Gibson's futuristic world.As a fan of science fiction, and particularly this genre of books, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
1,The One Gibson Book to Skip,"As a true Gibson fan I was disappointed. The author feels compelled to introduce most characters from previous (good) books, make them meet in San Francisco, where they then save the world without knowing that they just saved the world from a unknown and unexplained danger. To spice it up, the author throws in a lot of guns, several hit men, a multitude of near escapes for the old characters. There is also a super villain in the background, a kind of a Bill Gates guy - just as boring - who actually figures out that seeing and adapting to change produces wealth and power.I felt there was no story, no new cool ideas and what was truly annoying to me was the author's urge to explain what the characters did in previous books. Read Gibson's earlier books. This book was probably not even written by him, half the stuff is repeat from his older books."
2,Not This Time,"I'm sorry to slash this because I'm a big fan of Gibson; I gaveseveral copies of Idoru away as gifts (a five star effort). But thislacks all the ingredients we've come to expect. There is really very little action in the book--too many folks sitting around in rooms waiting for things to happen. The bad guys are plastic characters and are so easily removed they hardly matter. Worse yet is the bland cyberspace hunt where Laney does nothing and all doors simply open for him. No intrigue whatsoever. The story's intent is to build to a great dramatic change, but it never delivers. The ending is lethargic with yet another bad guy just walking off stage. There are a few nice moments, of course, but I was left really disappointed. I'm sorry, William, since I'm a fan and look forward to your next effort to take us deeper into human character and futuristic technology's involvement with our lives..."
2,staggeringly pointless,"William Gibson is one of my favorite visionary authors, I love his style and concepts----and every other book he's written! This book , however, never really gets off of the ground,and just dances around with itself in search of both plot tension and a satisfying conclusion. i was going to give it one star, but he has enough of his city descriptions to make it barely tolerable. Gibson really fails on this one-i wouldn't waste my time....pains me to say that. All of his other stories have an actual payoff, this one just goes round and round."
4,Unfinished symphony...,"""All Tomorrow's Parties"" boasts an intriguing cast, a mysterious plot, and well-written internal monologue. Gibson has intricately woven the characters' separate paths together, developing a multitude of relationships whilst holding the reader's interest quite successfully.That said, the book feels unfinished -- the ""end of the world"" scenario hinted at throughout the book never actually occurs, and the content of the final chapter is trivial at best. The reader is likely to feel cheated, as all the suspense has been for nothing.Enjoy, but don't expect a standard plot structure."
2,Boring,"I've read three other Gibson books - Neuromancer, Virtual Light and Mona Lisa Overdrive. Loved Neuromancer and the others were a good read but I simply lost interest in this book halfway through. I rarely never finish a book but I found myself forcing myself to read this book about a third of the way through. When I got halfway through it went down and never got picked up again.It's not that it's really bad - it's just not very exciting. Seemed to be like trolling through everyday lives but in a Cyberpunk setting. Maybe Gibson doesn't let enough secrets through early but basically I'm not interested in reading 200 pages of lead-in to get to the good bit at the end. I like books like my movies - catch you straight away and keep you interested.If you haven't already you should check out Jeff Noon - the guys sensational."
2,Shame on you Mr Gibson!,"This book was apparently assembled from globs of text that were left over from Virtual Light and Idoru. It builds towards a climax that fails to happen, as if Gibson couldn't figure where to take the story, or was simply too lazy to invent a decent ending. Gibson should have more respect for his own body of work, not to mention his readers, than to publish a half-... effort like this. I give it two stars only because it's still better than 90 percent of the ... on the shelves at ...."
5,"Like Pulp Fiction...only post apocalyptic, with computers...","I had to read this book twice, the first time through, the first 100 pages or so were a little slow. The stories were just a little to spaced apart for me, and having only read Neuromancer, the characters seemed to rapidly introduced. The last half of the book, however, moved so rapidly, and combined all of the seemingly disjointed storylines from the first half into a smooth flowing mind blowing cataclysmic conclusion. Wow. The second time I read the book, which was after reading Idoru, and Virtual Light, (the other two books in the Rydell/Chevette/Colin Laney/Yamazaki/The Bridge saga) I was absolutely floored. This confirmed my hypothesis, Gibson is a Genious, and his works should be on everyone's shelves, regardless of their degree of technophilia."
1,product does not work - can't get help from CS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The day i got the nikon eg cp14 audio/video cable i tried it and it didn't work. I tried to contact the seller and no response. my # 314-337-1617 my address PO Box 38023 st. louis, mo. 63138 email: kenndaniels@juno.com all i want is a correct working cable!!!!!!!"
3,Video cable.,It worked okay but the cables didn't seam to fit just right like the original set. Got a new camera shortly after this purchase.
4,cute house,"Recently purchased this house for my almost 2-year old daughter. We have it set up in our playroom. Same troubles as everyone else putting it together, need a good drill to get screws in since there are no pre-drilled holes. Overall look is adorable with the hearts and pink shutters and door. Daughter loves playing in it. Loves the door-bell and phone sounds. Large enough inside that we added a kid-sized plastic chair, her doll stoller and other items. Loves the ""cook-top"" which we also accessorized with plastic plates and pots. Book racks inside only hold incredibly small books. Door is tight, but inside is tall enough. Even my very tall 7 year-old son couldn't resist going in a few times, though he had to squat a little bit inside."
3,Too Small to do very much !!,"This house is so cute. The Sweetheart playhouse is so to small though. You could only fit 1 of anything in it. I am so dissapointed. I would have rather spent more money and got a house she could sit a little table in or a chair , just somthing. It took 5 Min to assem. so easy. I would look into a larger house that 2-3 litle girls could fit in."
5,Great playhouse for Grandchildren,"This is the second one of this playhouse that I have purchased. One for MeMe's house and one for their house. It is a great playhouse for the money. It is heavy duty and my granddaughters will get years of fun out of them. Only one little thing, on the second one that I order, there were not enough screws."
4,good information,"This book is very short but filled my head with alot of ideas. As I continued to read it, I pictured my daughter's ceremony happening.Although it refers to local groups (in England)for assistance alot; and considering I live in Boston-I had to be creative with some of our planning. We ended up using the Justice of the Peace that married us as a ceremony leader- which she was very happy to do for us ! The price I paid (for shipping from the U.K.) was ridiculous so I hope other books from this series will make it to the U.S. used book racks soon."
1,Not an e-Book,"This is a bit of a cheek! This is not a Kindle book at all. It is a scanned book with a half-bad attempt at a digit table of contents. Cannot search, cannot reference. Material is also outdated. It is not a Apache2 book. It is an Apache 1.3 book with some references to 2.0Overall a disappointment in buying it :-("
2,Never Buy Used,Well when i puchased the watch it had cosmetic damage wasnt new looking at all and would not sync to sats for GPS after the watch died a few times the GPS worked. the USB cable that was send to me was faulty will not read to the computer looked it up seems that is was a fault in the cables but i dont have a warranty that the owners had so cant get the cable with out paying out right. The face of the watch fell off weeks later seeint that it is poorly constructed and the GPS kills the watch in an hours or so after you have a good lock.
5,A Lesson Before Dying,"This was the book on CD, unabridged version, and it is great. I purchased this for a college class, and needed to save time due to 10 other novels I needed to read in the same semester. It has been a blessing I have listened to this now more than once, and the speaker is great! His inflections and tone are just fabulous, it is really an enjoyable listen!"
3,Needs better proofreading,"The book's style is clear so you do not have to be a Scholar of history (which I am not) to understand the material presented. I believe that most readers will enjoy the opportunity to learn more about topics covered in the novel. However, it is disturbing that only sixteen pages into the book there are two obvious mistakes that leave one questioning the accuracy of the book and facts discussed. They have the conclave system beginning dated to July 7, 1724 then state that the first conclave election occurred in 1276. They state that the first Pope to use two names (Albino Luciani) did so in 1978 by selecting John Paul, but then say there is a John Paul XXII several pages later. These most likely are typos but still troubling all the same considering the book's genre (i.e. it is not a romance novel). I don't know if any of the book's twelve editors assisted with proofreading but the next printed edition needs a tighter review of the text."
4,It's no secret!,The wide variety of viewpoints from numerous scholars was refreshing and informative. They clarified numerous 'facts' that had been (mildly) distorted by Dan Brown's novel. The book could stand on its own as a good read.
2,Another one who glides in the success of others,"Its obvius that Angels and Demons is a novel (a great one indeed), and that Dan Brown is a writer that writes fiction based in reality, but as he writes he includes many facts mixed with fiction, something that the common reader might mistake as reality.A book like this is helpful to the people with lazzyness to read about the different topics to do their own research, but what is not fair is to take advantage of the success of others, as all this books of interpretation, secrets, etc. of Angels and Demons and The Davinci Code are trying to make a profit out of others effort and success."
3,Exact replacement.,My Panasonic is 25 years old and repair parts are diffficult to locate. In spite of the part number changing these were the correct replacement parts.
5,western fiction,This has been one of the most instresting books that I have recently read.I plan to make this part of my permanate library.I will certainly look for more of this authors books.This author has either done alot of research into his characters and stories or he actually was involved someway in the incidents.
4,love reading,Just love to read about the old west. These are stories that our grandchildren love to hear. Plan to buy more of these.
4,A much-needed book for children of open adoption,"As closed adoptions become a thing of the past (and good riddance), books like Pugnose will be more and more needed for the children of open adoption. The only thing that could improve this cute book is more readable type. The illustrations are precious."
4,good practice,In preparing for the dental board I wanted some practice questions I came across this book and found it helpful. The questions were similar format to those I got on the written portion of the board exam. And some questions if you study them differently you learn a lot. eg some quest would be all of the followin except. What I did was ready the question and learn the four choices. Good book for practice.
3,does what it's supposed to do...,...but it's not worth the trouble if you constantly switch between the keyboard and the mouse. And of course it's useless for games or any situation where you need high precision.
1,Chinese Junk - Broke Twice in 30 Days,"Broke mechanically in ONE hour of use, a plastic part inside that holds the buttons in place came lose and was rattling around inside and the buttons kept falling out. I fixed this myself. Within three or four weeks the mouse started to halt and hang during movement, the Chinese electrical parts failed. Awful manufacturer's support. Good ergo design rendered useless by poor Chinese quality control. DO NOT buy this mouse."
4,History of Education,"I thought this book was an excellent combination of information and facts. Not only was it easy to find the information you wanted but it was also very interesting, unlike many of these kinds of books. I think it is an excellent rescource for any teacher or person wanting to know about education and how we got where we are."
3,The wrong Book,"I actually ordered the nineth edition and got the eight instead. I have been able to make it work although I have had to have other students give me some of the homework assignments because the version I have doesn't have ""focusing on the issues"" and the pages are different and the info is outdated. Hopefully next time I order throught here I will recieve the right one. Other then that, it came on time and was easy to order."
5,Brother Ketchup,"This album rocks and funks as much as anything, anywhere. Fantastic -- my #1 favorite album of any genre."
5,Really good value,Get the Pro model so you can ride the thing back from school when your kid chooses to ride it there.I did :)Excellent value; very solid and the Pro version lets adults ride too. BARGAIN!
4,"works well with heavy use, but be careful over cracks and bumps","well designed for 'harsh' demand of usage. Intended more for adult and professionals, but I find it actually easier to maneuver than the other razors because of the beefier handles.Regardless of which Razor you use, you need to pay particular attention while you go over bumps or cracks on the street---due to smaller wheels and no springs, it is very easy to tip over forward if the Razor runs across uneven surfaces.If you have kids using this, you should definitedly get helmets and hands/knees paddings."
4,Good for tall people/ adults,I got it for my 18 old son to use it as transportation around college. Good choice for tall people.
5,Very Satisfied,"After my kid's scooter bit the dust, it was great to recieve the replacement pro model quickly. Thanks for the prompt service."
5,My Kids Love This Scooter!,"My kids have every razor scooter out there, as well as a couple zoomies. They love the razor pro model. The gripping covers the entire top of the scooter. It has a smooth ride and is very light. Although I have never personally ridden it, from what my kids tell me, it was a great buy."
4,Very Durable,"The Pro model is made quite a bit stronger than the other models. I find it is a little small for adults. I wish the wheels were bigger, and that it was longer, but it is a good value and will last a lifetime."
5,Razor Pro Model Scooter,"I brought the scooter for my twelve year old daughter who loves scooting. She has been through three other scooters so far. It has been three months, so far so good. She loves this scooter very much and uses it everyday."
4,Razor Pro Model Scooter,"The Razor scooter is very strong and will withstand any trick that you can come up with, but the grip tape is very poor. In approximately 3 weeks, it will start to split and come off on the corners. Your best bet is to buy skateboard grip tape and re-due the deck.This scooter is only available on-line; the retail stores do not carry."
3,Watch your ankle bone...,"The scooter has one, but very annoying design fault - when you lift it up to clear an obstacle, i.e. curb, the platform swings around the steering column, and invariably the metal ridge hits owner right into the ankle bone.After several very painful lessons, I've finally learned to lift the damn platform all the way up, way higher than it's necessary to clear the obstacles... so the last few times I used the scooter I managed to avoid injuries.The other, lesser problem is that steering column rotates 360 and when mounting the scooter it's very easy inadvertently grab it when it's turned 180. The problem is that with steering turned 180, the scooter is much less stable - the problem that becomes apparent only much later during the ride, i.e. when you decide to take one hand off the steering.As for riding qualities of the scooter, I found them to be ok, although not spectacular. LIt would be nicer if it had larger wheels."
3,"Fun. But no suspension, confusing assembly, and poorly-fitting part","At first when I bought this I wasn't sure if I got a wrong part of bad instructions. Turns out it was bad instructions. You have to extend the handlebar all the way out before you can fasten it to the bottom of the scooter. And it won't glide on easily, even after loosening. You have to push and turn it. Grab the wheel between your foot and push down and turn on the handle to get it in all the way, then tighten it.Also the hole on the inside of the bottom part of the scooter is too narrow for the bottom of the telescoping handlebar neck thing to fit in, so you cannot collapse it all the way. If you try, the handlebar ends up sticking a few inches beyond the back of the scooter.And other than that this is a great scooter, handles weight well. The only thing is there is no suspension, so if you go on sidewalk cracks or rough asphalt you'll get shaken up."
5,best scooter i have seen,"My grandson loves this scooter. It is really ruggedly built and is well balanced. I guess they no longer make titanium scooters, but this one is made of pretty strong aluminum."
5,razor pro scooter,delivered quickly; 11 year old twins love them; very easy to assemble; will ride to school and back daily; excellent wheels
3,Incorrect assembly instructions and parts,"This would have been a great purchase with the exception that once I got it, I got out the instructions, which seemed easy enough but could not fit the rod into the bottom, no matter what I did. I broke a sweat for 40 minutes before calling customer support. After being on hold for 20 minutes, the woman informed me that there is a known problem with this scooter that there is an incorrect part and that she was going to email me new instructions for putting it together and that it if I could not get the rod in, she'd send me a new rod which did not have the problem. I was astounded that the company would knowingly sell the product with a part that was defective and said so to the representative. She informed me that since the part did not present a safety issue, it was not recalled. She did apologize for the inconvenience. Crazy.Once it was finally put together, I am enjoying it, but I would not ever purchase again."
4,Just a Great Scooter,"For the people that aren't 12 anymore and continue to like to ride scooters, the Razor Pro is the only model with a sufficient weight capacity. The design of the scooter is simple and functional and the folding mechanism works well. If you like to ride scooters and you're too heavy for Razor's A3 model (which includes suspension for a smoother ride) this is the way to go!"
5,"The grandosn knew what he wanted, and was happy!","We received this scooter in a very timely manner......We had no problems with it! Our grandson is 14 and weighs about 185 and wanted a scooter. He did the redearch and this model is rated to 200lbs. Great buy, nice item."
5,Good kick scooter for men,"The performance and design is nice.For women, average not over 160 lbs, model A2 and A3 is suitable. However, this pro is perfectly suited for men with the longer hands as well as 220 lbs supports."
4,Razor Pro Model Scooter,Scooter works well. Kids love it. Make sure handle bars are in the correct direction when opening from the folded position.
5,Razor Scooter Pro Model,The Pro Model Razor has performed excellent. It is much sturdier than the lesser models. I highly recommend to purchase the pro model when purchasing this product. It is slightly more expensive but is worth the extra cost.
4,DECENT & STURDY ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE...( B+),"I am 6'2"" 195lb. I just got one cause it was cheap and more convenient than hauling a bike around campus. No complaints besides the brakes being pretty weak, granted I am on the upper level of weight limit, and when going pretty fast (i.e. downhill) the frame feels a bit shaky and unstable. This isnt really a problem though, assuming you have decent control and reaction speed in case something WERE to happen. Once again, Im factoring in the low price and the convenience, and the fact that its sort of meant for kids. It works for someone my size and it cuts my walking time in less than half."
4,Solid Ride,This is a very nice scooter. It feels sturdy when it rides and can sure take a beating as well. If you're into more intense riding and tricks then this is the perfect scooter for you. The deck has a cool design and I liked how there's grip tape over the whole thing. The wheels are a little slow and I'm thinking of replacing them but for now they're fine still.Good scooter for the price.
4,Very nice and sturdy for Adults,"This is one scooter that is specifically made for adults. I weigh about 200 pounds and loved the way this scooter would carry me. For people who haven't used scooters before, the one thing to note is that it will need a lot of effort pushing yourself around on these things. Althought going on a flat surface or a downslope gives the best experience, even a small incline will make the use impossible because of the amount of effort required."
2,came with a defective part.,"it would have been great had it had the parts machined correctly. On the stick that the handle bars attach to, it was not fitting into the base and there was no way to make it work. It needed a replacement part, but my husband never wanted to deal with it, so it was forgotten. My son rides his bike, rip stick, and skate board instead. I think this was just one of the few defective ones???"
5,Nice,"ive own this scooter and it has severd me well. if you are an advancing scooterer,like me, i would recomend this scooter or the A2 or A3 VERY sturdy. great scooter."
4,Excellent CD!,"I remember that zune recommnded this album to me a few years ago, and I loved it. I was at first, hesitate because I read from alot of places that this is where her career took a nose dive. But i gotta say this has to be one of her best cd's. Put yourself in my place is a great upbeat ballad, and Kylie can really sing well on this song. The video is pretty cool as well. It def. reminds me of madonna or britney spears. Confide in me was a pretty kickbutt hiphop type song as well. I really liked this song. A fe of the other trcks had the same feel as well. I wish i had this cd to listen to again! It's def. a must have for any fan of pop music. This has to be one of her best albums. It's a shame it's very undrrated."
3,"memorable, but doesn't quite work","This film is experimental: the dialogue is in verse, there are long moments of visual poetry, and the actors often stare at each other in long silences. In many ways, there is potential for this to be a great film. The actors are wonderful and completely believable, the plot is realistic and completely rings true. But somehow, it didn't come together, at least in my viewing.Recommended as a worthy attempt with plenty of innovation."
2,Hi I am from Nepal,Hi I am Sonam Sherpa from NepalI would like to travel in France so I would like to have a book from you thank you
1,Spec Ops II Green Berets,"I am a player of many games, and have the age and knowledge to expect more from a software engineer. This game was poorly put together, and rushed to the retail shelves. The 3d graphics are all pixelated and full of errors. If you think that its my system,nope, P3 500 two 12 mg Voodoo2 SLI. Don't go thinking that this is in the same catagory as Red Storms Rainbow Six series. Doesn't come close to that game. I wouldn't except this game as a gift."
1,Pac-Man is a better game than this,"The game is all hype. The pictures on the box, ha, it is justto attract you. I never saw any graphis like that. The graphicsaren't only bad, but Id like to know how to shoot the enemy, when they are invisible! I only gave it 1 star, because no stars wasn't an option! It was the #1 game on my Christmas list, but it was the worst software ever made. ATTENTION PARENTS DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF $30+, NOW THAT I'VE SEEN IT, YOU COULDNT GIVE IT TO ME."
1,The WORST game in the world.,I went to the store and bought the game.I was so exited.Then after i installed it i played a practice misson and i was spinning in circles.The game was messed up.My advice is to never by this game or any other ripcord games.
5,Fun and easy to teach,"Usually my son groans when I pull out a workbook, but he really loves hands-on science projects, especially if HE is the one who gets to do the experiments. This book is great for that and he actually REQUESTS that we pull this book out and do a project. It is easy to understand and easy to teach from, given that it's been 25 years since I did any of this in school myself. Also, you should know that there is not a specific ""grade level"" demarcation in the book, such that it goes through first grade up to point A and then to second grade up to point B and then to third grade thereafter. The lessons just flow along and can easily be started at any point in first through third grade and even repeated a couple of times as the child gets older and can understand the concepts on a deeper level. Likewise for Book 2. It's basically aimed at fourth through sixth grade, but could be started earlier if the child has gone through Book 1 quickly and is hankering for more."
4,Great start for science,"This is a pretty good book. You can use the themes and ideas for almost any age (I was able to use many of the ideas for a preschool age child). That said, there are not many themes - you will need another science book for a full curriculum if you plan on using it for homeschooling. Enough themes for about a semester of work."
5,MAFIA 100 AÑOS DE PODER!!!!,"EXCELENTE LIBRO DE ERIC FRATTINI, HISTORIA DETALLADA Y RESUMIDA DE LOS GRANDES CLANES Y FAMILIAS DE LA MAFIA EN LOS ULTIMOS 100 AÑOS, SI TE ATRAPA ESTE TIPO DE HISTORIAS CON LOS GRANDES CAPO-MAFIOSOS, Y AUN NO LEISTE NADA SOBRE EL TEMA, TE RECOMIENDO ESTE LIBRO DESDE UNA PERSPECTIVA INVESTIGATIVA E HISTORICA.ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO!!!"
4,Great follow up in the series!,"I loved the second book in the series and I loved the sexual tension created between Adrien and Jake! Tortuous, beautiful but worth the wait! Even I was getting anxious! We get to know a little bit more of Jake - but not enough for Adrien or the reader! A good murder mystery. Well-developed characters and plot. Looking forward to next book and next book."
2,Wow...,"I may be all alone in this, but I couldn't even get anywhere because the game would freeze once a dialogue sequence came up. Perhaps I should have read beforehand to see if this game would run on Windows XP.If you get past the mediocre graphics and voice acting, I think the game had some potential to be entertaining in the least. It sure would be nice to have been able to finish it though.I like closure. :-)"
2,Not even Grant could help this battle; WWW:SA is a loss,"Yikes! I wasn't to crazy for a WWW game, since the movie put me to sleep with my head in a popcorn bucket, and as it turns out, this poor excuse of a game put the career of Will Smith a few leaps downward. First, the graphics are just plain awful. The voice acting is another big letdown, since Will Smith's voice sounds like a hobo in New York. On the plus side, WWW:SA provides a good aresenal of weapons, ranging from the revolver to the Dual Coil Lightning Ejector Rifle. There are some neat puzzles, but the most is crappy. This attempt to make a bad movie good has failed, and if you want the true joy of WWW, go dig up that old TV series."
2,great movie bad game,"The movie was one of the best western movies I have seen, but the game was awful. The graphics were acceptable, but the controls are awful and so is gameplay. I have three words for you, don't buy it."
4,Peppy Feel Good Fun,"In an era where many artists feel the need to be political outspoken - Paolo Nutini puts the fun back into music. From the peppy riffs and beats to the feel good lyrics, you just can't help but love the bubble gum happy music of These Streets!"
4,There will be 5 stars down the road,"The only reason I didn't give Paola Nutini five stars is that I wish there were just a few more up-tempo numbers. Don't get me wrong, all of the songs on this CD are very good, it's just that I like songs that make me want to move more than I like songs that move me. Nutini has a great voice and a nice way with a tune. How good will he be in five years?"
5,My new favorite disc!,"I could listen to this CD all day! These songs have such feeling to them. ""New Shoes"" was the reason why I bought it, just because it's fun and I have a shameless shoe addiction, but the other less upbeat melodies such as ""Last Request"" and ""Loving You"" keep me listening over and over. Great CD!"
5,amazing,"he sounds nothing like james blunt or teddy gieger!my mom bought this cd because of the cover and now where ever we are we always are listening ! I really like the uk video version of ""newshoes"" . is wonderful and funny. my personal favorite songs are ""jenny dont be hasty"" and ""new shoes""but i also like ""million faces"" and the others"
5,Brilliant new artist & 1st CD,"This is such a feel good CD....especially New Shoes which will have you up and dancing. If you're feeling a little low, just put this on and you'll feel better in no time. Paolo has a very sexy voice....he just oozes sex appeal! I'll be coming back for more. Check out his myspace page if you'd like to see the videos. You can also go directly to their site and sign up for information about new music and concert dates. This guy is so talented that I'm sure he's going to be a huge sucess! He was inspired by artists like Van Morrison so, how can you go wrong?"
3,"Good, but let's not get carried away","A reviewer unabashedly called this ""the best album in decades,"" and even threw out a comparison to Paul McCartney. Folks, this isn't even the best album of the month it was released. That honor would go toTill The Sun Turns Black.This album is good, especially considering that it is the debut work of a teenager. Reviewers commented on how ""addictive"" the album is and how the songs will be ""stuck in your head,"" which is true, but that's not at all the same as saying that the songs are mesmerizing or moving or immense. This album is not far from the dreaded Easy Listening or Adult Alternative genres--it's pleasant, radio-friendly stuff from a skilled musician, but let's please not drop our panties about it."
