4,Excellent bargain for general use or video games,"I agree with an earlier review that these speakers lack ""presence."" However, I think that characteristic makes them better for general music or video games than for watching movies, at least with my stereo (2 channel) setup. It is easy to tell that voices and sounds are coming from the speakers, rather than feeling like they come from the television itself. They have a lot of bass and can handle all 120 watts from my HK stereo receiver. I love playing video games through these speakers. Explosions and other sound effects really pack a punch!"
1,Book of Shadows (Blank),"Are we all mad???? No really? This is a nice book. Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost? The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings. It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune. It is the content which is valuable not the coverings. Sorry to be so negative. Blessed be!"
1,Is this for real?,The last thing anyone needs is an overpriced journal designated for recording their spells and experiences. Any journal would do if one feels it's neccesary to record SECRET information. Keep in mind by writing these secrets down puts the craft at risk to misinterpration and brakes the bond of trust and silence.
4,The Book Of Shadows RULES,"The Book Of Shadows is the most awesome book ever! It goes so cool with the show ""Charmed."" That's why I bought it. Ever since then, my religion has been wicca."
3,Okay for Some,"This is indeed, a marketing tool. However, it is a very good one at that. The quality of the paper and pages is much better than those even found in professional-written books. It is just a notebook, but it is a very well-made one. It can withstand the assaults of time and paper-eating bugs. The binding is also well-done. It is not a haphazardly-made product. However, it is a little too expensive for just good paper bound together. I would advise you to buy it if you're a real Wicca lover, or even a collector, but if you're a fun-seeking person, the answer is no."
3,Just be sure you really want it...,"When I purchased this book, things were looking good. The first few pages and spells turned out pretty nice, and I thought I had found my Book of Shadows. But then, as time went on, feelings of doubt and superficialism and ""meaninglessness"" filled my mind whenever I turned the pages. Now I've waited for my Book to come to me instead of myself having to come to it, and I am truly happy. It's my belief that those on the magickal road should also do the same.But, if you truly feel buying this specific journal is the correct path for you, then of course I can only wish you the best.Merry Part and Blessed Be!"
5,nice looking book,"I do have to say that this is an awesome journal, it's filled with enough pages and space to write and do whatever you need to do, The binding it great and it's pretty darn durable!I recommend making your own, but this one is cool cause the general idea is already there and everybody needs one."
5,wow its perfect for a wiccan like me!,I bought this several days ago and when i got it I was amazed how big it was. I started writing in it right away and let me tell you. the pages don't rip (aren't brittle) and there is so much space to put my spells in and all i want to learn about the wiccan/pagan religion.. thanks it's a great help to someone like me!
4,Dos Mundos 1995 edition,This is for an older edition of Dos Mundos. Probably came out in 1995. The book is helpful if used in conjunction with other materials. It has some good grammar sections but one might need more than what is in this book. Dos Mundos assumes that you are in a classroom so some of the material seems brief. I don't totally trust the vocabulary section but the problem is that Spanish is so widely used that words change from country to country.
5,Well designed and built case,"I am very pleased with this case - the first time I have assembled a micro-btx unit. It is nicely designed and solidly built. The finished system looks nice, runs cool and is totally quiet. One of the nice features of this case vs. others is that it includes the power supply."
1,Horrible Book,"Thank God I visited my local Borders and went to the publisher's website before purchasing this book. The ""wild effects"" taught are nothing short of awful looking. Don't just take my word for it, you can actually view the ToC with sample photos at the publisher's website.http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0764598139.html"
1,Don't bother,"This book is nothing more than some very poor examples of how to make the most annoying pictures possible using filters in the most obnoxious way possible. Looking through the book, I saw MAYBE 1 thing I could use. If you are someone who just wants to make goofy pictures using nothing more than filters, you may get some use out of it, if you're a graphic designer / professional, don't waste your time or money."
2,not for novice...,"I am going through this book aftter Adobe's Classroom in the book and Deke's One-on-One. I think the workshop examples are a little too advanced for Photoshop beginner. I think this is the type of book you can learn more by going through 2 or 3 times after the first read.However, this book is very difficult to follow, even though I sit down and go through the chapter slowly. I am going to put this book aside as it gets me frustrated as I loose track of what the author is writing. I have been reading many other graphics books for Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Painter, and MX2004. But, this is the first book I had a difficulty to following the lessens."
1,The original was 90 minutes--what happened to the other 15?,"I watched this on TV when it aired and a couple more times when it was rerun. Imagine my dismay upon buying the DVD and discovering it was fifteen minutes shorter than the original.Is it College Yet was even worse--90 minutes cut down to just over 60.MTV has released Beavis and Butt-Head on DVD; when are we going to get non-bootleg, uncut Daria episodes and movies?"
5,Daria come alive in DVD!,"...This movie itself is really cool - you see the characters' transistion as they move up in life, and they do tackle real world issues. Grab your copy now!I am really amazed and I give two thumbs up to the creators of Daria, and their whole cast and crew, for making such a wonderful series. And I do hope somehow, Daria comes back after college - wouldn't it be nice to see 'Daria: Is it 5pm Yet?'. Or maybe a real Daria movie w/ real people to act...hmmm... ;-)"
5,"Classic Cartoon, Hillarious Movie!","A great movie of one of the best cartoons ever created. MTV's Daria was a hillarous spoof on modern high school culture. It has sadly ended though, with a 2nd movie ""Is It College Yet?"" coming soon. I don't have this item yet, but I taped it when they showed it on MTV. ""Is It Fall Yet"" is about the struggles of summer break, with Daria's signature sarcastic outlook. This is my all-time favorite TV show and I would love to see the entire series out on DVD. Without Daria, MTV is mostly just Real World re-runs and overplayed music videos."
4,Daria- is it fall yet?,Not in the same spirt as classic Daria but the die hard fans will still enjoy
5,One of my favorite TV shows,"Daria is one of my favorite TV shows. When the idea of spinning her off from Beavis and Butthead was announced, I hoped for the best, but feared the worst. I got a little better than I hoped for. By surrounding her with an assortment of people and developing them (especially Quinn), they succeeded in making her seem like a real person.This movie is as good example as any. The movie ended the fourth season (they threw in the last two episodes of that season, which sort of act like an intro to the movie). My only real complaint is that the removed the background music from the episodes. They also had to change some of the background music in the episodes (probably rights issues). The background music is another thing they did very well, and it is missed in the episodes. I really hope they put out the other movie and the rest of the episodes."
1,Avoid for children of any age,"Unfortunately, I bought each book for my seven year old son. Even he could not believe how ""horrible"" Henry behaved with absolutely NO consequences. One book has Henry singing about hitting an old person on the head with a cane. I am ""horrified"" that these books are published and further shocked they have been endorsed by parents. These books are so deplorable I will not pass along to friends or donate. They will end up in the garbage where they belong. Reckless content pretty much sums it up. Oh, I looked at the author's photo and let's just say I wasn't surprised."
3,Review,"I think the series has a little too much toilet humor for me. I have a nephew that found it hysterical, but my family thought it was a tad rude. The humor is typically British so you need to understand that."
2,Not Made in Germany-Made in the Peoples Republic of China,"I've owned Rosle's for years and years. Bought this one as an extra to have around and when I opened the package I saw ""China"" and not Made in Germany. Apparently the executives at Rosle are enhancing the company short term profits this way however in my case now it's Bye Bye Rosle."
5,Great spoon,I purchased this spoon for my son who loves to cook. He has other pieces from this company and they are excellent kitchen tools. I highly recommend this spoon.
5,Great book to learn about Napoleon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Many people have heard of the legendary general, and emporer, Napoleon Bonaparte. But, what most people don't know is about Napoleon's love-life. Delderfield describes the six most important women in Napoleon's love life, as well as many others. They impacted his life and what he did in his empire. Behind the man who did it all, was a loving caring emperor. These affairs did not last forever, however, and usually ended badly. Overall this book was incredibly enriched with information about this great man. I recommend it for all people interested in history."
3,"Loud wistiling noise is annoying, although cheap and does the job","I bought two of these switches, one for a client and one for myself. The cheap price is the good side of the story. Although the switch does the job both of the ones I bought are producing a very annoying wistling noise, which is not a good match for a home network, unless you can stick it somewhere far away from your workspace, so the noise doesn't bother you."
2,A Rare Strike Out for Beginners Series,"I have several Writers and Readers Beginners Documentary Comic Books and I love them. However, Philosophy for Beginners is a big disappointment. Not only do I think it is superficial and biased, it lacks the humor and imaginative presentation of the other books in this series."
2,Not worth the price...,"Although this book contains very nice illustrations, it lacks a thorough examination of central philosophical concepts and at some times reverts to all list of philosophers with a few keywords to describe them. Especially horrible is the section on the german idealists! The author has obvious marxist sympathies and he lets his personal opinion come to the surface when describing the other philosophers."
1,Cartoon book that the Aurthor used to promote his anti-christian bigotry.,"Should be renamed, Philosophy for Atheist and Muslim Children.Save the $10. You can buy better fire starting paper for a cheaper price."
4,"good, if biased, introduction to philosophy","I am someone who bought this book looking for an introduction to the history of philosophy and a starting point from which to explore individual philosophers. I believe this book succeeds in delivering that. I feel that the publishers allowed personal bias to color the treatment of certain philosophers, especially, as another reviewer said, post-Marx philosophers. For example, in some of the pages that cover Wittgenstein, the book's artist draws this philosopher with his hair curled into devil's horns. Still, a very worthwhile purchase for someone who has attempted to dive into philosophy previously but had found it too complex to pick up at an arbitrary point."
3,The work was to individual specific,"I felt that the book spent too much time covering individual philosphers, and not enough time spent discussing concepts. One of the best starter books as far as Philospohy goes is Does The Center Hold? I belive it was written by a man named palmer"
3,"All Clear Until Marx, Then Take a Left into the Swamp","The first half has some clear sketches and makes a handy reference, but the second half wanders off. The author is too enamoured of Marx and his descendents and misstates Rawls. Probably as a result, he concludes that philosophy and science have left the world in a ""huge mess"". But don't worry, I think that only applies to Marxist-descent philosophers."
3,"Needs to be PROOFED--where are you, publisher?","The book was a good introduction--I've just become interested in exploring the (BIG) topic of philosophy and this was a non-intimidating way to approach the topic. I have ideas now about which philosophers I would most like to explore in a more detailed fashion.But the typos and grammatical errors in the book (almost every page, it seemed!) made it distracting and downright annoying to read. The publisher should know that readers DO notice and care--if we're smart enough to be interested in this topic, we WILL notice these mistakes. It makes an interesting text on the part of the writer look hasty, haphazard, and cheap. I would avoid purchasing additional books from the publisher because the lousy editing was THAT distracting, but I would buy another book by the author."
3,Concise and accurate but not comic.,"An excellent review of all of Philosophy witheven a certain amount of ""inside"" humor butsomehow less than satisfying.If you sort of like this book, but wish it werea little more something, then you must check outLarry Dronick's Comic History of the Universe.I'm on my over there to write a review now.Cheers,R.O. Despain"
1,Terrible. Waste of money,"Nikon recommends only using this charger and batteries in my coolpix, but they stink. Do not waste your money on these. I am going to my local camera store to see what they recommend for this camera, then these will be thrown away."
1,Nikon Coolpix accessory kit,"As others have stated, this kit is a total waste of money. It only lasts for about 10 pictures before it loses it's charge. It almost makes using the camera unenjoyable to use, as you constantly have to worry when the batteries will die. I don't use it anymore, I buy the CR-V3 batteries."
1,Batteries Don't Hold A Charge!,"As everyone else has noted, the Nikon rechargable batteries only last for a couple of flash pictures before they go dead."
1,No good - don't waste your money,"I've had this ""accessory kit"" for a few months and the batteries only get worse and worse. I don't know what to suggest instead, but there has to be better out there. I like to keep an extra CRV3 battery around for when these batteries get too low and start making taking pics more obnoxious than fun. It isn't rechargeable but at least it lasts for days instead of a few minutes."
1,Not worth it,"After my Nikon 2100 went through my Durcell alkaline AAs like water I was prepared to plunk down $30 on rechargable batteries (and a case). I returned the kit within a week. If you have a digial camera, or other digital device that eats through regular batteries, invest in Energizer E2s - they're much more expensive than standard AA but the difference is worth it. The rechargable batteries in the Nikon Kit lasted for less than 20 pictures before dying - two E2 AAs have lasted for over 200 pictures. Do not get this item."
2,Doesn't maintain charge,"While I haven't had the bad luck of less than ten shots per charge, I do find that I am charging after 20, give or take a few depending of the use of red-eye reduction, etc... I do wish I had researched the battery issue a bit more before purchasing these. I know the first set I had, which were lithium, lasted a LOT longer and I was surprised at the life of them.My advice, read a few of the reviews before you buy. And don't expect these to be long life batteries."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"Both the case and the batteries are functional, but I'd recommend spending a little more money on a case of better quality and some CRV3 batteries.The neoprene case is good if you want to carry your camera around in your purse because its not bulky, but its not a good idea to use this case regularly as it doesn't offer much padding. Also, what's on the inside holding the Nikon logo on scratches the camera.The batteries are okay for back up, but definitely don't expect to go on a day excursion or even a birthday dinner with them. They work okay for about 15 minutes, and then the camera starts to really slow down (i.e. the picture is taken a full 4 or 5 seconds after hitting the shutter button, and then it takes another 15 seconds or so to save the picture to memory). After about an average of 2 hours the batteries are pretty much done."
4,I don't get it?,"I don't understand why everyone keeps saying that it's only a few flash pictures with this battery set, perhaps they didn't charge the batteries fully first because according to my picture labeler I've taken over 100 flash pictures on one charge. The case is kind of handy, especially with the little pouch for an extra CF card. I definately consider this accessory kit a must have, along with another higher capacity CF card. I keep a spare CRV3 lithium battery with me in case I run out of power, but so far I haven't needed it yet."
2,zebra anamalz review,"I am displeased with this item. About 2 months after giving it to our son the ear fell off. We have many many other anamalz and they are all very durable and well made. The body of this product is also different than the others we have. This one is not completely rounded and it appears to be an older model? Anyways, I would not purchase this particular zebra anamalz because its not the same high quality as the others. I feel the seller is selling an old model. I'm out of my return period and so have to keep this thing. The more that I look at it there are other things that are less than perfect about it and I should have just returned it right away. I should also mention we had another zebra anamalz that my son lost on a walk....its body was fully rounded and the quality was amazing! I guess having had two different zebra's pretty much convinces me that this one is definitely an old model. Boo to this seller!"
2,Slow and klunky document scanning,"Had HP-3015 multifunction, but wanted color so spent $1000 for HP-9130. This has stupid scanning software and scanning is 10th as fast compared to HP-3015. Slow printing and copying too. Get a demo before buying!!!"
1,A BIG PIECE OF JUNK,"DO NOT BUY NEW. DO NOT BUY USED. THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK EVER MADE AND SOLD TO THE UN-SUSPECTING PUBLIC. THE SCANNER DOES NOT WORK. THEREFORE NO COPYING, NO FAXING, NO SCANNING. ONLY HALF-ASSED PRINTING. THE PAPER TRAYS STINK AND ARE USELESS. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO DETER YOU FROM EVEN THINKING OF THIS PIECE OF CRAP."
2,no good,"I have been unhappy with this AIO from day one. It prints okay, but ditto other reviewer's complaint about envelopes. Scanner software incompatible with IE 7.0 and the ""fix"" doesn't help at all. I have to scan from the Start-printers & faxes - scanners & cameras - etc. to do any scanning. And paper jas all the time if tray is full.All-in-all, not worth the price - especially compared to my old HP multi-function. I kick myself every time I think that I got rid of it for THIS!!!"
4,Go to Bed Fred,Very good condition. A few pages have a few wrinkles but they were mentioned in the ad. They don't take away from the overall condition of the book. Thought I was getting the puppet also but fot the condition and the price I can't complain. I recommend this book to anyone with little ones 6 months and up.
3,had potential,It had potential but they had to throw zombies in it. That just ruined it for me. I was hoping it would be as good as Shaolin Vs Lama since it starred Alexander Lou.
4,A Rare Personal Account of Another Culture,"This book is comparable to the stories told by explorers of the Americas of how hard it was to survive outside of one's own culture in a time without our modern amenities like a phone, a translation dictionary, or a guide to local customs. I read it while I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mongolia in 1996 and it helped me understand how much life had changed there in the past ninety years."
3,"Product OK, mister patio not good",Product was ok. shipping on time. they forgot to add in a poker for the fire pit. i called their customer service and they havent gotten back to me. they need to address how they handle their customers. i would go some place else to buy next time.
1,Not as advertised,"I bouht this as a birthday present . My daughter called to tell me that it was impossible to assemble as received. Then I asked her to put a magnet to it , turns out the magnet did attach making it doubtful that it was stainless steel.I hope that his was a mistake and that the replacement will be as advertised."
4,An english explanation,This essay is simple and straightforward. It is a must read for beginners of gematria or theoretical qabalah.
2,Aleister Crowley is a genius,Aleister Crowley is the most brilliant philosopher of all time; but this essay is sadly lacking. For fans of Crowley it is worth getting; but otherwise just skip it by.
5,But not for the casual user...,"This the the California Botanists Bible. But to confidently identify the plants, you need at least stem with leaves and flowers and sometimes seeds too. And you need to understand a specialized botanical vocabulary and be willing to struggle a little.It is not an everyman's book."
4,Almost what I wanted...,"This has the first two albums in their entirety. Except for a single track missing from each, which for me was a little annoying, as I was trying to recall in the store what the original track list was. Otherwise, at the price I paid ($AU18), I'm happy to almost have the first two albums. The mastering isn't bad, although it's unclear if much has been done."
5,Outrageous,"It is outrageous that FREE CITY is not in print. The world needs it. There is no other book like it; not only is it hilarious and entertaining, it warps the way one understands our world. Track it down; you will not be disappointed."
2,"good movie, bad translation to dvd","I bought this version hoping that it would incorporate the scenes I had seen on tv that I hadn't seen in the original theatrical version. It delivered on that point, but the quality of these deleted scenes and extended footage was about as good as a tape you had played a hundred times. It was fuzzy as hell. The view goes from clean to poor too often to ignore. I was told this was because this version was taken off of a foreign laserdisk. I would recommend getting the new bootleg version. It's the dvd with the paper cover. In this version the poor image quality problem has been fixed. So in my opinion, steer clear of this dvd and get the bootleg version."
2,Disappointing,"I must agree with some of the other more negative reviews, this was the first DVD I have bought that truly disappointed me, and I love this movie. The alternate ending was interesting but why wasn't the original included somewhere? Also, the quality in some cases is worse than my VHS copy, almost like in order to have continuity with added scenes worse copies of preexisting scenes were used. Wait, like I should have, for the Special Edition to be re-released."
5,Campbell rocks,"The best of the Evil Dead series this film is a campy funfest. Campbells commentary alone is well worth it as he rips all the cheesy effects. The original ending is interesting and though the directors cut is included, some of the best lines are still in the theatrical release. If you liked the film originally, this version is a definate winner."
4,My hubby's favorite movie,"This movie is by far one of the more interesting of Sam Raimi's early works. Bruce Campbell is the definitive B movie actor and no matter what role he plays, he plays it well.I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband. He'll love it! He's also getting Bruce Campbell's first book for Christmas so the fun can continue."
2,picture quality a disgrace,"The picture quality totally ruined this dvd for me. Just when you're into the film the picture goes from clear & sharp into what can only be described as dirty & grainy..a complete joke. I was so disturbed from what I saw that I lost my concentration through out the film, but the worst was to come in the battle scene at the end..I was almost in tears. please think twice about buying this dvd."
1,Army of Darkness,"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because they don't have a negative setting. This must be the worst movie I have ever seen. In fact I could'nt watch the whole thing. I bought this movie on a recommendation from a friend, now I know it was a joke. I watched about 10 mins, stopped the movie, took the DVD out, and throw it in the trash! So if you want to waste your time and money buy this movie."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"Apparently for some reason, everyone loves this movie. They say watch it with fun friends. I did. It was so bad. There is no plot, it goes from one thing to another with no explanation. Unless you don't know a good movie from a bad one, don't get this. The ""comedy"" in it is so repeatative. He fought the mini version for it seemed like 10 minutes and he fought the deadites in the well for another half hour. The phrase it's so bad it's good don't even apply. It passed that point on how bad it is. The action is horrible, and you shouldn't waste your money or your time on the ""greatness"" this movie supposedly has. Disgrace to movies and horrible spin off of an H.P. Lovecraft theme."
1,"Without Embeth Davidtz, this movie is garbage","The only thing reedeemable about this movie is the beautiful Embeth Davidtz, without her, the movie is pathetic. Honestly, this movie is one of the worst I ever witnessed. ""The Mummy"" doesn't even equal its patheticness, and that is saying something!!"
1,If Evil Dead 1 and 2 were pointless.,"if Evil Dead 1 & 2 were pointless blood fests of carnage, then this is pointless and not scary nor funny Period. The 3rd/final Installment (thank god) is the worst of the worst. your a fan of the trilogy perhaps it appeals to you, this is just my opinion with all due respect."
1,A Bad and Tasteless Film,"This by far is the worst film I have ever seen. Sure, I've had my fair share of bad films, but this one tops them off. The acting stunk in a very big way. I expected this film to scare the socks off of me, but, instead I was shaking my head in full on disgust at the Comedy Relief Film instead of being a true horror flick. Don't waste a second of your time on this film and don't waste your money on it either."
1,HD DVDs don't play on regular DVD players!,"We weren't told this in the product description--what a waste of money. You don't see the ""WORKS ONLY ON HD DVD MACHINES"" sticker on the cover as the seller removed it to hide that fact."
3,"The same good movie, stripped of the good parts!","It's the ""Army of Darkness"" and what more can you say? You love it or you hate it. I loved it - until I bought this DVD (bootleg/director's cut).For some reason, on this version, they stripped out all the really good lines!!! ???BTW - This movie is NOT horror. Has some ""horror"" aspects, but its really a comedy - or it would be if they hadn't stripped out all the good comedy lines in the Bootleg edition."
4,Army of Darkness,"This movie was great, very entertaining and funny. If you love Night of the Living Dead, this is even better."
5,Gimme some sugar baby,"Can you say best trilogy of all time? WOW!!! Bruce is definatly a bad ""Ash"" in this one. Don't forget the magic words....clato, varata, nicto!!"
3,I wouldn't call this a horror movie.,Well this is not what i call a horror movie. I do like it alot but it's just not horror.
3,Early Sam Raimi brilliance,"The highest production cost of the evil dead trilogy. Very campy, great one liners , but does not compare to Evil Dead II"
4,Everything you'd expect,"In reading other reviews I did not expect the b;u-ray to be 'true' B;u-ray but it was just darn fun having this film in my collections. All the lines I love, all the scenes butter than I have seen in years...""Hail to the king baby!"""
4,"Funny, rediculous and cheesy.","The hilarious horror of the first two Evil Dead films is missing in this third instalment. That's OK, though, because the lack of horror has allowed Sam Raimi to develop the ""cheesiness verses evil/sexy fantasy world"" seen later in his glorious Xena and Hercules series. Like Laurel and Hardy, it's hard to tell whether Army of Darkness is under-played or over-played - strange, not Hollywood, and all the better for it. Well done, Sam - I liked your new movie ""A Simple Plan"" too."
3,good for a bad movie,"If you're in the mood for a really bad movie with shoddy special effects and a predictable plot, this is the one to rent. Especially hilarious if you've ever seen the Hercules or Xena series, you'll recognize a couple of actors and many of the effects."
3,"Great, but disgusting.","Fabulous movie, good plot, great humor, but where's the special effects? It's major shortcoming was the excessive gore. Well, it's a good rental anyway..."
4,Go for the boomstick,"If you are a fan of this movie go for the Army of Darkness (Boomstick Edition) insted. The commentary is really funny, and you can even see the entire story board for the movie while watching the movie."
4,"Pure cheese, yet undeniable greatness","This is a movie that has grown on me with age. I love it now for what it is and always has been. Army of Darkness solidified Bruce Campbell as a cult hero and he carries this film with his funny line delivery and one huge chin. The special effects and sets are pretty bad, but it's all about the campy fun from start to finish. There are some classic scenes and lines you will feel compelled to quote to people, probably getting you many blank stares from those who have not witnessed Ash in action.I have the Boomstick version with the original and director's cut. I like them both, but the picture quality sucks on the DC, so I usually watch the theatrical version."
4,A fun watch,"This film was okay. I'm not a huge fan of comedy, but this even made me laugh. There are a couple things that would have been nice if they had been explained, but the dialogue was funny, the acting was decent. It was worth a watch."
4,So bad it's good,"Army of Darkness is a bad movie. It's suppose to be. It's the greatest B-movie of all time. Everytime I watch this film I laugh so hard I usually fall over or something. I don't know which version to recomend. The Director's Cut has some extended scenes that are really funny, but the standard video has the alternate ending which is pretty funny too. Just get which ever you can afford, they're both good"
2,What happened to these films?????,"Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are great, but this film is a major disappointment. The humor is retarded, and the effects are poor for 1992!!! I wish they'd cut out the noticable humor. In Evil Dead, it was funny, but not ridiculous. It was scary, too. But, this one was just soooooooo stupid. It wasn't even scary. I sat through the whole movie, hoping it would end, and laughing at how stupid it was. If they make another Evil Dead movie, PLLLLLEEEEAAASEE make a better one."
3,It's Ok.,"If your not 15 and obsessed with b horror, 'army of darkness' is nowhere near the quality of Evil Dead 2, yes Evil Dead is a classic, just not a very 'good' movie, per se. Army of Darkness tries desperately to recapture the magic of 2, it's kind of like the Matrix sequels. The first made you think, and as soon as i heard they were making sequels, I had to roll my eyes, and my predictions came true. Utter garbage to the first one. I don't think the disparity between 2 and AOD is as large as the matrix sequels, but it is similar. It just stinks of the usual, milking the fanboys ala 'lucas style'Thank God their not re-remaking 2."
5,dabes,"its the best movie ive ever seen in my life and ive seen the matrix trilogy + the exorcist i loved it less gore than id expect form a movie like evil dead but it more than makes up for it with action and comedy ...a comedic,action,slasher not a great idea but sam raimy pulled it off its great man buy it"
4,Funny as Hell!!!,"This movie rules. I haven't seen it in a while, and even still, I can honestly tell you this is one of the best horror/comedies I've seen. Get it now!!"
4,The best,"Better than it's predessors,this movie is hilarious and freaky at the same time.It's off the wall humor is it's best quality."
3,A comical movie,"Army of Darkness had a bigger budget than either Evil Dead movies put together, and yet some of the humor and the creativity got lost with a bigger budget. Although it was still comical, it didn't have the hilarity that the other two had, of course, the humor was more morbid in the first two. Bruce Campbell still gives a great performance as the heroic Ashe.""You found me beautiful once"" ""Yeah, but you got real ugly."" GRADE: B-"
5,Give me some sugar mama!,"What can I say about this classic other than Klatu, barata, nik....cough, cough!!! Love this movie. Watch it, trust me you'll thank me later."
5,"Hail to the King, Baby!","The best camp-cult-horror movie ever made! (in my opinion, of course) So many one-liners its ridiculous... in a good way. Absolute frickin classic. In 1080p HD nonetheless! And this is a helluva deal; ten measely bucks for Ash in HD!"
4,Campy fun,"Campy fun romp through a dark genre. For Campbell fans, a must-have.Interesting to see where Raimi began and where he is now. Amazing whatcan be accomplished with a limited production budget!"
5,hey ugly!,Over the past few years ive introduce my spouse to The Evil Dead films mainly the first two since ive been waiting for them to stop releasing numerous versions of the third one.So I bought The BoomStick Edition and her and I watched it and she was in tears from start to finish.She finally agreed with me that yes Bruce is the man.Army of Darkness is so stupid yet totally watchable even if it does fail to live up to the franchise expectations.Bruce has allready proven his chops recently with Bubba Ho Tep so im hoping that an allout final big boy finale for the Evil Dead series will follow.As much as I would like see Freddy vs Jason vs Ash that will not count no matter how good it may turn out to be as the big finale im craving to see.
5,A Classic Horror-Comedy,"I have seen Army of Darkness over 20 times and still think it is a great movie. My friends and I used to watch this movie all the time. It's a horror movie but it's loaded with comedy. The only thing that bothers me about it is that the windmill scene does not make sense to me. (I'm sure it is explained in the Director's Cut, which I have never seen). This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I can watch it over and over."
4,GREAT FILM,"Army Of Darkness,great film,I thought of it more of a war movie,not much like the first two movies. This movie had a few cheesy stupid parts but overall i loved it.If you like horror/war/action i recomend this movie the whole evil dead series is great"
5,Be sure to take your BOOMSTICK with ya!,"In this third (and probably final) installment of the Evil Dead series, not only do we see a drastic change in scenery (Medieval England instead of American woods), we also see much less graphic content. You don't have internal organs bursting out of human bodies, but living skeletons on fire and breaking apart. There is only a minimal amount of gore, and the black and slapstick humor takes over. But is that necessarily a bad thing? Of course, not. Even though the film has an overall different style, it still has that same sort of wicked charm that the first two film brought out. Plus, you still have Bruce Campbell as the main character, so it's bound to be bad@** throughout. Again, this isn't as violent and daring as the first two Evil Dead films, but it's still very entertaining to watch. I'd give this an A-."
4,A cult classic....,"If you are looking for a gripping drama with an Oscar-caliber script, Army of Darkness is not for you. However, if you have a nose for comedy, think Monty Python-type humor is hilarious, and love to quote movies, then quit reading and get this movie! In fact, if you don't have all three in the Evil Dead series, shame on you!Army of Darkness is one of the best movies to watch with a whole bunch of friends, and can be watched over and over without losing its appeal. If you've ever played the computer FPS game Duke Nukem, then you know half of the script, as many of the quotes were taken directly from AoD."
4,Beware the director's cut,"This was an incredibly funny and entertaining movie with plenty of quoteable Ash'isms. My only recommendation is to steer clear of the Director's cut, which added some filler scenes but cut some of my favorite lines. For instance the ending is different and not nearly as funny/clever as the previous ending.I highly recommend the movie but not the director's cut."
3,"A weal follow-up, but still fun","This third entry in the Evil Dead series is the least of them. The first half of the movie is hilarious, but it quickly runs out of gas and becomes too preoccupied with an interminable battle against an army of skeletons. At this point, the violence gets cartoonish instead of comically gory, like the first two. By the way, that incantation Ash says, ""Clatu Verata Nicto"" is taken from an old science fiction movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" Honest!"
4,Cheesy and fun!,"This is one of those awful cheesy movies that you cant help but watch over and over. Its great fun. Pretty much everything is awful in this from the effects to the acting, but, who cares?! Its such a mesmerizing movie. I cant even say how many times I've seen this since I was young. I don't own the DVD but I should. It really is a great cheesy classic. And no, I am not being sarcastic. Watch and you will see..."
5,"Shop Smart, Shop Amazon for Army of Darkness","This is quintessential Bruce Campbell, the most under-rated actor of our time. This is a man's mans movie. A movie that can be quoted over and over again. Also check out Bubba Hotep!"
4,"Awesome, beautifully deranged!","This has got to be one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Excellent lines, bizzarre action, and Bruce Campbell returning as Ash, what more could you ask for? Also check out the Evil Dead 1 and 2. The second is the best of the three."
3,Fun Stuff!,"If you want a serious scare this movie is not for you, but the bizarre humor and gore are a real hoot. Just for fun with friends. Almost as good as Evil Dead II."
5,Ico / Shadow of the Colossus,"Fantastic bundle! This company produces fantastic games the are visually stunning as well as telling a wonderful story. These were great games before, but with enhanced graphics, the games got even better! Highly recommended!"
4,Ok,Product came on time. It was a little beat up on the outside but inside was good. Thanks for the classic.
4,these movies get better and better,"WOW! What a great movie. I wish I saw this wonderful flick on the big screen. When I first saw it, I needed to see it again. Although this movie is not at all as gory as the first one, it still is a fun movie to watch. I love the fact that the director made Bruce Campbell act by himself. This shows a lot of Campbell's talent as a stand alone actor. If you want some middle-aged fun, watch this movie(especially the part when Bruce fights the three little bruces). I give Sam Raimi a pat on the back for this movie and hope to God that they make more."
3,Very good finish to the dead trilogy,"Army of Darkness is a fine finish to a series of films that started with the classic movie The Evil Dead in 1982. The film has horror, action and one liners. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi have made another great film."
2,No HD Makeover??? Looks 10% better than DVD!,"I can only say I am happy I rented it first! This grainy, washed-out, scratch and pop infested theatrical version is the same cheap copy that hit DVD 10 years ago. It's no improvement over the standard DVD! Not only that, but with HD a theatrical / directors cut could have been on one disk, restored with ear-splitting sound. NOT HEAR!DO NOT BUY.WAIT UNTIL THEY RESTORE IT!"
2,No Commentary Track on Screwhead Edition,"I can't believe they chose the Screwhead Edition for the Blu-ray release of this movie! This edition HAS NO COMMENTARY TRACK. It's the original theatrical version (which I prefer), but there are hardly any extras. What good is it? Love the movie, but love the filmmakers talking about it more. Have to get the DVD version --Bruce Campbell vs. Army Of Darkness - The Director's Cut (Official Bootleg Edition)-- to get the commentary."
5,Klaatu Barada Nikto!,"This is the best movie ever made! I watched this movie many times, and it had so many awsome lines that make the movie hilarious. Bruce Campbell is an awsome actor, and this movie is such a cool movie, I recomend this to everyone."
5,Boom! Boom! Out Go The Lights!...,"I never thought that Sam Raimi could possibly do anything crazier than EVIL DEAD 2. I was wrong. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the perfect horror-comedy, w/ an unleashed and unhinged Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. AOD is an overdose of non-stop hilarity and insane slapstick. Campbell has never matched his wild performance here. Almost every line he utters is quotable! His feel for physical comedy is sublime. Watch as Ash takes one flogging after another, battling demons, zombie doppelgangers, and a skeleton army! If you like a bit of madness in your horror, you can't do any better than this classic..."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie has to be one of my favorites! Although it is suppose to be a scarry movie, it is more of a comedy than a horror filim. There are those jump through your skin moments in it, but many more laugh till your sides hurt moments. See if you can remember ""to say those words correctly."" Great fun for teens and adults alike. I wouldn't recommend younger kids viewing this as they might find it scarry, but for anyone over the age of 12-13, it should be ok. I watched it with my 12 year old son who was howling with laughter through most of it."
2,Good Movie--Bad DVD,"I must agree with some of the previous reviewers. This is a good movie, but the quality of this DVD is VERY POOR!!! The final battle scene is grainy (worse than on a VHS tape) and the dubbing is bad. The words don't match the actions of the actors mouth during the final battle scene in some areas. I guess I'm going to have to buy the other (THX) version of this movie. I hate watching a movie when I am not satisified with the quality of the product. It distracts me from enjoying the movie."
5,"""Hail to the King Baby"" (Boomstick Edition)","Just when you thought it was safe, good old Anchor Bay DVD has released yet again, another edition of ARMY OF DARKNESS. Many would say ""what are you people thinking?!"" while I would say ""bring it on!"" ARMY OF DARKNESS has got to be one of my favorite films of all time and I cant wait to get this new edition! For all you newcomers to the series, this a perfect edition to buy because it has practically every special feature possible! It includes both the theatrical and director's cut versions which I have been waiting for since forever! I'm not going to get into the plot because I dont want to spoil anything for all you newcomers out there! To sum it up, this is an awesome movie full of laughs, scares, ultra cheap special effects and best of all Bruce ""Dont call me Ash"" Campbell! Catch ya later!"
3,TOOOO DARK FOR THE ARMY..,"ARMY OF DARKNESS, IS BY FAR A CULT CLASSIC. BUT IT'S WAY TO DARK FOR DVD. THE MOVIE ALONE IS AWESOME,BUT THE QUALITY OF THE FILM IS WAY TO POOR IN SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE. I RECOMMEND THE REGULAR VERSION OF THIS FILM. THE SOUND IS GOOD, BUT IT SHOUDL'VE BEEN MORE FOR DVD. IT SHOULD OF HAD THX, OR DTS ATTACHED TO IT. I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS MOVIE, BUT NOW I THINK I'LL TRADE IT IN FOR THE BASIC VERSION. ALL THE EXTRA'S WITH THE DVD, LIKE THE ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE AND ALTERNATE ENDING IS A VERY GOOD ADDITION TO THIS TITLE. IT'S NO, ""MATRIX OR INDEPENDENCE DAY AS FAR AS SOUND GOES. I CAN SEE WHY THEY CUT ALL THE FOOTAGE OUT, IT WASN'T NEEDED AS FAR I CAN SEE. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED,..RENT IT FIRST AND THEN YOU DECIDE IF IT'S WORTH IT. IF YOU EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO GET THE BASIC VERSION OF..ARMY OF DARKNESS. THANK YOU...."
5,The Raimi Bros. & Bruce Campbell Do It Again!!!,"Abondaning his horror background for an all out Three Stooges-slapstick-camparoma Raimi delivers one the the funniest films I've ever seen. Halarious one-liners, goofy instead of scary demons, intentionally cheesy effects, Raimi's trademark direction and the ever campy Bruce Campbell make this a great 2nd sequel. Once again the recap of the previous entry contradicts the original ending but there is a case to be made of that. If you can look for the special edition (only released in Japan and Austrlia so it's HARD to find) which includes some new footage and the UK ending as an after credits bonus. Evil Dead 4: Flesh and Blood is rumored to be in the making. Please let it be true!!!!"
1,The ultimate version of AOD,"This two-disc limited edition, featuring the director's cut, audio commentary, a couple of excellent extra features and the original theatrical version as well, is the version of the movie to get. Too bad it's out of print. I prefer the DC, as so many hilarious moments were cut from the theatrical release, and it makes a lot more sense.Highly recommended, if you can find one at a reasonable price, get it, and avoid the crappy Universal blu-ray and other barebones DVDs."
1,A Very Weak Sequel,"This film lacks both the ferocious intensity and insane creativity of the first two Evil Dead films. The special effects are embarrasingly bad, the plot is dull and weak and the acting is atrocious. A prime example of what happens when a major studio takes a good idea and tries to overly commercialize it. Stick with Evil Dead 1 & 2."
1,Overrated trash.,How on Earth can anyone like this garbage? It makes sense how our society of kids enjoy trash like this. Bruce Campbell couldn't act his way outta a paper bag. SKIP THIS ONE!
1,special effects??? this movie was a let down,"I had to turn this one off the effects were so poor. No ED2 here. The Army Of Darkness Attack on the castle reminded me of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers""."
1,Absolute Garbage,With a title like Army of Darkness you would think this would be a cool movie but you couldn't be more wrong. This is supposed to be one of those its so bad its good movies but it fails at being entertaining in any sort of way. Bruce Cambell and Sam Raimi deserve to be shot dead for making this film.
2,Great movie bad HD Disc,Army of Darkness is a great film but this the worst HD disc I own. The film doesn't look very good in HD at all. It is very grainy. The sound is decent at best and there are NO extras on the disc. It's not worth your time and money at this point. If it ever drops in price maybe but right now I reccomend you purchase the two disc Boomstick DVD edition if you want this film.
2,Beware the Bootleg edition!,I love Army of Darkness. I Grew up on it. Its a classic movie but the print on the bootleg edition is horrible at times. During the whole end fight scene you cant see a thing. Why they released it like it was taped off someones old Beta version is beyond me. Some scenes are crystal clear while others you need to stand 2 inches away from the t.v. to see anything. trust me its worth the extra 4 bucks for the original version i just learned the hard way.
3,Avoid the Horrible Director's Cut of this movie,"Army of Darkness is one of my favorite movies of all time! The movie effectively does horror/comedy because Bruce Campbell has incredible talent for physical humor.Army of Darkness is a 5 star movie.Fans of 'Army of Darkness' might want to check out 'Bride of Chucky.' Like Army of Darkness, that sequel stands outside its predecessors and delivers a good mix of black comedy.But this DVD sucks.(1) The GREAT original ending ""Hail to the king baby!"" is replaced by a LAME sequil begging ending for what might have become ""Evil dead 4 -- Evil Dead in Space"" This is NOT what we want to see. Moreover, there is no option to see the movie with the theathrical ending, or even to view the ending in a 'deleted scenes.'(2) The DVD transfer is bad, and is noticably bad whenever scenes not from the theatrical version are included.(3) Some of the extras (storyboards) are really nice though.Buy the Regular edition and stay away from this one."
3,Get regular DVD!,"The only reason to get this over the standard DVD is for the deleted scenes. The quality is simply not Blu-Ray quality, perhaps because of when the original film was made. But the extras don't justify the Blu-Ray price and YES we have both."
2,"Great movie, crappy DVD","Well if you are trying to buy AOD on DVD, you probably wanna know more about the features and quailty, not if its a good movie or not. Well, sadly the DVD quality is really bad in some parts, I mean like they took a camcorder into a theatre and bootlegged it. And other parts of the movie are just fine in picture quality. Sound is okay in this version, I wish I had picked up the THX remastered version they had avaible for a short time. As far as the alternate ending goes, I think it's not as good as the theatrical release's ending. So all in all I would wait for a better edition to come out, this one kinda sucks. Doesn't matter though, any real fan of this movie will buy to see Ash use the really effective back-breaker on a skeleton warrior"
2,Poor Picture Quality,"The only redeeming aspect of this disc is the inclusion of the alternate ending which works much better than the theatrical version. As for picture quality, it stinks. I've never seen a DVD with such poor quality. The colors are muted and deteriorate throughout the course of the film. During the final battle at the castle, the picture completely loses coherence and is bathed in blackness. My VHS copy of the film has much better picture quality. I assumed that the disc I purchased was defective, so I returned it for another copy just to see the exact same piss-poor quality on the new one. Army of Darkness is a great film, but this disc does not do it justice. I suggest buying a different version."
3,"OK, but...something's missing","Watching the SciFi Channel's presentation of Army of Darkness spurred me to yet again pull out my ""Boomstick Ed."" copy and compare it.Sure enough, the SciFi version (as with the one running on sister network USA for years) contains many scenes missing from both the theatrical and director's cuts, e.g. the Ash-Arthur fight at the beginning. In general, this cable version contains all the ""deleted scenes"" available separately on the director's cut DVD...EXCEPT that they are integrated seamlessly in the main film, and the picture quality is consistent/flawless - much unlike the director's edition!When I bought ""Boomstick,"" I was hoping this cable version was the one I was getting. Now I've finally confirmed this is not the case. My next question: anyone know if the cable version was ever released on DVD? That's the one to shoot for.Buyer beware with ""Boomstick."" You'd be better off to get the regular edition & tape the other one off SciFi."
4,Most entertaining undead movie ever,"I don't know about the specific special release or bonus packages for this movie (so maybe I should be careful how I rate this), but the movie itself is top notch. Unless you're a hardcore afficonado, I'd recommend buying one copy of this movie and leaving it at that."
5,B movie classic.,"The movie that made Bruce Campbell famous. Everything a B-movie should be- gory, campy, funny, and not afraid to poke fun at itself. Cool little special effects for the time."
5,OK,"Hilarious! This is one of the best movies to watch around Halloween. No problems with shipping, it arrived very quickly."
2,Decent Flick Ruined By Poor Transfer,"I have been a fan of the Evil Dead Trilogy for a few years now and when I heard the director's cut was coming out for Army of Darkness I made sure to pick it up. Most of the time the transfer of the video is great, but whenever it shifts to the new bits added, the video quality becomes nothing short of horrible. That really pulls me out of the movie and that knocks 2 stars off the scoreIt really is a shame they didn't take the extra effort to remaster the new scenes added in. Hopefully the new ""boomstick"" edition due out in March will feature a vastly improved transfer, that would be reason enough for me to buy it."
3,"Love the darkness, just not this version","I made the mistake of thinking that a bootleg edition of Army of Darkness would only improve on a great thing. However, much to my dismay, it only made me want to watch the regular edition. The movie is great, to those of us who have a sense of humor, but I recommend a pass on this edition and move towards the classic."
3,Strange Sequel,"When this film was released, I found that it strayed so far from the original story that it was almost distracting. Still, there was something compelling about it and I find myself returning for repeated viewings every now and then. The humour is over the top and best enjoyed while under the influence a couple of drinks. Bruce Campbell is fantastic and the effects are cheesy enough for some good laughs. Non stop action! Put yourself in the right frame of mind and there is fun to be had!"
3,.,"Highly entertaining and lukewarm by turns, with more emphasis on comedy than in either of its predecessors. Has a different, more adventurous feel to it, since the entire film isn't confined to a log cabin (like its predecessors), but it's a bit clumsy and hokey on the whole. It's supposed to be sort of hokey, of course, but I mean beyond that. Certain bits just come off as silly in a bad way. Overall though, it is certainly entertaining, and if you liked Evil Dead 1 and 2, you will probably enjoy it."
1,Very Very Unhappy,"I love the film, and there ends the theatrical review. This DVD Video is the worst quality I have ever seen. Entire Sections of film exhibit a ""filtered"" like quality with a purple banding on the right of the screen; the effect seems linked to the stop motion elements of the film. Colours are muggy and the overall intensity of the film renders it very difficult to see what is going on.This is a severely distracting and irritating making the film unwatchable. On the other hand the parts without the stop motion are perfect with high colour definition and deep blacks. How could a DVD with such diametric qualities make it through to the End Users. THE VHS VERSION IS FAR SUPERIOR.PS - A supposed special edition and it doesn't even include both endings....who made this DVD again. I'll make a point never to buy there products again."
2,Evil Dead?!? I Don't Think So....,"Evil Dead fans all hailed this the best film of the series...WHY?!? I loved Evil Dead, and the sequel was just as amazing. So, I wait for the third installment. Video stores where I live don't have movies like this, so I pre-ordered it from Amazon and waited. Once the DVD arrived, I wished I could've shipped it back! I failed to find the obnoxious humor that every other fan knew and loved. The film wasn't scary, more of a comedy -- and a bad one at that! Bruce Campbell reprises his role from Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn -- and director Sam Raimi returns to direct this piece of $h!T -- what a joke! Film is terrible, in short, if you loved Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 because of the gory fun and (sometimes) funny plot, then avoid this like the plague!"
3,The best one-liners ever!,"Look past the cheesy effects, look past the over-acting, and you will find the best one-liners in any horror flick! Not the kind of film you'd watch for the plot or content, but entertaining nonetheless."
5,The best of the Evil Dead Trilogy!,"Army of Darkness was a fun, action-packed movie with laughs, scares, and action. Bruce Campbell protrays his roll again as Ash to stop the dead again in this third movie. For all of you who don't know, this movie had two other movies before this, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn. After stopping the terror in the cabin in the woods, he is sucked back in time in 1300 A.D. with is chainsaw-hand, bullets, and shotgun he sees knights and kings and a hot looking medieval babe. Every thinks he is after fighting with demons from the pit and surviving, everyone thinks he is the chosen one from the Necronomicon. That's when he finds out he has to do some more fighting and I can't blame him, he get a little pissed off and the Necronomicon is the only thing that will take him back to his own time. Then it's a kick ass horror movie. I reccomend this to anyone who is a beginner of horror movies or is just a horror movie maniac. END"
5,Will Quench Your Thirst for Horror!,"Wonderfully funny and scary. Full of action. Bruce Campbell plays it straight in hilarious situations better than anyone. His ability to utter great one-liners while still maintaining a straight face is unmatched. Having grown up on the classic horror films of the '80s (Nighmare on Elm St., Halloween, etc;) I must say that this was one of the best I've seen in years. A refreshing mix of blood and comedy, violence and horror. Too bad it's the last one in the series. I highly recommend this movie to horror/action mavens. END"
3,should include Director's Cut,"This is a review on the Blu Ray edition of this. 5 stars for the movie and the remastering, the picture looks alot better than all previous editions (which are many) 3 stars for the content. There are barely any extras, no audio commentary, deleted scenes and no directors cut (which is shameful since they can fit so much more content on blu ray discs. This edition is good enough until they release this yet again with the directors cut, whenever that may be."
2,Kiss My Boomstick,If you don't have anything good to say don't saying anything at... well you know the rest.
4,"Terrible, absolutly terrible !!!","One of the worst movies I had ever seen, but somehow I loved it. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment, I give it 4 stars but I have no idea why.At least I got some good lines from the movie that I use in everyday life such as ""Gimme some sugar baby"" and ""Hail to the king baby""."
2,I Know What I Am Talking About!,"Okay, first of all this movie is not terrible, but not worth a 4 and a half star rating! While yes it is original, and weird, it is still very boring, and not entertaining. Worth seeing once."
3,"Good movie, but director's cut was edited","Was disappointed that both disks were edited to remove some of the nudity. Enjoyed the movie anyway, but did not like the alternate ending that was originally planned. I think the ending that was actually released with the movie was funnier."
4,Missing a line,"I have loved this movied since the first time I seen it, from Ash's one liners to...well the one liners are just so great. So that is why it pulls my heart that in the Director's cut of this movie they take out my favorite one liner. ""Good...Bad...I'm the guy with the gun."" Now what's with that. Besides that the set is beyond belief."
3,pretty cool,"Okay, the graphics on the skeletons were sh** house and half of the skeletons you could tell were actually men in costumes. Over here in Australia the movie was actually rated M 15+ and isn't very scary at all. The humour in the movie was very funny and a lot of pun was used."
2,Funny uh oh,"Picks up where the second left off. Campbell is transported back through time with his chainsaw to the days of black knights and the landscape just happens to be crawling with dead people. He is tasked by the village people to save them against the evil which he excepts on the basis of being sent home directly after. A nice recovery over part 2 is smothered in immature jokes that will have the kiddies laughing their butts off. Not really designed for an R rating, this is plenty safe for children. In fact, one could argue that this was entirely made for children. Older generations won't get much of a kick out of this."
1,VHS Widescreen is Edited,"The VHS Widescreen version of this movie is edited from the original movie. There's all kinds of nips and tucks throughout the movie, the ""little Ash'es"" scene was cut in half, for instance. AoD is a great movie, but don't buy the VHS Widescreen version if you want to see all of it. I have no idea whether the other VHS and DVD releases are butchered similarly."
1,"Great movie, but the ""Director's Cut"" is a waste of money","I watched this entire DVD in utter disbelief of how washed-out and grainy the video quality was in comparison to the ""original"" DVD release. The five deleted scenes included on this DVD look worse than the Zapruder film, and it's a shame... a few of them would have been worthwhile additions to the movie. While it was nice to finally see the ""Rip van Winkle"" alternate ending, the ""S-Mart"" ending is not included anywhere on the DVD. For any Evil Dead/Bruce Campbell fan, this DVD is a severe disappointment."
5,Ultimate Bruce Campbell Action,"The last of the trilogy and some argue the best. There was a big name behind it and more of a budget to play with then the first two. Hilarious one liners and animation. A must see for all cheesy horror fans and comedy fans. Bruce Campbell is....well, Bruce Campbell."
5,Greatest. Movie. Ever.,"Do yourself a favor and pick this up. It's better if you've seen ""Evil Dead 2,"" but ""Army of Darkness"" is just as good if you've never seen it. And when I say ""good,"" I mean ""epically terrible, but still sooooooo good."""
5,Army of Darkness,This is one of my favorite movies by Mr. Campbell. It is very similar to quite a few SiFi/Horror flicks of the early and mid sixties. It is hard to describe the fun parts of this movie without going into details and giving some of the good bits away. It is funny only in that special way Mr. Campbell has of making something dark laughable. If you are a fan of his work you will not be disappointed with this one.
4,"funny, funny movie.","i loved this movie very, very much. it made me laugh while scaring me. i reccomend this movie to everyone."
3,Diplomatic Baggage,"This set has 3 episodes. 1. ""Diplomatic Baggage"" which is very good.2. ""The ties that bind"" which is also very good.3.""In god we trust"" This episode is so, so bad. Kavanagh goes to the states to help fight a case. According to this writer the US is still totally bigoted - he is about 200years out of date. It must have come as a surprise to anyone who believes this garbage when a black president was elected. It's pathetically Anti US.I feel embarrassed for the writer and everyone else that helped produce it."
4,Trees,"When I want to learn more about nature, life, or any other item of interest I start with a juvenile or young adult book. Trees are explained in such detail in this book it will make a firm foundation for moving on to adult level books about trees."
5,Cordless Clippers,"Bought this product as a replacement for a set of Conair cordless clippers that I used for 9 years - they finally died. I wear a high/tight and cut my own hair at least once a week. These clippers are a bit different than the older version: they are louder but also more powerful and seem to hold a charge much better. They are very sharp and cut very close at the lowest blade setting. I absolutely recommend these for anyone who wears a military style cut, especially if you do it yourself."
3,plastic case broken and missing pieces,"clearly the item title says 22 pieces, but I only received 19 pieces with 1 hair clip, 1 neck brush, and one comb missing. Although the missing pieces won't affect my use of the clipper, it's still not a good purchasing experience."
4,Excellent read for anyone interested in the BPP,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Black Panther Party. Comrade Brown's memior is well written and very interesting.The main problem I have with this book is that I feel Elaine's narrative is biased and self serving. (Especially her commentary on Bobby Seale.)Furthermore, I can't help but to wonder if some of her sexual adventure chronicled in this book are overblown."
4,The Power of the Panthers,"Intelligently written and inspiring!! The truth about the black panthers is revealed in this book. Enter Elaine Brown, Smart, intelligent, witty, and truthful. A member of the black panther party exposed and subjected to the sexism, chauvinism, and often sinister side of the party. Elaine Brown has endured the harsh realities of living in a time of revolution. In their search for social and economic change, the party insisted on doing things on their own terms by setting up programs, fighting against oppression, police brutality, and racial discrimination. However, there was a darker side to the panthers only few knew, and in this book Elaine tells it all. The sex, drugs, and divisiveness of the panthers is only the beginning of what eventually caused the destruction of the party. A long but powerful look into the nation's most powerful revolutionary group."
5,Excellent.,"Its when reading a book like this that you wonder about the other women who history has forgotten, but who played a pivitol role in getting to where we are today. Although I stumbled on this book by accident, it was certainly a profound experience in reading it. Those who claim some sort of moral superiority over Brown, do so with the risk of looking ignorant. Brown never claimed to be an unflawed leader - she is human, with all her fallacies, and that makes both her and the story of the Panthers a raw and powerful one, that ultimately rings true. Its important to understand the good and bad of the struggle that was (and is) the struggle for equal rights. Brown's touching autobiography gives as a very human and insightful look at an important woman during an important time."
1,You Won't Find the Truth in This Book,If you want the truth about the Panthers and Elaine Brown you won't find it here. Ask her about Betty Van Patter and all the cops who bit the dust from Panther bullets. It's nice to see someone who cared so much for the people as a true marxist score a big pay day. Same as it ever was.
1,Wish I could rate it lower,"A despicable person - Brown's ""road"" to the top is littered with corpses, unanswered questions and deceit. A true hero for the ages and a new low for America - it appears that you can do just about anything and as long as you embrace the left and feminist agendas, your position as a voice to be listened to is secure. Any critics are written off as racist or anti-women. This book and Brown's success are truly disgusting."
2,so/so,i agree with the reviewer that said she slept her way to the top.though she was a part of the group she comes across more like madonna than Angela Davis.talking about all of the celebs that gave up the money for the party.it doesn't break any ground at all.
1,Self and Self-Serving,"Everyone has a story to tell but it should be open and objective. Elaine Brown tells us what a strong black woman she is and in the next breath it's 'oh poor me'. In the end, everyone was wrong, except her.If you really want to read this book, bborrow it or skim through in the bookstore. Don't waste your money, enough of us already have."
4,Great journalism tool,"News Reporting and Writing is an excellent tool for aspiring journalists. It is very easy to read and right on the money, as far as content. It covers everything from writing a catchy lead for your stories to a step-by-step process for interviewing. The book also has sidebars that emphasize the important elements in each chapter. I would recommend this book to not only anyone interested in journalism, but to anyone interested in learning how to write better."
1,Horrible,This company sent me the wrong textbook in the mail. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. They aren't selling what they say they are.
3,My first Atwood,"Not necessarily my last, though I was confused by her oft times distracted and unclear writing style. I'd get to the end of a short only to be left wondering, ""huh?"""
4,Dancing Words,"Having read Atwood's many excellent novels, I searched for additional works by her. This compilation of early short stories reveals an author testing the literary waters, without plunging in head first. We see early glimpses of Atwood's dark wit and terse descriptions. And we are also treated to many varied and memorable characters, stories and settings. For those of you who believe, as I do, that Atwood is one of the most accomplished authors writing today, these stories, even though not perfect and early in her career, are far more rewarding than most works by mature authors. A must read."
4,Wu Dang - Beautiful transfer - NO SUBTITLES,"The video transfer here is 1.66:1 so it just about fills the 4:3 screen with only slight letter boxed bars at top.I owned the VHS version for years and hoped to replace it. The image transfer is pristine, and for those of us who are die-hard Wu Dang fans a must have...despite the one major serious flaw:While the menu itself is all in english, there NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES (or any other subtitles for that matter - not even chinese characters!)I'm debating whether to return it as it cost $15 from Amazon. But, the dialog is crystal clear (both the pcm 2.0 track and the 5.1 DD track). So, even with my limited mandarin, I can make out most of the sentences.But if you speak no mandarin, and ""watching"" a movie without understanding what's going on is not your thing, you'll want to skip this version direct from China."
2,I WANTED to like this movie,"I bought this DVD with high hopes; it boasted an impressive cast and appeared to have high production values. Unfortunately, the director seems to lack any concept of comedic timing. Every plot element is derivative. For example--gosh, not only do we have to deal with being gay, but we've got these cultural differences to overcome! The majority of the cast delivered their lines as if the story was as uninspired as it is.I was willing to forgive so much to enjoy this film. Unfortunately, the terrible comedic pacing and predictable plot made this impossible. The director seemed to know that conflict drives the plot. However, conflict without viewer tension is ineffective. Maybe I have seen too many movies, but there was never a time when I did not know what was going to happen or how the conflict would be resolved. Good cast, mediocre script, terrible direction."
1,..only because 0 stars isn't an option,"This movie was cheesy and poorly done. I found myself laughing at the sad parts and rolling my eyes at the ""funny"" parts.The main character was completely unconvincing and her acting seemed forced, at best.In between ""dramatic"" scenes, I was forced to watch the lead character have lengthy pensive moments on her motorcycle, which reduced a friend of mine and me to utter hysterics.As if that weren't bad enough, the lead character's sister ended up taking a pensive ride by the movie's end.The movie was also predictable...within 5 minutes, I knew it would blow. This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm sorry to say, she is no longer my friend. Maybe my review will help save other friendships from a similar fate. ;-)"
3,Important Question,"Ok, I've read all the reviews here and I'm still left with a huge question about this movie: Does Jill Hennessey (the most gorgeous of all the ""Law & Order"" babe assistant DA's) get naked or what?"
1,Terrible movie in every way!,"How is a lesbian of color in New York City going to have close to no friends of color?! This movie is way too white-washed to be believable. It just re-enforces myths that gays and lesbians of color are just honorary white people. When there are great works out there like ""Fire"" and ""Tongues Untied"", this movie was garbage to me. I am a worse-off person for ever having seen it."
4,Nice way to spend an evening,"If you want to spend a romantic evening with your partner, this movie is a good choice.....sweet and with a good ending."
2,"good movie, awful DVD",This is a good movie but the sound mix on the DVD is appaling! When music play in the 'background' you can't hear the dialog anymore! This spoilt it for me.
2,Poor Nero Surrounded By Amateurs,"I feel so bad for Franco Nero. He is such a talented actor and , as always, he is good in this movie. The story is good also, but the real problem is everything else. The other ""actors"" (with the exception of Steven Bauer) are absolutely pathetic. I've seen better acting on an episode of 'Cops'. The direction is far below sub-standard. Ed Wood would laugh at this. For fans of Nero and bad movies only."
4,Not into voo doo but it still kept my attention!!!!,"This book was very good,didn't think I would enjoy it but it kept my attention. The hooker, the cop, the crackhead it was just wild, especially when the crackhead died at the kitchen table and could see his body laying there. How he was dead and his soul still wanted a hit off the pipe. Then how he sold his soul to the devil just to come back so he can hit the pipe. Man this book was something. You got to read it!"
3,cute,"I thought the movie was pretty cute, though annoying at times because of the girl, but good enough to watch."
1,Did not work out of the box,"Bought this phone based on Consumer Reports. However, when trying to set it up, whenever I plugged it in, an extremely loud buzzing sound came out. Adjusting the speaker volume had no effect. Evidently some kind of short circuit in the product. Poor quality control. Now need to go through a cumbersome return process (I was installing it more than 30 days after buying it)."
1,Too High,"I bought this item and found it much too high. Most chairs are 16-18"" high and a transfer bench should be chair height. Other transfer benches can go this low. Looking at the manufacturer's website, I find that this item can be adjusted to 20.5-25.5 inches high. Since the legs that go into the tub need to be shorter than those that go outside the tub, the transfer bench will be perhaps 22 inches off the floor when the bench is level. For many people, their legs will be hanging at this height or they will be sitting on the edge of the bench weight resting on their wet slippery feet. It's ridiculous that the supplier hasn't warned potential customers that this item is unusually large.In all other respects, this transfer bench seems perfect fine. SInce safety is the main reason for buying this product, I gave it one star."
3,Didn't work for me,"The chair itself is fine except that the height cannot be adjusted low enough for our needs. Also, it is almost impossible to prevent water on the bathroom floor when using the chair. Therefore, it was useless for me."
4,very good,"i saw it the first time expecting it to be a type of comical ""napoleon dynamite"" movie. that is where it didnt quite cut it for me. so i saw it a second time focussing on puberty and relationships, that is where it excels. i wanted more from the mother and the movie in general, but it was just right to get the points across."
4,Pretty Good Shirt,"I ordered the got eli? shirt, and it was pretty nice, but i got the wrong color writing, but I still liked it anyway. The shirt is pretty nice, but I don't think it's worth $20, I think the price should be a little lower."
4,Great fundamental works but care needed...,"This book offers a great detail in building the basis for multi-echelon and mult-indenture spare inventory models, and the most importantly - the key ideas behind every mathematical equation and model assumption. The author also put a lot of emphasis on the efficient implementation of the models, which is particularly useful for the practitioners.However, the readers should be very careful with the errors in this book, especially those in the formulas and exercises..."
4,Fun for learning how to cook japanese,Just moved to Japan and with this book we are able to save money while cooking our favorites at home. And we have learned so much about different foods we have not yet tried.
1,Doesn't work right out of the box.,"Ordered one new from B&H.; In the 1x mode the top light came on, no worries.Turned on the bottom setting of the switch, 2x, nothing. Neither light came on.Pitiful. Sending it back."
2,The Sony HVL-20DW2 video light,"I recently purchased a Sony #HVL-20DW2 video light. My first time using the light, with a Sony NP-F570 Li-ion battery, only the top bulb will burn. If I attach a higher capacity battery (NP-F730H or NP-F970) both upper and lower bulbs will burn. All three batteries are 7.2V. ??????????Also, the light sits too high above the lens to illuminate subjects closer than 5 feet when mounted on my Sony VX 2100 camcorder. I found it necessary to remove the light from the camcorder mount and hold it at a lower level while shooting close subjects. Some sort of vertical adjustment or tilt would greatly improve the light."
1,Light is great - bundle is not,I've only had the light for a day and I quickly snapped on the battery and it looks like a great light. BUT my review is for the bundle... don't do it!!a) The recommended NPF970 is gigantic!! As big as the light. It works and probably lasts a long time but it's really heavy and seems like overkill.b) The recommended battery charger DOES NOT fit the NPF970 battery. Such a hassle.You'll either have to return the battery or the charger so I recommend just getting everything individually. The NPF570 seems like it would be fine with this light.
4,good old rock and roll,I liked this group back in the day and still do.This CD has all their original music and a lot of covers that they do real good.If you remember them this is the CD to get.
4,Finally she is moving away from purely biographical stories,"I love the world that Anne Rice has created. But I had to admit I have been a little disapointed with her last few books. Many of them read like biographies more then stories. I longed for the tales of Lestat where he was unafraid to use his power and we could all revel in his abilities with him. She has finally come back to that. Blood and Gold is hardly action packed, but it does feature a vampire who is accostumed to flexing his muscle form time to time. This is the story of Marius that picks up after where we last saw him in ""Pandora."" This story covers centuries and fills in the blanks that we left in this intriguing character.I am glad the Anne finally focused on the vampire and not the biography and history. Thank you Anne."
5,Very Happy,"I was very pleased with the condition of the book, and the speedy delivery in which it arrived."
1,Why????,Another pointless and tired retelling of a story that has been told in four separate novels. Badly slapped together with a horrible wrap around story that seems to be constructed by a 5 year old. Don't waste your time. Maybe the next Vampire Chronicle will actually advance the series or at least have something new to say.
2,Anne must have needed easy cash,"If you've already read the Vampire Armand, this book will bore you to tears. There are very few new ideas here.Save your book-buying dollars for writers with integrity."
4,Whew!,"After hearing about the HORRIBLE job made on Queen of the Damned (though I blame whoever made the adaptation and not necessarily the acting... although....) I wanted to find Anne Rice and give her a good slap in the face. This book has redeemed the two heartbreakingly bad pieces of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicals (Vittorio and Merrick) and even was a step up from The Vampire Armand, which I did enjoy. The history was excellent and I did like how she incorporated the relationship between himself and Mael. However I did not see the point of killing Santino via Thorne and what was Thorne about anyway, really?"
1,Same story badly told,"I don't know what to do with book. Throw it out or use it to hold open a door. I am a HUGE Anne fan, but this was pure shlock. I hated it, the whole thing. I don't know what she was thinking when the words, ""cloud gift"" found their way onto her screen. Usually Anne Rice can make the unbelievable believable. She can take her readers on journeys of thousands of years and miles and we are right there with her, shaking with joy and anticipation. And then, there was Blood and Gold. Ugh. If you are looking for a great Anne book, try Cry to Heaven. It's pure magic."
3,wordy and inconclusive,"if you are an avid Rice reader, you will probably read this book out of sheer patronage; however, overall this book is mostly wordy and inconclusive.the most captivating part of this novel is the usage of words and how things are described, because if you have read any other vampire chronicle books, most of what you read you will already know (save for some very small personal details about marius's tormented life). nothing is really new here with this work and you get the same vague sense of accomplishment from say Violin, but nothing like Memnoch, Armand, or Merrick which i would say are vastly better.the ending leaves a hollow vibrating rhythm of confusion and seems relatable to the ending of the latest Lord of the Rings movie in that the book just isn't done."
2,Appalled,"I purchased this book despite serious misgivings, having been discouraged by the quality of the author's recent endeavors. As with most of her books, it starts out very slowly and one must persevere to get at the real meat of the story. The middle of the book was quite entertaining if a bit erratic. *Loose ends, inconsistancies, out of character behavior, etc.* But the real horror was the ending. For about the last forty pages, the book takes on an air of complete incomprehension. I read with disbelief the completely illogical and totally unbelievable ending. It was as though the author had turned it over to a ghost writer who had absolutely no knowledge of the characters and arbitrarily decided to shock us. Well, she did. I for one, will purchase no more books by Ms Rice."
3,GOOD,"Interesting...you do not have to read any of the other books to follow this story....still trying to understand the ending...no new secrets revealed, but leaves possiblity of other vampire characters still in exsistance."
4,A Chronicle worth the read,Anne Rice once again creates a world not seen in our everyday lives so wonderfully that we are transported and siting by the fire listening to the tale being told. It is one of the Vampire Chronicles but could be read as a stand alone. It is the story of a vampire but also the story of a man who has seen a world die and another take it's place. How this shapes him and his own struggle to over come his shortfalls.
4,Worth It!,"I didn't actually go out to but this book, but I got it for a VERY low clearance price. It was actually the first Anne Rice book that I have read, though I have seen a few of the movies. I am told that her earlier works are better, so I guess I should take a few steps back.It's a good read. She has an ability to make such ""undead"" characters ""come to life."" I felt for the lead character and pictured things through his eyes.Although possibly not her best, it's worth buying."
2,A partial return to form for Anne Rice,"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne Rice's first few Vampire Chronicles but began to lose interest as she moved away from epic romance and character development in favor of overly detailed descriptions of the mating habits of the undead. For me, Blood and Gold, featuring the ancient Roman vampire Marius telling his own story, was a partial return to form. Marius, a familiar and appealing character, relates tales of love and heartbreak and the rise and fall of civilizations. He also relates the stories of many of the vampires he meets throughout the years, and all this once-removed storytelling takes its toll. The dialogue, laden with capitalized vampiric catch-phrases, is horribly stilted, and the distant as-told-to quality of the narrative deprives the reader of Rice's usual lush, sensuous immediacy. Until Rice comes up with some new ideas I'll sit out the next few installments of the series."
3,What can I say about Anne Rice?,"I simply believe that Anne Rice is an excellent author. However, her newest novel, Blood and Gold was a bit of a dissapointment. It basically described a weak, always-complaining 2,000 year old vampire; a ""child of the millenia."" As in most of her novels, she vividly describes environments with such detail. I think, however, that the ending of this book was rather lame. But I guess that all of Rice's fans should read her for the sake of enjoying what she has to offer. I know that she will go down as one of the best authors this and last century!"
2,Where is Lestat?,"I can't tell you how anxious I was to read Anne Rice's newest book. Although I am interested in the lives of each vampire, something is missing. That being Lestat, and the old Anne Rice we love and adore. The excitment is missing. We need the Brat Prince back in all his glory and adventure. Although I forced myself to read this book, some parts were good, on the whole it was boring. I refuse to give up on Anne Rice, and look foward to the next book with much enthusiasm, but I pray it is the Anne Rice of old."
1,horrendous,"Am I alone or does anyone else think Anne Rice has a problem remembering what her earlier characters have done? I remember that at the end of 'Armand' Marius and Santino are friends, walking around NY together. Yet here, Marius wants Santino dead for centuries-old offenses. What gives?"
2,Predictable Rice,"I was once a huge Anne Rice fan. Her early novels, particularly Interview With the Vampire, were interesting and fresh takes on the vampire legend. With Blood and Gold, however, it seems that Anne Rice is not merely beating a dead horse, but flogging it mercilessly into pulp. The prose is miserable and distracts from the story, and the story itself barely differs from the last few installments of the Vampire Chronicles. The dialogue is horrible enough that you can't even imagine it coming out of the mouth of a centuries old vampire.This book is only worth buying if you're an Anne Rice completist. Even then, I'm waiting for it to turn up in remainder bins."
1,Chronicle fans Beware,"If you are a fan of the vampire chronicles, I would suggest that you steer clear. I Feel that Anne rice just put this out for cash. Boo. Ever heard of bowing out gracefully?"
5,great book!,"This was a great book. A suggestion, make it a winter read so that you have plenty of time to sit and enjoy."
2,i couldn't pick it up...,"I loved every one of this series, but this one made me yawn, i have owned this book for years and STILL haven't finished it. not riveting at all..."
2,disappointed,"I have read every Anne Rice book ever written, including ""Belinda"", ""Tale of Sleeping Beauty"" series, and ""East of Eden"". I typically like her characters and the situations that they encounter. However this changed when I read ""Blood and Gold"". I got tired of Marius's incessent wining and complaining. After reading her other books I kind of thought of him as a god/father figure for all of the other vampire children that could help them in their times of trouble. But when I read this book I realized that Marius has almost as many issues as Lestat. However unlike Lestat he doesnt seem to have the courage to do anything meaningful about them. This book changed my perseception of Marius, but not all Anne Rice books. I suggest you read ""Blackwood Manor""(the main character is magnificent!) instead of ""Blood and Gold""."
2,"Nothing new, and lacking in creativity.","I have read all the Vampire Chronicles and 95% of the book's story has already been told in the past books. Anne Rice uses her ""succesful"" formula again, but it is starting to get real old. I for one I'm tired of gay vampires, and tired of reading the same story over and over again. Some parts of the book are well written, even addictive, but most of the book retells the same stories, already told, and lacks creativity."
3,OK book,"This latest chronicle tells the story of Marius. Its very informative and well written, as are all of Anne Rice's books. The book starts off kinda slow, and only towards the last half of the book, becomes interesting. I was dissapointed in that there was not really that much in the book with Armand and none at all with Lestat or Louis. Yet, you do learn things in this book that you might have wondered from reading the other chronicles, which i found interesting. And as always, i recommend this book, along with any other Anne Rice novel."
3,No news in the vampire`s night,"Blood and Gold is the biography of one of the most mentioned and known character in the Vampires' Chronicles, Marius.For those who have read the previous chapters, this works as a summary of the whole saga, few new characters and facts. And as a summary, it can even be enjoyable.However, for those people who don`t know what comes before, my advice would be to abstain. They might get lost and overwhelmed by facts and characters they are not familiar with. It seems to be a recycling of the author`s previous books without the splendor and novelty they provided. One might even think it was written by a different author, since it lacks the sensuality and poetry we were used to feel and enjoy in Anne Rice`s writings."
4,Anne Rice at her Best,"Let me start off by saying that if Marius was a real person, I would be stalking him. I love him. I love everything about him.Blood and Gold follows the life of Marius the vampire from ancient Rome (you can't go wrong here) through today. The descriptions and details are mind-blowing. Each century he describes is alive with details. One of the few books that actually ignites all of your senses.Marius is one of the most fascinating (and co-dependent) characters I have ever encountered. Every emotion in this book comes to life - his feelings of love, loneliness and desparation. I honestly have to say that this is the best Anne Rice book yet."
3,After Merrick this was a disappointment,Really enjoyed Merrick but thought this was ok but did ramble abit and did not really draw you in. I expected something different after Merrick. Perhaps Lestat going to war with the Talesmanca. But it was not to be.
3,what happened?,"to the wonderful vampire books i loved? now anne rice just appears to be rehashing old material again and again, if you want a great book by a Rice, check out her son Christopher."
1,Vampire's aren't the only one's that suck!!!,"Please do not waste your time or money on this book. Anne Rice needs to spend more time writing 'engaging' fiction and less time getting ideas from from her poet/artist husband. Jesus! What's worse than gay, pedophile Vampires? Queen of the Damned was the last one worth it's salt. Maybe Anne should become a poet-artist like her husband.Bring back the Mummy 'cause she doesn't seem to have any new ideas for the vamps."
1,still dont have it!,"it's been a month and i still dont have the book! how long is this going to take? it's rediculous! i doubt i can even get a refund because the book was practically free, i just paid for shipping. i feel as though i've waisted my time, money and effort with this purchase. im frustrated and i WILL NOT use this seller again. when i contacted them for information they could not give it to me. they just said they would see if the book was returned, but thats the last i heard. if im not going to reciceive my book i'd just like to know so i can go to barnes and noble and buy it. but i can't do that until i hear from the seller thats theres no use in waiting. i forsee myself going out and buying the book and then coming home to see it's been delivered. but frankly i dont think they have to wits to tell me that im not going to get it, so im just going to piss and moan and wait. theres not much else i can do."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Blood and Gold is an example of another book of the Vampire Chronicles series that is of around the same quality as The Vampire Armand.Instead of Armand though, this is Marius' story, and Armand is of course part of this. However, the major focus is his discovery of a vapire, his turning, and his eventual custodianship of the two ancient statue-like vampire elders, and the problems this causes."
3,BUT.....,"Didn""t her husband, Stan, recently die....could this be a factor in the slump in her writingI just finished Blackwood Farm and it's sequal Blood Canticle and they are back up to her old standard.We are all human.. some more than others maybe"
2,Sheer Disappointment,"I've been an Anne Rice fan for over 20 years. I have enjoyed all of her books except this one. Blood and Gold is a huge disappointment. I kept thinking that I had heard this story before...and I had. Just pick up a copy of The Vampire Armand and the majority of Blood and Gold has been harvested from those pages. It seems that Anne needs to take a break from the VC and recharge her batteries. There is nothing more annoying than spending money on something that you pretty much already have. I feel like I've got two books telling the same story (Armand, Blood and Gold).Blood and Gold does introduce some new material about Marius, but getting to it is a tedious endeavor. I would not recommend this book. Read the Vampire Armand or the Queen of the Damned instead. If you must read this book, save your money and go to your local library and borrow it!"
2,about blood and gold,"Marius had always been my favorite character in the vampire chronocles. The wise roman, the optimist, and the true immortal who can adapt with any era.This book however ruined him for me ... he is an immortal whining, complaining about his experience in immortal life. This is so unlike the image I had of Marius in the previous books.However once you get past that ""woe to me"" theme ... Anne Rice continues to tell a good story. This book is a whole lot better than ""the vampire armand (which i believe is the worst of the vampire chronicles)"" but still not up to Rice's usual standard."
2,Should have been called tarnished and rusty,"Anne Rice's style of writing is tedious and boringly repetitive. The characters, although described with an abundance of verbiage, are shallow, vain and conceited. Reading this novel was like wading through mollasses just to get to an ending that was a real let-down!"
2,Getting Lazy,I was looking foward to Anne Rices new novel. Maybe my expectation was too much but I wanted alot of questions answered from previous novels and I wanted to read more about Marius's mortal and immortal life. But everything in the book was uninteresting and boring expect the vampire Bianca. And I also thought Armand the love of Marius now its Pandora! It seems that Marius falls in love to easily with everything thats beautiful around him and it seems like he still wants to be a mortal man. The only reason he keeps Akasha and the king to himself is because it gives him a purpose in his immortal life. I dont know I expected more from Anne and this novel just seemed so lazy.
3,Fair to middlin,"This is better than so many of these have been....It is still the whiny - life as a vampires is so hard - and here I am with no helmet - type of stuff...But as least this tale is spun against a fairly interesting backdrop.Some if was seemed a bit like either an excuse to yammer about the times, or maybe the writer wanted to brag on some obscure points she picked up somewhere, either way, it got tedious, as most of the vampire chronicles has for me, but this on was probly so far the 2nd best in the series. If you are a hit and miss reader of this series, read this one, its worth it."
1,What the...?,"I thought this author hated fan fiction. I mean, on her web site she forbade her fans from writing any more of it back in 2000.And yet, skimming through this book, I saw scene after scene, dialog thread after dialog thread, that seemed to have been plucked directly from some of the (much better written) fan fiction I've encountered over the years. Take the scene in which Marius and Thorne go out to the local watering hole and meet up with three ladies, for instance. I read that same scene in a piece of fan fic fully two years before this book was released. The fan's scene involved different characters, but otherwise it was nearly verbatim.Then again, maybe that was the real reason she demanded all fan fiction be removed from the Internets.Outside of that rather intriguing item, this book was a crashing bore."
5,Highly recommended,A must for anyone who fishes for money/grant for research. Great asset and provides immense help and support for developing grant writing skill
4,Urban Chaos,"As usual it is hard to find a good shooter for you sega system but right now URBAN CHAOS is the best. The control,to me is tighter than any of the other Dreamcast games and if you like games such as Medal Of Honer,the thrill of a kill will please you. Not a whole lot of role playing elements but lots of violence. The blood shots could be better and the shots from far away make moving targets harder, but until HALF-Life come out this is the game..."
4,Broken Saddle,"This small book tells the story of a poor boy who get a chance to own a very beautiful hourse. He loves it and it loves him as well. The boy begins the journey by riding the hourse without any apparatus. But one day, he wants to enter the hourse-riding competition. He tries to use the saddle and that changes the whole thing overly.This is a beautiful story for children. The most impressive part is the end. For me, it likes ""Stand by me"". The boy lost something which might be very important, but he discovers the self and be matureRead this book"
5,Great Speakers Awesome Overpowered Surrounds.,I bought these speakers for Surrounds in my new home theater system. I actually think these speakers are not used enough being surrounds for the wonderful sound that comes out of them. If I was setting up another home theater system I would use these for my front left rights and surrounds especially at the amazon price I paid of $75. The only negative of these speakers is they are not made for wall mounting.
3,"Great, affordable surround sound.","I have listened and researched much audio equipment before I decided to buy these and I am impressed with these JBL's. They are only 2 way speakers but as rear surround speakers these will help develope the depth of surround sound that you are looking for. As front speakers, I would personally not use them. I am looking into JBL's 3 way - 6 inch drivers for the front speakers. All in All these are spectacular for the price, they look good, and are well built."
5,Great Small Speaker with Bigger Sound than Expected,"First, I should say that I am big fan of JBL speakers. I have a set of 135 surround speakers that I bought a few years ago and I still use the small surrounds as my rear surround speakers as well as the subwoofer.Anyway, I bought these to replace an in-wall speaker that I have from Cambridge Soundworks. (We put a bookshelf in rendering my in-wall speaker useless). I am very impressed by the construction & sound of this speaker. It is solid feeling, very nicely designed and sounds great."
2,Disappointing,"JBL Venue Series Monitor 5-Inch 2-Way Speakers (Pair)I have owned many JBL speakers for over 30 years. This one fell well short of my expectations. The bass needs to be tightened, the highs sound too metallic.Not suitable for music listening, maybe good for TV watching."
3,great,the straw got ruined though my hubby put it in the dishwasher:(we use this a loti think 20 dollars is a loti do love that i can make her a plate with variety though
5,"Who says ""it's for the birds"" is a negative expression?","This blend is for the birds and exceptionally so. Cardinals, finches, tufted titmice(titmouses?..I'll have to look up the plural), nut hatches, all the usual suspects quickly empty the feeder and anxiously wait for it to be refilled. It's so good in fact, that some mornings I dress up in a giant red cardinal suit and join in. I will be ordering more soon."

2,MANN OH MANN ... AND LADIES TOO,"William J. Mann, P'town native, novelist and biographer has a new book out, the small, slight and compact, Gay Pride: A Celebration of All Things Gay and Lesbian (Citadel Press, $15.95). From the Ancient Greeks to Will and Grace, Mann writes short breezy pieces about 101 reasons to celebrate the rich heritage and vast cultural contributions of the gay and lesbian community. Some pieces are breezy and funny, others more considered and moving. There are no real surprises here, just interesting takes on the various aspects of gay and lesbian people, places and things. Think Camp for the curious."
4,A relic of the Cold War,"I enjoyed this book a great deal and was fascinated by it as well. The Cold War seems so far away now, and this book captures the feel of the vague, aimless, crumbling, exhausting Eastern bloc so well. It's not a frivolous book at all, but is still quite funny in the same way that Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut were. I just wish I understood all the cultural references. ..."
2,A Minor Apocalypse,We read this for bookclub. I did not care for it. Reading about someone being talked into setting oneself on fire just does not do it for me.
3,Software Nightmare,"I recently purchased the HP 9110 All-in-one machine. It works great...NOW. I spent about 10 hours on the phone with HP support before we finally got the software installed correctly. If you don't have networking, multiple printers, and can use a USB cable, you probably won't have any problems, but if you need to use a parallel, think twice!! Now that it is working, the print speed is awesome (for an inkjet) and the two-sided printing feature is very cool. All in all, I'm happy with it now, but a few days ago, I would have had a very different opinion!!!"
3,Not for Vista or Windows 7,I had this printer for quite a while. I recently update two computers to Windows 7 and now I can't use the HP9120 for anything besides simple printing.
2,Cheap construction - Scanning sucks!,"For a multi-machine this thing seems cheaply constructed appearing to have that cheesy plastic, flimsy build. I made a BIG mistake moving from an HP Scanjet 8250 to the 9110. I crank up all the scan settings to scan NCR order forms, and all this does is produce a 400MB file that looks pixelated, light, and crappy. The scanjet 8250, using the same settings produces a beautiful copy at a reasonable file size. I usually do not have to make many modifications in the lighting to make the carbon copies readable....Though the 9110 is obviously NOT primarily a scanner, I did not think that with technology 'now-a-days', that the results would be so much further below the par of ANOTHER HP product!"
5,DUH!!! Come on people!,"Check out ""cloudnin""s essay of 1/3/03. Can we say someone has too much time on their hands?Anyway, for those who gave this movie a good review based only on entertainment (aliens, suspense, etc.), that is cool, but you'll still be missing out. This movie is not about that, but about fate and seeing how even though life can really seem like it ... at times, things really do happen for a reason. This movie is a must see."
5,Top Movie......,"Signs is an incredible movie with a superstar cast in it. It not only keeps you on the edge of ur seat but also makes u laugh along the way, people always have this idea in their head that every scary movie needs to have blood and bodies being ripped apart. This movie does not have those qualites, and that is why is it such a great movie. It is suspenceful and thrilling and you are left only wanting to see more.For those folks who say this movie is terrible or bad, i say they know nothing about a good scary movie cuz the only thing they are looking for is blood, dead bodies and violence. For those folks i recommend watching aliens or terminator.Signs is a great movie, full of surprises and thrilling scenes, even the moments of silence is incredible in this movie.Im glad for a change the ending is simple and not a dumb ending like in the movie ""unbreakable"".This movie takes the meaning ""scary movie"" in a whole new dimension. It is if not the best one of the best movie of 2002."
3,Not for everyone!,"This movies does a spectacular job of keeping its audience in suspense. It's hitckockian in this way and I believe it rivels its precessors (the 6th Sense and Unbreakable), however the movie's script and plot can leave the diligent viewer unsatisfied. It is obvious the film-maker is hoping for complete and willing suspension of disbelief because once one begins to question the plausibility of events it is very easy to pick the story apart. For viewers interested in a thrilling movie this is for you.The actors are great especially the little girl (it's worth watching just to see her steal each scene). For viewers interested in gaining insight into what might actually happen if we were indeed attacked by Aliens you'd be better off watching something else."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Do you enjoy feeling manipulated? This silly, pretentious, contrived, ultimately meaningless movie jerks you around for 106 minutes, stringing you along with one ""teaser"" episode after another, and finally ends on empty. It's a well-acted, well-photographed, well-directed waste of time, energy, and resources. Save your money."
4,The best and I've seen in the past 4 years,"I loved it. Plus the movie theater I went to is low priced. The reason why I'm going to buy it is because of the fact that it was so good. People in my town though thought it was a little too scary and when my friend saw it she wouldn't drive alone past corn fields. This was and is a great movie and for anybody who saw ""The Ring"" this is even better"
3,"re-titled: ""Inconceivable""","Ok, there were 2 moments in this movie were I did actually jump or flinch. So, it was effective in that way. I liked the characters and I did feel sadness for their loss.However, there are definitely problems with this story.... as everyone else has noted. Let me add these:1) This movie is so politically correct. Why does this farmer or anyone else not have a friggin' gun? It reminds me of Scott Evil, character in Austin Powers movies,--- take a gun and just shoot him! Get it over with!2) How can aliens that travelled millions of miles to us be confounded by wooden doors or boarded up windows?3) There is a hella-lot of water on our planet, dumb aliens! Obviously you saw it up from your spaceships. Don't come here.I will say this: our 10-year old has been interested in seeing a scary movie and so we thought this would be a first one to see. Even the child saw problems with the movie, so it was good that it did generate some critical thought."
1,worst movie I've seen in years,"Overly contrived screenplay with horific acting make this movie unwatchable. At times it is ammusig in a sort of Mystery Science Theater sort of way ('did they actually just say that'), but not funny enough to get you through."
4,Give It A Break!,"Whatever happened to the good ol' days when we could watch movies and not nit-pick them to death? Ooh, scary bumps and eerie music. Remeber this is a B-Movie homage. Rent/Buy Signs and have a good time. Everyone just calm down and watch this movie with not too hard of a plot to follow, go to bed and think someone's standing on your roof. Let's hope there's actually no one out there."
2,Scooby Doo meets the Aliens,"After all the hype I finally went to see this hoping to be entertained by a great movie. Signs is the same corny rubbish that Hollywood churns out every year. It's not scary, It's not interesting and the outcome is just ridiculous. However I did enjoy the shots of the the cornfields."
4,I'M HOOKED!,My first time ordering on Amazon. VERY PLEASED. Came in the mail quickly. I'm HOOKED. Will be back to order more DVD's.
1,How is it scary?,I went and saw this in the theater and I didn't find it scary. The first time I saw the trailers I thought it looked scary but when I saw the alien the movie just sucked bad. I mean okay if you people enjoyed the movie than that's cool but in my opinion I just didn't like the movie much. It did have good acting and a good storyline but the movie just wasn't scary.
2,So- So,"the movie started out great and continued to be so for the next 45 minutes to an hour. I was very intirgued and absorbed. But then everything changed. I understand it wasnt a horror movie and was simply supposed to be about the 'signs' of an invasion, not actually about the invasion. But after awhile it stopped being suspensful and just became very dry and boring. And the ending left MUCH to be desired. It had its good moments, but Im glad I only rented it instead of buying. It just wasnt that noteworthy."
1,simply awful,"Save the $4.00 rental fee. This movie is terrible. Even Mel Gibson, a fine actor, can't save this turkey."
3,"more aliens, less backstory please","for all the sci-fi hype, this story was rather unfulfilling. the back story of the family ""tragedy"" really doesn't belong, as it makes the movie muddle along for long periods of time.it is worth it to at least rent and watch for the aliens, as those scenes are some of the most frightening i have seen in a while. and your vcr/dvd player has a fast forward button, which will be nice. trust me."
5,Scary!!!,"This is the 2nd scariest movie of the year. The scariest being The Ring. This is definately worth a look. I suggest seeing this movie. It'll scare you, shock you, and thrill you. It's got a pretty simple plot, so that means it's one that anyone can enjoy. Contrary to what some reviewers said, there are no enormous plot holes. This is good, so buy it now!"
2,"Very disapponting, funny in a way...",...This movie is somewhat funny cuz you can tell the aliens are fake and another funny thing is they said it was the best alien/movie of 2002! I'm sorry for this review but its definately not that great of a movie like everyone says. If you wanna scary movie try The Ring or better yet They cuz this movie is just plain awful. I only gave it 2 stars on the account of Mel Gibson being in the movie or else this movie...would suck even more!
2,Was I supposed to be scared?,"Because I wasnt. This is not a scary movie. It's pretty annoying and stupid. The characters wear foil on their heads. After watching this and Unbreakable, I'm starting to think Shyamalan has lost his touch. Next time I'll be more cautious."
2,Cure for Insomnia...,Here we go again. Another snoozer from the most overrated film maker of the last decade. Three strikes and you're out. After watching his first two stink bombs I was being very fair in giving his third a chance and yaaawwwwnn..... is about all I can say. I literally fell asleep. The only reason I give this two stars is the darling performance of Abigail Breslin.
5,Every minute suspensful...reminds me of Hitchcock Movies,"I really loved this movie. For one, I find the subject of crop circles fascinating. Two, It was a great cast. Mel Gibson was great as a widowed father and reverend who has lost his way. Joaquin Phoenix was really funny, as was Culkin. It reminded me a lot of Alfred Hitchcock movies, particularly ""The Birds"". It didn't involve a lot of special effects or different environments....just the fear and eerieness of basically being a sitting duck...not knowing if it was the end of the world, not knowing how to defend yourself as it has never happened before, not knowing exactly what is out there. You are trapped in your house just waiting. It was scary, suspenseful and somehow managed to also include a person finding a lost faith. It also leaves you with things to think about when you walk out of the theater. I will buy this DVD and I recommend this movie as a good choice to go see."
5,The Best So Far of 2002,"Signs, starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Pheonix, is a phenomenal thriller that will get your heart pounding. The dialogue, direction and acting are smart- this film has a definite shot at some Oscar acting nominations. M. Night Shyamalan has made up for the the horrible Unbreakable with this original and creative film. Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, and farmer who gave up his faith and reverendhood when his wife died a few months before. Joaquin Pheonix is his brother- both men delive high caliber performances, just as Graham's children do. The plot is based crop circles that appear in fields rapidly around the globe- one right in Graham's corn field. It's thought to be a hoax until ships appear in the night sky above hundreds of major cities. Then aliens are discovered near Graham's house, and he and his family try to devise a plan to keep out the deadly invaders. With a great ending and numerous shocks, Signs is great, definitely worth seeing, perhaps more than once.MY GRADE: A-"
4,A terrific thriller with more than just suspense,"OK, lets get the bad out of the way first: there ARE some gaping plot holes when it comes to the aliens and their weaknesses. But it doesn't matter, and that's why I love this film.The real story arc here isn't the aliens and what happens to them. It's how those events help to heal a family and to restore one man's lost belief in everything he held dear. High marks to Shymalan for using an alien invasion framework to give us a film with characters that grow and people you really care about.Yes it has tons of suspense, atmosphere, humor and shocks, but it also has a heart -- something rare in this genre. And it's exremely well put together in terms of pacing, construction, acting and creative use of sound.Sure, when it's over you might wonder why the aliens didn't just pack a few raincoats, but you'll also be touched by a moving character story set in the middle of a great roller-coaster ride.Great movie!"
1,Mind Numbing,"Perhaps I watched a different movie than the vast majority of reviewers here. The ""Signs"" I struggled through, was nothing short of pure rubbish.Here's the story: Once upon a time there was a faithless preacher, who lived on a farm with his children and brother. One day, aliens invaded their planet, so they stood around talking a good bit--though they never really said anything--, wore aluminum foil hats, and eventually hid out in the basement until the invaders just up and left. One alien was left behind, so the preacher's brother hit it a few times with a baseball bat and splashed water on it. The preacher regained his faith. The end.Ten minutes into the movie I was hoping that the aliens would hurry up and kill off the entire family, but alas that never happens. Instead viewers are treated to an hour and half of dull, uninspired acting, and virtually no action. Honestly, this movie makes ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"" look good."
2,I hate alien movies.,"I'm the biggest chicken when it comes to alien movies. So far the only ones not to give me at least one nightmare was Mars Attacks and Independence Dat, cause they were just stupid.The family in the corn fields wake up one night to find a monstrous crop circle in their fields. Soon spooky, unexplainable things happen, and lights begin to hover over cities that are less than a mile away from a crop circle.And then the scariest part for me happens. It's a news reel in which an alien just walks past suddenly and I admit, it scared me really bad, cause I know that somewhere in the universe there's aliens, cause really, the universe is just so big!If I wasn't scared by it I would have given it higher, but I just was.IT was still good though, I only hate it because it's scary, you know what I mean?"
2,Vastly overrated,"This movie was so hyped up last summer, with people saying it was the scariest movie they've seen in a long time. After seeing this, I determined that most people are very easily frightened. I was not scared by a single scene in this film. I thought that the plot was weak, the acting bland, and the ending unbelievable. People are also declaring that M Night Shymalan is ""the new Spielberg"". Please. Spielberg has more talent in his pinky finger than Shymalan has in his whole body! I see Night as some guy who just got really lucky with a decent first flick and is now churning out hopeless...""Sixth Sense"" retreads. Give me something new to watch, buddy. I already saw your first movie twice, and now you're asking me to watch something almost exactly like it (only with aliens this time)? You've got one more chance to prove yourself to me Mr. Shymalan. I am not amused."
1,cant get any worse,"all this hype and it turned out to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Absolute crap, the acting is terrible. Everyone in the movie is depressed. The actore all overreact. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME"
1,"If doorknobs stump you, you might like this movie","Not being a religious person myself, I didn't even realize that the movie was supposed to have a subplot about redemption. All I witnessed was a really bad sci-fi plot. Other reviewers have revealed how the invading aliens could be easily defeated with squirt guns and spit wads, so I don't need to go into that. They've also described the scene where one of these highly intelligent creatures is trapped in a pantry: the door was not locked, but was secured by nailing boards across the door frame after the alien was inside. I haven't read all 1199 reviews, but of those I've read nobody has mentioned that the door opened into the pantry (if my memory serves me well). Therefore, the only thing keeping the alien in the pantry was that he couldn't figure out how a doorknob worked. If you're one who prizes ""street smarts"" over ""book learnin'"", then you might appreciate the movie more than I did. That was the only subliminal message I got."
2,Very disappointing!...,"I had high hopes for this movie, but when I saw it, I was very disappointed. I loved The 6th Sense, and I expected this one to be great too. However, there were so many holes in the plot, it wasn't worth watching. It seemed to me like they ran out of script about half way through the movie and just made up a stupid ending. I mean, if the aliens can come to attack our planet, how come they can't open doors? And why would they just randomly decide to leave? Good cast, ok acting, but no story!..."
1,signs is awful,Awful! I was sooo disappointed. An alien in the pantry and then the hero saves everyone by beating up the alien with a baseball bat? The End. This movie sucked.
3,Very entertaining and clever in spots,"Yes, the major complaint with this film is the whole ""aliens-water"" thing. That would be a valid complaint if the film was about an alien invasion, that was just a plot device used to explore the motivations behind Mel's character and themes about the power of faith. It succeeds on that level while providing some real suspense and excitement.Signs is not as clever as ""The Sixth Sense"" but it is well worth a look."
4,Pretty creepy and interesting movie.,"This is a creepy and interesting movie. The alien portryal and story line is a bit cliche though. I was expecting a little more creativity. The mood, perspective, and directing is awesome though. Overall, pretty creepy."
3,signs a good movie and a bad one,"Signs was a movie that was exciting and also scary in some parts. Mel Gibson was the main actor of this movie who played a role that was very well played and very depressing. The aliens however were very human like in some ways as of appearance, but also different in there speed and strength which was beyond our own. The movies rating was probably more like a PG rather than a Pg-13. It seems that it was just rated pg-13 because of some intense parts and only a couple of profanity words. There was no blood and no real people that were dieing throughout the movie that were shown. Other than a few down parts this was one of the best movies of its time."
3,An Ok Sign for Signs,"This movie was Ok, the actors did a good job in protraying their characters. The downfall of this movie is that they got into the action right away, but didn't show you anything until the end of the movie. I waited how many hours for that?! Half the time you want to see what happens, but they don't show you anything!!"
4,Great,"Not many young directors are as talented with the camera as M. Night Shymalan. This is his third major studio movie and also his best. Signs does not deal as much with crop circles as much as how one family deals with crop circles. This may sound confusing, but this film is built on such a genuinely simple concept that the viewer does not have to think too hard.Graham Hess is a former priest who lost his faith when his wife was killed in a tragic accident. His family is slowly growing apart and to add to the tension, an enormous crop circle appears on his land. Terrifying events start occurring throughout the world and Graham's awkward structure of a family begins to fall apart.This movie has enough frights, but these frights are strictly limited to what the viewer cannot see rather than lighting up the screen with dazzling amount of special effects. I loved Signs for its simplicity because that is truly the only way to convey a message."
2,"Signs, not all it could have been","This movie had so much potential but like the directors other two films ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" it failed to please. the acting is good, and Joaquin is amazing as he is in all of his movies, even Mel Gibson impressed me. There is some cunning dialoge and some funny bits throw in at just the scariest moments, making them even funnier, though you do feel bad for laughing sometimes. But the way the film was hyped up i was expecting so much more, i will not spoil anything, but M. Night really needs to work on writing much more fulfilling stories that at the last minute do not disspoint. Out of his trilogy of films i would have to say ""unbreakable"" is my favorite, a great movie haltered only but a fake and easy ending, much like signs."
2,In my view,"I try and give every film a fair objective look. Signs was not about ailens, invasions, family, or us against them. It was about religion in todays modern world. Are what we see signs of proof or just a desire to believe. This movie proved that we all can miss the obvious and let or superstition get the best of us. If you go and see this movie you will be asking yourself some very important questions. Are we alone, is there a purpose to our existance, does everything happen for a reason, why is it that an advanced ailen race can design a space ship but can not open a pantry door? Acting was basic at best, plot was not well thought out. It is worth the cost of a video rental but the cost of going to the movies to see it was too much."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED ...SLOWWWWWW,Well ...color this one ...for me at least ...WAR OF THE WORLDS IN COLOR .....thinking it was going to be an intelligent look at crop circles I was nearly put to sleeeeep by the slowwwwwness of this movie ..and very disappointed .....the Alien was from the X File Movie ..which I loved .. get your OWN ALIEN sir ...:) movie didn't make sense ...Didn't take CROP CIRCLES very seriously and I think we should ...Two friends went with me and they felt the same way ....
5,Very Very Freaky,"I loved this movie...it is literally gut wrenching...I felt like I was in the movie...I mean fearing for my life...Definately had that War of the Worlds vibe to the point of absolute realism. Absolutely brilliant directing and acting..M. Night has a slow pace to all his movies...but it's called suspence...I was dozing in the beginning but excatly half way throught I was straight up in my chair for the rest of the flick...my stomach is still turning from worry and stress just watching it. Just like Sixth Sense, you are just freaked out! You'll walk out of the theater spinning. Awesome Movie!!!!!"
2,Long&Drawn out&Re-cycled,nothing new under the sun&especially here with this film which has already been done far better many years ago&with other better overall story-telling.this film is ok but spends too much trying to fill in lost Gaps with un-needed fear tactics that just don't work.Mel Gibson is alright here but gets stale after a hour.
3,SIGNS: A GOOD BUILDUP; ALAS A CONFUSING END,"I love any movie with Mel Gibson in it. I feel that he brings an emotional range to even the worst films.He did not disappoint in this one.He seems to convey physical fear like no one else.The build up of the plot was intense and creepy.It reminded me of that old flick the last man on earth?.The supporting actors were excellent. Joaquin Phoenix was a great supporting match for Mel in this movie.The children were great especially the little girl.My only beef with the movie was that it was unbelievable.I really enjoyed the ""Sixth Sense"" because the fear was palpable and entirely beleivable.I really wanted to see the Sheriff come save the day or at least die trying. I was a little disappointed in the ""Alien"" but I really liked the nod to the ""Wizard of Oz"" with the water destroying the alien.I really liked it."
1,Better luck next time!,"Sorry Mr. Shyamalan, but after sixth sense it really seems to be a hard work doing a good movie.I took me a very deep breath to get through this boring picture. Thank god the corn signs are made only by human beings."
3,Neither too bad nor too good.,"This is not a completely worthless film (it has good characters; wonderful humor; a cool, if not scary, atmosphere most of the time; and a few startling jump scenes), but it could be better. There are some logical flaws (how is it that Morgan got a book whose author knew everything about the aliens, anyway?), and the drinking water bit is just strange. To make matters worse, it enables the viewer to predict the ending, which is a problem in this genre. It was also a big mistake to show the aliens, if you ask me; it gave the film that B-Movie quality which makes the whole thing, not just the humorous parts, seem hilarious."
5,Love this movie,One of my all time favorite suspense thrillers of all time! A must have for your DVD collection. Check out this director's other movies...all are just as good!
2,Sighs,"Some winning moments, but mostly a fairly predictable yawn. It's at its most effective when it isn't trying to a) be deep, because it ain't! b) be funny, because it rarely is, or c) be unpredictable, because you can see the plot twists a mile away.Still, some pretty scary moments. When the Brazilian kids see the alien, and when the dog runs amok are very effective.It's amazing that so many people find the ending so satisfying and ""deep"". In case you haven't seen this, Mel Gibson's character is a minister who has lost his faith because his wife was killed. But, lo and behold, it was all part of God's plan, because now Junior won't get killed by an alien because he's an asthmatic, because it was a part of God's plan, and Mel's daughter has a strange obsession with water, and, gee, coincidently enough, so do the aliens. And do you know why? Because it was all part of God's plan! This is pop spirituality at its most shallow."
3,Signs,"The suspense in this movie kept building up more and more and then at the end it just dropped. The ending of this movie was so bad! I could write a better one! There were plenty of scary parts in this movie, like the alien sighting shown on the news, the alien leg seen in the corn feild, when the alien grabs the son in the basement, but there was so much dissapointing ...! Like when you see the alien at the end, or even worse how they kill the alien, or how the aliens just decided to leave earth and everything went back to normal. I left the theater so mad.Go see the movie but leave 10 min. before the ending. You'll like the movie a whole lot more."
5,Woah! Signs is a way awesome movie!,"Signs is a great movie. That's it. See it. But since that isn't really long enough to be a good review, I'll write more. Signs was written and directed by M. Night Shymalan who wrote and directed The Sixth Sense, another one of the best movies ever! So if you like The Sixth Sense you should see this, too. Both movies are very, very awesome. Also, the acting was really good (very believable). This movie was also scary, but it didn't gross you out by showing tons of blood and guts. This movie is about (of course) signs appearing in crop fields. Yeah, it gets to be more, but I won't say who or what is causing the signs. See the movie, then you'll know. Or read other reviews. They'll tell you, too! This is a movie that also deals with family relationships, not just the freaky things going on in the world. It is a great movie, I highly reccomend it, so go see it. It's awesome!"
2,Holy Cheese-Wiz!,"Okay, so a vastly superior species comes to invade our planet. But to navigate the globe they need to use--crop circles?! And they're allergic to water--the most abundent element on earth. So what do they wear here? Well, nothing, of course. (How about a raincoat, at least?) Puuuh-lease! Which begs the question: is M. Night a one-hit-wonder? Yup. 'Fraid so."
1,"If you have a ""not to see"" list, this should be at the top","Take several really talented actors, put them in a story with no point, and you have Signs. I can't believe others have rated this movie so highly. I was terribly disappointed, since there was so much hype surrounding the previews. The ending was so poor as to be pitiful and silly, but by the time I finally got there, I was pretty much expecting the worst. If I had not been a captive audience on a long distance flight from Europe, and had already watched everything else available, I would not have sat thru until the end."
1,Suspense Trilogy Going down Hill,"From a surprising ending of the Sixth Sense, which is after all only a somewhat good pastime movie, to the [derivative] style of the Unbreakable, to this movie, Signs, Shyamalan's suspense films are really going down the hill fast.In this movie, the filmmakers are trying hard to create an environment and style imitating those in the great Stanley Kubrick's movies. However, unlike Kubrick, they lack the ability to master the overall suspense and that something, which will, in Spielberg's words, grow on you.The film fails to grasp your attention in an intelligent way. Everything seems staged and manually put there for you to accept. However, not everyone is a sentimental freak as the audience was originally intended!!! This movie is, after all, a boring, ridiculous journey that will lead you to two things, 20 minutes of sleep and the decision of never watching it again."
2,What's the Hype!,"Severely disappointed in this movie on all levels: acting, direction, story-line, the whole ball of wax. It appeared that the film sacrificed greatness by going for the deep psychological study of the characters and placing the story concept of alien invasion on the back burner. Also felt this was the worst acting ever for Mel Gibson. He honestly didn't look like he enjoyed making this film at all. Sorry to be so blunt, but I could barely get through this."
2,War of the World/ID4 wannabe,"This movie is a War of the Worlds and ID4 wannabe. The aliens are hardly there.Most of the movie takes places in Mel Gibson's farmhouse. There is one crop circle in this whole movie. Sure it's hyped and critrics are saying it's one the years best films.Mainstream movies maybe?There is tons of plot holes and dialogue problems, It feels like a made for cable movie. Sure people will be screaming at the parts where you jump. Save your hard earned money and wait for this movie on DVD and video.If you must see it wait until it hits the second run movie theaters!"
3,Good but not great.,"Signs is a messy kind of film. The idea sounds good but the execution and delivery ultimately falls to pieces. The cast is strong, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and adorable Abigail Breslin keep this suspense thriller watchable but this film is not scary in any way. M. Night Shyamalan's films are a hit and miss for me, his storytelling is too predictable and he is a sloppy, confusing writer. This is a film you watch a couple of times but don't expect another home run like The Sixth Sense."
2,Average to Below Average Taken from Cliched 50's Films,"This film is one that has absolutely nothing to add to the sci-fi genre and most people have lauded it as the best thing since mustard. This is a very average film that is boring and predictable and it is absurd in its entirety, not to mention that the director (who is incredulous in the film) can not handle the basic premise of logic. The inconsistent themes which play out are laughble, considering that a whole film is wasted on the pseudo-intellectualizing of a man who has lost his faith and regained it because of an alien invasion (was the script written by a 14 year old). Most of the film takes place on some small farm in Iowa that is attacked by plastic looking aliens which are latter computerized and hillarious. Avoid after first viewing. Grade: C"
3,High Expectations,"Maybe because of the previous projects of this director (6th Sense & Unbreakable) my expectations were too high. This is an OK movie, and Gibson carries everything pretty well. However this has nowhere near the depth of the other movies. A fine rental."
4,Movie makes you think,"Not that this movie makes you think that ""others"" are out there, but it also makes you think about your own faith and the coincidence's that we all have throughout our lives. The movie was very suspensful and had a great ending. I would say that if you want to spend a night watching ""spooky"" movies, I would rent this one."
3,MELS DONE BETTER WORK,"I FOUND THIS MOVIE BORING AND TO LONG.WAR OF THE WORLDS TYPE,WITH NOT ENOUGH WAR OR WORLDS.PERHAPS THE CRITICS WHO RATED THIS 5 STARS WERE AT A DIFFERENT SHOW THAN I WAS?? SAVE YOUR MONEY,IF YOU MUST HAVE IT GO TO RENTAL STORE AND GET IT USED FOR HALF PRICE."
3,Could be better but fell short too much,"Kinda bored and cliched. What? Martians or aliens who is afraid of water? Give me a break. The whole movie is like the house itself surrounded by cornfield, going nowhere, achieving nothing at all. Even without fun, only ridiculed itself gradually... Signs are like a big circle with nothing in it...."
3,"Great film-making,but dull script","I loved THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE and looked forward to another MNS film.SIGNS looked promising,but my feeling after watching it was that it didn't nearly have the creativity of what came before.Fine performances,but dull and predictable plotting make them not as potent as they could have been.Great look,but the script should have been rewritten."
3,Signs or Sighs?,"The begining of the movie was great and it promised more to come but about 1/2 though the movie it did not deliever. Mel Gibson was not at his best and the other actors seem as if they didn't know what expression to put on. It began to drag 3/4 the way though the movie and the end bombed out. If this movie was an attempt to scare you it didn't and the only highlights of the movie was the humor put in now and then that brought a smile. I suggest you rent the movie and if you have a different oppion than mine... buy it, if not only to put another few dollar bill in producers wallet so he can get enought money this time to produce a worth while movie."
3,So-so,"I found the movie a bit annoying. How many farms are there in the United States do not have, SOMEWHERE, a 'varmit' gun? Honestly, very few. How fortunate for the aliens that they just happen to land right at the one farm in the state that doesn't a weapon,save kitchen knives, with which to fight. Is this alien blind luck or what? On the plus side, the acting, particularly the kids, quite good, the suspense enduring, and the story line decent.But. I live in a very small town. I guarentee if we had an alien invasion the homeowned gunfire would be deafening. Unless nuks were required, I'm thinking most US towns could hold their own. Forget small towns - a place like Chicago would kick @ss and take names!Sarcasm aside, not a horrible movie, and if you can get it at a good price, go for it."
4,"Lowered Expectations, Then Enjoyed It","I had the advantage of hearing nothing but bad things about this film before I saw it, so my expectations were low. Often times, I am pleasantly surprised after hearing all those negative remarks. I'd include this as another film ""better than I expected, ""but not good enough to watch a second time.I watched it as a piece of entertainment, nothing else, and appreciated the sharp photography, too. In other words, I didn't read into anything with the story which so many others have seemed to do. Mel Gibson plays Hollywood's favorite type of clergyman: the kind who has lost his faith. That is, until, the strange turn of events at the end of the movie.At least it is an entertaining movie, with good suspense and very little offensive material. This is the typical M. Night Shyamaian movie, which means it does a good job of hooking you into the story but doesn't always give you a satisfying ending."
3,marginally better than unbreakable,"that's all i've got to say. the 3rd worst (wide release) movie that old m. night kharma karma karma chameleon has made. it's ok, but not worth buying, even for $5. rent it from the library."
3,DVD Quality Sucks,"Ok, the story line does get cheesy at points and the plot is a bit lame, but, all in all, it's a good film. Sure, it isn't nearly as good as Sixth Sense, but this isn't because the actors didn't give a first-rate performance. I would give it a ""4"" which, in my book, equates to an average film, but for the fact that the moron who edits the film for production into the DVD did a really poor job. As a result, I'd give it a ""3"". Obviously the studio did not proof the film before releasing the DVD. Look at the scene where they are all at the dinner table and Mel Gibson, before breaking down, gets angry because the others insist on saying grace. Something happens and Mel bolts from the dinning room table, but the shoddy editing shows he bolts and leaves a Superman-like trail of wind behind him. Gimme a break! I've seen $6.99 documentaries with better editing. If you're gonna make a decent movie, don't detract from it with crappy editing."
3,Interesting and odd...,"The real intrigue of this film lies not in the struggle with an alien invasion but in the inner struggle of Mel Gibson's character.Mel has arrived at a state of unbelief and anger with God after the tragic death of his wife. The former priest doubts all the things he once held as true. Anyone who has been disappointed by God can relate to the questions, the loss, and the fear of this lonely, disbelieving father.But when events press him to his knees, when all other recourse is stripped away, he turns to the God who never left him and finds an answer to prayer and the seeds of a renewed faith. For those who walk by faith and not by sight, many have been in similar places to this character. And a piece of ourselves lay broken and wanting until the Father reached into our lives to heal and to mend.This is the moment that redeems an otherwise cheesey film and weak plot."
5,Signs,"This movie will have you laughing one moment---then crying the next. Not to mention, you'll be hanging off the edge of your seat! The dvd has great features for fans of the movie and it's director."
2,"Too me, just not enough entertainment...","I watched this movie a year ago when I bought this DVD, and I like a few other reviewers thought I was going to be watching a good movie. But it turns out I got hardly no goodness of entertainment from this movie. The best part of the movie to me is at the vary end. There were some good parts between the begining and end, but this movie only gets (2)stars because I just never got into it, really I kept wanting to turn it off and just forget it all together, but I was interested in seeing how it ended, being it was the first time watching it, so I kept watching it. Like I said it was an ok movie, but my advice to you is rent it first. And if you like it enough buy the DVD later. But really its not worth adding to your DVD collection..."
3,"Worth watching, however...","Director Shyamalan is a master at building suspense and tension and keeping it interesting. The interest in the whole crop circle thing seems to have subsided a bit but this film really dives right into it and draws the viewer in. It's quite fascinating. I was hooked from the beginning. In terms of theatrics I give it a high five stars.However, without giving the ending away I can't express my disappointment enough. Considering his previous works, I had hoped for more, something different, something unique. Nope.There is a faith element that is ultimately unnecessary with Mel Gibson a priest struggling with his faith. It's hard not to be cynical but it seems a bit forced.Without giving the ending away, it was disappointing, opting, in my opinion, for the easy way out.Five stars for entertainment value, one star for its subseqent plummet into formula, balancing it out at three stars."
5,"Alfred Hitchcock for 2002, suspense and story before effects","M. Night Shyamalan sets himself up for an Alfred Hitchcock comparison from the opening credits - and he does not disappoint. This is the kind of movie Hitchcock himself would be making were he alive today. Like Psycho, which wasn't really about its star actress Janet Leigh, Signs is less about crop circles than audiences expect.The suspense is masterfully handled - diametrically opposed to most other films today - and a welcome relief from their guts and gore. The shots are beautiful, the actors exceptional. The child actors give phenomenal, realistic performances.By always maintaining focus on the characters, and raising serious questions of fate and faith, Signs defies the label of science fiction. Because it shuns so many conventional elements of film (graphic violence, sound bites created solely for trailers, extraneous special effects) Signs is a movie well worth watching again and again."
1,Good for insomnia!,"This movie was very disappointing. I fell asleep twice in the theater. They should have never showed an alien, they should have left it up to the viewers' imaginations. The only scary parts where when you thought you saw something or when you saw a shadow and objects moving in their wake. M. Night has really gone down hill since The Sixth Sense!!!"
4,Good movie,"Very good movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat and at the same time very nice twist at the end"
3,Could have been more,"This movie started off pretty well and kept me interested for a while, but unfortunately, like so many other films, the story starts to unravel to an rather disappointing ending. Definitely rent before you decide to buy."
2,Possibly the most boring film I've seen in the last year,"I don't understand how M. Night gets all this hype. I constantly nodded off during this movie. I haven't enjoyed any of his films except the first one, and that had plot holes big enough to drive a Hummer through."
2,This one lost me...................,"My two favorite movies of all time are Gladiator and Braveheart which lead me to anticipate that this movie would be a winner. Mel Gibson really shined as Sir Whilliam Wallace in Braveheart and Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic as Emperor Commetus in Gladiator. However, in this movie both were rather a disappointment to me. I think alot of it had to do with the fact that the plot of this film was not able to hold my attention. To merge a priest's loss of his calling due to the senseless death of his wife with a visit to earth from aleins who make crop circles in the farm fields of the area just lost me from the beginning. What is the connection? I have read alot of reviews on this movie and what surprised me the most is that virtually no one takes the middle of the road; you either like it alot or not at all. Fans of Mel Gibson should give it a chance like I did and draw your own conclusions."
2,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"This movie was a confused mess that made less and less sense as it went on. Everything was supposed to support the belief in signs and portents and that everything happens for a divine reason, but there are so many huge logical holes that the intended effect was lost. The message I got from this movie is that god wanted Mel Gibson, his children and brother to survive an alien invasion. This meant that even Mel Gibsons wife had to die to deliver some cheesy prophecy with her dying breath so that an alien could be defeated with a baseball bat and some glasses of water. Also, apparently these aliens we smart enough to build space ships that could travel between the stars, but not smart enough to understand a door knob. This was just an awful movie that was only a little watchable because of the stars involved and some of the cinematography."
5,Signs - A Have-to-See,"The newest movie, Signs, was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and had actors Mel Gibson and Joaqiun Pheonix starring in it. M Night also directed The Sixth Sense.Signs opened in theaters Friday, August 2 of 2002.Signs was a great movie. Unlike The Sixth Sense, Signs has no twist, but with a twist it would be worse. Who'd want to see a movie where the crop circles are man made or imagined. Signs is not a movie that the audience can pay a little attention to and still get it. The movie is a thriller that takes imagination. At some points something happens and the audience how to react, I don't want to spoil it. There are some very funny parts in the movie. With this added, and the fact that it's an on-edge movie, Signs is more than worth the money to see.The only twek I found was it ended too quickly.I would suggest Signs to viewers over the age of 13 and over because there are frightening moments and mid cussing. Overall Signs is a have-to-see movie."
5,An AMAZING movie!!!!!,"I dont care what any of you think, but i think this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The Aliens needed to be a bit creepier, but the screenplay, acting, and graphics are all top notch. The movie hops straight into the story, and is not to complicated. There is a small bit of humor which was good, and the tension was great. I would recomend it to all."
2,um next please,"Yea i had a change of thought, at first i was indifferent about this movei, then i liked it, now im like, what was it about really. The aliens seem dumb and weak here, one gets caught in a kitchen pantry by some chicken of a guy, the other one doesnt even put up a fight, i mean come, on, bring on the mean green aliens! boring..id would make it a promise to myself -never to watch this again."
3,"Nothing like ""The Sixth Sense""...","Although I enjoyed the performances of Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix (his humor during the tense parts cracked me up) and those of the child actors, I didn't find this movie nearly as good as the director's predecessor. And while one shouldn't compare two different movies it is difficult not to. Several things didn't make sense to me. Was Mel Gibson a former Catholic priest in the movie? He wore a collar and people called him ""Father"" and wanted to make confessions. However, I didn't think priests could marry and have children? Oh well, just one more confusing part of a much-maligned movie."
2,I Expected More,"I thought this movie was ok. The story was pretty good, but I think that they could have done a better job overall. The whole ideas surrounding the crop circles and the aliens coming down was enjoyable and a good portrayal of what might happen. On the other hand, the side story about the minister who lost his wife, and thus loses his ""faith,"" I thought was really cheesy. Not only has it been done before, but it took away from any credibility this movie otherwise would have had. Decent movie, but disappointing in the long run."
1,"Bad premise, poorly done","I resent having to give this sorry excuse for entertainment even 1 star. Aliens who are killed by water invade Earth - just proves that interstellar spaceflight can be accomplished by idiots. And it gets worse as it painfully drags to a final scene which, as an atheist, I found highly offensive. If a film has a religious adgenda, I wish it was so noted so that those who did not want to be hit over the head with 'crisis of faith/faith conquers' all plots could spend their money elsewhere."
1,Really Bad,"This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen with a major star in the cast. Not that the acting was bad, but the story was just terrible. I bought this DVD because a friend told me it was the scariest movie he had ever seen, his wife actually said that he screamed in the theater three times! I really need to have a talk with that boy and find out what scenes caused him such [a fright], because I get more scared opening my monthly credit card statement. BORING AND PREDICTABLE. More holes in the plot than a ton of Swiss cheese. My 'favorite' scene had to be the one where these aliens who came from millions of light years away get locked in a kitchen pantry with a table chair against the door knob by some [weak person]. These aliens develop space flight, make it to earth with the intention of destroying all mankind, and they can't get out of a farmhouse pantry? Goodluck with your next planet. Not worth the money. ..."
1,DON'T BOTHER WATCHING IT.,"Oh boy, what can I say?!?Maybe we've all grown great expectations when It comes to Mr.Shamalaya.Problem is, his imagination and creative genious is fading out.After the groundbreaking ''The sixth sense'' and the very different and unique ''Unbreakable'', It seems that not even Mel Gibson made this one shine.The plot goes from childish to poor, the acting is nonsense, so is the story.The approach was terribly executed, when you see how dumb and numb the aliens are, you won't belive we are talking about alien superior intelligence, plus, some unecessary violence towards the end..Does It help? Not even a bit, It only made the movie more silly.If you want to spend your hard-earned money on It, be my guess, but don't tell me I didn't warn you."
2,"Dear God, not the squirt gun!!!","Warning: ending revealedThe suspense is thick (I jumped at one point), the characters very well portrayed, and the cinematography lush. Why the poor rating?The film's fatal flaw:The alien invaders are smart enough to develop space travel. Yet when they attack they limit themselves to weapons with a range of about 1 meter and don no armor. In fact they appear to be naked. A bad idea considering their skin has a violent chemical reaction to water, among our planet's most abundant compounds. Come on Shyamalan! You are way better than this!"
3,Good Sci-Fi movie......for the 60's,"I just watched the movie, and for me it looks like a 'good' episode of the old series 'The Outer Limits', the original one.I cannot accept the fact that nobody pulls out a gun against the aliens. Unreal in rural America. The writer does not understand the American way of thinking.That is all I can say."
3,"Loss of primary focus leaves ""Signs"" sighing...","In short, ""signs"" is basically two films in one. The first is about [1] an extraterrestrial invasion, replete with flying saucers, aliens and deadly alien gas. The ""news"" footage of the invasion is interesting and the cinematic work is memorable in the beginning. The second is about a priest [Mel Gibson] and his loss of faith when, God, presumably, allows his wife to be killed in a freak auto accident. During the course of the film, it becomes obvious that the director couldn't decide which story he liked best. Ultimately, the extraterrestrials are relegated to a prop supporting the priests' regained faith as they are quickly dispatched with tap water and a Louisville Slugger [baseball bat]; a metaphor uttered by his wife before dying on the hood of a Suburban. Utterly ridiculous. ...."
2,More Bang 4 The Buck,"First, let me say that I am not one of those blindly hating this movie. I just think that it needed [a little something] more. I expected this movie to be scary and it didn't even come close. I think I laughed out loud on one occassion; Bo tastes the water that she's about to give to the dog and says it's contaminated. Morgan tastes it too and tells her it's simply from the tap and that's why it tastes different. Bo still doesn't want to give it to the dog because of the taste. So Morgan politely reminds her that the dog licks his butt every day and isn't going to mind. I was almost in tears on that part, but the rest of the time I was on the edge of my seat waiting for a truly scary and exciting moment.... and was consistently left feeling let down when I saw what came next.I didn't hate it persay, but after seeing other very good movies from this same director, I simply felt cheated."
5,Good Thriller,"I really enjoyed this movie because of its simplicity. Sure it is not packed with spectacular special effects or anything like that, however, that is what helps make this movie pretty darn good and realistic.Although I am pretty sure Aliens aren't going to invade earth anytime soon, this movie left me wondering, what if?"
5,A great film,Anyone who thinks this movie wasn't scary obviously wasn't intelligent enought to understand it.I think it was another brilliant film by this ingenious director and I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to be on the edge of their seat.
3,Surprisingly Entertaining,"When I first heard of Signs being released in theatres I was completely skeptical of it's premise, the UFO thing seemed overdone. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Shyamalan's Signs. Though it was definitely no Sixth Sense in the scare factor, Signs was entertaining and well directed. I would definitely recommend it for a movie night."
2,SIGNS stupid,"This has got to be one of worst movies ever made. It started sloww & had a nothing middle, and the end was Dumb. anyone want to buy this piese of junk. If not, Anyone for target pratice. I didn't give my name because I don't want my freinds to know I wasted moneyon this trash."
5,DEFINITELY NOT FOR STUPID PEOPLE,"The subject ""DEFINITELY NOT FOR STUPID PEOPLE"" may seem a bit harsh but true in my opinion. This film is a MASTERPIECE. It's incredible what can be accomplished with none of the gore, violence, bad language and sex seen in most of today's movies and even tv shows. It's called CREATIVITY and GREAT story telling. It takes someone who is a GENIOUS, in my book, to make a movie that pushes all the right emotional buttons and makes the viewer react at all the right places. It's VERY frightenning at times but always makes the viewer sit at the edge of their seat. For those who are used to all the junk that's out-there stay clear of this movie. This is a THINKING person's film who can appreciate the complexity and genious of the script. Many times it is the viewer who ""fills in the blanks"" and thus the movie does not attempt to ""force"" anything on you. It's pretty open ended and I like that. Oh, and yeah, the acting's pretty great too!!"
5,Outstanding edge of your seat movie!,"Saw this tonight with my girlfriend and we both thought it was a *very* good movie! The director mixed in a lot of subtle humor with some very scary parts. It left a lot unanswered which just makes you want to see even more! I came home and got online to see if I could find a book on this movie, but it appears there isn't one! Too bad, I really want to know what happened next! If you like scary movies and movies that actually make you think a little bit, GO SEE THIS ONE!"
5,An absolutely great story!,"I found Signs to be an absolutely great story. I don't know much about theology or what ""Reverend"" is supposed to mean or not mean, but the story in this movie was very interesting. The tragic death of a very loved wife and mother is the backdrop. The husband having his world completely torn apart. Now add alot of creepy things going on. They don't make sense. That's the point. Sometimes life just doesn't make sense. The talk between the two brothers about the ""types of people"" was, I believe, the core of the story. Do we believe in miracles or not. What type am I? It was a great story!!!"
3,"Not all ""Signs"" point here...","While ""Signs"" is a motion picture which gets high marks for its dramatic nuances and scope, however, its effect on the ""fright-o-meter"" in many of the ""scary"" scenes leaves a lot to be desired. It would appear director M. Night Shyamalan wasn't given a whole lot of material to work with here, although the semi-all-star cast (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin, to name a few) makes this effort flow through with relative ease in spots. For the most part, nearly all of the ""fright"" sequences lack any substantial punch and are abominable, except for one brief scene, which will make one's stomach cringe with a fairly sizeable degree of agony. Even with some physical and script inconsistencies, Shyamalan did an adequate job in the director's seat. If ""Signs"" had featured a mostly unknown cast, this picture really would have been a frightful disaster at the box office. Still an average flick, all things considered."
2,"Signs, signs everywhere are signs.....","This movie was a disappointment. I heard much hype of how ""thilling"" of a movie it was and scary. Not so in either case. This movie's plot is not plausible. Now, now, the aliens COULD invade, I'm not saying that. I'm saying who in their right minds would decide to stay in an isolated home, miles from anywhere, and ""wait"" for the invasion to happen? Who? I would go for the safety in numbers theory if I were in their shoes. Also, there really is a slight build-up, but the climax is anti-climatic. Mel Gibson stars only to give it a ""big name"". His performance is average."
3,They werent lying when they said this was a B movie.,"However it was still fairly entertaining and had alot more humor than i expected.Pros1.will keep most peoples intrest2.Has some pretty creepy scenes3.pretty suspensful at times4.The acting is good for the most partCons1.the ending isnt as big and suspensful as i was hoping.2.Although i liked the invasion angle i didnt like the way in the end it was just about mel gibson getting his faith in god back.3.It has a great deal of plot holes like why does the alien at the end not even try to protect itself, for aliens they sure die easily and they cant bust through a locked door but yet they are supposed to be a huge threat to the world.but anywho the movie does entertain you pretty much from start to finish even though it is kind of dissapointing."
1,"Scrap ""Signs"" and buy ""Alien"" if you want to be scared","This film re-affirms my cynical view of the Hollywood machine: throw in some a-list actors (Gibson and Phoenix) and a hot director with an amazing advertising/pr campaign and 'voila' you have a blockbuster hit. Kudos to the publicist who got M. Night Shyamalan on the cover of ""Time.""The ""Alien"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"" was an interesting premise, but it just doesn't deliver. During the viewing, I kept asking myself ""am I missing something?""And, yes, I get the religious aspects (losing faith, the last supper, revelations, bla bla bla). But at the end of the day, I found the film just plain boring. I would have left it at that until I watched feature afterwards, where M. and his crew talk at length about the film and M.'s technique. What pretentious ...-kissing! Guess M. doesn't stand for ""modesty."""
1,What a waste!,"Oh Mel! What have you done? I could sum up the entire movie in two words: Bulging eyes. There was very little dialogue, and what little there was, was let's say.. zzzzzzzzzz... There was little plot. I call it a B rated 1985 flick, pretty much equivalent to the ""Night Of The Living Dead."" We used to stay up late watching corny movies with friends on the weekends. This one was a snoozer! I was able to get up about five times to do things and STILL not miss anything! It was definately NOT a thriller!"
1,overhyped and disappointing,"All my friends were talking about how great this was and that it was frightening. So I, liking a good scare, decided to check it out with a friend. The beginning i thought it would be ok, with the whole ""children of the corn field"" going on. After viewing this movie and nearly falling asleep, I feel that this movie was underdeserving of the money it made at the box office. It's about aliens and the whole movie builds up to the actual alien attack. The building part is boring as is the attack, where they actual show the pathethic alien. Everyone lives and everything is great. This did not amuse me. Nothing remotely scary happens and the story line isn't that good. Save your money please! Even a 9 year old i know found this movie to be extremely dull with no frightening aspects."
3,"Good ideas, poor realization","M. Night Shyamalan has great ideas and an interesting mind for stories that push the edge as he so well demonstrated in 'The Sixth Sense'. Unfortunately in this very very slow movie his story gets overshadowed with the very usual and trite ""creatures from outer space"" look. One keeps wondering why these fears of extraterrestrial invasion are treated like all the other Hollywood horror movies with very similar storylines - that though these visitors are of superior intelligence they seem totally incapable of overcoming even the most absurd attempts at keeping them away from their 'goals'. One expects more from Shyamalan - more respect for imagination and working on fears that come from within instead of morphed, tired spacemen invaders. Could have been so much better had the director/writer left Hollywood (including a cameo using himself as an actor) out of it."
4,Good movie. Good disc.,"The polarization of opinions concerning director M. Night Shyamalan should not keep you from giving this Blu-ray a chance. I won't argue that this movie is the finest Shyamalan has to offer, but I will tell you that for its fans and those who enjoy a well-crafted thriller Signs is a good Blu-ray disc. Incorporating all the extras from the DVD, Signs on Blu-ray eclipses its legacy counterpart. Those who can make use of its uncompressed PCM audio track will enjoy a step up from the Dolby Digital of the standard definition disc. The video, while not the best example of what Blu-ray can do, is a faithful representation of the source material. This is a good movie, and a good disc; just arguably not a must-buy if you own the dvd."
3,"Good for a 1 time watch, but not spectacular","Mel Gibson and the environment the director created pretty much carry the movie, because the plot is ridiculas and unfullfilling. I don't want to give anything away, but I think the problem was the director wanted to make a statement that was illogical (Everything happens for a reason and is a sign from above) so he had to fill in the story line with things that really don't make sense. (This movie is NOT as good as the Sixth Sense)It would have been better as a sheer alien horror movie, however as it is, this is a movie to rent, not buy."
2,Good Acting / Poor Script,"Because the microphone was lowered into the frame quite noticeably and with such regularity, it gave the movie a very amateurish look and feel. Reason why Bruce Willis is not in this one: His career could not recover from the stink left behind. The only two things this movie reveals is good acting and a big dud of an ending. The acting just was not good enough to rescue the script. Some things are just best left unseen."
2,HOW MANY CLOSE-UPS OF MEL CAN WE TAKE!,No one in the theater was terrified at this movie. Comments heard and felt by me and my friends walking out were that it was a big disappointment. At times it was so unrealistic it was ridiculous! There were so many holes. I was amazed at how stupid the ending was. I wish I had rented the video instead of wasting my time and money going to the theater for this slow moving movie. I am so surprised so many people liked it and found it scary.
4,We really enjoyed this movie,This movie was alot better than most of the movies I saw last year. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the movie. While I was a little disappointed in the ending the first time I saw the movie after a second viewing I really came to appreciate what the director was trying to say and now enjoy the ending. This movie did not disappoint us at all and would reccomend it to others.
1,Barely Tolerable,"I saw this movie when it came out in theaters. It was one of those lazy days in jersey, so I figured that the movies would be a nice place to escape the heat. This movie was absolutely horrible. It was not scary or thrilling. Signs was extremely over hyped and over rated. I can not believe that Mel Gibson would want to be a part of this horrible movie. The scariest part of the movie was when the dog barked unexpectedly. From the cliché use of crop circles to the lame attack of aliens, this movie was worthless. I would rather spend my money on a chick flick than this movie. At least a chick flick has some sort of comic relief. I would recommend any movie over this one. If you feel the need to subject yourself to the torture of watching this movie, wait until it comes out on cable. I was so tempted to leave the theater. Take my advice: spend your $.. on something of value."
1,Bait and Switch At It's Worst,"Huge--I repeat--HUGE disappointment. I am both a fan of Mel Gibson and a fan of anything that deals with unusual phenomena (e.g. crop circles). I thought that I would be enlightened, amazed and/or entertained. Instead, I just felt ripped off. The flick has a promising start and then degenerates into a sub-B film, 50s-style ""ooh, those terrible alien monsters are gonna get us"" farce of papermache aliens who--despite being able to fly through space/time and make crop cirles of incredible complexity can't seem to break through wooden doors and--GROAN--are vulnerable to water!! Oh, give me a huge break. Compound fracture, even! It's not even scary--more like pathetic.This could have been an inspiring film based upon an awesome phenomena. Instead we get a cheap, poorly executed farce about aliens who have nothing better to do than terrorize earthlings. Go watch ""Contact""--anything but this."
1,BORING !,"This movie was so boring, I had to quit watching it after an hour.Just like he did with Unbreakable, the director puts you asleep after an intriguing beginning.How about that scene where Rory Culkin talks to Aliens with a baby monitor... I bet Mel Gibson was wondering what the hell he was doing there."
3,Great film this guy needs to do commentary some time,"Signs, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, all packaged and containing great M. Night Shyamalan films. But where is the director commentary?This guy likes to talk. We can see that on the extra stuff on the Sixth Sense DVD. So WHY not give some really good commentary on at least ONE DVD?It makes me want to download and not ever buy a DVD of his. He owes us."
1,An embarassment,"One of the worst attempts at -- what? -- I have ever seen. Mel Gibson doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. Joaquin Phoenix is obviously stoned out of his gourd (and who wouldn't be, given the totally absurd and vapid character he is given to portray?). The children are a combination of McCauley Calkin in ""Home Alone"" and Harry Potter, minus the humor or intelligence. Actually, ""Home Alone"" is probably the film most analogous to this one. Think of Joe Pesci as a dim-witted alien, dressed in a cut-rate rubber halloween costume, without the brains to do much except go bump in the night, and you've got the gist of this atrociously poor offering. How this one ever escaped into theaters is a question for the ages.When ""Signs"" is televised, reverse your TiVo's logic. The commercials are wayyyyy better."
5,Mel scores again!,"Mel Gibson has been absent from this genre too long. You will be on the edge of your seat for most of this movie. Wisely they have let the audiance imagination have full rein, never letting them see the aliens too close. I would highly recommend this movie, but not for the very young...too scary."
2,No intelligent life-forms in Hollywood,"I caught this again on TV the other night and it's actually not as bad as I remembered- there's some eeriness and high production values. These have got to be the dumbest aliens in the universe. They're allergic to H2O, so they come to a planet whose surface is 70% water. No need to use nuclear weapons on them, either, as locking them in the pantry seems to work. But their biggest blunder is that they've never seen a Mel Gibson movie. Mad Max/Road Warrior, Braveheart, The Patriot, Ransom: it ought to be common knowledge throughout the cosmos by now that you just don't mess with Mel Gibson's family. They're lucky all they get is a simple baseball bat to the head in this movie. All in all, your'e better off watching Independence Day for the hundredth time or the tongue-in-cheek They Live! featuring Roddy Piper."
4,Good for an alien movie,"Not the best, but completely interesting. I'd like to see the people who commented on it being unimaginative even come up with a story at all."
4,Spooky Winnie,This movie is awesome and one worth seeing. I feel it is based more around a family's tragedy though. If you want to see a movie with a ton of aliens running all over the whole length of the movie you won't. It is suspenseful though and keeps you on the edge of your seat at points. Don't miss out on this!
3,Bogus VISTA series release,"I am very disappointed with the DVD release of Signs. I love the film, and I'm a fan of Night's work, but how it qualifies as VISTA series I don't understand. The other titles in the series are at least 2 discs with DTS sound, bonus artwork, and unique packaging. I thought that's what made it VISTA series. It's implied when you hear ""Coming to video and VISTA series DVD"" in all the commercials. The people who bought the beautifully packaged, 4-disc Director's Cut of Pearl Harbor expected more than a typical keep-case and a 1-minute clip of Night's first creature movie? It's not right to set a standard and not stick to it. BVHE was on such a roll with VISTA. I hope that Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't get cheated the same way this film did when it hits VISTA series DVD in March.The film is wonderful, but there is no denying that more could have been done with the DVD."
2,"""Signs"": character development, not heavy handed F/X","M. Night Shyamalan crafts an intelligent and emotional extension of the ""are we alone?"" genre.No heavy-handed effects shots, so Independence Day it isn't. What it does have is something you don't see much anymore: character development, evolution and redemption in a sci-fi context.This might not work for the inattentive crowd, but for those who can put together more than a few sucessive thoughts in search of what the characters are feeling it's a refreshing change.Mel Gibson gives a very good characterization of an Episcopal Priest who has lost his faith, much to the detriment of his family, while Joaquin Phoenix does quite well as his live-in brother.Add two well acted kids, the family dogs, some peripheral characters, some tin foil (G) and a script that throws in just enough creeps as the whole world goes to hell around them and you have ""Signs"".Can't say much more without ruining things :-)"
1,"""Signs"" is the most hideous sci-fi film I ever watched.","This was the most disappointing sci-fi film I EVER watched.You have these aliens that have the technology to come all the way to earth, and the technology to make perfect crop circles.Then these same aliens can not go near the water, and do not have ray guns to kill people. Not hardly.One thing that disgusted me was the family came up from the basement after the invasion was over; and the plywood covering doors and windows were covered with these geometric shaped cut-outs (Stars, circles, cresent moons, etc)This is THE WORST sci-fi movie I ever saw, It was even worse than ""Independence Day""."
2,Boring,Signs is just a really boring movie. Its about a guy who wakes up and find crop circles on his property. They watch the news and theres alot around the world. Then the board up the house and wait for the alien atack. They Survive and its over. You only see the the aliens about 5 time and 2 close up. You can easiy tell that the aliens are people in costumes. They look like aliens from a 1970 independent alien film. I didnt like signs. Rent it.
1,bad,"a big disappointment. poor story, poor directing, poor acting. i've never seen kids who acted so much like adults. the ambience was reminiscent of hitchcock, but any resemblance stops there. not worth even a rental, much less a purchase."
1,boring,"I do not understand what people see in this movie. Gibson wears the same depressed expression and flat monotone voice from start to finish. The whole thing is too far outside of reality. Independence day had more reality and was a much better movie.This movie was slow and depressing with no satisfaction in it. I was disappointed and by the end was still waiting for the acting to start. All of the actors are way better than this.If you want a movie for background noise only that does not require actual interest, this is the movie to choose."
2,Why on earth do so many people like this movie?,"First of all I must say that ""Signs"" was the biggest letdown of a movie I`ve seen in a long time. There seemed to be so much hype surrounding this film when it first came out at the cinema. In addition it was earning rave reviews from all kinds of sources and I also heard a certain famous hollywood actor declare this as one of best films of last year. Anyway I fully expected an intelligent, original sci-fi thriller. What I got was a plot that was poor even by tv-movie standards. The script was equally awful and offered very little for Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix to work with. It could just as easily have been a prolonged episode of the X-files, although even the X-files never succumbed to such levels of mediocrity."
2,SIGNS ABOUT NOTHING,This short review among hundreds is probably meaningless. About as meaningless as this disappointing movie.M. Night Shymalan has carved a niche for himself with pseudo-spiritual thrillers. Mel Gibson is fine as a widowed minister who lost his faith in God and finds his isolated farm and family surrounded by demonic aliens. Joaqin Phoenix is terrific as Gibson's brother but the story sidesteps the tantalizing theological implications of the set-up and settles for being a remake of Hitchcock's The Birds.Too bad M. Night didn't make this a real showdown between demons and a disaffected minister. Now there's a movie.
2,lots of production in search of an idea,"Not much movie in this movie. How scary are aliens who can't figure out how to work door knobs?At the big ""dramatic"" climax I couldn't help but recall one of the Simpson's Halloween specials where the aliens Kang and Kodos invade to take advantage of Earth's recent world-wide disarmament, only to be thwarted when one lone human resists them using----a board with a nail in it!In the end, I guess the new Mysterious Power from Beyond helps Mel regain his faith in the old Mysterious Power from Beyond. But the heavily contrived interlocking deus ex machinae that riddle this movie didn't make me rediscover my faith in M. Night Shamalan-a-ding-dong.Rent this if it's a slow week at the video store, but save your money and storage space and DON'T buy this. I'm glad I didn't."
2,be one movie not 2,"The movie premises around circles & aliens but focuses entirely on this priest/reverend's family. They all say things that almost sound like they were taken from Independence Day, but it's all about them hiding in the cellar. I understand the movie's about their collective healing but it's wrong to base a movie on a sci-fi platform & then abandon that platform for an entirely different one. Mel didn't need to go with ""aliens"" to make this story."
2,This would have had more stars had it . . .,"Okay, aliens are freaky. Especially these ones. And especially considering I live in the midwest, surrounded by corn fields. The first bit of this film was pretty freaky. Unfortunately, M. Night Shylaman decides to put in some other overtones, and basically the whole film IS, in the end, about a priest who loses his faith then regains it after he realizes that God really DOES have a plan, and yes, his wife dying was part of it. This movie just suggests that humans have no free will whatsoever and I feel that even Christians will be upset with the message of this film. It turns silly and corny and doesn't leave me feeling creeped out at all; just upset that I wasted seven bucks."
3,Signs (2002),"I admit it: I saw this movie over two times in the theatres and I loved it. However, I need to be completely honest in this review so bare with me fans of the film...I'm going in! Mel Gibson stars as a former reverend in a small town, who lives on a farm with his brother and two children after his wife died about a year ago. When mysterious things begin to happen and crop circles appear on his land, the family begins to believe that they are being pursued by aliens from outer space. Surprisingly scary and well-acted, this film does show that it got its inspiration from George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. I mean, come on: group of people board themselves up in a house while the otherworldy enemies await them outside and desperately try to get in. But otherwise, I found this film to be extremely enjoyable and therefore, I had to see it several times. The theatre experience of this film however, is alot better than just seeing it on video or DVD."
1,Just a religious tract,"Add Mel Gibson, a right-leaning religious fundamentalist, and a director with little funds or ideas, and you get a pathetic religious tract -- full of the glory of faith, miracles, revelations, and the such... totally worthless, except for Gibson's fans or fanatic Christians."
3,"Humor, visual storytelling save this picture","You could drive a mothership through the plot holes in this movie, but it's very funny at times, and the deft intermingling of the everyday with the otherworldly is Spielberg at his best. What? This movie wasn't directed by Spielberg?Usually, bad science fiction elements prompt me to throw my popcorn at the screen and walk out, but unlike The Matrix or The Day after Tomorrow, Signs gets away with speculative murder by declining to take itself too seriously and by rendering the characters believably, if narrowly. Signs pretty much charms its way off the bottom shelf and onto my ""recommended"" list."
3,"OK, this is a stretch ...","I looked at this film as a dream sequence (or, more appropriately a nightmare). The aliens represented Mel Gibson's inner demons, the invasion of earth standing for his loss of faith in life and the world after the senseless death of his wife. The movie, therefore, is one man's subconscious attempt to find meaning in a world that's seemingly gone mad.That's about the only way that I could look at this mess and not frown at it. Otherwise, the plot seems too simplistic, the aliens too hokey (and kind of dumb, for that matter), and the script has a few too many clumsily written passages for its own good.But M. Night Shyamalan's bad movies are still better than many directors' good ones. Signs is rife with tension, owns a few startling moments, and there's also some good moments of lunatic comic relief. And Gibson gives a fine performance as the confused, hopeless reverend who says he's all on his own, but it looking for any sort of sign or reason to believe otherwise."
4,Good solid thriller,"This movie was very well done. It was spooky as well and a good story line in my opnion. I reallly like the crisis of faith storyline set against an alien invasion, a very original idea. I have read that it was ""B"" movie with ""A"" actors and it was just a variation of War of the Worlds, but I disagree. While it did seem to take a couple of themes from a couple of different movies it still stands alone as an original thriller. I feel it is worth watching and buying."
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * *,Who would like this: suspense/thriller fans & maybe mel gibson fans.Worth seeing...-in the theatre: no-buy it: no/maybe-rent it: yes*they're here...let your imagination go.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I saw this film with a group of teenagers from our CYO church group. The film is predictable and hokey. I found it to be a total waste of my time. Expose your teenagers to classics like ""Old Yeller"", ""The Trip to Bountiful"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""The Grapes of Wrath""....examples of beautiful movies that are timeless, unforgettable, inspiring and edifying! Don't waste your time with movies like Signs. They are an insult to the intelligence!"
1,Silliest movie ever - in a bad way,"This movie is perhaps the lamest film made in the last 20 years. Aliens who cannot stand water but don't wear protective gear star in this goofy film about how if enough incredibly stupid things happen, it indicates the hand of God at work.Perhaps you will enjoy this film if either you completely shut off your brain for the rest of your life, or if you appreciate it for the unadulterated badness of the entire premise."
4,A scary movie that's a cut above the rest,"M. Night Shyamalan continues to impress with this film. While some including the Amazon reviewer of this film found it overly atmospheric and unappealing, I found it to be everything that I had hoped it would be. It has moments that will make you scream or at least jump in your seat. It has moments that will make you laugh and moments that will make you think. The idea of not showing the aliens until the last minutes(the Brazilian party notwithstanding) serves the film well for 2 reasons 1) the viewer can imagine whatever they want and 2) makes the film more than a creature flick because one realizes at the end that the film wasn't about aliens but the loss and regaining of faith for one man. It might not be quite as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" where I still find clues everytime I watch, but it's still a good movie that'll provide some fun and some thought."
4,A great science-fiction film !,"The story is good and very realistic and some mystery and stirred up the emotionsThe actors act well, particularly Mel Gibson ( like in the patriot).You never get bored.M. Night Shyamalan's film is brilliant, so I highly recommended it."
5,"Scaryist film i've ever seen, but i loved it!!!","I am really 13 years old but I want to use the kids form. When I saw the t.v spots of this film it didnt look scary but it looked ok. When I herd it was scary it made me want to see it more. Now did i get a hell of a fright of how scary it was! Through the whole movie i was gripping to my seat. It was pure guenuis how this movie was done. Although I must warn parents that this is not sutible for younger childern, i spoke to all my friends who saw it and the are really freacked out! Although this movie was scary it has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Now to also say how scary it was, the second time i saw it I was still scared but that dosnt stop me seeing it for the third time. The first time i saw it i had a very sleepless night, and a whloe lot of 13-14 year olds I know did to. I carnt wait untill the DVD comes out! one last thing, THIS IS A REALLY SCARY MOVIE!"
3,Not as great as i hoped!,"Signs was another unbreakable to me... a slow drawn out movie until the end, except in this film the ending wasn`t as good as in unbreakable which also dissapointed me. Ever since I saw sixth sense I hoped that the director would put a little more effort in his future films and yet I am still waiting for another great movie as his first. Many loved Signs but for some reason I didn`t think it was as great as everyone thought... I almost feel asleep watching the movie and it didn`t really pick up until the end, and even the end was horrible and made no sense what so ever. It was a great waste of time, and if you have nothing else to do but to watch a drawn out boring movie with about two scenes with an Alien in it... definitley watch it but do not go in the Theatre`s expecting another great film like Sixth Sense!! If you want to know what it is about...well I`ts about the same story as in every other alien movie... aliens coming to Earth to concure it... that`s it!"
1,Was this one of the worst movies ever made?,"As a previous writer stated in his eloquent review, I also sat in the movie theater anxiously awaiting the film's end. This movie was quite frankly one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I can't believe M Night went from ""The Sixth Sense"" to this piece of trash. Its almost like one of those cheesy B-flicks with aliens, UFOs and bad acting. And since I hate corny B-movies, I also hate ""Signs"""
1,Cheesy and Pretentious,"'Signs' is the cheesiest alien invasion move to come along since the 1950s. What's worse, it tries to rise above its genre by overlaying the story of a minister who has lost, and regains, his faith. The movie takes itself very seriously, as if it has a profound insight to offer us. In reality, it is a predictable mishmash of pop superstition, cheap sentimentality, and a hissing stunt person in a green stretch-suit.If you want to see an alien invasion movie, get 'Independence Day'. At least it had the good sense not to take itself seriously."
5,SIGNS IS A GREAT THRILLER!!!!!!!!!!!,Signs is a great follow up to the best thriller in movie history The Sixth Sense..... Signs takes us to a family in PA where they begin to see crop circles in their farmland..... If you have not seen this great thriller then you really should check it out it is up there with The Sixth Sense!!!!!!
4,"Different, yet the same old song","Mel Gibson certanly wasn't stellar in this movie, but he wasn't bad either. There's really no excitment until near the ending of the movie. Before that, there's only events leading up to it, very slowly, but there's only crop circles and short flashes of things running past the house and into the cornfield. Not your typical alien thriller, yet some things never change. For instance, the Aliens always have bug eyes and from tapered fingers. For once couldn't they look a tad bit more human? Or am I thinking to Star Trekish?The glasses of water lined up around the house was a nice touch however. And unlike the sixth sense, the only true freaky part was when the alien was trapped in the pantry. I truly expected something dire to happen to Mel. Such as his fingers getting chopped off....Not a bad movie for scifi enthusiests, but not really entertaning for others not into such genre's."
1,One of the worst movies it has been my displeasure see,"I wish I could give an in depth review of Signs, but it would waste even more time than the 2 hours I spent watching it in the first place.In short, the movie is advertised as a thriller, in the beginning we are teased with an alien invasion worldwide, and then Shayamalan is nice enough to absolutely destroy any chances there were to make this movie great. The ending is anticlimactic.To be honest, they BLATANTLY LIE in the advertisements as to what the movies subject matter is. Remember the aliens and such in the preview? Well listen up, because this is VERY important........THERE ARE NO CLEAR SHOTS OF THEM, THEY ARE USED AS A BACKDROP TO A ""TOUCHING"" STORY OF A FAMILY COMING TOGETHER, AND BASICALLY PLAY A VERY LITTLE PART IN THE MOVIE. THE PREVIEW IS A LIE PLAIN AND SIMPLE, THIS MOVIE IS MORE LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE EPISODE.Sorry about the caps, but I feel it is very important to make sure you don't waste your money."
1,Recipe for Signs,"Take one part ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", one part ""Children of the Corn"", one part ""War of the Worlds"" and one part ""Night of the Living Dead"". Blend well for all audiences, add no heat or spice, and serve with a well-aged Swiss cheese that has fewer holes than the plot. Compliment with whole grain crop circle rounds, and nothing stronger than water."
1,Get a grip,"Just some questions:If you knew aliens were coming to your house, would you let your small children vote on whether to go?If you knew they were coming wouldn't you arm yourself, even with a kitchen knife? Wouldn't you call your neighbors, the cops, or the army?If you were an alien with the capacity to build starships with cloaking devices, yet had a severe allergy to water would you land on a planet that's mostly water? Wouldn't you wear a spacesuit, in case of rain or splashing?And by the way, how would you breathe the 95% humiidy type air in Pennslyvania in the summer?And by the way how about remembering to bring weapons?"
5,A great movie,"I saw this movie in theaters, and am impatiently waiting for it to come out on DVD. When I first went to see ""Signs"" I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I was totally blown away. If you have ever liked anything Hitchcock (my personal favorite, ""The Rear Window"" you will love ""Signs"". I'd recomend this to anyone, even if you aren't into scary movies. ""Signs"" has this wonderful suspense to it, and unlike many Mel Gibson movies, minimal violence."
3,"NO fluke, but not a master-piece","This is a solid movie, really beyond Hollywood stereotypes for alien movies. Very clever, very smart, sometimes badly conducted by Shyalaman. Anyway, the positive aspects suplant the negative ones by a large margin.I enjoyed it, only endorsing the general complaining about the weakness of the aliens.Gibson and Phoenix give solid performances ...As for the young CUlkin, don't much of a future for him. ..."
5,He's Right,... This is the best movie i've ever seen. The storyline is very smart. It's even funny and freaky. Freaky but not scary it's a little bit of everything and the storyline is great. And Mel Gibson is awsome. But anyway this is an AWSOME movie...
2,disappointing,"While most of the movie was quite decent, this movie lacked an ending and really could have done without Mel Gibson's faith journey. To make a movie that seemed like it could have had so much out of a topic so creepy and end up with a few cheap thrills and no real story line, not to mention so many loose ends you could trip walking out of the theatre, I was let down. I say, more alien less useless talk."
2,Mel Could Have Bored the Aliens To Death..,"I had high hopes for this show but felt dissapointed by the agonisingly slow pace & poorly written screenplay. The characters and their responses to this extraordinary situation were simply not very believable and the whole thing just left me thinking ""who cares?"" And the part where they boarded up the entire house and then retreated to the cellar was a direct rip-off from'Night of The Living Dead' - a far superior suspense thriller/horror. I feel this director is way over-rated. His films are all so pretentiously self-important but the underlying idea behind this latest one was shallow shallow shallow. I feel the real truth behind crop formations is far more interesting than this dreadful movie which left me with no food for thought whatsoever concerning the phenomenon."
5,If you didn't love this film...,"I hate to say this, but the only people I've talked to who didn't like this movie completely missed the point. This is surprising, because the movie does an excellent job in showing it to you.This is an incredibly well conceived movie. The theme hinges on this principle: everything happens for a reason. Gibson's character, a priest who gave up his faith when his wife died, believes that things just happen and there is no reason behind it.All along the way there are signs (hence the title) that there is a reason that things happen the way that they do. At the end, they all merge together like pieces of a puzzle. A very intense and moving film, with incredible depth and emotion."
2,"Acting was GREAT, but story line was lacking!","I was expecting an edge of your seat drama/thriller. The previews I saw made the movie look great; and those parts were, but those were the only parts. All the ""good"" scenes were used in the previews because that was all there was. Although the story was sorry, the acting was great. Mel Gibson did an outstanding job! Thank God for that one redeeming quality!"
3,does it measure up to the hype?,"""Signs"" opened after a massive publicity campaign, and the movie audiences had great expectations. Newsweek featured director M. Night Shyamalan on its cover, touting him as potentially the next Spielberg.The first half of the movie seem to qualify for its hype, as we are introduced to strange happenings and to the complex character, former Anglican priest (Mel Gibson) who has lost his faith after the sudden death of his wife. He is left to raise his son and daughter alone, with the help of his younger brother, a failed minor league baseball player who has moved in with the bereaved family. The juxtaposition of their routine life with the supernatural is intriguing.The second half of the movie fails to deliver, as we are introduced to glimpses of ""spacemen"" who look like a fourth grader's idea of interplanetary invaders. There is one good, comic scene involving aluminum foil headgear. Overall the remainder of the movie is disappointingly trite and unsatisfying."
1,"Way to go, M. Night!","Plot summary:Aliens that are killed by water travel across the universe to a planet literally saturated with it, only to be foiled by such high-tech human weaponry as the wooden door.By far one of the worst movies starring Mel Gibson not involving a midget on a giant retard's back.Dear M. Night,Please stop insulting my native PA and start shooting them in Ohio, or better yet, New Jersey. That is all."
1,Ignore the 'Signs',"Rarely has a movie looked this great from the trailers, and stunk so badly in the theater. Signs was such a huge letdown for me. I was so excited to see it. Mel must have wandering around in the wheat fields for too long when he signed on. M. Night (one of the coolest names in the world, I must admit) really hoodwinked Mel to do this picture.The film is suspenseful until the aliens show their faces. My mouth literally fell open. They look just like B-Movie rejects, some dude in a Gumby costume. These aliens come across light years and then get stuck in a pantry. Mmm, donuts . . . must be what lured them in. And I won't spoil the end, but you would THINK the aliens would have done some research on the atmospheric conditions of Earth before they decided to arrive and take over. One of the worst movie resolutions I have seen.And Mel has a long conversation with his wife as she is impaled on a tree. God help me . . . aren't there any COMPETENT aliens to beam me up?"
1,Horrible,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everyone who watched this with me left the room before it was over. Just dreadful.
2,pew,"remember the scene with the alien at the party LMAO... what was he doing walking the streetswhat was with the alien on the roof... i mean he was looking directly inside so why didnt he bust through the window since they struggle to get past wooden doors... instead he jumped off and ran into the cornfield.did anyone notice the alien at the end was the same one he cut the fingers off of. so the alien comes back for revenge... like aliens hold grudges. LMAO""swing away"" LMAO the big end is an alien getting beaten with a baseball bat... did anyone see how shakey the alien was? looked like effects from the 1960s."
3,It's kind of.............meh.....,"It's not a bad movie, it's just not that great either.It starts out interesting enough.The acting is fine, the script is fine.But the ending is kind of lame, and it wont ever hold up against say........the original Alien.But still, it's a fun way to kill an evening.I recommend a rental."
2,Very disapointing,"I bought Signs because it sounded really interesting on the cover, unfortunately it was a big let down. There are some slightly creepy, intense moments but this film could have been so much better. They should have concentrated more on the aliens and not all this faith mambo jambo. M Knight Shylaman should have entertained us more instead of trying to make some deep thinking psychological drama because reading the box it reads like its an action thriller so I feel cheated. I wouldn't recommend buying this because its one of those 1 watch only type films. On the plus side the acting and picture is very good and there are some good scenes but just rent it."
4,M. Night's best so far...,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable, scary/suspenseful movie. I thought the opening credits were a bit corny (it actually reminded me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail's opening credits :) ), but the movie itself was very engaging and well-done. I was hooked from the first scene!"
4,Great Movie,"This movie was about a farmer who happens to be an ex-father, whose wife just died, and is living with their two kids & his brother. Early one morning the find crop circles in thier crop. It was orginally thought to be a hoax but later prooved wrong.It was a great thinking movie as well as a great scary movie. However, people who just like the scary part may be a little bored when it comes to the stuff you have to think about afterwards. Also, it jumps right into the plot and you don't get to see daily life before the ailen stuff starts.Overall, it was a great movie and leaves you thinking are you a part of group 1 or group 2."
2,Signs,"I was underwhelmed by this film...probably because I was expecting more, based on favorable reviews that I had heard... very predictable,melodramatic plot"
3,Check your mind at the door,"Like other horror movies (Most Movies) I had to check my mind at the door. If I don't I'll pick apart movies. Yes this movie has some problems, but what movie doesn't. I rate a movie on how it pulls me into the story. This movie did a good job at that. It has its scary moments as well as a ending that was to predictable. The ending was the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Worth renting to see If you like it before you buy. I'm thinking if I'll buy it."
3,A good movie that is still disappointing,"Knowing this movie is made by M. Night Shyamalan, I knew there would be a twist at the end. There was a twist and I was dissappointed by it.This movie is full of crop circles and alien invasions and what the people of earth are doing to react to the aliens. The movie probes possible ways to defeat the aliens and possible reasons why the aliens are here. Then the ending comes.To me, M. Night Shyamalan's aspirations were too low with this movie. He made a point with an ending that really had nothing to do with the previous 100 minutes of the movie. And that is too bad because he is a good filmmaker. But I guess it is unfair to expect another movie as good as the Sixth Sense."
4,Signs,"Its an interesting movie. I saw it in theaters back then. MelGibson is a great actor for this movie, and the UFOs and thespecial effects are unbeleveable to see. I like the part aboutthe guy was watching the newscast part, that was pretty interesting, really a good sci fi film. at almost to the end there was some parts that you have hold on to your seat. I wasgood. You got to see it, to believe it."
3,Flattered to deceive :-(,"I remember the struggle I went through to get back to my dorm in the middle of the night after viewing ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the basement of another dorm.During the first half of ""Signs"", I had the impression that I would be in for another round of getting spooked by the shadows on the way back home. Thankfully, Manoj N Shyamalan spared me those, with his silly ending."
3,Signs slips,"If Signs were 20 minutes less, it would be a great movie. The cast and crew do a great job, but the story is just too long and involved. I found myself bored about half way through. It takes a round about way of resolving itself, which makes it interesting. The lady who plays the police officer did a great job.I recommend seeing it."
2,Dumb and dumber,"I do not understand why this film is so popular. Mel Gibson seems like he is walking his way through it and can't wait until he is finished. The premise is silly, the action is confusing and you walk out of the theater wishing you hadn't wasted the time. The flashbacks are disconcerting and the ending is almost funny instead of serious. It is very predictable. A disappointing film."
5,Signs,"Hands down - much better than ""The Sixth Sense""! Kept me on the edge of my seat! A must-see in theatres to get the full effect!"
5,Blu-Ray Signs,I had already seen this movie several times and love it so much. i only buy movies on disc i really really like. and this was one of them. 5/5 stars. The disc arrived to my home quickly and i am very happy all around.
1,Seriously?,"Okay, these aliens are smart enough to build spaceships, travel lights years, but are too stupid to pull a plank off a window or turn a doorknob? They invade a water planet, even though water kills them? And aren't smart enough to wear a wet suit or even bring an umbrella, really? They don't have any weapons except their natural defenses, meaning they must come in physical contact with the enemy, really? They drop them off one at a time in corn fields or vacant lots, really? This is the DUMBEST movie ever made."
2,"The Sign says ""Do Not Enter""","I watched this on a Saturday afternoon with my daughter. She was roaring with laughter. Why??? Because it borrows ideas from so many films - it's like a clip reel. The only reason to watch would be to see Abigail Breslin as a little girl (she was fantastic) and Joaquin Phoenix in a tinfoil hat.There are far better films about aliens ... like um ""Alien"" for example. This one is okay - not great."
2,Read the Signs and Reviews.,"this is a dvd is nice to own but cant be watched everyday (as is always the case with other M. Night films). i like how the plot thickened and revealed one by one the myriad of coincidences which helped the characters beat the enemies.. one downfall though is the whole film being so predictable (or i expected too much). not sure if the director tried to imitate spielberg's style especially in the scene where phoenix and gibson gabbed and shared some coincidences in their lives. reminds of Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report in an instant ..features-wise, loaded and deluxe in nature. very helpful in understanding the director's past and future career undertakings.. the making of the film was exhaustively discussed also. overall, nice dvd for a low price."
3,Good but not as good as the Alien films. Needed more.,"With more action this film would be a lot better. Sure it was scary, and the acting was great, but I expected visually stunning effects on top of the chilling suspense. The cast were all wonderful, especially the children. Mel Gibson gave his best as well as Jaquin Phoenix. Good but not great. Reccomended for Hitchcock style films."
2,A pretty suspenseful movie but...,"I saw this movie because it was shot less than 10 minutes from where I live. To clear something up- people living in Bucks County don't have accents, have more than one pharmacy, and don't know everyone. In fact, one of the local highschools (we have 3) have more than 1 thousand each. But that is beside the point. I thought the movie was great up until the ending. If they die from water, then what how did they live that long? There's water in the air- water vapor- all the time-especially in the summer, when the film was shot. It rains a ton here too. If they had come across a sprinkler, they would've died on the spot. Besides, there are tons of lakes- here and everywhere else. But what was surprising to me was that the people in the MIDDLE EAST, a desert, is where they figure out that water harms them- that's incredibily dumb.I for sure thought it was suspensful, but once I realized how stupid the plot really was, it became a 2 star movie for me."
2,M. Night Shyamalan finally fell short,"Knowing that he came up with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" I thought that this film was going to live up to that kind of creativity, which it didn't. I was pretty disappointed in the low level of suspense. The film lagged. I looked at my watch expecting to see that it had been almost two hours, when it had only been 45 minutes! I was very bored, and the only reason why I kept watching was because the fact that M. Night Shyamalan made it promised me a great surprise ending, but it didn't! I had a few laughs, but other than that, I was bored and disappointed. It was just under ""okay."" Kids should be able to see it though. The PG-13 rating is just due to some moments that make you jump (but there aren't many!)."
5,"Great Movie, Awesome Thriller","I thought Signs was a fantastic thriller. It kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Unlike Independence day, this movie didn't rely on special effects, high tech action or blood/guts. It was a pure psychological thriller. Looking at the individual emotional reactions to a possible alien invasion rather than a global reaction. Acting was very good and the ending will not dissapoint. Highly recommend this movie."
4,Finding God During the War of the Worlds,"This film has what so many movies today lack: it's expertly made, emotionally involving with wonderful performances, and it challenges its audience by telling one story (losing and finding faith) in the framework of another (an alien invasion).Mel Gibson is superb as the former Father trying to hold on to his family even after his heart has been ripped out. After playing emotionally raw characters from LETHAL WEAPON to HAMLET, he proves he can also nail a devastated, lifeless man overwhelmed by loss.The extras were very interesting: in the Making Of documentary, it shows how the film commenced shooting on September 11th, 2001 and the director shares his feelings about that and the loss of a family member later in the filming.A filmmaker definitely worth keeping an eye on."
4,What's it's all about...,"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD and was really bored with it and often wondered what all the hoopla was about. But the movie did draw me in and I stayed with it because I had to find out what was going to happen.The last ten or so minutes of the film is worth all the time that went before. To see this movie as a SciFi film or a Horror movie is to miss what it is about. It's a powerful allegory. Perhaps seeing so much of Mel discussing The Passion made it easier for me to realize - but this is not a movie to be taken literally. The water is not a gimmick - it's a symbol. The aliens aren't a gimmick - they are symbolic of the problems one faces when one has lost faith.I will watch this movie over again a few times, I'm sure, looking for the symbols/signs I missed the first time.What I thought would be the worst movie I've ever seen has turned into one of the most haunting and rewarding."
1,blaaaaaaarrrggggg!!! <---- sound of puke spewing fourth,"IT'S WATER! THE ALIENS' WEAKNESS IS WATER!!! there, i just saved you from the biggest waste of time ever.this guy is probablly the most overrated director of the last 10 years. this is complete crap!"
3,No big deal...,"Finally saw this the other day and... it was okay, but it reminded me a bit of 'Secret Window' in that it had a decent, albeit slow, spooky build up that just fizzled out. Mel Gibson phones in another performance, and Home Alone's brother is the better actor in the family, but Joaquin Phoenix, though a bit wooden at times, was good. Overall, I too liked the glasses of water slant, but one thing that I can't get past is this: How could aliens find their way to earth, make these incredible crop circles, be invisible during the day, and yet not have a plan to deal with a substance that makes up over 70% of the earth??? Maybe it WAS just a coincidence."
1,If you scare easily then this movie might scare you,"Very disappointing movie. Mel Gibson was miscast for this role. His portrayal of a former minister was very flat; he didn't pull out any of his character's emotions. I didn't know what he was feeling except that he didn't like God because of the death of his wife; but what did that have to do with liking or disliking aliens? There wasn't any insight into who he was or who he had become. Phoenix did a good job as did the two children. The director's short part should have been eliminated or his character should have been expanded upon; who was he, why did he cause the accident, how did he feel because of it? If you scare easily, then this movie might scare you, but if it takes a lot to scare you, then don't expect much."
1,totally illogical,"So these advanced space aliens come from light years away, select Earth to attack, and then are killed by water? Couldn't they see from space that the planet was 2/3'rds water? Have you even gone into a field of corn late at night? You get soaked just from the condensation on the corn stalks. Why weren't there hundreds of aliens killed while knocking down the corn stalks? You see the advanced aliens needed to make crop circles to tell the other aliens where to aim the guns. How ridiculous!These amazing aliens can leap three stories: from the fields to the top the houses and back down again -- but they can be trapped and held in a food pantry?Give me a break. At least have a plot that's consistent."
1,Waste of 2 hours,"This movie [stunk]. It had a lot of potential, what with the plot and such, but it was built along the 'Jaws' lines of not seeing the monster until that last bit of the movie, but it didn't work this time. There were a few amusing one-liners here and there, but the way it was shot just was rotten. All of the major scenes with stuff going on, the camera focused on an inanimate object [Flashlight, basement] and all you could hear was the action. And when you finally got to see the alien, it was all dark. Yeah, I'm one of the guys who likes to see the bad stuff.And then, the ending. Aliens invade, scare the [heck] out of the world, and then just leave and take a few people with them? I could go on for hours, but the part that I found most annoying for some reason was the very end, with Mel putting his jacket on and leaving the room, then the credits start. What a HORRIBLE ending. This movie better not have a sequel."
1,"""Signs"" better left unseen","""Signs"" movie was SUCH a disappointment; a real let-down. After seeing M. Night's fantastic ""Sixth Sense"", I was really looking forward to this one. All for nothing. ""Signs"" came across as amaturistic, predictable and not at all scary. Flashlights, bumps in the night ... kinda hokey. And the aliens?!? Looked like the SleeStacks (sp?) from the 1970s ""Land of the Lost"" (remember that?). I'd love to see M. Night come up with another brillaint hit. This one missed."
3,Poorly executed storytelling.,"I gave this film three stars because it is inadvertently and unintentionally laugh-out-loud hilarious at times -- just for Mel Gibson's completely off-key acting alone.Shyamalan presents an obtuse, preachy message about faith with languid, melodramatic pacing; he manages to kill the suspense at every turn (I'll igonre the plot-holes). Hitchcock said less is more and Shyamalan plays off of that, attempting to invoke subtlety with a nod to camp suspense conventions of a prior era, but somehow he manages to be incredibly heavy-handed with the sparse bit of content he's working with. I think it just misfires on all counts, and what we have is a lesson in bad filmmaking worth a few good laughs. I was completely unengaged by it and I expected it to be much, much better than it was."
1,Stay away from this movie,"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the acting is fine.As to the story, it is with more holes than swiss cheese."
1,Leave rationality at the doorstep,"....when watching this movie.First off - why can't these aliens that just came from lightyears away manage to open a door??And if they are killed by water, then why can they walk around in our atmosphere, which is filled with it??I would have expected more from the director. Instead, I got a lame attempt at trying to mystically explain something that is done by human pranksters at home (crop circles). Don't buy it."
1,woefully disappointed,"This was the second M. Night S. movie I watched. The first of course beingSixth Sense, which I enjoyed.Unfortunately, Signs didn't hold the same interest for me. I found it tiresome and boring.I continued to watch it in the hopes that something might happen, but it just kept on with its tedious wandering. It seemed to lack direction and focus.With the exception of Unbreakable, I think most of M. Night's movies (after Sixth Sense) have been a painful let-down.I can't recommend this movie and am not sure I look forward to anymore ofM. Night's future movies.This movie reminded me of one important thing. Time is not a renewableresource. Some of which I lost watching this movie."
1,"""plot"" does not equal ""drama""","There's a not-well-respected genre called the ""shaggy God"" story, of which ""Star Trek V"" is one. ""Signs"" is another.It's a numbingly dumb film, in which the ending was conceived first, then the ""plot"" constructed to force the desired ending. (""My Cousin Vinnie"" has the same lame construction.) This rather negates the philosophical and metaphysical debates at the center of the film. How can you have a meaningful discussion about man's relationship with God, when the writer/director is _playing_ God?Mel's performance is okay, I guess, but he persists in interpreting ""confused"" or ""upset"" as ""loony."" He adores the Three Stooges, and too much of that adoration informs his performances (qv, ""Maverick"").The worst of M. Night's three films and the last, I hope, until he comes up a story idea as good as ""The Sixth Sense."""
3,Mixed Feelings,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theater. The fact that I live very close to the county that this movie was set, added a little spookyness to it.As far as the movie is concerned, it was one of those movies that has you on the edge of your seat, only to make you wonder what happened. There are things in the movie that simply don't add up. For those who have seen it, remember what Mel Gibson's brother did at the end? Simple humans would have been able to get out of that situation, yet alone an advanced species!Overall, I liked the movie, but it lacked in the realism department. Plus, the ending was too much of a quick drop.I'd recommend that you rent this movie first, and then buy it if you like it. This way, you have some insurance that you're not stuck with a movie you don't like."
4,a b movie with a well known actor,"first of all let me say that this is a b movie that happens to star mel gibson. this alone will make most people feel this isnt a b movie, yet it is. the story is basically aliens come to earth and attack people. this is not a bad thing though, i happen to be a b movie fan(i have seen troll 2 more times than i can count). this movie is pretty good and actually makes you jump at times, unlike most of todays ""horror"" movies. Yet there is problems with it, i feel the way everything works out in the end is sort of cheezy, i wont ruin the ending but most people after watching it will know what i mean, and some of the humor isnt funny at all. but overall quite good."
5,Startler,"This is a scary movie with authentic scares, some surprises, some cheap thrills, and a sense of humor. It has good acting even though it is a simple plot, but that's okay. Far better than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Let me rephrase that, it is scarier than those two, but those two had a better plot and story. Oh well, this is a great movie to buy or rent. See it!"
2,MediaGab Review,"I'll start by saying this is not Mel Gibson's best film. ""Signs"" is a sci fi thriller or at least it is supposed to be. The expectation of this movie going in is nothing close to what actually happens in the movie. Gibson's performance is sub par against movies like ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Braveheart"".A family living on a farm notices crop circles in their cornfield. After thinking it is a vandal, they determine it is a sign for something else. Without giving the movie away it turns out to be a life or death situation for all mankind.The acting in this movie...wait there was none. Every actor had the same expression, none. There was not one smile or laugh in the whole movie. Everyone had a serious look and mood to them for the whole movie.Overall this movie had the feel of a low budget horror flick with a big name actor. I rate it a 2 out of 5. I only give it a two for the suspense. It does keep you in the movie engaging you to know what is going on."
2,How stupid is this movie?,"Let's see, we've got aliens who can travel the stars, but can only navigate across the earth using crop circles. Aliens who communicate on low-tech AM radio so they can be detected on a baby monitor. Aliens who have the technology to create giant invisible space ships, yet are so pathetic they cannot break down a door or boarded window, who are so weak that one can be trapped by a veterinarian in his pantry. The first time we see an alien, it looks like a mime in a green suit.And the message: Mel Gibson has lost his faith in the early scenes. Will he regain his faith by the end of the movie? Three guesses.All the money and technology behind this film, and in the service of ... what? A third rate 1950's sci fi story that would have been rejected by Astounding stories.I've given it two stars because it was entertaining in parts, had some okay performances, and the aluminium foil hats were funny."
2,Very Disappointing...,"With all the hoopla, a major draw like Mel and the fact that Signs was filmed a few miles down the road from where I live, I was ready to snuggle in and enjoy a winner. NOT the case... This movie starts out good (5 minutes) and then deteriorates into a low budget alien attack flick, except that the aliens appear at the very end and are frankly pathetic. Theres not much to keep your attention, the acting is marginal, and the plot is simply rediculous. Very little if any of the weak plot makes sense. Put your money into Twilight Zone reruns."
5,Signs,"To all who have not seen Signs,You should really make it a point to see this film. This Film is a Masterpiece, I'm really not a big fan of Mel Gibson, But i have to Admit i really liked his proformance in this Film, The Film has a certain scariness to it....i have to be honest it really scared me. After awhile of watching this film i thought i was watching the news. i was so involed, i was on the edge of my seat....well worth seeing....in my opinion is a 10 stars.Signs [Blu-ray]"
4,"Entertaining, thrilling and suspensful!","Ever wonder what it would be like for you and your family to encounter creatures from another world. Well step into the shoes of ex Reverend Graham Hess as he and his family discover crop circles in their back yard just to hear about similar crop circles on the news. Grip your emotions and stir your senses. Get ready for a well paced, edge of your seat suspensful thrill ride. Definitely recommended."
3,"Disappointing plot, awesome theatrics","While the theatrical part of this movie was very well done, the plot suffered. This movie left a few question unanswered (why were they under siege?) and in some cases made little sense. All in all, I felt this movie was decent primarily due to the theatrical aspect."
1,Get a grip,"Warning- this review contains spoilers.How can you take seriously a movie in which aliens travel across the galaxy, but forget to bring weapons?In which the the hero, knowing aliens are in his town allows his small children a vote about whether or not to leave?Knowing the aliens are coming, does he arm himself and his family?Do they even bother to grab knives from the kitchen?Do they call their neighbors, the police or the army? No no no.And these aliens, who have cloaking devices and spacecraft, but are seriously allergic to water, why do they land on a planet that is mostly water? Especially without spacesuits?And, by the way, how do they breathe the Pennsylvania summer air, which has to be 95% humididy?"
2,At least it's got Mel Gibson ...,"Well, there are alien invasions, and then there are alien invasions - and as invasions go, this one has a LOT of problems. Turn off your brain, don't think too hard about why aliens are invading a planet that is 75% water (which they are apparently allergic to), and enjoy Mel. Certainly not one of his more memorable flicks (stick with ""The Year of Living Dangerously""), he almost manages to pull the nose up enough on this one to keep it from going straight into the dirt. Two out of five for effort."
3,A Sign of the Times,"Just wanted to add my two bits by way of a review - The film is good! You cant help but be a bit disappointed when it does not have a whopper of an ending like The Sixth Sense, though ! As usual, Shyamalan uses deception well to show one thing but prove something else. Personally, i'm a believer in a higher force that controls our destinies and i think Manoj makes a point to show its existence skillfully without too much of religious overtones."
4,A review that's worth reading,"If you think of how many films there have been on this subject it will surprise you to know how well this film did. Mel's a little older but other than the times he is doing the 'choking face that's trying terribly not to cry' (a la Ransom and Patrioit) his character of a disolutioned ex-priest is entertaining. There is some clever humor and adult-child interraction all centered around the 'arrival' of what ever left the crop circles. There is some genuine suspense and clever twists on the old ET concept and the special affects are just right, although they play second fiddle to the human condition and observation...it's clever, thoughtful and not once did I want to go get a smoke the entire film."
5,A Positive Sign,"""Signs"" is a movie not to be missed. This is not just a sci-fi flick; it is about spiritualism and faith as well. Mel Gibson plays a minister who has lost his faith in a well crafted story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will surprise and amaze you at the end in much the same way as the director's earlier film ""The Sixth Sense."" No Hollywood ending here, just a very satisfying and significant ending."
3,I'm getting realllllllllly fed up with Mel Gibson,"This is a disappointing film. It could have been a better-than-average alien invasion yarn -- but they made the mistake of showing the aliens in close-up, which destroys the ""unknown"" factor. (The one shot of the guy passing the Brazilian alley would have been sufficient.) But more important, the whole flying saucer/crop circles thing places a definite back seat to Mel Gibson's rather pushy, rather smug religious message. It's not only disappointing, it's bloody annoying."
2,Art Bell's Cattle Mutilation Dreamland,"M. Night's movie, bloated on its own hype, is untethered. It's vapid and vagrant and floats away; not even Mel Gibson can get it back."
1,slower than molasses,"I like a scarey movie just like any one else.The trailors and theme seemed like something out of xfiles. But once actually got to watching it, if it moved any slower we'd be going back in time.THe entire movie minus the beginning seemed very drawn out and slow. I was ready to walk outo a number of times, but stayed to see what the ending was.This is one that probably should of skipped theatrical viewings and went straight to tape/dvd."
1,Worthless,"This is not a good movie. I'm telling you, if you buy it you won't like it. M. Night Shamalyan is not a movie director. The Sixth Sense was ok, Unbreakable was awful, and this was the worst one yet(It didn't even have Bruce Willis in it). Mel Gibson's acting is boring and predictable in this movie, and it's hard to like a character Joaquin Phoenix plays after seeing Gladiator. The children are ok in this movie and the little girl is sometimes funny, but they dont have any real talent. Let's get one thing straight, also, THIS MOVIE IS NOT SCARY!! Watching a flashlight roll around on the ground is not scary. I don't know how someone watched this movie and thought that it was a winner. Don't buy it. Please. Just Don't. Trust Me."
1,War of the Worlds,"If you liked this film, congratulations! You just saw War of the Worlds, bastardized and stolen, without so much as credit. But wait - replace corals with water, subtract decent plotline and add cheesy humor and M. Night Shyamalan's questionable appearance and bad acting. While you're at it, disable your brain's logical unit. NOW you have War of the Worlds.H. G. Wells' classic novel is ruined in this unadmitted adaptation, which does a great job at tricking the viewer with a promising trailer, but instead subjecting one to a story that doesn't really tie together (aliens are deathly afraid of water, yet don't mind romping around in the cornfields, which god knows are damp with dew).Read War of the Worlds instead - it's a much more interesting novel that doesn't insult your intelligence."
1,Time To Sleep,"This movie is slow just like the other M. Night Shyamalan movies. I don't know about everyone else but I need a faster pased film to hold my attention, otherwise it puts me to sleep. This movie put me to sleep just like his other 2 movies. Lets hope if he ever makes another film that it is faster pased."
5,Great Film,"It drives me nuts when people are too analytical. Allow yourself to get sucked in. This film made me laugh. This film made me cry. Best of all, this film scared the heck out of me. There is also a great underlying message. Go see it!"
2,Gets worse the more you think about it...,"I am sorry, but I don't understand how this movie is garnering so much praise! I really wanted to like it, and went to see it on the first night (which is something that I rarely do), but am giving it more than one star only because there are quite a few touching and/or funny moments. Overall, the whole story is entirely too implausible. You end up waiting for that Night trademark twist ending that will make the whole mess make sense, but it never comes. This movie dies with a whimper."
3,"Ah Mel, I expected much better...",This movie attempts unsuccessfully to blend a Man vs. Himself theme with a science fiction theme involving aliens. The editting was confusing. Several deleted scenes should never have been deleted as they would have made the movie make more sense. Still others I wonder why they were put in to begin with.
5,"Finally, a masterpiece (but some are too blind to see it)","I guess movies have been so crappy lately people have forgotten what a good movie really looks like. Signs isn't about logic, it isn't about action, it isn't about details. Signs is about emotions, fears, and about how we choose to view life. But it seems people are too concerned about logic and realism too see this movie for what it really is. What people aren't realizing is that this movie is not about an ALIEN INVASION. This movie is about one person, and how it affects him and forces his outlook upon life. But wait...why, it's not logical for aliens to fear water and blah blah blah...IT DOESN'T MATTER. Alfred Hitchcock would love this movie."
1,Can't believe Mel consented to be in this movie.,"Started off great and ended up a huge flop. Now let's see. We have an alien race that conquered space, but cannot break into a basement door or out of a wooden pantry door. They navigated through space to find earth, but needed signs in corn fields for local directions. Horrible screen play. Really bad movie."
4,Only because I haven't seen the DVD....,"I saw the movie in the theater and, to borrow from Keanu Reeves and Joey Lawrence, ""WHOA!!"" I LOVED this movie, and poo-poo on all youse guys who say otherwise. This movie scared the stuffing out of me, and they only showed the alien for like five seconds! It was brilliant! And to whoever it was that said ""I liked seeing Night do Sci Fi"", 'ello! Where have YOU been?!? His other movies WERE Sci Fi!Sorry, I'm a little ranty right at the moment. I just loved this movie and I'm seeing many people mercilessly panning it and these are probably the people who liked the Matrix sequels.You should all grovel at the feet of M. Night Shyamalan. He's a genius.Kay, bye."
3,Aliens invade Mel Gibson,"Mel Gibson plays a minister who has come out on the wrong end of a crisis of faith. He loses his wife to a freak car accident, and becomes quietly embittered. His two children and brother live with him, but there is a sad distance between him and the family.Signs begin to appear, cut out of farming crops. They appear to be alien in nature, and people are torn between believing they are the calling cards of explorers, or navigational signals of invaders.The real story, though, is how these aliens effect Gibson and his family--especially him. Ironically, he ultimately sees the aliens as barers of signs--though not from themselves.Bottom-line: This is a plodding, but dramatic psychological story. It has wonderful material for conversations, it does well as a ""made for TV"" level movie. Those seeking action should go elsewhere."
3,3 of 5,"M Night Shyamalan uses the psyche of his audience against them. He uses what's not on screen to pump fear into their hearts; suggestive music, lighting and camera angles to build a sense of dread where there is nothing to fear. So the monster in Signs; a movie that drags along at a slow methodical pace; doesn't show itself until the end. And even then, it's mostly hidden in shadowy TV-screen reflections.The problem for Shyamalan is that it isn't scary. It is somewhat suspenseful, yes. The ending, in which the Hess family borders all the windows and doors of their Philadelphia home and hides in the basement, reminds me of the classic Night Of The Living Dead. But, despite a plot that has reptilian space aliens traveling to Earth from presumably light years away, it wastes too much of its time not really going anywhere.marcellee.com"
2,Horror or comedy?,"This film was enjoyable - but as a comedy and not the horror film it was meant to be. And I am not referring to the ""subtley injected humor"" mentioned in the Amazon description - the parts that were meant to be frightening came off so poorly that they were laughable.There were some mildly moving moments, but alas these are insufficient to save this failed scion of the horror genre...Ah well... at least the little girl was cute, right?"
3,Good Ideas with Average Applications,"If you're looking to curl up in front of your television with a semi-scary, suspenseful movie that allows you to sit in the dark and be completely absorbed, this is not the movie for you. Like the Sixth Sense, the director seems compelled to make the viewer think about what they are watching, and that's not a bad thing at all. However, the previews for this movie lead one to believe this is just some fun fluff that won't arouse any sincere emotion, and that's just not the case. I went to see this movie in the theater with my girlfriend, and after it was over, both of us were just staring at the credits, scratching our heads and saying, ""Huh?"" The acting is very well done, the cinematography is first rate, and there are some very genuine scares, but on the whole, this movie is just too complex and provocative to be utterly enjoyable. Make no mistake, this movie is definitely worth seeing, but it's nothing like what ads purport it to be."
3,'eh,"After the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I guess I was expecting.. well.. more. If you enjoy sitting down to a good movie that surprises you in the end - this won't be the one.However, if you enjoy a good solid movie that is telling a story of 'what would happen if', then you will probably enjoy Signs."
1,Ridiculous!!!,"This film was beyond bad. It's completely implausible plot, mediocre acting, self-righteousness, and excessive sentimentality were just too much for my delicate system. And, it was not the least bit frightening or foreboding! A complete waste of time. Watch ""War of the Worlds,"" a much more successful film in this genre."
1,Sighs,"I was hoping for this movie to be of better quality than Unbreakable. After seeing that movie, mister m-night-shalamar just looked like he could do the same trick (6th Sense) but worse. Well, I have to say, I was disappointed.Signs is a movie about a priest that's lost his faith with a side-plot about an alien invasion. The movie is slow which wouldn't have been a probleem if the side-plot didn't lead me to believe that more exciting thing's are about to happen. They don't. At the end all characters have some sort of Owen Meany type characteristic that's supposed to make the movie real smart. It doesn't.For me the movie would've been better if the whole alien invasion thing was just kept as a background layer and not much more.The acting by Mel Gibson is solid.The alien looks terrible (probably because budget was not allocated, because of the undecidedness what to make this movie)Go watch a better movie."
4,"Signs (I like it, i like it a lot!)","Yes, i said it. I liked it, signs is a great movie! It doesnt seem overly scary. Of course theres a few jumpy parts but nothing overly bad, what gets you is when you go out side at night after seein the movie.I like that the movie is based in a real place. Everything is always washington and new york. I like how it was placed smack dab in the middle of bucks county PA. I live right near bucks county,and near corn feilds, so that made the movie even better.I think the guys at did the casting deserve a pat on the back. Mel and the dude from gladiator did a fantastic job together...One thing i did'nt like though was the aliens. I think they messed up a little and its funny. How can a beast jump from the ground to the top of a roof, and break through a roof, yet it cant get out of a pantry and gets beat up by a guy with a base ball bat, odd."
3,"Good storytellng, but not terribly deep","This movie, which pits faith against coincidence, seems somewhat trite and wooden. Mel Gibson seems lost without Danny Glover, and his attempts to play a man with a crisis of faith seems a bit of a stretch. But the story is well put together, except for one aspect towards the end that I cannot discuss without spoiling it. However, if you view this as a story of faith rather than as an alien plot, it does OK although the plot with the aliens doesn't really hold water. The conclusion seems to be somewhat preordained.Despite this minor problem, the movie did keep me engaged throughout, even if the ending seemed a bit too easy."
5,An in-depth character study well done!,"Based on the theatrical previews, I was expecting more of a crop circle drama. Instead, I received something better. This is a great, thought-provoking movie. It is not for the weak-minded or the viewer just out for a fun flick to watch. Entertainment is great, but sometimes it is nice to have a challenge or two such as Signs. This movie questions the existence and relationship with a 'higher power' without being new-agie or overtly religious-specific. Gibson and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job of mystery, fear, faith, humor, and just plain acting. The director should be proud of doing such a good job with his limited film budget, awesome artistic cinematography, and production of Signs."
4,Mel saves the day,"Mel Gibson plays a fallen-away minister/farmer who is bitter after the death of his beloved wife. He is raising the kids with the help of his brother (played by River Phoenix). One day, crop circles appear in his cornfield, then in fields all around the world. They follow the news on the tv, but there doesn't seem to be any local law enforcement involved in the situation. Soon, Mel and family must hole up in the basement to escape aliens, but his son's medicine is up in the living room!...There is a lot of scary music and a lot of walking around in the dark...and we get to see two aliens. There is a subplot about spirituality and the death of his wife which save the day in the end. I prefer Mel Gibson as a romantic leading man, but he's ok as a father/farmer/minister too."
5,Sci-fi thriller with a twist,"This movie is mostly about us questioning whether there is life on another planet and questioning your faith in God all in one movie . It's a great movie for all members of the family , as long as they are old enough not to be afraid of a M. Night Shyamalan movie in general, as they can be a little frightening , but very interesting!"
3,All you have to fear is fear itself?,"The problem of UFO's and crop circles puzzles a lot of us.It is clear that calling every siting ball lightening or weather balloonsis no long going to cut it, when the government response is usuallyout of proportion to them being 'nothing'?Movies like this one that prey on fear are probably not really a good thing.The logistics involved in an interstellar invasion by aliens is such thatonly an empty planet is likely to be worth the effort needed.So even if Aliens exist with superior technology, it isn't likelythey are able or willing to invade...."
3,How is this scary?,"While the sixth sense was very scary, this one gave me absolutely no scares. It's actually a fairly good movie but if you're looking for a scary horror movie, this isn't scary. I mean, I was more scared in Panic Room than this.The plot is about aliens that are going to invade the earth. It's a good plot and a family tries to stop this and hide from it but this family also has its own problems. Well, it just wasn't scary at all. It was a descent rent but when I see, from the director of the sixth sense, I'm looking for something that's scary and this isn't. Rent it if you want to, but know that it isn't scary AT ALL!"
5,This cookbook is fantastic!,"This cookbook really encompasses some of my children's favorite recipes. The directions are short and easy to follow with bright pictures of the finished product to guide the children through successful baking. For my Kids in the Kitchen program that teaches children how to make healthy foods, this cookbook is great. It shows them the nutritional facts so they are responsible for what they put in their mouths. I have ordered this cookbook for 80 kids and have gotten great feedback from their parents on them actually cooking with it."
2,Not What I'd Expected,"From Better Homes and Gardens, I expected a more basic approach to cooking. This book is so busy with garish cartoons and unreadable fonts that the recipes themselves get lost. Not all kids are video game junkies who require constant visual stimulation. I gave the book 2 stars because, as promised, the recipes themselves appear to be good."
5,Junior Cookbook,This is a great cookbook for young girls and older girls alike. It contains lots of yummy recipies. I originally bought it for my granddaughter and then bought one for myself because the recipies are so good. Great job Better Homes & Gardens!
5,junior cookbook,"This cookbook is made for children. Has very colorful pages and catchy names for food to make. There are sections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, drinks, and desserts. My granddaughter spent the first hour I gave her the book just looking through it all. Recipes are very kid friendly!"
5,The Better Homes & Garden titile sealed the deal.,"this wonderful looking book has not been unwrapped or given to the young 8 yr old yet . . .she will be happy to get it since it was requested spiking a current, new interest in hanging around the kitchen :)"
3,"Too many prepared food ingredients, but ok other than that.","I gave this kid's cookbook only three stars because the recipes contained within rely too often on packaged/prepared food ingredients (canned soup, crackers, refrigerated dough, etc). I cook real food from whole-food ingredients and want my children to learn this way of cooking as well. The recipes that use whole foods are fine and kid appropriate."
3,Good basic book.,"I think this book is more suitable for teenagers. I always enjoy cooking with my 5 years old boy. So, I bought this book for more kids friendly recipes. The book has colorful pages, but the picture of the dishes were way too decorated. My boy asked why it looked different from the book. Also, this book has too many sweets, I would like to introduce more healthy eating habit. I thik I would use this book for ideas only and wait until my boy is older to let him use the book by himself."
5,Kids will love this book and Mom's too!,This book is great for kids. Foods that kids will eat and easy to prepare.
4,Fun Cookbook,"This book was purchased to continue a cooking class that I am doing with our children at home. Most of the cooking basics have already been taught, but I did appreciate the over-view of the basics in the beginning of this book. The recipes look fun and engaging, nothing too complicated, but most will require an adult to at least be IN the kitchen.My only complaint is that the first 5 pages (or so) were caught up in the spiral binding. I had to take much caution not to rip the page out as I was turning it. Once I got them all straight, they were great after that.Thanks for a great book!Happy Cooking!"
1,"Can you say ""poor food choice""?","It's hard to tell what's for breakfast and what's for dessert in this cookbook, which features cheese, sugars, oils and processed foods in dish after dish. For example, the 3rd recipe in the breakfast section entitled ""Monkey Bread Rolls"" contains prepared sweet-roll dough, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping and 1 Tb maple-flavored syrup. Skip this book entirely."
1,Poor Quality Check in Publishing,"I have to say, I was really excited about getting this cook book for the kids. I wanted them to start helping to pick out what we were having for our family dinners.I was even still excited about this when it arrived. I thumbed through the beautifully colored pages, saw some really great recipes and couldn't wait to use it.And then it happened. I saw 19 pages that were repeated. They didn't have page numbers on them like the first ones did. The publisher had screwed up and two whole sections were missing and replaced with a ""draft"" of a previous section.Needless to say I was very disappointed and have returned the book. I expect more from BHG and will not be buying from them again."
2,Such a cute cookbook for kids!,My 8 yr old Grand-Daughter just loves to cook. I bought her this cookbook (as well as an apron!) for Christmas. Already she has prepared supper for us twice! Such a cute cookbook for kids and its from Better Homes and Gardens test kitchen!
3,Unhappy,"I ordered this from Amazon so a couple of 9 year olds could cook during the summmer months while I was staying with them. I was very disappointed with the book. The recipes were really more on the order of how to make a grilled cheese sandwich, or how to put a taco together than hands on actual working with ingredients like flour, sugar, butter. It seemed like the authors were interested more in making a PRETTY book that an actual recipe book. The artwork was beautiful, but covered the whole page, very overwhelming. I would not recommend this book."
3,A little too silly for a 7 yr old who wants to be a serious chef.,"This is probably an ideal gift for a child who has a mild interest in the kitchen and a shorter attention span. Our son is almost 8 and he explicitely told us he wanted a cookbook for Christmas. He loves baking and has been telling us for 2+ years that he wants to be a chef when he grows up and own his own bakery. He was thrilled when he opened the cookbook and gave us the much-sought-after hugs and kisses. He sat down on the couch to read the cookbook. 10 minutes later we asked, ""Well, what do you think? Are you ready to cook dinner?"" He crinkled up his nose and said, ""Well, it's kind of silly. I'll still use it, and I like it, but I might just use your cookbook, Mom, when I want to bake something serious.""Ouch."
2,short on substance and photos,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. It is very slim, about sixty pages. There is very little text and the pictures are sometimes out of focus. This was supposed to be a present to someone, but I am too embarrassed to give it to her. I would suggest no one buy this book ""blind"" like I did. The search inside the book online did not portray how little substance the book contained and the poor quality of the photos."
2,In a Paris Moment,"The text is lovely, the pictures were somewhat disappointing. Cost is high for the value."
4,Carnie's book,"This book was a good account of Carnie's journey. It really needed to be edited. Some may argue that editing would take away from the 'real Carnie' that was so 'in your face', but I think that she could have gotten her point across in fewer words. The pictures were great and I have a great respect for her courage. Thanks to Carnie for sharing."
3,my review on the book,"I have to say that I read the book in two days. The only book I usually read that fast is Jackie Collins. The reason I read it so fast, was like Carnie I am looking into the suregry. I wanted to see what input she had on the suregry. Even thou, her input was quite there. Most of these things I already know.If you are interested in the suregry, I would do heavy research on the web and speak with people who actually had the suregry done. Yes Carnie had the suregry done, but most of the stuff she talked about regarding suregry is again, things I already knew."
5,Helpful,This book was right on the mark. It helped me make my desicion on this surgery. It was an inspiration to me. I could not put it down I read it in less than a week. It was also very helpful to have the question and in the appendix and have them answered by professionals in that field.
2,But what happened?,"I am pleased for Carnie that her jouney to weight loss was success! As a WLS candidate the book did not offer what I was looking for. I view the book as a biography of her journey not a tool for me to determine if this is ""do-able"" for a middle aged Mom who works out of the home and with children still in elementary school and two in college.I was disappointed with the use of the ""f"" word constantly in the book. I think the message and story could have been just as effective without the use of this terminology. I understand this is probably a part of who Carnie is but it was not encouraging to me and was a great distraction. I did not find the story had a lot of substance."
3,"Okay, Carnie, now stop whining","As a person interested in WLS, this book helped me make the decision to go ahead with it. However, there is a lot of ""extra"" crap in here that has nothing to do with WLS...how she is so horny all the time, the drugs, the whining, the vulgarities. Please. If this book was just for WLS, why include the other crap? Just make it about the WLS and reasons for it. Otherwise, market it as a plain ol' biography of a wannabe star.Having said that, I think Carnie was brave to put a public face on a previously barely-heard-of concept. Kudos to Carnie for that.A postscript...what will she name her next book? ""Oops, I did it again!""?"
4,"I""m not the only one with the same thoughts about one's self","I'm still reading the book, I read while I exercise on the bike.But I can relate to most of it so far. I am having the surgery sometime in April 2009. I can't wait to read the 2nd book ""I'm still hungrey""which I am always. The cookbook is also interesting especially the namesof the recipes how true they are."
3,Save your money.,"I found the book slow, dull, and repetitive, with no quality information. It is a good read as far as seeing someone else's struggle with morbid obesity, but not for trying to learn anything about the surgery itself. It tells of her struggles, reasoning for being MO, how she compares herself to others, all things that someone with MO is aware of. It was frustrating to read the same feelings and stories over and over; and, what I was most annoyed with was the tasteless and vulgar language throughout the book. Regrettably I bought her other book, ""I'm still hungry."" I am hoping that offers a look into what it is like years after the surgery, with good quality information, and devoid of the crude language."
1,Disgusting,"Once again, another hit for fat people and the 'wonder' of weight loss surgery. I am disappointed in the book, and the person for the obvious mutulation of a healthy and functioning stomach. Contrary to popular belief, and propganda (what this book is) for WLS, its a dangerous and overglamorized procedure, further 'glamorized' by Carnie Wilson."
4,very interesting autobiography,"I don't usually read autobiographies, but this is one I couldn't put down. Carnie was so open and honest about her life.Some people may find her language offensive, but if you aren't bothered by a certain 4 letter word, then you should be okay.This book will open your eyes to what Carnie and millions of other overweight individuals have to deal with every day. Her surgery was certainly not the easy way out. After the surgery it takes hard work and dedication to acheive the goal of weight loss. My only drawback in rating this book is that there is more of Carnie's story to tell. And since I am not interested in the surgery I found the Q&A section to be something I didn't need to read. If Carnie writes a follow up to this book, I will certainly take the time to read it.Buy this book if you are interested in Carnie, and/or interested in bypass surgery!"
3,A Real Life Journey,"An ""in your face"" style memoir by Carnie Wilson of her struggle with obesity and her eventual triumph through gastric-bypass surgery.Carnie recounts her life as a child, struggling to connect with her troubled father Brian Wilson. She points to several complex theories as to her history of weight problems and eventual addiction to marijuana.It's not a particularly well written book and the extreme use of expletives might turn some people off. At times I felt it read like an ""infomercial"" for Spotlight Health, the website that aired Carnie's surgery.What it is, is a refreshingly honest account of her frustration with not being able to control her life and the impact it made on those around her.In the end, Gut Feelings is an inspiring story about a young woman who finally overcomes her life threatening obesity and drug addiction with surgery, hard work and the love and support of her family."
4,Carnie's Story of Weight Loss Surgery,"The beginning of the book was a little slow, perhaps too much information regarding her personal life, family issues and such. However, after about a third through, things really picked up and then I couldn't put it down until I had finished reading it. She is refreshingly honest. The pictures were great of before and after. Interestingly enough, outside of the cover picture, my favorite picture is of ""her future husband"" the day they met, and the look in his eyes as he looks towards her. The fact that he is completely oblivious to the camera, is so revealing of his feelings about her, considering she was at her highest weight. It is wonderful that she met someone before her surgery, that came to love her unconditionally. Reading her story was quite informative of the personal aspects of this issue. The profanity was unnecessary."
1,Still waiting!!!!!!!!,"The worst experience yet!!! I ordered this weeks ago, never came, got an email that said they no longer had it in stock and it would be refunded. I go back on to order it from somewhere else and the one I had ordered was still processing. That was 2 weeks ago and I still dont have it. I am in the 5th week of class and still no book. Horrible service and I cant tell you about the condition because I DONT HAVE IT YET!P.S. This was a rush delivery as well!"
4,Good textbook,"I will have to admit I would have never bought this book other than is being for a school text book. It's one hell of an English book that covers just about everything, written, that you could imagine. I'm glad that I have it for future reference."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM,"Bought this album last year after seeing the video for the song ""In the Shadows"" on yahoo music. It was the only album I listened to for weeks, I just couldn't get enough, had to hear it over and over again. Their music is not too heavy or too pop.. it's just ROCK!"
5,Haunting!,"Not since I first heard Chester of Linkin Park belt out the lyrics to 'In the End' have I been this enthralled with a vocalist and band. The Rasmus' lead singer Lauri Ylönen's voice is nothing short of enchanting, as if it were an echo of a dream you can no more remember then forget.'In the Shadows', 'Guilty', and the profoundly beautiful 'Funeral Song' are brought to life trough Lauri's gravely vocal talents and furthered by the impressive bass, guitar and drum work. While 'First Day of My Life', 'Time to Burn', 'Still Standing', 'The One I love' are up beat fast paced leaders. 'Not Like the Other Girls' is reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven' with its powerful lyrics and epic sounding guitar rifts. Dead letters is by fare one of the BEST albums of the year and worthy of your money."
3,Goth?,"I don't really know why this band has been placed under the genre of goth rock, because they're pretty poppy. Overall, though, this is a pretty good album. ""In the Shadows"" is clearly the hit, while sleepers like ""Guilty"" and ""Not Like Other Girls"" make the album. Pretty good, although they are mainstream, but overall nothing phenomenal."
2,Mediocre at best,"When I bought this album, I really thought I was buying the newest release from the fantastic New Jersey band called Dead Letters...I didnt really realize that the name of this band was called Rasmus and that their album was called Dead Letters...Anyways, I didn't like it very much. Alot of the songs seemed to just drone on and on changing very little and incorporating some bad melodies with average vocals. I did like tracks 3 and 7 though."
2,THE HYPE CAUSES BIASED REVIEWS,"ok the hype surrounding these guys is huge.... why are they so biiig???? there really not that good..... simple hooks... cheesey lyrics... ""hot lead singer"" ha! i just answered my own question.... such an easy crowd to please...a fickle industry.. look beyond... please"
3,The Singer Looks Like a Pat,"Hi, I saw ""In The Shadows"" on MTV Asia (India) and I was like, is that a guy or a chick? It's Pat (remember SNL skit?). Anyway its listenable pop rock alternative (goth?, no but they have a goth look, escpecially Pat). Anyway, they will never make it in the US big, but that singer looks like Kelly Osbourne's double. You could listen to worse. BTW, MTV overseas is totally different than the homo agenda reality show and rap videos MTV in the States, its actually like it was in the early 80's playing mostly rock music videos. That tells me the American market is being manipulated to listen to rap or else Americans like rap and the rest of the world likes rock (I doubt that unless your a black American). I'm glad I don't follow trends and stayed true."
2,"Creed fans rejoice, theres a new poser in town...","and it's (band) name is ""The Rasmus""...Gimmie a break, these guys are about as ""hardcore"" as bingo night at the old folks home. The song ""In my Life"" is seriously the most annoying thing i've ever heard ""in my life"", and ""f-f-falling"" is f-f-freakin stupid. Chase cut, if you like stupid poser sell-out bands like Creed and Nickelback, then you'll LOVE the rasmus...What I Expected: Something cool, emotional and catchy...What I Got: Bon Jovi on Depressants..."
1,corperate effort from pop for the goth posers out there...,This is pathetic. Its pop with the lyrics of good charlotte. At least they are mildy punk. This is not 'gothic' or 'dark' as many of you are saying.This is for posers who want to be 'goths' to be different. REAL goth music has much more lyrics and technical variation - not the same chorus and drum beat throughout.POSER MUSIC - STAY WELL AWAY.
1,Nothing to see here....,"First of all..They lipsynch(I dont make this up just to make them look stupid, they already look stupid. I saw the singer lipsynch and it was very obvious+others have seen it too. That's the mainreason I don't really have respect for them. The 2nd is..I dont like the music). I think that is outrageous for a so-called rockband to lipsynch. I mean like..paying 20 euro to see them lipsynch? That's just a waste of your money AND time since the teengirls will give you angry glances for 'moshing'.But how is their music? Well..below average. Their songs are just 1 big cliche with 'oohs' and 'aahs'. And I think they're so much better bands out there than The Rasmus.And don't hate me for telling my own opinion, this is a review.By the way, I didnt mean to say that only teenagegirls like The Rasmus(well most of the fans who are female thinks he's 'hot' though he really is not)."
4,good cd,"this cd is great!! the lyrics and the music are almost perfect.. but they sing a few sad songs which is kind of depressing. Other then that my favorite songs are the one i love, still standing and in the shadows!"
5,the rasmus,"Until July, I had never even heard of The Rasmus. It was not until my English friend sent me the song ""In the Shadows"" that I ever heard one of their songs. I was immidiately hooked, and ran off to buy the cd. It's the most amazing album i have ever heard, and is completely unique. The music is brilliant with an edgy rock sound, but isn't too over the top. Each song is just as perfect as the first, and there really isn't any song that out shines another. It's a cd that you will listen to over and over, and each time it ends you'll want to hear it again. The Rasmus are strangely addicting, and I would suggest this album to anyone who is looking for a cd for every mood, feeling, and event. It's absolutely amazing, and I can't wait till The Rasmus finally tour America. :) So come on!!! Buy the cd!! :D You wont be dissapointed :)"
5,"BEST CD I'VE HEARD IN A LONG, LONG TIME!!",I first heard of The Rasmus while in Holland. I came home to S.C. and bought the CD right away. They are very talented and every song is wonderful. Lauri (the lead singer) is HOT!
5,very good,Este Cd es unos de los mejores en musical tropical este grupo desde Mexico trae todo el sabor tripical con un toque cumbia romantica lo recomiendo para los que les gustan la musica tropical como cumbia romantica.
1,...,"...After five minutes of it, the only thing that kept me from turning it off was sheer morbid curiosity. Nowhere in the entire video was there anything that was more funny than it was stupid. I literally don't remember laughing even once. I realize this sounds rather venemous but frankly, I'm ticked that I'm out the eight dollars I paid for this piece of wasted celluloid.When we finally got to the end of the tape, I reached over and hit the eject button on my VCR. My roommate said ""Aren't you going to rewind it?"", to which I replied ""Why bother?"", before picking the tape up, putting it back in its little sleeve and burying it in a drawer.If you want to see a good Star Wars gag, buy George Lucas in Love. That one's actually funny."
1,X-rated scene: NOT for Children !,"This DVD contains a video clip of a fully nude woman,and so should be rated R !I purchased: ISBN 094118847-7,the original collector's edition which said on the back that it was 1 hour long. It is more like 12-15 minutes long...with credits included."
2,Hardware Wars,"I don't know. I just didn't care for it that much. It had some funny moments, but overall, I just didn't find it that funny. I also expected it to be movie-length. Instead it was only about twenty or thirty minutes. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly was not one of my favorites."
1,This movie or should I say preview [is bad],The movie isn't a movie. Its a preview. It's only 20 minutes long for ...that isn't even funny. Its a waste of money and time in your life.
4,a classic,"If you are a fan of spoofs and Star Wars, then you should like this low budget knock off of a New Hope. Don't expect a 90 minute movie though. The run time is probably around 20 to 30 minutes. I was not a big fan of the ""special edition"" version of the film on the dvd, but thankfully the original Hardware Wars is intact on the dvd. Keep in mind that this review is coming from someone that has used a character name from this movie as a username for years...so I got blinders on."
1,waste of money,"I thought it'd be a good laugh to see the whole movie done this way. Not with this product. It a trailer mocking the 4th movie of star wars. Now i know this was going to be a movie mock up, that is why i bought it. But 10 min... forget it. Spend your money on something for useful like sidewalk chalk."
1,"Pork Lips, EVER???","I have not seen this DVD version, but saw the original on TV years ago and it was funny. This review is for the company releasing the DVD. From what I have read about this release, it only has Hardware Wars on it. Why not release a DVD with all the Ernie Fossilius parodies, such as ""Pork Lips, Now"", which is IMHO a better spoof of Apocalypse now, than Hardware Wars is of Star Wars. I would have definitely bought this DVD if it had at least the 2 spoofs, but will not for just one."
3,"If you like the original, you may not like this.","I was very disappointed by the ""Special Edition"" of Hardware Wars. I am a big fan of the original and felt the added computer generated effects were unnecessary and ruined the charm of the original's tacky atmosphere. It would have been nice if they had at least included both the original and special editions on the same tape. I booed, I cried, I kissed ten bucks goodbye!"
4,Useful for the 1L,"I read this book as a law student. When I look back on it now, it seems elementary, but I can't deny that it was helpful at the time. It gets the reader out of the mindset, which might be familiar from undergraduate coursework, of looking for the right answer to examination questions, and teaches the importance of finding ambiguities and handling them intelligently. The authors are right that this is an important habit not just for the student but for the lawyer.I do not particularly care for the style in which the book is written. It did not seem to me to assume an intelligent reader. But I know many classmates did not have this reaction at all, and found it very readable. Anyway, it's not supposed to be a book you read for pleasure. You read it because you are quite rationally in fear of law school exams. Help is not easy to find (the other books I've seen about exam-taking are not as good), and this book contains some solid advice on the subject."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you have taken a class on legal reasoning or even a basic logic class, you do not need this book. On the other hand, it is very readable and will quell some of your law school stress. You may be better off studying. For a good law school prep book look for Jeff Deaver's guide."
2,Maybe may not be enough,"I gave this book two stars for its discussion on addressing policy issues on the exam--this was helpful, indeed. It also gives good tips and provides answers to frequently asked questions on how to prepare--but this is standard advice you'll hear in any law school. Does this book provide a concrete strategy on handling a law school exam? No. In sum, it describes what is wanted on an exam, but doesn't come close to adequately showing students how to get to this ""maybe."" You are on your own..."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this before I went to law school and I felt it was a waste. You will be taught how you need to write in school to pass the exams, you don't need to read a book about how to do it. It is very simple, usually on your exams you have to show all sides rather than choose an argument, unless told otherwise."
4,worth your time,This book is a classic for a reason: it provides practical advice that can actually help you improve your scores on law school exams. I don't know of a better book out there on this topic (though there are many similar books on the market). I suggest reading this before you even start your first term in law school because the concepts discussed in the book--such as issue spotting--are useful (even necessary) to know before going to class you 1L year. I'd recommend this book to anybody attending (or about to be attending) law school.
5,An essential tool for law students,I am a law professor at the oldest night law school in San Francisco who has struggled for years to communicate to my stdents how to prepare for exams. I wish someone had told me about this book years ago. It explains cogently and distinctly why law school exams are different than those exams you did so well on in college (or you wouldn't be in law school) and why you need to start thinking differently. The book goes through the different types of questions one mught find on an exam and shows how to address them. It also provides numerous tips on how to study and how to approach exam writing. The book also does a great job of explaining a theme I have pushed for years --- that exam-writing skills are really the writing and thinking skills students will need when they become lawyers. It should be required reading in law schools. And it wouldn't hurt law professors to read the book either.

4,Great spicey table cheese,'A creamy cheese with a semisoft texture that contains small holes. Havarti is Danish in origin and has a mild flavor that sharpens with age. It is popular as a dessert cheese served with fruit and wine'
4,Non-Fiction Steinbeck ...with Ricketts,"If you intend to read Steinbeck's Sea of Cortez you can do it two ways. You can order this book, Sea of Cortez, and get the full benefit of Steinbeck and Rickett's exploration of the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez), or you can order the Log, which only contains Steinbeck's observations and color commentary, leaving out Rickett's technical information. If you are a fan of Steinbeck, the log is both entertaining and informative and pure Steinbeck in that he exhibits that meandering curiosity that began here (1941) but was still evident in Travels with Charley twenty years later. To get the full effect of the voyage, however, this is the book you want. This is non-fiction Steinbeck, so don't expect Mice and Men or Grapes of Wrath. Still, I read the whole Sea of Cortez more than two decades ago and had to come back and order both the Log and the entire Sea of Cortez, just to be sure I have it on my shelf again."
1,POS,part wasnt even the same size as original but put it on anyways cuz it did fit..turned on the jeep and nothing part didnt even work.
1,oli pressure sensor,It's not a direct fit. It doesn't plug into the factory wire harness connector very well. After installing the sensor it showed zero oil pressure. I re-installed my old sensor until I get down to the local auto parts store.
1,Be careful the description is misleading,"Be careful! This product description is deceptive. The light does not come with a battery. You must buy a separate sony camcorder battery, which costs twice as much as the video light, and then you have to buy a charger for it. The whole package costs well over $125. Moreover, if you try to return it, expect HUGE hassles. Amazon.com tells you to call officedepot, who tells you to call techdepot, who tells you to call sony, who tells you to call amazon.com, who then tells you to call some other company again, and on and on and on."
1,Where were the instructions on how to fly fish?,Please! The video was mostly women talking about the sport in very general terms! I learned very little about how to fly fish. Very disappointing! I could not recommend this video to anyone.
3,Just Alright,"Dave's Gourmet is probably the hot foods brand I hold in the highest regard so I was hoping that the Popcorn would be every bit as good as their sauces and Dave's Burning Nuts. Insanity Popcorn is spicy but without a lot of flavor. It lacks really much definition, its really buttery, or smokey. Instead its somewhat salty with a lingering heat. Its reasonably spicy but without insanely hot or great flavor (or both), its mostly novelty. On paper it sounds like a great idea but I don't think popcorn is probably the best delivery mechanism for hot foods sadly. Its not bad but its not great either. Other customers seem to love it to so buy and try."
4,Dat's Some Spicy Popcorn,"Got these for my dad for Father's Day and he liked them a lot. His eyes were watering, but he likes that kind of spicy."
3,good spice. o.k. flavor.,I had high hopes for this popcorn but it underwhelmed. It has nice heat but the flavor is a little boring. So far my favorite spicy microwave popcorn is the Pain is Good brand- hot. I've yet to try their two other flavors.
3,Tarantino UK style,"After reading many poor reviews, I wasn't expecting much of this film. I was pleasantly surprised by ""Circus"", however, though in all essence, it's a toned down Tarantino wannabe with a British accent. ""Circus"" tries to be the ever-popular hip gangster crime film that was popular a while back, but it falls short a bit. The problem seems to be with the incredibly complex storyline. There is a new twist in the plot nearly every scene, so much that it becomes anticipated after a while. The purpose of maintaining suspense through this technique is lost somewhere, and the ""unexpected"" surprise angles seem to be nothing short of a gimmick. Despite this, I found ""Circus"" to be somewhat enjoyable; it held my interest through its entirety. Keep an eye out for Eddie Izzard and John Hannah."
3,Take the road less twisted,"Too many plot twists add up to not caring much about what happens to whom. The actors are all decent to good, the script has its moments, and all in all this could have been better, I guess...somehow.Instead it's a mushy mess with no one to cheer for or care much about. It starts out rather ugly and violent but gets better as it becomes more character-driven. Even then, it's missing the snap and humor and pacing of Lock Stock and other successful films of the genre.Worth watching on late night tv if you can't sleep, maybe. Other than that, pass."
3,"EVERYONE SCREWING UP EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE MOVIE","Crime boss asks a hitman to run a casino. Everything's falling into place when we realize that there is much more to the story, a whole pageant of double-crossing, blackmailing, double-dealing and scamming going on behind the scenes. Far too complicated to care much about after a while.Logan spews out twist after twist, but we soon realise what he's doing, and so none of his tricks have the ability to shock us. The plot has low credibility anyway, because most of the characters' secret schemes are dependent on coincidence, guesswork and oodles of luck.What can I say. At least the film makes an attempt, and has ambition. It's better than the ads make it out to be, and if you really can't fight the urge to see a gangster film ""Circus"" is quite an alright feature. Oh, but it is NOWHERE near anything Guy Ritchie has ever lent his time to."
5,"Famke, a goddess!","Famke Janssen is the most beautiful woman alive and she looks drop dead gorgeous as a blonde in this interesting movie. The annoying brother from ""The Mummy"" is also in it and he's kind of funny. But, buy this for Famke."
2,I have two things to say about John Hannah,"I have two things to say about John Hannah.One: He should be in many many more films, because he is a fantastic and captivating actor.Two: He shouldn't have wasted his time with this particular film.And I shouldn't have either."
4,Alaskan Travelog,"This is a well done travelog of Alaska, with beautiful photogragh and narration by Charleston Heston. Anyone interested in ""The 49th State"" will find this a welcome addition to their film library."
5,Let the nature in your room.,Totally breathtaking piece of art. The very best art I have seen concerning given subject. Must have for anyone who can appreciate not only the beauty of nature but the very best of photography and sound combination.
3,"great photography, but NOT High Def","I really enjoy the visual beauty of Alaska in this film. But, this is in no way ""high definition"" It looks the same as the regular DVD (It's only $1 more, so not worth the hassle of returning)"
3,Not HD,"This is not a high-definition DVD (as already noted by another reviewer, the picture quality is the same as that of a regular DVD). That's a pity because the photography is great. While watching this disc I thought ""wow, this DVD would be great if it really were in high-definition"". Darn!"
1,WAY TOO SHORT...,Why on earth - espicially with Blue Ray - do these specials fail to go longer than 60 mins? I think this one struggles to make 40. Wait until it's reduced before getting it.
2,"Small Length, Large bucks","Tis is a short blu-ray movie that is somewhat interesting. Not much for the amount that blu-rays cost, however."
4,Another visual feast!,"I love nature and I love my high-end audio-video system...The IMAX series discs offer like minded people to get a trully awesome visual eye-feast.The narration by C.Heston fits the somber,harsh yet beautiful imagery of this DVD.I know some people complain that for the money its to short.However,the thrill of seeing such sharp,clear,pristine views in my view,makes up for it.And,until more networks broadcast true HDTV programs,this is the best us nature lovers can get!"
5,This True story is more exciting than any action movie!,A must read. Steson Kennedy tells the true story about his infiltration into The KKK of the forties and fifties in the deep south. This eye opening true story will keep any reader on the edge of their seat!
1,This duck sucks :-(,I ordered these based on the Flashy Quackers Duck Family Gift Set being waterproof. These do not appear to be waterproof. There is nothing that indicates that they are. Whoever heard of a rubber duck that you can't use it water? They are way too expensive to try it and find out.
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"I was satisfied with the Apex 1500, so decided to try the 1200 to save some money on a second player. Big mistake. After exchanging the first one, I brought a second one home which still didn't work. Complete waste of time. Will not play VCD/SVCD"
3,1 Year and still working,Yes this is a cheap dvd player in every sense of the word. I purchased mine on a long business trip and have been using it for about a year now. I use it fairly often to play home burned VCD and DVDs. I think I've gotten $40.00 of use out of it.
1,DVD playback flawed,"The MP3 and CD playback of this player are great, but its main function, DVD playback, is worthless. I have tried two of these players (did an exchange), and both have a flaw in which during DVD playback, the video constantly fluctuates from bright to dark, with increased saturation while dark. I know this is the fault of the player because the menu and ""screensaver"" modes do not present any fluctuation. Also, I made sure I was playing Region 1 coded DVDs to be certain of compatibility.Perhaps the store where I purchased the player received a bum shipment, and I'm not saying you shouldn't try it out yourself. Just make sure all the features work before you throw away the receipt."
1,DO NOT Buy this product!!,"First, it took me forever to get the stupid Player set up, but when I tried to play ANYTHING, I got a ""No Disc"" error. This is the first day that I have had it and it is fresh out of the box. This is TRASH and should be burned. Don't even waste your time driving to the store to look at it because it is AWFUL!"
3,"Good for the price, but you get what you pay for","My Apex worked quite well for a little over a year...there was some minimal problem with noise, but other than that it performed nicely. Then, two days ago, I got the dreaded 'no disc' error, which I have come to learn is the tell-tale death knoll of this particular machine. Ah well. It was good while it lasted, but unfortunately, that wasn't very long."
3,had a good run but now showing it's age,I've had mine for about 4 years and it's worked really well for the first 3. It does play everything you put in it. The remote is crap and you need to very close to it for it to register. I have also found that banging the remote on the chair arm works as well. The >> feature is great cause you can go up to 16x faster and go back as well. It is noisy when changing discs(holds 3 at a time) and takes some getting used to.Lately I have to pound it to get it to eject DVDs or open the door so I can put them in. I just got tired of having to bang on it to get it to open/close/stop making loud whirring noises. So I went out and bought a Philips progressive scan player which worked great for a couple weeks then started freezing on me whenever I tried to acces bonus features on DVDs.So I'm returning it and going back to my old Apex.
1,Can we say horrible??,This dvd player was purchased as an extra for a bedroom. It kept opening and shutting by itself and would not read any disc inserted in it. It also makes a loud noise when it opens and shuts. Needless to say it went back the next day.
2,Fatal flaw -- annoying motor noise,"I bought an Apex AD-1201, a nearly identical model as far as I can tell. I took it back because the motor made an annoying grinding, rumbling noise during playback of many DVDs. The playback would start out fine, but after 15 minutes the noise would start and get louder. Definitely a major distraction.Other flaws: noticeable lag in machine operations (play, menu etc.); 3-second lag between hitting the tray open/close button and machine response; cluttered, non-intuitive remote.Too bad, because the picture and sound quality seemed quite good for a unit at this price. But I just couldn't live with the motor growl."
3,Alright if you want something cheap,"We got this DVD player because it was cheap. It seemed to work alright (we had no problems with it at all and hookup was easy). However, as time went on, we wanted a little ""something more"". We were upgrading our surround sound system and TV, and this DVD player did not fit with those new plans. For instance, there is no component output for all six channels to be output separately - you only have the regular two RCA jacks and a coax output, so you can forget about taking advantage of component outputs. There is no digital optical output either. Finally, the remote leaves something to be desired. Aside from lacking some features, it's also very small and was misplaced a couple of times. Basically, if you're looking for cheap, this will work. If you're looking for something that will last a few years and will grow with your system, look elsewhere."
1,6-month rental,"The thing worked relatively well for about 6 months but it will no longer play DVDs. Audio CDs and CD-Rs of MP3s still work. From the beginning it had a one-second freeze in the display once or twice per movie. The default display is far too bright, making it difficult to even see the menu selections on some DVDs. You can adjust the brightness, but it resets with the next movie.I called APEX Customer Service and they suggested using a DVD lens cleaner or I could send it in for repair with a [$] labor charge."
3,...After 2 moths,"I bought this DVD player not only because it was cheap, but also the salesman told me that I will be able to play any DVD from around the world (Regions from 1 to 9) if I set this code 8421. He tried it in the DVD player AD-1200 and wow he was right!!! He also showed me the Macrovision function and I was quite impressed, but something is wrong with mine because I can play only DVD Region 1. Someone told me new ones have limits but I'm not sure. Other than that, it works ok."
1,Poor product,"I opened ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and my new Apex AD-1200 DVD player on the same evening and found that the machine paused the playback every 10 seconds or so. It made the movie unwatchable."
1,Apex 1200 GARBAGE!,I have to agree with other consumers that have purchased a Apex AD 1200 DVD player that this product should be recalled! I purchased one as a gift for my boyfriend and fresh out of the box error message reads no disc after loading! I purchased the item several months ago prior to giving it as a gift! So the warranty of 90 days has expired before using this product.I'm afraid after reading on this forum about customer service I fear that sending it back would be futal mand costly even though the parts are still under warranty. I wish I had seen this forum before purchasing! Lesson well learned! Future buyers BEWARE!!!
1,Apex AD-1200 DVD Player Is A Complete Peice of Junk,"I purchased this 3 months ago. The eject button never worked from the start then 2 months after VERY minimal usage it just stopped working. I sent it to APEX to get it fixed as per the warranty and 1 year later I am still calling them to get it fixed - they have the worst product and bad service to match. If you call their support number 909-930-1239 you can not get through over 80% of the time you have to keep calling.MY RECOMMENDATION STAY FAR AWAY FROM ANY APEX PRODUCTS THEY ARE JUNKI HAVE OWNED SONY AND PANASONIC PRODUCTS BEFORE DVD, VCR ETC. NEVER HAD A PROBLEM."
3,"Nice functions, but not very reliable","Owned the player for about 6 months, and it's already unable to read many DVDs. When it was new, it played everything, except for VCDs. Apparently, earlier versions played VCD, but later versions did not. Best feature for me was the ability to play a CD-R full of digital pictures from a PC. It just found all the files and played all the pictures as a slide show. The DVD video quality (S-Video) was only so-so."
4,Even cheaper at the store,"I went on-line and was already convinced about the price. Then I went to a [local] store and found it for [price]!!!! Can't beat this price (sorry Amazon folks :o)So far it is working fine. The box obviously has limitations (no display, limits to viewing 200 jpgs, the manual seems not accurate) but it does what is supposed to do. Oh, I also noticed a pause during DVD playback. Apparently it happens when there is a layer change in the DVD. But I can leave with that.I also suggest a look at this website: [URL]Lot's of interesting info about apex products.Cheers"
1,Terrible product,"In the specifications of the product says that this can read format VCD / SVCD and it is not this way, this product is a farce, it is of terrible quality."
1,It BROKE in eight months!,"The machine was finnicky from the beginning, often dissasociating the picture from the sound, and then suddenly it refused to work at all. Now whenever I put in a DVD the power turns off a few seconds later. Do not buy this product."
1,CRAP,"THIS IS THE WORST DVD PLAYER I HAVE EVER SEEN.MORE THAN 60% HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THE STORE WHERE I WORK.THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THE PRICE.SAVE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND SANITY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
4,Fine for what I use it for,"Somewhat like some of the other comments this player is working well to play a movie two or three times a week. It plays the CD's through the stereo TV adequately as well. The kids have managed to dislodge a spring that pulls the door closed and I may have to give some thought to opening the cabinet and resecuring that. Until then I will just give the door a flip and close it manually. I generally agree with the comments of ""you get what you pay for"". However, if your six year old knocks it off the shelf it won't survive regardless of how much you pay for it. I feel somewhat the same about furniture at this point. Grape juice is unaware of how much the new sofa cost."
1,What a piece of junk!!!,"You get what you pay for people. I bought this very large ""paper weight"" about a year ago and it basically is garbage now. Gets stuck in the middle of movies making it impossible to enjoy a DVD. And tonight I tried loading BRAND NEW DVD's and it basically wouldn't load them.You'd be better off lighting your money on fire versus spending it on this piece of garbage! STAY AWAY FROM APEX PRODUCTS!!!! VERY CHEAP!!!! GARBAGE!!!"
2,No navigation buttons,"It was really [reasonably priced] at Circuit City, and I like the fact that it will read anything, but after 8 months the remote isn't talking to the machine. Either the remote is busted or the sensor on the machine won't receive signals. Unlike the slightly more [spendy] Apex, this one has no navigation buttons on the front (nothing but play, eject and on/off), so if the remote disappears or stops working, you are sunk. Spend more money and get navigation buttons."
3,If Only the Remote Worked Better!,"I love this machine, but jeez! The remote control is driving me crazy. It takes on average 8-9 attempts to get it to pause, rewind, fast forward, etc., then once you're in that gear, another round of punching and aiming to get it to stop. I'm going to try a universal remote after the holiday and see if that works any better. If so I'll come back and amend this review."
3,Average!,"This is definitely a starter DVD player. The first one worked out well for a couple of months before the dvd went into the player. Now, the replacement has a different problem - the picture goes bright and dull often. I wonder if it has something to do with macrovision software."
1,Not worth the money,"The player started making vibrating sounds less than 2 weeks after we bought it. The problems that followed included freezing, not recognising that it had a disk, and then finally not working at all. All of this took four months. The only good thing is that I will get my money back to buy another brand."
4,A masterful rendition of an heroic and grimy story,"Spartacus is all of us when threathened in our human dignity, in our right to live, when we think we must fight oppression,the menace of terror and the tyranny of corrupt men of power. The Spartacus in this book is not as scintillating as Kubrick's Spartacus. He's more grim, much more conscious of the problem of restraining, in the rebellion to the tyranny of terror, the temptation of wreaking even more terror, and to give vent to the less rational and more violent and predatory instincts in human soul. Koestler's book poses problems who are far from resolved in the wake of the death of ""the God that failed"", of Communism. His questions are today's questions.Besides that,this is one of the more rigorous historical books I've read, and even if some speculations are a bit hazardous,they are entirely plausible.A good historical novel,"
3,Ronald Friend U.S.,"The Guitar music isnt bad, having Julieta Venegas and Paulina Rubio on the DVD made the purchase more worthwhile. I hope they call me on my Birthday in November."
3,a book with epic sweep,"I disagree with Mr. Milbratz! As strong as the whole of this wonderful book is, I thought the first 200 pages were the strongest, precisely because of their depersonalized, epic sweep. It requires a great degree of talent for a writer to make this kind of information not only coherent but gripping, and Reader does - weren't you fascinated by all that speculation on exactly how proto-humans exploited the heat of the African midday? Well, even if you concentrate on the latter portions of the book, we're still left with a stunning piece of nonfiction, I thought."
4,Reader interested in Africa,"I purchased the Book Africa a Biography of the Continent. This book gives a very a very complete back ground on Africa to included geography and formation of the continent. I have not finished reading the book but, will certainly appreciate the knowledge that this book contains. In the last two years I have made 10 trips to Africa for work and certainly appreciate knowing more about what makes Africa what it is today. Erin H. Milligan"
2,"Okay, but not the best book on africa !","I bought this book thinking that it be a new look at africa ,but after reading it, i saw that it was a lot like many older books on africa,althought seemingly presented in a new way.To me it seemed a bit dated and some of the information will be grabed by those who hold on the old traditional view of africa although i don't get that necessarily from Mr Reader himself.My dissagrements with this book are many, but seems that mr reader forgot that egypt was an africa civilization, and other races benifited from contact it and despite popular opinion, egyptain civilization came from the south, not the east."
4,easy to read,"This is a long book about Africa, that is nevertheless very interesting all the way through. It comes in two broad sections: the first part talks about the geology of Africa and about how people lived in relation to the land and how they survived there. This part is about people who lived with no (or very scarce) written records. It's done very well. Reader is very knowledgeable about the most recent theories and discoveries in human evolution . It's relevant, of course, to the history of the world and not just Africa. The second part is about what happened once Europeans and other types headed back in to Africa. This part reads a bit like a news summary. It's interesting, it's detailed (horrific in places), and it's only part of the story. That's fair enough, though. Goodness me, you can't have everything in one book. My position was: I know nothing at all about Africa. I need to start somewhere. This was an excellent book for that purpose."
4,College Book,This was one of the college books I order this semester to save myself some money on books and it arrive in great condition. I am very please with this book!
2,It's not too bad,"If this was my first book about Hatshepsut or about ancient Egypt I would have probably loved it. But I am a big fan of Pauline Gedge and I have read her ""Child of the Morning"", which was much more interesting and more historically accurate. My advise, if you want to know more about Hatshepsut, pick up ""Child of the Morning"" and avoid ""King and Goddess"""
2,"Decent, but nothing I'd reccomend.","The idea of this book is wonderful, but in the end, it just didn't pan out. If this book had actually been true to history, I might have been able to overlook the slight lack of skill in its writing, but that just was not possible. Romantic fantasy and made-up nonsense fill Tarr's interpretation of the tale, and it is obvious from her depictions of everyday Egyptian life and ideals that she has never truly studied the subject. The orders of the characters' deaths, proven by archaeological evidence, is not even correct, as well as the character of her husband. I urge anyone interested in Hatshepsut or Egypt to read about this fascinating subject, but choose a more worthy and accurate book to spend your time on."
2,"Flat characters, predicatible, not historically accurate","I think if you are going to write about a historical person, even if that person lived some 4000 years ago, you should try to research the person and the era. Like many of the other reviewers this book suffers when compared to Pauline Gedge's beautiful recreation of Pharoaoh Hatshepsut's life: ""Child of the Morning"" which is so much more believable and so much better written. I was willing to see what another author could do with the story, after all, we don't know too many details about her life, only that she was the only female Pharaoh, a really unimaginable feat for that or any era in history! and she ruled for 22 years, and most likely had a commener lover named Semenket...but Ms Tarr did not pull it off at all in my opinion. It was not believable, I did not feel as if I was there."
2,Not That Great..,"Judith Tarr's version of Hatshepsut's life is more fictious than Pauline Gedge's in ""Child of the Morning"". If you are interested in learning more about one of the greatest women that ever lived, avoid ""King and Goddess"", I suggest picking up ""Child of the Morning"" by Gedge. This version is more historically correct and doesn't build up as much an the strange facts that are known about Hatshepsut..."
4,The story of Pharoh Hatshepsut.,"I think this is a really good book. I have had a passion for Egypt sence I was a little girl, and always found the story of Hatshepsut very intresting.I love this book because all the charactures in this book actually lived during the time of Hatshepsut. And all the events in this story could have actually happend like this.Who ever out there like's the Story of the Queen who made herself king will love this book."
5,Great Characters!,"I really like the story and characters in this book. It's not always hugely engaging, but the characters always seem very vibrant and real to me. Its a wild ride of politics and crowns - everyone seeking to serve themselves while still forced to serve those above them in rank. I liked the development of Maatkare Hatshepsut (even though I often didn't actually like her) from a petulent child to a powerful king dealing with a potentially dangerous world around her. I hope to read more by Judith Tarr!"
2,Big Disappointment!!!,"As cute of an idea this house is---what a mess! Glitter everywhere, not child friendly at all. My daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas and was quickly frustrated and disappointed by how this thing operates. I'm not sure what they had in mind when they designed this thing but glitter winds up everywhere and quickly comes off the very tiny pieces. Not to mention the whole line of rubber clothes rips after a few uses. Save some cash and your child's frustration and avoid the purchase of this toy!"
4,FOUR STARS FOR THREE WWII MOVIES.,Three really good WWII movies at a really great price. Disc and transfer of the prints were fine. Really great dvd bargain...triple win for the buyer. Burma and Go for Broke in B&W..Never So Few..color.
1,"Good Movie, awful transfer","This is a very good WW2 film and one of the movies I used to see on late night TV many moons ago. This DVD, however, really is an awful transfer. Small, low def picture with a very low frame rate. Youtube videos have better resolution than this. It looks like it was ripped directly from a bad VHS transfer. Really a shame that a good movie like this has to be saddled with an indifferent DVD production. I higly recommend the movie itself, but suggest finding a different transfer and company or a buddy with the movie."
4,Go For Broke,"I bought it because my husband fought with the Japanese Americans during WWII,and he wasinterested in seeing the movie again, however, the quality of the CD was not very good."
1,Extremely poor picture quality--out of focus,"Extremely poor picture quality--out of focus-.plane pure garbage... I did not have a chance to write a full review- but I did buy another DVD, and it was excellent"
4,Good 1951 vintage WW2 movie: Great Subtext!,"OK,the movie dates back 50 plus years, so don't expect ""Private Ryan"" verisimilitude levels.Go For Broke is a dramatization of the real world 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a US Army infantry unit composed of Japanese-American enlisted men and white(""Haoli""to the troops)officers.Van Johnson stars as a freshly minted 2nd.Lieutenant who has to have his butt saved by his Nisei soldiers before he can see past their ancestry.Actual veterans of the 442nd played some of the troops;Shakesperian actors they ain't but it beats putting makeup on a white guy (vis.Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffanys).Try to spot John ""Sgt. Schultz"" Banner as a German officer who asks if he has been captured by Chinese troops. I like ""Go For Broke"" enough that it goes in the ""I watch it a lot"" stack next to the Humphrey Bogart version of ""Sahara"" and ""Battle of the Bulge""."
3,Go For Broke,"A very good ""old time"" favorite war movie. I know the acting wasn't the greatest but still the movie has its moments. A movie worth buying and viewing when cable t.v. run the same movies over and over again. Thanks."
5,"""There Are No Accidents""","This is an age old tale set in an ancient village in the Himalaya. The old village chief insists on waiting to take a yak caravan over the mountain on the specific date given by the oracles. A young whippersnapper, Karma, who would like to take over the Chief's role sooner rather than later, insists on leaving immediately before the weather turns foul. Both are stubborn, insistent and unmoving in their decision of when to leave. Both can't be correct or can they? This is a contest between each man and the mountain and everyone wins, because ""there are no accidents"". A breathtaking film cinematically and one that echos the spirituality of the Tibetan people. Bruno Coulais' soundtrack for this film is absolutely perfect. Eric Valli's direction is amazing considering the cast are not actors. This movie will stay with you for a very long time."
3,"Real People, Rugged Place","The film, set in a remote Himalayan village in Nepal, is gorgeous start-to-finish, a labor of love by those who made it over a long period of time. The cinematography gets a lot of good ""press,"" and rightfully so, but what I really enjoyed was the soundtrack. I expected the good visuals, and got them, but I didn't expect such wonderful music.As for the look, it's different, with rugged barren mountain village terrain and snow-topped Himalayas in background. What's really different, however is the fact the film employed no professional actors. These were real people of that area! They are fascinating faces you won't soon forget.As for the story, the treks don't begin until 45 minutes hav gone by in the film. You have to be patient. I's an adventure story that will reward you if you can hang with it that three-quarters of an hour. It also will make you grateful you weren't born in this part of the country."
4,"Stunning epic, but 30 bucks?","I have been an avid hiker and armchair mountaineer for a decade, and have read many accounts of Tibet and Nepal, so was jazzed to see some of the austere beauty. The story is wonderful, the scenery SPECTACULAR!, the acting very good. But with S&H, this costs $30--way too much. If it was Cliffhanger, Caddyshack, Butch Cassidy, etc. (the kind of movie you watch 4 or 5 times a year), I could understand the price. I will watch this movie perhaps another 3 times in my life, probably to introduce someone else to it. Great movie, but rent it if you can."
5,Fascinating and gorgeous!,"The scenery in this movie is spectacular, the cinematography is excellent.The movie introduces a civilization known to only a relatively few people.It reveals a way of life that is fascinating.The movie has tension and suspense and conflict as well as lovliness.Anyone who appreciates beautiful and interesting films...and doesn't mind subtitles...will love it.I forgot that I was reading subtitles within the first five minutes!"
4,True to Dolpo,"Having travelled to Dolpo (the location of this film) and lived there for roughly three weeks, I can tell you that this film very accurately portrays the surroundings and the people. I've trekked with salt traders, and met several of the ""actors."" Eric Valli and his crew weren't as good to the area as it was to them, but the outcome of the film can give an outsider a feel for this Tibetan culture high in the mountains of Nepal."
2,Yuck!,This game totally [stinks]. It's all jaggy and the controls are slow. There isn't even anything remotely close to a story behind it. In fact if it didn't have liner notes I wouldn't know why anyone fought. There aren't any movies at the end or anything. Basically there isn't any reason at all to play this game. Tekken tag and DOA2 are WAY better...
3,This game is alright,"This game is okay, nothin special. The graphics are amazing, yes but the single player value is absolutly horrible. This game should only be played with two people. This game doesn't even compare to ""Street Fighter 2"" on SNES [for all you hardcore gamers out there :)]. I say again, dont get this game unless youre playin w/ two people."
3,Great fighter that needs some more modes to play,"Virtua Fighter 4 is a very good fighting game and one of the best on PS2,but it could use some more gameplay modes!The graphics and sounds are top notch and the gameplay is fun for awhile,too but it neeeds some more interesting modes.Kumite just didn't satisfy me.It also needs some ending movies like the Dead or Alive and Tekken games.Still, for $19.99 fighting fans should buy it."
4,Pow bam boom!,"What a difference a version makes. VF4 is awesome and provides some of the most challenging gameplay. I would have given this game a 5 star rating, but its graphics aren't quite up to par with some of the other fighters such as Tekken Tag. FIGHT!"
4,Not bad at all !,It's actually a pretty good kick'em and throw'em game. A tad limited on character selection but the moves are impressive and the combos are also very good. Tekken still rules as far as I am concerned but Virtua Fighter is a good title to own if you like these kind of games.
2,this is by far the worst video game ive played,"I am a huge Virtua Fighter fan, and playing this game is really depressing. Ive been playing virtua fighter 1 2 and 3 for almost my whole life, and I'm 16 now. But this game really did blow. The game play is not at all like 1, 2, and 3. The backrounds were depressing to look at, maybe this game was good in the arcade, ive never played it in the arcade before.The graphics were seriously horrible, the reason why I gave it 2 stars is because the close up's were really good graphic wise. The reason why so many people gave it 5 stars is because they never even played this game on the playstation 2. So if you only played a video game in the arcade, or haven't played a video game before don't write about it, i can't stand kids like that get a life!"
1,i HATE this game!,"there is absolutely no story line! there is only one secret character to unlock!this game doesn't even go par with Tekken 4(great game Tekken 4 is!)you are trapped in a little box or your on a little spuare where you always get ring-out.you get to get items to put on your character but,that makes them look ugly."
1,"So Boring,Its more painful than the fighting.","No wonder wwhy this game went to greatest hits so quick.Their are no story lines, confusing moves,and it is practically impossible to beat the game on Kumity mode. If you like fighting games, Get Tekken Games."
2,"Trust me, wait for Soul Calibur 2","I have a Dreamcast with Soul Calibur and was hoping VF4 would hold me over till Soul Calibur 2. Big disappointment. I guess it's an okay fighter (not a huge fighter fan), but compared to Soul Calibur it's:1) Too slow2) Not very flashy. The graphics aren't quite as smooth as the ones on the Dreamcast.3) Less intuitive.I was expecting more based on all the reviews I read. VF4 just doesn't cut the mustard. For instance, the characters take up the whole freaking screen. Leaves less room to manuever around leg attacks.On the plus side, the AI mode is cool. Making your own fighter would be a great add on for Soul Calibur.I wish I had waited for Soul Calibur II."
2,Boring Game,"This is by far one of the cheesiest fighting games that I have played. It is the exact same game as any other Virtua Fighter, it simply has more characters. It is exceptionaly frustranting because it does not let you continue after you lose to Doral. If it takes you a half hour to get to the Bonus stage and you get your clock cleaned in two rounds you have to start over from the beginning. If you like to play a game that lacks in challenge until you fight in the Bonus Round than this is the game for you."
3,Just like all the others...,"I'm still waiting for someone to come out with a fighting game that will take the gameplay to the next level. This is no better and no worse then DOA2, TT, and the others. Just different characters."
1,Virtua fighter 4,"This game (stinks)! It is so easy and the graphics aren't that good, I even beat this game on very hard. ..."
1,Nothing new here,"It seems the only purpose this game was created for was so the company could make more money. There is absolutely nothing new with this game. It's pretty much of the same old thing, and this game gets boring rather quick. Just skip this one, there is always hope for Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, that game looks sweet!"
2,Why so much hype?,"Today, I went to the nearest Hollywood Video to look for a game to rent. I saw Virtua Fighter 4 and said, 'Wow, it's here. This is supposed to be great."" I took it home, played it for fifteen minutes with my brother and shut it off. OK, maybe 20 minutes. But still, I don't like it because, unlike Dead or Alive the fighters move soooo slow. I mean sure, they can dodge and do moves fast. But the combos are hard and they [stink]. Plus, the graphics are weird. Yes, they are good, but weird at the same time. In Dead or Alive the characters could do back flips and spins and about six punches and kicks in the same combo but it's not like that in VF4. I don't see why it got such a good rating. It has no story, the training mode is bad, and the acting is cheesey..."
1,worst fighting game for ps2,this game is so bad i'm almost sick. take my advice dont wast your time with this and buy tekken 4.
2,I was expecting better,"I was expecting a much better game, especially after all the hype this game recieved. I play fighting games a lot, in my opinion this game was too slow, and the fighting just did not flow like i expected it to. ...Yes I like Tekken and have played 4 in the arcades, and it was more fun to play and have to pay ...to play then have payed ...for VR4 and having it stinking up my game cabinet."
3,good for fighting game lovers,"awesome pace, varied characters and stunning graphics are all good but the problem I had with it was that there were not enough modes. After arcade mode that left me feeling kind of empty because I did not get an ending to the intruiging stories of the characters all I had was Kume mode which I felt was a little funner than arcade but not enough to make me keep playing. There is also the AI function where you can make a computer character learn your style but there is no guidance in the manual for assistance to go about doing this. Once I figured it out I found myself bored after I had taught my character and did not know what to do with it because watching it play the game was about as boring as counting blades of grass in a football field. My suggestion is to look for a game with more replay value unless you like fighting games more than anything else."
1,Please don't waste your money on this...,"This game is sooooo boring! The kumite mode goes on forever and you don't get anything! The characters are okay and so are the arenas, but they could be a lot better."
5,Best Fighting Game Ever Made.,"1. ...If you love martial arts this is the game for you. When I played this game for the first time I was so amazed how each fighting techinique was shown. Yu Suzuki really out did himself. People who have patience to master Virtua Fighter 4 will definitly see their gaming skills grow.(This is a fact!)2. The one thing that makes VF4 stand out amoung the rest is the A.I. Training Mode. You get create, that's right create, your own custom fighter and teach it new techiniques. Think of it as a giga pet kind of thing.3. The graphics are one thing you should not take for granted in the game. Let's just say it's pretty.4. Well, I hope you have enjoyed my review. All this was facts about the game. No opinions."
4,great balance in fighting...but.,"it has almost every thing arcade vf fans would wanthey ,me my self and vf ? we go back to the early 90sit was sensational ,revolutionary back then...but since ps2 is my first console machine and iwasthrilled to get my hands on vf4 guess what...29inch LG progressivetv i have ...seems to reproduce tekkens pro-gressive mode very nice... but the sophisticated moves andfeel of vf4 seemed to be burried by the less optimem graphicsof vf4...if vf 4 has progressive compatibility it would be quitesweet. but at this time what i can say for sure is ,if u want to kick...at arcade practice at home with vf4.and vf4 evolution is already out in japan and graphics hasevolved with many other features...but when it comes to simplefighting well balanced joy...buy it ,you have nothing to lose.i gave 3stars because of the graphics otherwise 5."
2,Great graphics but not VF,"I've been a fan of the Virtua Fighter games since the original arcade, this one the took a sorry jump into left field. multilevel fighting stances... kewl but not effective with the Virtua Fighter title. The graphics were among the best I've seen in fighters but I was just not impressed with the way that they tried to make Virtua Fighter into Tekken. If you're a fan of tekken style fighters you might want to check it out but if I want tekken I'll go with Tekken not Virtua Fighter. What can I say I like the orginal Virtua Fighter(s) and it is my belief that they bombed the series with the changing of the fighting system."
4,Classic Fighter,Virtua Fighter 4 has the perfect combonation of funny characters and classic gameplay. The gameplay is incredibly deep once you get into it and the game is like something else. Since it's a greatest hits title there's no excuse not to pick it up.
4,no more than any other fighting game,"I really don't see why websites can rate this game in the 9's. It's graphics sure beats most, but that seems to be the only catergory it excells in. i think i just may be the only one who dosen't give ""pity 9.3's"" just cause it's a fighting game. Dead or Alive however, earns each of it's five stars and problably more. In this game the music's barely ""okay"", the sound effects seem weak, no real sense of power. One of the worst things about this game is that you can win a fair amount of your matches just doing the same three-hit punch combo (which practically everyone has). And some moves, seem near impossible to do once, and impossible pereod to do consistently. This game MIGHT be worth the twenty bucks. i was one of the more unfortunate to pay fifty bucks for it."
4,"Great game, hard to execute attacks.","Virtua Fighter 4 is the first game that I have played in the series and it is an awesome game, but I think that the attacks are very hard to pull off and you would probably need a great deal of training to memorize the big attacks and when to use them. I would recommend this game to people who are good at pressing the right buttons quickly, cause if you don't press them fast enough, your character will not execute the desired attack."
3,"Virtua Bore, Did they even try?","This game lacks interesting features and unlockable content. That and the lack of good character development leads this game to such a negative reaction. With games like Tekken 4 and Mortal kombat DA to compare to this, it seems like Sega dropped the ball on this series in this installment. Bottom line, needs more characters."
3,Good but.....,"First off I have enjoyed playing this game, but I've owned it for one day and have already beaten the game with half of the fighters! I disagree with other reviews here in the depth of the game play. Like the previous versions of this game if you just punch constantly you'll win. As far as I can tell no hidden characters. Still, great graphics and it has been fun just not great. Buy Dead Or Alive 2 or Tekken Tag, much better."
2,i dont like fighting games,"yaaa, i dont....fighting games dont entertain me for long...probaly because i never have anybody to play them with..i played this game by myself but could never figure out how to work the ai thingy...i tryed and tryed..never could figure it out..."
2,Hour glass,I bought a 36 inch GoFit red foam roller and I loved it but itturned from a cylinder to an hour glass revolved around itslong axis! This happened after 1 month use. It did notregain its original shape. It was great while it lasted.How can I use it now?
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"I GOT MY FOAM ROLLER LESS THAN ONE WEEK AGO, AND IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PRODUCTS! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING ONE OF THESE IF YOU HAVE SORE/TIGHT MUSCLES. THE VIEDO IS BRIEF, BUT IT COVERS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE THE PRODUCT. I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING A ROLLER WITH THE VIDEO UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH USING THE PRODUCT. I WISH I HAD GOTTEN ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO!"
4,Great Roller!,This GoFit 36-inch roller is great for self muscle massage. The accompanying DVD shows a number of ways to get at each muscle group. Worth the investment. Sue G
4,A firm foam roller,"This foam roller is slightly harder than the basic white ones I have used earlier. Still not so much so that it would be too painful, or harmful. I have not had time to watch the attached dvd, have been following a physiotherapists instructions.I gave 4 stars because I have had this for a few weeks and don't know how it will wear. Neither have I checked the dvd.I recommend using foam roller to anyone who wants to take care of their sore and/or stiff muscles. But please, do follow instructions."
3,good but needed it to be bit more hard,I have a lower back injury so I use it to massage my back and legs. It is good but if it was harder then what it is then it would have better. It is hard but it is not as hard as I would like. Also it is too expensive for a foam roller but I paid more because amazon is not selling a lot of these in this particular shape and size.
5,Simple and Classic,"A simple story of first love. The memory of it has stayed with me for over 30 years. How often can you say that? How wonderful to find it still exists. This book will take you back to a time when love didn't seem so complicated. Although written decades ago, it still tugs at your heartstrings."
3,Visibility,I like the watch very much but it is very difficult to read in a low light / shady place without pressing the back light button and that can be a pain to do all the time. There should be some way to make the number brighter without pushing that button.
5,Prompt and Great Condition,This item arrived promptly and in great shape. I was very pleased and will order again.
1,...... Out everwhere in the world!!!!!!!!!!,"WTH happend microsoft! They knew this would happen, and didnt produce enough xbox 360s. Even the pre-orders wont be fufiled until early 2006! Crap on them, thanks a lot, ruin a kids dreams."
1,Big Disappointment,Xbox 360 is really Xbox 1.5....The graphics are no better than the current games on your home PC. The console has MANY problems. It crashes just like a Windows PC! I mean get real. Consoles are supposed to just play games and never crash. I have never seen a Playstation 2 crash. This is insane! The Xbox 360 is also overheating and having system errors.Microsoft products are dangerous. A woman almost died recently because her Xbox caught fire due to a defective power cord. If you buy one of these make sure you turn it off if you leave the room. It really is dangerous not to.
4,Good flexible cutting board,"Does what it is supposed to, just wish it washed up better in the dishwasher, it is starting to fade out."
5,Absolutely the best work on steps to build high self esteem,"This work has changed my life in ways that are too numerous to count. I encourage anyone reading this review to purchase the tapes - you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. When you feel good about yourself, there is nothing that you cannot do. Jack Canfield is an amazing, caring teacher who guides you through steps that, if followed, will ensure high self esteem. These tapes are universal for all ages and walks of life...."
5,Really Nice Boot !!,"Loved this boot from the first time that i saw it .. This was a hard boot to find, everyone was out of stock with my size .. But i found it on here .. Thanks for having it ... This boot is very comfortable to wear, and it looks awesome... Looks better in person than on a web page .. You want go wrong with this boot, if you like snake skin boots ..( Giorgio Brutini Men's Genuine Snake Skin Look 15549 Boots,Undyed Natural )"
5,Different style,"( Foreginer, english not good )It's the question how much Koczalski's soft style will attract your attention. It has some weak points, for instance left hand playing could be criticized.But he was admired during his carrer, before II W.W. And his interpretations of ballades are great in my opinion.They are flowing all the time, moving forward with tension hidden under poetic melody. Effect: fourth Chopin's ballade lasts 8:14! I heard the opinion it's reduced here to another waltz, I strongly disagree. In my opinion he exhibits here very well the modifications of the main theme and play it better then it is usually played.Polonaise is worse for me.This recording will give you bigger scope of how can Chopin be played, but don't buy it as a patch for hole in your Chopin collection."
4,A fine album from a blues-rock master.,"Solid album from an amazing guitarist.I had the pleasure to open for Walter at the Sturgis, South Dakota Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Races & Rally in August 1998. He played some awesome guitar!I really liked the blues and blues-rock stuff the best.Did I say he's a great guitar player?? Walter,as we say in Texas,""you got it"".Keep up the good work!!!"
1,Stuck in a rut.,"My first purchase of a Trout CD. If not for one major annoyance, I would have given this at least four stars. The problem? This guys solos are stuck in a rut. Each song starts off solid with a bang, but when the solo comes and the hammer-ons/pull-offs are piled on top of another, it ultimately becomes unlistenable. Eventually, you begin to realize that all the solos sound the same and take their toll on the overall project. It's a shame, because overall the group has a good sound and Trout has a fine Strat tone. This CD had potential. Unfortunately, Trout hasn't quite figured out that sometimes less is better.Lee Hagen Delafield, WI mhagen1@wi.rr.com"
5,What More can you say - first class as usual!,"This is another classic Walter Trout album. The title track is a first class start to the album and it just gets better. Enjoy track 6 ""through the eyes of love"" - This is Trout showing a lot of control on the guitar with a definite Santana bent! A must for all blues listeners. Can I also recommend Walter trout Live ""No More Fish Jokes"" Its a 1992 release which is well worth a listen."
4,Earthy Rock & Blues..,"walter trout uses tempos of rock and blues to give a cd to listen over and over, his guitar work blends the music to give great style and sound.."
1,Save Karyn,"The story (which I'd already heard about on the news when it happened) was pretty good, something many people can identify with, although her method of getting out of it is unrealistic and just makes me angry that she got out of it so fast. The writing style was elementary, and the editor sucked, as there were numerous glaring misspellings and other errors throughout."
5,Funny Book,"I think this book was hilarious and I can definitly relate. A lesson was learned Karyn was really creative and put a lot of time and effort into this book and her story. If people want to be generous and send her money then sobeit and if you do not, don't. It is ridiculous to criticize someone for accepting charity or just a little help in this case. Kudos Karen!"
1,"First, she begs for money and now a book?","My God. What has this country come to? This snit doesn't know anything about getting out of debt because she's never actually done it. Begging people for money isn't working to eradicate your debt. I have way more debt in student loans than she ever had, but I will never ask anybody to pay it for me. I took a second job instead. I've never wasted money like she does. I've never owned designer anything or spent $300 on a hairdo. My clothes and shoes are K-mart clearance rack. And I'm a better person for it. I have ethics and morals, instead of being a mooching, materialistic, shallow, selfish person like Karyn. What a pathetic loser she is!"
2,"ALMOST AS BORING AS THE MOVIE ""GIGLI""!!! Save your money.","No wonder why the stores aren't displaying this book! I had to search high and low for a copy. It was tucked away in the self-help section of the store. Where it should have STAYED! Being a fan of SaveKaryn.com I was excited to read her book! I found her writing to be less than superior and her story was, oh what's the word... BORING?""Save money by coloring your hair yourself."" THANK YOU KARYN for that ""expert"" advice. I give it two stars. One Star for the idea of making the website. The second would go to Karyn's acting ability. She must have sold someone who was lacking intelligence to actually publish this book. How about a sequel ""Fifteen Minutes Of Fame For Dummies!"" That may actually sell!"
4,Cute and funny,This book was very funny it kept me entertained. Not a hard read and somewhat inspirational in a quirky way lol
5,Painfully Familiar But Worth The Laughs,"I've been down Karyn's road. And as I could see so many familiarites as I read her story (in one sitting might I add), it was comforting to know that I'm not alone through the embarassment and out-of-control journey of the debt-laden. (Although I might add that I never spent $750 on a coat, and would never even consider spending $400 to get my hair done.)Karyn is a lively writer who uses the same tongue-in-cheek humor found on her web site to creat a fun, flowing recreation of her rise and fall...and rise again. You'll be cheering for her, scolding her, laughing at her and wondering if she's real after all.This is a fun read for anyone who has ever lost control with their finances only to find themselves eating Ramen every day and going out with creeps for a free dinner."
1,A Despicable Person,"While shamelessly begging on the Internet,Karen would occasionaly have a nice meal at a restaurant.Her 'tip' for the rest of us, is to simply not leave a tip!It's OK, you're on a budget!So sad for the waitperson.. but Karyn is smarter at watching her money now!Blechhh.I need to read some Jehovah's Witness pamphlets now, to cleanse my palate.( I am not now, nor have I ever been, a waitperson )-regards,Ra"
4,Interesting Read,"I had no idea who Karyn Bosnak was before reading this book and I was very intruiged by her story. The book was fun to read, funny at times and entertaining. It's not one that I think I'll re-read however."
5,I just loved it,"I bought this book the weekend before my wedding with plans to read it on the plane to our honeymoon. Instead, I could hardly put it down and before I knew it, I had finished the book before I walked down the aisle, much less boarded the plane. It's an easy read; Karyn's humor is priceless. I have been a loyal fan of her site for months and this book is a logical and wonderful extension. You should purchase it today!!"
1,"Irresponsibility, thy name is Karyn","The book purports to be an object lesson, but Bosnak should feel chastened and ashamed. Her irresponsibility and selfish behaviors should have landed her in the dumper, but instead she's lauded; not only that, but why would anyone have given this woman (who thinks spending more than $300 on her hair [!!] is acceptable) money, when she has no clue about what to do with it is beyond me. Another sickening example demonstrating the dangerous societal drift toward no consequences for bad behavior. Let this woman loose (without a coin to her name) in the slums of Cairo or Rio, and see how she views money thereafter."
1,Stop rewarding this idiocy,"This is what is wrong with the world today. People. Please. The whole idea was ludacris to start with, and now there is a book about it? Maybe I'll start publishing my grocery lists, They would be equally important to society."
5,Worthwhile for anyone who's ever been in huge debt!,"I could totally relate to Karyn's situation in her book, and it even inspired me to finally get my own credit card debt paid off. Though i didn't set up a website, at least it got me motivated to get to work! So far, i've gone from $5,000 to less than $1,800 in credit card debt. Not bad!Karyn writes very well and keeps things lighthearted. I felt like i was reading a book written by either myself or my own best friends. She realized the true ""pickle"" she had gotten herself into, and found an ingenious way to solve the problem. i couldn't agree more that most people were probably only offended by the site because they hadn't thought of it first!Worthwhile reading for anyone who's been in over their head, and definitely a must read for anyone who is in over their head right now!"
1,*WHY* are you enabling a panhandler?,"Karen is the worst kind of panhandler - she had the ability to at a minimum live at her means, or if she was truly inspired (which she is not), live below her means and do some saving, but instead she chose to be a materialistic snot and charge up $$k of crap. The website is a joke and so is she, but what is even more frightening is that people are actually inspired by her. She is vapid, specious, and fatuous. The book should have been called ""How I got a bunch of stuff I didn't earn then whined to strangers to essentially buy it for me!"""
5,Robbing Peter to Pay Paul,"This was a cute and funny book. I laughed as I read her justifications for the things she charged. When the light bulb finally turned on for her, she was having to charge on one card and take things back to pay on another card. I applaud her for creative method of paying off her debt."
5,A Must Read!!!,"I must admit, I initially bought the book because I thought it was a ""how to"" guide on getting out of debt. Once I realized it wasn't, I was pleasantly surprised by my mistake. I honestly could not put the book down! The book was hysterical! It was refreshing to know there are other people out there with similar situations to my own.I applaud Karyn for her guts and gusto! What she did is not something that can be repeated even though others have attempted. BRILLIANT!"
2,"Flat Writing, But Honest and Funny","Although I did not donate any money, I have followed her site and enjoyed it. She gets high marks for being honest in her effort, but if you've read the basics on her site there is no reason to buy the book. Besides, all the anywhos and yeps started to really grate on my nerves. The first half of the book wastes time on making the reader see how completely fabulous she is. The books wraps up with her still showing no real sign of humility. She does give some vivid stories that are good for a couple of laughs, but I'd still recommend putting the money you'd spend on this book towards your own credit card debt.Unless she can pull some more talents out of her hat, her 15 minutes are almost up."
4,Worth sticking with,"I started with the same reaction many reviewers have reported when they started reading: the writing style is repetitve and shallow, Karyn is selfish and self-absorbed, why bother to continue with this book? But as she slowly comes to more self-awareness and maturity, the sentence structure seems to reflect this by becoming more complex, more subtle and ironic. I ended up being glad I finished it. Nice touch.Mind you, I wouldn't have given her a penny (and I borrowed this book from a friend). Someone said this would be a great and hilarious book if it were fiction. Probably true, because the thought that this is a ""real"" inspiration for people makes me feel kind of itchy."
1,Terrible,"I thought I would enjoy this, I followed the story on the web, but the writing is terrible. I don't know who the ghos writer was, but the writing style was clearly different from her web postings.This book reads like a bad high school ""what I did on vacation"" essay. If you are interested in the story I suggest looking up an article online."
5,A truly good book!,"This was an excellent read about Karyn, a total shopaholic. Even though the situation is a serious one this book relates it with humor and compassion. I too am a total shopaholic and I could definitly relate to her story as I am sure many people can....I couldn't put the book down! It's also nice to know people out their are willing to help out someone in need! Karyn - great job in writing this book...I absolutely loved it!"
3,Sad that this is true,"I have to give her kudos for owning up to what she's done in her past and having the 'brain power' to write about it and make money on it. She's actually written this quite well. My problem lies with her being so irresponsible and having other people (maybe well meaning), footing her bills. She should have learned the hard way. Some of the stuff in here is simply so stupid. She at a lot of times was a pure idiot. I just congratulate her in finding yet another way to make money off us innocents who are far more responsilbe than her."
1,"I did not make this up - this is ""real"" savekaryn style","<i> ""May 2004I'm in London right now and holy smokes this city is great! I'll update soon! Go Chelsea Football Club!"" </i>so our all-time favorite (favourite by G.B. spelling) ""author"" got to visit London at last. Not a moment too soon. The above quote is from her Web-site, http://www.savekaryn.comher very own immortal words.This is all she managed to come up related to her book signing, London, 2004 May (all-expenses-paid, of course) trip.You have to admire her. Anything that helps to fatten her bank account is good. For her."
5,15 foot outlet strip,"you buy a outlet strip at the store, you get it home, plug it in. then #%$@&*$ you find out it is toooooooooooo short. the 15 footer will get you around most rooms. if you need more they make a 25 footer. this is a good product for a surge protector. all it takes is one time. so if you buy a good one and it does the job--what's left to say. this is a good one at a good price"
5,Long cord VERY useful,"This is exactly what i needed. My other power strips had much shorter cords, but this one is perfect for my computer. Very happy."
3,Outlet strip,What do you say about an outlet strip? It worked well. Nice long cord was convenient. I recommend this power strip if you need one.
2,To much,I needed a longer cord but this cord it WAY to long and the whole thing is so heavy. It's a lot bigger than it looks and not at all what I needed.
5,Inspired,"This is probably the best prose I have ever read! The way heaven, hell, and purgatory were depicted were amazing! This is truly an inspired work!"
4,Good basic text,"good translation - not excellent, but good, and the footnotes are helpful. The translator also makes an attempt at explaining the contrapasso for each Canto of Inferno, which can be helpful to the independant reader."
1,consistent: always fails!,"Several years ago I bought a ten-pack of Memorex CD-RWs from Amazon. the first 7 CDs either failed to record accurately or would not record at all.Amazon graciously agreed to exchange these CDs for another brand, even though the packaging had been opened.Two years later, I've just purchased another package of Memorex CD-RWs from another store (couldn't remember which brand was the bad apple, and in a hurry so I didn't go home to check my records first, shame on me.) these Memorex CD-RWs are all failing too.conclusion: In my experience this brand of CD-RWs has achieved 100% consistency: it fails. period. don't buy these!"
2,Umm....Well,I think these are the best thing ever i just wish you could write to them faster... 4x come on i can write to a CD-R at 32x!
5,Awesome action game,"This one awesome game. In my opinion, the best Robotech game there is. Being a huge Robotech fan, I expected a lot from this game and it delievered. It is so cool to be able to fight the Invid using the cyclone armor. Fans of Robotech will instantly recognize the story and several locations and characters. But even if you've never heard of Robotech, this is still a (...). Its a blast to charge into an area on your cyclone, firing rockets, switching to battle armor mode and then using your gallant rifle to finish off the stragglers. I have yet to try the online play via Xbox live, but if its anything like the single player, it is excellent. If you're a robotech fan, an action adventure/shooter game fan, or someone who likes try something different, this game is definately worth your time."
2,Need CLEARER Description of Product,"NOWHERE in the description of this game does it say it is only compatible with XBOX original console. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE AN XBOX 360 console!!! We wasted our time and money not only purchasing it, but then also returning it (at our expense), and then only getting a partial refund since it was ""Used."" We never even got to play the game."
4,Robotech INvasion,This game is awsome nice sequal to Battle cry. The battle with the Invid is similar to battle with the Zentradi.If your a fan of Robotech you will like this game just to add to your game collection.
2,Washingtons Writings,"After fully investigating the writings of Washington, I have concluded that Washington's writings fill about 40 volumes. He in fact speaks of and confirms that the Illuminati is historical and is in the US on at least two accounts. This volume is flimsy and should not be bought unless you are up for teaching a 1st Grade Class."
3,horrible doll,"Horrible, don't you dare buy it!!!!!!!!!!If i could go back in time, i wouldn't buy it"
5,""" Uncut Funk""","This is one of two live C.D.'s that I have by Bootsy and by far I feel this is the best.It has a kind of unpolished and raw edge to it.I feels like Bootsy's Rubberband was on a mission that night to lay down some serious grooves.From start to finish they were on ""FIRE""! This is what funkin' was about. Take it from a rubberfan of almost thirty years this C.D.aint no joke."
2,"Trouble, Trouble","Immediately after purchasing the player I had to return it because it hesitated badly on almost all DVDs. The player was gone for two weeks, but worked fine when it was returned. Player worked for the next 12 months of (infrequent) use, then just quit working. It is not worth paying for repairs, so it is being junked and I am buying another brand to replace it."
1,Bad News - again,"In September 2002, we purchased the Panasonic RV32S and were quite happy with it. Excellent value, picture quality, ease of setup... and all the other things people have raved about. UNTIL we got the dreaded HO2 error and couldnt play DVDs. It was still within the 1 yr parts warranty of course though over the 90 day labor warranty. So the shop we took it to wanted a deposit just to look at it and estimated it would cost more than half the price of a new player. ""Oh well - we got a lemon"", we thought and happily went and bought another one. Now, 92 days after purchasing that new player, it wont read ANYTHING! zip, zero, zilch... put in a disc of ANY format and it says ""No Play"". It cant read ANYTHING... just sits and spins the disc around! Course what does Panasonic say? ""Take it in for repair"" - of course, to that same ... repair shop.Off to buy a Sony - ""Fool me once, shame on you, Fool me twice, shame on me"". Should have bought a Sony last time."
1,In case you need another one: H07 error,"I can't believe that Panasonic would allow the sale of this unit to continue. Read the reviews: the H07 error is a chronic, fatal failure. The repair cost greatly exceeds the cost of the unit so I'm throwing this one-year old unit into the garbage. Is this Japan's revenge for WWII?"
2,H02 Error -- What does it mean?,"I bought an earlier model Panasonic DVD-RV21. I rarely used it and it seemed to function fine except once in a great while I had to turn it off to get it ""unconfused"" and, it seemed a bit slow to read the DVD's. Now after it is off-warranty, I'm getting the ""H02"" message too. The player can't read the DVD's because it won't spin. It's not the motor and the laser lens is clean. I think Panasonic has a serious ""logic"" bug/problem with their design. I love Panasonic quality and features, but now I am soured on Panasonic DVD players. This thing looks like new and I only played maybe 15-20 DVD's on it. TOO BAD! I refuse to pay them to fix it and get an eventual encore breakdown. I'll try Sony next!"
5,Excellent DVD player for the money,"Just picked this DVD player up along with an Acoustic Research 6 foot S-Video Video + Audio (rca type) cable. This review is on the Panasonic RV32K (black). The black and silver versions are identical except for the color. Anywho, on to the review. This is my first real DVD player (had an X-Box before, but A. It didn't play VCDs, and B. it wouldnt play some regular DVDs... so I got this one). I must say, I am quite happy with it. I only had one single hiccup with this DVD player when playing Monsters Inc, and it was very slight. This DVD player has verrrry good picture quality, a decent remote (so-so). I don't know much about DVD players, but in a room full of DVD enthusiasts, as a starting DVD player, this was highly reccommended. I love it alot."
2,I can't hear you.,"I bought this product to replace the Toshiba, which died after a year of infrequent use. The picture quality appears inferior to the similarly priced Toshiba from the last year. The biggest problem I had with this product was that the sound level for dialogue was so faint that it was largely buried by the other sounds. This is even with the dialogue enhancer, which by the way doesn't work with some of the disks. If I turn up the volume, though, the other sound effects get way too loud. By the end of a movie, I was so tired just trying to follow the dialogue. During that movie, there was a brief moment of picture freeze, probably not a big deal, though."
1,H07 error kills me (and my DVD),"Interesting. Panasonic has NOTHING on their site that helps me find out what the heck H07 means. So I Google, and find out there are lots of H07's out there! My DVD's about a year old. Tonight...""H07"" on the display...and we've gotta put the unit curbside!!??"
1,H07 ass,"I just got this error message for the first time after about 2.5 years of occasional use. It now does not seem to play any DVDs anymore. I suspect it's either a joke by Panasonic, or some kind of DVD virus... although I can't recall that I played any illegal or downloaded items on my DVD player... my display now always says ""H07 ass"" (ok maybe H07 bASS), but I think it's a message to all panasonic consumers.... read into it what you like... has Panasonic said anything about this message???"
1,Add us to the list of H07 errors,Bought this DVD player about 15 months ago. Last night got the H07 error and will be looking for a new DVD player - and not a Panasonic. For some reason Consumer Reports isn't saying much about this problem but don't be fooled.
1,Another HO7 error,"Had this unit just over a year and the HO7 error has come up. Having looked at other postings and reviews, panasonic seems like a good brand to avoid."
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"Well, what can I say about this piece of **** that hasn't already been said? Mine is 13 months old, just out warranty. It's now dead. (H20) It always did hesitate when reading a DVD for some reason. Thank-you SO much Panasonic. I will NEVER purchase another piece of garbage from your once mighty company ever again."
1,H07 Error!!,"Like everyone else, I'm getting an H07 error which means that the drive isn't spinning anymore! I've had it less than a year and of course didn't get the warrantee like a SMART CONSUMER WOULD!"
1,H07 Error,"My 2 year old Panasonic RV32 DVD player just died recently, and displayed an ""H07"" error code. I checked the user manual, and the Panasonic sites, but got no help...Then I Googled ""Panasonic+DVD+H07"" and came across thousands of posts about this problem. It looks like it is a fairly common problem with the Motor spindle and costs heaps to repair. Panasonic do not acknowledge that this is a general problem, and have not issued a product recall.There are a few work arounds posted on the net, like oiling the motor or cleaning the lens, but neither worked for me.I contacted Panasonic, and was told that I was out of warranty, so needed to get it repaired myself. I won't be wasting any money on that route, but need to know if this problem is as common as it appears to be. If so, maybe we have grounds for a case against the manufacturer.I have set up an MSN group called ""H07 Hunters"" to try and see how many genuine victims there are."
4,A good unit with a few flaws,"I bought this unit for several reasons. Design, functions, capabilities, and cost. I spent alot of time checking several units and settled on this unit. My complaints after owning it for roughly 2 weeks come down to two main things: the unit makes alot of noise which is not a problem when the sound system is turned up. The second complaint refers to the ejection unit which is incredibly slow to open. You get a fairly good unit for the cost but don't expect perfection."
2,H07 has struck again,I've had mine for at least 3 years and now it's finally dead. I've received the H07 error in the past and the player still worked after I re-inserted the disk but not this time. It was good while it lasted but now I must buy a new dvd player. And it won't be a panasonic.
1,H07 error,"After only two years of moderate use received the H07 error. (The spindle motor that spins the DVD does not work.) Searched online for fixes and contacted Panasonic. Online fixes didn't work and Panasonic support was awful! Essentially it is boat anchor. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. And, I would think twice about any/all Panasonic products."
2,Stopped working after 1 year! HO7 Error,"I bought my Panasonic DVD-RV32 dvd player in late 2003. Here it is January 2004 & I tried to play a Star Trek movie today & it would not play the movie. It recognized the disc... read the disc... went into the stop mode, displayed ""STOP"" on the unit's display & then displayed ""HO7"", which I later found out is an error message. The funny thing is that it worked fine yesterday.As so many other people have reported about this unit, I am joining the league of disappointed owners of this product... the PANASONIC RV-32. It worked ok while it lasted, but it didn't last! I hope that this dvd player is not evidence of something pandemic in the entire line of Panasonic products. I've always had good luck with Panasonic televisions... even as I write this!RobertSeverna Park, Maryland"
1,Engineered Obsolescence,"This machine is excellent during the warranty period; however, the HO7 timebomb went off right on schedule -- just after the warranty expired.My friend's died a week ago. We got them at the same time."
1,Add me to the list....,"Of those who have received the infamous H07 error. One minute it was working fine, next minute nada. I have had problems with this unit opening up slowly for a while now, it has finally kicked the bucket. I've had it for slightly more than 1 year. I definitely will not be purchasing another Panasonic product. I guess I'm off to buy a new one in the morning."
1,H07 - do not buy this garbage,I had this unit for fifteen months and it stopped working giving the H07 error message. Googling revealed that this seems to happen to them all after a few months of ownership as the result of a weak spindle motor design. This product is clearly not fit for the purpose for which it was sold and Panasonic should either recall these or provide a no quibble refund / replacement (with a different working model). That Panasonic appear to be washing their hands of this problem for those whose machine dies out of warranty is scandalous.
3,"Great on DVDs, drops out on CDs","Don't know if others have this problem, but when we play a music CD, we get audio-drop outs- sometimes many on one CD. This happens on many CDs, even brand new ones, which all play fine on our computers and other players. Occasional burps with DVDs but that's rare. Still trying to determine if there's a way to adjust the sensitivity, though we can't find it. I recommend it with reservations.UPDATE IN APRIL 2005: NEVER could fix the audio cd issue. Plays DVD movies wonderfully well... SUCKS on music CDs."
2,HO7 error,Have had this DVD player for about three years. It stopped playing in the middle of a movie last night. It wouldn't play so I thought maybe the disc was dirty. H07 kept appearing in the display. I have since found out that HO7 isn't a good thing. It's really disappointing to buy something that last only three years. I will not buy another Panasonic even if they make the best one on the market.
3,Everyday Santoku!!,This is a lovely light weight knife that is good for everyday cutting. It has a comfortable grip for smaller hands. I enjoy working with it.
3,Price Increases,I have purchased a number of these knives. They started out in the $7.00 range and keep going up. They are a handy size and i feel a safer knife for my grandmother age hands. They can be sharpened and should be kept sharp. But they have out priced themselves.
2,Rusted.,"This was a pretty good knife -- cheap and sharp, decent handle and feel.But i had it for less than 4 months and it rusted in several places on the blade. Granted, I left this knife in the sink a couple of times for a day, but I kinda feel that a blade should be able to handle that."
5,Very versitle knife,I already had this knife myself and loved it. My daughter wanted one too. It was particularly easy for her to use with her carpel tunnel problems. I was delighted when I found it. the whole transaction wasy very smooth and delivery was super quick. thanks.
1,Rusted within a month,"Not worth the money. I was so excited about this knife, it cut supremely and had a great weight. I handwashed it and left it to dry laying down on a rack. The next day it had rust on both sides of the blade. I sadly discarded it."
2,What's clear is that these labels are not,"From the description, these labels seemed perfect for our needs. Unfortunately, when we actually printed the labels and placed them on the envelopes the one thing that was clear was that the labels were anything but. They do not disappear on contact; in fact, they stand out. They could almost have a sign on them saying, ""Look! Labels!"" Just in case I am not being clear, let me put it this way: these labels are about as clear as the Invisible Man after having a bag of flour fall on his head. On the transparency scale, they beat out a brick wall but only with effort.If we weren't under a deadline, we'd return them and get a different brand."
3,Plastic Salt Block Holder,Seems sturdy and made of durable plastic. But a regular 4# salt block barely fits into it. It's such a tight fit that you have to get the tabs to bed outwards a little bit (thus weakening the plastic) and the salt block doesn't set against the back of the holder. A little bit bigger and this thing would be perfect.
3,Not a bad checklist...,"Parents who wish for confident girls will find the ""usual"" list here, all centering around developing respect and confidence in girls. There are some glaring omissions, however. (Nothing on boundary setting, questions that girls may have about development.) Some of the recommendations may be wrong in certain settings (e.g., ""Don't impose your views"" makes no sense if the child is not safe). This is child-centered, laissez-faire parenting, suitable for middle-class, well-educated, physically safe families.Some of the 100 tips parallel exactly the 100 items for boys in the author's book for boys (e.g., Support the school).This book is better than Will Glennon's ""200 Ways to Raise a Girl's self-esteem."""
4,A fun ghostly mystery story!,"Well, I for one enjoyed this book. It not only was my introduction to Walter Scott but to some of the history of Scotland. I found the Scottish brogue an absolute thrill to read and it really helped to take me to Edinborough. I was pleased to meet not only the gentleman sleuth (Walter Scott) but also the brave, strong and witty Midge Margaret. I enjoyed each new twist pulled into the plot and found that Ms. Scarborough somehow wonderfully managed to write of such horrid and frightening happenings in a suspenseful yet tasteful way instead of concentrating on blood and gore. This book left me wanting to learn more about Walter Scott, Scotland AND the many mysteries touched on within this book. Any book that spurs me on to read deeper into its subjects is a good book indeed!"
5,My Favorite EA Scarborough book so far,"Atmospheric, moody, intriguing. Brings together literary (Sir Walter Scott) nobility, medical science, and common riff-raff (gypsies) for a rollicking tale. Reads like a classic, with exactly the right amount of words to describe the events. Brings Scotland to life in a time when that life had a particular odor. Well done Ms. Scarborough!"
3,"Pleasant, but somewhat predictable","I've enjoyed Scarborough's previous fantasy works. They're always quite readable and did a fine job portraying ordinary people put into extraordinary circumstances. However, I found this novella particularly predictable. It's not just that the identity of the villain is handed to the reader in the first chapters of the book (no, it doesn't pretend to be a mystery novel), but also all the plot twists and complications are very straightforward and usually loudly heralded before Scarborough brings the reader to their advent. On the positive side, the depictions of Edinburgh are vivid and plentiful, and will strike a chord with anyone who has trod the Royal Mile or gazed on the Salisbury Crags. And, as ever, Scarborough provides likable, lively characters with wit."
2,Old school leadership,"The premise of this book is that leadership ""is the ability to get the right things accomplished at the right time with the assistance of other people."" Consequently, it teaches that the primary skills of a leader are technical and analytical skills - relationship skills come secondary.If you agree with me that leadership in fact is much more about the ability to help other people getting the right things accomplished at the right time, you might still get something out of this book, but likely not as much as you would have hoped."
2,He's not talking about leadership.,"Ponder seems confused. In a simplistic sense, management is about left-brain processes (linear logic, written plans, checklists, etc.)while leadership is about right-brain processes (emotion, vision, etc.)Ponder's book is primarily about management. He gives lots of useful left-brain processes.But there is little or nothing about the empowering effect of leadership, whereby a leader proposes a vision and the intended followers rise up and follow, saying things like, ""That's what I've always felt...""Leadership is a skill that can be taught. Ponder doesn't seem to know what it takes.Having trained and coached leaders, entrepreneurs, and managers around the world, I certainly recognize the need for a good work on this subject. However, the skills actually involved are non-traditional, to say the least."
1,"Just a survey, lacks depth","I expected more from this book. It reads as a survey of other management literature rather than as a field guide for developing management skills. The major topics are all there, but there is no depth in either information or writing style. Stick to books with a tighter focus, such as ""Teamwork"" by Larson and ""Rapid Development"" by McConnell."
5,Lots of Bang for the Buck,"We have enjoyed this excellent book and my company is using it for our new leadership development program for several reasons.It addresses the subjects our managers need to hear: communication, conflict resolution, problem solving, strategy, etc.. We need practical advice; this book delivers well.It also is easy to understand and implement. The step-by-step approach to each of the skills is one that is made to last and works well with our diverse supervisors, who are at many levels of expertise. They like it, so they will use it.Finally, the price is superb and doesn't involve a huge investment on our part when compared to the benefits we receive. Highly recommend this superb guide to management and leadership."
1,This book was of no value to me or any of my managers.,"I feel the authors have overlooked the most essential skill in their view of leadership: the practice of integrity!All leadership starts with integrity and a strong ethical foundation. A better place to invest if you really want a book that can help you is to purchase Stephen Carter's influential book, Integrity; Leigh Steinberg's Winning With Integrity; or even Integrity Selling: How to Succeed in Selling in the Competitive Years Ahead by Ron Willingham (all available from Amazon.com!). Both readers and the authors of this book would benefit from first examining these titles."
2,Scent is too strong,The scent of this handsoap is far too strong and it doesn't smeall a thing like the lemon verbena plants I love to grow. It was disappointing.
1,Dries out your hands,"Mrs. Meyers' hand soap kills your hands. Mine are cracked and dry unlike ever before. I've been using the Basil and it's a nightmare - it's not just a bit of dryness, my hands are sore. I've never had a problem like this with any soap or with excessively dry hands until I met Mrs. Meyers. It's the Chinese drywall of hand soaps."
1,not so lemony,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this soap. What a disappointment it was. It was rather harsh on my skin and the fragrance was not lemony at all. In fact it was rather unpleasant. Unfortunately these six bottles are going in the garbage can. I'm still in search for the perfect liquid hand soap."
3,basil conentrate,"well, if you really like the smell of strong basil this is for you.for me, this is tooo strong."
4,Pretty good,Will probably order again. Smells good...but so do many other soaps. I'm not sure what sets this products apart from the others. I just like that I can but it in bulk.
5,Everyone makes a comment about the soap,"Just moved into a new house and decided to only use Mrs. Meyers in the kitchen and bathrooms. Everyone comments how great the fragrance is. And when I use the countertop cleaner, then people want to know which air freshener I use - none. The countertop cleaner works as both! Geranium is my favorite. Not too flowery. Even my guys use it."
5,GREAT FOR FOAM SOAP REFILL,"I bought the Lavender and really like it. I use the soap to make foam soap. Use 3 TBLS of the soap and add 2/3 cup warm water to a pump soap bottle. Let the bottle sit for 10 minutes, DO NOT SHAKE!! There you have it, your own homemade foam soap. This way your Mrs. Meyer's will go much further. Love the fact that this soap leaves your hands feeling soft."
5,An Olfactory Godsend,"I love the refreshing, gentle aroma of lavender. There are few aromas as pleasing as lavender. This particular soap is my favorite of the Mrs. Meyer's soap products. Your hands have a smooth, clean feel with no soapy residue after you rinse them off. The bottle has a pump that works quite well and as another reviewer on the US boards noted, adding a little water when your supply runs low helps you use every bit of this soap without it going to waste."
4,Nice soap,"I bought this soap because it does not contain triclosan, an antibacterial agent found in many soaps. This soap is very nice ."
5,"Nice pleasant smell, leaves hands feeling clean not dry.","I'll start by saying I am a medical professional and wash my hands all day long. So I really notice the soaps that dry out my skin. I find this soap to be very mild/gentle on the skin, but still feels very clean. I also like the mild lavender smell, not overpoweringly perfumed as some soaps are. I now use this as my sole handsoap at home.To top it off if you purchase it via subscribe and save option you really can't beat the price either.Good Soap, Good buy."
5,A favorite!,I used to get the lavender scent soap. But ended up ordering the lemon verbena this time by mistake. What a great mistake! I love this scent and this soap has since taken over as the house favorite. The scent is nice and clean. Not too flowery.
3,Perfume,"I really liked the smell of this at first. It didn't take long, however, to be overwhelmed by the scent. Calling it Basil is a stretch. It just smells sweetly perfumed to me - to the point that you can smell it when someone has washed their hands with it and they walk by you. I won't buy it again."
5,Fantastic hand soap,We love this hand soap...it cleans without drying your skin and it smells great! We will definitely buy This product again.
3,Perfect soap,Perfect soap for everyday washing and aroma therapy. Not a great value but not a ripoff. Had one case returned. Sometimes it does not have a great packaging.
3,I love Mrs Meyers products - but disappointed with this fragrance,"After using Mrs Meyers' basil dish soap at a friend's house and liking that scent, I ordered these liquid soaps. I find the scent to be very strong and overpowering. However my biggest issue is that this particular scent smells very synthetic to me, unlike this company's other soaps ( I like the Lemon Verbena a lot). I now have 6 bottles of this stuff so I'm hoping I'll grow ""used"" to it, but wanted to warn others.... if you dislike strong scents, you might want to try a different scent from this company."
2,Very Hard on the Hands,"I bought the lemon verbena fragrance in this hand soap. Although it cleans well, I found the product to be very irritating, causing itching, dryness and redness of my hands. If you're searching for a natural hand soap, I recommend Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap. It's SLS free, great for your skin and the environment, and a little goes a long way."
5,love this!,This is my favorite hand soap and I love the crisp clean scent. I can't think of anything else to say!
3,"Alright at first, then start to smell kind of bad the more I use it","I don't know what it is, but I feel like a month after using this product, my hands smell bad after using this to wash. I can't pinpoint what's bad about it. My guess is too much chemicals in this product...doesn't smell natural."
4,I love the lavender smell of this product!!,"In addition to the wonderful smell of this product, I enjoy the sudsy, lather of the product. A little of it goes a long way, so the product lasts a long time. Product rinses off easily. I found the price to be a great buy through Amazon. My only complaint is that this soap seems to be a tad drying to the skin."
4,Soap Gift,I got this soap for my sister-in-law because she had used it before and wanted more for christmas. She loves the smell and it cleans your hands very well.
3,"Good scents, cleans well, but dries out your hands","I wash my hands a million times a day. I have a toddler (which means diaper changes), i garden, and i prepare food, all of which require hand washing either before or after.At first i was a big fan of this soap. The scents are pleasant and not too strong, and it made quick work of cleaning my hands.Over time, though, my hands started getting really dry. Really really dry. After about three weeks of having Mrs. Meyers soap at my kitchen and bathroom sink, my the skin on my knuckles started to crack and bleed.So the Mrs. Meyers soap is in the guest bathroom now, since using it a few times shouldn't hurt anyone's skin, and i'm back to usingKiss My Face Organic Self-Foaming Liquid Soap, even if the new pump design is hard to use.If you never have any trouble with dry skin, or have the time and energy to put lotion on your hands every time you wash them, this soap should work well for you. If not, stay far, far away."
2,The scent is overpowering,"This soap's fragrance is very strong. I have it in my kitchen and, if I use it before I eat, it can overpower my meals. My wife and kids musn't like it either as it sits beside the Soft Soap and goes unused. I've tried and enjoyed some of the other cleaners in this line, but the hand soap is too fragrant."
1,Quality and Design Problems,"I purchase three of this product for my husbands cell phone. He is a contractor and needs a secure clip while working. The clip is heavy, big and bulky and because of this problem, the clip pulls away from the leather of the case and breaks off. My husband has already gone thru two of the three cases I purchased in less than a month. I do not recommend this product."
3,A chance to see a classic lineup,"I bought this video expecting a live concert of my favorite version of Steps Ahead (though I'm partial to the original lineup as well), and it IS live, but it's just the group playing in the atrium of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek; no audience. Video and audio quality are quite respectable given the age of this film. The playing doesn't have the fire of say, ""Smokin' in the Pit"", but I would attribute that to the rather sterile recording conditions...the lack of an audience keeps this from being an absolutely amazing concert DVD. What we have instead is some very good performances by some brilliant musicians (Elias was 18!!!) playing very hip modern jazz. Notwithstanding the somewhat cold and impersonal quality this DVD exhibits, it is still great to see this band and these players play, and at this price, hard to beat for a Steps fan."
1,So abominable that I had to create a log in and yell about it.,Worst. Book. Ever. I'm not even kidding. There's nothing redeemable here. You might as well keep looking.
2,Don't Expect the Chills of the Original,"It is almost a sin to use the same title (Untold Story) when referring to this disappointing sequel. The original was bone-chilling...priceless...broke new ground in gore and horror. This one is almost a comedy. The characters are unconvincing...some of the cast should quit their acting career tomorrow (if they haven't already)...and the soundtrack is childish and completely out of synch with the screenplay. The goriest scene is when the wife is butchered in the bathtub by what appears to be an oversized electric meat carver. What makes it even more silly, is that it is an electric (cord and all) carver, being used to slice and dice underwater (????). The best part of this film is that its title hits home on two very important regards...it should go untold and ""unseen""."
4,good book,"even though the author is a goofy gutless liberal i do like the Hap and leonard series of books. The rest of his books are crap, total waste of time and money."
2,OFFENSIVE TO THE MAX!!!,"THIS WAS MY 3rd """"HAP & LEONARD"""".IT MANAGED TO OFFEND ?? SIX ?? DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE FIRST 5 PAGES.OKAY THE FIRST """"H&L;"""" WAS INTERESTING----THE SECOND WAS OKAY----NOW---OLD HAT!! I CAN SEE THAT THEY WILL ALL BE SORTA THE SAME---KINDA LIKE """"SPENSER"""" ONLY NOT NNNEEEAAARRRLLLYY AS GOOD."
2,Continuing Disappointment,I discovered the author through Captains Outrageous and thought where has this author been all my life. It turns out he has been busy writing mediocre books. This is a drawn out tale about the pair being in the middle of a racist town investigating a racist murder for most of the book. They finally get to the bottom of things as a flood comes along and washes away all the bad guys and the evidence of our pairs extrajudicial efforts. For about 20-30 pages toward the end after the heros get beaten up the old byplay resurfaces but it doesn't last. It's just a reminder of what the author could do when he was on his game. I see comedy is an option for a tag for this review. They must be kidding.
3,Good enough to make me want more,"Two-Bear Mambo was my first Lansdale novel. The characters are wonderful and the dialogue is reminiscent of Robert S. Parker's Spenser and Hawk. I live in Texas and am very familiar with East Texas - the location of Hap and Leonard's escapades. I can smell the piney woods of East Texas when I read the book. The plot was not as complex as I have come to love in James Lee Burke novels. There was enough in this novel, however, to make me want to read more. I just ordered Vanilla Ride."
5,Fun fun movie!,"Love it! Fun movie! My son loved it when he was three years old and still does at 12. The musical numbers are fantastic and the story is sweet. I was very skeptical when I saw the title. I mean, really, a story about a bunch of cartoon appliances who travel the country looking for the little boy who used to use them. Rented it as a joke but fell in love. Definitely one of my top ten 'family movies'."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"One of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Many of the scenes did nothing to enhance the plot, which I couldn't quite swallow anyway. A kid played with a toaster and a vacuum cleaner? Isn't that a little dangerous and wierd?The songs seemed forced, and, again, didn 't really help the story along. The parts shop scene scared my 4 year-old. I've seen PG movies that were less scary. I could go on and on, but I'll spare you any more bizarre, boring details from the movie and just encourage you NOT to waste time or money on this poor excuse for a Disney movie."
1,Inappropriate images for young children,"Use your pause button to get a close look at the ""photo"" pulled out of the file cabinet by the Television character as he discusses the carcinogenic effect of a particular appliance retailer. Totally inappropriate for young children."
1,Porn in a child's film,"My mom and I watched this movie today. When the tv is trying to get the master's attention, the man shows a nude woman with only stars over her breasts. My mom has thrown out this movie and contacted the company that made it. She is very upset and angry."
1,SICK AND DISTURBING,"... Frankly, I think that it is extremely sick and disturbing. I wish I had never seen it at all. Now, this may come as a shock that Disney would make a movie that is like this, but I'm not kidding. I would like to speak out for all the future kids who may see this, and ask the parents to watch it first and then decide. My mom just watched a little of it today, and was shocked. I honestly don't know what the creaters of this movie were thinking or were on. I would not reccomend this movie to any small child or even adult. Watch it first, then decide if this is a movie you feel comfortable having your children see. I know I wouldn't."
1,Jittery,The movie itself was as good as I remembered but however they recorded it to dvd left the screen jittery and jumpy like we were watching it on a projector. Bad quality.
4,I LOVE THIS CARTOON,"As a child of 80's, The Brave Little Toaster is one of the very few cartoon movies that I vividly remember. (I'm not talking about classic Snow White or Bambi - we all remember those) Premiering in 1987, the story revolves around 5 appliances that feel ditched by their master and go in search of him. I think the movie was very well-done, displayed immense emotion, and had a good story line. It makes you think - what if you appliances actually did have feelings? Anyways, this is a quality flick and isn't that crappy cartoon quality we get today in movies. Question though for everyone - is the toaster a boy or a girl?"
3,Rocks,"I am 15 years old and proud to say that The Brave Little Toaster rocks my socks. What an amazing piece of art, no question. Buy it. Right now."
5,Brave Little Toaster!,"Every child should see this movie it's a old movie but it sure is a instant classic to watch. If you have a child that's around three years of age show them this and I promise they will not stop watching it, Give them the gift of ""The Brave Little Toaster"" and they will give you the gift of a Brave Little Child."
1,DVD with VHS Tracking Type of Problems,Viewing the Brave Little Toaster DVD was like watching a very used VHS tape. There were tracking lines shaking through the entire movie. The quality does not look like anything Disney produced. It viewed like a pirated copy of a bad VHS tape.The Brave Little Toaster
4,Wonderful Kid's Movie,Ordering this item was a breeze. It arrived by post alot sooner than I thought which was great. The movie was excellent. Because it is such an old movie it is not of the best quality as movies are now but was a thoroughly good movie all the same. Really happy with the product. Can't beat a classic!
2,Surprised at the G rating,"This movie frightened my 3.5 year old, and we only made it to the scary clown in toaster's nightmare. NOT RECOMMENDED for SMALL CHILDREN."
2,Is this a joke?? Come on! The brave little TOASTER???,"It gets 2 stars (rather than 1) because it's so bad, it's funny. The music is the worst thing. One of the songs contains this lyric (actually, it's the main theme of the song and its title): ""It's like a moo-vieee. It's a B-movie show."" Imagine this in a low monotone repeated over and over. I think it's supposed to sound dire and scary. You know what's really scary? I know an adult who liked this movie. And she doesn't even have kids the right age. Combine the *TERRIBLE* music with the toaster and electric blanky (with sickeningly sweet voices) who try to find The Master who has moved away and left them in the old house...and what do you get? It's like a B-movie show."
5,Amazing.,"I remember watching The Brave Little Toaster when I was little, and wow! Does this bring back so many memories. I adore this movie, and everybody I know who has seen it adores it as well. From the animation and quality of the movie, you'd never guess it was made in the mid-80s. Plus, it got to my apartment really fast - about three/five days after I ordered it."
5,The Brave Little Toaster,More of a cult classic for adults. I watched this movie years ago when my children were younger and I was always intrigued. This was probably one of the first cartoons that had adult humor that the kids missed. It can be scary at times (an appliance is killed and the other appliances run for their lives.) I probably would not recommend it for little ones.
5,Great movie,"I loved it as a child, and still love it. I see nothing wrong with the messages throughout it, and would have no problems showing it to children. Take some of these reviews with a grain of salt and make your own mind up about the messages conveyed for your children."
5,classic kids movie!,"this movie brings back so many memories for me! i love this adorable disney film, and watched it over and over as a kid. now my nieces love it just as much as i did! great to find it on dvd, as our old vhs copy was starting to deteriorate.. great price for a great movie."
3,outdated...buy it for the nostalgia?,"The songs, and obviously the graphics are out of date. I bought this on a recommendation from a friend who is in her 60s. Being in my 30s, I couldn't get it into nor did my 2 year old son. Not a big fan of the music or the story either."
3,Wasn't as good as I remembered,"I used to watch this movie religiously when I was a kid, and for only 4.00 I thought why not."
3,a TV Classic !!,"Great movie, full of friendship values. I remember watching it while I was a kid, and I loved the story, very warm. Please get it for your kids."
3,Classic Kids Movie Brings Back Memories but poor video quality,"Movie arrived in good condition and was purchased as a gift. We enjoyed revisiting our youth with a classic film but for some reason, during the first 5-10 min, the movie was shaking back and forth. It was if we were watching the film on the original VHS copy. Eventually, the movie quality improved and the shaking ceased."
3,A fine product for young and old,"My sister received the product of her youth in record time, still too late for her bday, but that was all my fault. She was happy to see it in her possession and is happy to see it to this day as is her daughter... As I said, great for young and old."
2,VHS dubbed?,"I was very excited to find this movie on DVD, but very disappointed by the quality of the picture. It looks as if they recorded it from an old VHS copy. The picture has fuzz and dirt that flashes on the picture and it's a little jumpy. Was very disappointed for it being a DVD."
2,The Brave Little Toaster,"Wish I had read Other reviews before I hit purchase, it is really shaky at the beging like recorded from a tv of the vhs, not fixed up at all. Hopful they will realease it soon in better retouched quality. It is nice to be able to watch it when you want and when it gets past the shaky part it is ok.The Brave Little Toaster"
2,If you like motion sickness...,"I remember watching this movies as a kid. I always loved it so I wanted to give it as a gift to my daughter for Christmas. The picture quality is terrible. The picture shakes and moves back and forth, it's hard to watch, even giving me motion sickness. We paid $4.99 for this and I'm debaiting on weather or I will send this back. I guess you get what you pay for and this movie is probably something Disney won't ""re do"" like they would a classic, like dumbo or Cinderella. Maybe next time!"
4,Adorable,I loved this movie as a child and I was quite excited when I saw that is was available. For the price the dvd is good quality and it's still the movie I remember. I never knew there was a sequel.
5,So happy to get this.,My kids all grew up watching this. They loved it. Now my daughter has a son and they will be watching tgether. I reccomend this movie.
1,A terrible DVD of a wonderful movie,"Disney should be ashamed for producing such a lousy DVD of this great classic cartoon. I almost got sick in the beginning because the picture was constantly swaying back and forth. The ""camera jiggle"" effect is seen throughout the DVD, but is most noticible during the opening credits because most of the shots are still. The movement of the action in the rest of the film masks the flaw, but it is still there.Let's hope that some day, Disney will see fit to restore this film to its original quality."
1,"Great Movie, HORRIBLE DVD",It looks like someone handheld a VHS-C camcorder to the screening of a worn out film. I would honestly rather watch the VHS tape. Can you say motion sickness? I'm so disappointed...
5,I LOVE this Movie,"The Brave Little Toaster is my favorite disney movie bacause it is one of the few disney movies without talking animals, I throughly enjoyed the brave little toaster and i still watch it on vhs from time to time, i hope that it comes out on DVD soon. This Movie is one that the Entire Family will love."
5,Awesome,"Who can't sympathize with the brave little toaster? Add thuis one to your collection, even if you don't have kids."
3,Thought I liked it as a kid,"The movie quality and play was in good condition. The movie content was not how I remember it being little. The movie was really was long and full of problematic situations that got old really fast. I also didn't realize how many weird parts there were (sharp toothed clowns in nightmares, little blankey saying it was okay to die now) and I am not usually too upset on stuff like that. For a kids move- not my 1st choice."
2,A disappointing sequel,"""Cold Shoulder"", the first novel in this series, was successful largely because of its rich characterizations. In this sequel, the characters have already been developed and not much happens to them, outside the relatively pedestrian mystery plot. Lorraine Page has another brush with the bottle, but this turns out to be nothing more than a red herring designed to artifically add to the suspense. The book also suffers from a weak false ending. Readable and generally enjoyable, but hardly up to the standard of the original."
5,Great intro to the history of classical scholarship,"Informative and invaluable, Scribes and Scholars lends itself to the curiosity of the litterati as well as it does to the serious inquiry of beginning scholars. From the viable book trade of ancient Greece, through the centuries of forgotten scholarship and preservation, to the impetus of modern textual criticism, Scribes and Scholars is informing, engaging, and worth the cost."
1,Poorly Printed,"No doubt a classical textbook may be mentioned in every book concerning about the histoty of classical scholarship.But poorly printed,not as good as the second edition,even worse than a copy one."
4,Old Skool Kung Fu!!,"I though this flick was just o.k,,,,,I'm not sure about a 5 star,,,as is claimed by the previous reviewer!! The dvd transfer is not the greatest, the choreography is accepatble, however, the plot I though was very impressive,,as the previous reviewer quote ' AMBITIOUS"",,I duly agree!! Definately a good movie to check out,,,see Carter Wong performed brilliantly!!"
5,Get this book now!,This book is a page turner. Read it on a cross country flight. Could not put it down. The characters really reflect some of the colorful people I have met in the media business. Fantastic plot line--an engaging read.
4,Almost what I wanted,"Where is Johnny Puleo when you need him? I cannot find any CDs with Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang on them. As a substitute, I purchased this CD. It's fine. Some of the songs are very well done and nicely recorded. The trio just seemed to be missing something. Maybe they needed a fourth person? I wanted that wild, rapid harmonica sound. Jerry Murad's Harmonicats gave me that a few times, but didn't always deliver. Sometimes, the tempo just seemed a bit too slow.Still, as a novelty, and to round out your collection, you should get this album.Anyone found Johnny Puleo? On CD????????"
2,Very disappointing! Nothing Like the Original Recordings of the '50s & '60s.,"I grew up listening to the Harmonicats when my father played the Harmonicats' albums on his ""hi fi"". The sound of the lead harmonica was strong and pure. Jerry could really make that harmonica ""sing""! Years ago, I recorded some of the songs from my father's albums on casettte and compared them to this album. The songs on this album are not the same. They were rerecorded with too much and too loud background instrumentation. It severely takes away from the purity of the lead harmonica. Nothing like the original recordings of the '50s and '60s that my father and I loved. OVERALL A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"
1,Krap,"Unfortunately I had the receiver and camera set that goes with this so I ended up buy this second camera. They are all poorly made, and don't last. SVAT customer service is a joke."
2,What am I missing?,"Apparently, a lot. This book makes me want to go out and buy a different one on the same subject. I can't seem to find anything in it that is useful. Either they left a lot out, or I am just looking in the wrong book. I see things on Ebay all the time that one would think would be in here but they are not. I've only identified one pattern so far. There are no toothpick holders or salt cellars. I'm more confused now than before. The pictures are dull and boring. I think a Field Guide in general is a bad idea because the size of the photos is so small. Sticking to the large books would have been better."
3,"good product, but didn't expand to the sixe advertised",We wanted to use the gates in a standard hallway and according to the measurements it should have worked. We ended up having to use both extensions on one gate to get it to fit across the hallway and Babyage sent us additional extensions for the other gate but they are in black. The gate itself is good and easy to use.
5,Does the job well!,"This is a really good deal. I really liked that the gates come with extensions. I'm glad I opted for the swing gate since climbing over them several times a day isn't really an option. We spend most of our time on the second floor of a 3 story townhouse, so we are continuously going through these gates. They work well, and close automatically which is nice. They also swing in and out, so they are easy to use regardless of which way you approach them. I would recommend this set of gates to others."
5,Excellent buy!,"We bought these gates for our grandchild and are very happy with them. They are sturdy, attractive, and easy to install. The extensions were simple to attach. We didn't want to drill into the walls, so we used them in doorways that accessed the stairs.I love being able to walk through the gate instead of climbing over it, particularly when carrying a child or a load of laundry. However, if you are feeling agile, they are not too high!"
3,not wide enough ....need extra extensions....,Not wide enough. The two extensions are there for a reason. I am in the process to buy two more extensions.
1,Why did she bother? Why did I bother?,"Why on earth write a sequel to one of the most abysmal Regencies I've read? A Touch of Magic was so awful it was embarrassing, even more so when Miller revealed her complete lack of research at the end, not only on the period but on English inheritance law generally.The illegitimate offspring of an aristocrat CANNOT inherit his title, so Miller's premise is sunk before she starts. But beyond that, her characters are poor and the plot completely incredible. Don't waste your money - go and read a Mary Balogh or a Patricia Oliver instead."
1,Unbelievable!,"No, no, no, no, NO! Not credible, the author does not have the first idea of accuracy - and when someone gets such a major point wrong in a story, especially something which is as important to the plot as Liam inheriting the Earldom, I just can't read it. Dreadful book, lousy research, lazy author.Read something else."
3,one song,"Fan of Van Helden but truth be told I just wanted ""My My My"". Not his best work but I don't think he's out to impress anybody just pump tracks."
2,Armand's On Vacation,"Since the first time I heard Witch Doktor, I've been following Armand buying and collecting most of his albums and remixes. I have a huge collection of Armand's work, but this is his WORST album to date. I heard it twice and still found it awful. My My My and Hear My Name really came from his last album NY: A Mix Odyssey. Besides these tracks the only decent track is When The Lights Go Down and it's the club mix that's good. I really hate to say it, but this album sucks!!!"
4,Hmm...,"I'm a high school sophomore, it's my summer vacation, and I'm trying to prevent my brain from atrophying any further. So I read this book.And I said, ""hmmm.""It requires thought occasionally, but nothing too mind boggling, even for a high school student with no background in physics except for basic classical physics taught in 9th grade. But it's turned on my interest in physics, so I dug out all my brother's old college texts, and read his physics textbooks, and some of my chemistry textbooks as well. It's fairly understandable, but I think it'd be improved further if equations WERE included, as mathematically, these theories would be better explained and more easily understood.Then I read this book again. With equations noted in the margins, notes written in a little notebook. Much more understandable.And said, ""Hmm."""
5,Astoundingly informitive but easy to understand,"I had to do a report on Mr. Hawking's book. When I read it I was amazed by the complex subjects he covered, and I followed it all even though I am in high school with no previous Physics education. So people gave it a bad report because of there ignorence to new ideas, even going as far as to give it one star for the appearence of the cover without ever opening the book. I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest in where we came from and where we are going.I ask you, even if you are not a science buff, to read this just for an understanding of the universe."
4,Opened My Mind,I wish that I would not have been intimidated by this book. Hawking is a master at making difficult and very abstract ideas comprehendible. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
3,"Very good, but you must have some scientific knowledge","The book is absolutely fascinating if you can actually understand it. Hawnking does simplify things quite a bit, but when you realize the complexity of what he is explaining, it can still be rather difficult to understand. I recommend the book to people who have at the very least some college science classes. Otherwise this is going to fly straight over your head."
5,Always fascinating.,"I'm the only person I know that's fascinated with physics. When I attempted to discuss some of the theories in the book with my love ones, I was greeted with rolled eyes and yawns. Can you believe the audacity of some people? What happened to good manners? Okay, I'm not being serious. I don't expect people to share my interests. It's just that this book excited me to the point of wanting discourse. It kind of helps the knowledge sink in more.Every light bulb moment I had while reading ""A Brief History of Time"" left me feeling triumphant, and there were many of those moments. I think that fact speaks well of Mr. Hawking's ability to simplify the abstruse."
3,If you're into physics,"Dr. Hawking is one smart cookie and has sold more books on physics that Madonna has about sex. However, if you are like me and have never had a physics class, I would strongly recommend the ""Illustrated Brief History of Time"". The updates and illustrations make understanding the subjects easier. I would also recommend ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" over the original BHoT."
1,A Meaningless Title,"Think about it; how can we speak about the history of time? It makes no sense whatsoever.Time, for want of a better analogy is like a river in which history unfolds, but time itself has no history; how can it.Obviously, Hawking had to have known this, but the title is catchy and he must have laughed all the way to the Bank at the millions of people who fell for it and came away believing that they now had a better understanding of the history of time after reading his book."
2,Interseristing Ideas...flawed conclusions,"This is an interesting book, and if you like Physics it does present many fascinating ideas for you to ponder, like time travel, evaporating black holes, and the expansion of the universe. My problem is that it doesn't lead anywhere, and the authors grandiose statements really contradict what his own data suggests.....others, avowed atheists like Carl Sagan have gotten ahold of this work and tried to twist it into proving that God does not exist, however; even the author reflects that these theories actually confirm the existence of a creator. It seems his brilliant mind cannot make the final leap that his theories suggest."
3,Just an amusing fiction,"I'm an average girl with quite average education in Accounting. I did not like this book a lot. The same things I have read in my 5th grade book about astronomy and physics. The book talks about common sense, well known to to the educated person, things and sometimes questionable examples. Say, the test with the clocks on the tower. He says that clock on the tower ticks slowly because time is less dense far from the planet. What about clocks mechanics? Maybe less gravity on the top of the tower makes parts of the clock move more freely....Anyways, I have not learn anything new from the book, just reviewed the staff I've learned in the mid-school.Quite amusing, though:))"
1,Very Interesting,"... At the present time I am studying Physics at 'A' level, which,although it helped me to understand a lot of what was going on in thebook it was nontheless a bit confusing in places, especially, I found,in the last three chapters. Although Steven Hawking has indeed cutout an incrediable ammount of the jargon in this book it is still anadvantage to know at least the basics of Physics and of physicsrelated subjects, if you don't you will find this book a bit of a hardread. However, this is a very intresting book and I definatly recomendit to anyone studying physics at any level (It has certainly helped mein my studies) This book is generally good reading for all but is abit tough in places. Especially useful to anyone studying physics."
5,Easy to understand and very enlightening.,"This is a very good book, written well, covering many interesting aspects of astrophysics. I think even people who are not into astrophysics would find the material of this book extremely interesting. Probably the best non-fiction book I have read."
4,Leaves you in awe,"book that sold millions of copies and one wonders how many people read it and of those, how many actually understood it all. I have a scientific education (chemistry), but I frankly admit I did not get it all. It is difficult to explain what is in the book, but is in essence about where we came from and what we are heading to with regard to the universe, time, space and matter. The book is very well written, with a sense of humor and trying to explain the nearly inexplicable to the layman; I could follow large chunks of the text, but sometimes it is just too difficult to comprehend. This made me think: is Stephen Hawking's disadvantage (being locked up in his own body) also his disadvantage? He probably has more time than most people to turn into himself and contemplate on such extremely complex items as black holes, wormholes and the (in)finity of the universe. A book that leaves you in awe."
3,Nice book about time an space,"It is very informative book about creation of our universe. Eventhough the book was used but the price was very affordable. The only thing the shipment charge was much more than the price of the book. Book was in very good condition. Although I paid more for delivery. I didin't know for any reason took long time to receive the book. Definitely I recommend this book to others. But if they want to purchase from this seller, they have to mention delivery time. unless if you need it within up to one week don't go with this seller.But of course the subject and contents of the book very scientific and precious"
2,Title is Misleading (Is it supposed to be funny?),"I listened to this book on a long car trip over the holiday... and I hesitate to admit it, but I was unimpressed. It was an older edition borrowed from the library, perhaps the first edition, and the narrator was just awful. He mispronounced many words, and I heard him use incorrect words (if they weren't, the sentences made absolutely no sense, such as saying ""neuron"" instead of ""neutron"")I also thought the book was disorganized and was trying to be too many things, therefore failing to give proper attention to any one theme. I feel like I should have read this book when it was first published to be impressed with Hawking's overview of physics and cosmology. As it was, I have read or heard all these concepts explained much more concisely from other sources."
4,Did God Create the Universe?,"I've read several of Stephen's books and found them excellent - and challenging. One theory of his I saw (or read) suggested that God didn't create the universe. His logic was impeccable.But I wonder, if when the universe was created, did the Universe create God?Food for thought."
5,An understandable way to explain science,"Hi everybody, I love reading this book. I've taken clases about quantum and relativist mechanics and it was difficult to me to understand, but thanks to Stephen Hawkings now it is easier to me. I advice you to read it, it is amazing and you won't stop reading until finishing it."
3,Hook this book up.,Stephan Hawking describes the universe to us from a point of view that deserves much respect. His arguement and explanations penetrate deep into the laws of nature. Why things are the way they are because they are are some of the explanations put forth by the most brilliant man in this millenium! His humiliation and humor brings live to this otherwise technical review.
2,brief History of Time,This book was touted as being written for those of us with limited knowledge of physics and astrophysics. Perhaps it is and my knowledge is just too limited. I had a serious problem following Dr Hawking.
3,Bumpy RIDE!!!!!!!,"Hawkins may provide amazing insight into Astrophysics and have a Brillant Mind. However, he does a medicore job in explaining things and his writting style is often ""choppy"" and hard to read. He just does not expand on things well. The concepts in the book can be hard to grasp and the writting can make it very hard to stay focus.I find other authors to be a much better selection like Neil Tyson with equal insight for the layman.The book does provide alot of amazing insight into things like Black Holes, Time Travel, Entropy, Relativity and other cosmic delights."
3,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book, however I couldn't. I have had this for over a year now and have yet to finish it, it just doesn't catch my attention. I am an Electrical Engineer so I have the technical background to understand this type of material, it just lacks something to keep the attention. There is a lot of useful information in this book, and more power to you if you can wade through it without falling asleep."
3,Uneven level of detail,"The first chapters of the book are nice preliminary material for the more advanced subjects. However, starting from chapter 3, when the more complex arguments are discussed, Mr Hawking does not spend much time and detail to introduce difficult concepts. He just talks about black holes, virtual particles, strings, symmetry and higher dimensions as one can talk about apples.I had the feeling that he switched from the really basic to the really advanced without providing the necessary logical connection and intermediate steps.I think this is a missed opportunity."
3,"It's not THAT good, nor is it THAT easy to read.","I don't care what anyone says, that book was not easy to get through. I have a degree in Math, and he does not give this stuff in layman's terms. Most of it, will eventually make sense if you can wrap your head around the hard to grasp principles, but he keeps adding more, and more to the theories and he will definitely lose you at some point.Now don't get me wrong, it's obvious that we are dealing with complicated stuff, and he needs to discuss these things, but I just don't want you to think that this is an easy read. It's a necessary read, and I DO recommend you buy it, but don't think it will be easy."
4,"It's like my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner said to me: ""Said.""","I got bogged down on page eighty or something, about the cooling of the universe after expansion. I spent about twenty minutes reading and re-reading it only to be told on the next page it was a redundant theory anyway.Hawking retracted his theory about time's arrow reversing if the universe was to contract. He suggested time would go into reverse with food going out of the mouth and back onto the plate again. I thought it was a little fanciful. You don't need theoretical quantum physics for that anyway, just a combination of my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner and alcohol."
3,not useful,I purchased this for a college class and never opened the book. The vendor sent me the book I ordered at a very good price. I can't complain about the vendor at all. The content of the book? Maybe you'll like it/use it. It's sitting on my coffee table unopened.
1,Excellent Book - without the last chapter!,"Here is the last chapter by French author Maurice, Dr. Bucaille,""The Bible, the Qu'ran and Science: The Holy Scriptures Examined in the Light of Modern Knowledge."" This is available at amazon.If you are lost by reading Carl Sagan or Hawking, read the answer in the above book. Most of the authors are like very good soccer player, they take the ball, maneuver very nice moves, people cheers.. but when it is time to score a goal, they shoot too wide. This book is no exception."
4,A great Book,"This great book I read years ago. Hawkin being an internationally acclaimed scientists has used the best of his knowledge and skill in this book. Besides, he has precisely depicted a brief history of science too. This combination of history and science has made this book exceptional. I have read his recent book also that is not that interesting. One aspect fascinated me much that was description of solar system and the thought of ancient people about the rotation of the earth. Moreover this book questions the Holy Bible."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in this book and don't understand its success. I am a well-educated person with a science background and I was able to grasp only about 80% of what he talked about.The book wasn't well written. One of the most frustrating things he did -mainly in the first few chapters- was explain a theory and then, a few pages later, tell you that it had been disproved. Some things he explains in great detail and others he does not. The illustrations aren't very helpful. I also was a little sick of all his personal interjections - he thinks quite highly of himself. Obviously, the man is a world-renowned physicist, so you would think he wouldn't need to toot his own horn, but..."
3,"Overrated - Nevertheless, worth reading","When I first picked up this book, I expected much more. Hawking uses simple language to explain extremely complicated theories (relativity, uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics, GUTs) and I applaud the absense of mathematical equations (except one, E=mc^2). However, in my opinion, Hawking's explanations on some key cosmological points are sometimes too concise, whereas on the other hand too much time is spent on other topics such as particle theory. This book did not captivate me as much as it should have, despite reading it twice."
4,A Really Brief History Of Time,"A Brief History Of Time sums up all the universe's time into one complete book. It goes all the way from the big bang, to where future theories come into play. Hawking does a great job explaining older theories and also telling why they were wrong or proven incorrect. Then he also tells of his work about black holes and his search for the ultimate theory of the universe. Many of the complex equations are shown in pictures and examples that are easy to follow. This book is for anyone interested in space travel, black holes, or anything of the sort."
4,I am 14 and I loved it and understood it!,"I loved it.I think Hawking explained things in a fairly easy way and I think it helped a lot.I like the way Hawking compared complicated matters to everyday events.I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't understand evrything but it was very intresting.This was the first book I read about cosmology and I think reading this book first helped me beacuase it was so interesting and so fairly understandable.Jake Broadway,FL"
4,A good read but still a bit hard on the mind,"I agree with Amazon that this is an extreemly intresting book depicting how the universe began and predicting possibilities of how it will end. An intresting and somewhat disturbing subject. However, At the present time I am studying Physics at 'A' level, which, although it helped me to understand a lot of what was going on in the book it was nontheless a bit confusing in places, especially, I found, in the last three chapters. Although Steven Hawking has indeed cut out an incrediable ammount of the jargon in this book it is still an advantage to know at least the basics of Physics and of physics related subjects, if you don't you will find this book a bit of a hard read. However, this is a very intresting book and I definatly recomend it to anyone studying physics at any level (It has certainly helped me in my studies) This book is generally good reading for all but is a bit tough in places. Especially useful to anyone studying physics."
3,Hawking was off a bit,"The book in witch Mr Hawking says it will be possible to achieve a complete and correct theory for explaining the whole universe behavior. This theory, says Hawking in ""Brief .."", will be able to explain even the origin of the own theory! Phisic laws will explain where the Phisic laws come from! Haven't the Genious of Stephen Hawking never heard about the Godel's Theorem? The book motive us to the search of the impossible Completeness and Soundness of a theory."
4,Stephen Hawking - A Brief History of Time - 4 / 5,"Stephen Hawking knows what he is talking about. I am absolutely amazed that other reviewers have had the audacity to question his brilliance. That alone proves their ignorance.This book's content is wonderful. Hawking quite obviously knows his stuff, but he's a physicist, not a writer. This is apparent in some places. He deals with mind-boggling subjects, and although he tries to explain it at a level the common person could understand, it's not always accomplished. And it's no all his fault; some of the subject matter he discusses is very difficult to grasp.Overall, the book is filled with enough information to keep most people who aren't phyiscs majors happy, but be forewarned, it is not the easiest read out there."
2,Lost in Space,"It takes a scientist to get through this book as well as someone with a lot of patience. On top of all the science and mathematics, the book moves slowly and the text is rather dry."
3,"Intense and deep, yet thoughtfully educational and readable","I just finished this book and have to say that this is one of the more thought prevoking books I've ever read. Hawking starts off slowly, and then the next thing you know, you are totally engulfed in quantum physics, black holes that aren't really black, relativity, the uncertainty principle, the universe with and without boundaries and more! Although this addresses some very technical and difficult subjects it's very readable. This one will definitely leave you with some things to think about and wanting more. It can take you from an immature uneducated concept of our universe and introduce you to our magnificently complex, immense universe. I think it helps to put in perspective the fact that there's more to life and the universe than what we see every day. As God put Job into his place, so too this will help us to relieve us of our anthropocentric pride and cause us to gaze in wonder into the heavens."
2,It was good around it's time and still a classic but move on,All my respect Hawking but his book is a breif history of our time i think that there is other books that we lay people should read like Elegant Universe by Brain Grene Vision of the 21st Century by Michio Kaku Kip Thorne's Black Hole and Time warps but i think what keeps the book going is how Stephen Hawking explains everything in a story not like lecture and one thing three kind of books that never get outdated is The Bible Math Books and Physics Books
5,Loved it,"Stephen Hawking makes physics fun and understandable--yes, you may have to read a few chapters a couple of times--but this book might make you actually want to put forth that effort. Besides, you feel really cool learning about electrons while watching your children at the park."
4,Thought provoking and interesting book,This is a very thought provoking book -- though is not a page-turner. After reading one page you will be forced to think about the concepts within for 3-4 minutes before making your way to the next page. It will make you think about things that you don't want to think about and the book discusses topics that are extremely interesting.
1,unintelligible,"History will look back at this best selling book and here is what it should say: This book is very lucid to those who have not read it, but it is quite unintelligible to those who have. Buy this book, it doesn't cost that much, to see how a supposedly great scientist cannot put together a coherent thought on paper. It you want to read clear scientific writing, read Lev Landau and then compare to this tripe by Hawking."
3,"Put it on your bookshelf, to impress your date","People say that what you read is what you are, and therefor, you can tell about the charector of a person by examing his bookshelf. Well, this book is a great bookshelf book. To put it on your bookshelf so your date think your intelligent, would be a great use for it. It is not a ""Science book for the masses"" like some had refered to it. It's possible that something happened in the transtlation to Hebrew, but this book was hard-to-read and boring and there are better books in the subject.This book is a must on every bookshelf, but from the wrong reasons."
1,Not interesting,"The book is quite dull. It oversimplifies the physics and the ideas borrowed from engineering, geology, biology, and human history."
3,A thoughtful book,"Since todays science is focused upon external events it becomes a mechanistic science. Therefore Stephens involvment of a conceptualized creator fails. The concept fails at these points. The creator to be an external entity setting up the expected parameters then hitting the create-button wich would make the universes evolvment according to the parameters originally set. Stephens argument of a universe without beginning excludes this creator due to Stephens own concept of the creator. Tho' this book gives a good idea about how the universe proceeds according to thought rules, but could have been more clear upon our own interpretation with our surrounding world. Since we are the thinkers of this world, God would be the concept among those thoughts, but there we also tend to distinct ourself from that source... wich seems irrational."
2,Too complex for the curious minded...,"I was very interested in reading this book because of its reviews and subject, but reading it wasn't what i hoped for. This book is not very reader friendly. It seems that the only people able to understand the majority of what he gets into(i.e: equations,terms,subjects) would only be understood by people who have a degree in the subject. I've taken a few college classes in astronomy and enjoyed the subject very much, but seriously, i simply finished the second half of the book just to complete it. I went through the first half with hopes of it getting easier or better. There is a lot of information given, but it's really hard to understand or comprehend for anyone who doesn't have a background in astronomy."
5,Stephen Hawking has blown my mind to pieces.,"In just shy of 200 pages Stephen Hawking hasblown my mind to pieces. _A Brief History_ is atrip as fast and disorienting as any rollercosterI have ever ridden. Pure physics hits you fullin the face, boggling your mind with fourth dimensions,singularities, and charmed quarks. But it extendsbeyond the science. Philosophy abounds in its pages.Zen koans lurk just beneath the surface ofscientific reasoning.And in between the words, you catch a glimpse ofthe inner workings of one of the greatest minds ofour time."
2,"""C"", ""P"", and ""T""? What tha...","I would have to say that overall I was a bit disappointed in this book. It was a little too technical and too theoretical for simple minded little me. I got woosey trying to follow such things as ""1/2 Spin"" and ""Imaginary Time"". I was, though, pleasantly surprised at Mr. Hawking's self-depricating and humorous writing style. A discussion of the ""Casimir Effect"" would make a great ice breaker at an office party, though. :-)"
2,MAYBE WORTH THE EFFORT FO SOME BUT...,"ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ."
2,Had to read it for Physics class. -Not bad,I read this for extra credit in my College Physics class. It was hard to understand at times but overall it made sense. Hawking tries to give an explanation of where we came from and where we are going. Unless you are interested in Physics/Space I would def. skip this.
3,It'll do in a pinch,"Hawking is obviously a gifted writer, and I have few complaints about his style. However, this is more a popularization of a cosmology, especially black holes, than anything else. IIRC, he devotes two entire chapters to black holes. But they're popular, and once something he did a lot of ""research"" on, so who can blame him for wanting to appeal to the masses? Still, the reader will not leave this book with any deepened understanding of physics. A quick and easy read, but Hawking needs to write a GOOD popularization now."
2,A good book for a rocket scientist.,"Complex beyond words. Interesting in part.The math equations were far beyond me and probably most other college graduates.I recently read ""Theory Of Everything"" by the same scientist and I found far more readible and much easier to understand.I do not recommend this book for anyone who is not highly knowledgeable in science and complex mathematical equations."
4,Excellent introduction to the universe and all that matter,"The leading edge thinking of Stephen Hawking is lucidly expressed with rare wit and humor, the likes of which you don't expect from such a brilliant mind.""A Brief History"" - is just that - Hawking covers concepts ranging from the idea that the flat Earth is resting on the back of a giant tortoise - to black holes and gray matter. It is updated from the original text to include the most recent theories of time travel and worm holes.The book was first written in 1988 and in the world of physics - a lot has happened in that time. If you read the original - you may want to brush up by reading this one, too.You don't need more than curiosity to enjoy this book. Though you are taken quite deeply into the realms of spinning quarks and out to the far reaches of the edges of the expanding universe - you are lead there in terms that are easily understood.No one can take you further - no one stretches your imagination more - than Stephen Hawking."
3,Advanced Physics for Laymen?,"In this book, Stephen Hawking describes advanced developments on General Relativity and Cosmology (including theories on Black Holes, including quantum effects). Although his research is indeed brilliant, the book itself is not: it is not that easy to read, even though it is aimed for laymen.As for the subject of time, I would recommended ""From Eternity to Here"", from Sean Carroll."
5,Truly Commendable,"A Brief History of Time was written by Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant physicists ever known, and he helps the common man to comprehend the unfathomable concepts of the universe. The best aspect of this book is that, even the most scientific theory is explained to us in a very uncomplicated style. It's truly commendable that he includes God as he rightly says ""the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of `the mind of God'."""
5,Awsome...totally enlightening,This book was a total eye opener. It has helped me to understand better the world that we live in. Hawking takes the most complicated of topics and puts them in terms that the average joe can understand...great job Steven!
5,The most fantastic physics book i have ever read!!!,"When I started to read this book i thought that this is science fiction book i am reading, so interesting it was. I finished it within three day without being able to stop. Stephen managed to answer almost all the fundamental questions i had asked myself before, in a very simple and interesting manner!Keep on Stephen!"
3,Question for whoever runs this listing,"Part of the listing says ""Yeast free"", but the bottle says""yeast based"". It can't be both!Please verify and correct your listing!"
1,DISAPPOINTED.....,This is the same exact book with a different title as Prophecy of the Stones. My neice loved Prophecy of the Stones and was so excited for what we thought was the sequel and was crushed when we finally got the book and found it was the same. Very misleading and decieving if you ask me to put the same book out with a new title.
1,Awful,"I'm sorry. Maybe it was better in French than in English, but I found this book predictable and tedious. The characters have little depth and the plot--wait, there isn't one good enough to be CALLED a plot."
3,Based on Richard Hackborn of HP,"The ""Gamesman"" hero of the book is Richard Hackborn, who 25 years later recruited Carly Fiorina to run Hewlett-Packard."
3,Not for programmers,"Haven't read the whole book since I already knew MIDP 1.0, and the only reason I bought this one was that at the time I bought it was the only book I could find on MIDP 2.0. This rating will only be based on the more advanced stuff (APIs in MIDP 2.0). The author spend a lot of time talking about you can do with MIDP 2.0 and how to code some different applications which I think is covered pretty well. However, the applications I have looked at does not work. There are even classes that are missing, as well as other errors in the examples. I don't think anyone learning java wants to deal with this. ""Teach yourself java with J2ME in 21 days"" is a very good book if you know a little bit of programming, but are new to j2me."
2,"Not for programmers, may be for standards' fans !","This book is more like a standards specification. The author goes on and on in circles without getting to the heart of the matter quickly. For example the first example, is discussed after 50 pages of boring presentation. And yet, the example is not a simple smooth starting point. No, it's a simple game !I really and truly regret the money I wasted on this book."
5,Very servicable short history.,"A very servicable, highly readable short political history of the Roman Catholic Church, as outlined in the careers of its popes. The author maintains a commendable objectivity concerning the merits and failings of the various members of this group, among them saints, dullards, libertines, and tyrants. Highly recommended for those who want a solid, well-balanced overview."
5,Awesome invention,Knew I chose correctly when my wife said she liked it! It's cheap and easy to install. Helps keep more bugs outside. Would definately recommend this to anyone who owns a camper.
2,"Concept A+, Execution D-","Great idea, but needs to be tweaked. First off, the shaft that goes through the rubber grommet should be square as should the hole in the grommet so that the handle will stay in the horizontal flat position. With everyone and their dog using this, the handle will get pointed sideways and every which way. Second, there should be a pin on the back side, so that the handle cannot be pulled, which will make it miss the handle on the screen door completely or worse, popping off the cap on the opposite side, to be lost forever in the lawn. I would not purchase this item in its present design again."
2,RV Screen Door opener,"Simple gadget that if it worked, would be great. Real waste of money and time."
5,"A sweeping, rapturous tale of passion","Never To Love is a powerful love story and an original medieval era fantasy novel by Mary Ann Carman. A prince and a witch find their paths star-crossed in a land torn apart by war and malicious sorcery. A sweeping, rapturous tale of passion, revenge, and the desperate quest to save a kingdom, Never To Love is especially commended to the attention of both historical fiction fans and fantasy enthusiasts."
2,This stinks.,"Yuck! If this was the first stereolab CD I ever heard, I never would have bought another. This album stinks! Just listened to it again and I like it less the second round. I rather enjoyed the last several releases, but this album is just annoying to listen to; very electronic; fake percussion that went out in the 80s, and a freaky stereo effect that is fatiguing. What has happened to my favorite band? It's sad to see a great band in decline."
1,"Euro-Trash, Stereolab-style","Unfocused music has no parlay on pretensions drab hooks and pseudo-groove fakeness. Stereolab's 'Margerine Eclipse' is a Francophile stab at Euro-Hip hop with no winning results. Andy Ramsay, Simon Johns, and Tim Gane disappoint in almost every track of this beat heavy and rhythmically dead CD.The convoluted CD mixes, and which ironically starts optimistically, and ends with a thud and a dud. Stereolab's disappointing release contains 3 Francophone songs that do nothing to raise the Anglophonic songs that loiter on `Margerine Eclipse'. Laetitia Sadler is a beautifully voiced chanteuse with clear aspirations of playing beyond Stereolab. Her notes reach highs and lows that show Stereolab's limits early within `Vonal Decision', `Need to Be', and `Margerine-Melodie'. Clearly, Stereolab's days are numbered...Skip this tedious bit. Unless you are interested n being enticed by the succulent voice of Laetitia Sadler, this Cd is NOT worth it..."
4,Japan import offers integral bonus track,"The bonus track on this Japanese release, La Spirale, completely suits this album, perfectly placed at track 10 out of the 13 songs instead of tacked on the end as most Japan releases tend to do with their bonus tracks. Anywaay, of course the album is brilliant. I love how they use the element of darkness in their pop. Yes, of course they have their happy songs on the album and I love those almost as much, but the darker, more reflective colors are what make the album so interesting for me at least. Real original dark pop. Awesome."
4,"really good, but...","this band makes cute background music for a sunny day. Other than that, it has basically no value at all."
3,"OK, but ultimately a bit disappointing considering their reputation.","Not exactly what I expected. I haven't been a fan of Stereolab, so jumped in feet first with this album. The first few tracks are great. Love the French flavor of the singer, but the music itself lacks warmth. I must go back and explore the earlier recordings, as the bits I have heard from them appear to have a little more humanity to this release."
1,"Uhh...Wow, let's give one word that describes this umm...SAD","No not literally sad, I mean what kind of a sick person made this. I did cry because I thought, what kind of people would do such a cruel thing. Yeah I don't even know why I watched it. I was bored and had nothing else to do so I went into my little seven year old brothers room. Let's just say MY MOOD DIDN'T IMPROVE MUCH. So take my advice...just buy or rent...SOMETHING ELSE! Go watch UNBREAKABLE or SIGNS or the normal RoTK. I mean this is just depressing. This movie makes BARNEY i repeat BARNEY look like WILL SMITH! So all I'm saying is I'd rather watch sesame street than this. NO SERIOUSLY. Now go rent or buy anM. NIGHT SHYAMALANmovie. You'll thank me for it."
1,nice animated kid's movie,"It's not a bad movie. Most people who see it seem to like it. Unless, of course, they've read the books, and realize that Hobbits don't speak in some stilted old fashioned language w/ thee's and thou's, Aragorn respects and understands Gandalf's advice, Sam does NOT find the Ring lying on the ground outside the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Orcs don't sing, Gandalf knows more than the viewers about what is going on and is an awful choice for narrator, etc, etc... So, they rewrote the story and changed the characters. This is NOT Tolkien's Return of the King. It is an interesting movie for kids though, and I'm sure many kids enjoy watching it. In their defence, Eowyn is ok, and Frodo and Sam's trip thru Mordor is ok, barring the beginning and end. I think they did a much better job on the Hobbit and should have stopped there."
3,"Ok, but adulterates the story.","This movie was a bit too lighthearted to truly reflect the books that it was based on. It also grossly alters some of the characters in a way that would offend anyone truly familiar with the books (Aragorn, in particular, is robbed of a fairly substantial portion of his dignity and majesty). This is decent entertainment if you don't take the series seriously, but if you are one of those people that knows every plot twist in the books, this movie suffers from the typical malaise of movies based on books with plots too complicated to really stuff into the amount of time a movie gives it. Good for kids, but for serious Tokien fans, don't bother."
4,Great for Kids who aren't ready for the Peter Jackson trilogy,"My boys (ages 5 and 7) have seen ads for the Peter Jackson trilogy, heard about it from classmates, etc. and were desperate to see The Lord of the Rings. My husband and I loved the trilogy but strongly feel they are far too young for the Peter Jackson version. I remembered watching the Hobbit on tv in the 70's and went looking for it and found this gem as well. Yes, the music is cheesy and very 70's--and yes, it's a very hurried summary of a very complex movie--but my children LOVE it. It is their current favorite movie and I can't wait until they can read the books and someday seen the ""grown-up"" trilogy. So, I'd say--valid criticisms aside--this movie succeeds admirably in allowing younger kids some access to the Tolkien world."
3,Two things worth looking at,"As a film, not terribly good, but it has two shining features:1. The best Sam of any filmic adaptation I've seen yet. He's brave and loyal, and saves the day. He does not come off as totally dependent on Frodo.2. The goblin marching song, ""Where There's a Whip There's a Way."" Catchy and funny, sung by a male choir."
5,The Return of the King,"'The Return of the King' is a wonderful animated movie classic by Rankin/Bass and is a must-own. Like its prelude 'The Hobbit', 'The Return of the King' has a lot of adventure and fantasy in it. It may not follow author J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' book trilogy that well, but that doesn't mean that it is a bad movie. The animation, sound effects, and voice acting in this spectacular movie are all outstanding! I highly recommend you buy 'The Return of the King' animated movie by Rankin/Bass!"
1,Very Disappointing!,"After watching Baskhi's ""The Lord Of The Rings"" (which I enjoyed thoroughly) I was expecting ""The Return Of The King"" to be the sequel. It certainly was not!! What with the Glen Yarbrough music, the unfaithful story telling, the obvious breaks for commericals and the cost of the DVD, I was very disappointed."
1,Worse than Dreadful,"Without doubt, this is THE WORST adaptation of any Tolkien work that I have ever seen. It attempted to be a conclusion for the Lord of the Rings movie cycle that Bakshi never finished. While Bakshi's movie wasn't great, it wasn't bad either. This, however, is absolutely dreadful. I could probably add that I consider this the worst movie I've ever seen."
1,sigh...,"I was not impressed with this video. The hobbit is one of my all time favorite videos and I have seen it many times, but I found it a struggle to sit through The Return of the King even once. It is filled with poorly done songs, with little or no action to tie them together."
1,I wish I could RETURN this KING,I hated this video. It was a childish adaptation. The dark sections (such as orcs and nazgul) were rendered as cartoon sillies. Whose bright idea was it to get GlennYarborough to sing all the drippy songs that dominate and ruin this story?
3,TV special from Rankin/Bass,"Another TV special from Rankin/Bass. They did this to ""complete"" the story after the ""Lord Of The Rings"" (by Bakshi) after that movie ended without including anything from the third book."
2,Not Bad...Not Good,"I have fond memories of this movie as a child. Upon watching it again as an adult I can see I was watching this through some very heavily tinted rose colored glasses.The animation is passable - certainlylacking by today's standards but the part that will test your mettle will be the singing. Wow. Just wow. It's really bad, I don't remember it being this bad as a kid but if you can stomach the singing you can be treated to certain plot lines and elements missing from the far far superior Jackson film including the ending that Tolkien had in his book with Gollum dancing off the cliff.If you saw this as a child I encourage you to watch it again. Otherwise stick to Jackson's version. You'll be a lot happier and your ears will not be marred by such danceable hits as ""The Ring of Doom."" and ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers."""
1,SKIP IT!,"WOW! This has to be one of the worst animated stories I have ever seen. It is so different from the book that the plot is almost unintelligable! Then there is that sappy music! My goodness what tripe! SKIP IT! And hope that the movie, currently in production will make up for this travesty. I would have given it is -5 stars if that was possible!"
2,"Bad transfer, but the kids will like it...","Not much to say here about the animated version of the final chapter in the classic series. While not entirely loyal to the book, this has its (few) moments, but they are hidden within some ghastly monsters, bad-looking fight scenes and very forgettable songs. Animated musicals are very rarely pulled off well outside of Disney and this is the prime example. The final encounter with Gollum is exciting, but by then everyone but the kiddies will be asleep."
2,Only for curious Tolkien fan,"If you read the entire Lord of the Rings and are interested in seeing an interpretation of the story, check this out. I must warn you, it contains some very PAINFUL to listen to songs. The style is sort of like a Christmas cartoon. The hobbits look like Santa's elves. Did I mention the music is horrible?"
2,Sense of closure but that's it,"The box says that tis is supposed to be a sequel to The Hobbit. Let me tell you if the only background for this movie you have is seeing the Hobbit you are going to be in trouble.I got this movie because I had just watched Ralph Bakshi's amazing film the Lord of the Rings. That movie is a must-see for any Tolkien fan. The problem is tha the movie ends before the story is over. I think a sequel was anticipated but never happened. So, needing some closure, I picked up the Return of the King to end th estory. The characters aren't even comparable toBakshi's. Roddy MacDowell (an amazing actor) was terrible as Samwise, he was trying to turn the lovable bumkin into Hamlet. The Orcs and Ring Wraiths aren't frightening. Gandalf's character hasn't changed since The Hobbit and every three minutes tehy break into a mindless song (How many times can we hear Frodo of the nine fingers?). This movie is good for a true Tolkien fan but everyone else should just read the book."
2,Sketchy Story,"With unimpressive animation and poor voice acting already a hindrance, the Swiss-cheese plot pretty well doomed this movie. Of course, it would be difficult for anyone to show, much less summarize, the whole of The Hobbit and The Return of the King in just over 90 minutes. Still, the choices Romeo Muller made in adapting the screenplay are questionable at best.The John-Denveresque soundtrack is absolutely horrid, save for ""Where There's a Whip, There's a Way."" Someone should've used that whip on those involved with this film, so it would have been more than just a poor representation of Tolkien's masterpiecce."
4,Lets just say the DVD is better than The Hobbit DVD (Barely),"Ok the only real problem with this DVD is with the inside cover. It has the track listings is for ""The Lord of the Rings"" DVD movie. The DVD itself is about as good as the VHS tape. While I'm not over joyed with the cover picture, at least all of the audio and sound effects are there. (See ""The Hobbit"" DVD reviews!) Remember Tolkien fans this is the only ""Return of the King"" DVD we will have till 2004!~Rob~"
3,Almost good,"I enjoyed the music in this movie, The animation is good, but they do not follow the story line to well. I mean, What happend to aragon in the land of the dead?!? Where are the houses of healing?!? What about the scourging of the shire?!? Sauromon is not in the movie at all! I did enjoy this movie but I would not sugjest it unless you have read the book."
3,"The movie is entertaining, just not anything like the books.","The movie is just about as good as you can get with the story it was based on and understanding the fact that Return of the King is geared toward children, unlike The Lord of the Rings. The makers of this movie used their ""artistic liscense"" quite liberally and left an entertaining, albeit candy-coated version of the original story. If you got a copy of The Hobbit for the kids get this for them too and if your not looking for tolkein's exacting detail just something fun you will like it too."
3,I think that this movie didnt compre to the book.,I think that this book didnt even come close to being the same realm that the 3 book were in. It should of told a lot more about how they got to the places other then they just appear then. But this is a great movie for its time and you should still buy it. I hope that the new movie being made in the British islands will beter compared to the story.
1,I can't believe I watched the whole thing.,"This is a horrible attempt at telling a great story. Rankin/Bass did a decent job with ""The Hobbit"", but this is practically unwatchable for adults. Glen Yarborough's warbly singing with all of the flashbacks is terrible. The characters are too cartoonish, especially Merry and Pippin - they've made them look like morons. Sure they couldn't have done it as well as Bakshi did LOTR, but they could have given it a little more respect. Skip this one and just watch ""The Hobbit"" and LOTR over and over."
5,The one from my childhood,"There is no point in owning this movie for anything other than nostalgia purposes, but that's what I wanted.This is absolutely not a review on the *content* of the movie -- I am giving it five-stars because I wanted the movie they used to show on TV when I was a kid. This is the one with the cheesy ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom!"" song. It's exactly the one they used to show -- obvious commecial breaks and everything.There is not much continuity from the Rankin-Bass ""Hobbit"" to this movie (the Hobbit movie was better at story-telling than this one). There is way too much repetition within this movie. There are so many characters that are not explained at all -- just seen and then dropped. It's all choppy and confusing. And it's very cheesy. But it's exactly like I remembered, and I'm so glad that I get to sing along. My kids think I'm nutsos. So what?"
3,Bizarre interpretation,"The film is entertaining as long as it is watched with an open mind and expectations aren't too high. The story is _generally_ the same but there are many small alterations which weren't really nessecary. The songs are overused in places and the disco orc music is completely unnessecary. On the other hand the backgrounds are drawn wonderfully and some of the characters are well portrayed such as Theoden, Witch King of Angmar and the two watchers in Cirith Ungol."
2,"Some good animation, but disappointing nonetheless!","If you're expecting to really experience Tolkien on film, this isn't it! For some reason, the producers of this version of Book 3 in the LOTR trilogy decided to make major changes in the book. Why? I don't know! For example, King Theoden of Rohan was attacked by the Lord of the Nazguls, right? Not in this version! Here, he just falls from his horse for NO REASON and dies! And Sam & Frodo reached Mount Doom just about the time the battle before the gates of the Morrannon were opened, right? Not here --- in this version, they spent several days wandering inside Mount Doom! Why did they make these silly plot changes?!!"
2,Return of the King is a let-down,"I remember watching the Hobbit for the first time on video, and I absolutely loved it. When I saw the Lord of the Rings as an 8 year old, I loved the animation, and the gore, which was amazing to me. Even now, I still love both movies, but I can't say the same for Return of the King. The Hobbit works fine as a musical adventure, since it is intended for kids. The Lord of the Rings series of books is a much more darker tale, and it is horrible in the movie when they keep pausing for songs. In the Hobbit, where you can get away with kitty-action, in the Return of the King, it takes away from the story, because it is based around a war. All and all, very lame."
1,Mr. Ranger as Angmar? Yogi Bear? Shaggy? Scooby Doo?,"TRUST ME, fans of Tolkien, this production is AWFUL. Poor animation, poor quality, you name it. It's only good because it's so funny to see the voice actors who brought us Shaggy, Scooby Doo, Yogi Bear, Boo Boo, Mr. Ranger and others act out these historic roles. DON'T GET THIS."
1,I couldn't give it zero stars,"The brash idiocy that this movie embodies sickens me to no end. The very idea that Tolkiens work would be crushed into this awful piece of trash bewilders the mind. The music is simply awful, the storyline hopelessly marred and even then pityiful, and the animation is unsuitable for the serious subjects that are considered. I sinscerely hope that anyone who deciedes to watch this video will be doing so either to entertain a very small child or to relentlessly make fun of it."
4,Almost Perfect,I really like this whisk but do have one quibble. The handle is too short by at least an inch. It's fine for my wife but it is annoying to me.
1,Pretension Aplenty,"WLHM had a great idea; to recycle Blue Highways, this time on a boat. However, what made Blue Highways a wonderful read was not the highway or even the van - but the people he encountered on his way. When you travel across America on a boat you don't interact with very many interesting people. The result - a lot of water, shoreline and pretension. I don't which was worse; the author's struggle to complete the journey or my struggle to complete the book."
2,"Much ado, but ultimately not too much","An acquaintence recommended ""River Horse"" in such extravagant terms, that I was tempted to buy it. Fortunately I checked it out of our local library, and saved myself several bucks.The book is a disappointment on any number of levels. Ostensibly about a small boat traveling across the country, the author shows little interest in small boats and regards travel merely as a catalyst for his eratic and shallow musings. The reader would be better served by subscribing to the National Geographic."
1,Very diasappointing,"Least-Heat Moon's earlier books, Blue Highways and Prairy Erth, were terrific. This one is painful. It is self-indulgent, as were his earlier works in parts -- but without the wonderfully clean and accurate observations on humankind that make the other two must-reads. This is a book that seems to have been written to say ""look at me, look at how witty and urbane I am."" Unfortunately, he falls flat, and comes across as merely pompous. Save your money -- give this one a pass."
1,"Long, boring boat trip across America","The late Spiro Agnew (""nattering nabobs of negativism"") would have loved this book's language, even though he would have hated its sentiments. W. L. H-M offers the basic environmentalist's screed, and even though I personally agree with much of it, his is a novel approach: he will try to win your agreement through interminable boredom. If you like pedantry, you'll love this book."
2,"Neat idea, sunk by water-logged prose","The idea behind this book is fascinating: is it possible to go coast-to-coast by water? What do you find along the way? How has riverside America changed in the interstate highway world?Alas, this book is almost unreadable. The writing is pretentious, stilted and overwrought; unnecessary literary devices (most notably the ""Pilotis"" schtick other reviewers have complained about) bog down the narrative, and the boat is barely onto the Erie Canal when you vaguely hope it will sink. I'm rooting for Bill Bryson or (better yet) Calvin Trillin or (even better) Ian Frazier to take this voyage sometime."
3,Need an Atlas,"River Horse is nothing like ""Blue Highways."" Make sure you have an Atlas and Dictionary nearby when reading River Horse. Difficult to follow, difficult to read, and pompous."
1,River travel,"It was interesting. However the author kept sticking in political views that showed he was entirely lacking in knowledge of the how and why politically. I know that his information about the rivers was correct, but his political views, since they were without scholarly foundation, should have been left out. However that is his opinion, but it detracted from the factual story of his trip, and was totally unrelated. He doesn't seem to understand that this country has been under control of the Democrats 90% of the time since 1929. They effectively ran against Hoover until Nixon came along,then continued their Tax and spend tactics until 1994. Clinton continued to fight for runaway spending until the Republicans stopped him. Now he takes credit for the surplus. He should stick to what he knows, boating, until he studies political history with an open mind."
1,Awful Awful Awful,This is one of the worst books I ever read. I hope the author would consider another vocation. May I suggest sleep therapy. The best thing about this bomb is that the pages work well in the out house
5,Vicarious adventure,Its a vicarious adventure to explore the rivers of North America by reading about William Least-Heat Moon's journey.
1,Wonderful subject for a book but...,I wanted to read about the fabulous adventure. I only made it through 30 pages of this book. The author must have read too many ancient texts translated by 19th century academics. This one failed to keep me awake. Perhaps if Pilotis (the anonymous first mate for this voyage) published his diary I would be more interested.
2,River Horse,"What a disappointment after reading Blue Highways -- which this certainly is not! Had Heat-Moon given in a Prologue the tale of him giving up his marriage in order to do this boat trip I certainly wouldn't have read the book. It seemed, as I read it, that I was tempted numerous times to put it down and never pick it up again. There is so much negativism and cynicism with jabs at religion, politics and being an activist for much of the trip. I like to read enjoyable books. So, I say, if you feel you have to read it, check it out of a library."
1,"Least Heat, Most Hot Air","Would someone please introduce Heat Moon to Stephen King's book, ""On Writing""? The man who introduced me to the correlation between the number of calendars and cafe eats (which is 100% accurate even today)has forgotten what it was that made him a readable author. Somewhere along the line, this proud reborn native Amerian began to confuse his roots with a Monty Python version of Shakespearean prose, with the resulting unreadable drivel reeking of pithy arrogance and snobbery. Hey Bill, you are writing about America here - keep it simple, straight and direct and maybe you will catch the atmosphere and mood which is the heart of a story such as this. You've done it before."
3,Interesting and entertaining,"This book chronicles William Least Heat-Moon's attempt to cross America completely by water. Though a simple premise, it is a difficult task. Setting out from New York Harbor with his friend, Pilotus, Least Heat-Moon journeys ever westward using canals, lakes, and rivers. And as he travels he records his thoughts on many subjects from pollution to politics. As with his first book, Blue Highways, Least Heat-Moon also records his conversations with the people he meets along the way.The book is thought-provoking and entertaining. I think it calls to all of us who have dreamed of taking our own voyage of discovery. I'd recommend this and his first book, Blue Highways."
3,Water-Weary Traveler Challenges America's Tributaries,"In the wake of his successful sojourn over the back roads or ""Blue Highways"" of the U.S., author William Least Heat-Moon accomplished an east-to-west journey of a different sort: seven years ago along the inland rivers and waterways, with little time out for other than wearying commentary.Accompanying him on this journey is a seven-headed hydra, a character known simply as Pilotis, who takes on both genders as the plot progresses. He/she represents those who committed themselves to supporting the crew and captain throughout the journey.If you like Heat-Moon's writing, you'll probably enjoy this book. The writer is to be credited for his research, courage, spirit, and fortitude. An excellent writer, he delivers substance, but lacks the popular interest factor found in his first book, Blue Highways, a book far superior to this one."
1,I Didn't Make the Journey,"This book didn't work for me. Far too many meandering ""rivulets"" of thought. I jumped ship a quarter way through and then kept skipping ahead to see if I was judging the book wrongly. The author seemed to be prooving himself as an Important American Writer with his flowery language... Quote:""As unruly, illogical, shifty, and willful as the Missouri is - here's one more river traveler's gambit - it nevertheless gives recompense, and in that country of long reaches and mild bends it returned to us some of the finest riverine landscapes we'd seen...""One final thing it would be helpful if the book visually charted the voyage better for people not familiar with the many backroads and rivers of this country. Very little visual reference was provided and it could have made the trip more exciting!"
2,Throw me a life-jacket,"Nearly drowned! In a river of foamy blather, that is.The intent is certainly there and I can not imagine such a colossal undertaking as boating across America on its river systems. The attention and determination would be considerable.The shortcomings are the overblown wording and self diversions. Something just does not float here. This could have been an exceptional read in the right hands.The 100 plus day adventure begins in New York City.Up the Hudson River to the Erie Canal, across Lake Erie to the Allegheny, down the Ohio, turning north on the Mississippi, then to the nearly forever Missouri River.Portaging over the Continental Divide and continuing onto the Salmon, Snake and Columbia River, Heat-Moon covers over 5,000 river miles. From the Atlantic to the Pacific all by river.There is much to be learned from the author's expedition but with the awkward writing slant, 500 pages becomes a tedious and demanding read."
2,Watch out for the rocks!,"I loved Blue Highways and PrairyErth but to be honest, I found this book a bit of a slog. The author still has a wonderful eye but too much of the book is taken up by passages where he takes his boat up rivers that are just too shallow. As a result, we're treated to innumerable paragraphs about how they have to kept looking out for rocks, have to keep checking the depth finder and how tiring it is. Blah blah blah. And what's more - we find out early on that no, you can't go all the way across America by boat. There are some spots in New York State where they have to haul the boat from lake to lake, so really, what's the point?"
2,"Tedious, thy Name is River Horse","This must have been one very long, boring and tedious trip. It has taken me almost as long to read the book as it took the author to make the trip. I stayed with it because the idea of seeing America from the riverbank was most appealing. I was disappointed and I think the author was too!"
3,"I am glad I read it, but it wasn't up to par.","I first read William Least-Heat Moon's ""Blue Highways"" That one gets five stars from me any day. This one perhaps I had too high an expectation for this book. It read like a list of events. I was glad when I trudged through the last chapter and could move on to something else. I have Heat-Moon's other books and will read them all eventually, but this one put a damper on my enthusiasm for his work. If you are going to read one of his books, get ""Blue Highways"" instead."
5,Beyond Belief,"Product DescriptionThe Moors Murders are the most brutal, senseless and cold blooded killings to have occurred in Great Britain in many years. Between November 1963 and October 1965, Ian Brady, clerk, and Myra Hindley, typist, killed at least three--and possibly as many as five-- young people varying in age from ten to seventeen, for no apparent motive. On May 6, 1966 the two murderers were sentenced to life imprisonment (capital punishment has been abolished in England). Beyond Belief, an uncanny feat of re-creation of the minds, hearts, and motivations of the two killers, is the story of this case. In it Emlyn Williams has achieved superbly his objective: ""The dual accuracy of hisotry and of imaginative understanding."
3,Small con great pro,"I order these and did not recive what was in the picture but what looked like Planet Waves ZM Series RCA. Needles to say they still work great, but have to strip the coax down to the first layer of insulation to fit. But still great sound."
5,Blues at it's best,Great collection of blues legends.Tracks...1)Buddy Guy - Damn Right.

2,Ross does it again!,I have two corp fin books by Ross and company. This book was purchased while studing for the Level I of the CFA exam. The other book was used in graduate school. Both books are sub par in quality and were not cheap either. Save your money. Don't use this text.
2,Very rudimentary,"Topics are not detailed at all. Very basic introductory book. Very simple examples. Therefore, very unrealistic examples. The book does not try to highlight and explain the pitfalls of the topics in corporate finance (ex. CAPM, DCF analysis...)."
2,Worthless Supplement Materials,"The author simply keeps writing (These items will be covered in a future chapter) more than a dozen times per chapter. It gets to be very annoying. Poor writing and poor examples. DO NOT BUY supplementary software either, worthless. If your professor requires this textbook then do not buy anymore than is required."
2,Poorly Written,"I would like to start by saying that my review of this product has nothing to do with the service I received through Amazon. My book was delivered promptly and the packaging was great.I am giving this book a 2 because I feel like it is very poorly written. I use this text book for a finance course in the MBA program. This is my second finance course. This book does a terrible job explaining concepts and the derivations of solutions to problems. I feel like it is not very student/learner friendly. I always do well in my courses and have no problem learning new concepts, but this text has not helped facilitate my understanding of financial concepts. I would not recommend this text book."
2,No cd or access code,Bought as new but it had no cd or access code for online material ended up costing me an extra $35
3,China not the problem,"This scoop is made in China, but that's not the problem. The problem is the exhorbitant price that can only be justified by the ""Rosle"" name. The scoop is unremarkable, though it does not suffer the fatal flaws of many junk scoops out there. The scoop works fine, but it is by no means as special as some reviews suggest. The edge of the scoop isn't particularly sharp, the balls of hard ice cream it scoops are not especially round, ice cream does stick to the scoop, and the brazing on the joint between the scoop and handle is not ground smooth and polished -- it looks like any ordinary, careless weld that was just plated over. This scoop should cost no more than $8."
3,Average,"Cook's Illustrated recommended this ice cream scoop, but I don't understand why. Ice cream sticks to it, and I haven't noticed that it produces curls that are any more or less ""perfect"" than other scoops I've used. I eat ice cream almost every day, and when this scoop is in the dishwasher I find that I'm just as happy to reach for a spoon."
1,Design flaw,"After reading the recommendation in Cook's Illustrated, I ordered this scoop (not from Amazon) and had high expectations. When it arrived, the scoop part twisted a little bit in the handle part. I thought ""maybe I got a lemon"" and asked customer service for a replacement. The replacement scoop arrived yesterday and does the same thing. Clearly a flaw in the design. Now both scoops will go back to the vendor. This is an expensive scoop and I expected it to be flawless like my other utensils from Rösle which are made in Germany. However, this is a piece of junk ""Made in China."""
2,"The Rösle scoop made in China, *not* Germany (incorrect prod desciption)","Received item today and discovered Amazon's product description is flat wrong. Specifically, the Amazon review says, ""All Rösle products are made in Germany, are dishwasher-safe, and carry a lifetime warranty against defects.""The sticker on the ice cream scoop prominently states, ""Made in China"". If I'd known this wasn't made in Germany like my other Rösle producgts, I'd have gotten a Chinese-made Zyliss or Oxo scoop for much, much less.I'm too lazy to return this, so I'll give this product a go. Let's hope that the scoop really is dishwasher-safe and Rösle will honor any defects during a lifetime of use. (e.g., I noticed that the stem is welded to the ice cream scoop. I hope it stands up to my rock-hard ice creams from the deep freezer....)"
5,A very finely made Rosle ice cream scoop.,"Stoutly made. Familiar Rosle handle, short 5/16th"" thick rod from handle to scoop, and expertly crafted scoop proper are all robust. The all important juncture of the 5/16th"" rod to the scoop is both brazed and welded. The welds are in the right place for strength to scoop either right or left handed and the brazing completes the seamless melding of the rod to the scoop. There is a high polish on everything excepting the brushed tubular handle.This is not a 'bells and whistles' kitchen tool, but rather a very well made utilitarian scoop. The balance is exceptional and the distance between the handle and the scoop is short enough to inspire confidence to torque away all day. No, I haven't used it this way but I have scooped some very hard ice cream. This is the scoop I reach for first. I enjoy using it."
2,Annoying inconsistency,Th product features and editorial review spell Germany as the origin of manufacture. But the one I got was made in China.
1,Bible Story 10 Volume Set,Supplier shipped only Volume 1 of a 10 Volume set. I should have received 10 volumes which I did not. Product was returned to Amazon.
2,Died 3 years,"This lens does everything the manufacturer claims. It is sharp, auto focuses well and is easy to use. Unfortunately the lens stopped working after three years."
4,Solid Kit lens,"This lens is an excellent replacement for the kit lens that comes with most cameras.Pros:Quiet even without HSMFast Focusing in most lighting conditionsSolid constructionCons:Low light slow to focus...while not a deal breaker you buy 2.8 for those momentsWould I buy this for a friend. Yes, while it is not Canon L glass, it is a great substitute when you take into account the cost."
4,Great Lens-good sharpness,"I have used this lens over a year and the only time I pull out the MUCH bulkier Canon 24-70L F2.8 is if I think I really need a little more reach than the 18-50 provides. The only downside is that its only for 1.6x multipler canon DSLR's, so think about what your future needs will be (such as full frame body purchase) because you can't use this lens then. Pictures have excellent sharpness and focusing is fast and fairly quiet. Pop Photo did a review of this lens in 2005 and received kudo's (it was $500 when I bought it). Although its much lighter than the 24-70L, it still feels well built. I use a filter adapter (no vignetting) to allow use of 77mm filters, which all of mine are."
1,weeds,"I have been using this product for years. I always had a favorable reaction, but this year it destroyed most of my flowers, weeds weeds and more weeds. I bought bags of this potting soil, I will never buy it again. I don't know what happened this year. My whole yard front, side and back have pots, some very large ones and every pot is just engulfed with weeds I have about 50 container plants, I know its this soil because I bought a small bag of another brand and those pots are fine."
1,Do not buy this product,"I bought this product with the hopes that it would help to clear my mild to moderate acne. At the time I started using the productI had very litte acne on my face. I used this prodcut for 4 weeks, I actually just stopped yesterday. It had ben making my face worse by the day; I was getting little white heads and red bumps all around my lip and chin area. The day time lotion is very greasy and leaves your skin shiny. I finally had to go back to proactiv. I do no recommend this product nor will I purchase any further clearasil products."
4,Look intelligent when speaking with financial types...,"The book is an easy read. Once you get past the author's editorial comments and feeble attempts at humor, the book provides a great overview of financial concepts and how they apply to business decisions. This book enabled me to put my engineering and marketing bias aside and develop a much better understanding of the financial impact of business decisions. However, I still doubt I will ever be friendly with the CFO. One of the author's comments confused me a bit. He suggests leaving the book in the pocket of an airplane seat for someone else to read when I'm done with the book. Wouldn't this be bad for the author financially?"
2,Explanation of why it's boring,"The first half is a lot more detailed and imaginative than the second, when it appears that the author got tired and started rushing through to the end we all know is coming. ""I got pregnant, then I lost the child"" is not the stuff of gripping psychological drama. Pick up Margaret George instead."
3,Worth a read!,"Jean Plaidy's depiction of Anne Boleyn and the court of Henry VIII was well-written and, at times, poignant. I realize that not everything is known about Anne Boleyn; some writers have taken extremely indulgent artistic liberties when writing about this fascinating woman, while Jean Plaidy's version is just nicely peppered. It was a refreshing outlook on the queen's life and times.I had no trouble staying engaged in the book, but it also didn't keep me glued to the page. I borrowed it from the library so I can't say it will stay on my shelf (rather than being dumped at the Goodwill.) I would consider reading it again."
1,Boring.,"How could anyone make Anne Boleyn boring? I wouldn't have thought it possible, but that was before I read this sorry excuse for a book. Poorly written. Terrible characterization. Even for a novel, research is sketchy. Overall, the thing reads like she picked up an Alison Weir, skimmed through it, end of research.I would give this book two stars for effort, but I find Anne Boleyn to be one of the most fascinating personalities of Tudor England, and this butchering of her story sweeps away any sympathy I might have had."
3,"It's all right, but...","Marion was definitely a great flutist and a solid musician. I object to him ""aping"" Rampal's mannerisms like the meaningless ritardandos in the Bach and the generally 19th century approach to playing Baroque music. I kind of feel sorry for flutists, being one myself, because they can't seem to get over the fact that most flute music is mediocre junk. Why bother recording Genin, Boehm and Doppler? I just don't get it. I would so much rather have them look to contemporary composers or write their own works than regurgitate this musical dross."
2,RUMPOLE OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION,"I cannot give a review of the entire book, as I have only read one of the short stories contained in it. I read the one entitled, ""Rumpole of the Younger Generation."" I felt like I was wasting my time, because all I was reading was a synopsis of a former triumph of this man. The case might have been exciting, but the author did not play fair, and the guilty party was obvious. I did not like this story very much, and can only hope that the rest of them are better than this one was."
4,nice style graphic,"nice looking when installed, still can see interior but not as easily.have it installed by a pro get it done proper."
5,Absolutely amazing,"I've been watching these series since I was a child, and the amazing story line coupled with the haunting melodies of Clannad really make watching them a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I highly recommand finding the complete set which ranges from the first four dvd's with Michael Pryed to the later ones with Jason Connery. Although you cannot find them in a playable US region coding, you can however find them in the European coding which will play a PAL DVD player...or XBox if you happen to own one.However you decide to do it, they are wonderful, and for those that loved Robin Hood they are not to be missed."
4,Andy Williams CD,"I bought this CD for one song, ""Something Stuipd"". This is the only CD that has that one song. If I were going to buy one Andy Williams CD it would be his 16 Most Requested Songs CD but this CD is a good one."
5,Need the rest!,I didn't realize this was the 4th book in the series until after I read it. I can't wait to read the others.
5,The most creepy and intense Seer yet,"Sabine finds herself haunted by the sinister ghost inside a witch ball, which looks much like a crystal ball and even deals out fortunes--including Sabine's own death. When the fortunes start coming true, Sabine knows she's in big trouble. Another great entry in this fast-paced and enjoyable series!"
3,Not much depth,"This book read like the outline of a story. There just wasn't enough to it which made the characters come off as mostly two-dimentional, very generic. There's enough story here to put some meat on its bones, too bad the author didn't do it. Even the book's formatting screams that there needs to be more. Some pages nearly had more white space than words. I don't think I'll be revisiting this series."
2,Worst book in the series,"I really liked the first two books of this series, and I was excited to read this one. However, once I got halfway through it, I was annoyed with Sabine's dependency on Josh. If she can't be honest with him, then she shouldn't be with him. I feel that the author has dragged out the Sabine, Josh, Dominic love triangle for too long, so I'm not even planning on finishing the series."
4,recommended,"Ok, so the best way to learn banjo is by ear, but I learned alot from this book. It was the first clawhammer book I ever picked up and I had no previous banjo experience. I think that this book along with listening to alot of recordings took me along way towards learning to play. I would certainly recommend it. My only criticism is that I wish that there were more tab variations offered for more tunes, but still, it is a great collection."
2,Not a beginner book,"I was disappointed in the CD as it doesn't contain many tunes - only five of them. If you don't know the tunes from other sources, you won't know how they sound and find this rather useless. Nice collection of tunes, but I have no idea how many of them are to be played."
3,For beginners only!,"This is a very readable text that essentially parallels and expands upon the LabView Users Manuals. If you have read through all or most of those manuals you may find yourself rapidly skimming through Bishop's book as nothing more than a refresher. Newbies will appreciate the simplistic step-by-step approach but anyone beyond the basics will likely be disappointed. BTW, you can download the related files from the LabView site to get an idea of the content."
3,Made in China,"Apart from the discrepancy (to follow), the bottle opener seems well built. It is solid, has a nice feel in the hand, and sports an elegant utilitarian look. It has no sharp edges, and I fully expect it to last and function well for a long time.As many other reviewers have noted, this bottle opener is **Made in China**, despite a description that clearly states made in Germany. Had I read the reviews and noticed this I would not have bought it. My grievance is not so much with Amazon for getting the listing wrong, as it is with Rösle for making it in China. Doubtless when this was first listed some years ago, it was indeed ""Made in Germany"". A $20 bottle opener can be made in Germany and still make a profit. A good company that loses the pride of manufacturing locally is, often as not, no longer a good company.Five stars for a good product.One star for having it manufactured in the wrong country.Average: three stars."
3,A 3-handed operation,"I bought this bottle opener as part of the Rosle system, including a towel dispenser, can opener, shelf, pizza cutter and cheese plane. Several of these items I reviewed separately. The bottle opener is elegant looking, with substantial heft for an opener. My sole criticism, and the reason I'm giving it only 3 stars, is that it takes 3 hands...one to hold the opener, one to hold the bottle, and one to prevent the bottle cap from bouncing off the countertop and onto the floor. Actually, I'm not sure that third hand would be very helpful due to the shape of the opener, which covers the cap and makes catching it a hit-or-miss proposition...more miss than hit."
2,Beware -- MADE IN CHINA,"I was excited to receive my Rosle Bottle Opener, which cost me nearly $20, but its ""German made"" so the extra cost is well worth it, right? -- when it arrived the joke was on me..... a ""Made in China"" sticker was on the handle. I let amazon know about the problem but they have not changed the product description (it still says made in Germany - LIES!). The product itself is not horrible, but certainly not worth $20. I should have purchased the OXO bottle opener for $10."
5,Werewolf of London,"My brother tried and tried to get this from book stores, including Barnes & Noble, no one could get it for him. I typed it in and Amazon found it right away and it got here in time for his birthday, and was in great shape."
5,Spirit of the Water Barbie - Native American,"I absolutely love the Spirit of the Water Barbie, her clothes are gorgeous from a matching feather in her hair to a neckalce/bracelet set. She is designed beautifully!"
4,Water Spirit,"While the Barbie Doll met expectations, I was disappointed with the lack of care in the packing from the seller. The box showed some damage upon arrival and I believe more care in packing might have prevented it. For a collector, the condition of the box is as important as the doll."
4,Left Handed peeler,"We ended up getting a right handed peeler instead of a left handed one. My husband liked it so well we did not send it back. It is sleek, sharp and lovely but am still not happy I have to peel towards myself as I didn't get what I ordered."
5,Just so we're clear...,"To reinforce the comments of others here: This is a ""Right-Handed"" peeler. This means if you want to hold the peeler in your right hand and the peelee in your left hand, you will have to peel TOWARD yourself (European style). If you want to hold a Rosle swivel peeler in your right hand and the peelee in your left hand and peel AWAY from yourself, you should buy theRösle Left-Handed Swivel Peeler. Really.As for the quality and aesthetics, it's top notch. Simply the best. See my (and others') review of theRösle Crosswise Swivel Peeler. The same sentiments apply."
5,Great peeler!!,"After being disappointed with ""chunky handle"" peelers, this was a pleasant surprise. I had high expectations for a $25 peeler and this one is definitely worth it. The handle feels balanced and natural, the blade is sharp and pivots nicely. I'm right handed and peel towards myself so this is perfect. No issues with the coring point as others have reported. Dishwasher safe and replaceable blades - what more do you need? While Rosle is still a German company, some of their production is now in China. I don't have an issue with that as long as the quality is there. This one had a ""Made in China"" sticker on the handle that was removed easily."
2,a minority opinion,"Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he ""wound his arm around her waist""). Less than halfway through this story, its central ""mystery"" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places.On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written."
2,Thought it would never end,"This book was a very long, boring, lamenting woman who goes on and on and on, over and over and over, about the life that could have been. Her daughter was just as bad as her only more immature. I liked the mom, but her story was sad to read through much of it. I usually like Debbie Macomber, but this one was pretty depressing until chapter 41, and there were only 44 chapters; it is hard to read 41 chapters of depressing. It took forever to finish it, and quite frankly I don't know why I was compelled to do so. I'll keep reading Debbie, but I don't recommend this book. Another thing, if you are looking for this book to be a part of Blossom street, don't! It is mentioned in the last chapter, but none of the characters from the previous books are re-visited in Savannah's Garden. In fact Savannah is only in Seattle briefly at the beginning of the book. The rest of the book is spent in the town of Colville."
4,Very satisfied,I received the book I ordered in a prompt manner. It was packaged very well. Very satisfied with my purchase.
3,Grab Your Spade!,"Seldom does so much of a story's plot develop in a graveyard. This is appropriate in Susannah's Garden, however, because in this fast-paced story, Susannah does a lot of digging to unearth truth and burying misperceptions to make peace with her past. Legacies, multigenerational family challenges, faithful friendships, razor-edged evils, secrets, and lies twist and turn toward a love-conquers-all ending. This is a thrilling, engaging novel. Any woman could easily identify with the emotions of one or more characters; I could even see several of the story's actual situations in my own life. I expected the story to have a stronger connection to the garden in the title, but that is seed-size criticism compared with the rich understanding of human emotions gained by reading Debbie Macomber's Susannah's Garden story."
3,She's definately got better books,"I love Debbie Macomber...quick, feel-good reads. Out of the books I've read that she's authored, though, have to say was a bit disappointed in this one. Seems that she was trying her hand at mystery writing, but it wasn't really believable. She certainly has better books out there."
4,Relaxing reading,"I enjoyed this book immensely. As a new Debbie Macomber fan, this was a wonderful introduction for me. I found it a very realistic book, as the condition of Susannah's aging Mom is similar to my own. I identified with lots of the story and loved the sweet way the book ends. I heartily recommend it."
1,Not her best effort,"I enjoy Debbie Macomber's Blossom Street stories. They provide a refreshing counterpoint to some of the other types of books I typically read. And I love their attractive cover illustrations. So when I picked up this book I looked forward to another pleasant read. But I have found myself by turns irritated at the simplistic characters, annoyed by the silly dialog, and disgusted with the trivial storyline. A fifty-year-old woman who is still hung up on her high school sweetheart is a ridiculous figure. The tortured passion of Carolyn and Dave is so Romance Novel-ish that it is laughable. And the bratty daughter is a selfish little twit.I'm sorry I spent money on this paperback. Ms. Macomber did not even half-try to write a decent book. She owes more to her fans."
2,Okay but predictable,"Not a terrible book, but the ending is pretty predictable, though they try to make it seem like some big shock. And the more the book went on, the less I liked Susannah - she purposely puts her marriage at risk for some dumb boy she dated in high school? Then she keeps a bunch of secrets from her husband, handles her daughter Chrissie's issues badly, then suddenly everything is wrapped up, and Susannah gets what she wants-- then randomly decides to open a flower shop to segway into the next book. I do feel that the author did a good job portraying the elderly mom Vivian. But I definitely don't plan to read any more of this series."
3,Not what I expected!,"I ordered this book as I thought it was a mystery. It is a mystery as such, but not the type of enjoy. I would suggest it not be listed as a mystery but as a romance. It is well written, but just not of interest to me."
5,Susannah's Garden (Blossom Street),"I like the series of Blossom Street books, they are enjoyable but they also can teach all of us different things concerning our life's as the characters learn things in their own life's."
5,Easy Read...very Realistic,"I deal with the aging population, an aging mother, and love gardening which is why I was immedialtly drawn to this book. Very realistic and heartwarming. Susannah finds herself ""sandwiched"" in between her aging mother and her young inexpirenced daughter who knows it all. She tried to deal with the emotions alone of moving her mother into assisted living, feelings she had with her father who dies before she had dealt with unresolved issues from her own childhood, and her daughter also who is dealing with some similar issues. Susannah re-developes friendships from her childhood, discovers ""lost"" love and respect for her parents. I felt the ending was done very quickly and could have been finished with a little more information as she had given throughout the book."
2,What a disappointment!,"I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden."
4,book gift rated,Bought as a gift and the recipient really liked the bookand wanted the large print version for reading ease
2,Couldn't finish either,"The writing in this book was almost forced, like something was just put down to get the story out. I admit I couldn't get very far along, but there just wasn't a flow of the words and this made it difficult to stay with the story. The characters and their circmstances were cliches and I felt like I knew what would be said next (as you do with a bad sitcom). Perhaps it improved as it progressed but I just wasn't interested enough to find out."
5,Debbie Macomber fan,This was a fabulous story about family dynamics. The story kept moving and had quite a surprise ending. Well worth reading. I would read it again!
3,Innocuous airplane fare,"Susannah's Garden was a pleasant way to spend a few hours on the plane. Although it's lightweight reading and the very mild mystery had an obvious solution, I could relate to the main character. Having dealt with a mother afflicted with senile dementia, I found the tug of war between Susannah and her mother very realistic. The only thing I questioned was the likelihood of a woman who often didn't recognize family members having the capacity to develop a love interest with an octogenarian boyfriend (I kept imagining, ""Who are you?"" ""I'm George, your boyfriend."" ""Who?""). The immaturity of Chrissie and Susannah's frustration with her were also captured nicely. The long-suffering Joe seemed a little too good to be true, but hey, don't we all wish for a husband like him. Nice, feel-good tale."
3,The Sandwich Generation,"Susannah struggles with her relationships with her mother, Vivian and daughter, Chrissie, while trying to deal with her doubts about her marriage, and unresolved issues with her deceased father and brother. This is a true slice of life, and we agonize with Susannah over her mother's frailty, and Chrissie's determined and perhaps self-destructive rebelliousness. Mastering her past and her relationships, supported by friend Carolyn and husband Joe, Susannah grows into her stage of life, blooming with new plans and contentment."
2,Disappointing.....,"I have been an avid fan of Debbie Macomber since she wrote her first book. I am sorry to say I did not get into this one. The characters were not very believable and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The ending was wrapped up a little too quickly and ""they lived happily ever after""...sorry..I wish I would have just checked this out of the library."
1,Not good,I was not able to finish this book. I am raising kids & I feel this is better suited to my Mom.
5,The Macomber books,These books are always written as though I could go out my front door and meet these people. The places are familar and the interaction of the characters are great.
1,Bad construction,"This knife is supposed to be a springless locking type knife. In 3 months after purchasing the first one from the same source, the blade would not stay in and last week would no longer lock when fully open. I have no reason to believe that this 2nd one will be any different."
1,Awful,This author has a very poor understanding of virology. Frequent errors in the science and terminology made this book unbelievable and unreadable.
3,A sweet comedy of manners,"This comedy of manners chronicles a month (though it feels like much, much longer) in the lives of the London family, whose three brothers are all currently living near or visiting their parents' home in Beulah Hill (a neighborhood of London). At times the plotting is amateurish and the language stilted, but Jewell creates a complicated and interesting enough tangle of relationships between the brothers and their current and former girlfriends and wives that the story is worth following and its resolution worth caring about. The title character refers to a mysterious tattooed drifter named Gervase who befriends the family and then appears to solve the brothers' problems by placing his hands on their shoulders and (perhaps) psychically sensing their worries and giving them vague advice; I wouldn't have minded if this cheesy subplot had been omitted."
2,not as good as ralph's party,"I was not nearly as impressed by this book as I was Ralph's Party. This is basically the story of three spoiled, grown brothers who come back together to celebrate the 40th wedding anniversary of their parents. Their parents seem to have taken in a boarder, Gervase, who is a bizarre, tattooed, rockabilly-type who doesn't appeal to any of them.As the story goes on, you follow the lives of each of the sons through their selfish thoughts and reasoning. Gervase seems to be the only one who can help each of them come into their own and figure out what to do next. The whole story is entertaining, but just a little too cheesy for me."
2,A Friend of the family,"The book was interesting enough, and I even liked the characters, but it seemed more like a play on morals, than an actual story. And I didn't really like the friend of the family, his position in the book seemed forced, and it was quite unnecessary if you ask me. I think the story had alot of potential, but it just ended up being very simplistic, and straight forward. And the writing seemed rather uninspired and failed to engage the reader."
4,Nice side treat for your small pet birds,A good addition as a treat but not to be used as a main diet. Birds seem to enjoy the mix and were quick to empty the treat cup.
5,A gem,"A cynic may try to discount this classic as nostalgic kitsch, but I am not one. The characters in this little gem come to life in much the same way the heroes of (yes!) Bergman or Charlie Chaplin do: once seen they're difficult to forget.The accident-prone doctor, Otik (of course), the city slickers and crass bureaucrats, it's all here. Not to mention copious amounts of beer, poetry and kielbasa.I only have one obvious question: Region 1 DVD???!!!"
5,Fun for all ages!,My dad recently got this game. He likes the games with all the shooting and stuff like Halo and the other Army games. This game is really fun. I like this game more than the other gun games my dad plays.I like the vehicles. I won't be able to drive a car for a few more years and it was fun to drive around in tanks and car with guns.I think other people would like this game as well.
5,Best FPS bar none. I love this game and you will too.,"I think this one blows Halo away for many reasons. There are so many weapons you can have and vehicles to drive. The emersion is fantastic. If you are a fan of FPS, you MUST get this one. It is only 19 bucks and is not a short game by any means. This one will stay in my library for years to come."
1,blind disgrace by Dark Dr,project snow blind is a great dissapointment its only value in the game its self is xbox live quality theres no co op gameplay is a bit repetitive and pointless stay away from this game better options are timespliters and psi ops the mind gate conspiracy
5,"A haunting, true story - a must read for mothers","June Golding's account of her two years as a midwife at a convent run as a home for unwed mothers in Ireland in the early fifties is a haunting reminder about human rights and basic human decency. These young mothers were effectively convicted and incarcerated for the untenable crime of conceiving a child out of wedlock. There children were taken, ostensibly to provide ""better"" lives for them, but often without the consent of their mothers. Golding did what she could and ultimately, all she could do was tell their stories. I am a birth mother, but the circumstances around my son's adoption was so far from what these women endured. I had a strong support network around me that included the parents I chose for my son and I knew that I was doing what was best for him and for me. These women in these homes had no such luck. My heart breaks for them but I am so grateful to Golding for bringing their stories to light."
4,Horrific story but one that needs to be told.,I know one of the babies born in this awful place who was adopted out to the US and that's how I heard about this book. It's a very cruel and unforgiving story but amazingly my friends mother has been able to forgive.
4,Handy toddler chair,"My son had this chair for my 15 month grandson ( after buying an expensive highchair ); and we all loved it so much that I also purchased one for my house. It is easy to attach and clean. Incidentally , we longer use the ""expensive"" highchair."
1,Nightmare Chair,"I would not recommend this chair to anyone. My 11 month old has figured out she can get out of the straps by standing up - even with the straps as tight as they can go! I'm terrified she's going to climb out and fall to the floor if I turn away for a second. In addition it gets dirty very quickly (1 meal) and is a pain in the neck to disassemble and wash in the washing machine. Sure, you can wipe it down with a wet cloth, but that doesn't really do enough. I don't have a 4 inch gap between the table and the seat as others have posted, but I do have about an inch. Even this amount is enough to keep mealtime a disaster.I'm going to buy something else! Not worth the risk or filth!"
3,hook on chair,"The chair itself works great. My only complaint there is that sometimes I cant get the adjustable knob underneath to unlatch, so that gets frustrating. The other thing I don't like about it is the canvas-y material that the seat is made of is hard to wipe clean. Food gets all smashed into the little graininess of the fabric and you wipe and wipe and it looks like you got it clean, but when it dries later you can still see stuff crusted into the fabric. Luckily, once through the washer gets it really clean, but for day-to-day cleaning its kind of a pain."
2,Didn't fit our table,"This chair didn't fit our table. It fit under the table skirt, but the bottom brackets extended too far and it the leaf mechanism of our table. We returned it (very easy and free to do!) and gotGraco Travel Lite Table Chair Tango in the Tongoinstead. The chicco one looks a little more sophisticated too, but the Graco one was the best for us."
2,fit well on table but poor quality!,"This chair fits a table with a large lip(mine is about 3 1/2inches) I was pleases with that but watch out if you have a table with a leaf to make it bigger, that gets in the way of the arms of the chair. I was only able to get it to fit on one area of my table and it wasnt where i wanted it. I was willing to deal with it beacause it worked just fine untill about a month into having it the seems started to rip apart. IDK if i just ended up with a lemon but I was a little anoid! I returned it!!!"
3,Chicco Chair,"I was not as impressed with this hook on chair. The chair works fine, but the straps DO NOT keep my 20 month old in the seat at all no matter how tight I fix the straps. It is really frustrating since I don't want him crawling out onto the table. I think for younger children 9 months to 12 months it would probably work well. It is sturdy and strong, just not what I was looking for."
4,Buy a bib with this purchase,"The seat works great, is easy to use and easy to clean - but it took me a bit to figure out how to keep the mess from landing in my toddler's lap on its way to his mouth. The solution? Buy a toddler place mat with this hook-on chair."
4,My baby's dream come true,"Our baby girl is 1 year old, my wife and I love to go out to eat specially on week ends. Often we have surprised our selves when many restaurants don't have enough high chairs, and when they do, either the seat belt is missing or defective, or they are so filthy we have to personally clean them up. Also when we visit our parents or other relatives and friends, hey don't have high chairs period!.The best way to ensure our baby girl is not running away or having one of us taking car of here ""of the table"", is with this fantastic high chair. Our baby is on the table at our hand and in a secure and clean place. An extra is that the system itself holds the table clothe in place so it will not be pulled of by here.IT DOES STAY IN PLACE AND IT IS ROBUST ENOUGH TO HOLD HERE WHEN SHE'S TRYING TO FREE HERSELF."
4,"It's perfect, but...","Our daughter loved being able to sit directly at the table, instead of on the side in her high chair. It's easy to clean, we'd just take it off the frame and put it in the washing machine. It is very sturdy, and fit fine on all 4 tables we've used it on, even ones with a large lip. I think maybe others didn't read the instructions on how to adjust the clamps.Our only problem with this chair is that the safety belt is not sufficient in holding our 14 mo. down when she tries to stand up. Maybe she has a funny shape to her, because no matter how tight the belt is, she always manages to stand up and slip out. So basically we can only use this if we are sitting within reach of her. I wonder if the company can re-adjust the strap placement, because we are certainly not the only ones with a little houdini!"
3,Returned,Returned & purchased Inglesina brand. Very sturdy & easy to attach to table but too difficult to fold; couldn't do it by myself
3,convenient but questionable safety,Although overall convenience is great. We enjoy having our son at the kitchen counter pass-thru. However here are the...CONS - material needs to be slick so you can wipe it down. we need to throw it into the washer to get it clean.-safety belt does not keep your children in the seat. it only gives you a small amount of seconds before you notice that he's about to plunge to the floor. we cannot turn our back on him because he is quick. like houdini.- support arms are crooked under the table!!!! this freaks me out. I am positive that i have this thing installed correctly but the arms are at angle and that freaks me out. i have put an email in to the company with an attached photo to show my problem but still no response to the safety of this product.
1,defective and dangerous,"The first time we used this chair the stitching started coming undone from around the back of the seat; this seam in essence holds the weight of the child. If I had not noticed this defect, our baby might have easily fallen out. Shoddy manufacturing. Product to be avoided at all costs."
5,Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair,This is a great chair! We take it everywhere we go. It will hook on to most tables but at least our daughter does not have to sit in the restaurant high chairs (gross!) It is very handy. It could use some type of clip to keep the legs together when it is folded up.
