4,Great Companion Piece to the Series,"While I somewhat enjoyed the task of deciphering and tracking down the myriad of specialized, arcane and obsolete words employed by Patrick O'Brian in his majestic Aubrey-Maturin series, the discovery of this book provided a much more concise and handy way of doing this.O'Brian's vast vocabulary and vast knowledge of seagoing nomenclature as well as late 18th and early 19th century social mores is impressive. This book allows one to appreciate the level of scholarship applied by O'Brian. However, this is much more than a simple glossary. It includes short biographies of leading personages of the day, histories of important battles, diagrams of ships and rigging and geographical references.While one can probably get along without this book; assuming one has access to a good dictionary, encyclopedia and other reference books, this tome certainly eases the task."
3,A Huge O'Brian Fan can do without it,"It's fun to look at for a little while, but I haven't checked it in ages."
5,Sea of Words,This is a book for everyone who reads fictional history that involves the navy of the turn of the century between the late 1700 hundreds and into the first half of the 1800 hundreds. When one reads these books there are terms that need to defined to better understand the meanings of words used. It is a most complete dictionary for this time period. It is just a must have for any bookcase and fictional navel history buff.
4,"Sea Of Words, second edition",The Aubrey/Maturin novels are the greatest sea stories but sometimes hard to understand some of the language.This book is a great help and keeps you in the flow of the book.This is a great companion if you love Aubrey/Maturin.
4,"Not exactly required, but definately fun to read","If you're the kind of person who finds joy in reading about language and colloquialisms of the past, this is a great book. It also contains a fair amount of background on many of the historical (real) characters from the Aubrey/Maturin books, as well as many geographic locations visited from the novels. A brief chronology of the wars during the age of sail (Napoleonic, War of 1812, etc) is quite useful. I'm also fairly impressed with its completeness with the obviously strange ones - ""Drowned Baby"", for instance. (It's a dessert.) You don't need it to understand the language of O'Brian's books, but you'll probably have more fun if you bring ""A Sea of Words"" along for the ride."
1,Get the THIRD or FIRST edition,"This is an excellent reference guide. However, the 2nd edition of this book has a major printing error. Most of the terms beginning with ""C"" and the beginning of the ""D"" entries are missing, and there's a reprinted set of pages from later in the book inserted instead.Avoid the 2nd edition!"
3,Sparks,"When I got it I was excited that I was finally able to use my laptop again. However right away I noticed a few things. First I noticed that it was smaller than the one I had, it takes longer to charge, and whenever I plug it in it sparks. It has been a few weeks since I have bought it, and it still sparks yet I am happy that it does the job."
1,Not real stuff,It only lasted a few months. It DIDN'T charge the battery either. It's not the REAL stuff. Very disappointed! This one is not cheap anyway. I'll suggest you to throw in just a few more bucks to get one from Dell.
4,Great product from a great seller,"I've received this great product from a trusted seller. I performed perfectly. However, I had been using it for less than 3 months because my laptop was infected with a computer virus beyond repairation and I have replaced it with a new Sony Vaio Laptop. I still have it, just in case I will have a Dell Laptop again."
5,Great Buy,"Dell branded product, 95 watts, saved me $50 buying it from Dell. I anticipate it will last longer then the one I had before, this seems to be of sturdier build. However this will probably suffer from the same defect most of them seem to, where the connecting cord to the laptop breaks its inner pin."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BUYER,"Claims to be a Dell Product. It is absolutely not. It's some Chinese knock-off. When I connected it to my laptop I got an error stating it was not a PA-10 adapter. It then would only run the computer at 10% of it's capacity, making it all but useless. I had to buy another adapter because this one was junk. Totally ripped off by these people."
1,smart_parts_usa charger is NOT genuine Dell & not UL approved,"Very disappointing. I ordered two of these so-called 'genuine' chargers made by Dell from ""smart_parts_usa"", and they sent cheap Chinese knockoffs.I tested one, and it sparked when I plugged it in. They are not UL approved, are bigger than a real Dell charger, and do not have the very handy cord wrapping device that comes from a Dell. No way am I going to risk my life in order to save a few bucks. No UL approval makes this a very risky product, IMHO..I am going to return them. Since they didn't send what I was sold, I hope not to have to pay return freight"
3,Not genuine dell accesory,"I didn't receive a genuine dell charger. It's cheap, works fine, but it's not a genuine dell charger like they show in the information and pictures. The power cord was broken just like a week of use, I had to buy another one. Not a quality product."
2,A Clearing in the Wild,Found the book boring and it often made me angry. It's fiction but based on true story. Hard to believe women put up with such nonsence.
4,Good tale ... but needs proofread!,"The story is excellent and you really like the characters (most of them, that is!). The other reviews cover the plot well. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because the Kindle edition was obviously scanned with an OCR and no one previewed it for errors. It seemed like every page had some typos. Things like ""you'll"" were written as ""you 11"" with ones instead of ""L""s and ""slaves"" would be ""slakes"" and even ""Keil"" sometimes was presented a ""Veil"". Of course, ""Vile"" would have been an excellent name for him! By all means, enjoy the story but use your imagination for some of the words."
5,A Clearing in the Wild,"This is the first of a series of three historical novels. I found it fascinating to learn about this German colony of people that moved from the Midwest to Washington state where they encountered many hardships. The main character, Emma, had an independent spirit and ""spunk"" to survive in this new and rugged country. This is interesting reading and I could hardly wait to read the next books in the series which took place in familiar areas of Washington and Oregon where I have lived for a number of years. Some of the historic sites can be visited today, bringing the stories alive."
4,Lynde Started Here...He Ain't Finished Yet!,"Lynde began his career as a western novelist with this book. His expertise takes him successfully through eight other books which includes his last (so far!), ""The Big Open."" Everyone should be read in order of their being written so you can enjoy Merlin from the git-go!"
2,Good Pictures; Very Little Said,"I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness. All in all, not a big price to pay for some really great pictures, but not much of anything else."
4,"Ehhhh....well, it's about time","Okay...I love AJ to death and I'm glad that she wrote this book to inform other AJ fans out there of how the real AJ is. I mean, a real AJ fan could be nothing but grateful for such a inciteful depiction of the man himself. I love the fact that she gathered old pictures and letters....but what I didn't like was the fact that of the letters that she wanted to keep private...she really shouldn't have published them and then covered them up.. I was overall happy with the book.PS and what in the world does ""Dino"" mean?"
1,If You Buy This...,"I can't believe she actually published personal, private poems A.J. wrote to her, and photos of A.J. and the rest of the Boys. The first thing that caught my eye was a notice, stating that A.J. McLean or any of the other Backstreet Boys had nothing to do with this book and did not agree to it. (Unauthorized, in other words.) If you really do love the Backstreet Boys, especially A.J., don't buy this book!"
5,Marisa and AJ are still friends!!!,"I am a very good friend of Marisa, and for all of you that are bashing her for writing this book let it be known...She wrote the book with his consent, the book was not suppose to be a tell all, it was for the fans to see what a great guy AJ is. I recently went to a show with Marisa to see him, and I know first hand that they are still good friends. She wrote the book for the fans, she doesn't deserve to be bashed by people who don't even know her. If in fact she wanted to do a tell all, TRUST ME SHE COULD OF!!!"
2,Not as upbeat and interesting as the samples suggest,"Based on the listening samples, I expected this CD to be more upbeat, and have more organic and international sounds. It's okay background music, but nothing really grabs your attention as genuinely interesting or unique."
3,Si Se,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this disc - it was one recommended by Amazon that I decided to take a chance on after sampling the clips and reading the reviews. It's not the kind of music that I have a lot of in my collection so it took a few listens for me to really appreciate it. It's good music to put on while I'm writing or working on projects at work - it's not overpowering music with heavy beats, etc but some tracks have the power to really uplift my mood and re-energize me.My favorite tracks are: THE RAIN - Carol C's voice is hauntingly beautiful and I love the beat of the music in this song; MY SOL -gorgeous instrumental; DOLEMITE - catchy, fun track, makes me want to get up dance everytime I hear it & CUANDO.I'd absolutely recommend this disc to my friends who like electronica/house/mixed beats because this group mixed genres of music to create their own sound."
3,So-so machine,"This unit is very small taking up a minimal amount of counter space. It has a large water reservoir preventing you from having to fill it on a daily basis. Unfortunately, I have the same complaint as most others that the water does not reach the manufacturers specified temperature. I am not sure that I would purchase this product again."
3,worked well the stopped a bit.,this machine worked great for @ 7 months. The it started shooting steam out through the area where the coffee was meant to be espressed out--so the steamer lost pressure. i feel the market for espresso machines of this kind/low price is indicative of what you will get--good performance for a time and then a fade away.
2,Poor performance with problems!,The first few cups were good then there were issues with the seal for the cup and I started to get leaks. Now after about 1 month of use the steam is blowing out through the cup holder area and makes a complete mess. I have seen this issue in other posts and now mine has done the same. Also the steamer valve is too close to the counter and makes it hard to get a cup or small pitcher underneath for frothing. I am having to return this item after only owning it for 1 month so be aware of the issues if you are planning on purchasing this one.
2,Not as good as the department store models,"When my $50 cheap-but-effective espresso machine conked out, I decided to upgrade to a pump-driven model. My mistake.The Lido model I purchased produces lukewarm, weak espresso, even using the recommended burr grinder at the finest grind setting. It may be that my machine is simply defective - either way, it's going back this week."
1,BIG Flop,I might have got a defective unit but of all the statements Briel makes only the one with the foam is real - you get foam ok. I used to operate a Gaggia in Europe and it was a piece of cake - it was just a bulky machine and what attracted me at the Briel was the size- the expresso is waeker than the one I prepare with my old 2 bar Krups using the same coffee.- coffee spills from the filter holder and makes a mess no matter if you use pods or not - especially with two cups- finally customer support is hard to reach when one is at home with the expresso machine (week-ends and early Eastern they are closed)Good luck to you
2,Red Light District,"A tremendous disappointment, and an obvious first attempt at moving the game to the XBox, NHL 2002 is best left in the oven, perhaps the 2003 version will come out thoroughly cooked. The game looks less realistic than the 1998 and 1999 versions on the old Playstation 1, and the announcers, formerly witty, are overbearing and just plain snarky in this version. EA made tremendous improvements to the Madden series on their 2nd try for XBox, here's hoping they do the same here."
3,Average Game,"This game has some good points such as its graphics and the controls are well laid out, but after only playing ONE game I was able to score 17 goals! I haven't scored that many goals since I played NHLPA '94 on my old Sega Genesis... 7 years ago. I guess that what I am getting at is that the game isn't very realistic when someone (playing only their second game, mind you) can rip off 17 goals during the shortest period setting. Thankfully I rented it and didn't buy it; I think that I'm going to check out HITZ... you probably should too. Then again, if you're into having 30+ goal games with your buds... this game might be right up your alley."
3,it is O.K.,"NHL 2002 is a great game when you first buy it. Its is fast paced, action packed, and just plain fun. but after a while you start losing interest. maybe its because the season is to long, or that you play it 24/7. then it just becomes one of your old games that you dont play to much. if the could have like cheats for extra special teams and stuff it might be more fun, but unfortuatley NHL 2002 doesnt have that. i think this is just a waste of money considering how boring it gets...."
3,Not the best hockey game,I was very displeased with the play of this game. I expected a lot more from a company like EA. I would try NHL Hitz instead if you were looking to purchase a hockey game...
2,a novella which wears it's OS on its sleeve,"PDU-1 is perhaps the first work of fiction written especially for the community of UNIX programmers, and hopefully they will enjoy it. Otherwise the plot is rather predictable and its pseudo-feminist doctrine derivative of _The Left Hand of Darkness_ and other SF of the seventies, with a little anti-government paranoia of the '90s mixed in. The prose is kind of klunky; [...] and the ""dialogue"" entirely didactic exposition. But then (alas), science fiction is rarely meant to be great literature.Or maybe I just don't ""get it;"" I'm a Macintosh guy."
3,Better than traditional trays yet worse,"I've had this tray for a year. It has held up nicely and shows no wear at all.Its very easy to pop the ice cubes out because the tray is super flexible. But, the same flexbility which makes it so easy to get cubes out allows the tray to flop around and spill water. It must sit on a level surface in the freezer or water will spill. It also takes extra care to get a tray of water from the sink to the freezer.It takes many dolphins to equal one ordinary cube, but the dolphins are much more fun."
3,fun for kids but sorta small,"i bought this item because i thought it'd be fun to have shaped ice cubes for the kids. and it is. but the cubes are SMALL so you'll end up using most or all of them for one largish glass of liquid. Also, they're not easy to refill because the silicone is sort of floppy."
4,Good product.,"I love these silicone ice trays, they are way easier than regular ones you have to bang out of the tray.All you do it press on it and they pop out and don't fly every where.The only problem with this dolphin one is that the first few times you use it the tail gets stuck, but after several uses it gets easier. They are smallish ice cubes so get more than one tray. I have a penguin one that is awesome."
5,Wonderful,I have read many memoirs but find this to be especially powerful. The only complaint is we do not learn more about his journey after the Holocaust.
5,***** Strongly Urged to Read *****,"I must tell you that I do not enjoy reading. However after hearing an audio interview with Mr. David Faber, on a local Christian radio station, I had to buy his book. I could not put it down. It was the first thing I picked up after work and the last thing I would lay down at night. Totally pulls at your heart strings. I found myself holding my breath as I would read Mr Faber's detailed accounts of what he went through. Although there are graphic accounts of his torture, it allows the reader to truly feel and vividly picture what he went through. From leaving their house, on the run, hiding, to the Gheto, the capture, the survival - It was just an amazing book. I am reading it again now for the 4th time - and remember I am the one that doesn't like to read much.I have shared my copy with many, and all are truly touched. I really encourage you to buy this book if you are looking for a Holocaust Survivor book."
5,Amazing,"A few months ago I had a real urge to learn more about the holocaust. Throughout school I had a real phobia of the subject, I didn't like hearing about it and even worse, seeing the pictures and footage of it all. I decided to face my fears head on and instead of reading what everyone first recommended. (the diary of a young girl) I went with something I could relate to. I as a guy wanted to read about someone else of the same gender who lived to tell the tale. I wanted something with detail and something hard hitting that would really make me appreciate life alot more. I can't even describe how much this book has changed my views on alot of things. It would be amazing to meet Faber and speak with him about everything he went through. What a courageous boy he was to endure all of this."
4,Thank God there was a Romek,"This is a harrowing story that will take your breath away. How David survived was a miracle and God did want him to live. I really enjoyed the writing of the story even though reading it had me in tears many times. The only reason I do not give this 5 stars was because it ended so abruptly. I wanted to know what happened to David, did he marry have children. So many questions left un-answered. I have read many survivor stories but David's was one that I will remember forever. Thank You for telling the story and I am so thankful for your brother Romek and for you."
1,blew out three of them,"Be careful: Mine only lasted a few months. Had great hopes, but looks like poor manufacture.They fail at the bends and at the base. I called Camco, and said their lifetime warranty is only good at the store. The store says after 30 days its up to Camco.Good system."
3,Fascinating View of Immigration,"As a Canadian of Ugandan descent, I myself think this hemisphere profits from detailed disclosures of the sad history of immigration. Exactly such a writer we have in Odimumba Kwamdela, who spares no detail in conveying the process of uprooting oneself, in an uplifting way. Yet despite his genteel and at times dark prose, his ""trip up the river"" back in time ""to when the big trees were kings"" becomes marred by stylistic difficulties. In short, Kwamdela could be accused of pretentiousness. Anyhow, all that seems overblown when you consider how this fine author retells a family story that at times makes you wonder why did you emigrate in the first place. Every reader will be amused by the tale of ""the black man drinking Moosehead Bear."""
3,Letters on keys wears off after a few years,"I've had this keyboard for two years now and the only thing I can really complain about is the letters wear off some of the keys, and the company that makes this doesn't seem to offer any way to contact them.Otherwise, it works fine."
5,Authentic - Real Rock and Roll!!,"These guys make more famous bands that play retro/roots rock (Stray Cats/Blasters/Los Lobos etc) sound like choir boys. The material is outstanding, rocks hard all the way through. Live is what this band is best at. After tracks 1 thru 12 you'll think it can't possibly get better - but it does. They tear into Link Wray's immortal masterpieces, ""Ace of Spades"" and ""Rawhide"" back to back and they nail it. I'm sure Link would agree. For best results crank the volumn way up!"
3,A beautiful story but no character development.,I enjoyed this story. The love story between Mary and Joseph was was beautifully depicted and I love the way they were presented as human beings and not perfect. My only two problems with this book were tha it was too short and there was no character development. Mary and Joseph were chosen for the faith they displayed. Mary was discontented throughout most of the book and Joseph never beleived Mary at all. That was a little dissapointing but I think the author was just trying to depict the very human doubts and fears they must have had. Just don't read the story expecting some great revelation on the part of the characters
5,Another good Berg...,"This is the last Berg book I read, and I was not looking forward to it, but warmed to the idea of her own version of what happened between Mary and Joseph. It's very unique, and I really liked it. It's short, but I read it in one sitting. It's heart warming and touching, and is thought provoking. I like that she did this, and it's so different from anything else she's written."
5,A lovely holiday tale!,"This book really got me into the holiday spirit. It's a beautifully told tale of Mary and Joseph, and once you start reading it's hard to put down. Although it is a serious subject, it is told as a beautiful love story and anyone can relate to Mary and Joseph and the trials they endure.I think this would be a wonderful movie some day!It is one of my favorite Elizabeth Berg novels, and I hope to read it every year with our family to get into the holiday spirit! I think this book would make a great holiday gift."
3,A New Perspective,"An innovative and creative look at the birth of the Savior by focusing on the relationship between Mary and Joseph. I really appreciated thinking about the birth of Jesus from the perspective of a young couple who were floored with the news that they would be the earthly parents of the Savior. While this is no ""The Red Tent,"" it still made me think about this precious story in a whole new way, and it brought me to tears several times."
1,What happened to Elizabeth Berg???,"She used to be one of my favorite writers, but what has happened to her? She hasn't written a book that I enjoyed in years. I loved her earlier works because they were contemporary real stories with characters you could get lost in. I felt so satisfied after reading those books.This book is awful. Plain awful."
1,hand maid and the carpenter,awful. I was soooo disappointed in berg. I have always loved her writing. The last two books she has done have been terrible. What happened????
1,unexpected,"I was very drawn to read about the relationship between Mary and Joseph, and see them in a more down to earth manner. However, it is my impression that the author describes the characters as shallow teenagers, with concerns belonging more to an American 21st century, than actual Nazareth in the year 4BC. She fails to inlcude in her story the dedication to prayer these two people probably shared, after all they were the chosen ones to raise God's only Son. The connection with God is hardly mentioned. Mary and Joseph spend a lot of time praying, in direct contact with God, Even at the birth, they were in the presence of the Lord, can you imagine the extasis of one 's soul in such presence! Mary and Joseph were spiritually evolved compared to the rest of humanity, not only they come off as merely man and woman in this story, but really shallow and silly at it.Needles to say I was very dissapointed...Sorry!"
2,had potential,"I saw this book at the library and thought ""hmmmm...interesting!"" I was disappointed. I thought it had a lot of promise. I still think it could have been a great book but it definitely wasn't. It felt like Berg didn't really want to offend anyone by focusing very much on the actual divine aspects of the relationship but instead portrayed them simply as a couple of historical figures. I guess my feelings on this book are summed up best this way: this book did not need to be written."
4,Christmas Love Story,This is a good retelling of the nativity Christmas story. The characters were likeable and seemed very real and easy to imagine.
2,A disappointing book from a terrific author,The best thing about this book was that is short. What a disappointment. So much conjecture and unrealistic conversation. I usually like this author's storytelling abilities and writing style but they both missed the mark in this book.
1,Truly horrible.,"This Peterson's guide is next to useless, UNLESS you already know where you want to go! For instance, suppose you'd like to pursue a Ph.D. in business administration or a B.S. in speech therapy, but you don't know which schools might offer those. Prepare yourself for reading every single review, trying to find those degrees, because there is no comprehensive index or cross-reference. None.For a book that lists so many schools (and there are a lot) and which must have taken a considerable amount of work to compile, this oversight is incomprehensible and crippling to someone trying to find a specific degree. Save your money and invest in something else, for this book will be no help whatsoever to you (unless, like I said, you already know the school you want to go to, in which case why would you need this book?)"
3,There are better books,"First, this is not a book for a complete novice. It does not teach the rules. It is for a beginner looing to improve.This was once a fair book amongst those available (certainly better than most of Reinfeld's rushed pot-boilers). But not anymore. It's very wordy, maybe too wordy. On the plus side, refutations of bad moves are often mentioned. But that doesn't make up for the plain-jane presentation.For a similar book, try any of the following:Purdy: Guide to Good ChessSeirawan: Play Winning ChessCapablanca: Chess FundamentalsIdiot's Guide to ChessChess for DummiesIf you like Horowitz (and note that most of his old books are in Descriptive Notation) then look for this used. But if you like that sort of book, then Euwe's Chess Master v. Chess Amateur is a much better choice."
2,Problem with clarity of the sound,"I was fascinated by the movie Farinelli when I first watched it on TV. The songs were so beautiful, and I never felt such a feeling like it. I decided to buy the OST CD because I knew that there definitely would be some problem with clarity, or bitrate if I buy mp3 files. However, I found out that this CD has the same problem. During the high-pitch part, the sound makes cracking sound and it is really annoying. I don't know whether it is the limit of sound technology or just a small problem with my CD, but that cracking sound made me very disappointed."
4,An Interesting Performance,"This performance electronically blends the voices of a soprano and a counter tenor in an attempt to create a voice that might be like that of the famous castrato Farinelli, reputedly to have had a voice of great power and range. Technically it is successful, you certainly would not know it was a composite voice unless you were told. And musically, too, it is quite satisfying. But I must question if it were realy necessary, listen to Mezzo Soprano Vivica Genaux's CD, Arias for Farinelli, her performance is dazzling, with far more expression and fire than you get with the composite, a far more satisfying performance. Please try to hear it."
3,It's OK,Just a quick review - I think I expected more from the choices of music from this film and it comes off as uninspiring. It will collect dust in my collection
4,SHiloh Sentinels,This picture book was a nice companion to the Gettysburg volume. The photos are great and an inspiration to me as I travel to that battlefield. I would have prefered more views of Ruggles' artillery battery but overall the photos are very good.
3,Another from Manga,"Anther great movie from the series!!! Violent, keep away from children. If you like anime, this is recommended"
3,Its okay,"This is a keyboard. ... this is NOT a Sony keyboard. It is made by Interact Accessories. It works like a keyboard(no surprise there). The fact that this is a USB device and is compatible with a PC leads me to believe that any cheap USB keyboard from Circuit City or CompUSA would work also. It is a keyboard and works like a keyboard. If you really want a keyboard, buy it. You probably won't use this very often so I don't see why you'd want it."
3,great service,"i recieved my keyboard in a resident evil box, which at first tripped me out, but then the actual box was inside it and everything was brand new looking... so i'm happy...no problems with my order at all, Thank you!"
3,"After a 3 month wait to receive it, I was somewhat disappointed","This set contains a lot of TV footage, and not much 16mm film footage. Spacecraft Films says that TV footage provides a better picture quality, but I beg to differ.Yes, the 16mm film footage converted to video is ""choppy"" because the framerates don't match, it's quality is excellent. The video is full 30 FPS, but it has ""muddy"" pictures.The audio is sometimes incomprehensible. I had thought this was going to be a professionally digitized product, and I guess my expectations were too high. It could very well be that the source material prohibits any higher quality.Let me just say I am glad I decided to buy only one of these, because I had thought of buying all of them.This set does, however, contain a good historical coverage of the mission."
5,Good repair for my 2002 Civic,Bought this to repair my car's passenger side's mirror. It was very easy to install and it works just as good as the original.
5,Rockabilly on crack!,"Devin Leigh, lead gutarist, paints a vivid landscape of past due bar tabs mixed with sorrow and fury. The seamless harmonies led by his brother relates the tenure that this band has endured. It would be a crime if the public didn't have the fortune to witness this band at it's best. In the days of programed filth, this group leads the way to melodic verses and catchy phrases. This piece of work is like a confession to the obvious, to let go and finally enjoy yourself."
4,TRINITY,"They call me Trinity & Trinity is still my name, bring back to life the old days of the Hilarious slap-stick westerns. These two unrefined yet extreamly fast drawing brothers keep you laughing hard at every scene. If you are into the Funny Westerns, then this DVD must be on your list!Ken BishopPhoenix, AZ"
5,Unique (one of a kind) Film,"Here's yet another film I saw as a young lad. But this isn't just any western comedy...It's got that special something that only comes around ever now and then.Terance Hill does a great job as Trinity. For instance in the opening scene Trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans, which he puts away quite quick...I read on his website that he starved himself for 24 hours in order to do that scene.This is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy.I would also recommend Trinity's third film ""My Name Is Nobody"" which stars Henry Fonda.Anyway...if you like good western fun then I would say buy this dvd and enjoy."
3,TERRIBLE QUALITY PICTURE,"I have purchased the double sided DVD with both movies - They Call Me Trinity and Trinity Is Still My Name. The DVD is recorded by ""Quality Special Products"". What a misleading name. The picture is terrible, like a 3rd copy from a VCR tape. I have the same DVD from German e-m-s in widescreen and with very good picture.I do not recommend buying ""Quality"" recording, it is WASTE OF MONEY."
4,"Great Movie, Wish the DVD was better.","Well I have always enjoyed the Trinity movies & was hoping when I got the DVD I would finally be able to see it in widescreen. But alas this DVD does not contain it. Still the movie is good & the DVD has a neat little trivia game that you can play, though you might want to play it after watching the movie."
5,god these are hilarious,These are so funny and his crabby brother MAKE the film just right. If you like Monty Python's holy grail you'll enjoy these.
3,Yawn.......What's that noise?,It has it's funny moments but it's really slow and there's often an annoying whine in the background.
2,Which version is reviewed?,"There appear to be at least 3 different versions of this DVD for sale on Amazon, each with a different price. Some reviews say the video quality is good, some say it is terrible. It would be helpful if Amazon would indicate which version of this movie each review is associated with so that customers could decide which one to choose."
5,BROUGHT BACK ALOT OF GOOD LAUGHS!!,"I first saw this movie in the mid seventies with my parents in Beirut, Lebanon. Though I did not speak a word of English, this action packed comedy was terrific! I had been looking for this movie for many years now, and finally found it.. Understanding the language, this movie is even funnier now than when I first saw it 23 years ago..The plot and dialogue are exceptional..Of course, you must like old westerns in order to appreciate these types of movies. Terence hill is the life of this movie..Believe me when I tell you that this movie is a perfect addition to any movie library...But you must also get the sequel..""Trinity is still my name"",.. in order to appreciate these two excellent classics!! Take off your boots and kick back in your favorite chair and get ready to laugh at these simple, non bloody, but funny movies.."
1,"Great film, bad disk!","This is a wonderfully funny movie with a great deadpan performance by Terence Hill and his straight man Bud Spencer. Beautifully shot in an over that over the top, true spaghetti western style by Enzo Barboni.That said, the disk is completely worthless. The sound is so bad you can't hear the dialog and the color is so washed out in several scenes you can't make out backgrounds. The version I'm referring to is UPC 890328777067, the 2002, ""region free"" release.If you can find a decent copy of this film, it's well worth the effort."
2,Eh...,"This is a book from the nineties with recipes for kids to make themselves. However, most of the recipes are exotic, with titles like Baby Naans with Winter Salad, and Eggplant Satay with Tomato Marinade. The majority of the recipes have a good deal of vegetables, but also a LOT of chopping and arranging. It seems outdated and too much trouble all at once. Skip it, even if it's used."
5,Good jacket.,"I won't write a review until the product has been put to use for awhile. But Amazon keeps pestering me w/ review requests...so here's a limited review.I ordered this jacket for my Dad's birthday and it came quickly and in factory packaging. The weight I rec'd was 35mm, instead of 50mm. It has turned out for the better, as 50 would probably be best used in monsoon country. My father has used it several times and hasn't mentioned any complaints; throws it on to feed the horses or get the mail. Though it came w/ a detachable button hood instead of an attach/sewn hood, which could possibly allow water to roll up under the hood and over the collar should you stay in bent over position too long, but that hasn't happened yet for him.Otherwise, the jacket is good quality and shipped carefully and expeditiously. Good buy."
4,Great toy - but problem with missing battery cover,"I received this toy as a birthday gift for my daughter, and she loves it. The box and its contents were in their original packaging, but when we flipped over the base to install the batteries, we noticed that the battery cover was missing (yikes! No battery cover could mean big trouble for little kids!). I contacted Fisher-Price to see what could be done, and they informed me that all they could do for me was to have me ship the item back to them AT MY COST and they would then send a replacement piece within 2-4 weeks. So I will just be exchanging it at the store instead. I am disappointed in Fisher-Price for this reaction, especially due to the safety issues that could arise if my child were to pull out the batteries since there is no cover (no, I don't leave them in there, that was just an example). But overall my daughter loves the toy - just make sure you get all the pieces with yours."
4,Interesting,"In some respects, Markale reveals much about the Druids. In other areas he seemed to quote more from others' views than his own.I found his opinion of New Age and Wiccan attempts to co-opt Druid traditions,enlightening.He clarifies the observances and sacred elements well. A good read."
5,a review on one of the greatest books ever.,this is the best book there is about druidism. buy it now
1,lot of nonsense,"a lot of nonsense thrown together to sell to would-be modern pagans. At least they don't ask for ""offerings."" I respect this style of fund raising far better."
3,Good value,This product arrived as described. Great value compared to the OEM phone companys. Unfortunately the shipping doubled the price and I was charged double shipping for 2 items that came in the same envelope.
5,Good,Battery lasted about 8 monthes before I needed to replace it which was about how long the new battery that came with the phone lasted.
3,Motorolla SNN 5762,"Shipping was fast. The replacement battery from this retailer (WirelessFinest) doesn't match up to my expectation. I don't know if I have a problem with my charger but I have notice that the battery shows signs of bulging (not a good thing). And after a little over of a month of recharge cycles, the battery does not hold the charge that long. I say, you're getting what you've paid for. This $10.93 battery (includes shipping, $5.95 for the battery alone) compared to the $39 replacement at the cellphone store will do OK if you don't mind buying 3-4 replacements per year. The lesson? For batteries that cost less than $10-15, I think its a rip off."
1,Does not hold charge,"I ordered the battery for a phone I no longer used but I preferred the phone to my current phone. The battery charges to ""full charge"" very quickly but it loses the charge almost as fast as it charges. It will not even hold a charge for a day when the phone is turned off. I would not recomment this to anyone."
5,good battery,I bought a battery and it was not holding a charge so I brought it to the attention of customer service and they sent me another one free of charge and I no longer have a problem.
4,A Smash-Hit,"My 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter absolutely love this book. At the same time, it's interesting and smart. My kids particularly love learning about some obscure animals with unique traits."
2,Not enough of a story,My almost 4 year old didn't get too excited about this one and neither did I. There's not enough going on unless you go into detail about each animal and that takes too long and gets boring. We were hoping for a story but this is not a story. No plot.
5,A lot of fun and some learning too!,"My six-year-old enjoys reading this book with me. He likes to guess which animal goes with which body part that's presented on one page and then discussed on the next page. It's a great way to introduce young kids to the animal kingdom. In the back of the book there are detailed entries on all of the animals mentioned. Every time we read the book, we pick out a handful of these to go over together."
5,One of the Best,"Both of my children LOVE this book. They actually fight over it for a bed time story. My daughter, who is 7, reads it to me at night and my son, who is 5, loves to match the animals. It it a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who has children over 4 years old."
3,"Not as great as the reviews, for us anyway.","This book received great reviews, so I bought it, but was disappointed. It is just not a book my daughter would like to hear over and over. But, every child is different and many do like this one."
1,I'm not impressed,"If you have a crappy stereo unit and are used to poor sounding audio, then this unit is for you. This is a poorly designed unit which takes a digital signal from space and turns it into the quality of a scratched LP record. If you have a high-end stereo system, you will not be happy with how this sounds at all."
4,Fighting fear and succeeding!,"This book Running Scared is a very exciting book. Larry Hudson is a senior at Marlin State College and is afraid to play football because of getting hurt. Towards the end of the season he wants to quit, but is afraid of what people will call him. I liked the way Larry didn`t quit and got up his strength and did what noone ever thought he would do..... I also like the way Thomas J. Dygard makes it seem like your`re there. This book is aewesome."
2,Too much of a good thing,"If you have enjoyed Susana Baca's earlier CDs you will find something rather different here. Her lovely voice is overshadowed by the backup musicians. Good as they are, they transform a wonderful original into a carbon copy of so many other singers turned stars. And to top it all off they shamelessly use the events of 9/11 to promote the cd.Stick to her earlier recordings."
2,Not as good as previous albums,"I hardly ever listen to this album, because in comparison to Susana Baca and Eco de Sombras I think it's not that interesting. It's nice, but just not as amazingly incredible as those two albums."
5,A great recording!,This is a great album. You will enjoy it! The words are clear and the music is very well done. Everyone who hears it asks me to get them a copy the next time I am in Kenya.
2,Unhappy with quality,"When the salad set arrived, there was DIRT on one piece while the other was scratched. If it had not been for those obvious and unneccesary blemishes, the set would have been very attractive."
4,Great Guide!,"This is a great guide - we are currently moving from Northwest Arkansas to Liberty County, Texas, and this guide will be very helpful in helping us to identify snakes we are not used to, and helping our four children to know which snakes are bad snakes. The pictures are beautiful, and I like that under most pictures, there is a label identifying where the snake was found (some poisonous in Liberty and Polk Counties!!!).The only thing we do not like about the guide is that it isn't divided into regions of Texas - Texas is a huge state and it would be easier to look up a snake quickly if it were divided into regions of Texas rather than families of snakes. The poisonous snakes do have their own section, though, which is good. There is also good information about snakes in the front of the book. The descriptions of each snake are very thorough and we like reading about the habitats of different snakes.We hope to find more wildlife guides like this one on Texas snakes."
3,"Pictures. Maps Description of habitat, lacking in poisonous ID","The pictures are alright. It has a map on each individual. It would be nice if the had the field guide AND a section in the front of poisonous snakes that could harm a human as a quick go to. I bought this because we moved out into East Texas in the Pineywoods and swamp lands. LOTS OF SNAKES. I wanted it because I don't want to harm beneficial snakes; I however do not want to leave a copperhead near my house. I find the book interested, but not very helpful in what I needed it for."
2,A lot of hipe,"I've recently been buying Christian albums from the eighties that I missed. I was delighted to hear of a band that was compared to Rush. Now that I own the album I can say that it is just another mediocre Christian band with fairly poor musicianship. The singer does sound like the Rush lead singer, but it doesn't make up for the extremely weak playing. The guitar leads aren't even close to par for the guitar work of the time. As is the case for so many of the Christian groups at the time, this band would have never been signed on a secular label as their talent didn't warrant it."
4,"Good, good stuff","Been using this for almost two years. Feel pleasantly filled out and solid while it's in the system. Can be depended on to supply consistent energy under physically demanding situations. Great if you work in a warehouse. Can also be taken before bed to maintain anabolic(?) body condition. Only slight concern- it does have some fat, so, it feels like might have gained a gram or two after usage. Normally that feeling subsides hours after ingestion. Overall Very good product. As good or better than much higher priced supplements, way, way over muscle milk. WAY over muscle milk."
5,Incredibly Beautiful Blue,"I highly recommend this album for its sincerity, compassion, melodic jumps with ease, and utter beauty. The best example of the control and power she has over her voice comes during 2:20 - 2:25 in her wonderful song, ""California."" Her album will free you from the blues, and make you want to turn up the volume."
5,The Brightness and Exuberance Of Melancholy,"The loveliness of Joni has always been her understanding of the vulvnerabilities, mystery and confusion of life amidst the honesty of her lyrics and bittersweet beauty of her tunes..portraying existence as some wonderous revealation...Indeed these remasters (hdcd) are refreshing.This cd may be her finest but she is best approached as an album artist rather then a single maker and I equally think Court and Spark,Ladies Of The Canyon,Hejira,Hissing all stand up on their own but this Blue is the one that she will be remembered by.Great Hippie songwriters and musicians accompany her here,James Taylor, Stephen Stills and what is funny I recall the UK Glam era rockers covering her This Flight Tonight....You can get some great live renditions of some of these cuts on her Misles Of Aisles which is a nice segue into her later period fusing a jazz sensibility into her older hits and music."
5,Sounds as good today as it did thirty years ago,"When I was in college in the seventies, I don't think I knew a single woman who didn't own this album. Joni Mitchell put into gorgeous words exactly what it felt like to be a young wooman at that time. A couple of years ago, I dug out my old vinyl copy, remembering little more than a few lyrics like ""we don't need a piece of paper from the city hall,"" and expecting some really dated hippie stuff. Something embarassingly sweet from the old days. I was stunned at how well the songs hold up. There's not a bit of sixties' sappiness in it. The songs are simply timeless and wonderful. This is one of only a handful of vinyl albums that I've replaced with CDs because I want to be able to listen to it over and over again."
5,Beautifull,"Sad, spare, and beautiful, Blue is the quintessential confessional singer/songwriter album. Forthright and poetic, Joni Mitchell's songs are raw nerves, tales of love and loss etched with stunning complexity; even tracks like ""All I Want,"" ""My Old Man,"" and ""Carey"" -- the brightest, most hopeful moments on the record -- are darkened by bittersweet moments of sorrow and loneliness. At the same time that songs like ""Little Green"" and the title cut raise the stakes of confessional folk-pop to new levels of honesty and openness, Mitchell's music moves beyond the constraints of acoustic folk into more intricate and diverse territory, setting the stage for the experimentation of her later work. Unrivaled in its intensity and insight, Blue remains a watershed."
4,"creative melodies, many heart-hitting messages , others not",I enjoyed most of this CD - I think the rest will grow on me in time
3,Joni Mitchell CD,"I would return the CD if I could, it just wasn't my style, and I like Joni Mitchell."
5,Amazing Voice,"I'm not normally into this sort of music, but I was once loaned the album by a girlfriend, and I think it's fantastic. Her voice is murmurous and so smooth. I think she has the best voice of any of them. And the songs are pretty good too, most of them simple arrangements of acoustic guitar and voice, occassionally augmented by the mid-song arrival of James Taylor (""Case of You"") or Steven Stills (""California"") on backing guitar, which fills up the space nicely. A few songs are on piano. Despite the some of the lyrics, it is an upbeat album in the end, written during Joni's prolific phase during the early 70s before she had wavered into jazz and before she'd quite ceased being official groupie of Crosby Stills Nash and Young. Anyway, Joni sings like no other on this album. I love ""Case of You"" and ""River""."
5,Blue... ooh...ooh...ooh,A mostly melancholy record that is quite uplifting (strange as the artist herself)... I've listened to this disc hundreds of times and never tire of it. A masterpiece. So buy it already.
1,housewife mediocrity,this album might fly when the hippy flag was not yet torn to complete shreds and everyone was feeling a little blue but i'm sorry joni i just don't care about you and your songs are self-indulgent in a way that just makes me feel annoyed and further from christlove that even Prince Myshkin could ever imagine. When joni is blue i don't want to come in your kitchen. . . period.
2,Where was Prozac when Joni needed it!!!,"I feel so sorry for Joni. If only prozac were available in the early seventies, everyone would have been spared the misery that is this album. Joni couldn't even crack a smile on the album cover. Joni, honey, I implore you to smile, and create happy music."
1,Boring!!,I am sorry but this is definitly one of the worst albums ever. I couldnt find one good song on the whole thing but I bought it anyway because I though I had to like this album but I listend to it 2 times straight through and didnt like it....well then CRTISIZE my personal taste...not my rating.I dont recommend this album.
4,Butterfly songstress,Utterly enchanting female folk can hang with the best singer-songwriter material of its era and beyond.
5,"The original, and still the best","Every time I read a glowing, hyped-up review of some new female singer-songwriter (Nelly Furtado, Norah Jones and Vanessa Carlton immediately spring to mind) and then hear their work, I usually think, ""why bother?"" Joni Mitchell is the beginning and end of female singer-songwriters -- actually, she belongs up there with Dylan and the Beatles as far as artistry and far-ranging influence are concerned. Even artists I like and respect (Tori Amos, Aimee Mann, Jonatha Brooke, etc.) would be nowhere without Joni cutting that first, difficult path for them to follow. ""Blue"" is her first totally mature, uncompromised album; it is adult, spare, beautiful, saturated with desire, longing and regret. Her singing is amazing; the lyrics are astonishingly provocative and vivid. It paved the way for everything afterward, and no one yet has even come close to its greatness."
4,Rediscovered delight,"My mom used to play this record all the time when I was a kid. My response always used to be, ""Oh Mom, puhleeze!"" But I decided to get it on CD recently and I'm surprized by how much I like it. Mom wasn't so wrong after all. Songs from the heart, music that reaches into the depths of the soul. It's timeless."
5,One of the Top Ten Albums Ever Made,"As a singer growing up in the sixties, I was heavily influenced by Joni Mitchell--her vocal style, her complex melodies, the gorgeous poetry of her lyrics. Very few singers today can begin to approach the artistry of a woman whose career has spanned decades and to whom countless artists give an admiring nod as having been a profound influence on their own music.This is as good as it gets. I felt that way 30 years ago and I still feel that way today. If I had only one CD to take with me to a deserted island, this would be it.In my opinion, the only younger artist out there today that has her kind of writing and singing chops is John Mayer. He gives me hope that the timeless music of artists like Joni and The Beatles (to name only two of many) will continue to be made, however grim the music business might look."
2,I hate the sparseness of the instrumentation,"CARY: The only track with bass & drums. Another additional benefit is the background singing.CALIFORNIA: This is the one with the steel guitar (at least it's something).MY OLD MAN: Right after ""frying pan"", there's a brief piano passage that sounds like Paul Bowles.A CASE OF YOU: It's a dud track and my guess is that this non-tune was written around the pre-written lyric."
1,Pretentious And Overrated,"I have no idea how this album EVER got such positive reviews. Joni Mitchell is perhaps the most pretentious, talentless artist of all time, and this album is one big snore.I grew up with this album (my sister played it nonstop), so I can confidently state that Blue is pompous, self-important, self-obsessed, me, me, me, and therefore BORING.Most people who say they like this album do so because they're supposed to. Stop the madness! Do not buy this album if you have not done so. Cheap Trick forever."
1,"Please Smile Joni, its only Love","Joni sounds oh so sad and depressed on this album, like she lost her best friend. I want to paint her a happy face, and remind her there is so much more to life than unrequited love. Please Joni, keep your chin up, and smile, if only for a little while. Damn those blues away!!!!!!!!!!!."
1,dull and boring,i read the reviews of people who bought this and said buy this cd it's great and i went out and did it and i regret doing it after listening to this cd i can understand why no radio stations play her music in my city not 1 station.her voice is really awful.and the music is enough to put anyone to sleep.you wanna hear good folk music listen to love's forever changes or the kink's 68 masterpiece village green preservation society.this is the last time i go by other people.i can see why less and less people even know who joni mitchell is anymore.like her fans she is a dying breed.
1,Pretentious garbage,How can anyone like this talentless woman? She can't sing and is absolutely egotistical (name an artist she hasn't dissed). Try listening to some female singer/songwriters who are good at what they do!
2,Very disappointed,We are very disappointed in this toaster. Browning is very uneven. Only nice thing is that it is extra deep.
1,Angry,I did not ever receive this book and never received a refund from the seller. Failed a test in part due to this an unavailability at several books stores.
4,Simpsons' Road Rage,"Simpsons' Road Rage is a typical taxi car game. You first pick a player like Bart Simpson, Marge, Homer, Lisa, and etc. Then you pick up other people and drive them to their destination. That part's fun, then it gets worse. One flaw for this pretty good game is that the mission mode is unbelievabaly easy. I just picked up the controller and started mission mode and completed more than four levels! Another flaw for the Simpson's Road Rage is that the characters in this game look totally unreal and the heads look like bobbleheads. It just makes me want to punch the TV screen. Also, the mouths don't even match with the voices! Language in worse in the game than in the TV show, so don't get as a birthday present to a 5 year-old. Next time you meet them, they might just start saying ""just shut up and drive."" DO NOT GET IT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! Still, this game is a little above average. Maybe you should rent the game before buying it."
4,the simple yet funny game,This game is a funny racing typ game. It has ok graghics and has a fun plot it isn't just racing. It is a game were you bring people to there disiered place. In short you act like a taxi cab driver. You have a choice of all the main charicters in the moivies. Each have there own car. This is a very fun two player game and I suggest it to every one. It isn't what I call thrilling but it is very fun and is an eaisy game.
4,A must for Simpsons Fans.,"As a Simpsons fan, this game is a must. The Editorial provides an excellent review. The graphics are decent, you can tell the game was ported and rushed. It doesn't do the X-box justice. That doesn't matter, because the gameplay is extremely fun and there is huge re-play value. Extremely fast and easy to play. Definately the bet Simpsons game out there (Not saying much if you played all the others :) )."
2,So bad its amusing,"This game is amusing, stupid, and wierd. It is a copy of crazy taxi with a lot of stupid extras (that make the game even worste.) Do yourself a favor, and do not buy this game."
3,"Fun, but gets old fast","This game is pretty good but it has it's ups and downs. First of all, the characters are very funny, it has many features from crazy taxi, you can unlock many new characters and levels,The surrounding enviorment such as cars, mailboxes, trees, poles, and some doors to certain buildings can be trashed, but it starts to become pointless. You just keep playing a level until you get enough money for a hidden character or level. The sayings stay funny for a while but soon become the same old [junk]. Still this game should be bought due to it's still worthy of the XBOX."
2,Doh!,"I initially held off getting Simpson's Road Rage after some mediocre reviews. Well, after this self-imposed waiting period, I finally broke down and bought it. Man am I sorry I did! The graphics don't take advantage of the Xbox's capabilities. The controls are buggy. Most annoyingly, as much as I like the Simpsons, the phrases are too repetative and the gameplay is just plain boring! Save your money. Rent it if you have to, but do not buy it. Shame on you Electronic Arts for spoiling Springfield! Jebediah Springield would turn over in his grave if he saw this."
3,"Not good, but not bad","It's a fun game if you like the Simpsons (who doesn't), but it's not a game to intrigue you for long period of times. It's fun to go and bust stuff up, play around, but it's easy, and frustrating at times. There are some flaws with the game, but you get used to them after a while. Long loading time, even between ""runs"" creates spells of boredom. There are much better games you could spend money on, but avid Simpson fans will enjoy this one. It is comparable to Crazi Taxi, but seems to play better and easier. The Simson twist is a grand idea, and I hope EA will release a better version in the future."
4,Great Racing Game,Simpsons Road Rage is a great racing game. It has a lot of funny comentary from your favorite characters and has controls that are very easy to learn. It has 3 main mode with an additional multi mode. Road Rage mode is like crazy taxi. You need to pick up passengers and drop them at their requested locations. Mission Mode is when you have to complete certain missions for characters before time runs out. Sunday mode is when you can drive around at your own pace and explore the town. This is game should be rated 4.5 stars. It is a fun game for people who have a sense of humor and like the Simpsons.
2,Too old,"It was my mistake I guess, but this game is for the first Xbox, so it is kind of too old. I wish they would have the same one for the new Xbox."
4,Why the price?,"I played this alot when I was younger, and then Hit and Run came out and is MUCH better then this game. So if you just want a Simpsons game, buy Hit and Run. And also, why is the price $75?! Are you insane? It's worth $10 at the most... This game was made in 2001 or something like that."
5,dont look at the other reviews,this is way better than crazy taxi and is great to play head to head with a friend. a must for any real gamer!
3,THE BEST GAME EVER!,this game is good the only thing i dont like about it is that after you beat it there is no point in playing it anymore except its fun for the multi player games other then that it is not fun WORST GAME EVERE!
2,Yet another lousy licensed game,"The Simpsons: Road Rage is, at best, a Crazy Taxi wannabe. This is the worst title I've played on the Xbox yet. The Crazy Taxi premise is okay - CT is one of my favorite games - but Road Rage suffers on many levels.The voice talent, while authentic, is very limited. Characters start repeating phrases within the space of a single run. It's annoying.The graphics are a cross between bad cel-shading and an intern's first attempt at 3D extrusion. Blech.The load times before and after each run are insane. I wonder if it's not a result of a ""simple"" port from one platform to another. This game was clearly not designed to take advantage of the Xbox's memory or graphic capabilities.Rent it, play it, then get it out of your system - literally and figuratively."
2,This game is a rental (from a huge Simpsons fan)...,"Graphics are well done, although you'll never get the level of character detail found on the actual Simpson's cartoon... Gameplay is very straightforward although I was able to get the car ""stuck"" easily by going off some jumps and flipping over.However, the game lacks the depth that games SHOULD possess for the XBOX platform... there are only 5 town areas and they are very quickly covered. Replay value is very low. Characters are well done (although they all have the same animation patterns). The voiceovers are the best part of the game in terms of entertainment value for Simpsons fans(""Thank you, come again"" -Apu)..."
5,Addictive game!,"This game is good for gamers and Simpson fans. The real character voices are cool and hilarious at the same time. My favorite is Ralph who says what's on his mind even if it has nothing to do with anything else. I picked him up downtown and he said, ""Can I go to the airport? I wanna take a suitcase ride!"" Another favorite saying of his is, ""Fireworks make my ears yell!"""
5,The best game for kids,My 5 year old LOVES this game! It's also quite fun for any adults also. Highly recommended.
2,"Good program, Bad game","Same old, same old. If you played Crazy Taxi, then you played Simpsons Road Rage. The olny good thing about it is the voices."
5,Simpsons,"If you are a fan of Simpsons, you will probably love this game. It gets you addicted and you want to find out what will happen in the end."
1,very low quality for the price,"I bought this for our homeschool classroom. I thought it would be a fun alternative to a chalk or typical dry erase board. For the price, I was not impressed. The finish of the board had bubbles in it, and several spots where it was scratched off. The edging is not sturdy or heavy. This looks basically like your typical $20 white board, just black and $40 more (only I've never seen a white board with bubbles and scratches, even cheap ones). We returned it and are getting a classroom quality white board from a school supply website instead, for $20 less!"
2,Poor quality for the price.,"The black metal edging around the outside of the markerboard is poorly manufactured -- it appears dented at two corners and the welded seam on one side is misaligned so that the board does not have a true rectangular shape. Bottom line: a black markerboard seems like a good idea, but this one looks cheap and is not worth the price."
1,boring,was disappointed with this product i expected the songs on the cd to be original not remakes from different artist. the product took a while to arrive.
2,El Cheapo!,"[July 17, 2011-Disclaimer: I wrote a review on the 5-CD boxset put out by the ""CHEAPOLATA"" label. It bears a title that matches exactly with two other boxsets by two different record labels. I never dreamt that Amazon.com and Amazon UK would insert my review in all three CD boxsets automatically. If I offend or offended anybody, it's really not my fault.]Don't waste your hard-earn $$$ on this box set! Yes, the compilation includes many many great soul hits. But too many are re-recordings, and some of the voices in these tracks are unrecognizable. In other words, you don't know who the real singers are behind the mircophone. The best way to describe this boxset is: a little above-average Karaoke singers singing the soul hits of yester-years.Another interesting thing I like to point out is that the word ""CHEAPOLATA"" is printed on the back of the thin cardboard box that houses the 5 CDs. Is that the name of the Label? if it is, then it's extremely appropriate and self-serving!"
2,Godai no fun,"I initially bought this game because it had to things that I liked: Ninjas and the ability to control the elements. Once I started playing I found that the game was lacking in several areas.First the camera, you can't control the view at all and so if you get into any of the platforming areas, you're pretty much blind because you can't see all the options available to you. You'll see one platform in front of you but not the ones to your left and right.Next is the control. While the combos are pretty cool, you can't change your direction of attack once you start it so if you miss, you're screwed.The weapons do degrade as you use them so it adds a touch of realism so at least there was some effort.The voices for the characters suck...a lot. Think of a bad voiced-over martial arts movie and take it down another notch and you'll have Godai. The story's pretty solid though. I would definitly recommend renting it before buying."
1,I tried to like this game but...,I really did try to enjoy this game but I just couldn't. While the graphics are ok at best that is the only thing I like about this game. While it has many different weapons they weaken and break when you use them and are forced to fight without them. The game play hardly ever changes. Each element has the same type of enemies only with a different element. The game is also too short. Save your money for another game that is worth buying. If you are looking for a good action game this is NOT it. A game that I would highly recommend would be Dynasty Warriors 3. If you are still interested in this game I recommended you rent it to be sure because I bought it and I am sorry I did..
4,Bad budget is the only crutch,"George A. Romero's film,although filled with wooden acting, possesses some pretty interesting ideas. Romero's always been the master, in my book, of sneaking in a pretty neat little sub-text. In the zombie films, i suppose it had something to do with anxiety of the respective time periods in which each film was made and in this film it's obviously Feminism.The film doesn't come off as too exploitative (although it was originally marketed as an adult film) and the bored suburban housewife schtick is milked with some pretty warped and even hilarious results.Although it's not always in the foreground, there is a fascinating little commentary on medical experiments and the shift in medical research in the sixties ( I'm thinking of the scene where that near-senior citizen gets "" turned on"" to pot) Pretty clever stuff."
3,Unique...,"Season of the Witch is one of George A. Romero's films that you would find ironic. Overall the film is pretty good, but some parts are kind of dull."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Romero is at his all time worst in SOW. This movie reaches the utter limits of boredom. The acting is similar to that of ametuer night at your home town theatre. Forgive me, for I am a Romero fan, but I have no other way of describing this movie other than coming right out and saying: IT SUCKED THEN, IT SUCKS NOW, AND IT WILL SUCK TOMORROW!!! Buy THE CRAZIES instead you'll thank me for it...trust me. Just rent SOW watch the first two mintutes of it if you can bear to and you'll understand where I'm coming from."
1,One of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life!,"I didn't know horror was a bunch of people talking for 90 minutes. Because this is exactly what this movie is. If you think that this movie will be a terrifying gore-fest like Romero's other movies, YOU'RE WRONG!!! What you get is a movie with all dialog and a few stupid, no scary ""dream scenes"". The only thing I liked about this movie is when they showed downtown Pittsburgh for about 5 seconds. The best part of this movie is when the screen reads ""THE END"" ! Save yourself some time and money and DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!"
3,Two strange films by George A. Romero,"This DVD features the second and third films by the ""horror director"" George A. Romero. Nevertheless, none of each is really horror oriented. There's Always Vanilla is a romantic drama depicting the 70's atmosphere, whereas Season of the Witch is a housewife portrait. Both of them are difficult to watch, but necessary for die hard Romero fans. The quality of the image and the sound is good on There's Always Vanilla, whereas on Season of the Witch, it's not clean at all. By the way, although the title of the movie is Season of the Witch, it seems to be the Hungry Wives cut (the French DVD release contains more witchcraft scenes and less dialogue). The bonus are interesting, the documentary is cool, and the interview of the director is out of the ordinary.As a conclusion, this DVD is destined to Romero fans only !"
4,Very interesting Romero,"This one goes way back to when he used to direct, write, shoot, and edit the films. It certainly has its flaws and drags in places, but this is from the time when he was making some of the most original, entertaining movies around. It's fairly certain you'll never see another film quite like this -- although his own MARTIN has much of the same feel. Rather introspective. Be warned, the budget constraints can be felt when viewing this film. On the other hand, Romero consistently proved during this period that large budgets do not make the movie. Oh yeah... it has a very effective climax, as well. SEASON doesn't have the same visceral shocks of MARTIN, but I'd say go watch the latter film first. If you like it, chances are good you'll really enjoy this one as well."
2,"Very cute, but not a good value.....","I ordered this a couple of weeks ago as a gift for my mother. I ended up returning it the same day I received it. I was dissapointed in the way the product was presented. True, the charms come in a cute little velvet-like pouch, but the product itself comes in a small plastic bag stapled to a cardboard back. For the price, and because I was giving it as a gift, I thought it should be presented a little better. (How about a nice box with the bag in the middle and the charms displayed on the side?) The price has dropped since I ordered/returned this item, but I still think it would need to drop a little more to make this item a good value. The concept is great, the charms are cute and they're useful for parties, but if you're looking for a nice gift, you may want to look at something else. I guess there really is something to be said for presentation...."
1,Way too expensive,"Are they kidding? A set of wine glass charms for [that much]. Please, a bag of plain hoop earrings that you can buy at any craft store with a few charms from the beading section of that craft store and you've got an endless supply of glass charms with unlimited variety. And for just a few dollars! Get crafty people!"
5,"Before another Holiday dinner, I need to get some of these!","I was telling a friend of mine about these nifty things, and she was questioning the actual ""usefulness"" of them. So, swayed by my lack of ability to demonstrate ""usefulness"" on the spot, I did not buy them.Then I had 9 people over for Thanksgiving. We all had wine, in matching wineglasses. No one could remember where they'd put their glass, or which one was theirs. These little babies would have solved quite a bit of confusion (and glass-swapping, I'm afraid) So, before another holiday dinner, I need to set myself up with some of these babies. No more hassle! Yay!"
4,Cute and useful,"These charms are quite useful at dinner parties to differentiate different guests' drinks. The quality of construction is actually pretty solid and detailed. However, the bag that came with the charms were a bit of a disappointment- rather flimsy. I got these during one of the Friday Sales, and it was worth the [money] price paid for these. While these are well made and useful, they are not worth the full regular price."
3,"Fun, but expensive.","Think Monopoly pieces. This is a little bit what they look like. These charms are fun, but are expensive...Wait to get them on sale! They come in a box that would make a nice housewarming gift for a friend."
1,Not the best out there!,"Though this is a decent product, there are many other of the same type that are much better!!!!..."
5,Adds fun to any glass of wine,"What a fun product! That Wine is Mine is great for entertaining a few friends or at a party. I found them about a year ago and just had to have a set. I now have Vineyard, Buds & Bugs and Grapevine. Everyone enjoys picking out what they want to be for the night ... frog, wine bottle, cork, ladybug, grapes, cheese, glass, etc. They make a great gift for the person that has everything. You can pick them to match the personality of the person you give them to. I have seen some knockoffs but these are the best by far. Stick with the original ""That Wine is Mine"" Have fun!"
5,"Magic, love, evil in Kansas","Reamy's only published novel, we encounter characters of clear definition and some true magic. Our protagonist is capable of self flight, and the use of flying in this story is amazing. Throw in a love story that is charming and innocent, add some good old fashioned revenge and violence and you have a hell of little book. Makes you wonder what Reamy could have accomplished had he lived a little longer. Also, try San Diego Lightfoot Sue and Other Stories, his only other book. More magic."
1,Optical mouse doesn't work at all on this...,"My optical mouse by Logitech does not work at all. Put it on bare desk, works fine, put it on mousepad, NOTHING. Not even a wiggle. Maybe it's just my mouse but I don't understand this!"
3,It works fine,"It's a mouse pad. It works fine. Honestly, how could a mouse pad work incorrectly? Would the company manufacture it out of sand paper?"
1,A mousepad that doesn't work?!,so i have a Logitech M215 wireless optical mouse that DOES NOT WORK with this mouse pad. I think that sais it all - did not expected this
4,Mouse pad,Its a mouse pad. If you are looking for a mouse pad at a good price this is a mouse pad for you.
4,Just what I wanted,"I don't get why people would spend a lot of money on ""better branded"" mouse pads for gaming. This is more than enough."
4,Typical mousepad.,"I bought it for my boyfriend, he says he likes it. It's a pretty typical mouse pad for pretty cheap."
3,Its a mouse Pad...,"It is ""regular"" thickness. I like the really thin kind. I knew that this was not when I ordered it, I just needed a mouse pad. A year later and it still looks like the day I bought it."
5,Great bargain.,Unbelievable quality for the price. It's worth much more! This is perfect if you need a mouse pad without a wrist rest.
3,Mousepad,"I bought the mousepad to get above the $[...] limit required for shipping on another item. This is pretty much the first time I've ever had to pay for a mousepad.As far as mousepads go, this one is thick. It is 1/4"" or 5 mm. The top is smooth, and works well with my wireless laser mouse. The bottom is a rubbery textured surface to prevent slip. The black color blends in well with my black desk.I don't think I'd ever pay for it again though. Promotional mousepads passed out for free do the same job for me, are thinner and more portable."
1,This is not similiar to other Belkin pad material,"I guess sometimes you just get what you pay for. In this case, you really do get what you pay for. The material in this small pad is cheap. It's not made of the same material of the Belkin pad which has a gel pad at the top. I own that one, and the material is much more smooth, and feels better. It has an extra two layers which really make it more comfortable. This mouse pad is like a one dollar item. It's hardly even worth 3 dollars, and I guess some people might think its worth that. But, overall its not something that I would want to use long term underneath my mouse, or anywhere under my hand.Pros- can't think of anycons- everything, uncomfortable material, seems cheapI would recommend spending more money on a nicer pad. Even one about the same price, you may get something more comfortable."
3,Works Great But Smells Bad,"For the price, this is a great deal. This works perfectly.My only complaint is the smell. The smell lessens after a while but it doesn't seem to go away completely.It will always have this weird smell."
5,Just got it!!!,"Just got mine, thin but who cares still soft, had a sheet of cardboard before. Seems well made, took like two days to get here, doesn't slip at all when used and looks great on my black glass computer table top, been looking for one for a while but didn't want to spend the nine dollars to get a large black one, usually the edges curl up so why spend a lot, three bucks and fee shipping very satisfied."
4,Nice pad,"very soft, flexible.I like it.It will better if it can be larger.But it still a good pad for its price."
2,"good, i like","the most noticeable thing u will notice is a smell on ur hands. u dont know what it is and it might take u a couple days to narrow it down like it took me. the mousepad has a weird smell to it. it DOES go away if that even matters to u or if u cant wait until then. i didnt even notice the smell was gone until i got the notification to leave a review for this. simple pad, good size."
3,It is a mouse pad.,Nothing spectacular about this mouse pad. Do not use it anymore because I have acquired a cordless mouse which uses laser technology.
3,smells horrible.,"While the price of this product is unbeatable, you will wish you could feel the same about its smell.It functions as a mouse pad from back in the 1990's with the added bonus of a rubberized bottom to prevent slipping.However, similar to a previous reviewer, the smell is unbearable.The smell to me is like old cigarettes and is difficult to wash off.I actually went ahead and ordered the3M Mouse Pad with Precise Battery Saving Mousing Surface (MP200PS)when I purchased this belkin, the latter of which is headed straight for the garbage. I suggest you do the same."
4,A good pad,"There's not much one can be critical about when discussing mouse pads, is there? The product arrived fairly quickly, was in perfect condition, and ""works"" fine. No complaints from me."
1,Smells freaking terrible,"Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this mouse pad... cause its a basic mouse pad, which is what you want. Problem is, the things smells freaking terrible. I've washed it twice and the smell is still pretty bad and stays on my hands after using it. Its cheap, but don't get this product... its not worth it."
1,"Smells so bad you cannot use it, like a burnt tire","and then the smell sticks to your hand... that's why it costs less than $3. Pressed on Return Item , described it as defective and got the sale price back.did not need to return it back... no one really wants it back."
1,Smells of Chemicals,"A Mouse pad is a mouse pad, I don't think any manufacturer can get it wrong. But this one smells horrible - Buyers beware it smells of chemicals I don't understand what they are. Since it is dirt cheap I am just going to throw it away, but hopefully other buyers read my review and look elsewhere.Where is Belkin quality control on this?"
1,Toxic,"These mouse pads are made from/with some kind of toxic petroleum industrial solvent that increasingly is in ""rubber"" products out of China. They emit a horrendous toxic odor that quickly fills the entire house. It is not only extremely unpleasant, but poisonous. I'm leaving my mouse pads out in the sun for a few days to see if it will go away, but from my experience with other recent cheap Chinese ""rubber"" products, the odor/fumes likely will never fully go away.DO NOT BUY THESE!"
1,The smell is intolerance,"When I'first get the pad, The smell is extremely awful. I thought it might be better after a day or two. But the offend odor is still there, even when I put it in the passage that air can circulate for couple days. The material is not fit for anything used near human or alive things."
5,Belkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black),"First, shipping was on point. It wasn't folded or anything and it was packaged very nicely. Looks to be a promising product. I've had it for about two weeks or so. I cant really go into details but for the most part it does what computer mouse pads are supposed to do. This product is a great bang for your buck."
4,It Is What It Is,"It's a good mouse pad. I got it for my wireless mouse and it works pretty good.Not sure if it's a mouse problem or a mouse pad problem, but sometimes the mouse doesn't move on my screen when the mouse pad is laid flat. If this isn't a mouse pad problem, then there is no problem.Would buy it again."
4,Good price but smelly,"I got this mousepad because it was cheap. It has a rubber backing to keep it from sliding around on my glass desktop, which is more than I can say for the mousepads they sell at Ikea. The mousepad does smell like plastic for a while but it goes away."
2,Smells for a while,"It's cheap and of pretty good quality. My main gripe was that it smelled strongly of rubber when it first arrived. I tried to wash it but it still smelled. After a few months of usage the smell has gone away mostly, but definitely not something I would buy again."
3,Mouse pad,I bought this mouse pad to use in my home office. It is small so it does not crowd my desk and is functional.
2,Smells terrible!,"I bought four of them. I put one under a radio and one for my mouse. I noticed a bad smell and started getting a bad headache.I couldn't take it and went to bed. The next day the nasty smell was still there. I cleaned everything I could think of, sniffing around. Finally I smelled one of the mouse pads. Wow, nasty! I took the other two out of the package and they smelled just as bad. I tried washing them, and it did bring the smell down a bit, but they still smell terrible. I tried to put up with it, but it starts giving me a headache for some reason. Not sure if there's something I can do to get rid of the smell or just toss them."
3,It will do the job.,Mouse pads are pretty much all the same so it's hard to give a review. I will say that I like the padding underneath and the texture on top BUT the black color started to lighten up in different spots after about 90 days. It does the job it was made for.
2,Incompatible with apple mouse,"it looks greet . and smooth , but for me it difficulty to use it with apple magic mouse ."
1,smells HORRIBLE; do not buy,"do NOT buy this; it has an exceedingly strong chemical smell, that will not go away (I've washed it thoroughly in dish soap, multiple times, left it out in the sun, done everything I can think of, but absolutely nothing works, and this is months later). If you put it at your desk and try to use it, the smell will quickly overpower you. Deserves 0 stars. Unusable."
1,My optical mouse doe not work,"I purchased this mouse pad based on reviews and price, bad idea. My optical mouse does not work with the pad. I tried a different mouse and same problem."
3,"Good Quality, Bad Smell",Bought this few days ago and overall quality and functionality is good. Except the terrible smell. It has a really strong odor which is noticeable while you are using it. May consider replacing it if the smell doesn't go away soon.
1,Worst smell ever (minus 5 stars),"Do not purchase this mouse pad! The smell is truly offensive. We attempted to return the item and I was required to pay postage for a $2.99 purchase. To help improve the smell I washed it with dish soap but still the pad smelled horrific, I then placed it in the washer machine on delicate and again the pad came out smelling bad. I am upset not only with the seller but Amazon as well; this seller is selling unusable items and I feel I have been ripped off. I will take a buying hiatus from Amazon just on principle. The product is labeled Belkin so there are two possibilities it either is not a Belkin product or Belkin standards have fallen to an abysmal level."
3,Horrible Smell But It Works!,"So I've been having some mouse issues and any surface I tried (that I already had) would not work. And since I don't own a single mouse pad, I found this to be a cheap option to start with. This is your standard and average mouse pad but hey, it works. I'm satisfied for now since my mouse now tracks nicely. No more getting stuck on screen and getting your games screwed up. Yay!This mouse pad does however have a horrible smell that transfers. Who wants to go wash their wrists every time they're done using the computer? Bleck.I would probably not buy this again if needed due to the smell."
1,"If you like toxic rubbery smells, you'll love this mouse pad.","I've had it now for maybe a couple months now and only recently have I been able to work without risking a headache. The release of fumes is actually so bad you don't just smell it in the air... you can smell it on the skin of your palm from having been using the mouse. It's not worth it. Some stuff you just have to buy in person. : / Lesson learned. Amazon doesn't have info on this sort of detail and I should have read the reviews before I bought it because other people mention it. I need to buy a new one, and I just don't get out often to buy random stuff like this so... But after two mouse pad purchase failures on amazon I need to just get in the car and end up spending a couple bucks more for what I want."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I like the texture and quality of this mouse pad. Not sure why the manufacturer overlooked the smell, it smells like a new tire. Overall, I recommend this product."
5,Great,"It's a mouse pad. Didn't expect much.. But it does exactly what its purpose is. Works great, so no problems"
2,Terrible smell,"The pad smells terrible and after you have been using it, the smell sticks to your hand. I read from another review that after a couple of weeks it goes away. So I'll give it a little more time. Its been a week. Otherwise the pad is great. But if the smell doesn't subside, I'll have to throw it away."
4,Good for the price,"This isn't the most exciting mouse pad in the world, but it gets the job done. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent mouse pad for a cheap price. I wish it had a wrist pad on it, but I'm not going to complain since this wasn't something I wanted to spend a lot on. Great for the occasional user or someone looking to not spend much on a mouse pad."
4,mouse pad,its a cheap pad..works well and is thick and comfortable...what else could you ask for?..and it doent smell bad like others have said...
1,Smelly Mouse Pad,Don't buy this Mouse Pad it smells SOOOO BAD like toxic rubber ewwww... I'm getting a freakin headache. I bet its toxic too... Yuck. I will never buy a belkin product ever again.
2,"Inexpensive, but not worth the money","I cheaped out and got this mouse pad because of all the high reviews. I should've spent an extra couple of dollars for a better mouse pad. It's really thick, doesn't glide well, is rather small, and has a terrible smell that sticks to your hands."
1,"Large size, but the smell is terrible.","I am a pretty flexible person, but honestly the smell of this product made it unusable at my office. I had to throw it away."
1,Doesn't work with my Logitech M215 mouse,"Well, this was a surprise. My previous mouse pad was a Belkin and it lasted me for years. Perhaps there's something weird about my optical mouse, but it simply won't work at all with this one. Unfortunately I can't recommend a specific brand since I just went over to the dollar store after giving up on this one and picked up a no-name brand. That one's fine. Strange that my mouse won't work with this Belkin."
2,Can't satnd the smell and bought a different one,"The smell really ruins my experience with computer. Sitting more than 8 hours around the smell is a disaster. I have ordered a different mouse pad the second day I bought this one. For those who put their health first, avoid this mouse pad (I don't even believe it can pass Belkin's quality control)."
1,Can't take the overwhelming smell!,The smell of rubber is so strong I can't even use it. I have never had this trouble with a mouse pad before. Too bad. I guess that is why it is so much cheaper that most. Now I have wasted my money and will have to buy a different one. Wish I had read the reviews!!
5,Great quality,I bought these for my students to use with the 18 new Macs. They appreciate the material covered foam and the generous size.
1,Typo Alert,Somehow the mousepad would have more credibility for me if they knew how to correctly spell the word greater in the product description. What has happened to our society is utterly shameful.
2,cheap but not good,It is cheap but not good. I am not using it any more but I didn't bother to return it either.
5,can't beat for the price,"You just can't beat this mousepad for the $2 price. Surface works with all varieties of mice - optical, regular, etc... Nice surface texture and thickness. Rubber backing grips desktop surface firmly."
5,No slipping or sliding!,"This Belkin 8x9 Mouse Pad is much better and a bit more thicker and heavy-duty than my previous mouse pad. Best of all it grips better and does not slip and slide around the plexiglass on my desk top like my previous mouse pad -- and my mouse even seems to be more responsive and have better control! I don't have a very large desk so this particular model and size fits my desk top perfectly.Other than not slipping or sliding and noticeably better mouse response/control, what else can one say about a mouse pad -- it does exactly what it was designed and intended to do do superbly!It is reasonably priced and well worth every dollar in my opinion, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good and functional mouse pad."
3,Decent mouse pad except for fading color,"This is a decent plain black rubbery mouse pad. Not too thick, not too thin. I docked stars because the black coloring fades over time where the mouse (or your wrist) rub against it, making it look ugly. Other than that, it's fine."
5,exactly what I expected,"This mouse pad was cheap, black, and works like a mouse pad should. I have no complaints with this product. Thanks you"
4,World's most boring mousepad,"This is a basic mousepad. It is nothing special. Even though I have optical and laser mice, I bought this mouse pad to keep from dirtying up my desk (dirt tends to accumulate on mouse feet). It's a cheap mousepad and looks the part. But who needs a fancy mousepad anyway?"
5,Mouse Pad,I bought a new keyboard and a new mouse.So of course I had to buy a new mouse pad.This pad is the perfect size for my new mouse.Looks great also.
2,Mouse pad,"This mouse pad surface and size are fine; however, the pad has a rubber smell that I hope will go away. After three weeks of use it still stinks."
5,Superior superiority,"This has got to be the most awesome mousepad ever!Super sleek and elegant black matte finish, woven nylon and polyurethane membrane, 8"" girth by 9"" length of optical tracking mayhem. I can play 3d tetris and majonng like I was flipping through porn. I'm not ambidextrous, but I can definitely switch to a left-hand mouse, which is vital for those late-night clickfests, if you catch my drift. I don't really know much else of what to say about this product. If you're looking for an uuber elite gaming mouse pad that doubles as a bad-mouthed girlfriend face-whip, look no further. You can definitely use this to slap the taste out of her naughty mouth. Buy one today, and be fapping it the hardest in a little less than a couple days."
2,Less Than Basic,"This is an extremely low quality mouse pad (even with the very low price). I expected it to be a little more substantial, perhaps at least a better finished edge. But instead it looks like someone used an exacto knife on a big piece of foam. The worst part was that it wreaks of a chemically rubber smell that is a bit offensive."
2,buy only if you only have few bucks left,"i have been using it for about a week. Not only it smells awful, but it also feels bad and warm on the pad. Bad for summer use. But, we get what we paid..."
3,"Decent basic mouse pad, but it smells terrible","This is very basic mouse pad. It's perfectly functional and has a good mousing surface. However, it positively reeks of rubber. It smells strongly enough that you notice it when sitting next to it at your work station, and it permeates your hand while using it. Expect your mousing hand to smell like cheap tires or, in my opinion, somewhat like old cigarette smoke after using it for any length of time. It is difficult to wash the odor away."
1,Horrible smell,"It really smells horrible. I tried to air it out, but it doesn't help at all. Plus, the smell transfers to your wrist if you're using it.Belkin seemed like a quality company that would not allow themselves to such a level of horrid quality."
1,It smells like old! :(,"This product functions just as described. It is rectangular and soft. My mouse glides across its surface as if the two were made for each other. In fact my mouse has never been happier.I on the other hand wish I had never let this thing into my household. As soon as I unwrapped it I was overcome by the stench of mothballs and an old lady's denture breath. Even after dousing it with Febreeze, I get punched in the face by its odor every time I sit down at my desk. This will be discarded as soon as I am done with this review. I am going to have to tell my mouse that his new mouse pad has gone to mouse pad heaven. He will be heartbroken."
3,It is what it is,"This is exactly what you think it is, a cheap mouse pad with no design on it. The picture Amazon has makes it look a little purple but it is black. 3 stars because it does smell terrible."
4,Simple and Effective,"No fancy bells or whistles here, just a nice simple mouse pad. Perfect for my step-father and his PC gaming. It came quickly and I was very pleased. Product was just as described."
3,Your standard mouse pad,"No frills, no fancy design.....just your standard mouse pad here. If your looking for a pad with no design, no wrist rest, etc. This is the mouse pad for you."
4,Good basic mousepad,"Big, comfortable, cheap mousepad that was prime eligable. Couldn't ask for more. Only downside is that is smells REALLY potent of rubber. Even after a week."
2,Terrible smell outweighs great price and decent mousepad,"Mousepad has a terrible smell like wet dog. Hoping that the smell goes away over time. Other mousepads are available for more money. This would be a perfectly adequate 5-star mousepad but for the wretched stench. If the smell doesn't go away, I'll have to throw it away and buy an alternative model."
2,Smells bad and misleading size,"Nice mouse pad but smells horrible. When you air the mouse pad out, it still smells bad. The size was off by about an inch."
2,It is OK for small place,"It sucks good,light weight and wheeling good,but after vacuming one room,I had to empty dust and cleans filter every time I use .It takes a few days to dry completely and I am tired of cleaning the filter.After a year and half,I forgot to put ther filter in,which has been drying,and the motor busted.The end."
3,Nice quiet light duty vacuum,"This is a quiet easy to use vacuum cleaner if you don't need a lot of suction. I bought it because I have a long haired dog and I got tired of clawing the dog hair out of the beater bar on the upright. Works well for me, although it's a bit labor intensive on a large area."
5,This Vacuum Rocks!,This is one of the best items I have ever purchased. I also purchased the Sanyo SC-X1000P Powerhead Canister vacuum at my local vac shop. That vacuum is like a rolls-royce at a Ford price... I wish Amazon carried it.
2,DIED under a year,"Well, what else can I say... it was great for hardwood floor, cleaning bird cages, but it died after 10 months. The thing just doesn't turn on anymore. What a disappointment. $70 device for 10 months, then out into the garbage can. Truly a useful device, if you can afford $70 every 10 months to replace it."
3,"Strong Suction, cheap attachments and hard-to-clean filter","I bought the Sanyo SC-270 last year and was initially very pleased with the strong suction and portability. After a short time I became dissappointed with how quickly the filter clogs and how messy it is to clean with the tools provided (hands in the filth). Also, the tubing and attachments are very 'cheap' and easily fall apart. Overall, I expected a bit more...though, when clean and fully functioning, the suction is excellent."
4,Sanyo Vacuum,"Although not the best I've ever owned, I'll say it does a great job for what we need it for. And in todays spiralling conditions, It fit the budgit."
4,Still Suckin',It Sucks! A small package that inhales it all. Cleans up easily with great attachments that I found very useful. The hose is stiff but will probably soften with use. A small powerful package!
2,Get the new edition,"I've won soldier of the quarter boards thanks, in a large part, to this book. But, the 9th edition will have all the updated FM numbers; which you are probably going to need to do well on SGT and SSG boards. Go to Banda books website and buy it there or if you are lucky enough to have a decent clothing sales store get the 9th edition there.To be honest though, this book makes the difference between getting a low 130s score and a high 140s score on your promotion board. The 9th edition is a MUST HAVE for the SPC and CPL looking to move up."
2,Braun KF510 - a disappointment,I have had a Braun coffeemaker for the last 20 years and loved the coffee. I have had the basic aromamaster model which they no longer make. It brewed great coffee. I am very disappointed with the updated version - the coffee is not nearly as good. It has much less flavor. I am not sure what the difference is in the brewing process - but the end product is far inferior.
2,"Carafe dribbles, plate burns","After owning a Braun FlavorSelect for a few years, I broke the carafe for the second time (other FlavorSelect owners understand this problem). Rather than seeking out another replacement carafe for an aging machine, I opted for a new coffee maker. I LOVE the Brita filter, so I opted for the AromaDeluxe. Big mistake. The carafe dribbles everywhere and the warming plate is way too hot, burning the coffee. We're working around the problem by transferring the coffee to a thermal carafe when it's done (and wiping up lots of spills). If you have a FlavorSelect, keep buying new carafes until the machine dies. The AromaDeluxe is a significant downgrade in coffee making."
2,Not so good,"This coffeemaker has so much potential, but makes rather watery coffee. It looks better than most coffeemakers out there and has fewer bells and whistles that tend to break with use anyway, and after reading the reviews I thought it would be good for my purposes- but not so. The plastic is made of inferior quality compared to my old Salton and I'm just hoping that I won't have to repurchase next year, but I've seen this kind of flimsy plastic in other products that break too easily or don't hold up to higher temperatures. When the coffee is brewing dribbles appear at the bottom joint where the swing basket sits and they drip down the side. This has never happened before in all the years I've been making coffee. To top it off, the coffee is really weak and I'm not a strong coffee freak but I have to use twice as much coffee as I used to to get the same strength brew. I had higher hopes for this one- too bad."
4,Very Pleased.......,"Our faithful 10 cup Braun Aromaster finally died and unfortunately theyaren't produced anymore. Knew we wanted another Braun, so this was the logical choice for a replacement. Don't need the auto features and clockso this fits the bill just fine.Not thrilled with the expensive water filter, not sure if I'll purchasea replacement. We have filters inline with our drinking water so itseems redundant. Though this unit does make a great cup of coffee.These Braun's are so well made and it really shows that they put allot of thought into their design. Very pleased, go ahead and buy one."
4,good coffeee,this is as very good coffee maker the decanter is a little awkward whjen pouring but it makes good coffee
3,Dribbles,"Bought this maker in 2007 to replace Mr. Coffee, which made my coffee taste bad. This Braun has one flaw I've found: it dribbles. For those of us eager to get to that first mug of the day, if you try to over pour the spout, this pot will dribble down the side. Pouring must be a patience-learning activity for this pot. But it makes good coffee."
1,Braun Coffee Maker,Purchased on May 3rd and it's now in the shop being repaired. The clip that holds the cover shut broke and I had to send it to a repair shop to be be replaced. I had to send it to Bay Shore N.Y. 11706 to get the work done.
2,This was not the DVD I thought I ordered. I thought it had Dem Bones on it with a wonderful explanation of the human skeleton.,"This was not the DVD I thought I had ordered. I thought it had Dem Bones on it, a wonderful teaching tool on the human skeleton. I didn't like these renditions of the stories. As a music specialist, I expect higher quality then this from Scholastic."
3,The first song is awesome but the rest so so,"I love the Wheels of the Bus version on this DVD. Much smoother and classier than the YouTube ones, but my only drawback is that the rest of the 6 songs (up to 7 total) are as follows: 4 read stories with musical background and 2 songs like the Wheels of the Bus (which is really what I was expecting).With this being said, not really worth the $12.81 that I paid but my 18 month old loves the Wheels of the bus..."
5,Perfect product - Perfect transaction!!!,Amazon offers lots of options and is easy to navigate. Amazon is a great option when I need an item quickly and don't have time to drive around and shop! Saves me a boatload on gas!!!
5,Excellent read,"I received this book as a gift some years ago. I am a jazz fan (wannabe trad jazz banjo player), also classical, Americana, et al.; anything that is played with skill, intelligence and passion. This book is very well written and provides insight into the amazing lives of two of our many unheralded jazz virtuosos. I have read it more than once and taken their lessons on life and music to heart the best that my abilities allow. A very good read for anyone with a strong interest in the history of jazz and more broadly in music and life."
3,Too General to be Useful for Me.,"I want to become a first grade teacher in the San Francisco area, and this book didn't give me much information specifically about how the credentialing process works. I wanted to know about the tests and specifically what I have to do to get into a credentialing program. This book is full of general information and statistics, but wasn't exactly what I was looking for. As another reviewer said, it does seem a bit thin when you get it, but the text is small and there's lots of information in it. It is nicely designed and has many pictures and anecdotes, but it was too general for me. This book might be helpful if you really don't know if you want to be a teacher, or if you want to learn about careers in teaching. I also bought ""Earn Your California Teaching Credential: K-6"", which was exactly what I was looking for. It's a lot more specific about the credentialing, testing, and hiring processes (and it's less expensive)."
4,The New Braindance Release,"Fans of ""the Braindance coincidence"" will feel at home here, for the same cheery melodies and playful rythms can be seen on this second compilation from rephlex. First time listeners may be a little uneasy at some of the harsher sounds and muddled beats, but at the end of the day with 19 tracks there is something to please everybody. Being a huge IDM fan I love the album, new tracks from D'archangelo, Bogdan and AFX himself a real bargain for 11."
2,not a very good job,"There are a few good photos of chicken pox blisters in here, but not very much information for children about the disease. The book has a feeling of being quickly slapped together. Pages of children at the beach or roller blading are just filler. This book lacks a cohesive narrative. There is better on the market."
2,I like whispering girls.,"The idea of the girls' whispering in the background is a tremendously alluring concept. But here they do not so much whisper as talk ""softly"", and not always very softly, either--especially the one who sounds like a man. I had to grab for the voice credits, verifying (by traditional name standards, at least), that both ""whisperers"" were women. At least this has the right Idea. I am sick, and even tired, of ""relaxation/meditation/hypnosis/guided visualization"" being dominated by male voices. If I want to be told to relax, I want a woman doing the telling. Not for sexual reasons, mind you (not that there's anything at all wrong with that...)--but perhaps mostly for the inner little boy cradled deep in my subconscious, cut apart from The Mother Voice, never to be so nurtured again. Having a dorky guy voice tell me to ""relax..."" or ""feel loved..."" borders, no, it flatly trepspasses on creepy territory."
4,Great book!,"If you watched the movie, you will love the book more. It gets racy in parts. Mostly where it's a random place to have racy verbiage but overall the book was great!"
5,Long live the Clampetts!,"For anyone who is a fan of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" (or is interested in TV history) this is the book for you! Steve Cox has a way of writing that makes you feel as if he is in your own living room telling you the remarkable story of the Clampetts. The book contains: fantastic black & white and color photos, behind the scenes stories, great interviews with the cast, an episode guide and a detailed history of America's favorite hillbilly family. So set a spell with Steve Cox as your guide and relive all the fun and laughter of The Beverly Hillbillies. Y'all read up now y'hear."
2,Sound is horrible....,"I used to listen to this album for years, this CD obviously hasnt been remastered, should have been, stiil alot of great songs but the sound could have been better. oh well."
5,One of the Great All Time Groups!,The Rascals to me are a classic. Felix Cavalieri and the boys can really make rock - rock. All time favorite group.
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this because I am an Alan Menken fan. So I was really disappointed to discover that there appear to be no new Alan Menken songs on this album, only some incidental music. The songs are by other artists, and are ok - but they do not have Alan Menken's unique talent. A real disappointment."
4,Vaguely remembered dream scapes,"I only vaguely remember this book, from reading it just after it had come out. Yet to meet anyone who has read it who wasn't intrigued. The book has a fascinating, dream-like quality, and only a weak, confusing ending mars a superbly written ""good-and-evil"" YA novel."
3,a good cd.,"sorry gang, i don't think this is a perfect cd. not by any means. it does emphasize the soul music side of eric, rather than blues. personally, ""my secret life"" is eric's more recent best. i'm not too sure why a song like ""kingsize jones"" was even released by the band as it is extremely sophomoric. if you like soul music, i guess this is an okay cd. i think burdon's strong point has always been his singing the blues. and with that, check out his other cds."
2,Not pleased...,I am a huge Eric Burdon fan. I bought this one on the advice of others who rated it. They were wrong. This sucks! Not worth buying.
2,Who woulda thought?,"Eric Burdon was a pioneer of raw, powerful music. I don't know how this album can be held to compare with his earlier work (The Animals, etc.). This album is the epitomy of bland, standard-fare, color-by-numbers blues. How disappointing."
4,ERIC BURDON moves on and creates a new sound,"I have loved the sound of ERIC BURDONS voice since I heard House of the Rising Sun....I have everything commercially released by the Animals....before during and after...and a few live ""special releases""....HE IS BACK...and its all good and different. He is blues, he is a poet, he is deep and this is a departure for him...a brave move. I like it and everytime I listen, it gets more interesting."
4,It's All About the Voice,"When you listen to an Eric Burden album, it is not about the music or the instruments it is about his rich and distinctive baritone voice. This is the case of Soul of a Man. Good songs, good musical delivery, nicely produced, but these would not go anywhere without Eric Burden.Very good album and easy to listen to."
4,For the Blues Fans.....Yes!!,"If your looking for an Animals reincarnation and something in the 60's Pop rock stylings you might steer away. But, if you enjoy good blues, growling stuff, as only E Burdon can deliver it, then this one is a gem. A worthy addition to any blues collection! 4 stars for blues (Avid Burdon fans will probably give it 5.)"
4,A must have for Eric Burdon fans............,"Best complete album I've heard from Eric since the ""Animals"". His voice & writing are amazing."
4,Great New Album,"Good songs, good band, and great vocals. The best album of his solo career, and right up there with the best of the Animal's recording's."
5,Burdon's Back Again,"Eric Burdon continues to reinvent himself. Just when you think all he had left was singing the oldies, he has again become relevent. There are few live performers that can match Eric's stage presence, however for the most part his albums especially anything in the last twenty years have not matched his talent. Soul of Man along with the previously released My secret Life, clearly show Eric still has a lot to contribute.The More you listen, the more you become hooked. Soul of man delivers on all levels. It well produced, great songs, great band & most importantly great performance from Eric. Enjoy this album, because there are few performers if any that can deliver the way Eric does. Hopefully he may get some credit."
3,"It works, but...","I was attracted to this product because it was a soy-free product, and I'm allergic to soy. I was concerned that the constipation issues I had had with other protein shakes were caused by the soy allergy. I bought the vanilla flavor. I mixed the product with 1% milk. It didn't taste good at all. I didn't mind the grainy-ness, and expected that from the reviews I had read. I found adding a couple of tablespoons of splenda to it made it quite nice. Perhaps I just have an overactive sweet tooth, but the splenda helped tremendously. My concern with this product was the severe gas it gave me. I have never been lactose intolerant, or had any issues with dairy in the past but I do understand the issue could be caused by this particular form of lactose/lactase. I will need to try beano, or if that doesn't work, maybe ginger root capsules in order to use the remainder of this product."
4,Okay sublinguals,"These are ok B12's. A little slow to dissolve, but not bad, especially for the price. Has a mild taste, which I like."
4,The Movie A Must,"If it's Jeff Tweedy you know it's good. This soundtrack may not be what you're expecting on first listen. You'll appreciated the soundtrack much more if you see ""Chelsea Walls"". I also suggest you watch it twice. Be patient, give both a chance. It's well worth it. Oh yeah,and Robert Sean Leonard, let's hope to see and hear more of him."
3,Worth the cost just for...,"""when the Roses bloom again"" a 5 star song if there was ever one - The rest of the CD is average by that song is GREAT"
5,A favorite toy!,"My 2-year old son has loved this toy from day one. I like that it can take 1 shape and turn it different directions on the same puzzle. You can ""see the wheels turning"" while my son works on this. Every child that comes to visit loves this toy as well. It's a must-have and a great gift idea."
5,Block puzzle,Excellent puzzle for child almost two. Bright colors and interesting shapes. Lots of variety in a wooden box.
3,Not the quality I have come to expect from Melissa and Doug,"I love the bright colors and the wood construction. However, upon opening the plastic for the first time, the paint is flaking! I would expect this from a well used product, not a brand new one!"
3,My son lost interest pretty quickly..,"I bought this set for my then 23 months old son. He could do it pretty easily as he'd been learning about shapes; he pretty much played with it three times and never wanted to play with it again, so far...He's now 2 and a half and he's already lost interest in this set. I was hoping he could use it a lot longer..."
2,Way too easy,"My 20 month old put these puzzles together 6 times and has never looked at them again. I liked the idea that the puzzles had two sides, and the awesome quality of the product. It just wasn't a good investment for me."
5,A surprising hit!,"I ordered this for my soon-to-turn 2 yo granddaughter, because she was learning her shapes already, and I had a lot of faith in it just b/c it was a Melissa & Doug product. It arrived, and I wasn't at all sure that she would like it all that much...it seemed kind of boring to me. Well, it turns out she absolutely loves it!!! I guess she's just at that ""puzzle stage"", and she really does tune into shapes and what they're called. She's even figured out that two squares will fill the spaces meant for rectangles. This was a hit!! She will play with it for an hour or longer at a time! I really can't say that I expect her to stay as fascinated with it for much longer, but it would be a great toy to help teach shapes!"
5,Best toys ever - can they be made with a lid (please?),"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this company's products. They are durable, colorful, well designed, and boutique quality.My only minor complaint .. could they maybe make these with a lid to contain the pieces (like those tiny letters) in the box? I immediately sealed this item in a large zip-loc when I got it .. but a slide-on lid would make it even better!!!"
4,Short Longevity,"We loved this set. It is great for very young kids and they like it. However, the time between learning the principle and getting bored because it became too easy, was very short.About 2 months ago we bought Snappers by Toysie - a pattern block puzzle. My children (with 3 years apart!) both still play with it.It seems like my youngest child will be using it for the next 3 years. That is the lifespan for a toy!"
3,creative way to learn shapes,"My three years old son knows the names of the basic shapes--circle, triangle, square, oval, rectangle. However, he has difficulty in saying them out loud. This puzzle encourages/prompts him to name each shape as he place it in. The pieces are very colorful and sturdy. The wooden encasement keeps everything tidy. My son got tired of this puzzle within a few days. I would not recommend you buy this unless you're planning to pass it on."
4,"Kids love the toy, I HATE it","Melissa and Doug, why oh why oh WHY can't you put lids on things? The pieces are FOREVER getting separated. I find the pieces EVERYWHERE but with the puzzle. The size is great and should be a good choice to bring with in the car or on vacation. Unfortunately, like ALL of your toys, IT HAS AN OPEN TOP! How are kids supposed to travel with it if there is no way to keep things contained? I wish I could put this review on all of your toys, but unfortunately it would take too long because, as I said, they ALL have open tops."
5,Very educational!,"This toy is great! Not only is it toy but a great learning tool ! My two year old loves this! Spending a lot of time with it ,"
4,Great Toy,My 4 years old son love this game it's so cool he enjoyed playing it a lot and as well as my nephews.
4,Grandson - 3 years,"Good choice for 3 year old grandson who is interested in drawing, patterns, sorting. As usual Melissa and Dougar first class toys. Wish this one had a cover so shapes would not fall out."
4,Too easy for my two year old,"My 2.2 year old daughter likes puzzles. These are much to easy for her. She can finish six piece jigsaws on her own and all peg puzzles are easy her for her to finish in a few seconds, if that helps guage whether this is the appropriate level for your child. She does like it a lot, however, even though it isn't challenging. It is a good bed-time puzzle.Technically, it is very well made and aesthetically pleasing, with very nice colors and puzzle shapes."
1,bad quality,"I am very dissatisfied with the paint quality of the product. It looks like the paint did not dry out before the pieces were put together so once separated the paint simply peeled off. For the price, one could expect a better quality."
3,Just ok,"I got this as a gift for my three year old. He's played with it maybe twice since Christmas and always at my suggestion. It's just too easy for him. Maybe if we'd had it when he was one or two years old, it would have been more successful."
2,More like puzzles,My only complaint was that it's just too basic. It's more of a collection of puzzles instead of geometric patterns. Some of the puzzles only use 3 pieces and are barely connected. I felt it was way too easy for my 2 year old.
5,Great Fun and Educational Toys,"I have several Melissa and Doug toys; several were purchased for Christmas for my 2 yr old daughter. She loves puzzles and is having a lot of fun with all of them. The pattern blocks is just the right level; it takes a little challenge to get the triangles the right way in the puzzle, but she can accomplish everything by herself. It's a toy we can play with together and it's easy clean up. I love the sturdiness of the various puzzles I have purchased through this company; it's nice to have something that isn't going to break after it has been used a few times."
5,"Great pictures, great tasting and fun to cook with your kids!","I bought this after running out of ideas to feed our vegetarian family that would also be interesting for our 3 year old. The best thing about this book is the pictures of the complete dish as well as the ingredients needed at the recipe side so that even children who are not reading yet (like ours) can still get excited and help out with the first step of hunting down all the ingredients needed.Despite being vegetarian, the recipes are not overly hippy - you can get all of the ingredients at any supermarket and they actually include ingredients like butter, milk, cheese and salt. The finished dishes all taste great- also a hit at potlucks!We also like the kid recipe projects like making a bread house or animal shaped breadsticks, a fun activity you can do with your kids and then be able to enjoy eating too!The hardcover book also keeps nicer than paperbacks being around wet and messy ingredients."
5,brilliant and scathing and right,"one doesn't want to admit it, but trow is dead-on in this book. these aren't observations that are new in any way, but they are presented in brilliant, crystaline prose that one can't exscape or deny."
1,Hate it with all my guts,"Some people are born writers; others, natural stylists. Some people come into the world with the enviable ability to philosophize; others are blessed with a no less enviable gift to think through an idea logically and clearly. Which puts G. W. S. Trow in an awkward position: for though he could not write well, he yet fancies himself a great stylist; and though his critical thinking is at best muddle-headed and derivative, he yet imagines himself an oracular critic of the sharpest distinction. Reading this re-publication of Trow's throw-away essay instantly brought to mind that immortal phrase Dwight Macdonald used to lampoon Jimmy Gould Cozzens's prose style: malphony exfoliates."
3,"Average underwear, above average price","I wouldn't have normally purchased these if they hadn't been part of a great underwear sale Amazon was having. In the past, 2(x)ist has catered to more of a gay clientele, but word on the street is that it is seeking to bust out of that particular niche into a broader market. If that's the case, they need to up the *wow* factor or drop the price.It's not that I didn't like the underwear -- they are a pretty sexy pair that came in a really nice royal blue, but with a normal price tag of $22, I thought they wouldn't bunch or constrict -- after a few wearings, I can't confidently claim that they're ""wedgie-free.""I have read other 2(x)ist reviews, and have heard generally good things (especially about their soy underwear, which is apparently VERY comfortable), but I didn't really feel that these were anything too special except for the name."
3,Fits and functional but whistles,"Bought this for a 97 Civic and it went on easily and fits well except for the front corner. It's a bit rounded while the cutout is more angled. Not a huge deal and it doesn't affect the functionality, but it does whistle (not super loudly) on occasion."
4,"Current and accurate information, overpriced",Great book. Covers all the areas of online marketing. Very current (1999) but overpriced. I did not purchase it as a textbook so I may not see all the value in the work. It is not about getting your web site on search sites but how to market it as a brand etc. Five stars for content less one for high price. Dan
5,Sit back and cruise OR stand up and dance!,"This album is timeless. Not being able to articulate nearly as well as the previous reviewers, I can only add that this music feels like love...butterflies in your stomach, smile on your face, energized & peaceful at the same time. I've been listening to it (as well as the first two releases purchased from their website) for several years and the experience is still as fresh and FUN as the first time I heard them. The only way to improve on the experience is to see them perform live which I HIGHLY recommend also."
5,Must Have Music,"INDISPENSIBLE.A must have for any music afficionado.This band, whom I have seen twice, has stellar skills. Their arrangements and performances are: groovy, classy, upbeat, songs ranging from jazz/funky jam, reggae/dub, latinesque, zydecko, and salsa/mambo......Also recommend their live show, (vinylgroove.com) for more.thanks: tony, doug, alexis, danny, billy, john, and geoff!I really needed that!tjw"
5,Very very good indeed,Bloody good stuff. So true.One line that stuck in my mind. In 3rd world countries there's often a desperation in peoples faces whereas in provincial England there's a gormlessness. Describing the Vauxhall nova boys tearing up the neighborhood. Some great lines.LOL funny book.
2,A little American bashing is very funny. Every chapter is not.,"I am a huge fan of Clarkson, and I greatly enjoy old and new Top Gear. I loved his Motorworld program. I enjoyed the excerpts of his books. But now, having purchased the full version, I am sick of it. Nearly ever chapter centers around fat, slothful Americans. A reference here and there is funny, but this is just over the top. I don't think I will buy another."
1,Zzzzz...,"It's mostly ranting -- lots and lots of it. After the 3rd chapter, I got really bored and decided it just wasn't my cup of tea. Fortunately, I was able to get my money back from Amazon."
4,"Entertaining stuff, good for toilet reading","This isn't so much a laugh out loud funny book but more the kind where you can appreciate some of his silly, OTT views. Clarkson has a gift for phrases and while a lot of it is sneering, it is enjoyable sneering from someone who doesn't take himself too seriously.This is best delved into while having a meditative dump.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Quite Good,This book was before the new TOP GEAR show. The new book 'Round the Bend' is a much more interesting read. This one doesn't even mention cars which makes it a little boring.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Reading this volume by Jeremy Clarkson reminded me very much of another book of the same genre I had read some years back, namely Stephen Clarkes's ""Year In The Merde"", which I hated. It was supposed to be funny and entertaining but I found it frivolous and annoying, chock full of hyperbole and clever sentences and no content. It might be fun to read Clarkson's weekly Sunday Times column now and then but to actually go out and buy an entire compilation of his articles and read them back to back is something to avoid.I must be missing something cos nearly everybody else seems to be enjoying his books but I'm putting out this warning to the small minority of readers who don't - like me perhaps - get it."
3,Allright but great for Brits,"Its a ""book"" of short leads hes written for the papers. Some of it is general and somewhat funny, but a lot of it is only relevant in a comedic sense for the brits themselves. Its an ok read but I regret not using the money on something else."
5,Absolutely hilarious,"This is a really really laugh-out-loud funny book written by the man, the legend....Jeremy Clarkson.It's a good time to read"
4,A Quick One,Quite an amusing book.Jeremy Clarkson has a gift with words as well as being an ace driver.He has a quirky sense of humour.
4,the world according to...,Very funny but rambled at times. Very easy to relate to and understand. No real story line just a lot of thoughts from Clarkson very entertaining.
5,The best book...in the world...,"If you're a fan of Top Gear , you must get this book. Jeremy Clarkson's dry wit will have you rolling with laughter. I bought this as a gift for my husband an he couldn't put it down. It's that good!"
3,smaller case than expected,"nice looking, but 39mm case resembles a womans watch, def needs to be bigger. Second hand was a little off the tic marks."
4,Present,This present brought full approval by my 50something year old husband. Will see how it holds up to his demands. :)
5,Quality watch,"I'm very pleased with this watch. It is just the right size and looks fashionable and masculine. The glow in the dark hands make it easy to tell time in the dark. The clasp on the band is a little stiff to open but other than that, a very good watch for the price."
4,invicta,"Like the watch had a self winding model and decided to get a battery operated clone. This watch is smaller, my fault for not checking the size. It is a nice watch. Please take the time to check specs or you can be surprised."
5,"Great watch, great price!","Bought this watch for my father in law and then my husband because he liked his dad's so much. It is a nice, inexpensive good quality watch. My husband has a Breitling he wears to work, and changes it out for this to kick around in."
5,So far so good!,"For the money, you can't beat this product. I've had for about half a year, and have taken hundreds of photos. I've yet to lose a single photo (knock on wood). Would definitely recommend.PS. I can't really comment on speed as I use a DSLR. I can tell you that it's certainly not slowing me down."
5,Butterfly Gardening for the South,"Beautiful book with terrific color photography. For quick reference, there are descriptive charts listing food and nectar plants with perspective butterflies and/or larvae. The appendices is filled with useful information such as how to photograph butterflies, seed and plant sources, and more. An illuminating book for reading and learning."
4,Not bad for novices,"A good resource that covers everything from Facilitation to Techniques passing through evaluation and personal development. If you are a beginner or you are asked frequently to help other beginner-level trainers, then you would probably benefit from this book.The Book is written in an easy and simple style that takes the reader through the different aspects of training logically and smoothly."
3,"Solid, If Dry, Guide for the First Time Trainer","This is a reasonable summary of current techniques and strategies for training. The writing is a bit dry, and I got the feeling that this book was oriented towards human resources professionals. There is nothing wrong with that, but my preference is for a less academic style of writing. Still, it's not a bad choice, just not one of my favorites."
2,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"I bought this book because my company asked me to conduct some sales training courses. Although I knew what the content should be, I needed help in structuring the training, making it compelling and keeping the audience involved. What I was looking for were some basic outlines for a training class as well as some ideas of group exercises, team builders, etc. This book did not provide any of that. I ended up turning to an old training binders I had received from my previous classes I attended and tried to follow their pattern."
4,A nice album to chill or groove 2.,"I like this cd. All of the songs on here were good but there are 2 of them, which are my favorite:""Basement Journey S"" and ""Wasted"". ""Wasted"" was the reason why I got this album. That's a sad song. But overall, I liked this one."
4,Silver ivy,"The rings were fun and exactly as pictured. They do tend to catch on things, but for the price and the enjoyment we got out of them, they were great. Arrived quickly and in perfect shape."
2,To soft and cumbersome,This ring looks gorgeous but because it sticks up it gets caught on everything. It is not worth the problems of wearing it. If you are someone who doesn't do anything or doesn't have to reach into a pocket book for anything you will be fine. Like I said looks great but cumbersome to wear.
4,Pretty,"This is such a nice little ring that can be worn for any occasion. It's adjustable, but it's very sturdy. I love it!"
5,Perfect fit,Original equipment so fit was great. It arrived very fast and order was as ordered Had no problems or issues.
4,good belt,This belt rarely slips and seems to last a long time. I would purchase the item again and I like to keep at least one on hand.
5,Exactly as described,"Exactly as described, and fast shipping (for me, at least). This was genuine Kirby, and a much better price than from Kirby."
2,ehhh,"It's a Kirby product, overpriced and proprietary. they force you to buy thier brand and allow no one else to compete."
5,Beautiful glasses,"These arrived quickly and in perfect condition. They feel good in the hand, make a nice ring when toasted, and are very sturdy."
5,A Really Fine $5 glass,"These are just the thing for our favorite $10+ tipple, Saint-Hilaire Blanquette de Limoux , to which they add just the right amount of elegance.I find the form just right; I've allways found the usual flute looks like a 1/2 starved runway cloths horse. You will need special care washing their interiors due to the narrow mouth, but at $5per that's probably automatic.Do note, however, that they stand about 10 inches tall! Befor you 'click-to-buy' I'd suggest you grab a ruler to remind yourself just how tall that really is."
4,Beautiful fragile glasses,I bought twelve of these and one came in cracked. Lost one on first use. I love the glasses but they are very fragile. I am buying another 6 to keep my inventory above twelve but expect to lose a glass or so more often that I would prefer. I bought two sets of the wine glasses and the entire box came in broken not once but twice so I gave up. Buy these only if you are very delicate with the drinking of champagne.
5,Finally a sub game that [isn't bad]!,"I love naval games, but sub games have traditionally been very slow and boring to me. I was very pleased to find this game to be extremly fast paced and exciting. The sub controls are more like a FPS than a sim type game, not too complicated. Great graphics, tons of action and stuff to blow up make this game one of my current favs."
1,"Dive Dive Dive,Take her to periscope depth","I have had this game for a couple years,it's fun to play,I have always been interested in submarines.My only complaint is I am unable to save my game progress,I always have to start from the beginning,once I got to a poiny where there was some type pf fortress with some huge cannon,and could progress no farther.There is absolutely no support for this game,so if you have problems like unable to save games,you can do what I did,uninstall the game and toss it in the garbage,thats where my Steel Tide ended up after 2 years.All that effort wasted gets old after a while."
4,A Must,This easy soft sheet is a must for all toaster ovens. Saves cleaning the bottom everyday by opening up the bottom.Just take out the sheet and clean at the sink.
4,serves its purpose,I made it fit better by cutting the corners. I cut them at the corner point in so they ends overlap. Otherwise the piece would not lay flat. This piece is extending the life of my toaster/oven.
4,nonstick toaster liner,"nonstick toaster liner works well, fits well and saves constant cleaning of bottom of toaster oven...amen"
1,?Toxic? - Ouch!,"Some of the advantages listed, for this product include: ""eliminating leftover mess reduces the risk of inflammation, pests, and burnt food odors"".... I love the concept!But....... The ""cure"" might pose the greater risk as a result of bits of fiberglass ""dust"" and the toxic fumes from the non-stick coating entering your body thru the food that you eat.If you just love this product, and don't want to give it up, consider replacing it often. The 'older' the product, the more 'stuff' it leaves behind.... in you food. (In case you are wondering, no, I am not affiliated w/ this company and trying to sell the product. I just care about 'you' being poisoned because you didn't know something and would want someone to share important info w/ me, if they had it, and I didn't.)"
1,Fire hazard - Unsafe product,"I bought this product for my Mother last month after she saw one at her friend's home. In the beginning, she was very pleased with it. However, she was baking an apple pie yesterday at 375 degrees and a small amount of filling dripped on the liner and burned a hole completely through it. The entire liner then started to smoke and curled up and warped over a large area around where the pie filling dripped. Once the liner cooled and cleaned up, it's now cracking and falling apart. Seems like a poor quality product and dangerous as well. Especially if at risk to catch on fire."
1,"Nice concept, but doesn't measure up...","I was really excited to get the aluminum foil out of the bottom of my oven when I found this product, however, it didn't last very long.After less than two months use in my gas oven, this liner turned white and brittle because the non-stick surface had baked off! I have never baked above 425 degrees, so the claims that it will withstand 550 degrees are outlandish. Don't waste your money!"
2,not what it shows in the picture,"As you can see in the photo, this matt is shown being placed on the bottom of your oven to catch spills but when you read the directions that come with the product, it states to place it on the bottom rack and not directly on the bottom of the oven."
2,Where Do You Put It?,"I thought this would be a nifty little item since I just bought a new toaster-oven, and wanted to keep it ""New"" looking. However, the packaging for this item does not tell you in what part of the oven to place it. I was told not to put it close to the heat source... which rules out the crumb catcher on the bottom. Yet that is the only place that it makes sense. So, if it came with some directions or suggestions as to how to use it, this might be a worth-while purchase."
1,Poor Product,"Worse than worthless, first time used and the coating melted marring the finish on my new Kenmore Elite wall oven. I was baking calzones @ 450F and 20 minutes into the process I noticed the oven beginning to smoke. Removed the liner and found the coating had melted off a portion of the liner. This particular oven has concealed heating elements, the liner did not come in contact with anything other than the bottom of the oven."
1,Too small!,I was very disappointed to see that the liner is considerably smallerthan the bottom of my toaster oven - and even more disappointed thatAmazon recommended this very liner for my Breville. It is quite uselesssince the crumbs/debris collect all around the ample space NOT coveredby the liner. Really? For such a small oven? And the price for the next sizeup is jacked up!
2,Not as expected,The liner is a little to small and a bit flimsy. I haven't had any problems with it burning or discoloring and I use my convection bake setting quite often. Cleans easily enough but I wouldn't recommend it.
5,The Best We've Seen,"Our toaster oven liner is fantastic -- easy to remove, clean, and return the the tray. It runs circles around our previous aluminum foil sheet method."
3,Packaging was entertaining,"I've spent the same amount on a movie ticket and been less entertained by the movie than I was by the instructions on the package of this liner. Seriously, if you don't mind tossing a few bucks away on a mediocre liner (as others have said, it's non-reflective and generally a poor fit), this is the most well-packaged mediocre liner available. I'll still use foil some of the time, but everytime I reach for this liner, I crack up, just thinking of the instructions."
1,not safe,"When this was in the oven at 400 deg. it smelled like there was a gas leak in my oven. (and I have an electric oven!!) I kept thinking the smell would ""burn off"", but it never did. It was too much. I certainly did not want that chemical smell in my food. I would not recommend this liner to anyone."
3,"works, but read the fine print first...","Unfortunately the toaster oven I purchased (hamilton beach) strongly recommend not putting any foil, or other liner at the base of the oven or it will cause overheating."
4,Toaster Oven Liner,"While I like the oven liner, it is too small for toaster oven we purchased. Size of liner should be shown in description."
3,liner for toaster overn,"This stains , I can not get it clean. I think that tinfoil works just as good The price is right."
4,it's an oven liner!,it does what it's supposed to do. Keeps the bottom of the oven clean. Glad I bought it. That's all.
3,small,"I LIKE THE LINER, BUT IT ONLY FITS ON 2/3 OF THE BOTTOM. THEY SHOULD MAKE IT, SO IF YOUR BOTTOM IS BIGGER, YOU COULD CUT IT TO FIT."
3,Toaster oven liner,The toaster oven liner works OK I guess but it is too small really for the oven I bought it for. Nothing sticks to it and it is easy to clean. Would I get another one? I don't know. The oven is not that hard to clean. The foil like I used to use doesn't have to be cleaned just thrown away. But for a no stick liner it is good one.
3,It's toast...,"I have a full-size liner in my over, but have to keep it on one of the oven racks rather than in the bottom. It does a good job catching drips and helping to keep the oven clean. So when I saw one sized for a toaster oven, I bought it. I have two problems with this liner. The first is that it doesn't fit my toaster oven. The second (a HUGE problem according to my husband) is that it isn't as reflective as the bottom of the toaster oven so that toast comes out much darker on the top than on the bottom. The main reason I purchased a new toaster oven is because out old one was giving us very uneven results. The new one worked great until we put the liner in. (And took it back out within a couple of days.) I would use this product if I were baking something messy or top-browning something that might drip, but it doesn't work for us for day-to-day use."
2,Makes Life Easier...but...,"This liner is just too SMALL for most toaster ovens..the product is as stated and wipes clean, but only covers a small area in the middle of the oven. Very SLOW delivery!"
1,A Warning for anyone that has birds,"If you set your toaster oven over 375 degrees, the fumes could kill your bird. I lost my Macaw to an oven liner after setting the oven to 450."
1,Ruined the appearance of my brand new oven. Not happy!,I agree... Liner adhered to the bottom of my oven and has now permanently adhered. Terrible product - waste of money and a scared oven to boot.
2,Good while it lasted,"Purchased this oven liner about 3 months ago. I just had to trash it because the non stick finish burned right off. Oven temp never exceeded 500 deg F. usually operating at 400 deg F. or less.In short, an inferior product, not worth the money. I will look for something better.I have a MIU silicone liner in the bottom of my convection toaster oven for over a year. No problems at all."
1,BE VERY CAREFUL,I used this seemingly incredible product and accidentally left it in the oven during a self-cleaning. It completely evaporated and left teflon covering the entire interior of the oven. I had to replace the oven! It was toxic from the teflon powder. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
4,Toaster Oven,"Great product for the price. Works well. More features would have provided 5 stars, but it is perfectly fine at this price point."
3,Returned the item,This really was a foolish purchase. I returned it when I saw what I spent $7.99 for.
2,melted after the second use,"it fit pretty good. a little smaller than the opening. but that's not the problem.the bottom element is around 3/16"" from the liner. maybe that's why it melted. who knows..but there is now a 2"" hole in the liner.at least it was cheap."
2,Not very useful,"The oven liner instructions warn that the oven liner should not be used directly on the heat element. After using the liner for one week a hole was burned through it without contacting the element. The liner is also not supposed to be used above 550 degrees or folded. I have only used it in toasting mode. However, it arrived folded in a small box. Reardless, it seems like the material ought to be heat resistant.---Fortunately, it was relatively inexpensive & I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,to small,Even though the picture looks like it fits It's about an inch too small all around the edges. there was several weeks delay in delivery and they did not notify me that it was backordered until I complained8
1,Do Not Buy This,It smells. When it get hot it smells. The food in the oven picks up the smell. If you don't want the off-gasing of teflon why use this. It smells.
4,Saves time! really pleased.,Does what it is suppose to do. Fits my toaster oven just right. Saves clean-up of my oven and it cleans easily.
3,What's the point?,It does its job but no way would i put anything in my toaster oven that requires the oven to be protected from dripping - cleaning the wire rack is a huge pain in the rear.
1,horrible WASTE OF MONEY,This product MELTED in my toaster oven & RUINED my brand new toaster oven. I wish I had never bought it.
2,Ma;ybe Not the Right Guy for the Job,"No question Vengerov is a superb virtuoso violinist, but his interpretations of Mozart's lovely concertos seem to find him ill at ease or at least uncertain about how to proceed with the material. He just never seems to get quite comfortable, as is evident in the slow movements where his playing of the beautiful melodies never come close to acquiring the required sense of grace and elegance that they should possess. For a performer who so magically mastered the complexities of Shostakovich and Prokofiev, Vengerov has yet to resolve a set of very different challenges in Mozart's far less technically demanding concertos. Great sounding CD, though."
1,Genius on the wrong track... again,"A true enigma, Vengerov. In person one of the most extraordinary fiddlers I've heard. Yet, his recordings have been variable at best. For every Shostakovich/Prokofiev 1 (with Rostropovich, surprise!), there's a substandard Sibelius/Nielsen (with Barenboim, no surprise). For every delightful ""Vengerov with Virtuosi"" from 2001, there's, well, this misbegotten Mozart programme. From the lugubrious opening bars of the Sinfonia Concertante to the two concerti, this is terrible stuff - boring and unMozartian. What should be clear by now is Vengerov is more dependent than most on the musical opinions of his collaborators. When his is the primary musical intellect, you're likely to end up with something that sounds no way like the work of a great artist.... something like this."
1,worst performance ever...,No idea what EMI thought about to publish such a poor recording. This is in no way mozart. It lacks nearly everything. This is the worst version of Mozarts Violin concertos. Go with Giuliano Carmignola and avoid this version.
3,Chet Like!,"Marcel & Chet are both gone now but not forgotten. This CD has a lot of good stuff on it,some covers of Chet Atkins hits.Great fingerpicken style. The only negative I can give is there is no orchestration behind marcel, but he is still a master!"
2,Leaky after 5 years,"I've got 4 of these faucets and all 4 have now developed leaks on the hot tap. Additionally, the cold taps are all becoming difficult to turn due to mineral build-up. Since all 4 have the same problem, I think this is a design flaw or quality defect with this faucet."
1,Off-Road Cruiser- not a great buy!,"I bought this toy for my son for his 4th b-day. He is a huge rescue heros fan and we have been quite happy with all other products- until this one. The vehicle itself is great and seems durable. The issue is with the robot that attaches under the front bumber by three small magnets. You have to line the robots receiving ends into the magnet spots. Needless to say it is difficult for an adult, never mind a 4 year old. My son is extremely frustrated with this toy. The wench is actually a part of the robot, so that when he is installed under the bumber the wench is able to be used. However, because of the lack of strength of the magnet, the robot falls off quite easily which means the wench is useless. So, buyer beware- not a real great buy especially if your child is like mine and likes to hook up and tow other things with wenches, hooks etc... We will be returning this toy!"
4,Cool cruiser,"My kids seem to be enjoying this cruiser. It is very ""cool"" looking....and the nice larger size that most RH vehicles are, but not obnoxiously large.I agree with the other reviews about the robot/tow capacity! It doesn't seem to stay in place long enough...although they have seemed to pull some things for periods of time...it occasionally falls off though with enough force. The robot guy itself is pretty cool, just wish it did it's job under the car properly. (Oh, and one of my sons doesn't get why the robot hooks more to the ""front"" to tow, rather than the back...""that's where the tow truck does it, mom! It should be in the back!""-according to him, and he's right! heehee)I still think it is worthwhile if your child is into RH/vehicles."
3,Programming Microsoft Windows with Microsoft Visual Basic .N,"This title has a wealth of information on a whole bunch of irrelevant topics such as brushes as some already mentioned. Another thing about it is that it doesn't show how to program Visual Basic.NET with Visual Studio.NET. Instead, it assumes you will use a notepad like editor and the command line compiler. If you are interested in getting into the raw side of the language, this might be the book for you. If you want a book that takes advantage of the drag and drop features of VS.NET, however, look elsewhere."
2,Not a good reference,"I'm already familiar with the topic of Kalman filtering and I bought this book as a reference, but I find that it works poorly for that. The way the book is developed, even for somebody who is already familiar with the topic, it is necessary to start at the beginning and work your way through, you can't just pick it up in the middle.The book shows much more of the details of the development of the equations that most books which makes it thick with math. Unfortunately the excess of equations makes it harder to find the equations that actually do matter to someone who simply wants to use the Kalman filter technique to solve some practical problem. Furthermore, the typesetting of the equations is inferior to what I find in most technical books, the equations are jammed together and hard to read.The book could benefit greatly by the inclusion of a glossary of the variables and notation used."
5,I read some articles of Prof. Dan Simon in Embedded.com,I found his articles are intuitive and useful for my research.If you are engineer who need to apply observer and estimation into your work. This book is good book.
5,Great Story and Very Funny,You will enjoy this comedy movie and afterwards ...you will think about life in a new way.Many memorable scenes and great lines in this movie.
3,Its Alright,"My only real qualm with this book (other than the fact that I had to buy it for Organic Chemistry) was that sometimes the explanations were very simple to understand and helped what was said in class immensely, and sometimes they really didn't make any sense at all. Good enough book though."
3,not a bad book,"i am using this for my organic class currently. we don't use it often, it is more for using tables and the homework examples, but it really isn't that bad.granted i haven't looked at a lot of other organic textbooks, but, as far as texbooks go, it isn't bad."
4,A Great Read !,Larry Bond reminds me of Tom CLancy .Patrick Larkin' s input was as always very much appreciated. I would read anything these two put their minds to.
4,Action packed,"Outdated and with an implausible premise, Cauldron provides nonstop military-style action. Worth reading if you can get past the absurd notion of going to war against Germany and France, the authors` not so subtle political bias and the one obsolete military technology that was cutting edge 15 years ago."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Having read a previous title by Larry Bond, I was motivated to try this one. I was significantly disappointed, but that's just my opinion."
4,"Good reading, but without clancy's political skills","The books starts off a bit slow in trying to ""set the scene"" -- Bond does so less believably than Clancy, who is the master of such set-ups. However, as the action picks up, Bond's skills shine through. The action, the tactics of manuevering military forces is where he is at his best. The ending is a little toopat, but I still recommend the book."
2,Not Really Good,"This is the first Larry Bond book I have read, and I was looking forward to more action. The book starts off slow, and I really couldn't get into it. In the beginning, there are several made up news article. One is about NATO collapsing, and he could have expanded on that.And it is kind of unconcievable that a wing of Polish F-15s (don't know if their talking about A or C models) would hold off Rafales, F-4s, Mirages, and Tornadoes for as long as they did.If you like political and eastern Europe allies books, you should read Cauldron, but if you like military or techno-thrillers, read Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."
2,Yeah. Right.,"This book's plot was a bit too creative. France and Germany allied together, with the French outsmarting the Germans in the end was too much to swallow. It started off well but then the plot was discovered. I found myself laughing a lot during the closing chapters. Nuclear attack on a US Aircraft Carrier. France and Germany would instantly become a parking lot if that ever happened. Big let down."
4,A good read,"A little slow in the beginning re: economics but, overall, a good read. Bond has done it again and well."
5,Some of the Best Bond Yet,"Cauldron was filled with the same devious plotting and action we have come to expect from Bond, and while it took a little while to really get going, like any political thriller, it REALLY got going in a hurry about 300 pages or so into the book. On several occasions, I was left thinking ""God, this book has EVERYTHING!!"" It has warfare on land, on the sea and under it, it the air, and even in space, using the latest weapons systems available. A must-read for any Tom Clancy fans out there"
5,What About Some French Fries?,"Well, it's a better role-reversal book than Michael Crichton'sDisclosure. The Nation of France, screwed by the Germanyin previous two World Wars, now screws all of us. The UnitedStates of America, being good in all wars, is still upholdingjustice. What a nice world it is."
3,Okay tech thriller,Interesting enough for a post Cold War techno thriller with rather different antagonists then the usual run of Russians or terrorists. Not up to challenging Clancy.
3,Very good read but based on very dated circumstances,"This is an excellent read. Action packed and not actually all that unrealistic....but.....very dated. This is an old novel I had read before and enjoyed. I wanted it for my Kindle to take on vacation. So, a very good read based on circumstances that existed 15-18 years ago."
4,Exciting but...,Good book. Larry Bond writes a book that will keep you wanting to pick it up to see what happens next. The only problem I had with it is that he always assumes that the US is going to come out the winner. Not to give anything away but read the part about the nuclear missle attack on the us carrier. Also the ending was kind of fast but overall an enjoyable book. A get it from the library...
1,Silly plot - did Bond really write this?,"I bought the hardback hoping for a repeat of his earlier excellent works. Maybe because I know the countries involved, this one lacked the ring of truth. Impossible to suspend your disbelief."
3,Is the techno-thriller dying?,"I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with this novel. I loved Red Phoenix, but this one did not measure up. I found it nearly impossible to sympathize with any of the characters. Character development was either thin, sporadic, or occurred so late in the book that it left you thinking, ""huh?"" This is what disappointed me the most in this book, especially after Red Phoenix. After Red Phoenix, I thought, ""Finally there is someone who can write a techno-thriller and develop some decent characters."" But alas, to save page space for technical gurus, the characters suffered. My disappointment may also be due to the God-like abilities of the American Military. For our country's sake, I hope the thechno-thrillers have been accurate. It becomes unbelievable when it occurs time after time."
4,"Intellectually challenging... a really good ""what if?""","Bond imagines a new Europe without NATO... a battlefield where old nations press for a new kind of political and economic power. Bond's conceits are quite good and the action of his characters flows readily from the escalating complexity of the situation. There is no lack of tension, but Bond tends to subordinate his characters to little more than puppets. They are almost all 2-dimensional, lacking the complexity that would make them interesting as human beings rather than actors. In an action novel, this is perhaps forgiveable. I still recommmend it."
5,Pick it up and forget your nap time!!!,"Another example of why ""Mister Bond"" was Clancy's techincal advisor for his first two and probably best works. Larry's Vortex was in my opinion a bit better, and the only thing I have rated a ten in a very long time! As for Cauldron, It was good, but for me, the best part of it is watching the frogs get their well deserved butt kicking! Take that and use it for fertilizer you eurodisney hating winos! But seriously, Larry tells a story the way I wish I could, the way Clancy used to,Coyle HAS but forgot how, Griffin still does, and Frank Allen Lieb should learn to! He and Dale Brown are two of my favorites. Have not read the newest yet, but will shortly. Enjoy! Matt Elyash AW1(N)(A)(ISAR) USNR R"
5,Beautiful book!,"This book is wonderfully written, beautifully illustrated. I love the story and the message too. This is a book for everyone."
5,The Quiltmakers Gift,the Quiltmakers Gift has a very good lesson for not only children but adults on giving and sharing. It was a very heartwarming story.
5,The Quiltmaker's Gift,Excellent book for children and adults even though a children's book. Very beautifully illustrated. Tackles life lessons.
5,a valuable treasure,"Though my children are grown, I still enjoy brousing the children's book section of the local bookstore. I was drawn to remove The Quiltmakers Gift from it's resting place on the shelf because of the beautifully rendered, inviting illustrations on it's cover. And what a pleasant surprise when I opened the book to find a wealth of the same along with a most touching and tenderly written story about a king living in unhappy greed amongst the finest of splendor. Yet this same greed allows his path to cross with that of a loving, giving soul who has the gift to help the king learn how to find his own happiness. It is apparent that both author and illustrator have a deep understanding of the gift of giving, and have given us a wonderful story to share with our loved ones. I found myself sitting in the bookstore wiping away the tears from my eyes and I knew this book was a must even though I may save it for years before having grandchildren to read it to."
4,Graphics Extraordinaire,"As a quiltmaker, I found the colorful artistry in this book truly inspiring. My sons, 11 and 13, found the story to be enchanting, as did I. The hearts of most quilters urge them to give their quilts away to friends, family, etc. This book makes the quiltmaker in me want to piece a quilt for every cold (either emotionally or physically) man, woman and child in the world. No one quiltmaker can do it all, but if we each warm but a few souls, the world will slumber in peace. Mary Ellen CordesQuiltmaker Wisconsin"
5,A must-have book for any collection,"My 5 year old son brought this book home from the school library...my first thought was there were too many pages for a short bedtime story! Once we got into the first few pages, the story went fast, and really kept his attention. The illustrations are great. We read it twice in the two days he had it home, and even used the pictures as a look-and-find book. This is a book that will definately be on my shelf."
1,Don't buy,Purchased these shorts and first time I wore them the seam in the crotch chaffed me raw. My wife sews and was able to put tape over seam but one should not have to do that. Would recommend finding another short.
2,bad photo,I was not made aware that this short hs a grey stripe down the leg.That is not what I wanted
5,Agatha Christi: Detective Morse: Brother Cadfael,"If you enjoy a good mystery, you will enjoy this series of stories. The Monk is never what he seems."
3,A darker set of Cadfael videos,"I am a big Brother Cadfael video fan. However, the IV Series is overall a darker, more pessimisstic, and depressing set of mysteries than the previous three sets. Cadfael's fellow monks and the Abbey come across as very ugly. Even Hugh Beringer seems brutal. Overall, I did not care for this collection as much as the others."
5,Brother Cadfael,"Excellant. Highly Intelligent detecive series without any gratuitous violence. Provides a amazing glimpse into our past, how people lives, loved and died in the 11th Century. I wish they had more of this series. Ellis Peters wrote dozens on short stories as part of the Brother Cadfael series, I've read them all and each one would make an excellant addition to this tv series."
3,See America First,"The item was shipped very quick and well protected. It looked in very good conditions but after three four openings, some pages and the cover began to break. Otherwise, it's a very great book of Westermann's prints!"
1,Almost useless and certainly confusing!,"I was hoping for better when I obtained the book. I can't believe this guy (the author) went to U.C. Some of the ideas that he presents are interesting and worthwhile to pursue, but he does a poor job of presenting them. The author took bits from each class that he attended at U.C. and forced them into an incoherent story. Many of the equations that he introduces are plain wrong, e.g., (2.7), (2.8), etc. Those that are correct (2.11) are presented in a most obtuse way so that one is left wondering: ""what is Simons' talking about"". For those who are not technically inclined this is a travesty. How are they supposed to differentiate the baloney from the fact. I understand that this is a ""traders' book"", but there are many better ones out there! Come on Howard, come on Wiley, you can do better than this."
4,Good Family Fun,"Our family does these crosswords together -- in the car, waiting for dinner to finish cooking, on ""I'm bored"" days -- and it's a great way to all hang out together."
4,I am very pleased with the results from Maximum Metabolism,"This book came along just when I needed it. Nothing had been working. I have lost 24 pounds since January. I thought I would be hungry all the time, but this program really works. I am no longer a slave to the cravings and hunger. I truly believe I had a food addiction and have overcome it. I am no longer tired and dragging in the afternoon. I feel better than I have in years. I just want to say ""Thank you""."
1,Maximum Metabolism,"I read 60 pages of this book and had to put it down. The authors advice is way out there for practical living. Your food choices are not very practical and he encourages people to take supplemental pills and powders from the health food store. I have been on many diets before and found these quick fixes don't work. The only reason I brought this book was because I was interested in increasing my Metabolism. I personally think it would be impossible in today's age to not eat red meat,butter, cheese, eggs, nuts, ice cream etc. The best diets I found that work are one that don't limit your food choices. Weight Watchers and Suzanne Somers diets are good. Suzanne Somers does limit some food (maybe 10 or so items), but not like Dr. Giller."
3,"The pictures are beautiful, the sayings are generic.","The artwork of the cards are very beautiful!! Why I will not recommend Cheryl's cards are for two reasons... First, there is NO little book inside that further takes you deeper into the message. I love the little books that are in just about EVERY tarot or spiritual card deck. The deeper messages are so meditative for me. Which leads me to the next reason, the saying alone are generic. EX: ""I am open and receptive to the power of grace in my life. I ask to be shown clear examples of how this energy is operating in my life."" This is ok for reading it but I like a deeper message to meditate on.. Why pay the same price if there are no inner books!?Which is why I highly recommend the Doreen Virtue cards over these. Doreen includes a book and explains why the card has show up in your life at that time.Overall I'm not thrilled and wished I bought a second Ms. Virtue deck instead of trying these cards."
5,Spreading grace throughout the universe,"These cards are a way to look at toning down the violence and chaos in the world. I enclosed one of these in every Christmas card I sent out this year. I also hand them out to people spontaneously, who have done kind deeds. Have also put them in my bill paying envelopes, trying to add a kinder, gentle message for someone on the other end who might find it pleasantly inspires their day. The cards have brief messages, allowing one to take just a minute to think about the message, perhaps altering stress levels or sadness. I believe it is a nice way to add positive thoughts to a world that often seems plagued with far too much negativity. If everyone did this, imagine how great it would be to displace the fear and hatred that is so prevalent in our world these days. Thank you, Cheryl, for taking the time to create these inspirational cards."
5,Amazing!,These cards are beautiful and very well made. I use them in the morning as a thought for the day and at night as something to ponder as I fall asleep. I also will draw from the deck when I need a little inspiration or guidance on something stressing me out and they always make me feel better. I'd like to buy a second deck to give in cards/gifts as little tokens of inspiration.
2,Don't believe all the hype,"I got this CD hoping to be blown away by the sound improvements and I was deeply disappointed. If your looking for that deep rich sound you heard in ""Let it Be"" (Naked) or ""The Beatles LOVE"" you won't find it here. The packaging is nice but you need a CD ROM to see the mini documentary. I would not recommend this CD to anybody especially if you purchased the original ""PAST MASTERS"""
4,Gran vinilo,"Gran disco de The Beatles, mantiene toda las características de los LP, la ceremonia de preparación hasta apoyar la púa en el vinilo es única. Me encanta"
1,More flogging a dead horse,"Let's make no bones about it, this is not a proper album - it is a cash in. If the Beatles didn't see fit to put these half baked reject songs on the original albums then, why should they try and re hash them now. There are too many Bealtles complilations out there already with slightly different track listing and ""versions"" of the same song.If I was in charge I would simply stick the best material from the 11 or 12 proper albums (you could lose about 80% of Sgt Pepper and the White Album to start with) with the best versions on, what, about 2 or maybe 3 full loaded (80 mins per disc) cds and charge a reasonble price for it like they did with Elvis, Rolling Stones and Asia. Job done! That way no one gets ripped of with duplicate or sub standard material."
5,Second disc the best,"The second disk is the best one to me--primarily because I like the later Beatles.I'm not having any problems with the remastering jobs done. In my opinion they sound very good to great. Packaging, of course, is a mess. I agree with others on that one. I'm not putting the cds back into the package, but into cd/dvd sleeves that will give them the protection they deserve. How easily they will scratch in the current packaging. I give them an absolute F on that one. What's a ""pretty"" package worth if the damn things are going to scratch one's cds? Not much. I still love the music!"
4,Read,"The remastering on this is great, but inconsistent. They could have went further. Also, why leave the early stereo recordings which were recorded for mono with vocals on one side and music on the other? It's annoying and unlistenable. It sounds great, but they should have centered the vocals. That's not changing the music. It's mixing it properly. It's a lost opportunity. If most people didn't have these stereo versions and they weren't meant for stereo why not?"
5,packaging not a problem,"unless you possess hands of steel or have the 'hippy hippy shakes,'replacing the cd's in their slots is not a dangerous task. in fact, the inner slots are smoothly lined and one would have to go to significant lengths to scratch the disc.two exceptions for using jewell cases would be ""the white album' and ""past masters"" because it's difficult to remove the discs from their slots because of the double cd design; not very good!but as for the single disc packaging, the cd comes out easily and goes back the same way.imo,not an issue.oh yeah, the music sounds darn good too!"
5,Beatles in the 21st century,"I remember the first time I ever heard the Beatles, I was around 12 and we were riding in my older's sister 1965 Mustang convertible. a one speaker AM radio, and I thought it was just great. Travel forward 44 years and here I am listening to the same song coming from a remastered cd playing in my home system slightly better than a single speaker AM radio, its basically the same feeling i had when I saw my first color tv set back in the late 60's. Congrats to all those involved in this undertaking, from the musicians to the original sound recordists to the engineers who did the remastering. A true work of art, the detail, the nuances in the music. I only thought jazz records could sound this good. Well I was completely blown away. If you call yourself a Beatles fan, you MUST get this, at least on or two of them, sit back and soak it all in."
1,This is terrible,"This Alan Mills is awful. He can't even pronounce ""mistress"", which he sings as ""misteress"". The lyrics are banal to the point that they might have been generated by one of those lyric generator things. The only classic is ""Dark Side of Me"", which is searing and great. Sorry, that's a lie. It's rubbish, too. Don't give up the day job, Al."
5,Alannah Myles CD,This is an awesome CD and it brings back alot of memories. I love all the music. It is easy to dance to and feels good.
4,Alannah Myles CD,"Excellent value but as it is digitally mastered, my choice of player is limited so i cannot play it on the mini jukebox."
2,"I've got two words for you, Tyler...","ACTIONABLE SPECIFICS. This book was so laden with sales pitches for Hicks' newsletters and seminars, so padded with testimonials, and so vague as to courses of action as to be almost useless. Also missing: Information on property valuation, handling tenants and leases, using the Internet to find properties and financing, and more...On the good side: It did give me a bit of introduction to the jargon of the real estate business, but most of all, it gave me a list of features to avoid in other books, starting with the name Tyler Hicks."
2,"Lots of General Ideas, Lots of Sales Pitches","This book is an OK introduction to the area real estate investment, but there are very little helpful specifics. There are, as other reviews have noted, a lot of sales pitches for Mr. Hicks' other packages and business ventures. Also, he is a huge proponent of getting in debt as much as possible and with poor terms and interest rates, which is a controversial way to go about things IMO.There has to be better books out there. Glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it."
1,Would not recommend it...,"More than anything Ty Hicks uses this book to pimp his other real estate packages. Not much valuable information about how to make money, just recommends dropping money on his newsletters and kits. He also just gives examples of people making money, but provides hardly any insight on anything that can help the beginning real estate investor."
1,Quite difficult to implement,"The book is really not that realistic when it comes to buying properties, especially for a novice investor. It helps with some real estate lingos but not with the trade itself. A lot of the examples are too shallow. It's like, the author only gives you an idea but does not go into details. Also, there are lots of ""plug-ins"" about the author's website and other newsletters. I think it's more of a sales pitch than a book."
1,worthless,the examples are worthless. who knows if they are even real. all he does in this book is shamelessly market his other books and newsletters.
1,worthless,"Ty's advices on real estate: very short sentences that everyone knows as common sense.Lacks real life examples, stuff he mentions are seems outdated. Worthless and unrealistic examples.Lots of sales pitch about his other books and ""services"""
3,Found the Book Motivating,"I read the Hicks book HOW TO MAKE MILLIONS IN REAL ESTATE IN THREE YEARS STARTING WITH NO CASH and I found it very motivating. The book got me fired up enough that I finally took action and really got started in real estate investing. Since then, real estate has been most profitable for me.I read that the Hicks book was on the ""Business Week"" magazine Business Book Best Seller List for 8 months and it was No. 1 on the Waldenbooks Best Seller List prepared for ""The Real Estate Professional"" Magazine."
1,Horrible!,"This is not user friendly at all. It came with 3 disks and no user manual. One of the disks has only sound files. The other 2 disks have images, but there was no way to search for what you want without clicking on each individual image. There also were not very many categories of images to even choose from. It was very disappointing. It does come with 1 year free access to clipart.com. I haven't tried that yet, but I was able to get the registration code just fine."
4,better than expected,"I wasn't sure about a subscription service, but the downloadable images are well worth the cost -- the images and other items that come in the package are worthless."
3,Chris Isaak Soundstage,"Like some others who saw Chris Isaak on Soundstage this year, and were hoping this is the same show, it is not. This is an old show and doesn't have the number of songs that the show this year had. Audio is very good. Show is shorter than the one shown this year."
3,What a wicked thing to do!,First let me say I am a huge fan of Chris Isaak....huge!I have seen Chris live and this was just not the same or close.He is as always charming and cool.Sounds great too!But this dvd just does not capture what I saw live.Maybe it is just too short (45 minutes!).I also take into account that this is a PBS soundstage presentation and not a full Chris Isaak concert. I would purchase this again as right now there is no other live concert footage out there except for what is on is showtime dvd's.
5,Hooray---More Chris visuals!,"Although this concert seems to be missing a song I distinctly remeber seeing when I first caught this show on TV (""Please""), and it is overall, shorter than one would like, Isaak's wonderful stage presense on hot pink suit save the day, and make me unable to rank this any lower than a five."
5,I love Chris Isaak,It's great to have a DVD to be able to watch Chris in action whenever I want to. Soundstage was a particularly good performance.
4,"Almost Perfection - Yes, I copied my own review. Deal with it.","This is one of my favorite books. For lack of a better term, this book is erudite: Wright manages to reference almost every mythological figure from the Amesha Spentas to Zeus himself. A keen eye will catch the Shakespearean references. The jokes regarding the old Shadow radio show. The symbolism inherent in every character, sacred item, and monster.Unfortunately--though I happened to enjoy it--Wright does indulge in a bit of preaching. And while I happened to agree with his views, I must stand up for the reader's right not to be preached at. Also, his female characters are all Magical Pixie Dream Girls. Which, while appealing to the male demographic, is a lazy way to practice characterization."
2,"Less preaching, more writing, please","The first book in this series was brilliant. Unfortunately, in this volume, Wright (who is apparently some species of libertarian) feels compelled to preach at us constantly, to the point where halfway through the book his villians are driving about in armored vehicles, cackling ""Thank God for gun control -- now we can RULE THE WORLD! Heh heh heh."" I happen to agree with most of the opinions Wright expresses, but I'd really rather not be slapped in the face with them as a substitute for good story telling. If you think Atlas Shrugged is a brilliant novel, you'll like this a lot. If you prefer actual literature, you'll be disappointed. Ah, well."
4,"Not as I remembered it, but good in a different way","I was inspired to watch this movie because I just saw the latest Billy Crystal movie in the theater. The first time I saw it, I was about 20+ years younger than I am now. Being in a different time of life really brings home the theme of the movie. I remembered it as a funny, heartwarming story. I was surprised about all the sexual innuendo and the strong mid-life themes in it. We watched it with the kids, and at one point almost turned it off.I still liked the movie, it just wasn't what I was expecting."
4,Not a bad book.,"If you've been practicing for a while, chances are most of this will sound like old hat to you. If you haven't, you'll get a brief course in concentration and meditation techniques that can be applied to day to day life as well as will-working. In either case, the book outlines how to combine those techniques with magick to imprint the specific mental states and energetic patterns in such a way that you won't need to put together a full ritual to make something happen. There are also brief tables of correspondences in the back that practitioners from every paradigm can make use of at one time or another. It's a worthwhile book to at least check out of the library, if not add to one's own library for use. You can definitely put a new spin on methods already mastered with some of the techniques Penczak describes in this book."
4,Read this books with certain other's to understand WHY magic works....,"I just got his book. I am reading it and I am very pleased. As hard Bardon is for the undisciplined, 21st century aspirant, Penczak offers very easy and practicable path/ meditative ideas that includes spells for virtually any circumstance. There are certain shortcomings from reading Rawn Clark and Bardon but the Instant Magick book is very well written and can be useful if read along the previously mentioned materials, in tandem.The best explanation of Magic as to why and how it WORKS was put down on paper by Rawn Clark who is not only a writer but a practitioner of magic/quabbalah. No doubt, Penczak also practices what he preaches but he lacks explaining why it works. Knowing why something works and fully understanding and accepting that as FACT, puts the aspirant heads above the other aspirants who just do something without a clear insight to the inner workings of mysteries."
3,"Great ideas, very creative",This is a pretty decent book. Very creative with the ways he pulls together several systems. It goes get a little spread out though as it does seem like he just adds some filler. Overall it is good to see someone taking the powers of imagination seriously as he does here. Worth a read or two.
5,"Uhh....Great book, Dude","This was my second experiance of the Deathlands series, andit, like the first, was great. I love the post-nukesenarios and the lively action. (And, of course, Ryan andKrity's escapades)."
5,Sarah rocks circa 1992!!!,"If you want to catch Sarah McLachlin rocking before she slowed it down and mellowed it out, buy this disc!!! Excellent stuff - and very well recorded!!!"
4,Solid solo outing from Foreigner frontman,"There are very few rock vocalists who can compete with Lou Gramm in full flight. If you need any proof of this, check out this second solo album by Gramm, recorded during a hiatus from Foreigner.Sure its a little too slickly produced, but then that's a problem with most rock albums produced in the US during the late 1980s and early 1990s before grunge kicked in.But on the plus side, it has great hook-laden tracks like the hit single ""Just Between You and Me"", ""Angel with a Dirty Face"", ""True Blue Love"" and ""Day One"".Gramm is helped out on guitar by Nils Lofgren and the album is rounded out by a fine cover of the Small Faces' ""Tin Soldier"". Despite its production excesses, ""Long Hard Look"" stands the test of time and is a worthy addition to the collections of all Foreigner/Lou Gramm fans."
3,"He's got the voice, he lost the band.","As a childhood Foreigner fan I would say with little debate that Lou Gramm has one of the best rock voices of our time and Foreigner was truly one of the greatest bands. In his solo project however he's still got the voice but the majic is gone. Don't get me wrong this is still a very good album w/ a couple of really good tunes but with out the rest of the band there to provide the perfect balance of voice, band, and lyrics it just doesn't reach the bar that was set so high. Very close but not quite the same."
3,"An exciting mystery for 2/3rds of the novel, but then drags.","Neil Gordon has written revisionist history disguised as an exciting mystery. His hidden agenda contains the charge that the motive for bringing in illegal immigrants into Palestine during the war was to provide ""canon fodder"" for the forthcoming war against the Arabs. Benami is accused of condemning women and children to Hitler's death machine by changing names of exit visas to include only young men presumably able to fight in the Haganah. Moreover, all his references to the Jewish government are hostile. As a novel the story drags during the last 100 pages. The motives of an outsider, Chevejon, are obscure, even though his passion for helping Danni and Luke to uncover the actions of his father, Benami, drive the story. For me, the novel was a mixed bag."
2,I'm confused,"I found the book confusing. I listened to the audiotape, so probably some points went by that I missed.How come all of sudden Dove becomes the one that looked so much like Danni and Luke that he could be mistaken for them?What would Hostermann's (sp?)motive be for helping provide ""cannon fodder"" for the Zionists? I know he got the Newman (SP?)house, but he could have gotten that anyway, as a Nazi officer.Why was Danni following his father's footsteps throughout Europe?Why did it matter where Benami started from in Greece?How did the evil Chevegian (sp?) turn into the good guy?If anyone wants to answer these questions, and wants the audiobook, I'll send it to them for the postage."
1,No Carravagio,"RE: AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. I don't demand Clancy action from a ""LeCarre thriller"" but this novel is peopled with soul-less characters waiting...and waiting.... Each seems to have been allocated one bold action then, having exhausted the quota, spends the remainer of the story speaking in trailing-off sentences. After slogging through all this slow motion until you want to slap them silly, the sins-of-the-fathers dark secret payoff has long since lost any impact. The two readers of the audio version only add to the tedium with the female contributing an unconvincing German accent."
4,Neil Gordon is the next LeCarre or Graham Greene,"I bought this novel mostly because of the title. Luckily the title only barely hints at the contents. Though this book does contain what one reviewer called ""revisionist history"", it isn't meant as a history text. It is meant as a thriller that gives you pause to consider moral issues."
1,Poorly-written history misrepresentation,"This book does not deserve even 1 star rating; I used it just because 1-star is the lowest rating the system gives you to choose from.This very shallow book is a vivid example of history distortion put to serve the author's needs to spread propaganda. He doesn't even need to present any historical facts to make his version of history believable to those who feel this urge to make a case against Israel. The author mashed his poisonous lies into a thriller format for easy, no-question-asked consumption of naive readers. Professional Holocaust deniers and their followers should like this book."
4,works,This mirror is not motorized but it significantly cheaper than a factory replacement. If you drive a car that is 12-14 years old it works perfectly fine!
5,Incredible live performance,"Dave Gahan's vocals are incredible and the music is haunting. I'm stunned that a concert can sound so good, even digitally recorded. The visuals are great and the songs are better than on the cds. ""Everything Counts"" has a different, darker feel and ""Stripped"" is powerful. ""Enjoy the Silence"" has a great guitar solo at the end performed by the legendary Martin Gore, who has a very prominent presence about him. The production of the performance is very good. This is the best of the concert DVD's that Depeche Mode has come out with. Let's just its much better than ""Live from Paris"". And even that DVD wasn't all that bad."
3,Very good and visual but...,"Being a true Depeche Mode fan and having seen all their concerts since ""Music for the Masses"" I was excited to find out about this Devotional DVD and promptly bought it. I think the album ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" shows the darker side of Dave and this truly reflected on his stage presence during this concert. Although the visual of the concert footage is stunning, I was very disapointed with the audio and video synch. Being a musician myself, I hate to see a concert where the drummer (Alan Wilder) pounds away and there is an obvious delay between the beat you see and the beat you hear... This is very dommage..."
3,"truly, a great concent film but needs a tweak","i was frustrated on the video quality, like on the other review it truly is ""grainy"", i even own the VHS devotional and watched like 20 times and i never complain on the video qualityaudio is the best part of the DVD (PCM & 5.1)i'd rather turn-off the TV and just listen to the tracks (that's how bad the video is)"
2,"Just Okay, NOT the best DVD of DM","I am a big fan of depeche mode and i love their music.I also respect anton corbin and his work. BUT.This video is not the best I have ever seen. Yes, I said it.PROS-The stage was well designed and the backdrop tv screens were very creative.CONS-But this video was not that exciting because it was too long-They showed the crowd way too much. If you like to watch people screaming for hours while you wonder what is happening onstage, then this is the video for you.There also wasnt enough of dm being interviewed.CONCLUSIONI have the other two depeche mode dvds called ""DM the Videos 86>98"" and ""Depeche Mode-One night in Paris"" and they are both really exciting and well done."
2,Dark and Strange,"Fan of the band, saw them live, and enjoy a great deal of their music, but just not a fan of this show or DVD."
2,"rent, rather than buy","I don't own any DM albums, but I do like their music. This concert DVD was interesting to watch a couple times - the visuals are intriguing. But the music performed live isn't complex enough to make me want to listen again and again. The singer looks high on E, and lets the crowd sing for him way too much. It's worth watching as a rental, but save your money."
1,Obsolete,"Unfortunately, the book is now obsolete. The software is now known as Orcad Capture, version 9.2, and Orcad Layout, version 9.2, there are little similarities between the current software and the processes described in the book."
5,Information from Author,"To see the book cover, detailed table of contents, anda rich set of supplemental materials please visit thebook site: sofpower.com/wdp"
3,Hutton's great,"Hutton is extremely good in two roles, playing Thad and his evil persona that turned into human form. somewhat of a slow pace, which lags this down a bit, but then the finale when evil Hutton gets ripped apart by all those sparrows that enter into the place is just awesome. there's a lot of evilness to the way Hutton puts it into his character and you can see that when he slices the victims up."
1,Buy the Book and Cross of the Title of the DVD to watch it,"Many transfers of books to movies are less than perfect. ""Misery"" by Steven King - great book - poor adaptation on film, but viewable. ""The Firm"" by John Grisham - could not put the book down - movie: poor ending, but good acting, and enjoyable. ""The Dark Half"" is by far the weakest book to film I have seen. The book is excellent - descriptive, vivid, horrifying at times, one of King's best. I am not even sure if those who produced the screenplay even read the book - perhaps they picked up Cliff's notes. Anyone who enjoyed this film did not read the book. I did. That's what ruined it for me. If Hollywood wanted to package this with a different title, this incredibly short film may be palatable. Be forewarned: If you've read the novel, and you purchase this movie, you will be putting it up on the secondary market soon!"
3,The Dark Side revisited,"The actors did an admirable job. The story was a little disjointed, but, one could follow the story line. Enjoyable experience for fans of Stephen King."
2,Hmmmmm,"I wouldn't go as far to say this is the worst Steven King remake, but it certainly isn't among the best. The story is rather muddled up (not because the screenwriter has messed with the story, it's just quite strange anyway).Maybe the whole point is to take you to oen place, and drag you away in the other direction, which does work in some films, but you don't really get deep into this film. You can't get in touch with, nevertheless well acted, actors.I do not see the film as a horror film. . . it doesn't really have any elements of suspense or chilling screws in the plot. Maybe I am expecting TOO much from a Steven King remake, but please. If you are going to do a Steven King book at least pick the best one's and make them good (i.e the amazing Carrie, and Shining).Hope you found this helpful.If not. . . too bad. :)"
1,timothy hutton should be ashamed of himself,"why are most stephen king novels that are mildly brilliant all turn out to be absolute decrepid gutter ca-ca? (tommyknockers, storm of century, Needful Things) I mean Stand by Me, classic, Shawshank classic, this is just so awful, and its amazing the fan base George A. Romero has, he has got to be the biggest joke in the industry, save for some really visually impressive scenes in Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead was just an absolute B Movie joke.To think this movie has a fan base, reminds me totally why I live alone, and choose my friends wisely. The film has no depth, no character interpersonal qualms, lacks emotion and undearing understanding of consequence, and utterly sinks beneath the spectrum of talent, and Hutton should cringe whenever he is flipping through the channels, and happens to see this on TBS.A 1.5 for some sophmoric cinematic magic."
3,"Disappointing transfer to the screen, but still a fun film.","Although this movie was not near as good as the book was, it did have its moments. The acting could have been so much better, especially the actress who starred as Thad's wife. She was just so unemotional. Her acting was so fake. Timothy Hutton's wasn't, though. He did an excellent job portraying both the clumsy hero, Thad Beaumont, and the terrifying George Stark. There were many times I wished they had put more into the movie. There were many parts in the book that would have looked so good on the silver screen, but they weren't used. I have to say, though, the conclusion was excellent. I thought they weren't going to pull it off, but they did, sparrows and all."
5,Great flick!,"Contrary to what other reviewers have written, this film is actually great. It's not corny or mindless like many other films of King books (or some of King's books for that matter), it's VERY suspenseful and the ending is really psychedelic. In actual fact, this is one of the handful of S. King films that doesn't pander to the masses. Romero is a serious director and this film shows the substance of both Romero and the story. Imagine if The Stand hadn't been made into a stupid made-for-TV movie and had been done as seriously as this. Highly recommended!"
3,Um......,"This film had a pretty good idea behind it, but should've been better planned. Basically, you can't anylize this movie or you'll end up frustrated.Tim Hutton does a great job, and he's pretty darn cute, so he makes up for the poor plot."
1,Boring!!!!!!,This movie was boring to me and it was slow. I thought it would be better but it was a wast of my time with my wife. I could of watched a better movie with my wife.
2,A flashy and uneven production---,"How come no one on the tape is smiling if the movements promote peace and enjoyment? I found this video hard to follow. The narrative wasn't keeping up with the changes in movement. I would be doing one exercise only to look up at the video and they had all changed to something else. The descriptions of the pressure points weren't clear enough. Sure, some of the stretches definitely felt good, but because the tape was so broken up in segments, I felt like I didn't really experience a real ""workout"". A better tape for beginners is Discovering Chi. That one has a warm-up, great stretches and a real feeling of moving the chi around. Plus it doesn't have the flashiness and phony-seeming presense of David Carradine."
3,Not a bad little tape.,"For beginners it is a very good tape.When they showed the ""pressure points"" on the body and how to manipulate them, they should have done it close up so you can find the spot better.The 'superimposed"" beach and streams scenes were nice but it would have been better to film the video ""on location"".All in all....pretty good."
5,CLOSEST THING YOU CAN GET TO A PROFESSIONAL MACHINE...,WE WENT TO NYC OVER THE WEEKEND AND THEY HAD THIS AT FAO SCHWARTZ. mY 7 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SUNG ON IT BECAUSE THE WERE DEMONSTATING IT AND LETTING CUSTOMERS USE IT. AMAZING DEAL. THE ONLY REASON WE DIDNT BUY IT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE A TRAIN BACK TO NJ AND THERE WASNT ENOUGH ROOM. BUT WE PLAN ON GETTING THIS ONE VERY SOON FROM THE INTERNET.
4,very pleased with this product!,Good sound and easy to put together.Only thing that would make it better would be a color monitor.But for the price I'm pleased.
2,Monitor does not work,"I purchased this item because of the high ratings, but once I received it, I realized the monitor did not work. We have done everything we know to do to make it work, read the manuals, etc.. and it still will not work. I paid over $50 to have it shipped 2 day (it was shipped extremely FAST and I received it the very next day), so that is why I hate to have to pay shipping to send it back. The lyrics do show up on a tv, it's just disappointing for the monitor on the actual machine to not work. This also means the camera on the system doesn't work.As far as the sound, the cordless microphone does not work and when you sing into the other microphone, the sound in one of the speakers cuts completely out. NOT what I expected for a total of over $277.00."
4,"Singing machine fun, Amazon.com great!",I bought this for Christmas 2009 for my husband. He loves karaoke and it was something we could use with our friends and family. When it arrived the door to the CD compartment wouldn't shut as a plastic piece had broken off. We used it for a few days by taping the door shut then returned it. Amazon.com was great with their returns and we had a new karaoke machine literally the next day after filing a return. The karaoke machine sounds great and it is really fun. We just need to keep collecting more music!
1,beware,"think carefully before buying this brand. Bought another model (cost [...]), broke in 1 week. not under warranty and company does not repair their product."
3,Microphone Noise,"When you are using both microphones the one that is not connected to the unit makes a noise through the speaker. I realize if you are standing close it my squell, but this is when you are further away from the unit. Don't know what is causing this. But I don't like it."
3,Need Followup On Cordless Mic,"The machine is great, but the cordless mic does not work and I have emailed them several times for help and have had NO response!!!!"
2,Monitor quit working already,"We are very excited about our karaoke machine, however, the screen monitor on it quit working and its not even two weeks old. I have to look up where to take it to be fixed. It does work on the 52 inch screen TV of ours though. And I have to figure out how to make videos and recordings still. But all in all, we love it."
4,Great fun for all,"This machine was purchased for use at a local Boys and Girls Club and i have to say it is the most well invested money all year. The kids really love the chance to sing and hold the microphone and it has been a wonderful introduction to them of music as we begin to develop a music program. It has caught their interest and imagination.... and the staff loves it so much I have to be sure they allow the kids time on it!!!Great purchase,... great funIt is easily portable enough to move from room to room as needed, yet it is large enough that the kids feel important when standing behind it to sing!!!"
3,KIDS LOVE IT!!!!,"I RATED THIS ITEM A THREE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS, THEY SOUND MUFFLED. BUT, I PURCHASED IT FOR MY KIDS AND THEY LOVE IT."
4,A huge hit!,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it was a hit not just with her but with the whole family! We have not yet hooked it up to our TV sound system, but the sound from the speakers is just fine. The only negative is that the second wireless mic does not come with the special battery it requires so we have not been able to use it yet and must try to find out where to get the battery. Other than that, we love it so far."
5,Wonderful,"I have never worn Softspots before, but I don't think I will ever wear anything else again. They are so comfortable, and have been from the first moment I put them on. I can wear them all day, and my feet aren't tired. They look professional without hurting my feet and causing all kinds of problems. Really good buy for the money. I have paid a lot more for shoes that don't feel any where near as comfortable. Size is accurate. Didn't have to exchange or break in."
4,SoftSpots Pennie,A very nice shoe & great looking. I had to return it because it wasn't narrow enough but it looked great on me & I was tempted to keep it.
2,Didn't work for me,"I think these shoes are the cutest things, so I bought them, unfortunately when they came in and I wore them to work after just one day I knew I couldn't keep them, amazon and this company were great about giving me a refund."
2,Only for those who don't have the original albums....,"I was dissapointed to say the least, being a long time String Band collector - I was under the impression that this was something new - unearthed from the archives. These discs are the same as ""The Chelsea Sessions"" combined with ""First Girl I Loved - Live in Canada"" - my mistake for buying it to begin with without checking the tracklisting. The only saving grace is the inclusion of ""All Too Much For Me/Take Your Burden To The Lord/Light From The Lighthouse"" on the first disc and the fiddle tune ""Hag With The Money"" on Disc 2. Be aware that ""Ithkos"" is left off this new set (probably 'cause it's over 10 minutes long) - You are now forewarned - but by all means get it if you don't have the other 2 - don't make the same mistake I did. That said, All ISB albums are worth having. Just be aware that this release is nothing new just a repackaging with some bonus cuts"
4,This is NOT a fun read...,"I very seldom read a book I don't care for, and quite a few of the reviews point that way. However, this book told a story of a man's perception of right and wrong. Jack's internal conflicts and his thoughts do get a little wordy, and he does have a problem relating to females. But the morality involved here is quite interesting. To say this couldn't happen in the small town you live in? Probably already has. It's an unfortunate slice of reality; nothing joyful, warm and fuzzy about this story, but it does create a thought process. I can't stop thinking about the ending... You won't believe it... Four stars just because the ending was such a surprise...as said before... NO PEAKING!"
3,Will you like White Crosses? It Depends.,"One reviewer in this series says (s)he ""has never read a book in which so much was said about things of no relevance."" It's that irrelevant material that makes White Crosses a winner for those who read fiction to find truth. Mr. Watson is a keen observer of the minutiae of human nature, and it's in that minutiae that White Crosses shines. It's the implausibilities of the basic events of plot that drag this book down from the four stars it might otherwise deserve."
2,"Lots of Potential, Not Always Realized","I just finished White Crosses and it did have something to say about the human condition--the morality of seeking the truth. Someone should have told the Sheriff that ""the truth shall set you free."" In the end, Nevelson should have realized that it was not his job to be the purveyor of truth and standards for his town. I did have trouble with Nevelson's characterization; I agree with another review that he was not a terribly likable character. (But then neither was anyone else.) All of the characters were a bit two dimensional and could have been drawn more carefully. I also did not care for the ending...but do find that the book has occupied my thoughts since reading it. I wonder if any of the other characters would bother to rewrite the circumstances of the ending (don't want to give it away) to salvage Jack's reputation?"
4,Watson's poorest effort but still worth a fun read,"I'll admit it - I've slowly quit reading stock mysteries to read Watson, Perez-Reverte, Japriscot and their ilk for my casual suspense fun. Watson's strength is the realism and complexity he builds into his characters. His is the genteel gritty of small town people, the clouded introspection of the flawed. In this case a sheriff and the high school principal are the core of failure - where the attempt of the sheriff to protect the reputation of the principal (after the principal and a female student are killed in a car crash) leads deeper and deeper into deception that threatens the sheriff's marriage and self-image.It is probably not fair for me to consider Watson a quick, light read - that implies more fixed genre/pulp writing than Watson provides - but I don't want to imply that he belongs with the Hesse, Calvino, Scliar level.Why do I tag this his poorest effort? Merely because the plot is more contrived than in his other works."
1,Why Publish a Whole Book of Outline Questions?,"A bad example of regional fiction having no real regional identity (what was it like there?); having little or no original writing (""Don't like the weather? Wait a minute."") and worst of all, a thinly described, barely likable character whose mind wanders; who asks himself a lot of questions the damned author should have answered; and then up and dies. A poor plot outline made into a weak novel."
1,Not worth continuing,"I admit I had to put this book aside and never got past the beginning. The tedious, tangential introspection of the sheriff deviated from the plot so regularly I found myself beginning to skip these parts. The sheriff's negligence in investigating the accident was so unprofessional, to the point of being completely unbelievable, I could not continue."
4,Not Up to Author's Standards,"An intriguing book, but not up there with the rest of Watson's books. I would actually give it 3.5 stars.I have trouble with the believability of the protagnonist's motives for covering up the truth about the opening car accident.Far too many flashbacks, far too much diversion from the excitement of the plot. From out of nowhere comes a reference to Jack's past, which goes on and on. In the second half of the book, I found myself skipping over these unnecessary paragraphs, sometimes pages."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book after I read the author's ""Laura,"" and was disappointed. Where ""Laura"" is skillfully written and compelling, ""White Crosses"" is clumsy and amateurish. The story itself is interesting, the characters adequate (although not terribly dimensional). The writing, however, thuds and Watson punctuates every plot development with a digression into the main character's memory that adds length to the book but adds very little to the story or the characters.I'm glad I read ""Laura"" first, because I liked it a lot, and if I had picked up this one first, I probably never would have read any of Watson's other works."
4,"Sound, superb. Action, great","This guitar, for the price, is fantastic. It has a deep, rich sound that you usually find in higher-end models. It is of solid wood construction and the fret board plays really well. It also is a very loud guitar. The voice on this thing is amazing. It plays the high-end notes perfectly and contrasts well with the bass. No buzzing and it gives a great ""streaking"" noise when you slide up and down the fret board on complicated pieces. I used this as a beginner guitar and I will keep it in my collection as it ages nicely. A definite buy for a beginner.Aesthetically it is pleasing. For the beginner it is nice because it has the fret markings on the side so you can gauge where you are on the scales you are playing. Hope this helps!"
4,"Nice Value, Nice Instrument!","This is a very nicely-made instrument. The top is a fairly high grade of solid cedar, the construction appears flawless as does the detailing and finish. The other wood is of good quality. I was very surprised for the price.The tone is decent, with no significant dead or hot spots. It would be nice to see this with a traditional light top finish, but even with the polyurethane finish, the tone is acceptable.One feature I was glad to see was a trussrod (though I did not find a wrench in the box), which is becoming more common on classicals these days. Judicious adjustment will achieve and maintain the perfect desired relief with whatever tension strings you wish to use.I was pleasantly surprised by this guitar, as I have recently seen ones selling for twice as much that were inferior in finish, materials and features."
3,It's OK,"This guitar is OK but not great, do not spend the $219.99 that musician's friend is asking for it. The 3 Low strings E,a,d sound great they project well and have great tone and sustain. But the 3 high strings g,b,e sound dull and lifeless and you have to pluck them very hard to make them stand out over the lower strings. I am going to put some high quality strings on it to see if that helps the high strings sound. But all in all a decent guitar for under $200 and Amazon got it to me quickly and in perfect condition"
3,had it for 5 years,"I have a 27 inch version of this tv. Its been fine for 5 years, but now and again i keep getting a problem at the bottom of the screen. It is during I play video games, watch dvd's vhs's and tv. It looks like when you are watching a tape and the tracking messes up. I hope it is not a serious problem. I had bought another jvc tv and it had a similar problem, so i returned it and got a sony. I don't no if i trust jvc anymore."
4,It's bright!,"I understand this' a refurb product, but it works great!I use to have Craftman, I regret. Now, I get this Dewalt, I am happy. :-)"
1,"Oh Grail, where art thou? Art thou here? Art thou there?","I am sorry to say this documentary epic is not worth viewing. It's amazing how boring a program such fascinating subject can make. The lady writer who hosts the program, walks around endlessly and pointlessly (often in slow motion), gazes into the heavens, lays out tarot cards wherever she has the possibility - and she has many. After 30 minutes or so her close-ups and limited acting ability reaches a critical level and the viewer is compelled to push the button. This is one woman's journey, and if she enojoyed it half as much as we enjoy watching it, then she enjoyed it twice as much."
5,Don't have it? I feel bad for you.,"One of the most under-heard albums in today's music...Great from start to finish...Chillin' beats and soothing ambient...Not cliche, but suprisingly accessible...These relate to Go Hawaii. If you like electronic music such as Amon Tobin, Boards of Canada, Autechre, or Aphex Twin, then you should give this album a try. I love it and still replay it every day, since my purchase a month ago. You should be able to enjoy this album on the first listen, because it's THAT good."
3,Curiously Formless,"Mr. Holm really needed an editor for this shapeless mess. It dabbles in biography and bibliography and manages to gradually become a series of reviews of several Crumb publications (seemingly randomly selected), but if you know anything about Crumb to begin with, you don't need this book. I found it slapdash and frustrating-- but it did drive me back to the Crumb comix and collections in my basement, so I guess I should be forgiving...."
2,Poor quality. Does not work with Dell Inspiron 1525,The computer does not recognise it as original Dell adaptor and does not charge my battery. It looks like it is not genuine.
5,Good product.,"I bought this product because the original AC adapter for my Dell laptop just stopped working. The original adapter was a different model than this one. My boyfriend had a spare adapter that was the PA-12 65-watt model. I used it for a couple of months and it worked great on my computer. I bought another one so I would stop using my boyfriend's. It works great and it seems like a genuine Dell product. My only complaint is about the rubber strap that keeps the cords wrapped up. If you make it too tight, the rubber will eventually tear. So, I recommend just putting it on the loosest notch and it holds just fine without tearing. I recommend this charger."
1,Poor quality,First product ordered had to be returned as the power cord that plugs into the wall did not physically attach to the transformer portion that attaches to the computer. Second product began to break within a month from purchase. Wire sheathing is separating from the transformer exposing the 3 wires encased within it. Product does not get abused.
2,Couldn't Use It,"Item was shipped with wrong power cord. The three prong cord didn't fit into the two prong slot in the power adapter. Given that it was shipped unboxed with the wrong parts I was skeptical that it was, in fact, genuine Dell. Amazon refunded my money with no hassles."
3,Dint get correct power cord,this product is good and genuine but they didnt send me compatible power cord due to which I had to spend another 10 bucks as I didnt want to return and waste time. The adapter was 3 pin adapter but they power cord that they sent me was 2 pin and I couldnt use it until I had to buy new power cord from radio-shak.
1,Dead after 3 months,Bought two in May and one is no longer working. I figured buying Dell brand would last longer than other cheap adapters which I have purchased before (and died within 6 months) but guess not. Hoping to get replaced under 1 year warranty.
1,Garbage,"This item is definitely NOT a genuine Dell charger. It over heats within twenty minutes of charging, and it stops working after two months of use."
1,It stopped working after 3 months.,"Seller said it was new, but I don't think it was. It stopped working after a couple of uses. It says the laptop doesn't recognize the adapter, so I assume it isn't even a Dell product like described. I wouldn't buy from this seller again."
3,Samuels,"This is not OEM, quality in okay. Some Dell Notebook will not recognise this charger but it will work. You are better off getting an OEM charger."
1,Does not work with the D600,"I ordered this for the Dell Latitude D600 - and it doesn't work with that model. I noticed when it arrived that it was a little larger than the one that came with the laptop, but tried it anyway. An error popped up on my desktop ""adapter could not be identified, battery will not charge"". A similar comes up on boot."
1,Unsafe,"The adapter arrived with a short in it. It began overheating within a day and was burning a hole through the plastic before it was caught. Luckily I noticed the smoking plastic before it set the house on fire. Needless to say, don't buy this adapter."
1,Weak,"The songs suck and the guest apperances suck but you knew they all would be G-unit members. The first time I listened to the cd I could not get passed the first 5 songs because they were so boring. No Cormega or Big Noyd, no good songs on the whole Cd, get Fishscale by Ghostface it's a way better Cd"
1,Wackest Album of The Year,"I'm a long time Mobb Deep fan but I think they lost me with this garbage album..The production is unbelievably wack and the lyrics are mediocre at best..I was waiting for this album for a looong time and I can't even put into words how dissappointed I was after listening to it all the way through...With an album this sorry, they are the shook ones..."
1,Sell outs,"Shitty album from start to finish, i guess after 10 plus years in the underground they got tired of not getting money so they hook up with G-unit, its a damn shame"
2,A FAN'S WORD,"THIS AINT GOT NUTTIN' TO DO WITH ME HAITNG G-UNIT OR NONE OF THAT BULL****, I LOVE MOBB DEEP MAN, THEY MY ALL TIME FAV, BUT BY FAR THIS HAS TO BE THERE WORST ALBUM YET ( WITH THE SONG EXCEPTION OF PEARLY GATES)...I EVEN LIKED ""INAFAMY"" AND ""AMERICAZ NIGHTMARE"" MORE THAN THIS ALBUM, AND THOSE BEING THERE SOFTEST LPS YET. I AINT HATING I THINK WE JUST NEED TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, AND JUST HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER. I AGREE WITH HOMMIE SAYING THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER INFAMOUS ECT. ECT.... BUT THE REST OF YOU SAYING THESE DUDES SELL OUTS, YALL CRAZY...BUT I DO BELIEVE THEY SLIPPED ON THIS ONE, AND ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE FOR BETTER IN THE FUTURE..."
2,G-Unit is dead too much 50,I used to like Mobb Deep before they signed to G-Unit now they act different and 50 is on almost the whole CD I mean damn it might as well be his CD.BlackWallStreet GGGGGGGGGG-Unot.
1,M-O-B-B,"This album is terrible. Mobb deep should never have signed with g-unit. Their beats, their flows are going downhill and it's sad to see because i am a fan of the mobb. 50 you are ruining rap."
1,total BS - WORST MOBB DEEP ALBUM EVER,definitely the worst album of 2006. where is the old mobb deep? its more like a g-unit cd with g-unit featuring on about half the tracks in this album...dissapointing. stay away from this. all the ppl who say that this is what gangsta rap is about can go to hell.dissapointed. never ever am i going to buy a mobb deep cd
2,"LMAO,the people who think this album deserves 3 or more stars are HEAVY on crack","I'm a huge fan of Mobb Deep. The Infamous and Hell On Earth are one of my favorite albums of all time,but this is just ridiculous. The people who say that we're ""hating"" try to hide the fact that Prodigy SUCKS now. Hell,He's not even rhyming on most of his songs (this has been happening ever since The Infamy came out) and most of the beats are garbage. I'd jam Get Rich Or Die Trying anyday instead of this POS,and I don't even like 50 Cent. Sad to say,but they need to give up the mic because they obviously got rich and stopped trying........"
4,stop bitchin,"I dont understand how can u complaining and bitchin about the latest mobb deep stuff. Don't be such a hip hop purest if i can say like that. How can u expect this album to be same as The Infamous or Hell on Earth. Face to the reality-those days are over. Just because 50 Cent is there doesn mean that the album should be wack. If u ask me , i m deep underground fan , but i still wanted to check this out cause Mobb deep said that the album is like the albums before. And i m telling u that i m not dissapointed.From the last 2 mobb's albums i already gave up of listening them.This is for everybody: Dont look at the guest appereance on the album. Search fot he good sound."
1,This is Mobb-Unit,"I was very disappointed this album. I couldn't believe 50 Cent said that this is gonna be classic as Get Rich or Die Tryin and as The Chronic til I heard this album and I was really like what the hell 50 Cent talking about?....Seem he lost taste in good music when he became Rich.Where the hell is Big Noyd and The Infamous Mobb, Cormega, Bars & Hooks???...how come you have 50 Cent on 6 tracks and no QB niggas???....that's cold.For Really they did falling out after Murda Muzik."
1,G-Euniched,"I am a Mobb Deep fan since Juvenile Hell, but they been G-Euniched. In Blood Money, the first mistake was having their executive producer being ""50 Cents"" instead of themselves or at least the Alchemist, which was the joint producer of Eminem's Re-Up CD. From beginning to the end, you hear ""G-Unit"" instead of ""The Infamous"" which shown them being completely sold out from their own foundation. Of their songs on the CD, the best beat goes to ""Pearly Gates"". Interesting enough, the CD has the edited version of the song because Prodigy says alot of offensive things about Jesus Christ in the original version. Other decent songs are songs that been on other CDs. But this is a G-Unit CD and if you love G-Unit, then you would love this one. But being a Mobb Deep fan, they completely lost their identity."
2,THIS ALBUM WAS A FLOP,"due to the several set-backs this album failed miserably in sale's...the album has a couple good tracks, then it also had POTENTIAL..but all that 50 is worried about is making money, and this was an obvious FLOP...in one of 50's songs ""Not Rich, Still Lyin'"" he states he is going to have a ""New Album"" released july 18th, here it is july 12th and no news on this ""album"" someone needs to tell the people at INTERSCOPE that 50 is telling everyone one thing, and not delinvering it.."
1,BLah expected much more,I enjoyed maybe two tracks off of this entire album...the production was lacking and it just diddnt seem like the mobb...and wheres the single? put em in they place? bad choice obviously because i dont think anybody has heard it on the radio or seen it on TV...this album was pretty weak i expected quite abit more from the infamous Mobb... : /
1,"50 cent needs to be dropped off to mars, along with yayo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I'll tell you why people are hating on this album. Because 50 cent took a great rap group and attached strings to them. This stuff is straight up garbage. Go get MASTA KILLA - MADE IN BROOKLYN or GZA/MUGGS GRANDMASTERS. and you will see what real hip hop is. And what the F**k is that snap music. Its looks like a rap version of a hoe down............YEE HAI cant believe rap has gotten to this level. There is only one group that can heal the scars and that is the WU!!!!!!
2,upsettin...,"so at first i also figured that mobb deep goin over to 50's label would be a good thing for them...but apparently i was wrong. comparin this album to their older ones, mobb is definitly 10x stronger on the old ones -- just like almost everyone is sayin. they do have a couple decently good songs on the album, but thats it, just a couple.if mobb wants their money, they got it, and they'll keep gettin it -- but if they want to keep their respect and quality albums goin...well, this direction so far hasnt taken them there.50 is a nice rapper, ill give him that, but he as well is slowly goin downhill and ruinin too many talented rappers along the way. g-unit was quite fine with just 50, lloyd banks, young buck (the man), and yayo (actually, forget yayo, g-unit was better when dude was in jail), but now it seems like theres too much goin on to make quality g-unit albums.underground mobb deep is where it is at -- remember that"
2,HOW DARE THEY,"yo, how could dey sell out to a puss like 50, this is pure crap, who kid, 50, g unit, there all just pothetic, right as i write this review im wearin a GUNOT t, Mobb deep needs to do themselves a favor and go get signed to Game, this album just shows wat 50 will do to a pure great like mobb deep, im was listen to Cradle to the grave, and eye for an eye, for all those who don't remember, that was on there INFAMOUS, Infamous album, do yourself a favor and pick that one up"
4,Best Album,"This is i would think this is there best album ever.Sick Beats,Great lyricsAll that i want in a song and in an albumBut some songs like put em in there place is kinda annoying after a while(the beat)Overall this is a great album to buy"
1,nope,GGGGG GUNOT...AND FORGET THA GAYME TOO HE'S WACKREAL WESTCOAST PPLC-BOYUKMOUTHBROTHA LYNCH HUNGX-RAIDEDYOUNG DRUMAC DRE RIPMAC MALL
1,G UNIT IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS RIC Q. 50, YOU WANKSTA!!!!!! LET ME RUIN HIS CAREER GAME! BLACKWALLSTREET!!!!!!! R.I.P. G UNIT!!!!! AND IM OUT."
2,Mobb Deep takes a BIG turn,"This Mobb album is different, but its still MOBB. Like time, style changes up, whether you like it or not. For example, Bone Thugs N Harmony....compare their E.1999 Eternal album to their latest releases. So if you're a true MOBB fan, just adjust yourself to the new times, hate it or love it."
3,Mobb Deep,"Mobb Deep is one of my favorite rap groups. The Infamous never gets old. Prodigy and Havoc showed that they were lyrically better than almost anybody else. I can't say that G-Unit ruined Mobb Deep because some of the beats sound great and the rest of the G-Unit clique(not 50) can contribute. But Mobb Deep should be able to tool on 50 with their lyrical style, not be over powered. Mobb Deep sounds tired and their lyrics dont cut it. If your looking for another The Infamous then don't look here. I hope that with G-Unit backing them, Mobb Deep can put out another classic."
2,album is boring,50 shoulda let havoc and alchemist produce the whole album70% of the beats here arent gritty at all...wtf?
2,This CD is a huge disappointment.....,"I'll be the first to say it, this is the worst Mobb Deep album. That's not sayin it ain't better than alot of other mainstream hip hop releases, but def their worst."
1,This thing is disgusting.......,This will go down as the wackest album ever been release by the mobb....what about us the South African fans...i agree with 9th wonder Prodigy sound depressed...but is okay cauze i still have Infamous & Hell on earth....one day 50 cent ice is goin to meltdown and may he burn in hell for stillin MOBB from us...
2,"Come on, 5 stars, really?","Anyone that gave this album 5 stars cannot be serious. This album is not Mobb Deep, and we need to acknowledge this fact. This is clearly their chance to make more money, but they do so by sucuumbing to the onslaught of G-Unit inundation. Okay guys make your money this time around but next time please keep it Mobb Deep authentic."
4,4.5 Stars,"This is without a doubt, one of the hardest LPs out right now. I am not a big fan of G-Unit but I have followed Mobb Deep's Carrer, anybody not getting this cd just cuz they signed to g-unit is a damn fool. Almost every track on this cd is a banger. Thier was a few tracks that should not have been on their but overall it was excellent. I was also A little disappointed that the features on this cd were all g-unit, no noyd or cormega. Thats why this cd only get 4.5 stars. Mobb for life!"
2,NOT TO BE TOO BLUNT.......BUT I WAS RIGHT!!!!,"SOME HOW I KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE A CLASSIC MOBB DEEP ALBUM,YES I AM A BIG FAN OF THESE CAT'S....BUT WHEN YOU ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,YOU FORGET YOUR OWN WAY OF STYLE!!!!....WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO TYMAX..GOD FATHER 3...GAMBINO????...NOYD????I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT NOYD.....BUT I GUESS G-UNIT IS THE NEW FAMILY,THATS SCARY!!!!"
1,Mobb deep been fell off since murda muzik... Fake nu ggaz!,"Mobb deep's ""blood money"" pretty much is wack as far as production goes and lirycaly its trash...Mobb sleep is tired and they do not care about the music, i quess. Ever since they second release ""the infamous"" which was a classic and third release ""hell on earth"" both classics back then. I thought these dudez were real but now i see its all bullsh*t. Gay unit and 50 is ruining hip hop and rap. It is a sad day for the true fans of the music.Its been sad and depressing for a while with every one selling out.We still got people who are trying to keep it alove which if good! Mosdef is one of them. Peace out!"
2,Mobb Deeps Worst Album ....,"As soon as i heard Mobb Deep had signed to G-unit i knew it would be right up near the top of the list for being their worst album, and i wasen't wrong!Please remind me again is this a Mobb Deep album or a 50 cent album? 50 Cent is on about 40-50% of the tracks not to mention the rest of G-unit. its more like the ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin"" movie soundtrack recycled, same sounding beats, same guests, 50 cent singing like a women on the hooks. Its good to see it flopped sale-wise because it does not deserve to move many units.I gave it 2 stars because i don't mind ""the Infamous"" or ""Put Them In Their Place"" but apart from that the album is garbageIf you wanna hear a good Mobb Deep album go cop ""The Infamous"" ... avoid this album at all costs!"
4,Unbiased Review,"This C.D. is a solid purchase for any rap enthusiast. It's the classic Mobb Deep sound, and classic dope Mobb Deep Lyrics and production their fans are used to with G - Unit members on the tracks. The album has plenty of great songs but I felt it was missing the classic song. Similar to ""Shook Ones"" or ""Quiet Storm"". 50 cent's influence is obvious on the album, and rightfully so he is the executive producer. Which contrary to an increasingly popular belief this is not a bad thing. 50 cent and Mobb Deep have a solid C.D. on their hands, and because of their collaboration more will be exposed to the infamous than ever before. I strongly suggest this C.D. to anyone who considers themselves a fan of rap music."
3,Alright album... but its not MOBB,"Before this album dropped I was hyped and ready for new MOBB music. I've been a fan since they first came out and they have always been on point. I'm not a big fan of G-Unit or 50, but I thought that it definitely couldn't hurt that they hooked up, after all it's still Mobb Deep. After giving the album a couple listens I'm a little disappointed. The classic Mobb sound just isn't there. Don't get me wrong its still better than most crap that is out nowadays, but I was aching for that grimy Mobb sound and I don't get my fix off this album. The beats are over-produced and squeaky clean. I wanted that Infamous sound from their first 3 albums and all I got was a 50 Cent album featuring Prodigy and Havoc. I still recommend the album. It shines here and there. Diehard G-unit fans should love it. I suggest anyone who loves Mobb Deep and is hoping for that straight of the street grimy Mobb sound stay away 'cuz unfortunately you will be disappointed"
1,Weak,"I am not hating on Mobb Deep because I like them a lot and I have all their albums even ""Juvenile Hell"". But this is what happens when you have a lot of money and unlimited amount of producers, you have a lot of good beats and sh$#@y lyrics and of course 50 on the hooks which are okay at best. Anyways this is worse then their debut album which was over 10 years ago. Do not waste your money on this buy something else and hopefully Mobb Deep will come correct on their next album."
4,"best since ""hell on earth""","This is to me the best Mobb Deep album since ""Hell on Earth."" Real tight beats, and decent lyrics. A couple joints Prodigy's verses sound very much like 50 Cent versus, like on ""Put 'em in their place"" and ""pearly gates."" Havoc does his normal excellent job on production, and if you know the Mobb you know they are what they are lyrically. G-Unit's cameos are all very decent, especially 50's, who picks the songs with the tightest beats to make appearances on. ""It's alright"" is a very tight joint with a great sample feat. Mary J. Blige. Features excellent production by Alchemist and Dr. Dre also. Must have for the Mobb collectors."
1,"We don't believe you, you need more people!!!!","The Infamous is a classic album. I repeat The infamous is a classic album. Now having said that it is hard to repeat a feat like that. Nas couldn't do it neither could Jay z. But what is the point in putting out an album that is this wack???? I can't beleieve these guys are still talking like they are hard. Didn't Prodigy get knocked out by keith murray twice? Which member was it that got his chain taken? My point is why are you still trying to portray yourself as ""gangster"" when it has been proven different numerous times. And you both are 5 foot 100 pounds dripping wet. LOL. This is comical. Then 50 got his hands on theses guys and really took them to the pits. ALL OF G UNIT SUCKS INCLUDING THE GAME. Don't get me wrong this ain't hating, this is just constructive criticism. These kats used to be fly but they crashed the plane!!!!!!"
1,Tired plots and shallow character development,It's obvious the guy is astroturfing his own book here. Pick it up used and read it and you'll know the truth.
3,A Childhood Favorite,"I saw this movie when it was first released - Disney's early attempt at historical movies. I loved it as a child - and loved Peter McEnery. Today, however, the movie is flat, superficial and incredibly naive. It still is fun to watch - and the stereotypes are actually amusing and innocent. I watched it on my iPad and have to say the quality of the movie is excellent. So if you are looking for a trip down memory lane - and a benchmark for how far historical movies have come - this is not a bad place to start. It's just not a great movie."
1,The Schlock of the Galaxy!,"Some people will write anything to sell a book! Don't waste your time. After reading ""Earth Under Fire"" I was more than ready to read something else by the free-thinking Paul LaViotette. The assumptions Paul makes in this book are BEYOND anything I'd consider scientifically proven. The crowning touch was the chapter about Crop Circles! Come on Paul . . . just making money??"
1,not that good,"I love Couples, but this book sucked.Didn't learn a thing.It's like watching a bad movie and you hold down fast forward hoping to find something good.And I didn't find anything.Corey Pavin's book and Tiger's are much better."
5,My Son's Favorite Book!,"My son is 2 years and 3 months old, and he CAN NOT go to bed without hearing his ""Cow Story."" He has the entire book memorized! I will read three or four words of a sentence, and he will finish each sentence! I always read in different voices, so he finishes the sentences in the voices. It is SO cute! I am pretty amazed! I am going to buy another one in case the one I have goes through an accident, and am looking for other ""sidebyside"" books that he will hopefully love just as much!"
5,LOVE IT,We have played this game for two years now. Our 7 year old and 9 year old love it. We find it has enough competition to keep it interesting and fun without stomping on each other completely. We would recommend it for sure!
1,This book is much like a terrible car smash up.,"This book was given to me by a friend. She informed me that she purchased it at an adult book store. She wasted her money. I read it from cover to cover. Why? It is much like a terrible car smash up on the M1. One does not really want to look at it; but it is impossible not to. I am a writer myself. I must admit in some way this book gives me hope. Apparently, there is a publishing company for everything. I agree with the previous reviewer;this book is filled with incest, as well as unintelligable noises. There is no plot to speak of.If tossing off in a public restroom suits your fancy, by all means, purchase ""The Vicar's Girl."""
1,Amateurish,"This embarassing book claims to tell of hauntings but the ghost tale portion of each section is sketchy at best, sometimes barely even mentioned. Statements are made regarding supposed paranormal phenomena, but are not backed up with specifics and end up sounding like gossip only. This is a very shallow and poorly written book. There are numerous annoying typos, grammatical errors and word omissions. Sometimes information is listed that contradicts something just mentioned a sentence or two earlier. I can't recall ever reading such an unprofessionally written book. The photos look like they were made with a copier, and are difficult to see. Supposedly amazing or interesting photos that have been taken are mentioned, but those photos are not included!I enjoy reading books on this subject a great deal and was looking forward to reading ""Windy City Ghosts"", but was very disappointed."
2,"Sloppy grammatical errors, ho-hum stories","This book, like the equally dreadful ""Windy City Ghosts 2"",mixes grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, juvenile type,and boring ""ghost"" stories to form one terrible book.When a published author makes a grammatical mistake such as ""...has had it's share of exciting, traumatic and terrifying days"", it's bad. When an editor fails to find that glaring mistake, it's worse.One tends to lose faith in the stories of an author who obviously rushed to get a book to press, with apparent lack of interest in both the English language and a decent ghost story.Instead of this book, buy Ursula Bielski's ""Chicago Haunts"" and ""More Chicago Haunts"". They're well-written, well-researched, and it's hard to put the books down once you open them! Next time, I suggest Kaczmarek conduct more thorough research into both Chicago hauntings and common English language sentence structure."
1,Seller never responded to calls about broken item!!!!,"I received this toy and upon opening it, saw that the arm was broken. Upon seeing this, I immediately called the seller...no response. I called again two days later and again left a message describing the problem....no response. I tried one more time that week and gave up. Working full time and raising two young children does not lend itself to going after sleazy sellers! BUYERS BEWARE of this company. To date, I am out the money for this toy and the shipping and still have gotten no reply!! What an outrage!-A.B. Chicago"
4,a great album- a must-own,"Moi, je n'achete pas beacoup de CDs, et j'ai jamais acheté une album franais, mais cette album est vraiment bien. Je crois que elle est un bon cadau pour un ami, ou un petit(e) ami(e). Toute la famille peut l'écoute!"
3,perhaps too girly,"This book has good and useful information, but I find it too focused on the ""traditional household"" concept. It could be improved by revising for the current trends in american cooking and the people doing it."
2,Not My Style,"If you enjoy tasty and original style meals, then this cookbook is probably not for you. It has some great concepts and tips on freezing, but I find the recipes to be a bit bland and boring. I enjoy making more creative dishes with more flavor and flare, but that is just me. I think I will stick to the ""Quick and Easy"" recipes from my favorite Gourmet catalouges and websites. I found that in the time it takes for me to put all of these recipes together for dinner, I could have created a ""fresh"" and tasty dinner just as quickly. This would probably be good for a working mom who's husband is normally cooking dinner for himself or the kids. (No offense husbands, but we all know you don't have the patience to cook a real meal!)"
1,Tasteless and boring food,A cookbook written by someone who hates cooking. How good can her recipes taste? I rest my case.
5,"Awsome, information, filled book!",This is a wonderful book to help you get started with freezer cooking. Everything is laid out very simple and easy to understand. If your thinking about trying cooking OAM this is deffinitly what you need.
5,It's so Easy and Fun!,"This book is great! It was much better than I expected. Don't order it expecting to be entertained - this book tells you how to get the work done! There's only about 45 pages or so of ""reading"" and figuring it out. The rest of the book consists of worksheets that help you figure out when you need, what order to do things in and how to get started. The last part of the book is recipes but not weird recipes (My husband is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy and he even liked these!). The recipes are especially designed for freezing and even has the ingredients arranged in tables so you can prepare for 1 meal or up to 6 meals! These ladies are just normal folks like you and me who figured out a way to same time and money!"
5,The Freezer Cooking Manual from 30 Day Gourmet: A Month of Meals Made Easy,This book is very informative on how to prepare for making meals for 30 days in one day.
1,"Renea Walker White City, Oregon","I'm a busy full time mom of 3 with a full time job. I bought this freezer cooking manual in hopes of some new ideas to speed along the cooking process, so I can get on to more important things. But I must say, that I'am very disappointed! I have found these recipes to be very plain, simple and flavorless. This is what I would call KID FOOD! If that's what your looking for , that's fine. I like saving money, but I also believe in feeding my family well. All the recipes in this cook book are quick and easy to make, but I feel that I could whip up something just as quickly with out all the prep work on a daily basis. And it wouldn't be frozen either! I must say that I do find the worksheets to be helpful in all your meal preperations."
5,Best freezer cookbook I've ever used,This cookbook is amazing. It calulates everything for you. It has forms and documents to use for your planning. I love the meals in here. They taste as if they were freshly made. The ingredients are usually ones that you have on hand. Easy and fun. Great cookbook. An investment you'll be glad you made.
4,Pretty Good - Smaller than expected,This cookbook is rather thin and contains no pictures - I'm a visual person so that didn't appeal to me. It does contain wonderful charts to help you with planning and several recipies that sounded enticing. I'm glad I checked it out from the library first. I would have been disappointed to spend that much money on such a small book.
4,"Great idea, very organized","I have cooked like this for 9 years and always like new ideas for variety. Marybeth Lagerborg and Mimi Wilsons book got me started so I am used to their system, which is great. Perhaps thats why I found this one a little harder to follow, its not quite as step-by-step. However, I am a seasoned make ahead cook, so I can use the book just fine. Most of the recipes are similar to the Lagerborg/Wilson book, but have the nice added advantage of the larger portion calculations done for you. I don't like the fact that you have to calculate your own shopping list, but I understand why they do it: so you can customize your cooking day recipes yourself. I really like the forms and the website access, which helps keep new ideas coming. I would buy this again, and I think if I met these two gals, I would really like them!"
3,Works Nicely... for about a year and a half,I installed this in my woodworking shop above my workbench where I sand. I wired it to a switch and ran it for a few hours at a time on average. This was by no means left on for a year and a half continuously. It worked great until it didn't work at all. I think it died one night while running. Bought it Feb. 2011 and it stopped working Fall (maybe Sept.) of 2012. What sucks is climbing on the roof of my workshop to reinstall a new one (along with the cost of course).
5,HIghly recommend,I bought quite a few nature tapes before I found this one. It is by far the most realistic and best sound quality. The 30 minute tracks are wonderful. Your home will be an oasis - animals love it too! Thanks to the previous reviewers for helping me find it!
3,"Not the same as the original ""Environments 3""","The 3rd lp put out in this series in 1971 had the sounds of the 1969 Central Park ""Be-in"" on one side, and ""Dusk at New Hope"" on the other. It seems unlikely that Atlantic will ever release that version again, though."
1,Totally Useless,I've had this book for an entire year here at Microsoft and have yet to use it to any satisfaction. Currently it is making a good door-stop. Instead I have found much more support for vbscript in my web pages from books like Professional Active Server Pages (both 1st and 2nd versions).
1,Don't Bother,"Maybe I was looking for the wrong type of book, but as soon as I looked through it, I realized this book wouldn't be very helpful at all and promptly returned it. This isn'y for you if you want to do ASP."
4,DEFINITELY some of Frank's best work,"If you don't own this music, you should. This is some of the best work of one of the most original artists of our time.At the same time, it should be understood that these are re-releases, and there is no original material here. The Zappa Family Trust are simply finding new ways to market old Zappa. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm all in favor of anything that will help keep Frank's material shaking up the air molecules. But I already own Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, and The Grand Wazoo. If you do too, there's no reason to buy this box set.That's the only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars."
3,"I've played it twice, and only twice","I agree with all the other reviews, there's LOTS of dialog. But I've found an answer! I've found if you press the Esc key, it will skip over dialog. Some things you need to hear, because it gives reference to where to go next. But most of it can be overlooked, I think. The second time I played it, I skipped all the dialog and actually PLAYED the game.The scenes are great, too. Lots of detail. It's a good game, but I love MYST more. Syberia & Syberia 2 are good games too. I would say they are superiour to The Longest Journey. But you can make up your own mind."
2,"Loooooonngest, most tedius Journey","Cool graphics, but it's so tedious and contrived that it feels like it's taking forever! It takes a long time just to run back and forth between the locations only to sit and listen to a lot of babble. When it finally comes time to solve a puzzle, most of the puzzling is done for you!"
3,Longest Journey I've ever taken...,"This game sure is LONG. That's not a bad thing though, it makes it seem worth the money. If it was shorter you might feel ripped off.Some of the puzzles are really easy and others are simply ridiculous. The background story is really hard to follow and doesn't make a whole lot of sense.The worst thing about this game though is all the talking and reading that is required. A simpler storyline would have been better. All the mumbo jumbo that goes along with the story is not necessary to play the game. It also takes forever to get anywhere, the character walk/runs so slow. You can speed some things up with the ESC key but that is a pain to do all the time.Overall the game was not all that bad and I'm glad I played. It was only $10 anyway so it was worth the money."
3,More then a little frustrating at times..,"There was a lot of buzz around this game when it originally came out. and while it is an entertaining 3rd person adventure game, i was left feeling a bit disappointed. There are several points in the game that become extremely difficult to get past. not so much because the actual game play is that hard...but more because it's just not that easy to get around the vast landscape. And there is the downfall of this game. there is just too much. of everything. too many characters, too many locations to try and keep track of. And while i did end up enjoying the game over all...i still feel that less would have been more."
5,"A very good 2D game, almost 3D","This is a very good puzzles game. You have 2D graphics with very good details, and you have many challenges understanding what to do, according to dialog. I think you will get some troubles with newest video cards but I have W2K with SP2 and this game is working with ATI Radeon 7500, no problems. I gave the game (testing) to others friends with old machines and this is working OK too."
3,The Longest Boring Jouney,"Yes, the graphics are good as is the voice acting but this has to be the most boring game I've ever tried to play. There is way too much talk and not enough action as the conversations go on for 5 to 10 minutes with each character. Yes you can skip the conversations but if you do so you miss out on some of the info you need to play the game. I suggest you play Grim Fandango or Syberia instead."
1,Didn't work,"I tried running this game on a PC with Windows XP and it worked, except the graphics were splotchy (for example, her clothing was invisible so all I saw was a head, hands and feet) and the saved games wouldn't load. I can't play the whole thing in one sitting and therefore I haven't gotten past the first hour or so. I emailed the company and looked online for a patch... they never returned my email and there is no patch. The game might be great... but it doesn't look like I'll ever know!!"
1,a HUGE disappointment,I had high hopes for this game but was severely disappointed. I must have forgotten to look at the rating when I bought it because I ended up throwing the game away after hearing the F-word over 20 times. I also had to go and download a complete walkthrough because I was having such a hard time finding my own way through the game. It would have helped if there were some sort of clear checklist to follow in the game.
1,Slow and boring!,"The language in this game is appalling. I don't see the necessity of vulgar language in any kind of computer game. Also, the game is slow and boring. I gave up trying to enjoy it and decided I had just wasted my money. If you are thinking of purchasing this game, don't. There are many more games out there which are more enjoyable."
2,Crashes with XP,"It's mentioned in many other reviews but just in case you are thinking that it will work fine of your XP machine think again.I can play the game but everytime I save, the game crashes when i try to return.The conversations do get long winded. I probably would not have become so frustrated if the game didn't crash so much and leave me going through the conversation again."
2,Didn't really like this one,"I had heard such great things about this game but in all reality I found it very boring. WAY too much talk, most of it irrelevant. I finished the game, but skipped most of the really bad dialogue. I would recommend Syberia and Syberia II instead."
2,Unstable and lame...,"This seemed like a good game at first but later it became clear that it's more like a boring movie. Conversations are SOOOO LONG that I wanted to tear out my hair - and I like the more story-oriented games; but this is waaay too much. It starts out pretty interestingly but slumps down quickly and never returns. Graphics and music are really good (that's why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.)The game is also unbelivably unstable - it crashed so many times that I stopped counting after 50. I must admit, I haven't finished it yet, so it may even turn into the best games ever evetually, but since it crashes all the time, I just don't see that happening. The patch is worthless, I couldn't even get it to install (I'm not sure if I have the latest version and cannot find out.)Avoid it."
4,Very Difficult game but I love it,"I am in the 3rd level ""Friends and Enemies"" and the truth is that I cannot leave the part in that April Ryan has to take out the policeman of beside the remains of the ship that you shatters, I don't find the solution somebody can help me to leave of there.Outside of that I find the game wonderful.My email is vdirhip@infomed.sld.cu"
2,"The Longest Journal -- er, I mean Journey!","I'll make this short: This game is BORING! It has nice graphics, a so-so storyline, lots of unnecessary cussing/VULGAR language, and WAY TOO MUCH DIALOG!!! I can't tell you what the ending is, because I'm only halfway done and ready to fall asleep. SAVE YOUR MONEY! (I only paid [...] and it's not worth that!)"
3,Nothing close to the best in adventure,"As far as recent releases for adventure games go, The Longest Journey is reasonably decent. It's not full of sexual elements to get people interested, mystery themes, feeble attempts at being creepy, etc.That doesn't mean it's great. While the adventure game genre is practically dead, people don't have to resort to games like this for ""quality"". The voice acting is mediocre, at best. The plot isn't engaging. Some of the concepts may be creative, but the puzzle solving isn't (like almost any other remotely recent adventure game). If you haven't already, check out practically any older Lucas Arts adventure. Look for more obscure titles, too--there were a lot of great adventure games and the like to come out for Windows 98."
3,Good potential...,I only played the first bit of this game before I became bored of moving from place to place to go back and get things I forgot. Solid concept but I was just too impatient.
1,My suggestion - buy Syberia instead,"I didn't really like this game much. I found it rather too verbose, frustratingly verbose and boring. There is so much mindless blabber to wade your way through, and wade your way through you must as the clues are all in the speech.But worst of all was the ending which made a complete mockery of the entire quest and left me feeling drained and depressed.I say forget this game and buy Syberia instead, which I found so much more interesting and fun to play."
2,No pause on the dialogue,"I was really looking forward to this game. The first hour was great... graphics are cool, April has witty, sharp biting things to say, then characters kept talking and talking and talking. And once they start you can't pause until they are done. I missed a big chunk of one explanation because the phone was ringing. (you can look in your dialogue log after) And the puzzles are way too easy. I wouldn't even call them puzzles, rather simple tasks to get you to the next long conversation. The story is pretty cool, I might keep playing just to see where it goes, but don't think of this as a game, think of it as a long movie where you get to click the mouse every once in a while."
3,Even April fell asleep...,"I love adventure games and this one was recommended to me by another fan.What I liked about it: the surroundings; imaginative and versatile. The voice acting; wonderful. The story; witty.What I didn't care for: The yakking; really, they talked and talked and talked endlessly and unstoppably and to proceed you HAVE to listen to all of it. I nearly fell off my chair laughing when even the main character fell asleep at one point. The graphics; chunky and crude. The puzzles; please, give me at least SOME challenge. I am a simply person and I needed a walkthrough for all of the Myst games, but this one doesn't deserve to be called a game with ""puzzles"".Overall, I'd say this is a nice game, if you can stand more talking than action, and if you don't mind some bad language. I recommend it to people who liked Syberia, for Myst fans it may not be what you are looking for."
5,Written by my Great Great Uncle,"I am looking for this book PLEASE PLEASE contact me at brennatroyan@yahoo.com if you have it. Uncle Oscar was my grandfather's favorite uncle. He was crippled as a young man in a horse riding accident, but continued to ride anyway. My grandfather describes him as having massive upper body strength (no doubt from walking with his arms and pulling himself up onto his horse). He never married or had children, but he helped to make my grandfather the man he grew to be. According to my grandfather, Uncle Oscar did a copious amount of research and interviews for this book."
1,Graduate Student from Caltech,This book is better than some textbook because of its clear edition. But the concepts in this book seems like copied from other two textbooks.It is pity that we cannot get some new concepts from it.
5,GATE CMOS,"GATE ANALYSIS OF CHANGES OF FREQUENCY X AXIS GATE OUTPUT. FABRICATION SHOWING MASKING OF CMOS. LOGIC ANALYSIS OF CIRCUITS. LOTS OF MEMORY BIT DETAILS RAM, EPROM, DRAM. THIS BOOK HAS IEEE DETAIL. READER SHOULD HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF ADDERS AND CLOCK FUNCTIONS BEFORE USING THIS BOOK. LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION AND LOTS OF DETAIL GOOD BOOK"
1,I totally agree with you,"I agree with the previous reviewer.It is hard to understand the the equationsif Dr.Bond don't give any explains or derivations.How could he get lots of formula and paste them togetherwithout any "" derivations"" ?"
1,not good as a textbook,it's really a mess when i read this first 4 chapters.the authors just put all the pieces of concepts together.i suggest readers to buy another book from purdue's professor.
4,Essential for beginners,"This is an essential DVD for beginners. Be aware that it is very, very basic - there is a huge emphasis on ""beginners"" in my opening sentence. The course is also very short."
2,Very Basic,"The DVD is appropriate only for absoulute beginners, not just on dirt but on a motorcycle. Most of the time of the feature is spent on such simple basics as getting on or off bikes. Towards the end it does talk about some of the dirt riding tips such as why and when should one stand and ride, weight distribution, etc. Wouldnt recommend for anyone who already has bike riding experience and definitely not for people who already do some basic dirt riding as it add no real value to those for sure."
5,Bach Organ Works at the Rieger Organ NYC,"Mr Newman records here for the second time Bach Organ Works.There is nothing written from the composer on registrations to be used.There is no tempo indication,slow is good,fast is good as well as fastest.There is freedom, like the one we all USA citizens -Mr Newman included-enjoy of living here.No dicctators telling you how to play or live.If youenjoy freedom and are open mind regarding how to live, you will loveMr Newman way of playing and I recommend you buy this CD.On the contrary if you live in a Dictatorship and never had a chance to listen to BAch other ways that the one you have, you will never understandBach and his musical ideas and his music in general.Hugo SAldiasDenver,CoUSA"
4,Non-Fiction,"A global smorgasbord.A large size book that has a pictorial spread showcasing some of the beers for each country it covers, from all continents. Antarctica doesn't have too many native beers though.Will definitely make you want to find a few you find that you may not have seen before."
5,"Didn't need it, so I returned it. Amazon was great on the return.",Got my full refund minus shipping. My daughter didn't need them after all. I had her on a balance bike for three months and then she took off on her first ride of her new bike. No need for the training wheels. I wish my son learned like her. :-(
1,wish they would have worked,"I am 21 and just learning how to ride a bike. I was so excited when my husband purchased the wheels for my 26in adult bike so i could finally learn without being scared. They held up for maybe 5 minutes before the right side ""tire"" popped of the wheel and bent in half. The the left side bent in half not so soon after as i tried to get my bearings back. I was so excited but it was short lived. These are not as reliable as i had hoped."
5,Excellent product.,"Greetings--I purchased these training wheels hoping that it would be sturdy enough for my little girl. She is overweight and is on a strick diet and exercise program. The bike and training wheels that Santa Claus brought her were not sturdy. The training wheels bend as she leaned, then she fell. I returned bike to the store.I had to do some modifications to the new bike I bought so these training wheels would work. I took it to a bicycle repair shop and they installed a longer axle bolt. I installed these training wheels and let me tell you they freaking work! She is very super happy. Thanks Wald!"
1,Not fair...,"Doesn't fit on frame size over 3/4"" and that is nowhere listed honestly on amazon. After i paid and ordered and tried to assemble, finally i saw that is listed on the box cover. Not fair, not fair at all. We have three bikes and none of them is compatible with this product..Oh well i contacted the company asking my money back, and i'm still waiting.. Other day in paradise.."
3,Please check bike for derailler.,I needed a set of training wheels for my child's bike. I got her a mongoose with 24 inch wheels. It is a 21 speed bike and in has a derailler on the rear wheel. This derailler prevented one of the training wheels from being attached. It is a good product but they should tell you not to purchase if the bike has a derailler. Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund.
2,Rated low only because it didn't fit my girls geared bike,"It is nice and heavy duty. However, it doesn't fit the side of the bike with the gears on it. Not meant for these types of bikes. I was going to bend it, but the steel is so thick, I really couldn't do it at home, and taking it to work would take too long. So, we'll try more without the training wheels."
2,brackets were wrong,Bought this item based on all the reviews... the metal supports were backwards and I needed to buy new ones to support it- I did and mounted them on the bike.... I didn't complain- but I should have... anyway good...luck
5,Great set of wheels,"These training wheels are great! The wheels that came on my son's bike lasted about one month, but he's riding it a lot more with these new wheels. I highly recommend these for any size or age person."
2,Bent on first use,"The wheels bent after the first use by my wife. She weighs 109lbs, so the weight limit must be lower for this product. seems like we may be able to straighten out with a few hits of the hammer."
4,"Good quality, but required modifications","I had to hit these pretty heavily with a grinder and probably some other tools to get them to fit. Probably took me an hour total (I'm not much of a metal worker). End result was good, but hardly a drop in fit.Once installed, they have held up well."
2,Disappointed,"When attached to a brand new 20"" girls bicycle ridden by a nine year old weighing 100 lbs, it took less than 20 minutes for one of training wheels to be crumpled up beyond repair. The rubber surface of both wheels immediately became rough and worn and the wheels are very noisy. There are not very many products on the market that fit larger bikes, and this one looks promising but do not get your hopes up."
3,not for lmore,"I can't bike and I needed the training wheels because I needed to commute in this little town without a car. yes they fitted the 24"" bike but they didn't carry me for long. they bended after 2 days of riding the bike. I'm 155LB and I know that is over the weight indicated on the box, but I read some reviews in Amazon about somebody's wife who learned to bike using those wheels. well, it seems that she was much lighter weight than me.the point is: this product is good for size but it seems not for more weight than what is written there."
1,Unreliable,My son was not very happy with product. We needed training wheels that would not bend or allow him to easily tip over. they did not do the job. They are frachile and unreliabe brand. I would recoment anybody to buy them.
3,Funny..when Burt reynolds used to be...,"This takes me back to late high school, 1978, before Burt Reynolds became the caricature that he did..or at least before he stopped being funny. Dom Deluise steals every scene he's in...but the rest of the cast has little to do. Not a great film and dark for it's time..but I still laugh out loud at Reynolds and DeLuise calmly discussing how Burt needs to die...worth the time to take a look at this one again!"
4,Truly hilarious for one in the psych field.,"During a trip to the doctor Burt Reynold's character over hears someone elses poor diagnosis and believes it is his health being discussed. He decides to spare his exwife, his daughter, his girlfriend, and himself from a lingering illness, he plots & plans his own suicide. Without telling others why he is planning on this action, he gets commited in a sanitarium with Dom Delois who is also a patient. Dom decides that Burt is his bestest friend and he is going to help him do the deed, offering unasked for advice and assistance. This leads to a frolicking escape, romp, and chase with the final scenes putting it on the line - to live or not to live that is the question. This is a straight comedy, nothing heavy or thought provoking, won't ever be nominated for any awards - just a light easy viewing that tickles the funny bone."
4,The End,I had never seen this movie. It was recomended and it is a very good movie. It is all about human nature. It makes you laugh and cry. I recomend it to anyone who needs and escape and really go back to the basics of human nature and feelings.Buy this movie.Debra Envall
3,funny but unnecessary parts,"Had seen this show years ago and remembered how funny it was. I didn't remember parts of it that I would prefer to have edited out. Many times it seems that movies have sex and foul language included just for the purpose of having them there when they aren't needed and serve to take all ""class"" out of the story. This could be a really funny & enjoyable family movie it it were edited. It's really a shame. That's Hollywood for ya."
1,I wish it would end!,What did I think was so funny about this movie back in the 70's?....must have been the substances I was on....this movie stinks....it's just bad!.....I couldn't wait for it to end!(actually couldn't make it all the way through!)
4,Swimming With The Best of Them,"Burt Reynolds allows us to laugh at ourselves by our bargining skills that we have developed with God. Towards the end of the of the movie, Burt discovers that he wants to live, and thus bargins with God to let him live after attempting to drown himself by swimming out to sea. To show his sincerity to God, he dedicates at first 80 percent of his yearly earning and holding to the church. As Burt gets closer to shore and sees that in fact he will make it out alive, he lowers the percentage to a fraction of the original 80 percent earlier promised. The movie starts slow, but finishes with a punch by reminding all of us that we are not so different after all in private."
3,A LIGHTWEIGHT DARK COMEDY WITH SOME GREAT MOMENTS! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I've been on a bit of a Dom Deluise kick lately and after watching the under appreciated 'Fatso' I decided to revisit 'The End'. I had not seen this film in many years to the point where I didn't remember 90% of it. The film starts quite funny and it even reaches hilarious results in spots(the confession with Robby Benson is pure gold!).I like Burt Reynolds, but he hasn't always made such great films. Fortunately, he added Dom Deluise to this kooky dark comedy and when things get a little boring, Dom is always there to add some much needed humor. This is nowhere near as smart as 'Fatso', but I found this film to be better than average for these types of films."
4,Realtors Never Change,Very funny but dragged somewhat in the middle. I saw it when it was first released and thought one more time would be fun.
5,Blast from the past,It has been more that 20 years since I have seen this. The best part that I could remembered was when James Best was at the hospital and Burt turned up his IV and the face that James Best made as he walks away is priceless. I don't know why this has stuck in my head for so long. But this part was funny. This movie takes me back. It was nice to see again and it's time that I bought it to add to my collection.
2,BACK TO THE BLENDER,"we love Dave (and Kelly). got 'em all, but this remix just dont make it!it should be thrown in the blender, turned on high and then down the drain. sorry Dave."
5,A story that warms your heart,"The excitement of Christmas fills your heart as the author Bob Litak shares his heart- felt story with you. Most of us can relate to getting a job which was not one you asked for nor something you even wanted, but somehow turned out to be a blessing in disquise. Laughter and sadness tug at your heart strings as a friendship forms such a strong bond. Helps one to understand how much you can grow with in yourself. But most of all, it helps put the children back in our lives and makes us once again ""Believe in Santa"" If you enjoy reading a heart-felt story than I highly recomend this fantastic book."
2,complicated puzzle,"have seen this puzzle in a completed, framed form and it is very nice, however on close inspection is a lot of work as the pieces are not standard cut sizes or standard cut pieces. Have put it away for now, will work on it later."
3,return of the jedi,again it is a comic pictual versonit is good but not really suitable for ane readerit shouldbe ccalled thepictual special edition
4,Lit Crit Text,"Excellent, well-written work that is extremely helpful for the lit crit to understand the relationships between author, projected author/author persona, narrator, characters, and reader. It is extremely comprehensive and (usually) balances and objective that also reads fairly quickly."
4,Wilder at his Best,"Along with Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother this was another one of my favorite movies as a child. The scene were Wilder's hotel room floods and he forces a family to swim in it as if it were a swimming pool is hysterical. It's been a while since I saw this, but I remember many scenes of bust out laughter. Also, Carol Kane is adorable in this movie with her big blue eyes and innocent smile. It makes the scene were she is mistaken as a prostitute even more funnier then it is. I will definitely buy this when it comes out, but for everyone else I would suggest it as a must rental."
3,Passable Wilder(barely,"A fair Gene Wilder, but not in the group of great G. Wilder flicks. ONce in a while a top movie star gets miscast in a role that borders on disaster. Wilder does his best but the movie story was beyond salvation. I.m not sure any other actor could have moved the rating above mediocre. For sure, this is a movie that should never have been made. If yo see it once, you won't go back for seconds ?"
1,A most disappointing movie,"With the all star cast, I was expecting something on the order of ""Silver Streak"". Instead, I would rate it as Lead Poop. The plot was weak if existing at all. Most of the acting looked phoned in. I think the cast had a fun time making this movie. Too bad I did not have the same watching it."
2,Are you people serious? I think you need to see it again now that you're older,"For some reason I do remember seeing this film as a kid, and I thought it was great. But now, seeing it again, I don't know, I think it's really kinda dumb. I can't remember what the appeal was back then. Maybe it was because I thought Carol Kane was hot. And Gene Wilder was still kinda popular at that time.Try watching this again, believe me, it's not so great. I should have rented this dumb thing first."
5,hannibals war,"The book is amazing. It describes amazing battles and sieges during second punic war. Massive armies of Romans and Carthaginians. Second punic war was the greatest war in ancient times. Both powers were at its peak and could mobilised more then 500 000 solders. There are great commanders on both sides such as Fabius, Marcelus, Sempronius and Scipio on Roman and Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Hanno on Carthaginian side.There are many details in book and every year is described on about 50 pages. It has maps and notes and takes time to read.The book is realy exciting."
3,Spider-Man Slip N' Slide,"Once again, the box showing the product is extremely deceptive. The cushion at the end of the slide is nowhere near as big as what you'd imagine. There was a small hole in the actual slide itself when opened, and the material the slide is made from defines ""thin"". My boys seem to enjoy sliding on it, though. They have used it twice without further damaging the slide or cushion. We did put a plastic tarp underneath the product, which may have helped. Another one of those times where ""you get what you pay for""."
5,A Star Is Born Soundtrack Review,"A really excellent soundtrack to go with an excellent movie. This is some of Judy Garland's best material in both music and acting. The power of her voice on ""The Man That Got Away"" is amazing. ""Born In A Trunk"", ""It's A New World"", ""Someone At Last"" and ""Lose That Long Face"" are other recommended tracks. This is a MUST HAVE for all you Judy Garland fans."
5,The Music That Got Away! (But Now It's Back!),"Wow! I've been one of Judy's biggest fans since I was two. A Star Is Born has always been one of my favorite Judy movies. The 1988 release of the soundtrack was ok, but the sound was very muddy and muffled. However, the new soundtrack is astounding! ""Lose that Long Face"" sounds like a whole new song without the taps and the way the sound has been cleaned up is amazing as well! I'm also glad that they got rid of the sound effects (they got annoying after the millionth time of playing the album lol) This cd is worth every bit of your time and money! It's a sure bet for any Judy fan, or anyone who enjoys good music! I also want to point out that I'm glad they are finally giving these kinds of things the attention they deserve!"
5,GARLAND'S TRIUMPH SOARS TO NEW HEIGHTS ON CD!,"Judy Garland gave her greatest performance in the 1954 Warner Bros. masterpiece ""A STAR IS BORN"". The soundtrack to this film has been issued numerous times over the years, and although the last reissue (1988?) finally included stereo versions of the songs, the sound quality was not very good.This new, remastered version not only improves upon the quality of those vocal tracks, but also includes a healthy bevy of underscore cues that celebrate the extraordinary talents of Mr. Ray Heindorf as he leads the WB orchestra. Those never-before-released tracks are a joy to hear.Of particular importance here is a wonderful essay by the acclaimed author and renowned Garland expert John Fricke. His notes are eloquent and highly-informative.This is a great album."
1,Anwar Sadat was an American client since 1952,"Anwar Sadat was an American client since 1952. He was also probably the man who killed Nasser by poisoning, to bring American occupation to Egypt."
5,smooth,"first order was for 100 grit I receive 180 I sent it back and reordered 120 grit hey they got it right, didn't have to pay postage so I'd say cant get any better than that, except to maybe send the right order in the first place."
3,Good photos,"Focus is mainly on British service. Many good photos but the editing is a let down. I especially like the photo with the M7 Priest in the background, the caption from the book states that the orginal photographer listed it as an M7 but that it is a Sexton when in fact it is an M7."
2,Disappointed with this book,"This book is well written, has excellent photographs, and is one of the better books on the M-4 tank. I was very disappointed with the quality of this book. It was as if the printer was running low on ink and continued printing copies. The text and photos are extremely light and it's this way on every page throughout the book. I later compaired this book with another and the other book was printed using an appropriate amount of printer ink. The book was bound and printed in the United Kingdom."
5,Great for light doors - no so great for heavier doors,This hinge works but my door is a bit heavy which makes the hinge slow when closing the door. I would have gone for the heavy duty hinge that takes up to 80 LBS even though my door is less than 40LBS.
3,reference only,This book seems to be written before the 21st century. Language appears european or old english. Graphics are good and short summaries decent but some information is outdated for use in a classroom.
4,70's lover,"Great album from the mighty mighty Spinners. Love don't love nobody is a classic. I would love to get a version without the extra ""bonus"" tracks. They really bring down a great album. 5 stars without the bonus tracks!"
2,Too Short,"Any true R&B;/SOUL/FUNK Fan,can not truly give this album as many stars as it's worth, whomever is responsible (Through no fault of the Spinners I'm sure), released this recording wasn't a true lover of their music, nevertheless, the tracks ""Love Don't Love Nobody"" & Mighty Love, are not the actual full length album versions from the original recording, and both fade just as the songs kick into overdrive. Technically, this should be titled ""Mighty Love 2"". I am very disappointed in this offering and would only recommend it with a warning."
5,Classic,"You'll never mistake the Spinner's sound for any other. This mighty band even distinguished themselves from there Philly Soul Gamble And Huff peers.Most Spinners albums are classics, and Mighty Love in no exception. Is it the perfect vocals? The perfectly written songs? Gamble And Huffs perfectly balanced orchestrated arrangements?The answer is yes. Across all kinds of music you simply can't do better than the Spinners. Their albums are essential to understanding soul, and the best of AM radio in the 1970sGet 'em all. Get Mighty Love."
2,Nostalgic,"Gordon's book brought back memories of the old glory days of the gulag archipelago, Kolyma, midnight knocks at the door and the tank treads red with the blood of pulped hungarians. Though Gordon spent much time suspiciously in Franco's Spain, it is obvious that he is still an old comrade at heart. A wonderful book that should be forced reading in today's schools."
4,Good Read,"As an old-timer in the Hollywood jungle, I read Gordon's book with a feeling of 'deja vu'. He not only 'tells it how it was' but with color, clarity and verve.A quixotic Fate took him on a different path than many others who suffered from the blacklist and that's what makes his story stand out. Hollywood in Madrid in Franco's time was a strange place to land but he made the most of it. Phil Yordan is a real 'character'.I took ""Hollywood Exile"" to bed with me, and it kept me awake until I finished it. I recommend it!"
4,Absolutely brilliant,"Great story, amazing setting. The blend of the Soviet era and the modern era in the mid-90's is just really superb for this book. In many ways, particularly the use of lyrics and the general rock feeling, this book is like what would have happened if Bret Easton Ellis grew up in Russia and wrote horror novels. Don't let the ""horror"" tag fool you, calling this ""horror"" is like calling Phillip K. Dick or Frank Herbert ""sci-fi"". Sure, it is set in a ""horror"" setting, but the story transcends the genre quite well."
4,Way better than the movie and an exciting good time,"I purposely waited until the book came out to see the movie. In fact, I first read the novel and then watched the movie. After having read the novel I have to say it was WAY better than the film. Yeah, the movie had its moments, and I liked it, but the book really does a much better job explaining the history of the Others as well as further explores the relationships of the characters. In fact (SPOILER ALERT) I was really disappointed the movie only dealt with Part 1 of the novel and completely ignored parts 2 and 3. Anyone know whether the plan is to deal with parts 2 and 3 in the next movies?Anyway, enjoy the novel. I do strongly recommend you give it a try. If you like modern day horror you'll enjoy this book. I anxiously await Day Watch."
5,"Loved it, loved it, loved it...","The movie was excellent, but the book is amazing. It is difficult to put it down. I can't wait for the Day Watch to finally come out."
3,My 100-word book review,"Night Watch has some terrific and quirky ideas. A story of Light and Dark magicians vying with one another in post-Soviet Moscow, this has a great deal of complexity and a lack of obvious stereotypes. This is a world where vampires are not monsters but neighbours, and where ""good"" and ""evil"" are not as clear-cut as you might imagine. However, the fact that these are three stories tacked together means that the pace is awkward and the whole novel seems long and rather flabby. The ending is anticlimactic which is a shame. Incisive editing would have been a great help."
4,"A little confused at first, but it works itself out","This book is broken up into 3 stories. They all connect, but have their own endings as well. When i finished the first story i was a little disappointed as it seemed anticlimactic to me. I didn't fully understand the plots of the individual stories until the very end. It is a good read and well worth reading all the way through even if, like me, you are a little confused by it. The end wraps it all up nicely. Eager to read the next book."
4,Amazing Magical Realism,"Magic is all around us - at least, for the inhabitants of the author's world. This is not a vampire novel - its a novel with vampires, but its actually about the moral and ethical perils of being a Good Magician, which seems at least as bad as being an Evil Magician, just much less honest. The protagonist is engaging and speaks deeply to this generation. Please do not think this is Harry Potter - the protagonist here is his own man, and his boss is more than a little fallible. Loses one star for an uneven translation."
5,Falling in love is hard to explain,"The refreshing decor of this series is a great breathe of fresh air when reading late into the night. His imagination is great, and this is my second favorite book in the series (Twilight watch is my fav)I do honestly feel that he could have written more and expanded this universe further, and his endings need polishing instead of being how I often describe as a slow-sounding ""plop""A good, loved series deserves more work in it for the bright characters in it"
3,Overhyped,"No, I'm not going to commit the cardinal sin of rating a product down because it didn't match my expectations based on hype. This book simply doesn't stand out: the writing is fairly average, the story derivative, the characters formulaic when they have any dimensionality at all. It reads as a standard mystery, separated into three stories which follow exactly the same plot structure. Because it's the first book in the series I can cut it some slack for this. Day Watch and Twilight Watch, the sequels, can be safely skipped, however, as they also fail to deviate from this algorithmic style of storytelling with the exception of the first story in Day Watch.In general I feel we should be able to expect more from horror/fantasy writing. There's a good deal better to be had in the genre, and lauding this book for the principle reason of its author's nationality does no one any good."
2,Lost in translation,"I was intrigued by this story line before it was translated from Russian to English. I was so eager to read the series that I purchased all the books before starting the first one. This is a decision I DEEPLY REGRET. The fundamental storyline of this series is interesting, but I found the writing style extraordinarily tedious, nonsensical at times, and overall difficult. This may be a result of the translation, or a simple product of the author's writing style. Either way, I found this book simply terrible. I agree with other reviewers: this book is unlike anything you're likely to have read. It was absolutely not for me, and I wasted the money on the remaining books in the series that I now have no desire to waste any time reading."
2,Amazon Verified Buyer--I Just Don't Get The Rave Reviews!,"I read a lot of books of every genre. I bought this whole series based on the reviews (I hate to start a series and have to wait on the next book to be written). Honestly, I just don't get the rave reviews for this series, let alone this particular book. I was very disappointed. I barely managed to make it through this book--it was BORING, not to mention convoluted. Maybe I'll take another look, and try to figure out what I'm missing, if I can stay awake while reading it.I won't go into the plot since everyone else has done so to a remarkable extent."
1,What Were They Smoking?,"What were those folks smoking who gave this book and it's companion piece, ""Day Watch"" great reviews? Based on those responses I bought both books and was sorely disappointed. Be warned, this IS a translation, and not infrequently the translational errors are so bad as to be funny.Translations are not the best form to critique a book from, but not knowing Russian... ANYWAY, the books' premise will not surprise anyone who has read the Anita Blake books or the like; good versus evil, a bit of metaphysics, brought together in a modern urban environment. So far so good, but the writing, plotting, characterization and so on seemed, well, simple-minded, pretentious, or just,(sorry), juvenile. The books are not truly novels either, but rather a collection of novellas, the sort of surprise I dislike. I could not believe that books reviewed so highly could be so bad. Save your money and buy Anita Blake or Charlie Huston, or learn Russian."
1,U-G-H! Nothing is lost in translation!,"Pure unadulterated crap. The only reason this horrible garbage went to print in English is that the equally lame movie was funded by Channel 1, Russia.They thought: ""about time we make a Russian sci-fi film... with f/x"". Well they picked the worst schlock tripe novel American-wanna-be-pulp-vampire-fiction.There are so many wonderful Russian sci-fi writers.... but NO, WE HAD TO THE DA NU ONES. 'CAUSE THEY NEW...Mediocraty always stinks. Financially successful mediocraty REAKS."
4,Great book! I recommend it to anyone!,"When I started reading this book, I was expecting it to take itself way too seriously, but was delighted to find that it has a sense of humor too. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and Supernatural and all those other vampire-slaying, demon-vanquishing things. It also reminded me a lot of X-Men for some reason.Excellent read!"
5,Highly recommeded to sci-fi readers,"This has been the most creative piece of fiction I've read in a long time. Even though it is an English translation, the ideas and concepts that dance around in the story comes through clear. The conversations between characters remind me of Anne Rice's existential plots in her vampire chronicles. The Russian background of the story is an added gem for those (like me) who know next to nothing about modern Russia. I couldn't put down this book because every sentence hooked me and I just needed to know what would happen next. Book series is highly recommended!"
3,So-so,"The first part of the book is very interesting and original. I assume this is the portion the movie was based off of (which is nothing like the book). The second part is okay, but not great. The last part is really just kind of dumb. Good idea gone bad. The dialog seems forced at parts and slightly over dramatic. This may be due to the translation or mere cultural difference. Not sure. Honestly, I believe the story fell prey to the blight of this genre: Great ideas, not so great writing. But it's still an interesting read. Glad I read and own it."
2,"Not one of those books that ""grabs you""","OK --so at 200 pages into the novel, one would think that the author would have sufficiently ""hooked"" the reader. I keep trying to make it through this book, but it just doesn't grab me. I could normally read a novel of this length in two days, but this one has been collecting dust on my nightstand for months...It's a shame --I love paranormal series and was hoping this would be a new one to get in to."
4,Interesting Read,"I'm not familiar with modern Russian Authors, the only Russians I read are kierkegaard and Dostoevsky. Lukyanenko's style is most defiantly Russian, like his 19th century counterpart Dostoevsky, Night Watch is dark, funny and fatalistic. If you are expecting a novel with easy answers, and well defined heros, Lukyanenko is not for you. The characters, and division of powers are morally ambiguous, and leave you wondering, who really are the good guys? It is a good literary reflection of the postmodern anti-hero, and how this Western philosophy is developing in post cold-war Russia. While I don't agree with the authors underlying world view, I still greatly appreciate his creative talents. I look forward to reading Day Watch."
5,Simply Amazing,"One of the best books I have read in a long, long time. I found myself connecting with the characters on a level I haven't felt in years. I could not stop thinking about the concepts laid down by the author about the boundary between good and evil. Where does one draw the line for an acceptable means to an end. Within five minutes of finishing this book I had bought the second one. I was so immersed in the world that I just want more."
4,perfect,"book came very very fast. perfect condition even though it was bought as used. couldn't be more happy. still getting into the book on page 82, pretty good so far and heard from a buddy it's supposed to take off pretty soon. all in all i'm very satisfied"
3,Was a cheap fabric,I love Elliott Smith and I bought this shirt and my shirt has a hole at the bottom after only having it for a few months . The fabric is very poor quailty and cheap. But I like the design on it though..
3,Not what I thought,"I had the same expectations as Joey, thinking this would be Michael Jr's comedy skits. It details his travels and the hurting people that he encounters. It is good coverage of his work. But it's not a comedy."
2,Comedy was good,I got this for the comedy... And he was very good. But the other part (75%) was a documentary. About him
2,Misleading,I was under the impression because the video was presented as a comedy that it was indeed a comedy. This is more like a personal documentary and is not comical or funny nor is the subject matter. I feel it is a bit misleading.
5,Great doll!!,"My niece loved this doll!!! Well made, very soft, and easy to love. Gives great comfort to her as well!"
5,Perfect Dolly!,"Perfect best friend. My daughter has had one of these dolls since she was born and it's been through everything. We wash it at least every other day and the doll has held up VERY well. I ordered this one as a replacement doll for ""just in case"" since she's so attached and so far she's holding up just as well as the first doll."
3,"A Fine, But Brief, Intro To US Early Childhood Ideals and Philosophy","The NCEDL (like the NAEYC, NIEER, and FPG CDRC) always puts forth a well researched and scholarly written book regardless of the topic; therefore, those accolades need no redundancy.On the other hand, this text offers nothing new except for its streamlined style. You can find this information (economics, child care policy, curriculum issues, etc.) in many other books.However, as an institutionally produced book, you will get added integrity in this one."
3,Scholarly but dull,"I'm sure this must be a very scholarly review of all the available information concerning the various legends that have comprised Robin Hood. But it is deadly dull for the average person to read. I got about 1/3 of the way in before I gave up. I do not have the stamina to keep reading. So the three stars is for the content but for my enjoyment it is 2 or even 1. Sorry, I had hoped for a much more readable and enjoyable book."
5,The best is unseen,"This is a great compilation of re-worked tracks from their 2 previous albums ""like stars in my hands""(not listed on Amazon) and ""exorcise the wasteland"". If you love this album then you've just got to get your hands on ""Flow, river of my soul"".... The cool beats, ethic samples, great vocals and lyrics make this an album one you just want to play again and again."
2,"First side bad, second side OK","This was originally released as a CD and LP in 1985. It is 40 minutes long. There is a new remastered version, with extra tracks and bonus CD that is a Bruford infomercial.On the original LP, the two sides were completely different. Side A was a waste, and Side B was OK. It is all piano and drum music.The music on side A is peppy little ditties. Some of it sounds like circus music, other parts like what would be in a rodeo or for a Western movie. It's all just a bunch of silly inconsequential bits. Maybe something you would hear at a childrens concert.Things are better on the second side. There are some nice little drum solos from Bruford and piano solos from Moraz. Then there some very good discordant piano/drum duets.I bought the new remastered version of this CD based on the rave reviews given on Amazon. I am not too happy about it.Be warned, that most of the CD is not what you would expect from Moraz, and mostly not like what Bruford has done before."
2,Only 1:58 of one Delerue`s most sensitive scores?!!,"This CD disappoints big-time. Instead of a generous representation of Georges Delerue`s beautiful, sensitive background score, we get lots of boring vocal tracks by Midler !! The least the producers could have done is give us a few more tracks of the heart-wrenching music by Maestro Delerue."
5,marvelous.... will anyone sell this CD ?,I had this recording on vinyl... and want it on CD because I love it....please contact ignace@goplay.com

3,"Destined for mass appeal, but nothing you haven't heard before","I picked this album up today, never having heard of Rocco DeLuca or The Burden, but a sticker on the album cover invited favorable comparisons to Jeff Buckley.Needless to say, this album nowhere near approaches the brilliance of Jeff Buckley, although I can hear why people made the comparison. However, Jeff Buckley was much darker lyrically, and was much more into creating atmospherics with music than you will find on this album. Jeff Buckley was also much more diverse musically, sampling influences as diverse as Nasrat Fateh Ali Khan, Nina Simone, Bob Dylan and Led Zeppelin. This is a more conventional, alternative-rock set.Rocco DeLuca really has a lot more in common with, say, Ben Harper. Lyrically, they are very similar, and seem to have similar influences. It's not bad - he's clearly a very gifted musician, and everything here is tasteful, it's just not very profound or different."
5,Guitar with an attitude...,"RDB back in Denver 10/06 AMAZING as ever.......The album was great but the true appreciation is to see them LIVE..... If you get a chance, SEE this band......!When they opened for Life House in Denver, I did not want them to stop. They rocked the house. Awesome sound, lyrics and percussion. Rocco's Vocals topped it all off. This band is not all hype, true blue musicians who learned their licks from older generations for sure. Loved Em ... So will you!!!"
4,A Fun Ride!,"Just overwhelmingly enjoyable. The highlights are the guitar work from Rocco and his voice which is light and expressive. The songcraft is quite good, as well. This all compelled me to YouTube to find the magic 'Live' from Rocco. It was unfortunately not evident there. Thus, the studio musicians and the production on this album are BIG keys to its playability. Highly recommended."
4,About time!,"Regardless of the hype involving Keifer Sutherland and late night tv appearances for this number, I expect a good album to affect me in a way independent of label or connection. I begrudgingly admit this one does. From the first track on through the entirety, I was surprised by the dexterity of a rather humbly broadcasted CD. The Burden and Co. are fairly new, but the appeal is broad. It's a breathy mix of Coldplay, Incubus, and a bit of old word Indie sound that makes a good sing along as well as a disc I could excitedly say, ""Here, listen!"" without later being embarrassed. None of the songs come off as filler and the variety in melody and approach keep it from being bland or like six bowls of similar musical soup. I would gladly recommend this to someone looking for a mellow experimental sound mixed with tremulous effect and raw talent and bark at them to snatch this up. It's well worth the minutes spent hearing it."
5,Original,"In a time where music seems to be nothing but ""cookie cutter"" music along comes Rocco Deluca & the Burden. Not only is his music original, he also has a great and powerful voice. A must buy."
2,Same as every other band out right now,"First of all, I bought this POS because I thought the song that the album was named after would be on the album. That guy Rocco can PLAY! He just doesn't do it on this album. Besides swing low, every song is the same whiny 14 year old girl BS that every other band on the radio sounds like. What a waste of talent. Save yourself the money and just listen to any other whiny non-original music that has dominated the ""rock"" stations for the past 5 years. I thought I was going to hear a more blues/rock kind of stuff but they are exactly like everyone else."
2,Much Ado About Very Little,Rocco Deluca combines the most memorable characteristics of three legendary talents:George Michael's beard.Fonzie's jacket.Barney the dinosaur's lyric sheet.
5,"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, NO JAPANESE","I study languages (including Mandarin and Japanese) so I was excited to see that this DVD had a few language options. I don't have any Disney movies in Japanese so I bought it mostly for that. It looked like a great DVD when it arrived, but when I put it in the DVD player there was no Japanese! If you think you might want to buy it because you want the Japanese option, look away! You'll have to get that elsewhere. But the Mandarin version is good, and it's a fun movie for the whole family."
4,FAKE,"i bought the DVD Bambi in Aug '10, I have been working on collecting Disney DVDs for when I have children and I felt the urge this morning (Feb '12) to watch Bambi (with my schedule, sitting down and watching Disney movies (let alone any TV) does not happen often) and was very disappointed to see that the DVD I had gotten was a fake... NOT factory sealed like it was listed and had very bad spotting on the back of both discs, they are unwatchable and I am now out $25. if you don't care about fake and illegal movies then go ahead and buy, but i would NOT take your chances!after contacting the seller, they very willingly and graciously are sending me a replacement for my product.... THANK YOU!"
4,FIRST DVD PURCHASE,This is the first dvd I've bought from Amazon. It was an easy process....I was able to use reward points from a credit card....the quality was excellent (new).....the price great....no shipping cost........and it arrived in a few days from the date I ordered it......Very convenient....I am extremely satisfied and will order more dvds this way.......
2,Bambi,"Like the other reviewers this Bambi product was not described as being in a non-English version. However, upon receiving the item and discovering this I at least received a quick response after emailing the company and they told me where to return it for a full refund. I did receive a full refund shortly after. Therefore I'm giving them 2 stars - if I was able to rate the different aspects of the transaction separately I would've given them 0 stars for clarity/accuracy in item description. I'd have to give 0 stars just for the hassle and taking up of my time to deal with this as well. But I would give them 5 stars for customer service for prompt response in communication and in crediting and making things right."
5,Its a classic,"This movie is great! I loved it when I was a kid,and i still do. I don't think there is a need to explain the plot or story line pretty much everyone knows it and is familiar with it. I own this movie and it is a wonderful addition to to our collection. You simply cant beat a classic it will never out grow the youth of this world. Parents that dont let their kids watch these classic Disney movies are taking away their precious childhood.. I mean kids shouldn't be couch potatoes but ya i digress. Watch it with your kids, they will love it! Highly Recommended!"
5,Bambi,"I think that this was a great movie, it came earlyer then the arrivl date and it was in a great condition. Also I look forward to watching it again in the future."
3,A little surprised.,"The movie itself is fine, however the entire cover is in japanese! I was not aware of that when i purchased the movie because nothing was said about it being in japanese. If you're fine with that issue it's not a bad deal."
5,A Great Movie,"This is a great movie with which you can wind your kids down. I like to put it on before bedtime. Most of the movie is slow and serene, but heart-warming at the same time. There are layers of lessons to be learned, all of which come through very well."
3,Too violent for toddlers!,"I bought this DVD for my two and half year old son and was horrified to see how violent it is. Bambi's mother is murdered by hunters, dogs maul deers, animals are burned in fires, deers fight and birds are shot. I know all the arguments about tapping into the fears of children, but in this case, I feel this movie creates, rather than taps into those fears. Stick to films like Dumbo or Nemo, which manage to communicate similar ideas in a less brutal manner."
2,Perhaps not for Kids !,I bought this movie and had my three plus yr old watch it and I couldn't believe how terrified he was. I had to keep forwarding the scary scenes. I had no idea this was such an old movie. The music sounds like church music and is not something I consider for kids (Remember it is rated G). The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so. I think this is an age old format of story telling which needs to revised. Unfortunately Disney keeps repeating it through movies like Incredibles.
2,Save your Money,"Even though the Blu-ray release is spectacular in it's color reproduction, it is not in a screen filling format, but in a square box format. The DVD version played on a Blu-ray player is -almost- on par with the Blu-ray Disk version. Save your money and keep the DVD version."
5,Bambi (2-Disc Special Platinum Edition),Bambi is a classic story that makes you laugh and cry. The DVD arrived inexcellent condition and plays great. I am very happy with my copy of Bambi.
5,One of disney's classic!!,"Great movie, loved it when I was a little kid. Had it on tape, but I lost it. Remastered version looks so much better. Bambi is a must in your movie collection.Worth buying!!"
5,Disney's second best animated feature,"Just a notch below the legendary Snow White sits the timeless, sweeping beauty and simplicity of Bambi. Sporting an incredible new transfer this edition shines light years beyond the previous VHS incarnation. Colors appear slightly brighter and the soundtrack rings crystal clear. The extras on this platinum edition are varied and quite enjoyable as well w/the OLD MILL short animated short being my favorite. Another 1 hr and 10 min extra delves deep into the meetings and processes that formed this classic. Deeper than most Disney films and second only to Snow White sits this incredible testament to animation and Walt Disney's genius."
5,My Very Favorite From Childhood!,This was and still is my favorite Disney classic. I remember the shock I went into when Bambi's mother was killed. Each time I watch it with my grandchildren I still hope that maybe it won't happen this time around.;-) A must for any Disney lover!!!!
4,okay,"I couldn't tell from the picture that all writing on the case was in a different language. Luckily, the movie was in English and my nephew is not old enough to read yet, therefore, could care less about the cover. Aside from the writing, the movie was inexpensive and high quality. It has been watched a million times! Overall, good deal."
2,Bambi DVD,The Bambi DVD did not work on all DVD players.We gave it as a gift and it wouldn't work on their player.I sent an E-Mail to try and contact the supplier to return product.So far I have not received a response.
3,unhappy,Something is wrong with the DVD to where the dvd freezes at the end when Bambi is in the fight with the other deer. It's been forever since I've seen the movie and I don't even remember and will never know how it ended. Everything was fine until that point.
1,Artistry Lost,"Our family was disappointed by the so-called ""restoration"" of the original classic. The colors now look very unnatural and the original appearance of the beautiful watercolor wash technique is gone. When the original movie was made, the Disney animators sought to create a specific look, full of graceful lines, subtle tones, and naturalistic color. I would hope that the original films could be put on DVD without all the computer-generated color ""fill-in"". We also returned our copy due to it being a bootleg (with flaws; it only played once and looked to be manufactured overseas), so be cautious about what Amazon seller you purchase it from."
5,"A Masterpiece, made even better.","This is the third incarnation of ""Bambi"" on video, but the first time on DVD. The last VHS presentation showed the film in a digitally spruced up version, but the new version on DVD is a miracle of restoration - an inspired release.Seldom - or perhaps never - has Hollywood ever given us a more beautiful motion picture, one that is the embodiment of innocence and love. The opening sequence, displaying superb use of Disney Studios' Multi-Plane Camera, is worth the price of the DVD alone.The 53-minute documentary, ""The Making of Bambi"", goes far deeper than ever before in showing how difficult it was to get ""Bambi"" released during a time of world war and union strikes, and how people of the day did not appreciate this masterpiece in the way it would later be embraced for all time.As mentioned in books and on the VHS releases, Walt Disney himself considered ""Bambi"" his ""personal favorite"". After experiencing this DVD release, it's little wonder why he felt that way."
5,Good Classic Childrens Movie.,"This movie is a good movie, would not really recommend it for little kids because of bambi's mother dying but for a little bit older kids 7-10 it is a good movie."
1,Bambi 2 disc DVD,"The disc with the feature presentation was delivered with existing damage. We were never able to watch the entire picture straight through since it would stop halfway through the movie and remain still or skip continuously. Unfortunately, the scratch is deep so it is unrepairable and cannot be remedied with cleaning. My daughter is pretty upset that she cannot watch it all the way through. It was a bummer for us all."
2,lost in translation,"the movie was, and always has been, great. the condition in which i recieved it was not. i mistakenly bought it from a dealer and not directly from amazon and it was put in a bubble manilla envelope, the discs had creases in them and were unreadable by my blu ray player and my playstation"
3,WHAT?!,"the package came in a timely manner, but its a 2 disc deluxe set and only one disc was there...what happened to the other one?? this is my absolute favorite movie and now i can share it with this generation on DVD, so i am happy i purchased it"
5,Great service,"I was very happy w/ the fast service,the movie is of good quality,my grandchildren have really enjoyed it. Would highly recommend."
2,Lack of ENGLISH,"The movie was alright, but was greatly disappointed in the fact that it was spoken in Koran instead of English. If anyone buys this product, besure you check out the language first."
5,Flawless!!!,"Thank you, Walt Disney Studios for finally releasing Bambi on DVD!!! A beautiful and lavish restoration indeed. The documentaries on both discs really give you a closer look at how the whole project came to be.Can't wait for Cinderella to be released in October 2005!"
3,Bambi's blu-ray too modern,Love the movie but the blu-ray proved to be too technically advanced for my Sumsung blu-ray player. Returned the first copy b/c it would not play on my player. The second disc that arrived did the same thing. My player is only a couple years old but the technology has already surpassed it. The digital copy played very well but have not be able to view the blu-ray version so I have no opinion on that.
1,Bambi,We ordered the video - received in Korean. No where in the description did any thing mention the video was not in English. The video was a copy ------ a bad copy. Highly recommend no one order from this merchant. Had to file a claim to get the money refunded --lost the money spent for shipping from the merchant and had to pay out of pocket to have the video returned to the merchant. Merchant name -- Import DVD's
1,Very poor quality and in the Korean language,Don't waste your money on this poorly produced and obviously pirated copy of Bambi. It is not even in English. I contacted Moviemars for full refund. Their response clearly indicated there will be no refund but they were sorry for my frustration. The picture is grainy and the colors dim. It was a huge disappointment. I will never buy from Moviemars again. They have a bad customer service attitude!!! They misrepresent their product and they are rip offs!!
3,drags a little towards the end.....,"I actually ended up giving away my copy. Its still a classic and the picture looks good with the color restore but I feel when Bambi was little is the best part of the flick, after that it tends to get a little boring."
2,Really - some people have got some nerve!,"I can take it when someone says that the movie 'Bambi' is boring and so on, but I can NOT take it when that person goes as far as to accuse parents who show it to kids of bad parenting, and so on. Apparently, some people have some problem against being sad when an animal dies. It's retarded for a kid to cry when a mother deer dies? Please... Me? I just don't like this movie. Anyways, the DVD sucks, but if you like it, you can get it."
3,Greatest Disney animation; worst Disney film transfer,"Why does such a wonderful film have to be disgraced by allowing such a flawed copy to be offered on VHS? Endless spots, faded colors, and washed out backgrounds. Let's hope they get it right on the DVD release."
4,My daughter wouldn't stop asking for this.,My six year old daughter would not stop asking for this. She watched it once and has not asked to watch it again. It is a very sad movie and not as much fun as most of her other Disney movies.
5,terrific,The DVD was shipped quickly and packaged in the appropriate material to secure it. the item was exactly as described.
2,Unwatchable,"The product arrived promptly and was packaged nicely. But upon playing the DVD, the product was damaged. The video skipped, jumped, stopped, even after trying to clean it. Definitely the product was not in good shape. We enjoyed the first 15 minutes but then the action stopped and we could not get it to play. We and our grandchildren were disappointed."
1,Unusable,Disc was so dirty and stained the player could not read it. Also second disc was missing Had to send it back..
3,Hard to rate,"Again, this was something my mother wanted, so I bought and shipped it to her. I remember this story as a kid, but what grown guy writes a review on Bambi?"
5,a gift for my daughter,This was a gift for my daughter who cried when I gave it to her she always loved the story of Bamby as a child
5,Bambi eyes,what's not to love. Such a classic Disney movie had to join my collection. Shipped immediately! No complaints love it!
5,Bambi,"I have to admit that although the video was in great shape, I sure didn't rememberthis movie the way it was. Guess my memory has gotten foggy!! This is the original Bambi. We also have Bambi II, which we enjoy much more than the first Bambi movie. Also the original Bambi did not seem to capture the grandkids attention like Bambi II did."
1,Stay Away!,"Same experience as everyone above - the film is clearly pirated, very poor quality, and in Korean."
2,"Ok - problem with DVD playing, looks pirated","Ok DVD - arrived quickly, however first impression when it arrived was that it was a copy, not original Disney DVD. I had ordered 6 other Disney DVD's, and this one appeared to be a copy - quality of cover wasn't the same, didn't come with all the Disney flyers inside (every other one did). Upon playing the DVD, there is one part where the movie stops, as if paused, except the DVD machine keeps playing as if there is movie playing. Appears to be corrupted. If the DVD had cost less, this may have been more acceptable. Overall not happy, wouldn't order again from this supplier."
3,Bambi DVD Extremely slow,"The DVD is extremely slow moving from one pre-movie item (e.g. previews, warnings,Disney credits) to the next and very slow to respond to ""play"""
2,Bambi,This video freezes in several different scenes. I am quite disappointed in the quality because it was stated that it was in very good condition. I will probably not purchase another used video through Amazon.
1,Bambi,I am very disappointed I was in believe that this was the original Bambi but it isn't even USA copy this isn't even new I'll never trust this again this isn't even by Disney bad bad bad!!!!!!
1,very dissapointed,do not ever order from these people it is in korean and they do not state this on the site. they take your money thinking youre getting the bambi movie and then you cant watch it cuz your not korean. im sending mine back and getting one elsewhere!!! very unhappy they misrepresent.
5,Very best of Fleetwood Mac CD,"The CD is wonderful and brings back my memories in college. Everywhere I have seen it, the CD is over 20 dollars (brand new). Has the very best songs and trust me, buy it and you'll see...."
4,"Great CD, hard to find in stores.","Although I love almost all the major hits Fleetwood Mac has released, there are four that I absolutely had to have on the same album. I looked at their other Greatest Hits and live albums but none had all the songs I wanted. This was the only collections that had pretty much everything I love about Fleetwood Mac."
4,Great Mac Collection!,Simply put: this has all my favorites and a few more that I have either forgotten about or are just getting to know which are also very good!
4,Good Album,"I bought this CD to add the classic Fleetwood Mac songs to my playlist. If your looking for a good collection of the best songs by the band, this is a no-brainer."
3,Doesn't go far enough back,"Simply put, the collection is not as complete as it could be. Where is Bare Trees? Any Fleetwood Mac that does not contain that song or material from the album of the same name can not is lacking."
2,Ridiculous Collection,"In case anyone is wondering, there was a Fleetwood Mac before the Buckingham/Nicks era, although you'd never know it from this collection. Where is ""Oh Well,"" ""The Green Manalishi,"" ""Jewel Eyed Judy,"" ""Future Games?"" Geez, where's ""Station Man,"" fer cryin' out loud?!! The Very Best of FM? I guess this must be someone's idea of a bad joke. I'm not laughing."
3,Where's the Classic?,"When i purchased this cd, at first glance i saw all the great tracks ands immediatly parted with my money, but when i got home i realised to my shock that the greatest fleetwood mac song(possibly of all time?) was not on it! Where is ""Man Of The World""? How can you call this a greatest hits without it? also missing is ""The Boy Is Crackin Up"", although i'm not a very big fan of that song, but still..i mean, c'mon!"
5,Mick Fleetwood is a genius!,Mick Fleetwood is a genius! First Mick Fleetwood started one of the greatest blues bands in the world with Peter Green on guitar & vocals. That line up i think would of been bigger then Eric Clapton would of ever been but out of nowhere Peter leaves the band & Mick Fleetwood gets a new line up that is completely different musically & sells more albums then they could of ever dreamed & you have all of that line up's collection here. Great remastered version to replace my old 1 cd greatest hits with. This 2 cd set is all stellar stuff but the sound is so much more audiophile like. Crystal clear audio quality very up front & so much better then the old one that i have replaced.There are so many songs where they play soft & it's so clear it's like your in the sound room with them. All i can say is go ahead & get it nothing sounds better.
3,Long awaited collection but not all that good,"Fleetwood Mac's classic lineup (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood) was one of the best pop/rock acts of the 70's and 80's. There is plenty of great material on the this latest complilation; however, there is the overall feeling that this two disc issue was padded with quite a bit of mediocre to poor material. The song order was also not well selected. For example, you can find almost all of the songs from the classic Rumours album, but they are scattered randomly over two discs which contain too many obscure songs from Tusk, too many inferior live songs from The Dance and not enough songs from the underappreciated Mirage album. It would have made more sense to put together a single disc compilation with more judicious choosing of songs. The double disc format simply clutters up the good material."
2,What a joke,"Ok, first off, I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan. If these cd's were called ""The best of the new Fleetwood Mac"", then fine. But let's look at just some of the great Green/ Welch songs that are left off this collection:Black Magic Woman, Rattlesnake Shake, Green Manalishi, Man of the World, Albatross, Need Your Love So Bad, Sandy Mary, Hypnotyzed, Sentimental Lady, Angel, Why, Jumping at Shadows, Oh Well, Heroes Are Hard to Find...At least some of these songs should have been put on the album, or else it's just a bogus best-of Fleetwood Mac. Don't get me wrong though, I love the newer lineup too, and I'm sure that these cd's are good :-) But it's just not really the best of Fleetwood Mac."
4,Early Mac,A great album but I would like to hear the early Mac tunes of Peter Green and Bob Welch. I have not found any compilation that contains these songs.
4,All the big ones,"For my sometimes-deejay library, I took all but two of my Fleetwood Mac tunes from this CD. One of those two tunes was a studio version of ""Big Love"" rather than the live version on this CD. I took the studio version from the Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits CD. The other tune was ""Diane"", a fifties-sounding tune that didn't chart in the US but went to No. 9 in the UK. I downloaded that from iTunes.The tracks on this CD seemed to be generally compressed, something that doesn't always make me happy. There also could have been better volume balancing within some tracks, and some of the fade outs seemed a bit long.My impression of Fleetwood Mac was definitely increased after reviewing their tunes. They displayed a lot of creative effort."
4,Great addition to your Fleetwood Mac collection,"This CD is wonderfully put together. Although there are plenty of the ""popular songs"" that make it on all their greatest hits albums, there is enough material that you don't often hear to make this CD a must-have."
3,Almost...,"Another great compilation, but very disappointed that the 'hit' version of ""BIG LOVE"" is not included and would have rather had the versions of ""LANDSLIDE"" & ""SILVER SPRINGS"" from the 1997 album ""The Dance"". Both had a lot of airplay, yet were passed over for their 70's versions.The songs that are here are excellent though. Very pleasantly surprised about the different mixes of ""OVER MY HEAD"", ""RHIANNON"" & the great but often overlooked ""SISTERS OF THE MOON""."
5,classic rock at it's finest,"Any Fleetwood Mac fan could easily burn themselves a replica of this collection using previously released material from the boxed set, import singles, and earlier album releases. But to have it delivered in a nice package with bonus video material is a great thing for fans old and new.Yet another testament as to why this group of hyper-talented musicians has managed to stand the test of time - over and over again. Apparently their new studio album due next year is groundbreaking work - in the same vein as the best tracks on the Tusk album. Until then, enjoy this nice reminder of what FM radio was like back in the day"
5,The 'Nearly' Complete Set,"I've always been happy with my Fleetwood Mac Box Set (4 discs; 72 songs) and the 1990 Greatest Hits. But this double CD collection has sixteen more songs than the one from fourteen years prior. These include such unforgettable classics like, ""Monday Morning"", ""Silver Springs"", ""Landslide"", ""Think About Me' and ""Gold Dust Woman"". ""Family Man"" and ""Big Love (live)"" are some clever Buckingham numbers, but not great. The videos on this Double CD are nice to watch, but one viewing will be all you'll probably need. Still, with the complete and exhaustive Box Set hard to find (and expensive), this surpasses the 1990 Greatest Hits collection by far. This is much more for the average interested fan, but also required for the collector - so it works for everyone."
5,Great collection!,"Just put it on and sing along. I have always been a fan of Fleetwood Mac and this is a great collection. Lots of favorites all together without having to change records, tapes or discs. No long description of it's attributes are needed. You don't have to be a musical expert to appreciate it."
5,Absolutely everything,"I bought this when I realized I loved seven songs on it--and then after a week of listening I liked (pretty much) all of them. I float back to 1975...even though I was born in 1984! Fleetwood Mac have always been a wonderful mix of folk, rock and...something else. There's a song for everyone on this album, and I can't recommend this little piece of rock history enough.Favorite picks: ""Landslide"" (Of course) ""Songbird,"" ""Go your own way"" ""Little Lies"" ""Gold Dust Woman"" and the Lyndsy Buckingham live version of ""Go Insane"""
3,Enjoyable Half of Fleetwood Mac,"This is an excellent compilation of the ""late"" Fleetwood Mac - from Rumours onward. If you like the Buckingham-Nicks era, you won't be disappointed. But as often seems the case, the Green-Spencer-Kirwan-Welch lineups have been ignored, making this only half of the superb retrospective it could have been. If you're looking for ""Oh Well"", ""Black Magic Woman"", ""Bare Trees"", ""Woman of 1,000 Years"", or ""Hypnotize"", you'll still need to buy the original albums. Although the sound was very different (not better, not worse) once Buckingham and Nicks joined the band, Fleetwood Mac fans deserve the full range of the greatest hits."
5,Quintessential... For the First Timer or the Forever Fan!,"This has to be one of the best compilations ever made! The simple fact that Sara is on CD 1 says it all. This is the best mixture of classic fleetwood mac hits as well as the highly treasured album tracks that we have grown to love. I think this is a great cd to get someone familiar with Fleetwood Mac. The double cd set make look a bit comprehensive to a new listener, but whats so hard about listening to somethin you will instantly love?CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM TO DROP SPRING 2003!"
1,Not for your portable device,Might be a great album but you will listen to it on a CD/DVD/BluRay player or not at all. Apparently has a poison pill in it with all the extra crap to prevent ripping to MP3. Tried three rippers; no luck. I personally find this flaw to be fatal.
2,Should have been great but... they really messed it up,"Wow this should have been one of the best collections of all time. There is enough great Fleetwood Mac material to fill at least 2 CDs -- but for some reason they included many bad versions of really bad songs (they don't have many bad songs after all) and left off many graet ones. Where is Angel (their best song) and we certainly don't need the live version of Lindsay Buckingham ruining I'm So Afraid. And how could they include the really bad obnoxious live version of Big Love? It is horrible. Since when is What Makes You Think You're The One the best of Fleetwood Mac - IT IS TERRIBLE. The live version of Go Insane is unlistenable (and isn't even a Fleetwood Mac song!!!!!) Other bad songs include: World Turning, Family Man (one of their worst songs), As Long As You Follow, No Questions Asked, and Skies The Limit are really really really BAD. This should have been awesome instead it is very very mediocre and unlistenable at times. What a shame!"
5,Greeeeeeeeeeeeeaaat!,This CD is incredable for any Fleetwood Mac fans! and if you really love Fleetwood Mac come check out this Fan Chain! ...
3,"Bad Sequencing, Unnecessary Live Cuts","I love FM. I'm not an avid fan, but a casual one. After purchasing this, I have to say that the original 1988 GH set is the far superior one. At least with that release, one has a single disc and can sequence the songs into a chronological order if one wishes. Many folks like to see an artist develop over time with a GH set, not sequence the tracks scatter-shot, as if it's a concert set-list.The live tracks are totally unnecessary here as they have already been released on a live album, where they belong.The non-hit tracks here are good, but could easily be heard on an additional disc-""Fan Favorites"" or some such title. Put the hits on one disc, hopefully sequenced chronologically and the fan faves on another for a double disc treat. Then, everyone's happy. :)Tony"
2,Not all the best by far....,"I don't blame the other reviewers for gushing over this collection, which is fine if the only Fleetwood Mac songs you like come from Nicks-Buckingham and later periods, but any ""greatest hits"" collection of this band that omits selections from the Welch period (Such as ""Hypnotized"") isn't going to win many stars from me. I'm sticking with the box set ""The Chain"" which unfortunately isn't easy to find anymore but which is the REAL five star greatest hits collection of this fine band."
5,Great Overview,"I truly dig Fleetwood Mac.they have made some truly tight Songs over the years.""Don't Stop"" is a Classic that just gets better with time.""Landslide"" is a Classic for me as well.Hold Me,Sara,Tusk, all are tight songs.this is a Solid Collection for New Fans&a Great Overview."
5,The perfect gift for a Fleetwood Fan,"My husband enjoys music, all kinds and was a big fan of Fleetwood Mac. After hearing a song of theirs on an Oldies Station, he looked on Amazon to see if he could find any of their albums in CD form. He did and decided this would be the best one, full of all his favorite songs. He put it on his wish list. When I purchased it the delivery was quick and he loves it."
4,Great but not really the best they have to offer,"Save Me, Tango in the Night, That's Alright are not part of this album. Instead we get No Questions Asked, Skies the Limit and Paper Doll-Yuck! Save Me was their only hit from Behind the Mask and it's not here. I hate when artists do this. If they're gonna say the ""Very Best of"" it better be. It must be a royalty thing, or a marketing strategy. Hell, Stevie put Whole Lotta Trouble, Desert Angel and Loves a Hard Game to Play on her Greatest Hits and they weren't even hits. She managed to leave off Nightbird and After the Glitter Fades. I was upset. Seven Wonders wasn't on the Macs first greatest hits.However, this still manages to be a great album only because their worst songs are a level higher than most artists best."
3,Good Info,Useful information without a lot of reading. Reasonable value for the price and most likely all you will need. oasdf
2,"Same old, same old","This is a superficial review of several of the early civilizations around the world. The title is misleading - instead of ""First cities"" this book should be called ""Early civilizations,"" since the focus is on entire civilizations/cultures and not on cities or urban settlements per se. The coverage of cities and urbanism is superficial and brief. As a review of early civilizations, the book covers the same material found in many other books, with little that is new or interesting. There are few errors of fact."
3,old english,"The book is interesting, but a little hard to read due to the use of old english. This is a book to take a little at a time."
5,Intelligent,It's amazing to see how the world has not changed when it comes to the personality of human nature. These words of wisdom from the past speak as if they were meant for all time.
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"Either these aphorisms do not translate well into English, or there is not much here. A third possibility is that I just did not ""get them.""Whatever is the correct interpretation, it remains my assessment that while it is not necessary that all nuggets of wisdom be hopeful, bright and light, they also should not maintain a wordy, clumsy, whiny, menacing -- having an almost forced Machiavellian air about them -- either. While I cannot deny that there is some wisdom buried here beneath the wordiness, I have seen it better stated almost everywhere else.The roughness of the translation into a kind of ""faux old English"" also probably did not help the understanding much. Instead of giving them (the intended) air of profundity and eruditeness, it made them seem gratuitously heavy, pedantic, cold and emotionless, as if they had been an edict promulgated down from a Catholic Monastery.To put it mildly, this collection was not my cup of tea. One star."
1,master of wordly wisdom,"Having read this book in various editions I was looking forward to have 3 copies for presents to good friends. It was however an edition that is a shame to the wilder Co. A piece of special age old wisdom turned into an uninspired , unatractive and utterly confusion nonsense. Waste basket or recycling bin"
3,Fascinating but often unintelligable,"This is a beautifully produced book, and on the whole the translation is at least satisfactory, and frequently elegant in its own right. But the oracle's original train of thought within each half-page aphorism (probably hard enough to follow in the original Spanish) often becomes totally unintelligable in translation.Perhaps annotations would have helped, but without either the original Spanish or any notes to refer to one sometimes has to simply give up trying to understand the gist, and move on to the next aphorism.Overall it's a rewarding read, and certainly a book to keep at hand and dip into again and again, but also somewhat frustrating. This is not the ultimate translation."
3,Cold Pak,"The cold pak last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours, not bad for a little 8 oz.. The Medicool Dia Pak Baf itself doen't not fair as well, maybe I just got a bad one. I have one had it for a liitle over a week and it is coming apart."
2,After Hours sounds like an after-thought...,"This CD is adequate music, of course. It's title is meant to play on the old jazzclub vibe, when in fact, all the performances are recent recordings by mid-level artists who do not evoke anything LIKE the atmosphere as advertised. Read the track list, and see how many names you might recognize. Right,one, maybe. So,now you know that what you are getting is actually a new artists sampler. As such the CD is OK. IF you want classic jazz, look for the Original Jazz Classics CD's.88melter"
2,Not Much New Info,"I was disappointed that there was little new information from his last book. Most of the additional machines he listed were clearly not played much by him and he did not include information that I felt was reliable. Using the methods in his last book, I had some good luck, but some of his advice on certain machines clearly did not work and he did not make adjustments based on what the casinos have done. Unfortunately, the opportunity to profit from banking machines has nearly gone away and perhaps these books are part of the reason."
2,Old time advice,"With so many casinos going to the new digital machines, this book is out of date. It is harder and harder to find the ""old time"" slots. I do to slots in Las Vegas and Metropolis, IL and line up 3 row machines are almost relics."
3,difficult to read,"This does have great tips on grammar; however, some of the book is definitely outdated. Also, it seems to me that this type of book would be written primarily for those of us who aren't naturally adept in English usage -- if that is the case, I think the author should remember the KISS rule (Keep it simple, stupid) and avoid sentences like this one in chapter 13: ""A false comparison is one wherein a comparative or a superlative degree construction is used without a clearly stated basis for the comparison..."" . Who needs to muddle through sentences like that! Otherwise, though, this book can be very helpful."
3,The Most Common Mistakes in English Usage,The product was about what I expected for a book this old. I would have liked to have seen a sample page to preview but it was not available. I teach ESL classes and I thought that this book would highlight some of the problems that those students have. It seems to fit the that idea. I was pleased with the purchase and the delivery time.
5,"Excellent product, price and service.","I was having a hard time locating this particular cord due to the unique style and age of the device. I not only got exactly what I wanted, but at a great price, reasonable shipping cost and quick delivery."
4,A great book if you're in a rush,"This is the only book I used to study. I procrastinated and then crammed with this book. It has a chapter for every section of psychology, including those subjects I didn't take in college like comparative psychology, history, and ethology and those subjects I barely remember like history and physiological. This book will highlight ALL the main points of each subject and give tips for the test. You won't have to open another book."
5,This book is all you need!,"I ended up cramming for the GRE Psych test for 2 weeks (instead of the recommended 6 weeks). I only bought Princeton Review's study guide and I pretty much just made sure I knew the info reviewed in it. They divide the info into sections (Memory, Evolutionary, Social, etc.) and gave anywhere from 2-10 pages of information you should know for the test about that particular section. I didn't even look at my intro psych text, or any of my second/third year course textbooks. Well, the study guide must have been worth it, because I got a 700 on the GRE Psych, and other than a few questions on the test, the book prepared you for them."
4,French jazz-rock with a lot of good moments.,"This album gets an unfair treatment in the previous review. The MTV-rotated ""la chambre"" is not typical for this definitely uneven album, but it's actually one of its weakest tracks. Unlike the band's previous recordings, this album's strong, poem-like lyrics are predominantly written in English. Good news for those of us who don't speak French, although singer Rodolphe Burger's pronunciation is as terrible as - well, a Frenchman's. I can't think of any really obvious references to similar sounding artists; Kat Onoma's sound is rather unusual, but names like Morphine, NY-based ""art rock"" band Gunga Din and Finnish mystery-man Jimi Tenor spring to mind. Uneven though it is, the album still is a really good buy. It's laidback, it's groovy and poetic. It's an album to sip a glass of Scotch or smoke a joint to. But if you want it by now, hurry up and buy it, because the French record industry is a mess, and Kat Onoma's early albums are already out of stock!"
2,"Peaks with ""La Chambre"", so avoid paying the Import premium","Disconcertingly uneven, this album recommends itself mainly on the strength of ""La Chambre"" which has been remixed by Kid Loco and has enjoyed some rotation on MTV Europe. Sadly, a nice video and good art direction notwithstanding, the bulk of the album fails to match the oblique and languid seduction of this track, and is not sung in the band's native French, but in an affected rock-English which veers all too close to Johnny Holliday terrain. I do not regret having bought this CD at a normal price in France, but I would caution anyone who has heard and liked ""La Chambre"" against shelling out 24-odd bones."
3,Not too impressed,Its really just another pencil that is made out of plastic. The tip is square until you sharpen it and still its not that easy to correctly sharpen it. Its not all bad though. I just don't think you are missing too much. 3 stars. Another words I went back to using the regular pencils. Might want to just try it though if its for you. I seem not too inclined.
3,Fair,"The book has a lot of useful phrases for dealing with someone until you get a translator. It could really use a pronunciation guide. It is very basic. It is a little outdated and it does not cover any new medical terminolgy that has been in use since the 1980's. You will not find names for new technological instruments just the basic X ray and such. Also, you will not be able to find out how to ask questions that are problems for today. Example, the book tells you how to ask a parent if the child swallowed gasoline or bleach but not new questions for today like ""did your child sniff glue?"" However,for the price and for quick reference, the book served its purpose."
4,"Excellent, quick guide for health care workers.","I took this book to Bolivia, as a non-Spanish speaking medical missionary. Soon I was conversant, at least in the medical clinic. I am now buying a copy for each doctor on our staff, and an extra copy for the E.R."
2,¿Qué pasó? con ¿Qué pasó?,I found this pocket sized book useless and full of gramatical mistakes (for example missing accent marks). It was hard to find what I was looking for as well.
4,Solid and Stylish,"If this isn't my very favorite Steve Kuhn album, it's still very stylish, creative and lovely. It's nice to hear these vets together in live setting and Kuhn remains one of the best unheralded players. Iwould still go first for his trio albums with David Finck and Billy Drummond (mostly on Reservoir I think), or some of the ECM titles for their 'experimentalism.' This one shows another side though. Very fine stuff."
4,a nice evening out,"a light deft touch marks kuhn's style. had me thinking of art tatum and oscar peterson. if i were a bell reminded me of miles' rendition on relaxin' with miles. some other jazz standards, a selection written by kenny dorham, trumpeter, two kuhn originals. one of my favorites, jitterbug waltz by fats waller, has me regretful i was not at birdland the night this was recorded, what a nice night that must had been. and you can't go wrong with al foster and ron carter, little waltz written by carter. a theme of music and flowers, two waltzes, a passion flower and a lotus blossom, in starlight, a slow hot wind blowing. this could be a presumptuous picture in other hands, kuhn, nicely, carries it off."
4,damn good power metal,"If you like power metal mixed with the D&D lyrical world then Pyramaze is a band you really need to listen to. If you like really good guitar and a vocalist with an amazing voice then you need to listen to either this CD or their first, Meloncholy Beast (which I think is even better, and certainly doesn't have as much of the silly lyrics). When I first picked up the Meloncholy Beast I was hesistant because I didn't want to be hearing Helloween or some lightweight Euro-metal (Hey, sorry, it's just not my cup of tea), so I was really pleased at the crunch and melody of the music. Legends of the Bone Carver continues the same sonic territory - nothing new, but that's just fine with me. Buy it, you'll really enjoy it."
4,Actual Rating - 4.5 stars. ( They really need to consider a 1/2 star rating system! ),"The second release by this Danish / American power metal band shows the band improving in both the song writing and the song structuring process. Fantastic guitar work woven in with keyboards ( w/ the guitars at the forefront ), a very capable rythm section, and yet another outstanding vocal performance from Lance King make this album a winner. The pieces of this band are really starting to come together on this album and it shows. Fans of melodic power metal, purchase immediately!"
2,deceptive description,"Condition was listed as Used - Very Good with ""Comments: Dust cover intact and in good condition, 212 pages in great condition."" I would say, dust cover intact but dog-eared and (coffee?) stained. Book has very musty smell."
5,replacement copy,"I liked Warren's early stuff, but this is my absolute favorite from his last years. I love the whole CD and wore out the hockey song."
5,"If you like WZ, don't skip this one","Picked this up when I couldn't get the title tune out of my head after hearing Bruce's cover of it on the Sandwich collection. From the opening blast, there's no duds on this one, even though some of his other CDs are bigger sellers/better known or have more radio hits. Lyrics are as twisted and funny as ever and the players rock. 'Nuff said."
4,What did he know? When did he know it?,"Warren Zevon's recent annoucement of his termnal illness puts this work (and his last - Life'll Kill You) in a whole other realm. His condition seems to have come as a complete surprise on one level. On another level, he was right there.Warren Zevon has been one of the most literary of song writers; a close reading of his lyrics is always worth the extra effort. And whether he's trying to pull you in for a ride on a crazy merry-go-round leading you for a grasp at the cynical brass ring, or coming straight for your soul with a bullet of pure ""Empty Handed Heart"" feeling, he's always had the goods.Warren has long history of collaborative song writing, and in My Ride's Here he's dialoging with some great writers on what's coming up soon for him, and only a little later for the rest of us. Grace and humor under pressure. Start here and work your way back through the catalog; you can't go wrong."
3,Not Warren's best -- and the sound?,"I had been eagerly awaiting this release since seeing Warren at the House of Blues in Anaheim last year, where he played a ... version of ""Sacrificial Lambs"" and generally sounded terrific. The CD, however, was somewhat disappointing. Warren gave a lot of the writing over to his friends and the lyrics are uneven. Hunter Thompson may be my favorite writer, but the lyrics for ""You're a Whole Different Person When You're Scared"" just don't cut it.The big disappointment, though, was the SOUND. This CD simply sounds awful. The worst in this category is the first cut, ""Lambs"", which sounds like it was recorded in the back of a carpet store. The sound is muddy and indistinct. Some of the cuts are better than others on this score, but even ""Hit Somebody"" just doesn't sound mixed right.There are a few good tunes here, though and I remain a big fan of Warren's music. He should hire a better sound guy next time around."
3,"Warren gets lazy, and it shows","On My Ride's Here, Zevon works with collaborators like Hunter S. Thompson and Carl Hiaasen, to very mixed results. After the focus of Life'll Kill You, this CD is a bit of a mess. From the confusing (""Sacrificial Lambs, ""You're a Whole Different Person When You're Scared- Thompson's contribution) to the redundant (""Basket Case"") this CD has some weak offerings. But overall the good stuff outweighs the weaker material. ""The Hockey Song,"" is a wacky, but in the end uplifting, tale of struggle and ""Laissez-Moi Tranquille (Leave me alone) is le bon temp. Not a bad offering, but disappointing when you consider the talent involved and Warren's recent creative resurgence."
5,Master of the Genre,"Warren Zevon is one of the rare 80's-era musicians who has evolved enough to not only stay afloat, but excel in the modern age. Folk lines run through the tracks on this album, along with a few surprise styles that draw from the days of Classic Zevon. His songwriting collaborations with several popular authors enhance the storytelling inherent in the tracks, and the guitar and keyboard riffs are characteristically spot-on. Highly recommended for any rock and roll fan who hasn't yet discovered the rampant talent of WZ, and a must-add to the collection of die hards."
5,He's Down But Not Out,"Simply put, we'll miss him. But before he's gone, check out this collection of wonderful tunes, especially ""Hit Somebody"", the absolute best sports song ever written. How could anyone but Zevon make ""Rocket Richard"" the centerpiece of an opus? The songs are powerful. His voice and instrumental work, right on. Some of his best stuff. I hear another, likely final album, with a cut including Springsteen, is in the works. I can't wait."
4,Sweet Ride: More literate rock from Warren Zevon,"Continuing his comeback after 2000's ""Life'll Kill Ya,"" California folk rock's reigning bad ass turns out another near perfect set with ""My Ride's Here.""""Hit Somebody (the Hockey Song)"" is typical of the classic Zevon output from his days of ""Werewolves of London"" and ""Excitable Boy."" At first listen it comes off like a throwaway novelty hit, but you later realize that its quirky lyrics about violence and honor and catchy hook has burrowed into your brain. Sure, David Letterman's vocal turn on the song is a little distracting, but, hey, Letterman has done more to keep Zevon in the spotlight (via his obvious passion for his music) than anyone since Jackson Browne, circa 1976.Other songs, including the rockin' ""Basket Case,"" and the wistful ""I'm Leavin'"" continue the classic Zevon tradition of catchy tunes combined with hardboiled lyrics.If you're a Zevon fan, pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."
5,Zevon Cures Cancer,"California is a nation, and Warren its poet laureate. Having heard nothing at all through the grapevine, I've been scourin' the LA papers for an explanation, a report that the gods are after Zevon, that they've got 'em on the run. [The gods should relax - just because he's outrageous don't make him bad.] What else can the man do, half a Scotsman sayin' no more booze, getting much, much better with each release? An' for what, a waning public demand as the craft grows more beautiful, complex, and well defined? Expand his horizons, expand yours, it goes like that. Irish, Scottish, East European, South Floridian, new poetics, only thing that reeks is the public taste as a measure of greatness. Somewhere in sunny southern California sits an unshaven, undersized man, cold sober, who by rights ought to playing the Garden with his band five nights straight, but is instead contemplating his Smith & Wesson and an indifferent sky."
3,"O.K. , But might be his weakest effort.","""My Ride's Here"" Did Not Chart (2002).Again, Warren does not chart, ""My Rides Here"", to me is his weakest album, but it has some good moments in, ""Sacrificial Lambs"", ""Lord Byron's Luggage"", ""Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)"", with David Letterman as the bozo fan. ""Genius"" and the title track are also great songs. A few months later, Warren found out he had incurable cancer. He bravely started work on one more album ""The Wind""."
3,Overall OK but again not much of a direction,"I found this CD to be very well produced and excellent in terms of production and sound quality. However, it is mostly layered collages and groove-oriented and lacks true originality. I think that most of all, it lacks a certain vision and depth."
4,It is great if you like this. Sucks if you don't.,"--- but you can never accuse Mickey Hart of being mediocre. This CD is extremely challenging. It is an unusual mix of new and old, and a type of rhythmic culture combining that I would like to see more of!!!!The world is getting smaller and smaller in many ways.Some of those ways are not necessarily good.Music is always good.----- Open your mind.------------- Open your heart.--- Meet it halfway.If you let go of your Should's and your GEE-IF-Only's, it is probable that you will love this CD like many of us do!!!!!ENJOY !"
1,Somebody forgot to write the music!,"Even the simplest Jazz tune starts with a ""head"" (melody) which the group plays before it blasts off into improvisation. The improvisation is strictly controlled by the melody and harmony of the original theme creating form, which is what makes good musical works make sense.You can't make a sensible musical entity by sitting down a bunch of diverse musicians and roll the tape...edit it later!Somebody forgot to write the MUSIC!"
2,If you're into panpipes,"If you're into panpipes buy this. I'm not and I find this to be a real waste of the Kodo drummer's talents. Many groups could have drummed on this disc, for the talent required of this music it really doesn't take Kodo drummers. What's more upseting is that they're responsible for writing all the music. It's just pop, and if you like pop then you can do worse, but if you're into world music, please try anything else in the Kodo repertoire."
5,Invaluable reference on Imperial Russia,"This book is VERY comprehensive and yet very easy to read. It gives historical background and event details without being boring. Its sections covering Imperial Russia (foreign policy, arts & literature, politics, etc) are amazing and not often found in modern books. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of Russia!"
4,Not a bad purchase,"At first, I thought, what a piece of crap... Why would I want a thing that holds my cash and won't let me at it for a month? Then I realized its usefulness and bought one. My birthday is in october, and I bought the thing in February. I wanted to buy an mp3 player ($300) in February, and I had the money, but thought the player would go down in price by the time of my birthday. Money has a way of slipping away without me noticing... I once spent $100 in 2 weeks without noticing. I set the clock to open in 5 months after I stuck $300 in there. Opened right on my birthday, and by then, the price of the mp3 player dropped to $250. Kept me from spending the cash early, either on another product or a higher priced mp3 player. The good thing is you can lock anything with it, not just money. The thing certainly wouldn't stand up to a hammer, so if you really needed your money early, you'd just have to give it a good smack..."
1,"good concept, needs work","my husband and I got this for our daughter...we are trying to learn about saving, the first one we returned because when put down the ""padlock"" would pop up,a defect we thought, but when the replacement came, it did the same thing...we based our purchase on the reviews that we read,but we were sadly mistaken,even a child not wanting to open the lock...can open it....its a good idea though!"
4,Great item,I set it to 3 days and it worked i also tryed 10 days and it worked (I have it used as a lock on somthing) it's the best
1,i don't like it,i was going to the mall one day so i set the time but my mom toke me the day before i didn't have anymoney because it didn't open my mom had to lend me the money i wouldn't buy this toy if i were you
4,"Wonderful, impossible to describe","This cd contains excellent songs such as verano, as well as classic gypsy kings tunes. If you like the gypsy kings be sure to get a copy of this cd."
2,"Very basic writting and science, does not inspire interest","The book is written in a very basic form, which does not invite or inspire the reader. It is repetitive at times, and the personal examples are frankly a little silly rather than ways of better understanding the science being discussed. It may be appropriate for high school kids, but then it may even be boring for them."
2,A VERY LONG COMPLICATED game,"This game is similar to risk. It has lots of rules and versions of play. My son is always eager to play it, but it takes literally days and days, so its one of those games you need a place to leave it set up. It has some history and strategy to teach about past technology and military strategy. Lots of small pieces. Its a cool game, but as a busy family we have never had the chance to finish it even when we have devoted a full weekend...maybe if we get snowed in this winter?!"
1,many problems with this game,"I was excited to play this game when I first bought it. However, after on eplay, I will probably never play the game again.I am a big fan of the pc game and assumed I would be able to play the board game with little difficulty. However, there were just so many issues. First, the instructions are pathetic. It lists game pices that don't even exist. For example. It told me I could build chariots, but there are no chariots included in the game. Second, trying to keep cities and improvements in order was confusing and usually got messed up during game play.If you are thinking of purchasing this game, don't bother. Play the pc game again instead."
4,A TASTE OF PURE ROCK,THIS IS WHAT IT USE TO BE BEFOR GARBAGE LIKE NIRVANA CAME OUT GREAT CD WITH 18 IN LIFE I WILL REMEMBER YOU AND PEAC OF ME ITS GREAT ROCK AND IT WILL LIVE ON
5,A fine debut album,"Skid Row came into the music scene towards the end of the 80's,shortly before the era of metal and hard rock ended. Skid Row was diffently one of the finest bands of that era. Where most the metal bands at the time were more pop than metal,the boys in Skid Row rocked pretty hard.With the combination of rockin' vocals from Sebastian Bach and the high quality of song writing Skid Row became a hit. The album may sound a bit dated know, but songs like Big Guns,Sweet Little Sister,18 and Life,Youth Gone Wild, and I Remember You still sound great coming out of the radio today.While their popularity only lasted a couple of years before Alternative came along Skid Row is a band not to be missed."
5,By Far The Best Skid Row CD Ever.,"This is one of the few ultimate head bangin' cds that i listenin' to on a day to day basis. Great Vocals, great guitars, just an all around great cd. a must have for any 80's rock fan."
1,Say what?,"If you can say flash-in-the-pan more than once without stuttering, this music is not for you."
1,The Underarm of Music,"Boy, they had to scrape the bottom of the barrel pretty hard to dig up this garbage. But it sold tons of copies to someone . . . and given the illiterate nature of the reviews on here giving this album 5 stars, I would wager very few copies of it sit on the shelves of Harvard or Chapel Hill dorm rooms. Dumb music for dumb ears . . ."
1,Bring back Matt Fallon!!!!!!!!!!,"Jon Bon Jovi cheated Matt Fallon out of his shot of making it big! He was the original lead singer of Skid Row before Jon Bon Jovi felt threatened by Matt's voice and convinced Skid Row to replace Matt with S. Bach! BUT it cam at a price,It cost Jon Bon JOvi 250,000 OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET to get Bach released from his contract with his ex manager! It's True look online and read all about it! And Now Bach is a fat loser and his doing nothing with his life!"
4,18 and Life!!!,Great song! Bought it for back ground music while I work. Will be back for more songs soon!!! Enjoy the great music of this generation.
3,Very good,"I do enjoy this CD, but it seems the first 5 songs on the CD are the better tracks. Sweet little sister, 18 and Life, Can't stand the Heartache seem to have a better sound than the remaining 5 songs of the CD, but good attempt."
4,Here it is,"If you are a late eighties rock fan, who loved the awesome, hard, grinding guitar riffs of the time, this album will not disappoint."
5,WOW,It doesnt get much better than this.This album still sounds as good now as it did then.One of the better metal bands of the 80s/early 90s.I cant say i like their later material to much.But this is a slice of heaven.
1,referigerator,I but that iden but it doesn't work I'm so sad about that.and I don't know how I can fix it.
1,Stay away from Igloo products!!,"I purchased an Igloo refrigerator and within a few weeks it completely stopped working. Curtis International (Igloo's parent company) has terrible customer service and will not honor customer warranties. After a year of trying to ge this resolved, I have found out that they have an unsatisfactory record with the Better Business Bureau and have many of these types of complaints. STAY AWAY FROM IGLOO PRODUCTS!!!"
3,loud little bugger,"Fridge does what it is supposed to do (keeps food cold) but has an annoyingly loud hum most of the time. If you care about having a quiet office or dorm room, I would look elsewhere."
1,Bad Fridge,"We ordered this refrigerator from Amazon; the first one came dented and wouldn't close; the second one the door hinge was broken (Amazon's return policy made sending these two back easy to do, thank you for that). The third fridge arrived and seemed fine until one month later food would freeze solid or spoil -- the temperature gauge obviously does not work. I do not recommend this refrigerator to anyone."
1,Not an Igloo - didn't last a year,"We bought two of these less than a year ago. One just crapped out, stopped cooling completely. Called Igloo about the warranty and they promptly indicated its not their product. Its made by some Chinese company that bought the use of the Igloo name. So we had to call a third party, pay half the price of the fridge to ship it back to them, and they say they will fix it or replace it with a refurbed unit. Thought we were buying quality with Igloo, but we learned you can't trust even a well known brand name!"
4,Good fridge; smaller than i thought,"I've only had this fridge for a couple of days, but I realized that it gets cold in about an hour or two. The picture on amazon made it seem a little bit bigger than it actually is, but its still a decent size. Small freezer, about 2 inches tall and 4 inches wide, so I bet you can keep like 2 or 3 ice cream bars in there. Perfect cube shape! It pretty much fits anywhere."
1,Died within 2 months!! DON'T BUY!,"I ignored the bad reviews and bought this fridge because of the great price and Amazon's free shipping. Worked great for the first 2 months and then just stopped working. The problem is that after 1 month from the purchase date you are screwed. Amazon will take it back, but only if you pack it up and ship it back to them, at your expense, and still they will only give a partial refund (not clear how much that is). Obviously some people luck out with this fridge. Roll the dice if you want but my recommendation would be to RESIST the temptation to purchase this very inexpensive fridge and look elsewhere."
2,damaged door,"Ordered this item and the door was badly damaged. Returned it, ordered another, didn't arrive until after I had left for vacation. Returned 5 weeks later to find that on the new one the door was also damaged but not as badly so will keep it and stick a metal decal over it. The packaging on this item both times was very poor so the SS door gets sliced and diced. Be prepared to return a few. Amazon was very helpful returning the first one but unfortunately there was not another one in stock. The next one came later than I planned."
1,Terrible Fridge,"I bought this fridge on 9/9/2011...it is now 10/26/2011 and my still in the wrapper fridge has died on me. This is a sad day for both me and all my food that has become spoiled. Curse Igloo for a faulty piece of mechanics that could be claimed to be a lasting product. This fridge couldn't last even 6 months, What is up with that! Amazon, please take this off the market and save our wallets. I gave this a try and now I am without a fridge and stripped of cash because of poor customer service from Igloo... People, hear me out.. Stay away from this product its no good :("
1,Worthless,"Purchased on 4/8/2011, stopped working on 8/29/2011. That about sums up what Igloo model FR180 refrigerator is all about. A piece of junk. But that is half the problem. I contacted Curtis International who sold me this thru Amazon. They want me to pay for shipping and a fee for return shipping. The warranty card states this (warranty is for 1 year parts and labor). Please take my experience and never do business with Curtis International. I have no recourse but to scrap this piece of junk and lose $79.00."
4,just love it,from the minute i plugged the item in it started to cool down. it keeps items nice and cold. i just love it
5,"Great Fridge for Office, under desk application!","Got this fridge for my wife's office at work. She loves it. There are some reviews that say it is loud. It seems not to be too loud to us. We have it stashed in the kick space under a desk. Mostly, if you get this type of fridge, you are trying to keep a few drinks and some snack food cold, not trying to live out of it. For that application, it works great!"
1,Weird and Strong Chemical Odor Coming From Fridge,"I just received this fridge last Wednesday for my office and since I plugged it in the moment I received it, it has been emitting a weird and very strong chemical odor. I cleaned the inside and outside of the fridge but it still has the odor. I called the manufacturer the same day and they told me to leave the fridge unplugged for 6 hours. I left it unplugged from Wed-Sun over the Thanksgiving holiday. Today, on Monday, I plugged it in again and it is still emitting the weird and very pugnant chemical smell. Did anyone else experience this problem? If it continues, I will return the product."
2,Short length of service,"I have always considered Igloo as a superior manufacturer, until now. I purchased this unit approximately 2 1/2 years ago and it has remained in my workshop until today. It has stopped functioning. The refrigerator certainly has not been abused as the door opens and closes perhaps 15 times per week. It would cost me more to repair than replace (plus I must consider the time lost). Igloo offers only a one year warranty, so it is a waste of time to contact them for assistance."
2,lasted less than a year....,"Well, it seemed to be running just fine but completely stopped working about a week ago. Now that I read all these reviews I see I made a poor choice!"
1,Hot Igloo FR180 REFRIGERATOR,Bought item November 30 and it does has quit working on March 8. Please save your money and buy a different brand.
5,Lamb Chop is still the best!!!,"I love Shari Lewis' Lamb Chop. My mother bought the Action Songs tape when my daughter (now 13Y/O) was under 1Y/O and not only did she love it but so did my son (now 12Y/O), my niece (now 3Y/O)...and she still does and now my 14 month old is just crazy about this video. It's a great 30 free minutes for me to get things done around the house."
1,wrong product,"I ordered Lambchop Play Along Action Songs, and I received Play-Along Songs. It was in the correct sleeve, but the tape is not what I ordered. The songs are not the ones that are on the Action Songs tape. AS I ordered two others, I was surprised that this was the wrong tape. I decided to just keep it, as it would have cost me more to send it back. I gave it to my grandchildren, and I have to say that they did not like it. I'm just going to donate it to a pre-school."
1,I Do Not Recommend This Item,"Although this walker is sturdy, lightweight, and inexpensive, the front wheels are not in alignment. That causes the walker to be very noisy when in use and, more importantly, hard to control--which makes it prone to collide with people and objects. Not good!"
3,Luke warm Response,"There are some books that keep you glued and till you don't read them, your life seems incomplete. This is NOT that kind of book. It gives a nice structured way to deal with Segmentation but it appears boring with long lengthy discussion; stuff that can end in a page is extended for 4-5 pages and thats what makes it so boring to read!!"
1,"you got the date wrong, amazon","this book wasn't published in 1955. budd hopkins didn't even get interested in ufos until 1964, and his first article on the subject appeared in 1976."
2,Repetitive,I have seen better film on teeth. Seemed like watching the same trick on the same street over and over. Some good crashes but not worth my money.
1,Hirt's Garden are crooks.,"BUYER BEWARE These people are crooks. If you order items from them they will ship partial orders, damaged orders and incomplete orders. They will not refund your money and you will be forced to fight the charges with your credit card company and through Amazon. It will take you months to get your money back if you can prove to your credit card company that the items were not shipped. After my first phone call to Hirt's Gardens to try and resolve the problem I never received any communications, they have not answered one of more than 8 emails and they no longer answer their phone. If they are not out of business they should be."
4,Decent Soft Pad,"Seems like a decent soft pad, although it wouldn't kill them to put some velcro strips on the bottom. The foam padding seems more suited to a hardwood floor than carpet. I have to rearrange the pad after every dance because while it doesn't move to any unsafe degree, it will slowly migrate across a carpet. Also, the center feels the same as the buttons, so in the more hectic dances you have no way of feeling where your feet are (with some of the more expensive pads, you can feel the buttons with your feet and know where you are).Still, I have no trouble with the responsiveness and didn't really see a soft pad that looked to be better. My suggestion: start with something like this (the game I got did not come with any pad, so I bought this one) and if you feel the DDR craze, pony up the cash for a hard, arcade quality pad and keep this one for when the guests come over."
1,"Horrible quality, unresponsive company.","I purchased this pad and the down arrow stopped registering within 3 days. I contacted the company and was promised a callback. No callback, no contact.The combination of a poor quality product and an unresponsive company means that I will never buy another product from this company again."
4,A good pad,"This pad will get the job done for DDR Ultramix. The buttons are sensitive enough for the game and it has a decent amount of padding. It's very similar to the soft Konami pad that came bundled with DDR Ultramix.However, there are a few cons to the pad. First, it's recognized as a regular controller on Xbox Live. Also, the ports at the top of the pad do not support the headset (which the Konami pad does). It will only take memory cards. So if you want to play online, you are better off with the Konami pad that came with the game (which you cannot buy more of).However, these are great for extra pads when you have friends over. Personally, I bought two of them so I could then ""mod"" them by giving them a hard cover. I did this with plexiglass squares and a hardboard. Directions to do this can be found with a search for ""DDR Chubby Pad"" on the internet.I came out with two really nice pads that will last a long time."
1,Horrible!! Big Waste of Money,"I am a big DDR fan, and was very dissapointed with this mat. On the third day of recieving, my down arrow was broken, and Naki's telephone and website are out of service. My friend owns a Konami mat, and they are very good, but I have to save up for one, which is a pain. That might sound sad, but I am only 14 and they cost 50 bucks!"
1,not money well spent,"This pad works great for a couple hours, and, just like everyone else, the down arrow stops registering. Don't waste your money on this pad. I am so mad that I didn't read the reviews before buying this product. Also, you can't feel with your feet whether you're stepping on an arrow or another button. And, where are the lights? Oh, and Naki's phone number and website are out of service. I'm not buying a Naki product again."
2,Good for a day,"This pad works very very well, for one day... After the first night the back button went out. I read a few other comments and apparently its not just me haveing this problem. Dont blow your money on this pad. There are plenty out there that work better. I just got a $19 cheepO pad that works better this this PoS"
5,Couldn't be better,"Outside of the pads at the arcade or putting down over $100 for a solid pad, this is the best out there. The pads are very responsive and have a nonskid surface on the bottom so they don't slip around. Great buy!"
1,Horrible quality. DO NOT BUY!,"This looked like a good buy from walmart. Got it, and all the moves dont' register. I contacted Naki and they never got back. Called them, never got an answer. Walmart refuses to take it back. This was the biggest mistake I made with buying this mat!"
2,No good for xbox live!,"This is a pretty good pad UNLESS you are using it on xbox live. It will not show up on xbox live as a dance pad, so people think you are using a standard controller and don't want to play against you.Naki has been totally unresponsive in answering my questions about this.We have two of them and they both exhibit the problem."
1,"Yea, I got burned, too.","I picked up this pad and, just like everyone else, the back arrow stopped working after a while. By all means, avoid this one."
1,Same as everyone--piece of ****,"I bought two of these, and the down arrow stopped working on BOTH within two days. I noticed this long before I read all the reviews that told of the same problem, but when I saw the reviews I realized that it was the product itself. Amazon took it back (I think, because it's been 5 days and I haven't gotten a refund yet), but my friend has the wireless pad and says it's terrible. I don't want to spend a crazy amount of money, and I want to buy new pads from a reliable dealer. What should I get that works for Xbox? And do the simple Intel Dance Pads work for Xbox? If someone could write a response review, that'd be great."
1,Do not buy this pad!!!!,"Down arrow key stopped sensing after 1/2 hour of use. Ordered replacement of same through Amazon. (Return process on Amazon was a snap and we had a replacement pad in 2 days. Thanks Amazon!) Second pad worked for 1/2 hour and then down arrow stopped sensing. This time I cracked open the circuit board and was able to verify that the board electronics were working but the pad refused to sense. Clearly Naki has some manufacturing bugs to work out. Went over to Best Buy and picked up two MadKatz controllers last night and they seem great. Can't speak for other pads, but this one is a 0 star."
1,Both of mine are broken.,"I've bought 2 of these and both of them are broken. Like several other reviewers, my rear buttons lose connection. Mine work for about 3-5 minutes of play."
1,Inferior product,"I bought two of these pads, and they both failed after just a day of use. Some of the buttons just stopped working. I had to return both. My daughters love the game. It's one video game that gets them to exercise, so I'll probably fork out more money for some better pads."
4,Diadora Soccer Outfield Gloves,"It was quite difficult to find suitable soccer player outfielder gloves combining lightness with warmth, comfort and good sizing, and a considerable amount of time was originally spent finding possible gloves on internet.We bought 2 pairs last year and my son was delighted with the quality and washability, so we just bought 2 more pairs. A good product.Diadora Player's Glove."
2,Off the Beaten Track [IMPORT],Heard of Talbot and White from various Acid Jazz CDs. This was a live album which I am not partial to. I got none of the bop and groove I expecting. A lot of solo drumming. This one did not have samples to save me the grief.
5,Superb Glasses!,"I bought these in a 6 pack version. I have also the Pinot Noir fluted glasses in Esperenze style. A former reviewer mentioned the instant aromatic influence the ripples provide at the base of the glass. I completely agree. My husband and I have wine parties, and decanting all of the wines can be a hassle. This almost eliminates the reason to do so. Incredible value for the quality of stemware that you get. Thin, yet sturdy; I just adore these glasses."
5,"Um, Zoe.....","I used an expanded vocabulary because of my maturity. I am not the queen of My Scene or Bratz, I just like them both. But I try to get girls to END THE WAR! IT NEEDS TO STOP! It is rude how peoples' opinions are being argued. I think everyone should get used to My Scene, Bratz, Barbie, and Polly, because more & more are coming out. They are staying on Earth. If you don't like one or the other, PLEASE quit going to the other ones' page. I CAN contact Amazon.Yes, I AM threatening Bratz fans who come here, and My Scene fans that go there.Chelsea Churro(My Scene & Bratz Fan;Peacekeeper)OVER, & OUT!!!!!PS-Zoe, do I really sound like 'Peace, Man, What-up D-U-D-E'?LOL!"
1,(leweez10 speaking) She doesn't have to listen to you,"If she wants to write mean things about My Scene dolls, then she can. Your not her mama. She hates My Scene dolls, I do too and so what. We can and we can do what we want here like it or not.P.S. My Scene dolls are ugly and satan, Bratz are pretty and angels."
5,I HAVE THIS DOLL!!!,AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER! KEEP UP THE GREAT JOB MATTEL! GET THIS DOLL! I LOVE HER!GO BARBIE!!!
4,SYNTH-POP POWER>>>,"For all fans of synth-pop, I think you'll enjoy this. If you ever clubbed on retro night, I'm sure you've heard ""Arts in D Minor/Harry Houdini"" somewhere along the line. Other favorites are: ""I Beg Your Pardon""- Cool remake! ""PussNBoots""- Totally rockin' tune complete with samples from Zeppelin and Nancy Sinatra, and a radical hip-hop break. Oh yeah! ""Move to Move""- Nice beat, lyrics you can relate to. Some of the songs are so-so, but I recommend it anyway."
4,Different and interesting,"I bought about 10 CD's and this was one that I liked. It has nice synth pop music, the lyrics are less appealing than the background music. None of the songs are great, yet none are bad. It provides a nice continuity to drive to. I'd say it was good driving music."
1,good but,Excellent evil the unique thing music of this cd is that came me or has a failure in the track 11 in the minute 5:15 otherwise an excellent cd
3,"One good song, the rest -- eh!","Kon Kan is best known for their one-hit single ""I Never Promised You."" This is a mediocre album otherwise, with all the 1980s cliches -- orchestra strikes, sampling, synth drums, unemotional vocals. I don't regret buying this -- but you can't get around the fact that it's very dated."
4,Kon Kan,"I have a dirty secret. I'm a major fan of 80's techno-pop but never listened to Kon Kan until recently. The Move to move is fantastic, what more can i say, I wish the bands of today could have learned something from their 80's predesesors. Buy Kon Kan Move to Move, the lyrics are unique and the sound of the key board put them is incredible. If you like this band chech out Alpha Ville, similar in ways.."
5,One of the best 80s CD,"I have known Kon Kan's work in the Philippines. Kon Kan never made it big to the U.S. but it was in Asia. If you get a chance to listen to this CD, I guarantee that if you're a synthesizer, 80s loving freak like me..you will totally love it!"
5,One of the Greats,"Read anything by Kippling. He was the first to make poetry interesting for me in my early teens. The stories exposed me to a history and culture that was largely inaccessible otherwise, illustrating how to put oneself in another's shoes. There are moral lessons and insights throughout his entertaining work, from humor to drama.I can still quote elements of his poetry after 40 years, such as his rejection of racism, nationalism, and class:""There is neither breed, nor border, nor birth,When two strong men stand face to face,Though they come from the ends of the earth.""Thinking on this in the context of the poem, one understands that ""strong"" refers to integrity and courage, and that age and gender are irrelevant to these as well."
5,Real PT Shirt,These are the real Army PT shirts with reflective paint and the A on the back I've been looking to replace my PT shirts that are just absolutely destroyed (some I've had since basic in 2002) most of the shirts I've found aren't the real thing but these are great. Buy these shirts
1,Spikey Mikey Plays to an Audience of 3.,"You can tell the excitement of the three people by the bored guy who yells because he's had too many, the drunk who throws bottlecaps at the band because they truly suck without Jay (yes, Mikey fooled Jay's fans again), and the drunk who keeps burping because his acid reflux has more range than Miss Clairol's number one fan. The bar is so empty that the reverb is laughable. It sounds like they recorded this in a haunted house. Hmm, how very appropo..."
4,"Nice flavor, excellent for recipes","Recently purchased several cans of this for inclusion in dessert recipes that called for coffee flavoring, and they turned out very well. Also, one of the folks in our office makes supremely weak coffee, and a spoon of this brings it up to drinking strength quite nicely! Definitely a great way to add coffee flavor to something; far better than regular instant coffees.I've tried several varieties of instant espresso, and none (including this) really make anything like real espresso; I have all the apparatus to make it at home, and this doesn't compare. However, unlike the other instants, this IS reasonably tasty when made to espresso-strength, and I find myself actually drinking it as an ""espresso-like"" beverage once in a while."
5,Really good instant espresso!,"I buy this because the flavor stands up to the addition of milk but isn't bitter when I make lattes. It has an authentic coffee flavor...not like Starbucks but pretty good for what it is. I am the only one in my household who drinks lattes and this is a good option for me. Like any ground or instant coffee, the taste will degrade the longer it is open and unused. But I like it and have bought it repeatedly."
2,Less than steller,"This is actually an older software system offered by the company Transparent Language. It comes with 3 audio CDs: A+ Spanish (15 Spanish lessons), Spanish Before You Know It! digital vocabulary cards, and a 60 minute Living Language Audio CD. First of all, this will not make you fluent in Spanish. I didn't really like the layout of the A+ Spanish program and did not find it very user-friendly. The digital speech analysis is useful, but it doesn't come with a headset (You'll have to purchase one). The games were repetitive and not ""fun"" in my opinion. I guess you get what you pay for in language software."
1,"WOW, what a rip-off!","Seems like a good deal at first - but after paying for the test, $20 for priority shipping, and the $10 ""Expidite"" fee, SIX days later (and a missed real estate transaction deadline!) and they STILL don't recognize our test kit number when we call, even though I have delivery confirmation and a signature from someone who received it. NO RESULTS, NO EXPLANATION.The ""Kidde"" website has no mention of radon test kits anywhere. If you do manage to find the website where you can input the kit number, it's under an entirely different company name, ""Dr. Home Air,"" which is different again from the company name in the mailing address! It's entirely shady.If I could have given them zero stars, I would have. Learn from my fail, and hire yourself a professional from the beginning."
1,The hype is great! Not much else!!,"The price you pay for this radon test apparently includes the test fee. But you are still required to pay postage. Apparently the post office has enough trouble delivering the envelope that the company has an announcement about you maybe wanting to use FedEx or UPS instead of the U.S. mail. When I mailed my package, sure enough, it came back 10 days later for postage, which maybe fell off during processing? I put more stamps on and remailed it. A few weeks later, I got a letter from the company saying the radon test was too old to process. But here's the kicker - no refund for the price I paid! They collect the entire fee up front - $16 or so, and then never have to do the test or report results. So that made me feel scammed. How many of us really has $16 to waste?My two cents worth. Here's what I know: My $16 is gone, and I know nothing about radon in my house.Christine"
1,Consumer Reports - lowest reliability and lowest accuracy,"Looks like all the negative reviews have this kit pegged; Consumer Reports, which I pulled up to read, after reading most all of these, agrees. Lowest accuracy and lowest reliability. Thanks for the warnings about the customer service, too. I'm returning mine, purchased but unused, to Lowe's straightaway. Saved the frustration!"
1,Don't Bother,"We purchased this radon kit and used it exactly per instructions. My results were emailed to me in were extremely high (20pCi/l). We ended up paying for the hourly reading (Radalink Radon Monitors)from a home inspection company licensed with the equipment. The results were much different - luckily low levels of radon(1.2 pCi/l). I'd say save your $20, heartache over possibly having to purchase the radon fans, and call a home inspector for a more accurate reading the first time."
5,Obsessed,"I'll admit that I'm a sucker for Nars. The product line is fantastic. This lip lacquer is to die for. I like his lip gloss but this is even better. It lasts for several hours before needing to be re-applied. Also, it is less sticky and will provide you with more color than the lip gloss will. It's a little annoying having to always have a lip brush on hand, but it's worth it."
3,Good for a short while,"My daughter got this for her first Christmas last year when she was 5 mos old and she was able to play with it for a little bit before she got sick of it. It's very cute and yes it is flimsy but in my opinion it's meant for little babies that can't roll over yet. I did take the toys off the tail for a little bit but even those got boring to my daughter which is unusual. I'm saving it for whenever we decide to have a second child but it's really only good for the little days. There are no toys on mine that make music either. I have a squeaky one, a mirror, and one that doesn't do anything."
2,not practical,"The nice part about this toy is that it doesn't take much movement to activate the music, however the toy bar isn't very stable and seemed to hit my child in the face a lot. We ended up taking the toys off the toy bar and letting my son play with them seperately. He has no interest in the stuffed tigger at all."
2,"cute, but don't waste your money","This is a really cute toy with even cuter toys, but the turtle sings every time I walk past it so I had to take the batteries out of it and the tail...it's too close to my daughter's face and it won't stay up half the time. It's a great idea, but not worth the money"
1,Not the best Disney product...sorry Tigger!,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. With any luck, I'll be able to return it for something safer and more enjoyable. The tail does not stay up and that defeats the whole purpose of a play gym. If I had put my son under Tigger's arched tail, the toys would have smacked him right in the head as the tail repeatedly falls down!I have read other reviews about people complaining about the turtle playing loudly at the slightest movement. Mine must be broken because it doesn't play at all!(unless Disney changed the turtle after all the complaints? I don't know).I see that there is a website giving this item away as a free gift. That's about what I'd value it at."
2,Not very impressed,"I am not very impressed by this Disney toy. My daughter is 3 1/2 months and gets very agitated because Tigger's tail will not stay up where she can play. As soon as she hits at the toys hanging down the tail falls where she cannot see them or play. This causes aggravation for me because I have to constantly fix the tail so she can play again. Also, the turtle plays music very loudly and at the drop of a hat and I have not been able to find an off button for it. However, the Tigger is very cute and very huggable so maybe it will be better when she is older."
4,It all depends on your baby,"We received this toy as a gift for our new son. Like many play mats it has an area to lay your child with toys overhead. Very cute, unfortunately our son liked to grab a hold of the turtle and pull it down, hitting himself in the face. This of course made him very angry, heck all he was trying to do was eat the silly turtle. On the other hand a friend of ours, daughter loves it; she'll just lie on the floor babbling away to the rings. So it all depends on your baby. Over all, I rate this toy as a ""might as well give it a try"". For all we know when our son gets older he may love it as a giant drag along stuffy."
1,Flimsy and flat,"I bought this toy for my infant son as well as my infant nephew. The pictures made it look like something I could eventually prop the baby on and later on, he could have a big stuffed animal to play with. When I took the item out of the package, it was flat and flimsy. I thought there must be somewhere that you could at least stick a pillow in it to make it look like the Tigger that was advertised. There wasn't a place to stick a pillow. Because it was so flat, the tail was hard to keep upright. I wish I'd spent the money on something else."
1,Nothing Like It Looks Like,"This is nothing like we thought it would be. It is WAY smaller than they make it look somehow for one. Two, the toys hang WAY to low. Right smack in baby's face because the doll is really flimsy and the tail just sags down. I think I wouldnt be quite so upset if it wasnt 35.00!! I'd pay like 10.00 knowing how it is now. I think I may try to return."
2,cuter than it is practical,"We received this item as a gift for our son. I have to agree with 2 other reviews: Tigger's tail doesn't stay up as it should, (falls backward, as though the toys make it too heavy). Also,I find my child to be annoyed by how 'confining' the toy seems to be while lying underneath, without much room to move at either side. The musical turtle is a bit loud, and goes off at the slightest movement.While there's no doubt it's cute, it doesn't seem to perform so well."
2,"Adorable, but that's it.","It's definitely cute, but the bar holds the toys too close to baby's face. This scares my daughter, who likes other baby gyms. The music is also loud and intimidating to her. We've now just taken the two non-musical toys off and placed them on another gym toy for her to play with, and the Tigger and musical turtle sit up in her room."
1,"unorganized, badly planed, worse than the manual!","I have been thru the other books from peachpit press and this one pretty much fall into the worst ones published by this company. If you have no idea on how DVD works, this book will lead you to more confusion and scare you away from DVD authoring! The manual come with the application is undoubtly the least informative from Adobe and this book certainly doesn't help at all. The Advanced Motion Menu section, for instance, does not mention other ways of creating the buttons or how to use the library, and does not explain on how to create motion buttons in Photoshop. This book touchs alot of topics, but it does not present the whole procedure nor give you details on how the inner works of DVD authoring. Don't buy this book if you really want to learn Encore DVD, and get the Adobe Classroom in a book instead!"
5,This entire book is a party!,"I ran across this terrific little book and it saved my party life.It's hard to continue to come up with great party ideas when youhave as big a family as I have. Don't want to be out done. When Ireceived Patty Sachs' party book -- I became the 'Queen of Parties'.Everyone wonders why my parties went from dull to DELIGHTFUL!Read it! She's a wonderful writer, too. Fun to read."
3,All the same,I am in my late 40's and I thought the children games wpuld have changed by now this book was the same games i played as a child so I wasted my money on this little book . Seller delivered book on time very quick wish the description of the games was posted.
4,Excellent insight,"As a new reader of the Bible, I find that although I have not read the book in its entirity, ""Mark: A Devotional Commentary..."", it is an excellent source of information on the Gospel according to St. Mark. I especially enjoy reading it during Eucharistic Adoration."
4,Mark,Mark is the gospel that shows the human side of Jesus and leads us all to the divine. A must read for someone who wants understanding.
4,Quick Read,The text reads easily and is uplifting. I would definitely recommend it to others with a need to learn more about themselves and the course in life that we follow.
4,A Thoughtful book,"This book so far is one of the most informative and inspirational comentarys I have ever read. I am very pleased as to the way the book is layed out,with the verse first and the comentary / meditation next. I will continue to review verses after I have completed the book."
5,Energize with Fabulous Forever,"This video will help you feel energized and healthier in both body and mind. The routine and easy to follow instructions make it effortless, even if you're not used to exercising.Mirabai Holland conveys important information throughout the video. Her obvious joy and pleasure with exercise are contagious!The Fitness Fairy offers inspiration and benefits with no intimidation or ridiculous enthusiasm."
5,Terrific video,"This is a wonderful video for the over-40 market as well as for anyone who is just entering the world of aerobics. No equipment is required, and the music is great! Mirabai Holland's routine is eminently do-able, even for the inexperienced. It's easy to follow and well-cued, and she is enthusiastic throughout. Perhaps this should be called ""non-threatening aerobics."" Ms. Holland also explains the value of aerobics and provides valuable information on heart rate and the importance of warm-up and cool-down. I also really liked the fact that it was one-on-one - no intimidating models to distract me or make me feel uncoordinated. Just a private session between me and Mirabai Holland."
2,"I wanted to love this book, but it irritated me instead","I really wanted to love this book -- the story sounds so engaging and uplifting, with an inner-city child from the Fresh Air Fund opening up the life of a reclusive young woman. However, I ended up irritated by it instead: the twists and turns of the plot are so far-fetched, particularly the sudden and radical effect the child has on the life of the main character. The way in which the child suddenly appears and instantly rescues someone who's been deeply mired in agoraphobia for years just doesn't seem convincing -- the author is using a ""deus ex machina"" scenario to solve some very complex problems. The book tries hard to tug at the reader's heartstrings, but for me, the story just never rang true."
3,"Implausible, yes. Immensely engaging fairytale, YES!","This story is completely transparent, sometimes contived in its name-dropping-for-authenticity-sake style, but it is nevertheless an enjoyable read that focuses on interior issues rather than suspenseful plot-driven drama. Too much surface, not enough substance with regard to agoraphobia and its limitations, as well as the tired romanticized plotline could cause realists to disregard its character-clarity. However, the omnivorous reader will find much to like in the self-ruminations of these individuals, implausibility, aside. I was looking for a light-hearted story without the ""Nora Roberts"" formula. The sequel, however, simply screams ROMANCE NOVEL. As much as I liked being in this flawed character's head, the author lost me at the end while she was setting up the sequel."
4,Readable,"This is a hard book to review. On one hand, it is a very readable story- it is easy to while away a snowy afternoon turning the pages and absorbing yourself in this book. However, there are SO many faults with the plot. THe story is way too contrived- woman almost never leaves the house, does not speak to anyone over the phone except to place work orders, sees a little girl in her backyard, and within 8 days she is transformed. She's called old friends, made new ones, got a new job... And all because of a too precocious 9 year old girl! It has to be fiction. Never has there been such a neat, happy, ending, where all things are as they should be. Near the end of th book, Lucinda is remarking that she can't beleive it's only been a month...well, neither can we. It's totally impossible to beleive that this could happen to anyone.But plausibility aside, the book has its moments. The language is simple, and for anyone who does not wish to see a bad ending, this is perfect."
5,Good grooves,"I'm pretty picky, but this album is good. If you like those smooth African translations of U.S. funk, soul- you'll enjoy this."
5,great book,"I loved reading this book, it gave new and insightful details of the battle of Midway without being revisionist."
1,Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway (e-book),"First let me say that the content of the book was excellent. I would be the first to recommend it in hardcover but the e-book version is horrable. It must have been scanned by the publisher and offered for sale without anyone checking the scan for errors. Words are constantly run together others are split and some are over written. The publisher has a lot of nerve charging $15.00 for a book that he didn't take the time to proof read. If you decide to buy the e-book version, download the sample first and be assured that the rest of the the book is even worse than the sample."
5,Review of Shattered Sword,"This is a clearly written and articulate book that is a generally easy read. It tells the story from the Japanese side only, presenting their capabilities and failures, detailed and apparently without bias. If you have watched the films ""Tora, Tora,Tora, or read the book,""Climb Mt Nitake"", forget the soft renditions of Japanese leadership, capabilities and strategies! This picture seems realistic and unbiased. In general, a fascinating read."
5,The Minutia Of Battle,"At over 600 pages with 30% of the book full of footnotes, tables and other information, if you are a minutia geek this is the FINAL book on Midway. This book is told primarily on the side of the IJN. The American victory is more of Japanese incompetence at the highest level and luck on the side of the intelligence department of Joseph Rochefort's Pearl Harbors' Basement Bunch. The American Navy, although victorious, by virtue of the Japanese Navy withdrawing from the field of battle and loosing four first line carriers, had a horrible day by loosing 50% of their aircraft either by being shot out of the air or being lost due to mechanical failure. It is mostly luck and good sailoring by the American Navy is what gave them the victory. We are fortunate that this author had done so much investigation on the other side of the equation, the IJN. This IS the definitive book on Midway."
4,Shattered Sword,"Brilliantly researched but detail is at times overwhelming. It must surely be the definitive history of a truly massive and pivotal battle lost by the Japanese through a fatal lack of cooperation between army, navy and airforce and poor naval intelligence. But a book one can't put down even tho I found myself skipping slabs of type.James Clarke"
5,Shattered Sword,"The outstanding feature of this book is putting under a microscope the thinking that went into the planning of the ""Battle of Midway"" from the Japanese perspective. We see information that changes our picture of 'things we thought we knew.'One of the more interesting features of the book is a study of how aircraft carriers operated, and the differences between the American carriers and the Japanese vessels.There is also a clear picture of the structure of the Japanese aircraft command, and of the way in which the American pilots flew.My favorite of all......."
5,Excellent work!,"This book provides an account of the Midway battle from the Japanese perspective, and sheds light on previous works and accounts which have long been considered accurate. I was looking for one, complete, definitive book for this battle, and this is definitely the right one. The amount of new information presented (as of 2005) on an event that took place over 60 years ago is incredible. Kudos to Parshall and Tully for their research and presentation. This book is one of the best I have read in years. I highly recommend ii!"
5,Book Review,"Great book very well done and very detailed. I have read a lot of WW II history most of course based on American sources and only a few Japanese interviews right after the war. Samuel Elliot Morrison's navel history to name one. This book looks at Japanese records and paints a really different picture than the classic view from the book, ""Incredible Victory"" I highly reccomend this book to students of WW II in the Pacific. You will rethink a lot you thought you knew."
5,Shatterd Sword - Shatterd Myths,"A step by step time line and analysis of the June 1942 Midway Naval battle that doomed the Imperial Japanese military global ambitions.The narrative clearly dispels the myths previously presented by other written treatments and popular movies.Presented in easily understood language the reader will come away with an appreciation for Aircraft Carrier tactics and the efforts and sacrifices made by members of the US Navy, Marines, and Army in achieving this victory."
4,Details of Battle of Midway,Excellent and extremely detailed account of the people and forces in the battle of Midway. The authors describe how the Japanese culture affected the battle and this is quite interesting. The authors at times spend more description than is neede to discuss possible alternative strategies the Japanese could have used in the battle.
4,Shattered Sword,Interesting book. One doesn't realize how many myths exist that are considered. Dispite the mistakes Midway was a significant victory for the U S Navy and a tradegy for Japan.
5,Ultimate account,An excelent and ultimate account to the Battle of Midway. This book deserves attention of everyone who is interested in the Pacific-war-topic.Parshall & Tully describes this famous battle from the japanese side: not necessary japanese point of view but from the decks (and under-decks) of japanese warships. They shows not only behaviour and acts of (commanding) officers and man of Kido Butai and Yamamoto's staff but also the tactics and doctrine of IJN and above all IJN's aircraft carrier operations.
3,Needs editing,"Offers new and worthwhile insights on this famous battle, but suffers greatly from an annoyingly amateurist writing style. There is literally a cliche or hackneyed phrase on every page (one of my 'favorites' being ""Into this lion's den of stacked deck politics walked Commander Sasaki Akira...""). A competent editor would have improved this book enormously. That said, I must add that I found much of the information in Shattered Sword very thought provoking."
3,Good information... at times.. and terribly annoying...,"I wish to amplify some of the earlier review comments:1) The use of Japanese instead of English is annoying. What's next? Are we going to have kanji in the next edition?2) The writing is childish at times. It often seems like the authors are participating in an internet forum flame war and not writing a serious piece of history.3) I'm not sure who I believe... Prange and Lord or these guys. Even if Prange or Lord were wrong in many places, I doubt they would have chosen to reinforce their positions on a given item with the equivalent of ""neener-neener, we're right and they're wrong"" over and over again.In the future, I'd like the facts, and just the facts. I'll check your sources, compare your opinions with other authors, and make my own decisions."
2,fantastic story but the maps are too small.,The story is great but in the kindle version the map printing is so small you can't really read them.
2,Pretentious,"Overly pompous account, by authors that seem to have some kind of agenda.They used seemingly official Japanese WWII documents..... that have been hiding where for the past 50 odd years? How did so many researchers for so many years, miss all this documentation that the authors of this book suddenly had access to?What was seriously missing, were first hand accounts, the human factor in the story."
5,Great book,"More than just history, this book is a great read. The writing style flows nicely and makes it easy to understand and engages the reader. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the Battle of Midway, or just history in general. You don't have to be a historian to enjoy this book."
5,Shattered Sword - Midway from Japanese Side,This is an excellent history of the Battle of Midway from the Japanese perspective. It presents details that help explain how the Japanese came to lose a battle that based on the numbers they should have won in spite of the intelligence advantage the US had. There is no one gotcha like the coding breaking by the Americans but large number of small errors in tactics and thinking that lead to the Japanese fleet being in position to lose.
1,Caution if you sleep on a soft or medium support pillow,"I bought the snoogle when I was five mos. pregnant. The head support is extremely padded and compares to a firm support pillow. After using it one night I was in discomfort from neck pain. I took it back. If you usually use a soft or medium support pillow, like I do, this may not be the best choice of a maternity pillow for you."
4,This pillow is great!,"My husband found the Snoogle online and suggested I get it after he noticed that I was tossing & turning in my sleep often. I too found it in the Baby Depot. Everywhere else was sold out! It is really comfortable and keeps me in position so I don't feel like I am pressing on my belly. My non-pregnant sister tried it out and tried to steal it. The only thing I wish it had was a cover. I don't know how to wash it, but I have not looked at the care instructions yet."
5,Love this pillow!,"I've had this thing for about a week now, and I just LOVE it! yes it gets hot because it's summer, and I'm pregnant so anything touching me in bed makes me hot. This is not the pillow's fault! I'm so comfortable now, and I'm not tossing and turning like I was beginning to do. Our dog likes to curl up on the other side of the pillow and we both snooze away the Sunday morning. Highly recommend."
3,Good size but needs to have a cover,"everything about this pillow is great, there is only one big problem! how am I going to wash it? it needs to be sold with a cover that you can take out and wash from time to time for obvious reasons... one being you always want your pillow to smell good and be clean when you jump in bed...Other than that... good product..."
4,Snuggle worthy,The pillow gives good support and comfort. It helps keep my body aligned for a better sleep.
1,Poor Quality-Get if you hate your partner!,"After reading the raves on this and other websites, I was eager to try this pillow. I've had horrible times sleeping during pregnancy and was hopeful this would help. And it did, for about a month until the cheap materials showed it up. The portion of the pillow between my knees compressed into nothingness and was totally unsupportive thereafter. It's tricky to roll over with (I always had to wake up to do it) and the fabric is really rough and scratchy. It also did not offer enough support for my neck. Get this pillow if you never want to cuddle your partner again, it's so cumbersome, you won't be able to--it's like the Great Wall."
4,AWESOME!,"The pillow is a must have for preggy ladies, but the guys will love it also. DH won't give it back, so he got one of his own. He has back problems and its been great for him and I have never slept better since I've used it!The only thing I hate is the cover, its impossible to deal with. Also its bluky, but what do you expect? Once you get it in the bed with you and get the covers situated its awesome.I knock it down a star for the cover, there's got to be a better way to put a case on that!"
4,Must buy,"As I was getting near 2nd trimester, I was trying to master sleeping on my left side. I read this in one of the pregnancy books that you should train your body sleep on the left side to help circulate the blood flow better to the baby. Since I'm a back sleeper, it was incredibly hard to sleep on one side throughout the night. I started having neck and back pain. My friend suggested I use the snoggle. I have to said, it really helped. I had to place a small pillow under my head to elevate my upper body but overall I would definiately recommend this product to all expecting mothers out there."
3,"Very useful pillow, should have bought organic one","I was having lower back pain during pregnancy around 20 weeks and bought this. It's been 3 weeks and my pain has been totally gone since a few days after owning Snoogle. I don't know if the snoogle is to thank or just coincidence. I still wake up on my back sometimes and kinda fumble with what to do with my arms, but I am not normally a side-sleeper. I'm a small person so my little dog and I can share the snoogle with him behind my legs, which is absolutely adorable.The big con is the cover: 65% polyester/45% cotton. I've used 100% cotton sheets my whole adult life and forgot how scratch polyester is. I wish I'd bought the organic Snoogle that comes with a cotton cover, it would have been worth the price difference to me. I just put a couple t-shirts on it, but it looks pretty sloppy that way. I'm probably not going to spend the money for the replacement cover, even though cotton ones are available, since they're so expensive."
5,Best pillow ever!,Hands down the most comfortable and supportive body pillow. Great for pregnancy and any time! There are a ton of ways to use it.
5,Awesome pillow!,"I got this pillow when I was 3 months pregnant because I was trying to prevent myself from sleeping on my back. Not only did the pillow help me avoid rolling onto my back, it also provides great support and comfort. Now 6 months pregnant I still sleep amazingly well at night. The pillow is great in all positions described/shown. I have not noticed it to flatten out either, its holding up really well."
2,Works at first...,"I adored this pillow when I first purchased it. I have had several abdominal surgeries, and it helped keep me positioned so I wasn't rolling onto my stomach, and was very comfortable. After about a month, the padding on the inside of the pillow has completely compressed and separated into chunks, making this pillow virtually useless. It's way too expensive for the short life it had."
5,Best pillow ever!,I got this pillow for my pregnant daughter and she absolutely loves it! She went on a trip and seriously tried to figure out if it would fit in her suitcase. When she returned her first thought was 'I can't wait to sleep with my Snoogle!'
3,Not for restless sleepers,"I like this pillow for the sole purpose that it is firm and fits between my knees and feet simultaneously. The cons for me are that when it's under a blanket it's next to impossible to turn over, turn the pillow over with the two curls (on each end) without disrupting all the sheets and blankets and hubby in bed. I am a restless sleeper and I switch side to side all night and this was just a pain. I also have a problem with the curl at my head being too firm, I wake up and my ear is throbbing and numb. It's too big and bulky there to have my own pillow under my head. Overall the pillow is great quality."
4,Life with Snoogle,"This wonderfully curved pillow was the first thing my sister recommended when I got pregnant; the girl knew what she was talking about. Snoogle hasn't left the bed in five months, much to the displeasure of my husband, who's had to reckon with less bed space and a somewhat cumbersome barrier between him and me.That said, it feels good to be able to sleep again. The pillow worked well in my first trimester, when I could still sleep on my back; it elevated my legs to relieve lower back pain. In the second trimester, it's a helpful wedge that cushions my abdomen and keeps my hips aligned. Bulky as it is, I don't travel without it; it gets its own suitcase!My gripe that knocks this down to a four-star rating is the pillowcase. Snoogle is expensive and comes with only one pillowcase that is horrendously difficult to take off and even worse to put back on."
2,Not as comfortable as I was hoping for....,"When I was about 6 months pregnant, I decided to invest in a snoogle because I was getting no sleep at night. The first night I had it, I thought it was heaven. But then I started getting headaches every morning and realized it was because of the snoogle. It wraps around you so that the top part is actually used as a pillow. I am used to thick, soft, down-filled pillows, and the snoogle is very hard and uncomfortable. I guess if you like hard, cotton pillows, it won't matter, and in that case, this would be a great item. But I just can't sleep without a soft pillow for my head. I am now back to using a regular body pillow along with my normal pillows, so this item was a waste of money for me. I am hoping to get some use out of it when I start to breastfeed - if so, I'll write another review then :)."
1,Hate this pillow!,"Bought this pillow a few weeks ago and it has been one of the worst purchases I've ever made. It's too uncomfortable to sleep in. Since I bought it, I've lost more sleep and have more neck aches. Not worth it at all!"
2,not sold on this product,This pillow is not for everyone. I am a light sleeper and this pillow ended up waking me up throughout the night. If you move at all you run into some part of the pillow as it is too bulky to move with you. I did not find the head section of the pillow comfortable as I would prefer to have my normal pillow under my head at night. Unfortunately I could not get the Snoogle to turn out of the C shaped position so the head rest section would have to go under your regular pillow and sleeping on two pillows results in a very stiff neck.
1,"Too Big, Too Firm, NOT comfortable",I don't have anything to add...it's very uncomfortable and didn't ease any of my discomfort. I used it for one night.
2,Snoogle pillow,I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it. I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle. I have since returned the Snoogle. I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable. The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me. I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me. I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money.
4,Good purchase,"This pillow works well with my body.The pros: First, I never slept on my side before pregnancy and sleeping on my side started to become very uncomfortable. The pillow supports my back and legs while I use another pillow for my baby belly. I'm a girl hitting 230 so it helps me a lot.The cons- It's frustrating trying to turn or change positions with the pillow, but overall, it's a minor problem. And secondly the pillow case takes forever to get back on. But again, that's a minor problem.I reccomend this to any women who are having trouble sleeping."
4,A Happy Wife Is A Happy Life,I bought this for my wife who's pregnant and she absolutely loves it! She can sleep on her side and still have the support she needs.
5,Love the pillow,"I am 24 weeks pregnant and have started getting uncomfortable in bed. I heard this was the best and most popular pregnancy pillow and I love it! It is definitely big but it's the only pillow I need and I can support my head, belly and legs with just this pillow. I didn't notice the fabric being scratchy at all. It's not silky super soft fabric, but it's just fine for me. And there is a cover on it so I can wash it which is really nice. I imagine this will be nice for breastfeeding as well.I highly recommend this pillow to help with sleeping and making things more comfortable! It's kind of like another person in our bed but it's worth it! It's also pretty pricey but I'm glad I bought it and I have loved it so far."
4,Adequite size with nice shape,"The pillow is quite large, which can probably fit for a person 6' tall. The shape works great with one side holding my neck well and the other side between legs. It does occupy quite some space, but not a problem at all for a king-size bed. The cover is white, which is easy to stain. Fabric is OK but not the most comfortable. Overall a good buy!"
5,not as firm as low reviews say,"Wife loves it, 6 months pregnant and cant sleep without it now... she said it is the perfect firmness for her..."
4,Love it!,"I was about 17 weeks pregnant when I purchased this pillow and I am so glad I did. I was having a lot of back pain at night and needed many pillows to help relive the pain. This brought me down to one main pillow. I still sleep with pillows under my head, but that is for my acid reflux and allergies. I would highly recommend this pillow to not only pregnant women but also to anyone who need more support at night. The only thing I did not like is it does not come with a real pillow cover. There are tags sticking out that bother me while I sleep. I would recommend buying a pillow case to go with it."
1,Unnecessary,"It's hot, unbendable, unforgiving, and no where near as comfortable as using an extra pillow from the guest room. Unfortunately, my husband got it for me as a 'gift' and I'm stuck using this horrible, expensive device."
4,Good buy,"This pillow is great except is kind of hurts my head if I put my entire neck on it...I'm used to sleeping with flat pillows. Other than that, it's very comfortable!! I'll admit it is quite costly though."
1,Too big and uncomfortable.,"I found this beast of a pillow to be way too large and poofy to get comfortable with. I had a kink in my neck after sleeping with it because it kept my head so far off the mattress. I also felt like it was way too big when I tried to use it to support my top leg when sleeping on my side. It was also a huge pain to try and punch into place after getting up to use the bathroom at night, which happens frequently when pregnant. By the time I had it arranged, I was wide awake. I had better luck getting some inexpensive down pillows that I could mold around me as needed for support, and that were easier to get into place after getting up in the night."
2,Helps Backsleepers Adjust - No Cover Included,"Before pregnancy I never slept on my side - and I really don't like side sleeping. The Snoogle has really helped me be able to sleep on my side or sleep on my back but with the snoogle under one side so I'm kind of propped up on it. Sleeping became really difficult in the 6th month and I am very glad I purchased this pillow. One caveat is that you NEED to buy a cover with it - I didn't realize that and ended up trying to wrap mine in a sheet until I had a chance to get a cover. The material is very scratchy and rough by itself: Amazon sells a Snoogle with Cover for $65, but since I had to buy mine separately I ended up paying $82.96 for the exact same thing. Bummer.I have found that mine kept its shape decently well - it's certainly not as soft as my feather pillows, but I was unable to find something like this made of down/feather. Overall, I would recommend this pillow BUT don't buy this one: buy the one that includes a cover at the same time!"
3,Flattens quickly,"Pregnant with twins and have been using this maternity pillow since my 12th week. Now in my 26th week and the pillow is as flat as a pancake and has been since about my 18th week. I put it on tumble in the dryer, but nothing is resurrecting this thing. It still adds a little support, but now I have to use a bunch of extra pillows with it. At the cost, it would have been nice if it could last my whole pregnancy. Maybe it would be ideal for a singleton pregnancy, but for multiples not so great."
5,It's a lifesaver!,"I was so excited to get this pillow that a friend recommended to me. Once I got it, it was the first night in months that I felt like a got a decent night's sleep and didn't wake up stiff the next day. It supports you in all the right places when you need to adjust to sleeping on your side!"
5,The most wonderful pillow ever!,"In my sixth month of pregnancy, I started having a lot of trouble sleeping. My hips hurt, and I could never manage to find a way to keep from rolling onto my back. I had said earlier that I was not going to order a pillow specifically for sleeping during pregnancy, mostly because they all seemed to cost so much. But, I reached the point of desperation, and suddenly the Snoogle seemed like a bargain :) I would have paid almost any amount of money to not hurt at night. I chose the Snoogle because I had heard so many good things about them, both on Amazon.com and some pregnancy chat boards. When it arrived, it took me a few nights of experimenting with positioning, but now I don't know how in the world I slept without it for so long! I don't plan on ever sleeping without it again, pregnant or not!"
2,Doesn't help hip pain,"I bought this thinking it would alleviate my hip pain from the extra weight of the baby but it didn't. Instead, I woke up with a crick in my neck in addition to pain in my hip (the snoogle is hard and a little too large for me to use as a pillow). So I went to Target and bought an egg-crate foam mattress for $12 to put over our usual mattress - it works great! No hip pain, no cricks in the neck!"
5,Finally a good night's sleep!,"I've been tossing and turning for so long now.... I'm 6 months pregnant and finally slept a night thanks to this product with maybe turning over only twice in the night! I could roll over ten times in one hour prior to getting this product. It is a little expensive - Luckily mine was a gift, but I would have hated to pay that price on my own!! But I guess they can charge a lot when they come up with something really good!!"
2,Pillow,I was experiencing hip and shoulder pain while sleeping and that's why I bought this product(I am 26 weeks pregnant).Well the hip problem has not stopped at all.I still wake up in pain in the middle of the night but my shoulders don't hurt anymore.
3,Good for some people,My pregnanat wife really wanted this cause she was using a regular pillow between her legs and read great things about this pillow. She used it for 1 week and found it too bulky and went back to the regular pillow. I guess it's not for all.
4,great night's sleep,"Short of being tangled in it every once in a while, I HIGHLY recommend the snoogle. It helps prevent me from rolling on my back in the middle of the night and gives my hips great support. A must have for pregnant ladies everywhere. And I imagine it'd be great for anyone with back problems!"
1,Body Pillow Not For All Preggos,I bought this for my pregnant wife but she says it does not support her stomach the way she likes. The item came in perfect shape and delivery was prompt.
5,GREAT,"purchased for my daughter who is carring twins..... she can now sleep again. awsome product, now if we can find somthing to help her out of bed :)"
5,A Must Have for Pregnancy,I LOVED THIS PILLOW! So much my husband got jealous of it :o) By second trimester I needed something to help me sleep comfortably and this did the trick. I since passed it down to my sister while she was pregnant and she too agrees it is a must have.
5,Great Pillow,"I have loved this pillow. It gives my plenty of support and I am now sleeping so much better. It supports my stomach, back and head. I highly recommend it."
3,Didn't work for me...,"I think the product overall has good quality but I end up returning it. My main problem was the size, it is really big and if you are the kind that sleeps in one position all night it might work for you but if you need to change positions you will have to wake up and re-arrange the pillow, yourself and probably your husband as well. Too much trouble! Also, the height and thickness of the head area end up on being too tall and hard for me that even gave me a headache.I also tried using it as a back pillow/watch TV/chair type combo and it was very difficult to again, stay in one position to avoid destroying the setting.Thought this could help other women that are just the ""difficult to sleep"" type. I know I am hard to please."
4,A wonderful all-in-one pillow,"Before I got the Snoogle, I was sleeping with 4 pillows (one for my head, one along my back, one to support my stomach, and one in between my legs). Now all I need is this one! Actually I do still sleep with a pillow in between my knees, because the snoogle isn't substantal enough for my spreading pelvis. All, in all a wonderful option to make sleeping more comfortable! The only con (beside still needing a pillow between my knees) is that it is very hard to turn over to your other side with this pillow. What I've started doing is rotating sides each time I get up to use the bathroom."
4,Love this pillow!,"I bought this pillow when I was four months pregnant and I've had it for a month now. I really love this pillow and it has made sleeping a lot more comfortable for me, and keeps me on my left side. The best thing about this pillow is that you can put it into different positions to accomodate you. Whether you want to sit up, lay down, or prop your feet up - this pillow works wonders! One reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because there is an inner crease/stiching where the head goes, and sometimes if you lay on that area unknowingly in your sleep, it will cause you some discomfort. Maybe wraping the stitched area with a blanket will help reduce the discomfort if you lay near that area. My husband and I share a queen sized bed, and we have no problem with the size of the pillow. He's also able to wrap his arms around me at night as well. Perfect pillow - must get for pregnant women...or none pregnant!"
4,Still figuring it out....,"I definitely am happy I received the Snoogle as a bday gift from my sister, but I am still figuring out a few things out - like am I positioning myself correctly? where do i put my head and stomach exactly? how can my husband and i share the space in our queen bed? etc. I am at about 25 weeks, and trying to figure out if I am positioning myself correctly on the pillow, or if i just need my stomach to grow more. sometimes i think all i need is a wedge to shove under my stomach and an extra pillow between my legs. with that said, I do feel more ""cozy"" at night and it does help prevent me from rolling on my back. I am just not sure if it is the ""perfect"" design for me at this current stage in pregnancy."
2,Not for tall people,"I am 5'8 and this pillow was not long enough to go under my head, between my knees, and under my belly. I was also very disappointed with the softness. This is a hard and scratchy pillow. It is also pretty thick, my head was up too high to be comfortable. I normally sleep on a goose feather pillow, so I prefer softness. I was in so much pain when I finally got out of bed after using the snoogle total body pillow. I returned it. I was very hopeful that this pillow would give me a good night sleep, since I haven't been sleeping well since week 16 of my pregnancy. Very disappointed."
5,Wife loved it,I bought this for my wife string or first pregnancy and she loved it. It's huge but it helped her sleep better at night. Definitely a good purchase.
5,Highly recommend,"This Leachco Snoogle is comfortable, been sleeping on mine for 6 months now and pretty soon when baby is born I will use it to wrap around and nurse! Good for more things than one ;) Helps support my hips, back and neck! I have lost all the hip pain from this pillow, life saver."
5,Very Good Pillow,I have bought this pillow for my wife as a pregnancy gift (week 12). She loved it and has been using it for the last 4 weeks. I would highly recommend it even in the early months of the pregnancy. It is also a nice gift idea.
1,Frustrating,"This pillow was a waste of money. One, the shape. I can't figure out why it is this bizarre curly cue shape, personally I think sleeping in it feels confining and uncomfortable and prevents any kind of easy movement. Second, as echoed in reviews, the cover they sell you for it is extremely scratchy and uncomfortable--made of very cheap material. Third, the foam used is of the cheapest grade possible and actually feels like it pushes you out of the pillow because it is overly dense and springy. I am used to memory foam which contours to your joints and is more orthopedically sound. This foam feels like its trying to push against you and push you out of the pillow, which, since the pillow is a big curly cue and trying to stick you back in--feels very uncomfortable. This pillow felt like a vice to me. After one hour it wound up on the floor and I was back with my other three pillow pastiche solution."
5,Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,The Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow is Great! There's so many different ways you can use it and it's comfortable!
4,Very good,"Very good item, however it is larger for my wife. Our full size bed is too small to use it. If my wife uses it, there is no place for me. If you have a Queen size bed, I recommend it."
5,Couldn't sleep without this pillow!,"I am always been a stomach sleeper, so pregnancy sleep was an even bigger struggle than normal. I bought this pillow early on and couldn't sleep without it. My belly rested very nicely on the pillow and placing the rest of the pillow between my legs helped position my body more comfortably. My husband didn't love how much space it took up in the bed, though he would try to steal it on occasion. Near the end of the pregnancy, it became harder to get in and out of bed with the pillow in the way, but I just kept the open side facing out, which made it a little easier. I also found it comfortable to use either side as the pillow, so could easily switch from my right to left side while sleeping without (always) waking up. Definitely recommend this pillow!"
2,helps with knee pain,"No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I haven't tried any other body pillows, so I can't compare, but it seems to help. Early in my first trimester, I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night. I still have some, but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help. I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow, so it isn't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case. Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing, but I'm not sure how it could be improved - it's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off, but would probably be uncomfortable or wouldn't completely cover the pillow.Edit: I liked this pillow at first, but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat. Washing it didn't plump it up enough. I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug. Save your money"
2,Size Matters,The pillow was not helpful for me being that I'm very petite (4ft 11in). Just too much pillow for this littla mamma! I also found it to be very dense; not soft or plushy.
4,Sleepsaver,"This pillow has made sleeping during pregnancy so much easier and more comfortable. Could of minor issues though... I didn't realize that the cover was removable so I used the pillow without washing the cover first. I broke out in a rash on both arms for a day after that. I'd HIGHLY recommend washing first (common sense, but again, didn't realize the cover came off). Second issue is that the cover has already torn after just a couple of months of use. I'll sew up the tear, but the quality of the cover that comes with the pillow isn't great."
4,Great Maternity Pillow!,All I can say is that I LOVE my Snoogle. Lying with it is the only way I can get comfortable these days (7 months pregnant) It cradles my neck and I put it between my legs to take the pressure off of my back. I can't imagine not having my Snoogle to sleep otherwise. No other pillow allowed my to get this comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cover it not the best quality and has already pilled a bit. I still love it though.
4,Comfort worth every penny.,"I am 20 weeks pregnant and have been trying to avoid sleeping on my back. I have had the Snoogle for a week and it's great. Although it's bulky and takes up some room in the bed, it fits me like a glove (I'm 5'7"") and keeps me from sleeping flat on my back. It's soft and comfortable - and in my opinion - worth the expense, esp since I'm only 1/2 way through my pregnancy."
2,Stiff and uncomfortable,"If you plan to get this pillow you will need to buy or make a soft cover for it as the fabric is quite stiff and scratchy especially for those with sensitive skin. The shape of the pillow provides support for your knees and just slightly below but no support for the calves or ankles which is quite uncomfortable because your lower legs are left on a decline(this may be different depending on your height and overall body size, I'm fairly small framed and 5'8""). The pillow is very firm and I prefer a simple body length pillow for what I consider better support and comfort. In my experience (the two nights I tried to use it) I woke up more often than before I bought it in uncomfortable positions and neck pain. I personally felt a little bit trapped and smothered by the large design of the pillow. It's worth a try if you are desperate but I would go with your average fluffy body pillow first."
5,A Must Have!,"The perfect maternity pillow has finally arrived! This has helped so much with back and hip pain. Rolling over is easy (I don't have 10 individual pillows to adjust) and I've been sleeping great.The cover is machine washable and easy to remove and put back on. There are also about a dozen different positions the pillow can be transformed (instructions and pictures come with the pillow), so it's not just for sleeping!"
4,Love it,"I absoluty love this item!!!! It is so comfortable for me to in bed. However it is bulky and takes up some room. But it makes sleeping so much better, my back pain isn't as bad as it was, and i am sleeping more sound. I would recommend it to a friend!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"This pillow is perfect for someone who is pregnant. I use it when I'm sitting up in bed or on the couch to wrap around me and read a book, or just to sleep with. It's not too large for a queen sized bed and I love all the positions it folds into. I love it!"
5,This is an amazing pillow!,"I recieved this as a gift from my mom when I was about four months pregnant, and experiencing a lot of lower back pain. The first night I slept on it, I called my mom the next morning to let her know how amazing it was! I've been sleeping on this for a couple of months now, and while my husband complains about the amount of room I take up on the bed, that's a price I'm willing to pay for getting a comfortable night's sleep. I have missed one night sleeping on this pillow and the entire next day was uncomfortable and experienced back pain. My only concern is figuring out how to travel with it so I'm comfortable while not at home. I have recomended this to all of my pregnant friends, and each of them has only had positive things to say about it."
5,must have!!,This is an awesome item for pregnant women!It is really comfortable and relaxing. I definately recommend this body pillow to my friends!
5,A Must Have For Any Pregnant Woman,"I can't imagine life without this body pillow! My wife wouldn't have been able to sleep without it. I got her this gift after I found out she was pregnant. Little did I know that I'd have to upgrade to a King sized bed, but that was great too! This pillow is awesome. Easy to clean since the sleeve comes off. If anything, the U shaped pillow may have been better because she wouldn't have to turn the pillow everytime she turns, but then you'd probably need 2 King sized beds."
3,No cover included,"The pillow seems great, and it was delivered promptly with Amazon Prime, but despite the description, I did not receive a cover to go with it. Not thrilled about paying another $20-30 for an ""extra"" cover when I thought I'd already bought one with the pillow."
4,Makes restless nights much better!,"Got this yesterday and tried it last night. Had the best sleep since I found out I was pregnant. It takes up about as much space as the body pillow I was previously using but works so much better. Happy to see that it does indeed come with a cover so I didn't have to spend the extra $30 on a cover. Very fluffy so if you're use to not having a fluffy pillow under your head you'll have to learn to rearrange and make your old pillow work with it. Four stars for price. Could be cheaper, but definitely cheaper on Amazon than Babies-R-Us."
3,So comfty- BUT hard to clean and gets lumpy..,"As mentioned in other post: This pillow is fab. But.. will get lumpy and is hard to clean..Pros- contours to your body. Keeps you on your sides. This is the only pillow I use in bed. No more 5 pillows.Cons- Hard to take the cover off that comes with it. Gets lumpy in certain pressure points. (You can however restuff it with stuffing from like walmat. I just tore the seams on the pillow case and through the pillow) Better than taking off the pillow case.. trust me you'll do it one time then will not want to take that thing off an put it back on again lolThis pillow keep me on my side. And thats the only reason I am giving it 4/5 stars. It also gets kind of comfty once it starts to get ""lumpy"". It contours to your body much better."
4,"It's not perfect, but I love it","The snoogle has been indispensable during the last few months of my pregnancy. I use it in addition to my regular pillow to provide extra elevation for my head and neck due to bad heartburn. It provides pretty good back support just rolled up if you want to read/watch tv in bed. As others have pointed out, the pillow case isn't the softest material and it can be a pain to put on, but I think adding a zipper down the length would make the pillow scratchy and defeat its purpose.The Snoogle was a life saver on a recent vacation. Anticipating the reduced quality of a motel mattress and pillows, I packed the snoogle in the car and it was just what I needed to be able to get some rest."
3,Pregnancy Body Pillow,"The Leachco body pillow is okay although I cannot compare it to other body pillows. I say just okay b/c it really has not helped me to get comfortable in bed as I progress through my pregnancy. I wish it were fluffier and the cover that comes with it was not as ""rough"" as some reviewers put it. It is helpful to use when hanging out on the couch and when lying down on the couch as well otherwise, I would tell people to go to an actual store and try out pillows for comfort, ect. b/c when you order on line, you are taking a guess..."
5,Worth the money,"This is a great pillow offering tons of support to help a pregnant woman sleep better. I had a particularly difficult time staying on my side while I slept, and this pillow helped keep me from rolling over onto my back as much. My husband sometimes steals it away from me for napping! The pillow is very flexible and can be wrapped around your body to support you even if you're sitting up in bed. I'm sure I'll continue to use it for sleeping and breastfeeding after my baby's born in January. One thing to be aware of, though, changing the pillowcase is not an easy task, but a necessary one."
5,Must have if pregnant!,"After 5 months being pregnant I could not sleep comfortably anymore. I would have been miserable with out this pillow. One of the best purchases I have made this pregnancy, highly recommended this product as a must have!"
5,Really Help!,"I bought this product for my wide, after her sixth month, she was having a really hard time sleeping. She loved it from the first day."
