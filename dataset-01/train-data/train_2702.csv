4,So far so good,"This is the first time that I am trying WEN. So far its seems like it works really well. I just ordered the styling creme, texture balm, and volumizer. My hair is fine and in need of some volume. As far as the cleansing conditioner, it makes my hair soft and shiney. I think its worth the try."
3,Ok...,"I bought this like expecting a lot but in the end, it's just a normal hair product. It DOES clean my hair- but so does regular shampoo. Although there aren't any sulfates in it, there is alcohol which strips and damages the hair like so many other products. I'm still using it because I spent the money, but I won't reorder it when it's gone. Overall, an expensive product for what it claims to do."
1,Not worth the price tag,"I had high hopes for this product, but was quite disappointed. My hair was soft after I used it, but no softer than after using a $2 conditioner. It also seemed like my hair was actually less manageable after I used it and my hair started to feel dirty (greasy and itchy scalp) soon after using it (the same day). I used it for about 2 weeks, so that I feel like I gave it a fair shot; but now I am back to using my much less expensive shampoo and conditioner and giving the rest of the bottle (over half full) to someone else to try. This product just might not be for my hair type (thick, wavy, short hair), but I probably wouldn't recommend it."
3,not enough,I have long curly hair and this bottle size is just not enough. It;s done in 2 weeks. Smells great but for people whith long curly hair (I'm mixed with Spanish and African) you can get less expensive products that will go a longer way.
2,Not For Me...,"I can see this working for long hair, but for a guy with short hair (about 2"") it just didn't work for me. It was ok, but the SLIGHTEST amount of styling product and my hair gunked up.My other ""issue"" is the $8.50 shipping/handling. On top of $24... ouch."
2,Ahead of support,"The 2006 version has no tech support online and the phone support was less than helpful or seemingly knowledgable. Have tried repeated to install this on a Dell laptop with 1.4 celeron chip, 30 GB hard drive and 384 mg Ram that has worked fine with everything previously installed. This product repeatedly has installation errors towards the end of installation. Phone support merely tries seemingly random fixes, most of which are very time consuming and none of which have worked. Recommend wait few months until support is better."
3,disappointed & it seems to slow my computer down,"I had high hopes for this product. There is no doubt that the content is good , but accessing it is the problem. The full product takes over 4GB which is to be expected , but when it is loaded it really does slow my computer down & I don't have an old system.Also , it is not as quick as wikipedia. The recent debate about which is the better system is still running. Overall, I wld trust EB over the free system , but I do find the free wikipedia(sp?) easier to use & less of a burden on my computer.Overall , if you need a reference system I would find it hard to recommend. I have actually taken off my laptop as it really was 'boggin' every thing else down."
5,For Potential Students,"This book is for any potential students who wish to explore careers in Forensic Science. I purschased this book out of plain curiosity, and this field of science is truly amazing to practically no end. Forensic Science is a fascinating career to discover, and if you are the type of student who needs constant stimulation then you should read this book."
3,"Ace was the ""fuel"" KISS needed...","Ace Frehley demonstrates through this album, as well as his Comet albums, that he had much to do with the distinct sound that KISS came to be known for. Ace is a super guitarist and has a wonderfully unique ""rockin'"" voice. This album is not quite as good as 12 Picks, however, it does demontrate that Ace was clearly responsible for that ""KISS sound"". Rock and Roll, Ace!!!"
4,Functional and beautiful,"Decided to splurge on real cedar shoe trees. Surprise! They really do make a difference. My shoes seem, well, happier than before. Go figure. Florsheim shoes may not be what they used to be, but they sure know how to make (or market) a dang good shoe tree."
3,Economical lighting,"These bulbs give good bright clear light and arrive in perfect condition very quickly after ordering.I must, however, admit, that one exploded and left the glass debris on the floor. Not sure why."
2,Idiosyncratic!,"The writer, in his own view, depicts how art is used through ages to portray the sociological, philosophical, political and economical trends of those particular ages. However, the author fails to see how also art is used in a mercantilist way, without a single clue to express the trendy message of the time, but to become the next big-new thing in the market. Finally, the author sees to much into art to look for reasons and reactions to socio-economic trends here in the US and the world, while in the mind of many artist, their aim to produce a piece that will produce a more comfortable and secure financial present and why not future, is not addressed in this book! I have to add, the research on every artist and piece of art addressed here is thoroughly done, accurate and very well documented. My two stars are actually for his research but not the theme of the book."
1,What's the point?,"He says that ""we seem to be at the end of a long experiment..."" This book is a collection of ridiculous historical observations with an astonishing lack of depth from a constitutional lawyer, and the author rolls over every possible historical event like a steamroller. The book presents itself as history, but it's really the author lamenting the loss of Christian values and how technology has been bad for society. Strange."
1,One of the worst episodes. Season 7 is a big disappointment,"This one was hard to get through.The episode is very silly and boring.200 years ago which is the 22nd century, Native Americans moved to a different planet from Earth.What is funny is these Native Americans that are supposed to be from the 22nd century live and act exactly like older 19th century Native Americans.They are very superstitious, dogmatic and still believe in spirits.If I was watching something else referencing Native Americans like this it would be fine, but this is Star Trek set in the 24th century. It is ridiculous that they would make an episode like this.After Roddenberry died around Season 5 the show went down hill, with season 7 being one of the worst seasons."
2,"Oh no, not ANOTHER Wuss-ley episode?!","Sheesh... I guess it wasn't bad enough that Wussley- whoops, Wesley Crusher brought the NextGen show down a bit when he was a regular, now we discover he's gifted with the ability to shift himself to other dimensions! The Traveler, a being who's alluded to Wesley's burgeoning abilities in two previous eppies, returns here to help him along his path to discovering new realities without requiring a vehicle (as well as making a lotta NextGen trekkies hate his guts). Too bad he didn't show the kid how to shift himself to sci-fi limbo and strand him there forever! But, at least Wes resigned his commission as a cadet, so there is a bit of an upside to this whole sad affair (thus two stars instead of one)...`Late"
4,I forget which episode this is,"I think ""Journey's End"" is one I've seen, but I'm not sure. No matter what, though, you know it's good because it's Star trek."
4,Prom,"I liked this book. I read Speak, which I absolutely loved, and then I read this. It wasn't NEARLY as good as Speak, but I thought it was funny and at least it entertained me without me getting a headache (like The Clique, the whole time I was reading it I felt sick). But, it did seem fairly mediocre compared to Speak.Okay, so Ashley Hannigan is not really a Prom girl, but her best friend loves it. But when the teacher steals the Prom money, Ashley finds herself passionate about making this Prom THE BEST.And so it begins...That was a very short description. And probably not really helpful, looking back it looks like something a teacher would write in an email to get you to read it. But it is really a good book, and if you have time I would recommend it."
1,No.,"How did this happen? Speak was such an excellent book, as was Catalyst. How did Laurie Halse Anderson slip into such a shallow cesspool of bad writing?Prom is shallow, hard to relate to, mind-numbingly boring, and predictable. There is none of Anderson's previous poetic writing. This is NOT A GOOD BOOK.I don't recommend this book. In fact, I strongly recommend you DON'T read it, and rather spend your time on some of Anderson's better books (like Speak.)"
1,Save your time,"While the book was readable, it was nothing special. Had it not been the only book I had on me at the time, I wouldn't of wasted my time. None the less, I finished it and like I said...it was nothing special."
2,What the heck happened to her?,"SPEAK was one of the greatest teen novels I've read. I read it over and over for a few weeks and each time was blown more away by how haunting it was. CATALYST, alhough not as fantastic as SPEAK, was still an incredible teen book. Then there's PROM.This book dives into a Harlem-ish area of Philly where it seems like the rap culture has taken over. Anderson has created one of her shallowest characters and reading this seems almost impossible.Besides a few laughs, the book is garbage and I only recommend it to her TRUE fans."
2,Review...,All I can say is don't buy this book. I was disappointed and thought it was a true waste of money. No where near as good as her other AMAZING books which I recommend you read instead of this!
1,I found this book to be MORALLY bankrupt! SHOCKING!!,"This book promotes everything that parents and teachers DO NOT want their teenagers to do!! The ""heroine"" of the novel disputes authority, sleeps with her boyfriend, gets drunk, stays out late on a school nights wandering around downtown, and then passes out condoms to everyone at her high school prom.The cover photo would have one believe it is a sweet, off-beat prom story when it really isn't. This is NOT a book I'd recommend for anyone; let alone middle school students. Some examples of this books disturbing content are: When Ashley's boyfriend gives her a cell phone, they take off their clothes and go to bed to celebrate, and at the prom, a couple engages in oral sex behind the bleachers. I was shocked to find these things in a book recommended for our youth. This is not the type of morality and behavior I want to instill my children. I am so sorry I bought it! Truly a waste of good money."
4,"Off-beat, down to earth, and very funny","I'm a big fan of Laurie Halse Anderson's novels, but (like most YA authors) she usually writes about teens who are in some way unusual or extraordinary. This is hardly a bad thing, of course, because it makes for an interesting story -- but here, she creates the most ordinary of characters, and makes them remarkable.The story is set in a rough, working-class Philadelphia school, where most of the students have little money, and only modest ambitions for the future. Over the course of the novel, the main characters find unexpected resources within themselves and their community, having a few adventures along the way. The conflicts -- students versus teachers, cliques versus cliques, girlfriends versus boyfriends -- are all handled with sensitivity and humour."
1,Disappointed,"It is hard to believe that the same author who wrote two of the best YA books ever, Speak and Fever 1793, wrote this piece of trash. My disappointment in Anderson is profound and makes me leery to recommend her outstanding books for fear of leading young people to this garbage. This book represents the antithesis of what our society hopes for from it's young people."
1,Atonal Amelia,"Amelia's trademark is taking all directions literally without applying reason. This time she has the insane notion that she's going to play in the school band. Naturally she bollixes up the works and the show ends on a sour note - literally, thanks to Amelia's blundering miscalculations. Since baking is her strength, perhaps the conductor will relent if he eats some of her desserts."
4,Memory Bracelete,Product was very nice. The poem that is with the bracelet was very moving. A good gift instead of flowers.
5,Love and Kisses...Bimbo Jones,"Are there any guys out there that ever ""get it"". In this film, one of them actually realizes the differences between a fling, a fraud and a floozy and he actually chooses to love the girl that is just herself...kind, caring and intersted in him. Geraldine Page is one of the greats and this performance is lesser known than the others, but it is pulled together beautifully by this wonderful artist. You actually feel the expectaion, the heartbreak, the resignation and the blissfulness of this free spirit, content upon being herself and finding love before she is too old. I cry every single time I see this film...tears of joy that a guy could cut through the chaos of his life and libido and actually fall in love with the woman he might not have selected for himself, but discovers is his perfect match.Wonerful and recommended very highly."
5,MY FAVORITE MOVIE,RECEIVED IN GREAT CONDITION. EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY AROUND. WOULD BUY AGAIN. A+++++
5,A great movie with a great cast,It is difficult to find this exceptional movie. It is too bad it is not available on DVD. Glenn Ford and Geraldine Page complement each other beautifully in this touching middle age love story.
2,Geraldine Page is over-rated,"The movie was not what I expected. Too much screen time was spent on Ms. Page and her character did not make any sense. It was a bit corny. However, Glenn Ford was outstanding as usual. He should have been paired up with a younger, smarter leading lady."
4,Page and Ford make a delightful pair in an off-beat romance.,"I cannot remember how many times I have watched the movie late at night, crying and laughing throughout. I like Page's ""spinster"" who shows the secret desires and wishes of such women. As she and Ford grow closer, she blossoms into a truer form of herself. Ford is both charming and comical in his predicament. He is falling in love while already engaged to be married. I found this movie unpredictable and engaging. I have even gotten my two teenaged sons to watch on occasion. They like it also.I never grow tired of viewing it. Yes, it is blatantly sentimental with a happy ending. So what!! I like movies that end that way. Then I turn off the late show and go to sleep with a smile on my face."
3,Decoys,"Seina and his shipmates are still traveling through space acting as pirate bait. They accidentally stumble upon the most feared space pirate of all, Ryoko Balta. This isn't the Ryoko we remember. She's attacking fiercely. I would say it looks like the end, but the series is only half over.This volume isn't bad or good. It's just average. The whole series has very rushed and average feel to it. I did, however, like the new character, Ryoko Balta. Some of the other characters in this series are okay too. Overall they are not developed well enough to make you love them. This series is kind of a waste of time really. There are many more anime shows out there that need attention first."
5,vol 4,"I bought this to help me complete my Tenchi GXP collection. I love this movie/series. Didn't think that I would, since I'm usually not a fan of spin-offs--especially not when it comes to my beloved Tenchi series, but this is still as funny as the original, but has new characters and new adventures. We don't see much of the main cast, but they do make a few return appearances. Just as perverted as the regular Tenchi cast, I'm glad that I bought this--bundle of laughs on every disc!"
5,"Inspiring, challenging. You'll grow or put the book away!",Absolutely the most challenging book I have read this year! It has made me evaluate how I look at the things around me and how I interpret events in my life. I have been more transformed into the image of Christ because of this book and I highly reccommend it to anyone who is serious about dying to flesh and living for Christ.
5,MAD about this album,"I grew up with this record in the house. My parents got it when I was a kid, long before cassettes, 8 tracks, or CDs. A very good record of musical satire, from Anvils Of Course (Anvil Chorus), and the Mad Fan's Square Dance, to Mr. Greene's Bee (Flight of the Bumblebee), and Two Guitars, a Banjo and a Mandolin ... no, it isn't what it sounds like, it is the song Two Guitars played on a banjo and a mandolin. If you like the satire of P D Q Bach, you will love this record."
4,"Character, plot, humor, great writing, big bang ending.","Having really enjoyed ""Players"" by Clay Reynolds, I thought I would give ""Rage"" a try. I'm glad I did. You can see that ""Players"" didn't just happen. Reynolds has been working at his craft for several years now, as evidenced by the great writing in ""Rage"". The humor in Reynolds' books is hysterical"
1,Delete immediately to Recycle Bin then Empty Trash,"Rich Tennant has created a Far Side type collection of cartoons set around an office especially computers. Although Tennant copied Larson's style he could not duplicate either his quality or humour. In fact I did not find one cartoon in this entire collection funny. Don't waste your money, buy a Far Side book instead."
4,Worked great.,Completed my needed repair on my Polaris. Would tell a friend about this item and how it worked for me.
1,This camera sucks!,"The biggest problem of this camera, the lens won't come out reliably. You may have to try on/off couple times. My wife always joke this camera, it need Viagra. When you need it to work, it won't erect."
2,Just bad pictures,"The camera is perfect, except the pictures are bad. I've owned an Olympus digital camera, which was admittedly larger, but took great pictures. I had to return this one and keep looking because all of the pictures I took (with very few exceptions) came out very blurry."
3,Fine pix OK for OK pictures...,"Purchased the 6800 at the same time a friend bought a Olympus 3030. I really liked the looks, size and features on the Fuji. Unforunately, we went and did a side-side comparison of pictures taken of the same objects at different lighting levels, and distances ( macro etc ).I was quite amazed at the difference in picture clarity between the Fuji and the Olympus. The fuji pictures looked very nice - but when compared, the image clarity was not close. edge definition and sharpness was a whole different level in the Olympus.So sadly, I had to switch ( I really did like the size and style of the Fuji - image quality is more important to me )."
5,Excellent image capturing device,"I have got FujiFine Pix 4700 and Mx2700,too.Fujifilm have come up with something extraordinary design.This camera is beautifully designed and decidedly sleek and image quality so far is the best in point and shoot digi cams. Prices are reasonable for this engineering marvel.I wish I could give this camera more than five points."
3,Terrific Webcam,"I've owned the 6800Z for about 10 years, but it was kept in the drawer after I bought smaller Sony and Lumix digital cameras with better technology/picture quality. That being said, it is a terrific WEBCAM for my PC. The camera comes with a cradle and has a USB mode that is easily recognized by Windows. I use it routinely for Skype calls and it hasn't let me down over the past 4 years. Yes, it was pretty expensive when I bought it over 10 years ago (~$500), but it's one of the few digital products I've owned that is still in routine use after a decade!PS: Do not bother with this device for picture/video use these days. There are too many much more effective options readily available. Also, the memory cards used in this device are rare and costly these days, making it rather ludicrous for use other than as a webcam."
2,911 enthusiast's companion 1989-1994,"no real usable data for repairs, a coffee table book on the 964 at the most."
4,"Not Front Row, but Backstage","Those expecting an exhaustive tomb of runway snapshots should look elsewhere. Indeed, even if such a book did exist, it would certainly do nothing to elucidate the significance of Margiela's contribution to fashion.What this book does so well is to provide an entre to the designer's world, from inspiration, to creation, down to the very stitch and seam of his clothing. One is instantaneously struck by the simplicity and humility of his designs (a tank top made from a mesh laundry bag, boots with cloven hoofs), and yet is left more awed by not having noticed the world in this way before.My only reservation in not giving this volume the highest marks is for the fact that many of the typography is extremely difficult to read. The white-colored text is printed directly on the photographs, which inevitably will lead to problems when the background color matches or closely matches the over-laid text."
4,It's all about design...,"A greatly designed book with loads and loads of photos.. If you love Margiela, then this book is a must!... Be caught by his designs, his personal and unique view of clothing..."
1,BAD!,"I once I opened it, it smelled funky, only did I come to the realization that the white bottle was broken of some sort and all the liquid spilled onto the other items.Very bad. Never buying again."
5,Digital SLR Camera cleaning kit,I received the product real quick. The cleaning kit is awesome! (I have not used it yet)
5,Great CD's,"These CD's teach something not taught alot today. Most christians today are so busy trying to become better people that they forget that no matter how hard we try, we will always be sinners. The Bible says we must be dead to ourselves and alive in Christ. Our love is selfish and willnot satisfy. Gods love however is wonderful and perfect.Very Helpful Set"
5,must read,I went through this book with the study guide in a women's bible study group and haven't been the same since. I highly recommend it. It gave me not only a new perspective on God's love but practical tools for applying God's love in every day situations. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 6.
4,Love the principle,I love the principles in this book the only problem I found was she seemed to expound a bit too much. She could have said the same thing in less wording and had the same if not a better impact. I also ffelt that the idea of always needing to find a place to talk to the Father a bit unrealistic.I think she had alot of great ideas and encouragement that worked in her marriage. I believe she had the right idea but the implementing is my issue. There isn't just one way to repent of sin and find ourselves reconnected with the Father again. I will keep this book though because I need reminding that the love we need to have is Agape (unconditional) love. And that only comes from God's Spirit living in me.
5,It does exactly what it says.,To those giving low stars because it only lasts 3 hours just isn't right. It states on the box that it only lasts 3 hours so don't be surprised that it doesn't last longer. I use this for screen printing to expose my images and it works perfectly. If you screen print a lot buy a few of these at a time incase one burns out on you.
3,The Cover is nice.,I like the pillow on the cover. The rest of the projects are less interesting and fairly basic.
5,OUTSTANDING BUY,"RECEIVED GOOD SERVICE AS PROMISED. GOOD PRODUCT. ONLY PROBLEM IS INK CARTRIDGES ARE MUCH TOO SMALL. THIS MAKES IT VERY EXPENSIVE TO USE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRINTING. OTHERWISE, IT DOES A GOOD JOB."
4,HP Officejet 6310,This printer is great! Thanks! It prints fast! The quality of printing pictures is awesome! Fax works great! Copying is pretty fast! One of the reasons I bought this printer was the PRICE! Another is because the cartridges you can find is cheaper than the Lexmark cartridges!!!Thanks !
5,Really great multi-function device!,I really liked this multi-function device from HP. It was easy to setup and the foot print compared to a prior HP multi-function device is much smaller. The print speed is also VERY fast. I have no compliants about this unit. I would choose it again.
3,Good Printer but heavy on Ink,The printer gives excellent quality. I got about 500 pages out of the ink cartridges before having to change them. Deliver was good. Haven't faxed or copied yet as I ran out of ink after the first job (500 pages).
3,Ok unit as long as you don't use it often...,"I purchased this HP 6310 March 2008. Right away it installed just fine, and worked great. Printing, scanning, faxing, all excellent. As time went by, my work load increased and I have learned that although the price of the unit was competitive my toner cost for this year will be $200.00Don't try to put too much paper in the paper feeder or it will jam. About 20 sheets is the max, regardless of what the directions say.Don't like junk-Email ? Watch out, you will be barraged with ads for this product from HP with limitless updates, which I suspect do nothing for the performance of the printer. Almost everyday I have some update from HP, I began to suspect it's just ads.Although this unit works fine, it cannot handle my work load now. It would be great for someone who does not print every day all day long, as I am now.Bottom line, I'm looking for a new all-in-one that can work all day and not run thru toner every month.Any suggestions?"
1,"Jammed, jammed, jammed","I've owned a number of printers, including an earlier HP Officejet all-in-one that lasted for years. This one, more expensive than a lot of printers I could have chosen, is a huge disappointment. Not only does it lack the handy feeder for envelopes (you have to unload and reload), it simply won't print them without jamming. I've tried putting in fewer, more, etc.Many labels and card stocks also jam, and those papers are expensive! About every 10th sheet it feeds in two to three sheets, printing a bit on each one. About every 100th sheet of regular paper it jams. No, I really don't think it's me. Have had no major probs with previous printers.Also it seems to eat ink. Will seriously think of getting something other than HP in future. I've had it about a year and can't wait for it to totally break down so I can replace it."
5,Love this product,"I've had my hp laserjet 6300 for just over a month. It's an amazing machine. Able to do so many wonderful functions,and it takes up such a small space. The printer is very quiet and fast. The fax is easy to use. I haven't used the photo copy or scanner yet. But I'm confident I will have no problems. Very easy setup."
1,A bit junky,"More low end junk from HP. I've had numerous problems with this printer mostly related to the print cartridge error issue, which is well documented. Unfortunately I don't the time required to try and get this thing to work every few days. It's getting tossed into the trash at the first opportunity. Print cartridges are insanely expensive too and require frequent replacement even for low usage. I would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason."
2,not so hot HP,I have had HPs forever but this one is not good. It says it works with MACS but it won't do 2 sided printing nor will it FAX. Yes I have tried everything. I can't find any record of my purchase tho it was only a few months ago and I got it here so I guess I am screwed. I don't know if I would get another HP after this for my MAC - too bad.
3,Until working great -- once stopped means stopped,"It works for 3 years without any problem, but once it has problem that is the end of it's life. I do not know if it only happens to hp(s) or other printers too. My two hp all in one printers just died after 3 years."
1,HP OJ 6310 AIO,"The HP OJ 6310 AIO Printer would print, but would not scan photos or documents. After hours on the telephone with a technician in India, he gave up and promised that another technician would call me. No one ever did. So, I really don't feel that I can recommend the printer to anyone."
3,Good value for the money,"Pros:- Small and portable.- Uses external transformer (110V-220V)- Decent print and scan qualityCons:- Slow printing / copying speed- Unlike network printer where you can just install the driver and start printing from the network, scanning over network requires you to install the monstrous 300mb hp software which runs some kind of window services in order for network scanning to work."
1,Farewell to my allegiance to HP,"I have owned 3 all-in-one HP printers over the years and intended to replace the G85 with the 6310. While checking out the features of the 6310 we noticed that the multipage document feeder did not pull the documents into the printer. The unit seemed to be copying ok when a single sheet was placed on the glass and printing and fax were ok. When I opened the unit to look for anything unusual I noticed the ink docking trays had accumulated a small pile of ink and this was unacceptable. We had the same problem with the G85 which is why we replaced it. However, the G85(a very good unit by the way)was a few years old, not just a few days like the 6310. The 6310 was returned and we bought the Canon Pixma MP810 and are we glad because the quality of construction surpasses the 6310 even thought the unit cost a little more."
1,"Cheap Item, Poor Software, Worse Support","I didn't purchase this one...it was a gift. I was hoping for a laser printer like one of the Brother All-In-Ones.I opted to install the Lite version of the software from hp.com. I would suggest that everyone do this. The Lite version only has the drivers, none of the HP bull software that is included usually.The thing that bothered me the most was the Automatic Document Feeder. I would start a scan job and everything is going fine, and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang. I had over 500 pages of documents to scan, and this machine really let me down.Amazing how Hewlett-Packard can't even write reliable drivers.I gave the item 2 stars because I got it to print sometimes. No buy."
4,nice little machine,"I have only had this machine for a short while but have been very happy with it. I set it up as a network machine which was very easy. The scanning is good, the speed is good, the copies come out nice. I haven't sent a fax yet, but the instructions look easy"
3,"HP 6310 a So So, All-in-One","This printer installed easily on my computer. The time from print command to actual print is a little slow. The Photosmart Premier software did not install correctly on my Windows XP. After speaking with their tech support in India several times, it became obvious that a new hard copy of the Premier software is needed. It's been eight weeks, and I'm still trying to get the CD from HP to correct the problem. The other photo software works just fine. All in all this printer is not a bad value for the money, but there may be better options out there."
1,Flakey Product!,"I bought two of these from two different locations. I bought one for my office and it worked so well out of the gate that I went and immediately bought another for home.Within the first several months, the first one self-destructed at the hardware level.Within 6-9 months, the second one flaked out at the software level.Worse, I called HP tech support and they claim the ethernet connectivity does not support switches!"
1,Monopoly in Action,"Only buy an HP printer if you're willing to pay their high ink prices. I bought the 6310 after my previous HP printer bit the dust (after only 3 years). The 6310 happened to use the same color cartridge as my old printer (one reason I bought the 6310). But when I put the cartridge in my new printer, I kept seeing thin blue lines on my printouts and aligning the cartridges didn't help.So I contacted HP support. Without going into all the details, I determined that HP is ""locking"" out remanufactured cartridges by having their HP software print blue lines. When I run a test page from the printer (i.e. not through the computer), there are no blue lines and my cartridge worked fine in the old printer . . . so it's NOT the cartridge no matter what HP says. It's a monopoly in action!!!"
1,avoid this machine,"just upgraded from my older 6110 all-in-one to the 6310 because of continuous error messages, grinding noises, interruptions, etc during scanning. My 2 yr. service contract for the 6110 w/ Staples just ran out. I could have gotten a new software service contract with HP for $55.00 for one year or 2 weeks to resolve my specific problem at $30.00 (neither contract covers hardware.) But for circa $250 why not get a new 6310 and an extended contract for another $35.00 from Staples?Boy was I pissed when the 6310 gave me the same error messages that I got on my 6110, and cut off in the middle of a scan the second time I used it. Nuff said. Still looking for a good all-in-one."
2,Drivers...,"The product appears to be everything one would want in a printer - the problem is the drivers. Not only do the drivers take 700+ MB of disk space which is outrageous, but they crash often. In addition, the programs that come with the printer are unstable. Good hardware, poor drivers make this a pass."
1,NEEDS TO GO TO REHAB FOR ITS INK DRINKING PROBLEM,This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Useless over the network,Don't buy the HP 6310 if you expect to connect to it using the ethernet interface. After three install attempts and one hour of web chat with HP support the only function I could access from my PC was printing. Fax and copy only worked directly at the 6310. Scanning and status locked up the PC software. I returned it the next day. I have used several HP printers for years and this experience was disappointing and frustrating.
1,"loved it, but then...","It started off as an easy, user-friendly all-in-one. For black and white printing it's fast and efficient.But make sure you set your defaults or else you'll find your ink gone before you even get going.It eats ink like no other printer I've ever known and when you reload it performs a useless, ink eating alignment page. Then the next 40-odd colour pages come out streaky and unusable before eventually settling itself.I wish I was joking.It is frustrating and expensive, not just on the ink but paper as well. Not to mention the amount of your own time wasted."
4,HP officejet 6310 All-in-One Multifunction Printer/FAX/Scanner/Copier,Very good Unit .... Software Installation had to be run 3 times to complete installation(suspect bad software disk).
2,great color copies but little else,"I had high hopes for a brand like HP, and have been soooo disappointed. Printing, scanning and copying are slow, ink runs out fast, paper is tricky to load, you must leave the machine on ALL THE TIME in order to receive faxes, rollers pull two pages at once to print (a lot of waste), It does make great looking copies, however."
1,"Just, terrible...","By far, the worst printer I have ever used.It is an absolute pain to connect to a network, or set one up through this printer - if you even get to that point.Scanning is an atrocious process. 9 times out of 10, it always hangs. Often, I can't even get the thing to produce a scan to begin with!Worst of all is the constant ""Carriage Jam"" and ""Cartirdige Error."" These happen nearly every single time after I print something, forcing me to reset the printer. Even upon resetting it still usually says one or the other. I've went the whole nine yards to see if something needed to be repaired and nobody was able to find anything wrong with it.Complete junk."
3,my response to your request for product review,"It is too soon for us to know exactly how well this particular equipment is working, since my father-in-law is trying to upgrade his computer to comply with the needed OS configurations to use the various features of the printer.It seemed to work properly when used with my laptop as a test."
2,Not recommemded-HP 6310 All In One Printer,"HP Officejet 6310 All-in-One PrinterHP 6310 works well when it works! When problems arise, it will cost you money if out of warranty. At every turn, HP wants money for info and service the quality of which is questionable. Common problem seems to be flashing ""reset power"" and ""camera"" icon which are difficult if not impossible to overcome. I am at a point where I will have decide to pay for ""service"" the ultimate cost unknown or chuck it into the trash. I am leaning towards getting rid of it and replacing it with a highly rated EPSON.INK IS EXPENSIVE!"
4,6310 all in one printer,It worked great for about 5yrs. Then The left side cartridge gives errors left and right.It says this cartridge is not intended for this printer. I tried all the Hp solutions cleaning them contacts and none of them work. Google left side cartridge for this printer. And see all the problems people have with this printer.I knew the cartridge was good and I knew I wasn't out of ink. Finally I took a screwdriver and tapped the cartridge a couple of times. and now it seems to be working fine again.
2,Finicky - Don't recommend,"Had high hopes for this printer. Seldom use, but frequently needed to reinstall. Doesn't recognize ink cartridges and then doesn't want to operate. Jams regularly."
4,sewinglady4u@yahoo.com,"I ordered a HP 6310 from Amazon. I had a 6310 before and I was satisfied with the new one, I can tell you that so far I have good results with this one. Thank you Amazon for being so prompt and resonable with your price. Who said you have to buy any thing new anymore. I thank you so much with my printer, and if i need anything else I will contact you for help Thanks again Janice D. Jones"
3,HP OfficeJet 6310 All-in-one Printer is truly All-in-one,I had been using the All-In-One for over 2 years. Due to heavy usage I had to begin looking for another product for replacement. I was glad to find the product was still available through Amazon and I purchased it immediately. When I received the product the roll-out time was very minimal. Got back to work very quickly. Thank you.
5,Great All In One!,This is a terrific all in one printer. It was very easy to set up and network. The fax has 20 spaces to save frequent numbers. The buttons are large enough to use without accidentally pushing the wrong number. This is an all around great machine.
1,I'm sure it would be great if it worked.,"I've had this printer for two years now. As time goes on it seems to work less and less. I've had to re-install the drivers multiple times. The HP software doesn't even work well with it's own hardware. I initially had it connected to a network; however, over time, without changing any settings, I could no longer connect to it. Frustrated I finally managed to get it to work by directly connecting it through a USB cable. This worked for about 6 months with software difficulty. And as time goes on, again with out changing any settings or any major SW updates, even directly connecting has stopped working.I do not recommend HP printers, especially this one. I have had other models and have family with other models, and I have spent more time with tech support than actually using them. Find something more reliable."
1,nothing but problems,I bought this the end of 07 . My husband who is computer savy connected it for me. It has been nothing but problems for me. I have windows vista and that might not be helping. The software up date every day and then almost every day there is problem . It will say not connected to the computer although nothing has changed. I have restarted the computer some days it works somedays nothing. Today it will not scan telling me there is no connection yet again. Yesterday it was printing today it will not. I have had my husband look at it and he said it is impossible. The HP assistant that comes up is useless. There are times it comes up with nothing. Do yourself a favor and by something else.
2,Not thrilled with this product,"This All-in-One is a nice looking, compact product. It was easy to set up. The cover for the scanning area feels flimsy and I am not happy with the paper feed. It feeds two pieces of paper at a time even if I fan the paper prior to loading it. It is hard to judge how far to actually push the paper in when loading it. If the paper is pushed too far in it will cause a paper jamb. Clearing jambs?? Not EASY!!!! Even though the description tells the speed of copying - one does not realize how S L O W it actually is. Overall... not worth the $199 I paid for it. Sorry HP, I have always liked the other HP products I have purchased in the past!"
1,HP sure isn't what it used to be!,I purchased this all in one to replace my HP T45 which was great until Windows XP came along. XP and the T45 drivers don't like each other and have become an issue (and HP won't update because they'd rather me buy a new machine!). Anyhow ~ purchased this on Wednesday evening - spent 2 hours getting it all to work (problems with fax). Checked everything out and it all worked. Turned it off and went to bed. Woke up Thursday morning and went to show my husband how to use the fax and it won't work! Tells me the cartridges are jammed and/or paper jam. Neither problem exists. Did everything suggested by the manual and on line before contacting HP service. HP service sent me a list of things to try - the same things i've already done! I'm returning the unit today and looking at the Canon MP830. They sure don't make them like they used to!
1,The worst ever - HP you lost my business!,I have been a longtime fan of HP All-in-one's. This one changed my mind. I tend to buy the newest and keep it until it is way past due for replacement. I bought this when it first came out as my last HP All-In-One was no longer compatible with my new software no matter how many patches I added.I had it about 6 months and then the plastic on the paper tray started to bend. I took it apart and tried to resituate it and it just never went back in. So I printed for a few months with the paper spewing out across the floor. Then the noises started. I lived with that for a while and then finally the print train just stopped moving.That was the end of my 15 year relationship with HP! A printer should not just die like that after less than a year... I wasn't even using it daily.My recommendation - keep your money...for something else
1,HP 6310,"I do not recommend the 6310. I've had it about a year and now the ""Reset Power"" consistently flashes. HP has no answer for it. This is my last HP printer. They owe it to their customers to come up with a fix or replace the unit."
2,0fficejet 6310 beware,"If you're thinking about buying -beware if you're running Vista. The scanning function does not work with Vista and HP doesn't have a clue how to fix the problem if they even care. Also, don't let HP Tech dept work on your computer-they're incompetent. Look elsewhere for an AIO perhaps the 6500 or another brand."
4,"Durable All-in-One, Worth It Despite the Ink Cost","This is an April 2009 edit: we have had our HP 6310 now for 2-1/2 years and it has scanned close to 1500 pages, copied many hundreds, faxed several hundred, and printed over 6000 pages, i.e., 12-15 reams, and is still plugging along just fine. It has worked well, e.g., scanning old financial records and both color and BW family photos into either pdf or jpg files. The ink is expensive, perhaps costing us $50 every three months or so, although we've recently switched to using after-market inks, which seem to work well and are considerably cheaper. The colors come out fine, and we also print out photos on special paper occasionally, which come out looking good. Overall, the versatility and durability, so far, of this unit, has made it a really worthwhile purchase."
1,Big Paperweight,"I won't ever be purchasing another HP Printer. This printer is SLOW at scanning. SLOW at copying. It takes about 1 minute to make 1 copy. - And im not kidding.The paper tray is a joke.The Software disk provided wouldn't even load on 2 different networked machines. The Downloaded drivers CRASHED both systems. When you strip out all the bloatware to just use the driver - it causes constant instability with the network and the PC's when booting, constantly giving DLL errors with the driver pack.I sent it back.And Remember.... you only have 30 days to return it, after that, HP has to service it IF...they deem it has an issue."
2,Driver too large,Driver for this printer is 163mb. Driver for Canon Pixma is 10.3 mb. If only I had known!!
4,Good all-in-one with a few drawbacks,"I am generally satisfied with this unit, especially considerng what I paid for it. But I do wish it would load my entire document into memory BEFORE dialing the fax number. It also suffers from what virtually every other piece of electronic equipment does today - documentation that is written for someone with a third grade education rather than actually being useful."
3,"Okay, but beware of HP","Although this product has not give me any difficulties and was easy to set up and use, I would caution you if you are thinking about purchasing any HP product. Their customer service is poor. Most of their products are good for the warranty period of a year, but then you start to have problems (and you will soon after the year). You can get free help online, but they just try to blame it on someone else and rarely actually fix your problem. Instead, they want you to opt for the $35 charge to speak to an actual person, instead of someone online in India. They seem to always be trying to get money from you. It is frustrating. I should have learned not to buy an HP after going through this with the last two HP printers, but I thought maybe I just had one poor experience...unfortunately, it has happened again, and again I am a frustrated customer. If you want a printer for a year, this is an okay product...if you want it longer, I would look at a different manufacturer."
1,False Claim,This product was advertised as New but was a replacement missing needed parts. I tried to resolve the issue with Amazon and the company selling it with NO HELP at all! I will never order from your site again.. Lesson learned!
4,HP Printer,"HP printers are good quality and this one is no difference. Not sure why, but it seems that about once a month it will not scan which means I have to uninstall the program and reinstall. That usually takes about 45 minutes. Must have some kind of bug but have never been able to figure it out and have maintained updates for this printer.Of course, the only other negative is the cost of purchasing the ink refills. HP makes their money on ink...not printers...so plan on the cost. The default for printing is ""normal"", which uses a lot of ink. Go into the setting and set the default to ""fast draft"" when you don't need HIGH quality. That will cut your ink costs in half."
2,Poor Scanner,"Not very happy with this AIO. I hate the scanner output. If you want to scan something like a passport, half the page is near BLACK!!! I had a very similiar HP Photosmart AIO and it produced great scans, I was expecting the Officejet to be even better."
1,Never able to install,"Hours. Hours I spent trying to install this printer for my mother.Her computer runs XP, she has DSL, and we were connecting through a USB.Every time the software got 3/4 of the way through the installation, it would stall and lock up the computer.I used the help information provided by HP which involved messing with config files, which I'm not particularly comfortable with. Instead of resulting in a successful update, I ended up having to completely restore her computer.It was all very frustrating. We're going to try the Canon Pixma instead."
3,be careful with paper jam,"I had one paper jam in 6months. eversince then, screen kept saying ""paper jammed"" although there was no perper at all. Manual said you shouldn't remove a jammed paper from the front, should use back door because the feeder is very sensitive. I pulled out a peper when only the begining of the paper was jammed. I thought that shouldn't completely ruin the feeder though it's very sensitive. I had to return it because there was no way to fix it. Otherwise it had nice functions, fast, pretty fast wireless response. I liked it except the sensitive paper feeder."
1,Bad product - can i put zero stars!,"Worked ok for a year with very little use. After warranty expired (1 year). I got a ""reset power"" error. This is a fatal error. Do a google search: HP6310 all-in-one with this error ""reset power"" and see the feedback from dissatisfied existing HP 6310 all-in-one owners before purchasing this product. You are warned. Worst purchase i ever made!!!!"
1,Never buying an HP Printer again!,"I've tried to install this Printer on several machines running Windows XP via Ethernet and every time on each machine there has been a problem with the installation (which btw takes about 25 minutes to complete).This scanner's TWAIN driver does not work well at all with any version of Adobe Acrobat Writer (I've tried versions 5, 6.0, and 7.5). One cannot scan documents directly from Adobe Acrobat to create a file. HP Support does not recognize this as their issue. As I am someone who relies heavily on Acrobat Writer (which costs twice as much as this printer), I cannot tolerate this incompatibility.I am sending this printer back and going with my father-in-laws advice. ""HP is no longer a quality product, but another brand like Brother""Overall, I am very disappointed in this product. It is sad to see that my old HP Bubble Jet Printer (which is 10 years old and still working fine), is built with a much higher standard of quality than this current 6310."
1,Worst printer I have used,"No more HP printers for me. It's supposed to be the best brand out there, but my first all-in-one experience from them is quite disappointing. The scanning, copying and faxing features work great. But once in a while it prints all types of junk characters esp. when printing from web pages. Paper tray periodically picks up several pieces of paper at once. It is really annoying when you are trying to print important documents from the web and it just doesn't print anything humanly readable."
1,Piece of junk,"Bought this to replace an older HP fax/print/copy unit. All I can say is WOW, what a piece of junk. Expensive consumables and has to be the SLOWEST office combo on the market. I'm not kidding; the older combo from HP must have been at least 10 times faster for making copies. Even at the fast (low res) setting it must be 5 minutes to make a copy. After this I am swearing off HP combo systems."
1,Unfixable printer jam !,This printer jammed after only 12 pieces over a period of one month. It happened the day after I disposed of the packing box. It has been checked by a lot of techs and now I don't know how to return it or where to return it. Nothing against Amazon but I could find no paperwork in the package telling me how to return it.
1,a heavy drinker - save your money,"Unfortunately I read through all the available reviews AFTER I bought the 6310 all in one. I was coming off a Brother all in one (that was wonderful, fast, WITHOUT a huge appetite for ink) I now know that I should have stuck with Brother. This is the worst printer I have ever had! It is soooo slow and the ink usage is outrageous. I called the company because I thought I must have something set wrong - I went through a black cartridge in 3 days (I do print a lot sometimes). The tech at the company kept telling me what a good printer this was - it had been around for years. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! or check out the all in one Brother that is available. I am looking for a new one and will be giving this away - I have had it for 2 months and have spent more on ink than I did on the machine itself."
5,Works Great!!!,"I purchased this printer about a month ago. It is great. Prints well, easy to use. I like the feature that let's you test the fax to see if you have a dial tone and it's ready to send and receive faxes. My wife used it to print some photos and some invitations. Had no problems at all."
4,Important tip,"We are satisfied with this machine for a home use. However the beginning was not so pleasant. A USB cable you need to buy separately. We bought a usual one and it couldn't establish connection to my PC. Failed time by time. The girl from support center spent two hours and finally recommended to change a USB cable. So, we had to spend another money and to buy a new, HP USB cable. I couldn't believe that that was a problem, but it worked smoothly.Tip: don't waste money, buy only HP usb cable to this machine."
1,Uninstallable Printer !!!!,"My experience with the HP 6310 was a disaster. After installing/uninstalling for 7 days, I could not get this printer to work correctly. I spent many hours with HP email support. They would send directions to complete on the 4th day that they sent me on the 1st day !I am by no means a stranger to computers, so if you are, beware this printer...."
1,Reset power error renders this unit useless,"This was a pretty neat printer. Shortly after we put it in service, the reset power error happened, with all the front panel lights flashing. Power off, power back on, and all is well. That generally lasted weeks. The printer did a generally good job. The copier too. The fax too.The scanner software stinks, allowing you to scan one page and then reboot your computer before doing the next.The longer we owned the unit, the power reset problem became more frequent. Now, today, after the unit is out of warranty, the power reset problem cannot be remedied. I cannot use the unit. Apparently, this is a common problem with these units. Search the web and see numerous others with the same issue.So far, HP has not been helpful, but I'll give them another week. Then I'll be buying a non-HP printer/copier/fax to replace this unit. It's got some engineering problems. Mine will end up in the landfill."
1,Do NOT buy this printer,"This is the single worst piece of crap ever produced. Random errors, jams, fuzzy scans, and every other ridiculous problem you can have. Buying this abomination of engineering is aking to burning money. STAY AWAY."
1,Not worth it in the long run,"I'm on my 2nd HP-6310, but I think I'm done with HP printers, or for that matter anything from HP at all. My first 6310 worked OK, even though it was a resource hog with all the bloat-ware that gets installed when you set it up for the first time. That printer lasted about two years before it started filling every other printout with streaks of random garbage.Mistakingly, I bought a 2nd 6310, since the it was on sale at Staples at the time and it it had all the features I was looking for (fax, copier, network interface), and the previous one had worked OK before it started causing problems.This one now jams immediately when printing photos, using the exact same HP photo paper that we had used with the last one.There was a time when Hewlett-Packard was a Great American Company. They have long ago, however, made the jump from a being a printer manufacturer to just being a seller of overpriced ink."
1,worst printer I've ever owned,"This is the worst printer I've ever owned. The copies are beautiful IF AND WHEN it actually works. False door open signals, paper jams, cartridge jams, misfeeds, and I only use it as my last resort printer. Hate it."
2,HP Officejet 6310 not recommended,The printer's fax and scanner never worked. Software errors when trying to make these functions work. Unable to get the right software from HP website that would eliminate problems. Waste of time and money.
3,Slow printing,Old HP print speed double; 6300 series akin to watching paint dry...loads with no more then 20 sheets of paper.
3,Sure Wish The Scanner Worked,"Fairly good product. Getting it to Bluetooth with my computer was a bit more complex. It had to be completed manually using the printer's ""address number.""Having no luck getting the ""all in one"" to be an ""all in one""...I have not had any luck what-so-ever, getting the machine to SCAN!also, it NEEDS a dust cover! [should be included]."
2,"Poor scanning, limited lifespan","Home use and my needs are very simple but this printer broke in less than two years. 'Reset Power' msg with all lights flashing and unplugging, etc. doesn't help. HP guidance is 'printer needs servicing'. Naturally, servicing costs more than new printer with cartridges. HP has always had bloated and poor SW and this is no different. Scanning works poorly, scanned documents never looked like originals, margins are off and text often enlarged. Couldn't use for a professional document. However, lots of formats supported. Software always wants to run in background and is not particularly user-friendly. HP has always felt that printing is the prime function of your computer and inserts itself a lot. Cartridge life is not impressive given my very low usage. My other printers are/have been Canon and Brother and the Canon is far superior to the other two."
2,"Great features, but not sturdy or reliable","I've owned a number of HP printers, and I've loved every one but this one. The biggest problem is constant carriage jams (usually easily fixed by pushing the OK button), and fairly frequent paper jams. The top of the machine is poorly aligned, and I have to fiddle with it to close it every time I open it to deal with those carriage and paper jams. When it prints, the printing is of good quality.Printing envelopes is a real hassle, and the envelopes jam frequently - my old HP printer did envelopes like a charm. The scanner and fax functions work well, and it's nice to have a network connection for this all-in-one.I have the impression the newer HP printers are made much more cheaply than the old ones were, because I'm starting to have problems with newer HP printers at work.I own HP stock and I hate to say this, but the most recent printers I've bought have been from Canon.-Joe-"
5,Incredible Value!,"I love this printer. I am not a whiz with computers, but this was so easy to set up and start using. For the price, the quality is amazing. The size is perfect for home. Considering all it does, it is very compact. The only thing I would change is the printer output tray. It could be a little sturdier."
5,Completely Satisfied,"Ive had my AIO for a month now and I am completely satisfied. Set up was very easy and its worked well. As yet I have not used the document feeder but everything else has worked well and I have not used up the ink yet.One curious thing, using the copier function produced very dark copies. I called HP tech support and the advice, strange as it sounds was, to plug the device directly to the wall and not to a surge protector. That made all the difference. On fast/economical settings it can spit out copies at amazing speeds. Ive been very pleased, and also perplexed about some of the negative reviews. This is a great printer etc."
4,Good Product,"I really like this all in one product. Setup was very easy. All the functions work with no problems. I have not tried the photo printing function yet but I expect to have no problems. The printing/scanning speed is not very fast, so if you need speed, look for another product. My only complaint is the size of the print cartriges. They are very small and expensive."
3,All Right for the Money,"Bought this printer about 2 1/2 years ago. Just replaced it today with a Canon Pixma MX850. I loved this printer for the time that I had it. But the last 6 months, it kept screwing up my printing as far as the quality. It kept shadowing my print on the paper. I couldn't explain it. And the people I talked to didn't know how to fix it either. So it lasted a couple of years and did a great job. But for me, I like to buy quality products I don't have to replace over and over again. Perhaps, I was just unlucky and this won't happen to everyone. But I'm not so apt to purchase this model again. So far I'm in love with my new Canon."
5,Great Printer - Great Value !,This is just a great printer. A huge improvement over my three year old HP printer and no larger. I was so happy with it that I bought a second one for my daughter. I can recommend it without reservation !
4,Consistent performer,"This is not a top-of-the-line photo printer and the scanner cover won't stand up to serious abuse, but this printer model has repeatedly done a good job with printing, scanning, faxing, etc through a number of purchases I've done for/with friends. Its hard to beat the price for a decent workhorse printer that doesn't drink ink."
1,You GET what you PAY for...(why can't I remember THAT?),"I got this printer for about a hundred bucks...shipped fast, installed like a dream....it also has held up pretty well as I have have beaten it repeatedly out of frustration. paper jams CONSTANTLY....and forget envelopes....it's a crappy piece of plastic...what did I expect for $100??? a real machine?....maybe next time."
2,JUNK,I purchased this printer 4 weeks ago and have not been able to use it. I use Vista Home Premiun but the softwere is not compatable with Vista and I get an error statement that says Fatal Error every time I try to load it. Amizon tells me to contact HP. ( Not their problem and will not accept a return.) I did this but HP does not seem to know how to fix it. Most HELP agents do not have knowledge of this product. DO NOT purchase this product if you use Vista. Do not purchase anything from Amizon if you intend to use it. No returns if opened. How do you know if it doesn't work if you don't open it...... ?
4,Just like the big guys!,I was really happy to have chosen this unit. It does everything & it does it well. Couldn't ask for more. The only thing I would have liked to have included was wireless.
4,fast and easy,"Even though I usually read instruction manuals, this machine is so self expanitory that you hardly have to. Good quality, fast speed, great price. No complaints."
2,HP Support is BAD//This printer won't work with my msworks!,"When I went to use this printer with MS Works, it shut down that application with the message ""out of memory."" So, I tried HP chat...took her about 30 minutes to warm up to trying anything. So, she is so slow (I mean minutes between sentences), after about forty minutes, I called HP while I'm waiting on chat. They first try to tell me it's a Microsoft problem. I say no. The only problem is that your printer doesn't work w/Works. (Works prints with other printers.) I told her what the error message was. She forgot. Meanwhile, I'm almost an hour and a half on chat w/NO results. This printer does not work w/MS WORKS! And - HP tech assistance is DEPLORABLE. Truly. Bad."
4,Hard to start on the latest MAC,"I have the latest MAC. Great PC. HOwever I had problems with the installation of the HP all-in-one. I called HP tech support and got a guy named Brian in Canada. If he is an example of HP's tech support they ROCK!!!!! Brian was great!!!! Not only did he get it working he got it to be wireless when this item is not intended to be wireless. I can't begin to praise the tech support and especially Brian enough. I am very, very happy with my purchase."
2,A Boat Anchor,"had a 6210 that worked great for 1 1/2 years and then died. luckily had extended warranty so exchanged for this 6310. i have been fighting this for 3 days now and swapped out the new unit for another new unit. installed over and over but can't get scan to work. print function works fine, even when computer says unit is disconnected but it is hooked up and turned on. scan just will not work and get error message that no connection to unit, even though print works and all usb drivers installed. hp trouble line no help, just uninstall and reinstall over and over and over, etc, etc. something missing, but who knows what."
3,"Nice product, bad software & support","I have been using my Officejet for about 3 months now. I have it installed directly to my home network. From the beginning there have been software problems resulting in various error messages on all 4 PCs on the network. A small nusiance. On one PC I am not able to scan, but all the others work fine. Online tech support has been no help after 15+ hours. As far as the quality of the machine, it prints, copies, faxes, and scans (except for the one PC) very nicely for the price range that it is in. In conclusion, I am an advanced PC user, and with all my expertise I am still having problems getting the software just right. I'm sure it's a networking problem and I would bet anyone installing it directly to a PC would have no problems. Otherwise, good luck."
1,Good Idea--bad piece of technology,"I purchased my first one in March, 2007. The printer would ""lose"" networked computers, the speed dials in the fax module couldn't be accessed from our computers, then it would freeze up. Couldn't simply turn off the printer--it had to be unplugged, then we had to set up again. After multiple software reinstallation and 4th level uninstalls, tech support finally said that there was something wrong with the machine and they would replace it. In May, 2007 we installed the new one, this one was good at keeping the networked computers on; the speed dial accessibilty was lost after a month (could only input from the printer); the print quality was very poor. Some colors would not print, then when they did print, it would be with streaks."
2,The Grinder,"I purchased this printer in July, 2006. It functioned well, easy to install, although a hog on memory and a hog on ink. Fax easy to send and document feeder worked without problem. Then it started a grinding noise each time the carriage went across. It is still working, grinding its way back and forth. A friend owns the same printer and he said that his also started grinding and then it just froze up. He bought another printer.I contacted HP and they offer replacement with like unit for $99 and a warranty of 90 days. The inital cost of $170 with only 10 months of satisfactory service makes me wonder if another $99 is a good deal. I used to think HP's were good as long as the drivers worked well with the computer platforms, and were reasonable in terms of ink use.It really seems that the manufacturers are making cheap machines and making their profit on ink. I'd pay more for a machine that was made better and was ink friendly."
4,Great printer,"This was remarkably inexpensive for all it can do. It was easy to set up on a Linux system; just plug it in and turn it on. The installation instructions look harder on Mac or MS-Windows, but I haven't tried them. It was especially easy to set up as a network printer; just plug it directly into the router, and it's ready to go for any operating system.Print quality is as good as can be expected from an inkjet printer. Color quality is excellent. I haven't tried photo printing, so I cannot comment.For a small printer, this machine has proven exceptionally reliable. I have far fewer jams and misfeeds with this than I have with any other home or small office printer. In fact, I cannot recall a single paper jam in the time I've owned it.As with all inkjets, ink is expensive, and cartridges do not last long. I seem to get better ink conservation out of this than out of other injket printers I have owned, though.The scanner works reliably as expected, and the document feeder works great."
2,Not All That Pleased,"I purchased this printer two years ago. I haven't been all that pleased with it since unpacking it. Overall it only does just ok... I am now shopping for a new printer because it keeps telling me 'papper jam' and there is no paper jam. It prints only 'just ok' pictures, I use my printers a lot for crafts (cards and etc.) and this requires a little thicker paper and this printer won't feed this card paper. I've never had this problems with other printers before.Documents come out fine, but again it won't print now because of this 'ghost paper jam'."
1,DON'T BUY IT! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Shortly after the warranty expired the printer quit working.It showed error message about ""paper jam"" and there was not a paper jam. I contacted HP on the phone twice and once online. It would not reset and HP would not replace it. There is no fix for this problem. I found customer service at HP to be the worse I have ever dealt with. They would only offer a refurb at a price which was higher than I could buy a new one at most stores. This will be the last HP product for me. I also had a HP CD writer that did not work. I hate HP products! I replaced the HP printer with a Canon MP530 for half the price of the HP and it works perfectly."
3,"Good, but not what I expect from HP","This all-in-one does all its functions reasonably well. The print quality is very clear. I would agree with the reviews that say it is slow. Not a big issue for me, but I have noticed that. I would also agree that the quality of construction has seemed to slip at HP since my 895cxi was built. My biggest beef is that it will not do envelopes - at all! To my knowledge there is no high capacity ink cartridge available and it seems to run out of ink quickly. The document feeder is strictly for the FAX. The software was also difficult to load and took three attempts. My PC locked up for inexplicable reasons. I chalked this up to typical Dell problems until I read other reviews. Overall it does its job, but this unit has made me a little less confident in HP printers. Does anyone know of a HP all-in-one that handles envelopes well?"
1,Not worth it at any price,"Worked well for two weeks. Yes the software uses tons of disk space. Now after 2 weeks the paper handling is impossible. Every page ruined. Apparently one of the pick up wheels is inoperative or slow. I have been unable to fix this. HP support not any help, a waste of time, all one gets is frustration.I put this one back in the box and bought a MX310 at Fry's with a 2 year full replacement warranty. Total price taxes and all was not much more than the $99 on Amazon. I loved earlier HP's but once burned is a warning to me. It looks like Canon is my new brand. Not as many freatures as the HP for the price, but it works great."
5,Gelb is great!,"This book, which I'm told is now out of print, is probably one of the more influential works on leadership that I've read. It's not the standard read, but Gelb has a lot more fun as he intertwines the analogy of juggling with quotes, poetry and his themes (like letting your work play, and embracing your mistakes). This book was recommended to me by one of the best motivators in DI sports (his entire team reads it) and it quickly became one of my favorites."
4,la amante perfecta,"la historia esta muy bien .me gusto mucho . en mi opinion la autora alargo mucho la historia le quita un poco de interes al lector.si van a comprar el libro les sugiero que compren una edicion mas reciente esta es una de las primeras que salio.el libro es muy apasionado .simon quiere conquistar a portia y decide cortejarla .siendo de caracter tan voluntarioso y queriendo siempre hacer las cosas a su manera decide ganarsela primero convertirla en su amante para que luego ella decida ser su esposa .se ven implicados en un asesinato con la vida de portia siendo amenazada.el suspenso de tu no saber quien es el asesino hasta lo ultimo del libro .la historia es muy linda ,los encuentros entre ellos como poco a poco va surgiendo el amor a pesar que se conocen de toda la vida.lo recomiendo la historia es muy buena a pesar de todo."
1,Puzzled,"Never ordered this item, not in my records!! Never ordered this item, not in my records!! Never ordered this item, not in my records!! Never ordered this item, not in my records!! Never ordered this item, not in my records!!"
3,actually not phenomenally stupid,"""Genesis"" is nowhere near as phenomenally stupid as the synopsis makes it sound. The basic premise is, yes, pretty darned stupid, but if one suspends one's disbelief (and if one cannot do that, why is one watching Star Trek?), there are some fun chills here.Gates McFadden didn't have much to work with, but she created a fine eerie atmosphere. This one ends up being fun to watch (Troi scarfing down a big plate of caviar, Worf calvinistically suggesting it's too rich) -- and at least it's not preachy."
1,very disapppointed,"I'm afraid this is one of my least favorite episodes. The direction and filming were indeed good, but the science behind the episode was completely bogus. (I know a lot of medical people, including geneticists...they hate this ep.) Worse, and perhaps because she directed it, Gates' character,the doctor responsible for the trouble, showed absolutely NO sign of any remorse or regret for her actions...actions which caused a number of murder deaths among the crew. The only redeeming quality was the as usual high quality work of Dwight Schultz, as the neurotic and entertaining Barclay.ST:TNG has often had trouble with its main characters being wooden or unemotional, or with weak science, but this one I just couldn't forgive. Sorry."
5,total Beach Boys meets The Ramones good fun!,"The Beatnik Termites have a definite retro sound to them, reminiscent of the Beach Boys, while maintaining a 90's edge. The songs on this CD are all very catchy, and will no doubt have you singing along. Plenty of harmonies, and hand-claps throughout this entire CD. Song topics are also fun and harmless. Songs about the beach and girls comprise the majority of this CD. I highly recommend this CD to everyone... lots of fun and hooks galore!"
5,Great Product,I have a night stand that I use to make various craft projects. I bought this and it allowed me to short out all my crafy supplies. I RECOMMEND IT. It arrived quickly and was as described.
2,"""UNHAPPY""","I WAS VERY EMPRESS WITH THE ALBUM AS SUCH UNTILL I STARTED TO PUT THE PICTURES IN AND THE BINDING FELL APART. WAS GOING TO ORDER A SECOND ONE. BUT NOT NOW. K. LANE P.S. I AM GOING TO ORDER ONE MORE, HOPEFULLY THE NEXT ONE WON'T FALL A PART AND I CAN GIVE A 5 STAR RATING."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I searched for a 5 x 7 photo album to hold my daughters senior pictures. It gave me this product along with the description that the pictures could be inserted vertically or horazontial. When received, the album only holds 4 x 6 pictures vertically."
3,Well-made but sizing wrong,"These albums appear to be well-made and durable, but they do not measure 9 x 9. They measure 9 inches deep, but stand between 9.5 and 10 inches tall. This may be a minor point, but I've been using 9x9 albums for my children for 10 years, and I prefer to have albums of a uniform height on the shelf. The dimensions should be accurate to save customers who want actual 9x9 albums the trouble of shipping them back."
3,Photo Freak,I have a million pictures and I ordered this photo book in the black and red. They are nice but they fill up fast. They are nice if you need a full book for a few occasions. The fabric on them are alright. Kind of cheap looking.
1,Very Low Quality,Thought it was going to be nice but was not. Bad cheap paper inside. Cheap covers. Avoid and spend the money for a nice album.
2,Worked well for allergies but stopped working,"This air purifier worked great for a little over a year until one day it just wouldn't start! The controls made it easy to start an hour before I got home, or an hour after I'd fall asleep, but after a year it would not work in any outlet (in two apartments) UNLESS I had it plugged into my UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) and the UPS was unplugged from the wall and running on it's batteries! I'm not kidding. This was true in 2 apartments; two UPS units... Other than that, great!"
3,Not a Nice set for the money I spent......,"Looking very nice but not a good quality item. After couple wash the edages torn. Beaware, it is 100% polyaster."
4,Pattie of Atlanta,"After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical as to what I would receive, but was pleasantly surprised. The colors were bright and pretty. The throw pillows were perfect... I've paid $10-20 for a single matching pillow at Linens & Things, when I got this whole set for under $30 with free shipping--you can't beat that deal! The gold trim added the extra touch. The fabric is a bit shiny, similar to hotel bedspreds, which tend to last longer and not fade. The fabric is thin, however, and may rip under a lot of stress, but should be fine if it is treated gently. I think this set is perfect for a guest bed that is not used very often. I didn't like the bottom edge of the bedskirt. It was surged and you could see the threads on the bottom. I will hem the skirt before I put it on the bed, but I certainly got my money's worth!"
2,Product not as described,Some pieces of this product needs to be dry cleaned only and that could make a huge difference. Material looks like use and throw stuff.
3,Pretty colors but not as described,"Colors are true to picture. Braiding on edge is nice and pillows are cute. HOWEVER the tags on comforter and bed skirt clearly say ""DRY CLEAN ONLY"" while the description says ""machine washable, tumble dry."" This makes a huge difference to me, but for what I paid it isn't worth paying to mail it back and for re-stocking fee. Fabic has no cotton listed--I think Manufacturer changed materials. So, I like its appearance but will replace it when it needs to be cleaned."
3,Looks Nice,All this does is look nice on the bed. It is great for the Spring because it is light weight. I do not advise that you put this in the dryer in fear that it will fall apart. line dry is the best way to take care of it. Overall you get what you pay for.
4,Washed up great!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have already washed the set three times since I got it because I have pets and kids and it has always come out very nice. Just because it says dry clean only does not mean you have too do it that way. And I also used a gentle soap in my wash.
2,comforter set is not comfort,I brought this comforter set by looking at the excellent picture. but it is not comfort as you can see in picture because it was made with silk cloth and always moves around....
4,"Please, Ben, go back...","This is a very good guide, as far as it goes, but unfortunately, that's often not nearly far enough. Much of the information is badly outdated (most of the campsites described in some areas no longer exist, for example). I've been waiting several years to get an updated edition, because we've used ours so much, it's fallen apart. Now that it's completely disintegrated, into a dozen or more pieces, I gave up and ordered another copy of the same old edition; but if you come out with a new edition, with better information, I'd get that, right away, even now."
4,son loves bugs and loves this toy,"11 yr old loves bugs and enjoys this toy. One warning..son left on in room for hours and it was really hot...probably could've started a fire. Since then, I keep it in a cabinet and he has to ask to use it and return it when he's finished. Otherwise fun toy."
4,"Fun, fun!","My boys have a blast with this toy. They always want to make bugs. We did have an issue with the door sticking, but my husband rigged it so it would work again. This is a great toy for little boys who love bugs!"
1,crap,"i bought this toy for my 6 year old for christmas. it lasted for 2 days. the liquid stuff got everywhere. all inside the cooker, all on everything. and the bugs that you make are fun to play with for about 2 minutes. and it would not work shortly after that... what a junk toy :("
2,MISSING PARTS!,"I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON IN LOUSIANNA, I LIVE OVER 500 MILES AWAY. WHEN HE GOT THE TOY HE NOTICED THAT IT WAS MISSING PARTS,HE WAS SO DISAPOINTED THAT HE DIDNT EVEN WANT TO ASK FOR A REFUND. THANKS AMAZON................."
1,Garbage Waste of money,If you want to spend a lot of money on a piece of junk that doesn't even come with a light bulb then this product is for you. Any good reviews were written by the company posing to be paying costumers if you can't tell already. Stay clear off all jakks pacific products they are trash.
1,Don't Buy This Terrible Toy,This is one of the worst toys I have ever ordered. I ordered this because I had Creepy Crawlers as a child. It is not like Creepy Crawlers was in that it is made very poorly. My husband and I spent hours trying to get it to work but it never worked. We realized it is not really made to work well or in our case at all. There is no customer service for this company. I can see why. This is a complete waste of money and I do not think Amazon should not even sell it. I had to throw it out. Of course it was very frustrating for the children when it did not work after hours of trying and attempts to try to find out how to get in touch with customer service.
3,They don't make toys like they used to,"I agree with two customers ratings. First the ""special"" light bulb is not included most people don't have chandeleirs in their house any more. Second, the confusion with the Goop FX was wicked, We thought it was some kind of accelerant or something. My brother had one of these growing up and it seemed so much easier to make several at one time! Any way the ""one"" bug we have made so far did come out pretty cool!"
1,Broke after one use,"We successfully made one tray of bugs, then part of the oven ""door"" broke....the part that engages the oven to work! I found the piece, and planned to take the oven apart to superglue the piece back on, only to discover that what looked like flat-head screws were metal pieces that couldn't be removed whatsoever. So, I tried jury rigging it to get it to stay in the ""on"" position so we could turn it on by just plugging it in. Well, that wouldn't work because the oven door, which wouldn't engage the lever, controls the ability to slide the on/off switch. I wish they had made the part of the door that engages the toy to work from metal rather than cheap plastic that any kid (including mine) can break by being too forceful. Bad engineering and low quality materials."
4,better than the new ones that enclose goo for exploding >.<,"better than the new ones that have exploding goo cause those just sound messy and the reviews are bad, not much else to say cause this stupid review makes me write a ton of words but ....older is better!"
4,Worked perfectly - love it!,"My 6 year old wanted this ""above all else"" :) for Christmas - depsite a few mixed reviews - it worked perfectly, exactly as we expected - and he loves it!"
4,Fun,"I gave this to my nephew for Christmas and he really enjoyed playing with it. The only problem was he became impatient waiting for the mold to cool off, so he could open the machine. I however, thought this was a great safety feature especially for anxious little boys."
3,Don't Buy this to Learn to Play,"We bought this hoping that it would help the kids learn to play the guitar (at least learn some chords). They lost interest very quickly b/c it was a little too advanced for newcomers.The guitar works great, just not great for learning the guitar."
3,I had more fun with it than my kids had,"I agree with the reviews that say that the fun factor just isn't as great with this as other offerings ... and although we got this one because it seemed better suited to teach how to play a guitar, how are they going to learn if it's too challenging? Maybe if you work with them through the lessons, and once they get good enough graduate to a real guitar. This is not really a teach yourself to play instrument, and in fact I don't think such a thing exists for kids when it comes to teaching guitar. If there is please let me know. And no, I don't think video game guitars qualify. This came close ... it was just too hard for those little fingers, and not quite engaging enough."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","I was first interested in this book after hearing the author speak about it on NPR. It took me several years to get around to reading it. The idea is great! I love that he took old letter and added his own research to fleash out the details. It offers an interesting look at love, sex, marriage and social standards in the mid-1750s, as well as a look at a global elite. This said, I do feel the book falls short of what it could have been. It seems to just end. And, I think the author would have done better to make it a highly accurate historical novel. This would have allowed him to draw a better picture of the story rather than simply presenting the ""facts"" of what happened. Interesting, but not sure its worth the read."
4,This is nonfiction...,"Definately be aware that this is nonfiction when you read this novel. It is intriguing because it is a real story, there are real happenings in this novel, however, the story is a bit duller than the ficitioius acounts we (or should I say, I usually read) involving this subject matter. I'm an avid reader, but my reading isn't very scholarly, where to me, this came off as more of a research book. This is definately a biography, although it reads as a novel, don't be disapointed in the end. I did get very attached to the character of Guistiniana (HOW DO YOU SAY THAT NAME?!) and it was interesting watching her personality grow over time.To sum it up: I enjoyed this novel, however be aware that it IS nonfiction therefore it doesn't have the *BANG* at the end we're used to"
2,Wanted: Novelist skilled at describing clandestine love affairs,"I don't think this is a very good book. The time period (18th century Venice) is interesting. The topic (two lovers unable to marry because of a difference in social position)is interesting, as are the circumstances (the book is constructed around letters discovered many years later by the author's father). The letters themselves, however, become increasingly dull and repetitious; eventually, I began to skim them and then skip them altogether. The author's prose is weighed down by such extraneous detail, such tiresome step by step accountings of clandestine meetings and so on, that I began to regret that these letters had not fallen into the hands of a novelist. Henry James, to be exact."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I think I got through about 20 percent. Why couldn't I finish it? Maybe it was too real. Maybe too hopeless. Maybe lengthy conversations about love are just too boring. The characters annoyed me. She became increasingly insecure, constantly seeking reassurance, when she was separated from her lover. She whines, she pouts, she makes accusations. Although, if I were in her situation, almost a prisoner, as well-chaperoned women were at that time, I would have been just as miserable and passive, since women had few alternatives then. These lovers loose a chance to be together long-term, because they don't have enough self-control and discretion. It's possible that the book gets better later on; I just couldn't stand it any longer."
2,Think biography not novel.,"I had very high expectations for this book based on the reviews, my love for this time in history and Venice. I expected it to read more like a novel and it was not. What is was for me was dry and whiney. I finished the book, but considered putting it down several times. I kept thinking there was something redeeming coming, to justify the reviews, but I was left wanting. For me the most remarkable part of the book, was the story of finding the letters on which the book was based. If there was one more page with the main character whining about I love you but can't have you, I might have started to physically gag."
2,Not much to recommend it.,"I am at a loss as to the reason for the glowing reviews for this book. There is nothing even remotely admirable about either of the two protagonists. They are shallow, vain, lazy and conniving. They go to great and elaborate lengths to try to cuckold old men as a means to secure their love yet lack the courage of their convictions to just simply be together. Their apparent casual faithlessness also makes their written declarations of undying love ring hollow. I gave the book 2 stars only because of the historical content. If this is a true reflection of Venetian society, it's no wonder the Republic fell into such a decline."
1,who cares?,"i've read hundreds if books in 59 years and this is the most vacuous and uninteresting of them all. the theme, if you can call it that, is redundantly force fed until you just don't know if you can keep any more down. the best part is the end."
5,So real you can smell the streets of 18th Century Venice!,Wow! It's rare to find a book so exquisite and enticing that you read it very slowly because you don't want the experience to end! The Venetian Affair is such a book. Unbelievably researched and beautifully written this work transports you to the grand cities of 18th Century Europe. More than a love story it's the detailed life of two extraordinary human beings and the culture and times in which they lived. It's a unique and slightly voyeuristic experience to read their thoughts and elegantly written letters in the 21st Century. My compliments to the author who did an incredible job of bringing this story to life. I loved this book!
5,Not a romance novel - this is the real thing. Step into the time machine.,"An astonishing book, a fascinating glimpse into 18th century Venice, its politics and its people. Readers expecting a bodice-ripping fantasy might be disappointed. Yes, the letters are repetitive, and their tone is not of that of the 21st century, but that's because these are real letters, written by real human beings, and we are reading about their actions and feelings in their own time. These candid historic accounts provide insight into a society that can be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Step out of the box and enter the time machine. This book transported me."
5,The best book on eBay so far!!!,I've read many books on eBay. This book has more useful advice than all the rest combined. The excellent research is evident throughout this easy-to-ready volume. This is not one of those books promising instant wealth from eBay. It is a practical how-to guide that covers all aspects of selling on Ebay. This book is valuable to eBay beginners and experienced eBay sellers alike. This is my first review. The excellence and utility of this book motivated me to take the time to share my thoughts on why all eBayers should own a copy.
3,Decent and honest book,"I found this book to be informative. The reading is easy and well done. I just don't know if I could fully engage an ebay business with this book. I will say this though, it was worth the money, and I'm glad I bought it. It definitely is an asset to learning on ebay. - Kevin S. Torrance CA"
3,Not as good as expected.,Not the in depth information that I thought it would be. Some useful information but I was expecting more. Get it used and it would be worth the money.
2,Only for advanced ebay buyers/sellers,Don't buy this book unless you already have extensive ebay experience.Hard to understand. Puts me to sleep quickly.
1,Ok book with out of date links,This is a good book for beginners but dont count on finding supplier infomation or outside resources. Most all of the links and web site referred to are out of date and are either out of business or dont have valid links.
1,No secrets revealed,"I learned nothing new from this book. Very dissappointing. Save your money and pass on this book, just read the ebay guides and tutorials."
5,eBay Powerseller Secrets: Insider Tips,"This book is well written, easy to read and understand. It's informative, giving tips to improve product research, listings and sales. It also shows how to take advantage of all the resources that eBay provides. I have begun to employ some of the advice and I am seeing results. I am very pleased with the book."
4,contains many excellant recommendations,Discusses issues & available services a novice would have spent a lot of trial & errors to learn
3,No Battery Included [wtf],"It's a pretty cool camera. It still suffers from the shutter-button-pressed-delay problem, but it seems to be the norm with the new auto focus point and shoots.The Main Gripe: I ordered Two of these cameras for christmas presents. I also gave the recipients film. GUESS WHAT! The damn camera does not include the battery. Not that the battery is hard to find, but needless to say, nobody shot any pictures the day they got the camera."
1,Already on my 3rd of this camera...,"This camera has wasted several of my rolls of film!! It will start rewinding in the middle of the roll all by itself. I took my first one back, they gave me a new one, needless to say it didn't work either. Good thing my husband bought the replacement plan or I would be stuck with this P.O.S."
2,Not happy with Olympus,"I hate this camera, primarily due to the useless customer support and owner's manual. The instruction manual contains 5 languages PER PAGE and has NO troubleshooting guide, among its many flaws. Customer support is pleasant enough without really doing a single thing to be helpful. The first camera I had took fuzzy pictures for inexplicable reasons, so it was exchanged for another one (same model), and this one is now not operating properly. Customer service guided me through troubleshooting my problem by telling me I must not have film loaded when I knew I did, then had me open the case, exposing the film of which I was in mid-roll. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I will never buy another Olympus product."
4,Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 170 QD film camera,"I own and use this camera. I have shot about two dozen rolls of Kodak 400 ASA colour film with it, and the pictures I got were simply excellent every time. Not a single shot was sub par!This camera is good value for the money.I believe the gripes that some users have about this camera may be due to any or any combination of the following reasons:-Not having bothered to1. lock the focus by pressing the shutter half-way down momentarily, and then pressing it fully down to take the picture;2. ensure the camera is held very firmly/steadily or placed securely on a tripod to eliminate CAMERA SHAKE (or hand(s) shake);3. ensure the film used was fresh and/or have not been subjected to X'ray scanning at airports;4. read the manual carefully.What I don't like about this camera is the noticeable shutter lag which occurs occasionally when it is used indoors and also its rather fragile build. Ah, but then I did not pay megabucks for this camera."
3,Long zoom lens produces blurry pictures,"I bought this camera mainly because I thought the 170mm zoom lens would prevent me from turning out as a dot lost in the crowd in my college graduation photos. Well, I'm not a dot, but I'm one huge blur. To fully take advantage of this long zoom lens, you must have extremely steady hands or a tripod. It's not a problem when the lens isn't zoomed out all the way, but then I might as well own a cheaper camera with a shorter zoom. I will probably try to sell this camera and downgrade to an Olympus with a 140mm or 110 mm zoom lens."
4,Olympus Pocket Cameras,"I'm contemplating this camera to replace another similar model I left behind on the airplane. If it is like the other units, the only knocks are the battery compartment door will need duct tape to stay closed eventually and the finder is somewhat small. This makes it a little hard to get a quick eye-to-finder alignment for fast ""did you see that fish jump"" type shots.This will be the third unit, previous units only failed due to extroardianary circumstances that I would in no way hold Olympus responsible for. I take these cameras out hunting & fishing, since it's ""splashproof."" Small enough to fit in a pocket, light enough that it does not to feel like you are carrying around a brick all day at a theme park and always takes great pix!"
1,let me down!,I've owned my camera for just over one year...the pictures were great...for about 9 months then the camera started to rewind in the middle of a roll of film...sometimes. I sent it back to Olympus during the warranty period and they returned it but it continued to rewind...I'm giving up and presently using disposables...
5,Wonderful!,"Despite the title, involving 'lesbian erotica', this book is not just porn, as you may think. The short stories are very involved and wonderfully thought out- some don't have any sex at all, just a short plot that sets a characterization. Of course, when there *is* sex (which, honestly, happens very often), it's very well-written and hot... just what you'd expect a 'best of the best' to be. If you're looking for this sort of book, I'd definitely reccommend this over any others."
3,proud to be female,I found to many male role plays or even ambiguous none sex characters for my taste. Some of the stores were okay is why am giving 3 stars. On the whole I would not buy this ebook again. Being female I find nothing wrong with being feminine and maybe this book was just not to my taste.
1,Anex,new kindle user. bought this by mistake when i was getting a sample of Georgia Beers book. Since i had to pay for it i started to read it and thought it was junk. Buy Georgia Beers books they are worth it.
2,Great production values but the singing might annoy...,"Let's be honest - Sonny Southon is not a great vocalist. Maybe if she stuck into her halfway decent mid-range she would be pleasant to listen to, but the problem here is that she constantly strains that range and the tone and oscillation she hits can distract mightily from the songs. Having said that, this album is largely produced/arranged by the brilliant Jeff Lorber and that makes a number of the tracks sparkle beyond expectation. Throw in a couple of cameo backing vocals from the likes of Eric Benet and this album has its moments...enough to recommend if you're a Lorber or Benet fan anyway!"
2,Not very good,"Use: Computer interfaceExperience: 15 years of piano, Music Tech MajorIt's very easy to use. Plug and play interface.Cons-If you are a fast piano player. It wont keep up with your player-Extreme amount of latency-Sustains notes even though I am not sustaining them.-Does weird things with my notes. It will crush notes together even though I played them separately.I bought it cause its cheap. If you want good equipment, then buy expensive stuff. You get what you pay for. I made a mistake. As a music major, I would never get this or recommend it to my friends.Do yourself a favor. Buy an m-box (not a fan of those though), or presonas. Spend a little bit more cash, and get something good."
3,"works fine here (unlike review above, got no 'warning msg')",but consider a new usb-midi/audio interface like Tascam us122 for 2x the price if u need audio.
5,Awesome,This thing is awesome. Really well built. I'm using it for an accessory fuse panel for aftermarket stuff I've installed in my truck. I highly recommend this product. I'll be buying Blue Sea stuff for future projects for sure.
3,What's the cover for???,"Good quality fuse block. I'm not sure what the cover is for. It is open on all 4 sides. Dust, dirt, water and everything will find their way into this thing."
1,dont buy from this guys,"never send, never contacted, and customer service........crap. even more on an order before they nener answered and i lost 60.00..............this is not a trustable company. and no care is taken. my opinion is short buy honest."
4,Suprisingly Tight Glam-Pop,"Surprisingly enough, one of my favorite albums of 2004. I'd always viewed Elf Power as strictly second-tier among the ranks of the neo-pop-psychedelia bands under the Elephant 6 collective umbrella. They lacked the sheer pop chops of Apples in Stereo, the psychedelic craftsmanship of Olivia Tremor Control, and the lyrical intensity of Neutral Milk Hotel. But with most of those bands long gone, Elf Power rises to the occasion with a straightforward glam-infused rock album. Gone are the twisted, fantasy-infused story-songs of recent releases, and the lo-fi sonic meanderings. This stuff is straight-out catchy with no apologies. The title track is one of those riff-driven pop songs you can play 5 times straight and just keep going, and a few other songs come close. Any indie pop album that offers 4-5 tracks worthy of inclusion on your next upbeat mix tape is way ahead of the pack."
5,Fantastic psychedelic pop rock! Most people will LOVE this!,"Elf Power deserves to be big. They make such great psychedelic/post-rock influenced indie rock you have to wonder why they aren't widely recognized. This album in particular is great, although compared to its predecessors ""Creatures"" and ""A Dream In Sound"" you can tell its not AS good (though I think ""The Stranger"" is one of their best songs). Once again Andrew Rieger's voice is very soothing, even if he DOES go for a harder-edged sound this time around. Lyrically it's not really a concept album like the ""Creatures"" and ""A Dream In Sound""; they're once again very memorable and catchy lyrics that make singing along pretty easy to do. It is, however, teeming with very catchy songs that contain occasionally great lyrics. It's one of their ""worst"" albums but still manages to be leagues ahead of other bands, and with every song here being great it's easy to see why it deserves a ""5"". Absolutely recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"
3,Nothing new from the elves,"In Elf Power's sixth full length, we witness the group return to their straight pop punk songs like in the days of ""When the Red King Comes,"" which unfortunately is my least favorite of their efforts. This album doesn't have the humor of their debut or the dreamy innovations experimented with on ""Winter is Coming."" The album, however, is a fun listen, but for me it's more background music while cleaning my room."
3,It tells you where to draw instead of how to draw!,"The book doesn't have any exercise materials to practice on, it mostly talks about tips instead of technics. It has plently of pictures on the back which would have been nice, if they draw all of it in steps and show me how."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"If you are thinking of getting this game i seriously warn against it. Sure here i was just as you are excited because hey, mega man rocks and so do rpgs right?? WRONG mega man in this RPG is SOOOOO BORING. X(mega man) has 4 attacks in all which pretty much do not change through the whole game, as they are overall... the same moves. You have main buster, 2 sub weapons (very in effect and damage) and a shot that hits all enemies on the screen. That is mostly the whole game right there. Also it is short topping out at around 20-25 hours. I suggest you save your money and go buy something else. Unless you are an intense hardcore megaman fan buy this (i thought i was till i bought it). The battles are random encounters and a turned based in a very slow way that do not speed up at all."
4,Please Help Me !!!! (Don't Meen to be helpful),[...] When you are in battles are the fights somewhat like final fantasy or like Street Fighters? It would really help me I'm wondering whether or not to get this or Megaman & Bass.Please Help
3,good game,shipment was fast I got exactly what I paid for and more the game comes with a rock man card with his stats that's pretty cool
1,Rip off.,"I am in full agreement with the previous reviewer. Spend your money on Shades of Gray by Billy Barber - the composer of most of these tunes. How this chick could have the audacity to claim these as her ""original"" pieces is beyond me - and I have few scruples. I only gave it one star because Amazon forced me."
1,Levine's new CD a direct copy of Shades of Gray by B. Barber,"I have only heard one piece from Ms. Levine's new ""original"" CD. My first reaction when I heard it on the radio was, ""Gosh, I haven't heard this tune, ""Beth"" since 1983 when Billy Barber wrote and played it for his CD. Then I heard the announcer say it was an ""original"" work performed and written by Caren Levine. If anyone wants to compare the two, please pick up a Billy Barber CD called, ""Shades of Gray"". Coincidently, there is also a tune on it also called ""Flowers from a Secret Admirer."" The piece I heard from her CD was called Carrot Flavored Kool-Aid. This piece was called Beth on the Billy Barber CD."
5,holy smokes,"Just finished the book, and it's pretty hard to put into words what I feel. If I were Japanese, I would be ashamed, humiliated, and very concerned that my culture could/?can reach the depths of depravity that Dr. Bumgarner so matter-of-factly describes. The treatment of their POWs is almost beyond belief, as is the fact that any of the prisoners survived at all. The book is well-written and engrossing, with a physician's eye for detail. No exaggeration nor hyperbole creeps in -- none are needed -- the story speaks for itself. You'll read the book and wonder ""Could I have lived through this?"" I'm sure it was not pleasant for the author to dredge up these remarkably clear memories and write about them, but we owe him a debt of gratitude for doing so."
1,Draw Manga Chibi! (Xtreme Art),not for beginner artist its just a coloring book ... although I admire Mr. Hart for his other books which I give most of them ( 5 ) starts ... I think this book is just a small piece of cake for kids to have fun ... BUT its not a DRAW book
2,should be more critical,"Blessing In Disguise relates many patient accounts but in only a portion of these was clinical death recorded or reported to the reader. Many cases are used where patients were only under heavy medication or anesthesia this is not the proper study of NDE's since halucinations are too common. The book also overwhelmingly interprets patient accounts in terms of the paranormal such as astral planes, astral projection and mediums etc.. The book also seeks to see the reported NDE's in a theoretical model that is opinion. I am well read on this subject and have carefully interviewed people who told me of their NDE's. Though the book received positive reviews from other writers The reader should rely on more scientific, critical works such as Dr. Morse's CLOSER TO THE LIGHT. The book was not proof read well since there are a number of typographical errors."
4,Many good points,"I liked this one and find myself readingparts of it over again. I am a harsh criticon a number of these books, so this is actuallya very high compliment. Not all people tell thetruth, unfortunately. I also realize that many ofthese experiences do reflect our personal beliefs,and take that into consideration. Howard Storm'sstory is so personal and sincerely written, that Irate it the best of the negative NDE experiences."
5,Brilliant & Terrifying,"If you're one of those horror fans who always feels let down at the end of a scary movie because it just wasn't intense enough, this is the DVD for you.Imagine taking acid and playing an old Barbara Streisand LP on 45 while eight friends stand around you in a circle wearing clown masks, twirling around in circles, and screaming at the top of their lungs.Now imagine doing all of that under a strobe light with a police siren going off in the background, and you're still not even close to touching the level of insanity that is Shaye Saint John."
3,"Too little, too short, unless you haven't played BG/BG2","I bought Icewind Dale and HoW together, and still found that it lacked the length and complexity that I have come to expect from Black Isle products. If you have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2, then you will probably love this game: it is still better than most of the stuff out there. If you have, you will be a bit disappoited. But buy it anyway. It is worth a play."
1,Two Pieces Of Junk For The Price Of...Two,"Before you run out and make a commitment to the worst RPG game on the market complete with an expansion pack, consider what you might buy with your hard-earned dollars instead. Icewind Dale was so disappointing it just made me sick. And the fact that I had the expansion pack to boot didn't make me feel any better. I don't know that I have the words to explain why it is so bad. I think it is sufficient to leave my testimonial. Spend you money on something else. That's all that needs to be said"
5,Making Music with Hits from 1999!,"Excellent service, fast delivery, great products. Thanks for everything, I'm now playing some of my favorite hits!"
5,Great Item,"This press works very well. It is easy to clean, and makes great coffee! I thing french presses are wonderful! They really bring out the flavor in coffee."
3,Makes Great Coffee - but doesn't stop brewing,"This coffee press makes great coffee. The only problem the coffee press does not stop the brewing process. If you purchase this product for one or two people, you will need to have a carafe or thermos on hand to pour the coffee into; otherwise, it can get too strong to drink if you make a full pot. I would like to see Bodum make a coffee press similar to the tea press, which has a chamber in which you press the tealeaves in order to stop the brewing process. This item is a bit expensive. My husband has a similar item that came in the box with his thermos. You just sit it on top of the coffee cup and use a cone filter. It works the same without the expense."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible...",We need to implant an idea into his head so we can make money.Lets do this in the most overly dramatic way possible.Terrible movie...
1,148 Minutes of Nonsense,"Continous chasing, shooting, and 'limbo' everywhere. It was so absurd I had to excuse myself so I could go laugh in the bathroom. I would have had trouble keeping a straight face delivering my lines if I were one of the actors. In the end, we all needed a 'kick' to wake up from our confusion."
1,One of the worst,"I have to say that of all of the movies that I've watched in the last 30 years this one is in to top 10 worst movies. It stunk. For the life of me I can't understand why people were so impressed with this movie. If I could give it negative stars I would. And yes, I get the story line - it's not really all that complex - it's about planting an idea into someone's subconscious. And the way the movie ended, I was like ""oh my gosh you have got to be kidding me!"" Walk, don't run, away from this movie. You're much better off buying just about anything than this garbage."
1,"Confusing plot, shallow characters","While watching Inception, I found myself wishing it would end. I kept watching because I wanted to see whether the protagonist gets back to see his children. The idea behind the plot is intriguing: affecting a person's subconscious. But, it drags on too long and with too many confused references. I never really knew what was going on and found I didn't care. I enjoy Dicaprio's performances normally and have always liked Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard in whatever they do; yet I wished throughout the film that the characters be much more developed. The action scenes were spectacular but I never fully understood why they were taking place other than to make the film attractive to an action-oriented audience. I enjoyed the scene in the hotel hallway with two men fighting in a weightless state and the computer graphic renderings of a city in 3-D. Clearly a lot of effort and talent went into the film but it does not come together for my taste."
2,"Unsympathetic lead character, hard to follow.","Inception is movie to watch in a theater not at home. The movie is long (2 1/2 hours?) fast paced and is difficult to follow unless you give it your full attention. I had to backup the movie to catch what had happened too many times.Unfortunetly I didn't find the lead character sympathetic enough to hold my interest. The special effects were good, but seemed to repeat, the snow machines were the best part of the film. The ending was unrealistic. I did watch the whole movie but it was a struggle, never again."
2,Mediocre,"A shallow movie which attempts intelligence but falls drastically short. Uninspired, laden with achingly bad dialog that even DiCaprio can't salvage, predictable plot, poor character development, and a finale that made me cringe."
2,Vastly overrated; confusing; impossible to follow story line,"I reviewed this movie on a pay per view channel of Dish Network. I figured with all the hype and the class actors in it, that it would be a good movie. Not so. I found it impossible to figure out what was happening or where the story was going. I just may be too stupid to intellectually enjoy this poorly presented film. I do not recommend anyone buying it unless you have an IQ in the genius range or so much inquisitiveness that you find it compelling. That, I do not have; I am only average at 125. Thus, for me, turning the movie off after watching only a bit over half of it was a relief for both my mind and my senses."
1,Absolute junk,A terrible concept at inception. It amazes me that this outlandish movie had financial backing.what an absolute waste of $1.99.
1,"Very, Very bad, No Picture, No Sound.",I waisted my money and time on this purchase. No picture to watch and no audio sound to hear the movie.
2,Inception,"The movie had to much going on. I think I got what the movie was about but, not really sure. Dreams within a dream concept."
1,hell no,i watched only 5 minutes of this trash and got bored with it. I dont have time for getting my mind confused with this crap
1,Wake up audiences!!!,It's unfortunate that all the people that really liked this movie couldn't wake up and realize that it's really just a steaming pile of poo.
5,Good movie,"I enjoyed the movie. Good characters, good plot, incredible images. I did catch things the second time I watched it that I missed the first time. so it stands up to re watching. There are things that confused me but for the most part it was a great movie and deserves all of the praise that it has gotten."
5,Inception Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy,"Great Movie, wonderfull edition. The quality of image and sound it's great, only the extras are a little bit disappoint BUT, the movie it's worth."
2,I wanted to like it,"Good actors, great cgi. But the story had no weight. All the shooting and explosions were just a video game, a dream. And way, way too long. And who cared?"
3,Feeble Extras on DVD,"I enjoyed ""Inception"" immensely in the movie theater and was looking forward to reviewing it in detail when I got the DVD.Even though I like the movie a great deal -- I have deducted two stars because the DVD comes up painfully short in the extras department.Yes, there are a few extras, but THEY'RE painfully short -- probably twenty minutes in total -- and there's NO director's commentary. I think that the previews run longer than the extras.Shame on WB. Such a highly regarded film deserves a much better DVD release -- and reserving some of the extra content for the BR package is NO excuse.The studios would love us all to move up to BR, but many of us still have SD CRTs -- and given the dearth of quality programming on TV these days, that isn't likely to change until our trustworthy old tubes die out.So I'm sorry to report that this is far from the dream DVD I was hoping for..."
5,2-Day Shipping a Joke,"Movie is awesome and very well done. Amazon advertised ""get it the day it releases"" with 2 day shipping which is incorrect. The movie released to DVD yesterday and USPS does not expect a delivery until tomorrow (two days after the release). If Amazon is going to advertise it, they should ensure it. I can understand acts outside of their control, but Priority Shipping with USPS apparently does not garauntee the 2 day delivery."
1,Terrible Loss Of Video/Audio Sync,"The audio/vide sync was terrible, especially with any dicaprio monologue.I have a samsung bd-d5500, onkyo receiver, samsung 7000 series TV. The receiver is set to pass the streams straight through. So it is not an equipment problem."
3,Digital Copy Expired - And we're all OK with this?,"I bought this on Black Friday 2011. I thought I was getting a bluray disc, DVD, and a digital copy. The digital copy expired on May of 2011. I seriously don't understand how they can get away with this? Why is this OK? Checking the milk in my fridge.12/27/2011 update - It's working now!"
4,Great movie!,"I appreciated the story line of this film. I would have rated it five stars, however the first half is a little disjointed and slow. It takes a while to get the story line moving. The movie would have been better if it had another hour to set up the characters and story because the concept is very complicated. By the second half I was completely sucked in and I loved the ending. I would recommend this movie to someone that is looking for a unique movie that is thought provoking and exciting."
4,GREAT MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS FULL OF SUSPENSE AND ACTION. IT KEEPS YOU THINKING RIGHT TO THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE. GOOD MOVIE!!!! HERB.
5,Outstanding quality - both the movie and the discs,"The quality of the film is outstanding - but the discs are better! This set of 3 discs for less than 18 is a great buy - for anybody who wants to see or collect this movie.Awesome plot, beautiful music. Anything else? A movie worth watching over and over again!"
2,Sound Poorly Done - Dynamic Range was Extreme,"The Dynamic Sound Range in Inception was extreme. I have to wonder if the sound was actually re-engineered for Blu-Ray. I have a decent sound system with an Integra DTR-40 AV Receiver and Fluance speakers. If I had the volume set to hear voices, which seemed overly soft in much of the movie, I was overwhelmed by noise in the action scenes. The system has been fine tuned over several months and although sometimes a particular event like a cannon boom might be a bit loud, Inception had me constantly turning down the volume and then back up again to hear the voices. I finally had to use the Late Night mode."
3,"Great Special Effects, Action, Cast....But Can Somebody Please Tell Me What The Hell Was Going On??","I will give this movie 3 stars automatically for it's stellar cast, the cutting edge special effects,and the amazing action sequences which keep it moving and definitely makes this movie not a bore at all!But I've watched it twice now, and though I know it has to to with dreams, the subconscious mind,what is reality and what isn't....I have to admit that I still don't fully get it!Can somebody please explain it to me?--At your leisure, in the comments section.I'm not too proud to admit that the concept and script of this film were a bit over my head.But in no way do I think this was a bad movie at all!---It definitely engages you on many levels.Maybe if I had understood it fully, I could've given it 5 stars."
2,strange,Wow you have to be on your toes when you watch this film becuase it is very strange how they try to get into peoples minds. Didn't like this type of mive and couldn't watch it all.
2,Inception,"I rented this movie without even realizing that I had already rented it previously. It wasn't until I started remembering some of the scenes when I had realized I had already seen it. I guess that sums up about how much I was impressed by the movie. Thought it is an interesting storyline, I thought the movie to be boring and too drawn out. I must have fell asleep through half the movie the first time I saw it. Save yourself some time. If you're going to watch it, watch just the beginning, then skip to the end. You really don't need the rest of the movie."
3,A story without any head or tail...,"This movie has no head nor tail. It seems to me that the purpose of this movie was to launch senseless video games where player pass from one scenery to another, one level to another. The concepts of this film could have been very interesting. However, the story was very poorly developped. The film should have been cut. I am giving 3 stars for the actors/director's work and efforts, the effects and scenery, but I did not like this movie."
1,I am sure the movie is really great,the streaming seemed to be a problem the music and background sounds drowned out the voices so we could not hear what they were saying over 80% of the time sooo basically missed the whole movie...... will have to get it from netflix and try again.
2,Hard to follow,"I found the movie to be very confusing from the beginning and never really understood what was going on. I would have to watch this movie over and over to figure it out and I don't like to work that hard at a movie, I want to be entertained."
2,For as much as I was told I'd like this movie...,I really did not like this movie very much. I found it to be long drawn out and predictable. I lost interest about halfway through and suffered through the remainder of it. I probably should have just turned it off.
2,The Matrix meets Ocean's 11,"Seriously, I don't get the hype about this movie. It's not that complex. It's just The Matrix with dreams instead of a computer program with the heist element of Ocean's 11 (12, 13, etc). There's virtually no character development, like how instead of keeping to himself about Mal, Leo Di Caprio just blurts his heart out to a girl he just met a couple of days ago. I didn't care about any of the characters and it's a concept that's been done to death."
4,Digital copy EXPIRED!,"I purchased this [Blu-ray - DVD - Digital copy] combo pack, but when it arrived, it was THREE DAYS past the expiration date for the download of the digital copy! Total rubbish. Only reason I gave it 4 stars."
4,Great quality shipper and item... movie was okay.,Thanks for fast shipment and a flawless movie! It was in great shape! The movie was good except for the ending. Blah. THanks!
2,"Overrated, DULL","This movie is like a boring version of the old DreamScape movie from back in the 80's. A lot of empty attempt at minimalistic style and pretentious concepts that are totally unfounded even for a sci-fi film. Most of this film makes no sense, the layers or dreams, subconscious etc, it's all overly done to the point of making the film a laughable joke. These stealthy mind jackers can completely subdue the host? the host can't break out in some infinitely variable phantasmagoric random dream sequence? nope, nothing... for a movie based on dreams this has to be the most empty, boring piece of hype i've ever watched. With all the modern film technologies to draw from and this is all this loser director can muster for a dream based movie? boring empty imagery, stupid sound track with retarded wonky ""kick"" soundtrack lol, it's a joke. Jean Cocteau did some of these stunts decades ago and with superior effect. I'd say go back to Batman, you can't cut it in the big time to the director."
2,not very good quality,"It doesn't have the quality as it should be. not like a DVD, but more like a video CD. It doesn't even have a digital sound. disappointed."
1,Zzzzzzz,What a disappointment and waste of my time. Even Leonardo DiCaprio couldn't hold my attention with the convoluted and sleep-inducing premise of this movie.
2,Disappointed,The DVD came opened with the front cover ripped. Aren't brand new DVDs supposed to be completely plastic wrapped? Seems like someone had a viewing of my DVD before I did!!
2,"Depressing, not as entertaining as I'd hoped","I just thought this was dreary. The mystery of it all is intriguing enough at first, and the special effects are amazing, but then, well, you find out what there is to find out and I thought it was depressing.I got a copy, buying blind, to save myself the video rental hassle should I want to re-watch repeatedly, but wound up giving it to the library."
3,inception,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
4,digi copy,"I have seen a lot of questions about this having a digi copy. Just got mine today and it DID have one but it expires May 6, 2011. Good movie, worth every penny especially when you get all the different types of media included here!"
4,Good Price and Delivery Time - Wierd Movie,"This item was priced reasonably and was delivered in a timely fashion for Christmas.The movie it self, though production value was invested, was hard to follow, both because it jumped around a lot and because many scenes were dark and hard to see details of what was going on.It wasn't anything like what I anticipated from the coming attractions shown on TV. Worth a watch, but I think I'd rent it instead"
2,Digital copy expired !!!,I bought the DVD during the Black Friday sales at $4.99. I love the story but very disappointed that the Digital Copy has expired on 05/26/2011.Why would it expire? I totally don't understand.
5,Inception,"Most intelligent movie. I love this movie. I have already watched it for 13 times. Story, cast, background music, and visual effects are mind blower.I preordered this movie. It was for $17.99, the loswest price in the market. Plus, amazon didn't charge any tax. Plus, I received this movie within two days. Plus, I received free $5 video on demand promotion. So, I love amazon since I joined.""Both thumbs up."""
3,Interesting Movie,"At moments it's a little difficult to understand because it's a dream over a dream...I need to see it again, I didn't understand the final part..."
5,wonderful!,"I received this DVD just a couple days after ordering it. Speedy service and very professional, will use in the future!"
4,Intellectually Challenging Thriller,"Though a bit overrated by the critics it is nonetheless an intellectually challenging thriller with stunning visual special effects. Friends, especially older ones, had told me that they didn't like it because it was difficult to follow. I not only found it not to be the case but rather easy to follow once you understood the premise. Good entertainment."
5,Mindblowing!,I just rented this off of Amazon Video on Demand and I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects and storyline are so complex and insanely good. I loved this movie! I recommend it to anyone that likes a good action movie with an equally good storyline.
2,Sad to say it was tedious,"This is the kind of movie that I love, so I hate that I didn't like it. This movie is too long and has a weak storyline. All of the action sequences seemed like they had been copied from a Bond film. The movie is visually interesting, but the writing is so poor that I didn't really care about the characters."
3,Not Nolan's best,"There are some inconsistencies that I'm still trying to work out after my second viewing. The premiss is awesome, as are most of the ideas presented. It's not my favorite work of Nolan's, but it's worth watching."
1,"Film is good, but Warner brother's digital copy feature sucks! do not buy this DVD","Rewview is about blu-ray and features promised by WB and not about film. Film is good but studio WB sucks!I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD. Inside the package there is a leaflet which gives redemption code to download the digital copy for your iphone/itouch device. It gives the steps to download the digital copy.1. Go to [...]2. Follow the instruction to get your digital copy3. When prompted, enter the autorization code.When I go to the site, it says in simple 4 steps you can download your digital copy. But page only gives two steps for itunes. I tried this several times. Warner brother sucks! If you care to buy digital copy go and buy directly on itnues. Do not buy warner brother blu-ray/DVD package. Greatly disappointed with WB."
1,It sucked...,"The soundtrack was insanely loud, the vocals from the actors were mumbled and the plot was chaotic. My girlfriend and I watch a lot of movies on my quality setup and this one distinguished itself with the number of times we turned to each other and said ""what the hell did he just say?"" I really disliked this movie."
3,"Lotta buzz, but I don't agree","About the movie: I was not particularly impressed with the movie. To me, it depended a lot on the special effects and gee-whiz concepts. I felt that the special effects (and they are pretty spectacular) and some of the editing (esp. editing emphasizing the unusual - and sometimes brilliant - concepts) sometimes got in the way of the story, leaving me a little confused. I was left feeling that I wanted to see the movie over again to catch more of what was going on. An opposing example is Avatar where the effects were major but did not really get in the way of the story. Or see much older example of a story not impeded by effects; look at the movie Dark Crystal.About the purchase: The 2-disks set was exactly what was promised and was delivered promptly and trouble-free. The picture in BD was vivid and detailed. Be aware that the BD Live download can take a little while the first time you watch the movie."
2,Digital Copy,"Hey, Warner Brothers, don't sell me a DVD with a digital copy and then tell me the offer has expired in May 2011."
2,Strange movie,This movie was pretty difficult to follow although it was well made. It was hard to follow the plot without knowing the details ahead of time but might be better if you knew the story line prior to watching it.
5,Sick,This movie will have you thinking! It's defiantly a trippy movie. I have not regretted buying with movie at all. I first saw this movie in theaters and had to watch it again and again.
2,Pay strict attention. Hard to relax and watch with so many twists.,"The movie has a plot but it makes a Robert Ludlum novel seem to be very simple. It is always testing you to see if you know where they are.Overall, enjoyable, but not one of LD's better movies."
3,Pretty cool,"I thought that this movie was really cool. I enjoyed that it had action that it had, and I liked that it keeps you on your toes. I also like that you need to use your brain a little bit to keep up with whats going on. If you like all of the things that I have described then you will not be disappointed."
3,Intense,"Plot becomes extremely intense a plot within a plot within a plot within a plot Within a plot. Ok movie if you have nothing else to do and you can devote your undivided attention to from start to to finish. But if you are like me and was trying to do other other things as this movie ran next to my computer, you will bEcome sorely disenchanted with the entire movie."
3,strange film,Made me anxious. I don't like movies that make me anxious. Other than that it was good. So I rented a happier movie the next night to off set it. I recommend you do the same.
2,Very tedious,"I couldn't finish this. I was overwhelmed by the tedium, the constant shifting back and forth between reality and dream. After awhile, I no longer cared who was dreaming and who wasn't. The old dream within a dream is a dreadful cliche, a staple of old TV shows like the ""Twilight Zone."" The plot, some mumbo-jumbo about a corporate takeover, gets lost amid the CGI and the constantly throbbing and annoying soundtrack. This is one of Leo DiCaprio's lesser efforts. The script is weak and the acting is nothing special. It's all special effects, and the tale is one you won't want to remember. Skip without fear."
2,Just OK,"Visually stunning, but the plot was weak.I found this movie to be very uninteresting. Especially compared to Memento and the Batman series."
3,Hype,"The concept of the film was very interesting. I would even say that several elements of the film were interesting. The great shocking moment at the end of the moment was almost a relief, rather than revelation. I don't think the movie lives up to the hype.Entertaining, excellent acting, but other aspects seemed to just go on and on dragging things out. There are several areas where you just feel like you don't know what's going on."
2,Plot is confusing,"This futuristic thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio operates on the premise that your mind can be hijacked while you are sleeping and your thoughts can be both stolen or changed by dream invasion. This film earned almost $300 million at the box office to prove how worthy it is, but the film falls flat for me. Although the special effects are dramatic (and Oscar worthy), the plot is confusing and character development is ignored."
5,Epic,"Great and original. Super exciting and believable. If you cant follow this movie, you might need to go back to school! j/k its great though."
3,"""The Matrix"" meets ""Vanilla Sky""","The concept seems original at first but the more you watch the more you realize that this movie is little more than ""The Matrix"" meets ""Vanilla Sky."" Now, these were both cool movies but that's, in part, because they were both original at the time. Aside from this, ""Inception"" is a very complex story which end up being kind of slow. Plus, (unless I just missed something, which is possible) there seemed to be some holes in the plot. On the visual side, there were some very impressive camera tricks but that, alone, does not a good movie make. Based on people raving about this movie, I had expected something more.Not bad but not recommended."
4,Inception OR Live-action Paprika,"Inception was great. It really really was. But if you've ever seen Paprika, it will all seem pretty familiar. Like deja vu. That's NOT a bad thing."
3,intresting movie,"just watched this movie not sure if i understand it completly i think i need to watch it again, some parts i just dont understand ."
3,Digital Copy?,"I love this movie. I just got a blu ray player, and a itouch so most of the blu rays I received as presents have the digital copy in it. If you buy this movie just for the digital copy, don't bother. It expired and you can't use it at all. Maybe they should put something on the case that the digital copy expired in May."
4,Director Nolan Gets Adult Supervision and Budget,"You may be familiar with student-film-type flick Memento by this gentleman. It was a mess, charitably perhaps because there was no budget so leftover 1950s B/w film stock was used in large part, also no essential ""continuity"" person could be hired. Here is recognizable sci-fi, with real actors, a real composer, several thousand little people to supplement the multiple producers in several countries, on an A-movie Warner budget. Real scriptwriters with a real continuity department: the crucial difference restraining off-the-wall feedback loops to what makes (sort of) sense almost-linearly. Accessible, perhaps (self-plug) because my dissertation was solved in 14 non-intersecting dimensions while Inception occurs in only 1 reality and 4 (maybe 5) intersecting planes of possibility. But it makes more sense than The Matrix, does not involve cyber/steampunk, and can be watched again enjoyably. Purchasing the soundtrack, my subwoofer needs to be worked out."
1,DIGITAL COPY HAS EXPIRED!,"WARNING: The digital copy for this movie has expired. If you want the DVD and Blu-ray, get another set, not this one!"
5,Awesome movie!,"What can you say, a great movie with a great cast. Not your typical over the top CG effects type movie, but one with cool effects and deep thought provoking dreams!"
5,Possibly One of the Best,This was definitely one of the best films I saw in 2010. It looks and sounds fantastic on my television/blu ray player at home too.
1,poor storytelling,"I watched 45 minutes of this before deciding it was too boring to continue. If you love CG effects and don't care about an interesting story, this movie is for you. You have to wonder why an original, creative storyline is a rare animal in hollywood."
1,Excellent effects but that's it,"I found this movie a confused jumble. It was one of those ""huh?"" movies. It was often unclear who the good guys and bad guys were or what exactly was happening. This was one of the rare sci-fi movies that we watched, then tossed. The effects were very good, but I found this movie to be all effects with little substance. That can be okay with even a predictable, rudimentary story, as long as the story is clear and can be followed. Unfortunately, the elements of good storytelling were largely missing from this movie, and the effects, good as they were, couldn't carry it. I'm a lifelong sci-fi can, and if you want real sci-fi, get Alien or Terminator and skip this one."
2,Major Sound Problems with this Blu-Ray - Beware,"I ""think"" I really was liking this film, until major sound sync problems happened during the last 30 minutes or so (and continued to the end). At first, I thought ""oh, with all of these dream layers, maybe this is something Nolan is doing to mess up our minds."" When the film finished, I googled, and there are scores of postings about sound sync problems with the INCEPTION Blu-Ray. There's likely a reason a two disc set is $7.99, and it's terrible that such a major tech kind of film is produced so poorly.Boo. Hiss."
1,Pointless mixture of sound and moving objects...,"How far are we from creating very long movies containing only explosions, special effects, loud music and ""action"" without any or little sense, purpose and meaning?I think we are already there with the ""Inception"".The ""explanations"" of the rules inserted in to the movie at all the time, is nothing more than explanation of the rules in the video game before you begin to play, after that all there is left, is a video game like movie, with one huge difference, you don't hold the joystick in your hand.And this is what makes this movie a bore, you can not even interact with that stream of nonsensical intense and bizarre action, so it becomes almost instantly boring and annoying cacophony of never ending sounds and moving, exploding and falling objects...Hey Mr. Nolan, ever try to understand concept of building and exploring ""gripping"" story lines and characters?"
2,2 stars only because the acting was good,"This movie is not mind bending at all, this movie is a rip off of Vanilla Sky (Abre Los Ojos) and The Matrix. I was hoping for a twist at the end so it could save the movie, but that never happened, its very predictable ...halfway thru the movie you'll have an idea of what kind of ending is gonna have."
2,Monkey See ... Monkey Do,"The actual Blu-ray is nice ... the sound is exceptional and the blu-ray transfers is one of the better ones I've seen. the movie, however, is a less desirable. the script is convoluted, and the acting (except for the actress playing the wife) lacks any depth. I felt ellen page wasn't the best fit for this flick (i get she's us and her job is to push at the reality on our behalf)...there are moments that her character does things that seem not of her character, in the way that leo seemed to just walk through the role with a pinched look on his face. the train effect was alright not that spectacular...the movie homages (2001 et al) seems to exist in the film only to show the film makers ability to recreate the scenes and less with the story."
1,Inception...deception...waste of time,"My husband and I watched this on DVD last night. I wanted to see it in the theater, because of all the hype, but never got around to it. I am glad I waited for the DVD.The movie was a mess right from the beginning. My husband left the couch for a game of WoW 30 minutes into the movie. I decided to sit and watch the whole thing. You would need a score card to keep track of all that was going on. The story wasn't a story. It looked like 3 or 4 differenet scenes from different movies. Very confusing.Going into someone's dreams didn't seem to be what it was all about...more like Leo's character's obession about trying to find himself.If I were to compare it to another movie that I wasted money on, it would be Hereafter. Another dismal movie.Don't waste your time on this lemon."
5,Love it,I absolutly love this movie it keeps you interested! I got it for a good price plus if you buy severaly movies at a time they will package them all together and usually qualify for free shipping!
2,Broken Logic and Missing Promises,"It was great to see DiCaprio and Page again, but overall, this movie left my wife and I disappointed.They set up rules in the movie that are broken throughout and the subplot with the ex is ridiculous. The 'mind eff' everyone is talking about at the end is... well who cares? You're supposed to feel for the protagionist, but here, I really don't care about him. I got to meet the children briefly and that was really the only payoff in the entire movie... that and Michael Caine."
4,needed for class,"This one as well I had to purchase for philosophy class and at first I wasn't sold on this movie, however it is quite interesting. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,IMAGINATIVE AND...FORGETTABLE,"The pounding soundtrack, imaginative visuals and sincere performances in Christopher Nolan's latest high-flying mindbender do not ultimately add up to anything more than a loud, noisy, occasionally diverting series of dreams. Explosions, chases and frequent gunfire grow tiresome after the first 30 minutes, and the emotion meant to sustain us - Leonardo DiCaprio's wife and kids - just doesn't. Sorry - this one fell totally flat for me, and had none of the nightmarish sheen that made some of Nolan's other films - Dark Knight and Memento - so memorable."
2,Holy Sensory Overload,"Mega explosions, ultra car chases, repetitive buildings toppling---if this is your idea of testosterone fueled summer entertainment---then go for it. Oh yeah, multiple assassins around every corner. A brilliant concept almost completely ruined by too much action and too many characters. It becomes completely overwhelming when the dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream, culminates in some sort of ""Ice Station Zebra(esque)"" nonsense. JEEZ--the audience needs a breather!DiCaprio's talents are completely wasted. The subplot with the dead wife was strangely reminiscent and done much better in ""Shutter Island."" Gordon-Levitt was miscast(way too young for the part). Ellen Page fares slightly better as the so-called ""dream architect.""Kudos for the awesome art direction and set design--I would bet my bottom dollar an Oscar or two is definetly in store.I really wanted to like this movie--but in an eggshell--it was just TOO MUCH."
1,VERY CONFUSING :-S,Sorry but I didn't like this movie...I have two words to describe it: B O R I N G &C O N F U S I N G!!!!
1,Inception,"Sorry to say this is the most confusing film I've ever watched! Made absolutely no sense, at all. Thank God I didn't buy the DVD as it would have been a waste of money. As it is, all I managed to waste was a few minutes of my life. Leo get 99 demerits for not refusing to star (?) in this movie. Good Grief! What one won't do for the almighty buck!"
1,"Hi, my name is Leonardo. Do I have to put this on my resume?","(Insert voice of 6 year old girl) BOOOORRRRRINNNNNGGGGGG!The new high water mark for overblown big budget horsehockey. A visual feast ofhorriblenissity. Beautiful nonsense. If you are smart you will hate this flick,if you think you're smart you will no doubt love this thing. And before you hatersstart telling me what an idiot I am, I watched this ""film"" exactly 1 1/2 timesbefore hanging it up. Its absurd jibberish cloaked in some cool special effectsand cursed by a tongue-tied feebleminded script."
2,Special Effects A++ Story Line Complete Crap,"Inception had great special effects and lots of action but the story was utter stupidity. OK, so everyone goes to sleep and everyone enters each others dreams, WHAAAAT??!!!! Very confusing, the explanation must've come during the 20 minutes that I literally fell asleep during this movie. I rented it from the red box for a buck, I wouldn't give another buck to see it again. Kind of reminded me of The Matrix movies which were by the way excellent, at least they were ""somewhat of a believable fantasy"" being physically hard wired to a main computer system."
1,"Too Long, Too Drawn Out, Too Complicated","I have to say I was excited to see this movie hearing from so many how good it was. It was terrible. Way too long. It was very drawn out and kind of silly if you ask me. A dream within a dream within a dream. Levels? What is this, a video game? I did not think Ellen Page was suited for that type of role. There were too many elements to it. Too many scenes, drawn out scenes. And is it just me or did the van take way too long to hit the water? Bad movie."
2,it was OK,Maybe it was better in the theatre but I thought Inception wasnt any better or worse than any other mind binder type of movie
1,Juvenile,Juvenile for an idiotic plot premise. Juvenile for wooden acting. Juvenile for loud booming noises. Juvenile for lots of things blowing up and falling down. Juvenile for lots of flames. No wonder juveniles love it...
1,UNACCEPTABLE,The product arrived broken. It had a major crack in the disc and I tried to report this information for a trade or refund and was unable to figure out how to do it easily. I later found out that at walmart there were several of these products with this defect on them.
1,Arrived Only one-disc (DVD),"six month ago i purchased two-disc edition, but it had not reviewed (did not have the BR-Player). Only now i bought de Blue-ray player and I realized that was not BR disc only DVD disc. I know it's late to make a claim but... I am unhappy ..."
2,Product not as advertised,"I just received this DVD in a very timely manner. Or should I say a version of this DVD. The seller, Miriam Ulrich, did not indicate that the version she was selling was what I believe to be one sold in Canada(Quebec). French and English versions of the title are on the front and everything on the back is also in French and English. I purchased a DVD like this before and didn't have problems with it. I hope I don't have problems with this one either. I just wish Amazon would do something about this type of false advertising."
1,rip off,"this is a pretty awesome product . . . . if you live in the uk that is. if you live in north America its a freaking rip off. you cant download the digital copy through tunes, and the dvd doesn't work on any American dvd players or other players such as computers or game consoles. in short don't waste your money on this if you live in America."
4,Intercept Ideas at Inception,"This movie has got it where is counts, here are the things that I like about this movie:[1] Mind-Bending Plot[2] Great acting[3] Superb Special Effects[4] Plenty of Action[5] Suspenseful MusicUnlike most movies, this film has a high degree re-playability; meaning that you don't get everything in one sitting. I would say that by the third time you will be able to fully understand the plot, and appreciate its full depth.Initially, you are not sure what's happening. But as a new dream architect is enlisted, you learn along with her.At the height of the movie, the action unfolds on 5 levels, each with its own perspective on the speed of time, as follows:- Real World- First level dream- Second level dream (inside of first dream)- Third level dream (inside of second dream)- Limbo (where you go, if you die inside of a nested dream)This film is a must-see as far as I am concerned. It is a real Thriller to the very end."
4,Using more than 20% of your brain,"I definitely felt like I was using more than 20% of my brain after watching this movie. It definitely required the memory bank to delve deeper at there were multiple layers of dreams that were being explored. Add in the fact that there was another layer that was not clear if the current reality was a dream or not, was the kicker; user interpretation determines the answer. Definitely a great movie on it's own which is enhanced onto the Bluray disc for it's well mastered audio & video quality. Highly recommended on Bluray as it's the best combination of storyline and movie viewing experience!"
3,Inception from Amazon,Inception concept is brand new - travelling through other person's dreams and that too iterating through the dreams. Movie is great with good sound quality. No Sub-titles - that is a problem.
3,"It's okay, but not HD","I though it was a HD movie when I first saw it, because the promoting information implied it was ""HD"". But it is NOT. I was disappointed. Other than that, it is a great movie. I just want to say: Please clarify if a certain movie is a HD version or NOT."
2,Movie,All I saw was buffering a little circle going around and around. Won't order any more videos from any one any more.
3,Too deep for me,"A little too much thinking required for my liking. Keeping track off all the dream levels, how they work, and how the characters interact in each others dreams is more complex than time travel!"
4,"Wow, very Matrixy","I couldn't watch this movie and not think of The Matrix. Very similar, but different as well. I may need to rewatch to really understand the ending."
4,Inception - Wow,An excellent movie. One that needs more than one viewing to understand and delve into things missed in prior viewings. It is a movie that keeps you thinking and imaging dreams. It is in the vein of Matrix but much less dark. A movie that I am definitely glad I saw and purchased.
4,Inception,This was a real thriller--kept you riveted to the story all the way through it. It takes you deeper and deeper into a dangerous level of the dream world--a level from which you may never return. What's real...and what isn't?
4,real or memorex,"You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure.I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out.but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinkingI like that...when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off, not sure if it was real or ....it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems.we don't do movie channels, hbo, showtime etc, we pull out our videos and watch them instead."
4,Very Different,I liked this movie very much but needed to stay focused and without interuption to follow the story line. Excellent acting and special effects. Would recommend to friends.
5,"new movie, great price",inception was on sale for 17.99 before the movie came out. comes with dvd blu ray and digital copy. great by.
5,Outstanding Film!,"I loved this film when I saw it in the theater (my personal favorite of 2010). This is a richly complex film that requires several viewings and you will pick up new details with each viewing. So I was excited to purchase the Blu-ray version as soon as it was released. The visual and audio quality of the Blu-ray is outstanding. This is a film I will enjoy many times. I was equally looking forward to the extra features, but was disappointed by what was available in the Two-Disc Edition. Nolan's last DVD release (The Dark Knight) had an outstanding amount of ""behind the scenes"" content and I was hoping to find the same with this film. However (and this is a BIG ""however""), I was not able to access the BD-Live content (my connection seems to be down). So that content may be available once I fix my BD-Live connection problem."
5,Adrenaline Rush,I purchased this blu ray movie as a gift for a family member and after we viewed it we were blown away! I wont go into too many details about the movie itself because I dont want to spoil it but its basically about a group of guys who can travel into other people's dreams in order to steal secret information from them. This movie is filled with twists and fast paced action which kept me on the edge of my seat and unable to predict what would happen next. This movie is great because it breaks away from all the remakes that have been coming out lately and invents somthing more unique. If your ready for a new unique action experience with great acting and special effects then make sure to purchase this movie.
2,What? When? Where? Who? How? How do people even BEGIN to follow this??,"Honestly, movies should never be this darn complicated! If I wanted to think this much, I'd go do some Algebra or try to figure out women. Ridiculously complicated!! If ""Wicker Park"" was hard for you to follow, then don't even think of approaching this tangled up mess of complexities. Do yourself a favor and don't waste what will seem like five hours of your day, or ten hours if you rewind every two minutes to try to ""get"" something. I give it two stars for some cool effects."
4,Nice,I bought from Colombia and everything was good. The movie arrived on time and I enjoyed it a lot.Thank you very much.
4,Great movie!,"Definitely an entertaining movie!The effects are great, the storyline/concept was very interesting, and the graphics are top-notch.If you like the Mission Impossible-type movies, this would be right up your alley."
1,God this movie is awful,"I just watched this movie and found it to be the most confusing, boring film i have ever had the misfortune of viewing, beginning from the very first scene when we see our hero Leonardo lying on a beach to the next scene where he is being interrogated by an extremely old Asian man all the way through to the last scene we are expected to follow a storyline so convoluted and filled with so many characters that we can't really know whose ""dreams"" we are really watching, I was so disinterested i wanted to leave after the first 30 minutes of excruciating confusion but i kept thinking it would get better - it never did, i ended up watching the whole movie but now realize it was a complete waste of 150 minutes."
2,Digital copy expired on 5/26/11,Just bought this on amazon and the digital copy is no longer available. great way to promote pirating movies WB!
2,Inception,"Definitely not my type of movie. I gave it away to a family that liked it. This kind of movie may be interesting to many people, but I want to be entertained, even educated, but not confused."
3,fresh sci-fi concept,The dream tampering idea is a pretty new sci-fi concept to me. It had pretty decent special effects most of the time (some of the explosions in the snow scene appeared fake. Character interest wasn't developed too well in my opinion.
1,Sleep time.,"I'm not a pro at reviews but this totally bored me. IMHO, great sleeping asset. My husband got a good snore out of it as well. Dr.Dement, this movie would assist in sleep apena studies. zzzzz"
1,You've got to be kidding!,It just goes to show how you can pretty much get away with anything and people will call it great. This film insults the mind of anyone who watches. This pile of dung belongs in the trash bin. What a waste of time.
1,"Bad, Bad and then again...works well as a sleep aid","My husband really wanted to see this. So, we clicked the On Demand button on the dvr and voila, instant sominex. I was so bored I wanted to scream. I turned to say something about how bad this film was to my husband and saw that he was out like a light...no doubt ""dreaming"" of watching grass grow which would be much more entertaining than this piece of crap. Hollywood has gone beserk..they charge an awful lot of money to see a movie these days and then give you films like this? Bad!"
1,Avoid due to Ads,DVD contains about 10 minutes of ads that you cannot skip via any means. Get the movie via any other means than this DVD or you are supporting this type of disreputable and disrespectful marketing
2,"Enough exposition for 20 films , enough cleverness for 8","I love Christopher Nolan!!! Truly . I own all of his films but the first Batman film (which is very good) . Perhaps i'm too old ? My wife and i really anticipated watching this film on Blu-ray . The Mrs. wanted to stream it but i felt i'd need the subtitles to keep up with the many characters (great cast) and twists . We made it about 70 minutes into the picture when we turned toward each other for the last time (my wife and i) and laughed . Out-of-there . We had lost interest in everything about the film (particularly the characters) who were not developed at all (in our opinion) . I've seen over four decades of pretension on film . Save it for someone who cares . Even the favorable critics on R.T's have only faint praise for it . If you're really smart and you ""got it"" , bully for you . We're stunned this is being considered for so many awards ? To each their own ."
5,Inception,"Great movie, fast action and good premiss somewhat believable even though si-fy. A good movie to have as a part of your collection"
2,Disappointed....,"For a movie as big as this, I was expecting more from BD.Disappointed, as I found out that:1) The images quality weren't as sharp as I expected. In fact it appears blurry on a 55"" flat screen. There were many scenes in the movie where you can tell that the picture quality weren't good enough, such as Auther's striped shirt, the sky view of Mombasa, the skyscrapers in Cobb's limbo world....2) Special Features were the second disappointment. I was hoping for the commentary, which is all blue-print of a movie, but no. In result, there weren't alot of differents between the BD and DVD features.It's no wonder why they're selling it for $17.99, only one dollar more than the DVD, because for anyone who'll be watching it on 37"" or less, one would buy the DVD for cheaper price, if the BD would have charge any higher."
2,Really???,"I remember watching this movie in the theater. Most movies I watch based on friends recommendations or other people turn out to be total crap. This movie wasn't total crap but it was pointless. The whole point of this movie was for some people to change one guy's mind about global power. Ok. For starters, how did one ordinary man get control of global power in the first place? How did he manage that? Questions aside the main characters attempt to plant an idea inside this man's subconscious to try and get him to change his mind about global power. They also want it to be his own idea. Tell me, how is it your own idea if you didn't think of it? You might think that you thought of it but you didn't. The point of the movie is defeated.I will give credit to the soundtrack though that was good.The video quality is ok.The environments in the dream world have little imagination. Mostly twisting and bending of objects."
2,Problems playing on LG BD370 (Blu Ray),"I LOVE this movie, but the Blu-Ray disk does not play well on an LG BD-370.During some sequences, the audio gets out of sync (badly)I echo the earlier recommendation to rent and try this one on your player before you buy."
1,unhappiness,"i hate amazon they ripped me off, the first movie i tried renting doesn't even work...free movie sites work better WOW"
2,"Predictable, boring and over-rated","Once you've grasped the main idea the film offers few surprises. The snow sequence is very badly organised, leaving the viewer with little idea of relative positioning of characters during action sequences (as if you even care by this stage). The ending is so predictable as to be insulting. Overrated and dull."
2,Also known as Revenge of the Pimple Forehead Woman,"The reality is that this movie just wasn't very good. In particular, the action scenes were for the most part a real mess. Case in point the attack on the fort, a clear sign of a director with no clue. The zero g scenes were interesting though. The story itself was a mess and the cinematography was nothing special. The acting was okay, but nothing exciting. The movie was best described as a watse of time (not to mention all the money spend making it). Oh yeah, and the pimple forehead woman was very distracting."
4,"Good movie, really makes you think","Inception is a good movie with a good idea that pulls it off in a good story. It really makes you think! You'll be watching it multiple times to try and understand it. The music and characters are good, too, making it even more enjoyable. I might sound a bit of a downer, or cliche, or whatever, but the only thing I would'v changed is the ending, it just felt like there needed to be more closure. But, this is NOT one of those cases where the ending makes up the whole movie. So yes, this is an excellent movie with great characters, story, and music, and I do recommend it. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Mind bending in a good way,"A movie of ideas as much as actors, Inception challenges the notions of reality versus imagination with a depth and power rarely achieved in filmed sci-fi. That top movie stars joined in the adventure is just icing on the cake."
5,Once is not enough!,"The first time I saw Inception, I left the theatre a little confused but I had enjoyed the movie. The second time I saw it, I had many aha moments. The third time, it all fell into place. Because Inception is sooo good, I didn't mind watching it multiple times. Kinda like The Matrix, but different. The dream within a dream within a dream concept is fascinating and the movie's special effects are awesome. Good story, good characters. One of my faves."
3,Expired Digital Copy,"Ordered the Blu-ray on Black Friday as ""new"" from Amazon, not a third-party, and what I received was a copy of the movie with an expired digital copy. Beware if you expect to get the digital copy along with the movie."
1,BAD MOVIE,I found it very hard to follow the storyline on this movie. I would never have bought it had I seen it first!!!
1,What?,"Please explain. This is not entertainment. If you need to take notes, pause the film and compare your notes with the others watching it with you, and then vote about what happened, etc., - you're not being entertained. I know they were trying to make this a ""smart"" film and I ""got it"". It just could have been done better without the pretentiousness and the overdone special effects.Boo.....overrated."
1,13 minutes of ads that you can't skip,"Maybe the movie is great, who knows. I've been sitting here for 9 minutes now waiting to watch the movie. Fast forward is disabled, menu is disabled. I'm returning this DVD. This is unacceptable! Warner Brothers should be ashamed."
1,Proof Positive,"We watched this movie last night. I love imaginative plotlines and I love special effects, but this was the most nonsensical, incomprehensible mish-mash of a movie I have ever seen. Everyone who was involved with this movie must have been on high-test designer drugs to take it seriously or even find it the least bit entertaining. What a waste of .money and a couple of hours of my life watching it."
1,Yawn,"Wow,was this movie boring.I didn't like it at all.It was also 30 minutes to long.Don't waste your time on this.I would rather watch paint dry."
1,Maybe It Was Just Me,"Maybe it was just me because this movie was nominated for an Oscar, but I didn't enjoy or understand this movie. The scenery was stunning, but I thought the plot left something to be desired."
1,A nonsensical mess.,"A convoluted, tedious mess of a movie masquerading as ""deep."" I fell asleep twice while watching it. It just goes on and on and on like a bad nightmare from which you cannot awake. It's ironic that a movie about dreams is the perfect cure for insomnia. Update: 30 minutes after writing this review, I finally turned this pretentious bore off for good. With each new ridiculous plot contrivance I was getting angrier and angrier at the inept storytelling and mindless special effects. I couldn't care less what happens at the end. Typical line of dialogue: ""Those are merely projections not reality which we need to extract in order for our totems to reveal what is really a dream within a dream within a dream."" WHAT?!?!? Total piece of crap."
1,So Complicated,"This is one of those movies where the writer was on some sort of drugs when he wrote the movie. I don't know what kind of complicated mind can come up with this. It was so hard to follow, that my best option was to fall a sleep myself in the hopes that I can have a better dream. I cant believe the reviews it got from the experts. I had very low expectations of the movie going to the theater, and it met all of my expectations. A dream, within a dream, within a dream, within that dream. Hopefully go got all that, because that is what you will be facing."
1,disappointing,"Just when you thought it was safe to take a nap ...... Here comes a science fiction flick with unimpressive special effects and no colorful characters. How about suspense? Are we actually expected to care about people who may or may not be dreams? Deplore the demolition of buildings which may or may not be dreams? What else is this movie lacking? It offers no comic relief, no good background music and ordinary costumes. The actors look too much alike and none of them are easy on the eyes. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer attractive and commands little stage presence. Two hours wasted is my opinion of this film."
1,"I gave it a chance, but could not finish it... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!","Leo DiCaprio is such a darling to critics. Anything he is in seems to get better than average reviews. Even Leo can't save this mess!Something happens, followed by 10 minutes of dialogue. Something else happens, followed by 20 minutes of dialogue. Repeat that senerio over and over again throughout the movie.Also, there are plenty of characters introduced throughout all the dialogue. It's a chore to keep track of all these characters and what they are even doing there, or why they appeared to begin with.Talk about plot holes! There are plot holes within' plot holes within' more plot holes.I gave this 1.5 hours and turned in off. At that point, I could have cared less what happened. I still don't.Thank you for reading. I may be right and I may be wrong. Never trust a critic for sure! Until then...."
1,Cowboys and Indians again,"At least two thirds of the movie was Cops and Robbers. Good Guys and Bad Guys. Same old, same old. Nothing but testosterone. Fist fights. Cold blooded machine gun murders. Blowing things up along with unecessarily loud, overly dramatic music throughout. I stopped caring what it was about halfway through and just wanted the gunfire and explosions to stop. Huge disappointment. I wish I could get my $3.99 back from renting this movie."
2,Kind of soulless,"While I appreciate a ""high"" concept, the way it was made just overall bored me to death. It was too antiseptic. Pretentious too. Overrated hype."
2,Too weird for words!,Last night we watched Alice in Wonderland and thought it was so weird. Today we watched Inception and thought it made Alice look real by comparison! And enough gratuitous violence to make a James Bond movie look like a child's bedtime story!
3,Fascinating and Puzzling,"At first the storyline is confusing, but then you slowly understand the premise of dreams being within dreams. The dream team's main goal doesn't seem important at first but it does take on a sense of urgency as the story unfolds. It also interweaves Dicaprio's character's own dilemma, which is sad. The special effects are fascinating. It's a good mystery, so I liked this movie."
4,Original but not staying on my shelf,"This is one of those sci-fi movies that delivers, but isn't good enough to keep.PROsoriginalitykeeps movingdigital effectsactiondramastory within storyJames BondishCONscontrivedfits too neatly togetherI think this movie was missing a touch of reality."
5,"Awesome, original movie.","The best movie I have seen since ""The Dark Knight."" Original plot, Extremely tense action, and great actors make this an awesome movie worth watching again and again."
5,Just watch it.,"Capturing both an intelligent story and an action-packed 3rd act, this is one of Christopher Nolan's best. And if you're familiar with such titles as The Dark Knight, the Prestige, Memento and Batman Begins, that is saying something.Just watch it. You won't be disappointed."
1,two thumbs DOWN - dumb dumb movie,"I happen to be a fan of thrillers, horror, drama movies. I like action and a twisted story line. Inception is just so insanely ridiculous and the story is just stretched out too far. I went to see it with high expectations, because of the reviews I'd read and heard from others. I was extremely disappointed and quite honestly, the movie just went on too long. Seeing it once was more than enough for me. There are much better movies out there than this one."
1,Heaven for 14-year-old boys,"Two hours of 14-year-old heaven----noise, 'splosions, running, jumping, dreaming, shooting, hitting, kicking, skiing, yelling, and....s-l-o-w--m-o-t-i-o-n--f-a-l-l-i-n-g-g-g-g.Gad zukes, have we all become mental deficients that we enjoy...actually enjoy... such tripe, such offal, such pap?Films are morphing into games now and not even DiCaprio reciting idiot lines could save it.As for the suggestion that there was something---anything---to think about in this godawful slopfest... there wasn't."
3,"Great movie, Bad dvd","For what I paid, I guess I can't complain too much. But I did think I was getting a brand new DVD. This was not DVD quality and I didn't feel like i got a professional package. But I saw the movie for what its worth"
1,Inception dvd movie,In this movie you have really great actors. But the movie was very boring and did not enjoy it at all. Not recommended in my opion.
2,What was that?,"Inception gave me a strange sense of déjà vu, I felt like I saw this movie earlier in the year and didn't like it when it was called Shutter Island.So is Inception accessible enough to plant the idea of an entertaining experience in viewer minds? In your dreams. No one short of a NASA systems analyst will be able to articulate the plot.One way to salvage some fun with this blunderbuss would be to fall asleep while watching and dream up a better movie yourself. Try it. You'll avoid a headache."
3,Fun not great,There are movies and then there are movies within movies....Please. Don't try to make this movie out to be more than it is. A vehicle for some outstanding special effects and an interesting two dimensional tale that requires some fast and fancy footwork to keep your attention.It is like time travel movies. If you think about them too long they loss the appeal. Take it on its surface and have some fun.Cotton candy served in a five star restaurant. Still fluff no matter where it is presented.
1,If you think Keanu Reeves is a good actor...,"If you think Keanu Reeves is a good actor, you would totally love this movie. If you don't get it, get over it."
4,Watch it twice--its worth it,"I saw ""Inception"" in the theaters, and to be honest, I had some difficulty following it. I can't say that my second watch on DVD cleared up all of my questions, but I was able to pick up on some of the subtleties that make this movie stand above more mundane thrillers. While there are some aspects of the film that are clearly meant to be ambiguous, Nolan peppers the film with just enough hints. I would recommend this film to fans of the TV show ""Lost"" and people who were disappointed by other thriller-type movies like ""Shutter Island."""
3,Inception.,"I am not a fan of Nolan's work except Dark Knight,I noticed The guy from Bronson (Tom Hardy) is in it, Leonardo DiCrapio as I call him is in it and even he pulls off the performance the Hindu looking dude from Drag me to Hell is in here,and Michael Caine(Brief sadly),It is a long tenuous and at times Intense movie. You have to pay close Attention as goes in over and over and Over through many different things all adding to a ClusterF..k. It is decent because well it is original but Originality alone can't save it,Maybe an Art Student can appreciate it.I Neither Liked it nor disliked it,I am just indifferent to it."
2,Didn't Live Up to the Hype,Plot was skimpy. Character development was skimpy. It got two stars only because special effects were great a few times. The movie was a journey without a destination. Relieved when the boredom was finally over.
3,potential not achieved,"I agree with ""Minimalist"" and other 3-star reviews: great idea . . . not so well executed. I really looked forward to renting this movie, and was on high alert for the first part, having been warned of its complexity. About half way through, I was nodding off, since the action scenes were so drawn-out and boring. The creative concept could have been challenging to the mind, but even that was questionable (e.g., it's the rare person who has that kind of detail to work with in their dreams). And it would have been nice to have a less predictable ending. The ethical concept of dream invasion was glossed over, although thankfully not dealt with in a heavyhanded way either. Please listen, Directors: there is a vast audience out here that would appreciate more conceptually challenging work, without all the formulaic explosive melodramatics. It WILL sell, I promise you!"
3,another over hyped in the previews movie,This movie was okay but it was over hyped on all the previews for it making me expect a much better movie. I can only rate this as OK.
5,Nolan never ceases to amaze!,Christopher Nolan not only directs but writes this dramatic thriller. I know that's obvious but sometimes it's hard for my brain to grasp that. The same person who wrote the incredibly original script is the same one who directed and created the incredibly unprecedented images. The whole movie is full proof. Every detail accounted for and no loose gaps. It's beautifully written and directed and believe it or not Nolan found a way to top himself!
5,A MUST SEE!,I will not write a 3 page essay on this movie but I will say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.The storyline and complexity of this film are incerdible and each actor fits their role perfectly. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll at the end.My advice to anyone who doesn't quite understand it after you watch it: watch it again... anybody I have talked to that didn't understand or was confused by the movie said it all made sense after the second time watching... Enjoy
1,"Good movie, raw deal","Firstly, this movie kicked serious you-know-what. It was every bit as groundbreaking as The Matrix. That said, I'm giving it ONE STAR because Warner sux with their digital copy expirations. I too bought this today only to find out that despite nearly every other studio allowing digital copy redemption beyond expiration, Warner is playing the Grinch. To hell with you WB; good movie, raw deal- can't redeem the digital copy I PAID FOR! If you're going to give some BS about how you can't be responsible for retailers selling these movies with expired digital copies, then you need to be more accountable and have those copies PULLED from shelves!"
3,Not sure why the hype,Not horrible but not great. There was a lot of hype around this movie and frankly I think it was just an okay movie. The concept is great and the story line is intriguing but feels drawn out at times and is less intriguing than other movies in the same genre.
4,The illusion of this world,"Many sages and saints from various religious traditions have said that what appears to be real and concrete to us is really more like a dream; and that the most real world is on a higher plane of being. This film explores these ideas in a provocative way. We have all seen what we thought were solid realities, begin to dissolve into nothing, beginning with the Lehman bankruptcy filing on Sept 15, 2008, and the free fall of the stock market for the next six months. Remember, that when the collapse began, no one knew when it would end, or even if it would end. There was no way to know that our economy would not regress to its condition in the Dark Ages, or even the Stone Age. And we still don't know that, really."
4,Explore your own psychosis,"I thought that this film was well directed and cast. The story and the special effects keep your interest and is the kind of film that you wont want to pause so you can see what happens at the end. The only thing that I find fault with is the technology that is supposed to put the individual dreamers into one person's head, but I believe that I have a psychological explanation for that (the whole story isn't quite what you think it is). Anyway, a very entertaining film that keeps you wondering what will happen next."
4,Matrix + James Bond,"The reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because even in the ""real"" world, the gun fights were unreal. Like are they all special forces secret assasins?Also, with so many bullets flying around, you'd think they'd wear body armor instead of their GQ suits.This movie borrowed a lot from the Matrix; from the fights, guns, to having an Architect, and Ken Watanabe being a Morpheus type. It upped the game with better special effects and, do I need to even say it, better acting from the main character.It's all worth it for the nail biting slow motion, everything at stake, life or death build up in the end."
5,Great Movie - Smart,"I dislike stupid movies and unfortunately the majority of the movies are just that, stupid.But Inception by Chris Nolan is smart and well done. What can I say that hasn't been said before. I recommend it. It is smart, intelligent, well acted, well shot, action packed, and overall a good movie to watch."
3,Okay,"I've sure seen worse movies. It was easy enough to follow, for me, but I can see where many would be scratching their heads.The acting was well done and my surprise was Ellen Page who I'd only heard vague references to in the media. This may be her breakout role, at least it is to me.What gets me about this movie is that you never really know what is dream and what is real. That's kind of cool in a way, but you have to wonder if any of these people really exist or are just figments of Leo DeCaprio's imagination. After his work in Shutter Island, I have to wonder.We bought this movie but realized we should have rented it as we'll probably never watch it again. Not because we hated it, but because it just doesn't have any great appeal. Recommended for fans of the actors and director only."
4,"It's no Memento, but...","...if you can figure out why the Ken Watanabe character has aged, it unlocks the entire sequnce of events and makes the film much more interesting. I think Inception was maddeningly conventional, poorly acted, and even inconsistent at times -- but the big idea, which involves Cobb's wife, is really brilliant. There are not many films that can hold a candle to Nolan's masterpiece, Memento, but this comes close in the final reel."
5,Great movie,"This cast has been doing a lot of movies together lately, and they work great together. Great thought provoking and fun to watch movie."
1,boring,Gratuitous action and storyline distortions with an absurd plot. My girlfrind and I were both asleep within 30 minutes. It was kind of like a dream within a dream within a dream ...zzzzzz.
1,don't even bother,"Plain and simple this was one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Too many sub plots and jumping from dream to dream. (and at times it was unsure if they were dreaming to back ro reality). Don't waste your time, much less your cash on this movie."
1,Huh??,this is the worse movie Leo has ever done. I am still to this day trying to figure it out . Dont waste your money
1,Nightmare,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about dreams - many levels of dreams which are so disjointed they are a nightmare to watch. Do NOT waste your time or money on this.
1,"dumb, bad screenplay","there is no explanation for anything that happens in this movie. simply put, rip-off of sunshine of the spotless. talk about a leap of faith, why are we to believe this is real? furthermore, why do we care?? this wonderful dream revelation, and just to use it to screw people? hmmm, the ultimate excuse for computer generated mayhem, i suppose. pretty good cast, but totally wasted, and the little love interest angle with his wife laboring idiotically in limbo, ANNOYING! oh, and the asian donald trump, angling in for his slice of the pie, just stereotypically lovely. everything about this movie screams of trite, from it's prosaic finish to its mindless INCEP TION! trash can.... open and shut!"
2,A Nightmare,"First, let's start with the fact that Leo has gotten fat...I mean fat! It shows in this movie. Second, the story is such a maze, that you literally do not know if you are in the ""here and now"" or in an altered state...hence too many sub-plots. Third, the story line is laughable at best and fourth, the only redeeming feature of this movie is Tom Hardy...who is excellent in his role. So, if you feel like taking a bad roller coaster ride where the effects tell the story, and the story is non-existent, than have it...this is your movie. By the way, did I mention Leo has gotten FAT!"
1,False Advertising,"The video I received is in French. It is the French-Canadian version of Inception, which is not what was advertised or what I ordered. Fortunately, there is the option for English as the main voice-over."
1,Movie for Juvineles,"I wanted to to really like this movie, but the plot was so self absorbed that it missed an essential point - only a twelve year old could believe such a juvenile plot. A dream within a dream, sounds good until you realize that is what most people deal with every morning. This movie left me with one thought, Hollywood is really dominated with simple minded fools that cannot get over special effects and actually write a story that keeps an adults attention. Don't buy or rent this movie, I was do disappointed that I actually spent money on this piece of crap."
1,Adolescent garbage,"This film is ridiculous, confused, and adolescent. A ridiculous premise. Confused development. An explosion every 15 seconds. A movie that seems to have been made by adolescents on LSD for adolescents on LSD. I have three graduate degrees and I was totally lost halfway through the film. I know this film has been a blockbuster and that makes me shudder for American culture."
1,Blu Ray Problems with Audio and Special Features,"This is a review of the blu ray itself and not of the film Inception.First and foremost, the audio cuts out and becomes out of sync on my Blu Ray player (Samsung BDP 1600). This usually happens during the opening of the heist scene when they arrive in the warehouse.Secondly, the behind-the-scene features cut off prematurely.Beyond these technical problems, the Inception Blu Ray is disappointing due to its poor navigation and lack of truly interesting special features. The navigation is slow and confusing due to its many nested layers and silly animation.It's a shame that such a great film was presented in such an unprofessional way. I suggest renting this edition and waiting for an improved subsequent edition of the Blu Ray disc."
1,Wanna be Matrix!!!,"The movie was a good concept and the special effects were pretty good but the plot was too long and too confussing.I give it thumbs up for originality but the plot was too confussing, and at the end when everything came together it was too late. Should have rented it first!!!!"
1,Manufacture screw up,Besides receiving damaged packaging the audio on this bluray is not in sync with the picture. Warner Brothers should be shot for putting out crap like this. I give the bluray a big thumbs down due to manufacturing defect.
5,Some points not described,"There are some topics that are not described in the product, like:- There is Portuguese subtitle, although there is no sign of that in the products images;- Yes, it comes with a key so you can download a digital copy and IT STILL WORKS! (Warner extended the expiration date to 12/19/13)Everything else is just like the description says.Nice product!"
2,overrated,this movie was ok...have watched several times and i still fall asleep everytime...movie was way overrated...i think the movie limitless was better and that movie wasnt hyped as much...
2,Worth watching even though a bad movie,"I would give it 5 stars for the chase scenes and visual effects. 0 stars for a lack of a plot, or characters I care about. Overall = 2 stars."
3,a Massive Mace and Two Broken Arms,"This game is worth the 12 dollars I paid for it. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that the targeting system for the character is off. I agree. It is difficult to target grounded enemies and slow to move about in this game. Having said that, I like the brutality and the different weapons in the game. The targeting system doesn't really allow you to attack specific body parts so the game just gives you different outcomes when using different weapons at different attack angles. You can sever an ememy's arm, pick it up, and whale on him with it. Fun stuff! The cut-scenes are cool but can not be passed."
5,amazing!,i'm not sure if this review will be helpful but this game is just great. the whole feel of being in ancient rome is cool enough but you also get to control two characters. this idea keeps the game fresh because you don't get tired of either character and i must say the stealth missions are just as cool as the gladiator battles.(i said almost!) i dont get too hyped about videogames anymore but the makers of this game really took their time with it. the battles scenes are just amazing and rome looks magnificent. this game is a must have for any videogame fan. i put this up there with grand theft auto on the fun factor but it has more of a realistic feel to it because this is really rome down to a tee. this game is realistic and fun and i reccomend it.
3,Great game for you blood thirsty people. Stealth levels ruin it!,"Honestly I love a good Bloody kill them all game, and Shadow of Rome is my overall favorite.. But when it falls into the category of stealth, it SUCKS! The stealth levels are hard to beat! But, if you are a die hard Splinter Cell/Metal Gear Fan(I know I am) DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! But, if you just do the stupid stealth levels, and get to the killing levels, then THIS GAME IS RIGHT FOR YOU GOD OF WAR FANS!"
3,"Why Stealth, WHY?!?!?!?!?!?","What is the obsession game developers have with stealth these days. Like some of the other reviewers here, I agree that the gladiator/soldier fighting is great. The control system is very intuitive and easy to pick up. If it wasn't for the stupid stealth parts (Octavianus) this game would get a ""five."" I can only hope there is a sequel with fighting only and none of these REALLY LAME stealth missions. Because the stealth parts are SO BAD; this game is not worth buying for $50. Rent it first! I might go back and buy this one six to eight months from now when it's down to $20, but not now. GAME DEVELOPERS PLEASE STOP WITH THE STUPID STEALTH ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,There's a difference between challenging and difficult....,"This game looks and plays great. Unfortunately, the people who made this game don't seem to realize that video games are supposed to be entertaining and not frustrating. I beat the game in ""normal"" difficulty but there were lots of struggles (and cursing) along the way. I would give this game a higher rating if not for the cheap diffulty level. If I wanted to test my skills by fighting hard battles, I'd choose ""hard mode"". That's the reason why some games allow you to choose the level of difficulty. The ""normal mode"" in this one, however is like ""extreme"" in most other games. I don't think I would want to try the ""extreme mode"" or even the ""hard mode"" on this one. Don't buy if you don't have alot of patience! The only thing that kept me trying to beat this game was the story, which I should say was pretty good."
2,Just okay,"The game is alright. Like with many games these days, way too much effort was put into the theatrical intros. The story plot follows the movie Gladiator almost to the T, with a little inconsequencial julius caesar filler story. The fighting is good, but only requires timing to get down. This is by no means a strategy game. I am almost done with it, and I haven't had to think once yet, so I assume the rest is the same. The character switching is lame. Don't listen to the fake reviewers that make it sound all cool. This is the same old same old, but what did you expect. It had been so long since I have played a good game, I took a gamble thinking that the reviews here on amazon were somewhat acurate, but was wrong.2 stars for zero bugs and good 3d environments."
4,Love this product!,"I love this product! My skin felt so soft and silky to the touch. I received several compliments on how nice my skin looked, and how healthy it looked. This product is fabulous."
4,"Great info, great features discussed, diskette would enhanc","As a software instructor, I found this to be as clear as 1-2-3 with enough details to satisfy any level user. However, to be a complete learning tool a diskette with sample files to play with is needful."
3,Jesus Newspaper: The Christian Experiment of 1900,"Michael Smith did a tremendous amount of research on ""The Jesus Newspaper,"" an analysis of the Rev. Charles Sheldon's weeklong ""Jesus Newspaper"" experiment in 1900. The book is a detailed account of Sheldon's publication in light of the history of the era and the religious climate of the day. I was most interested in the historical backdrop, which Michael seems to write about with more enthusiasm than he does the rest of the book. ""The Jesus Newspaper"" is intellectual in tone and is definitely not a quick read. Several portions of the book are rather dry and much information seems redundant, but overall it's an engaging story."
3,Hood has potential,The hood has potential. It is a good concept for those who don't want to wear a hat if it is raining. The snaps don't fit the snaps on the duster. I didn't see an attachment to make them fit. The drawstring did enable me to attach it to the duster for use and it does look like a natural attachment to the duster. It works fairly well with that arrangement.
3,"Silicone Skin - not really a ""workout"" case.","For the low cost, the silicone workout case is satisfactory. The skin fits well, but that is the only plus. The beltclip broke almost immediately and the armband didn't feel secure."
3,Ok,"I received the product in a reasonable amount of time and such, but I had the clip on my hip for only one day and it broke. The plastic is really cheap. I was very disappointed."
4,medical terminology,This is a great book unfortunately it was the wrong year and I am struggling in my class because of it. Other than that the description was spot on and the price was great.
1,save five bucks....,"i found no information on mena that i didn't find with my search engine. entire ""e-book"" was two pages or so. i really feel i was ripped off."
3,Windows 8 users beware,"M-Audio offers good hardware, great price, and horrendous software. It squeaks by with Windows 7, but 64-bit customers, especially in Vista, get essentially ignored. M-Audio is simply not spending money on writing decent drivers.Also the Audiophile 2496 has a PCI interface, which is just swell. But if you have a new PC, it may not even HAVE a PCI slot on the mainboard. This is tech on the way to obsolescence.For the budget conscious, try a good USB model with low latency, such as ESI U24xl. Good box, good drivers.So, 4 stars for Win XP, none for Win 8."
5,Installs easily and works great with Windows 7,"Having read a number of negative reviews regarding the installation software included with the Audiophile 2496 I went to M-Audio's website and downloaded the drivers for Windows 7 (64 bit) and loaded them before physically installing the card. Once I booted, the card installed and worked perfectly with my Cakewalk pyro Audio Creator that I use to record from vinyl using line and USB input. In fact, the installation was a little too seamless as there was no ""New Hardware Found"" messsage, but I checked System Information and found the device listed with the correct drivers installed. What a relief, as I was not looking forward to contacting M-Audio's support department. I can't say for sure that the sound output is better than that produced by the audio on my motherboard, but it seems to be, and the controls for input and output are far superior to what I had. Overall,very pleased with the product."
3,Excellent Sound Card but No Vista Driver,"When I bought a new pc recently I installed the current driver and popped in the card. I soon discovered that the driver worked only for XP. As of 8/21/07 M-Audio does not have a Vista driver for this card.I used it on my old pc for over a year and loved it. I wanted 24 bit audio and this one is an excellent entry level card for 24 bit.If you're using XP and aren't upgrading or replacing your pc soon, this is a good option. One caveat. The driver may not play well with your video driver."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I installed this card on my Vista box and was surprised the quality wasn't better than the integrated audio. As well, the signal strength was much weaker. I had the most recent drivers installed to no avail.Cheers"
2,Bad Support from M-Audio,"This product is not supported by Windows Vista. BE CAREFUL if you have Windows Vista, you will not be able to install the driver.I request support from M-Audio Web Page from Latin America and Canadian Teams and I have got no answer from any body!"
1,The song remains the same. No Vista drivers available,"This card used to be a nice one. I boght it four years a go (it was $300 then) and drivers used to be updated in a timely manner. Appart for the limited connection options, it did its job.They have been selling a lot since but, despite this fact, M-Audio hasn't been motivated enough to develop Vista drivers (specially those 64 bit ones) They report having started (very late) a beta testing program, where you can sign in but never are given the option to join them actually and get the beta driver, as far as I know. A public release was promised for September, 1st but nothing to do. Delays and more delays with complete lack of transparence.In the end I am leaving on the table this M-Audio 2496 Audiophile besides my Mackie Spike (lacking Vista 64 support as well) I'm now going out for a Focusrite Saffire. I'll let you know..."
3,Past its prime...,"The first thing that should stand out to you is the user manual's setup instructions for Windows 98 users. This was probably a great soundcard back in those days, but it just doesn't measure up today.I bought this card for it's MIDI capabilities, which it performs exceptionally well, but the card is easily overloaded by heavy onscreen graphics resulting in stutters, skips, and pops. When I'm not using this card for MIDI, I have to disable it and use the integrated soundcard that came with my system.This is a decent card for the price if you need MIDI ports, but if you're going to use this for gaming or even watching visualizations with Windows Media Player or Winamp, you should steer clear.For the record, my system specs are:Dell XPS 410Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit2.40GHz Dual Core2 GB RAM"
5,A MUST for amateur home recording from your PC!,"If you are looking to upgrade your soundcard for recording purposes or just for the pure love of your music collection, the 2496 is the product you're looking for. I immediately noticed the enhanced sound compared to the card that came with my computer, and as a home-recording amateur, much appreciated the lines input/outputs for my stereo and midi controller. Installation was a breeze on a system with Windows XP and understanding of the software for the card was simple to grasp after a little fiddling with the levels and a quick glance at the manual."
5,Lives up to its reputation.,"In my search for a decent audio card at a not out-of-reach price I finally chose the Audiophile 2496, for two reasons: glowing internet reviews and excellent manufacturer specs. I am pleased to report that the card lives up to its reputation in every way.The companion mixer software, which controls audio routing, pan, and levels within the chipset, is logically organized and adaptable to various routing schemes or recording setups. Though equipped with a basic full-duplex 2 In 2 Out (unless you also count the SPDIF In/Outs, which can be used simultaneously with the analog for a total of 4 in/4 out) I have not been hampered by lack of additional I/O in any way.I would recommend this audio interface to anyone looking for excellent quality, but limited somewhat by budget. The Audiophile does its job very well and at a very reasonable price."
2,Beware: No more sleep/hibernate on your computer,"They say it's Windows-compatible.A false statement.The ""sleep"" mode is officially not supported, and surprisingly, it really doesn't support. With 20-30% chance, it will output sounds only either left or right channel or both off after waking up. The only way to fix it is to reboot the whole machine and restart all the applications.Their suggestion was: Do NOT sleep or hibernate. (They regard it as a feature, not a bug.)This was my customer service experience and I figured out that I'll get a similar level of customer service from them if I have another problem.I've been consistently using sleep mode for more than 10 years, both in Windows & Linux, which I think is one of the important functions of the OS.You may want to search their forum to learn additional issues before buying to avoid writing this kind of review like me.I have requested Microsoft to remove this product from their compatibility list."
5,Great Hi-Fi card,I installed this card in my computer mainly to receive classical music radio streams from around the world. My computer is connected to my high end stereo system and the sound quality is excellent! Great sound card at a very affordable price.
2,For a 'bible' this is far less than expected!,"If you expect to find some cool effects and ideas for your graphic projects, you will have to look elsewhere. This is just a basic tutorial describing Photoshop Elements menu features, which, of course, anyone can figure out by simply using the program."
1,Lack of info,"Unfortunately, there are no sufficient details as to how many sheets and what is the size. It is a good product that comes in various sizes and packaging. If it's 4"" x 4"" and only 1 piece than is TOO EXPENSIVE!!!! For that money one can find minimum of 3 to 4 pieces elsewhere. 1 star for total lack of detailed information."
3,Later Years of MCA Hits,"This compilation, released by MCA to capitalize on Loveless' catalog of material after she jumped ship to Epic with hubby Emory Gordy, Jr., misses the mark for a ""Greatest Hits"" package. Lots of her best vocal work is missing from her first two MCA CD's: ""Wicked Ways,"" ""Half Over You,"" and a pair of top-drawer Steve Earle-penned gems: ""Some Blue Moons Ago,"" and ""A Little Bit In Love"" were also excluded. (Strange, considering Earle was also an MCA artist at the time.) ""The Night's Too Long,"" which cracked the top 5, is left out. Her big hits are here, but Loveless' impeccable song choices makes it necessary to own all of her early MCA CD's to get a true feel for her scope as an interpretive artist and pioneer of the late 80's/early 90's New Traditionalist movement in Nashville."
2,Getting soapy in space again,"Episode title: MeridianTeleplay by: Mark Gehred O'ConnellStory by: Hilary Bader & Evan Carlos SomersDirected by: Jonathan Frakes""Meridian"" is one of those low-budget-romantic-TV-movie-turned-into-star-trek kind of episodes. We have a plot about a planet that shifts between dimencions, being 60 years at a time in a foreign dimencion and a couple of days in our own.The crew of the Defiant just happen to stumble upon it just as it makes it's once-in-sixty-years shift to our universe, and Jazia Dax just happens to fall suddenly in lovewith one of the natives.We also get a sub plot concerning a rich businesmann visiting DS9 and ending up lusting after Major Kira and ordering a sex programme from Quark featuring our good Major.Even Jonathan Frakes's competent directing or Terry Farrel's talented performance can't do much for this episode, wich is all about a weak plot combined with old fascioned storytelling."
2,Now that was just terrible!,"This episode was a complete flounder. The plot was horrid as was the writing. The dialog made me sick, litarally. This was by far the worst Dax episode. (Except for Rejoined, maybe)"
2,not the best.,I found this book on stout to not be as good as the chapter on stout in designing great beers. This is probably the worst in the series. If you are getting all the books in the series you may as well get this one otherwise save yourself some time and just get designing great beers. My biggest complaints.a. Completly dismissive of the Oatmeal Stout style saying it's just a sweet stout plus marketing.b. Treats imperial stout as just a stronger version of standard stout.c. Doesn't ever define stout.d. no recipies for milk stout or oatmeal stout(see a).e. Refuses to accept porter as a different style.f. Lot's of downright incorrect information.
1,This Book is Not for Home Brewers,"Other than the historical information passed to the reader, Dr Lewis concentrated on the biochemistry of Stout Ale. His use of Principle Components Analysis was way over the top and quite useless to the hobbiest. Why would the editors allow him to publish the tast profiles using such an advanced yet esoteric statistical tool is a mystery. The home brewer will find little practical information in this treatise, and should avoid it altogether."
2,Stick to Bernstein's Original Recording,"Having been a huge fan of Mass since I first heard Bernstein's recording when I was in college in the late 80s, I was really excited to see a new recording. While some of the ensemble playing and singing on this recording is technically better it is almost entirely without any kind of soul or emotion. Hadley is okay altough I prefer Alan Titus in the original recording. The real tragedy of this recording is the quality of the many soloists sprinkled throughout the work. They sound like trained choral singers trying to be broadway stars and the effect is awful. Although I don't know this for a fact, after hearing this recording I am convinced that the original recording must have used actual broadway singers/actors--normally not my cup of tea, but far superior to any of the soloists on the Nagano recording. There are also issues with the placement of the various ensembles and balances are disappointing both in terms of sound quality and dramatic tension."
2,uninspired and disappointing,"Having cut my musical eye-teeth on the original cast recording of the Mass, I was so excited to see an updated version of this highly influential theatre work. Unfortunatley, my hopes were dashed by a recording that suffers both artistically and technically. Perhaps it is because Alan Titus' voice is so stuck in my head, but the selection of vocalists shows a refinement that cheapens the performance. The raw quality of Bernstein's statement has been tamed, and the result is flat and lacking in emotion.This recording also has some fascinating technical issues. On many occasions voices are buried by the orchestra. Soloists come and go with remarkable inconsistency. The recording is muddy in places, and compared to the original cast project leaves much to be desired.Everyone should own a copy of the Mass, but they should do themselves the favor of buying the original rather than this lukewarm copy."
5,Twilley Does It Again,"This recording, like all of Dwight Twilley's past recordings, is full of power pop gems. There are artists and bands (i.e. the Del Lords, the Michael Stanley Band, Michael Stanley solo, and Dwight Twilley) who for some reason are not given the commercial recognition that artists of lesser talent are given. Dwight Twilley has from his first recording with the Dwight Twilley Band to this recording produced some of the very best music of the past fifty years. All of the songs here have the familiar hooks that Dwight Twilley is know for. The ones that grabbed my attention immediately were ""Music"", ""Forget About It"", ""The Luck"", ""Suzyanne"", and the great ""Gave It All Up For Rock n' Roll"". Please do yourself a favor and buy, beg, borrow, or steal this power pop masterpiece."
5,"Cuba: A Travelers Literary Companion (Traveler's Literary Companion,8",The item came within the required time. I would recommend it to anyone who plans to visit Cuba anytime soon
3,Muslim Arabia 1970,"(From another review): 144 pages with mostly black and white photos, with a few colored ones. Chapters are: The Traditional Life Style of Islam; Moslem Institutions; The Moslem Religion; The Sources of Arab Learning; Language, Thought and Literature; Mathematics and Astronomy; Geographical Knowledge; The Great Trade Routes; Science and Its Applications; The Arabs and Medicine; Architecture and the Arts; The Arabs' Civilizing Influence on Europe."
3,"Good, but ...","The book presented a nice ovrview of the air war. I appreciated the fact it didn't focus on the aces and the fiew big air battles. But ist just seemed to lack depth. I think the author had the material to make an excellent book. I think it needed to be fleshed out a lilttle more. I missed the details of the planes themselves and the technological development that went on. As well as the evolution of the tactics developed by the differant combatants. I guess I was expection a ""Castles of Steel"" for the air war. It was well written and an excellent overview of the subject and I would recommend it for anyone wanting to get a good introduction to the subject."
5,Fantastic!,"A great game that was in great condition, and for a great price! It was delivered quickly and met my standards across the board."
4,What You Won't Do For Love of Latinum,"This episode is a real trip! When the Nagus comes from the wormhole with an Orb of the Prophets, that's not all he came back with. The Nagus proceeds to rewrite the Rules of Acquisition to promote a kinder, gentler way of acquiring profit; or in this case, how to give it away!When the Nagus decides to bestow his new found knowledge to the ever-greedy Quark, he nearly hits the floor in shock (literally!)when he reads the first new rule of acquisition, he knows something is wrong: If they want their money back, give it to them.Well, Quark does some investigating and finds that the Nagus went to the Gamma Quadrant and when he came back, the Prophets transformed him from the almighty greed to giving to those in need.Seeing the end of the world is imminent, Quark decides to take a chance that will either bring back his Nagus, or turn Ferengi commerce into a cesspool of softies."
3,The toddler bed,This item looks nice but the way the holes to put the bed together didn't line up with the other parts of the pieces and we were unable to put the bottom draw on and my husband had to put the bed up against the wall so my daughter doesn't fall from out of the bed.
4,Beautiful and well made toddler bed,"This toddler bed is a great transition for my 15 month old daughter who was scared of the crib. She likes it, and it is safer than a regular bed. The bed is low to the ground and is very well made. The only negative thing I have to say is that the safey rails are not as they show in the picture. Once you put a mattress on it the rails only come up about 3 to 4 inches. However, it still does the job! We are happy to finally have a safe place for our daughter to sleep."
2,Would not Recommend this Bed,"I've had this bed now for about 9 mos. It is a beautiful looking bed and the price is great. However, the drawer is already not functional, it was hard for my husband to put together and the support slats for the matress are flimsy. Two have already broken. I have a younger daughter that I was planning on handing this down to but will not be able to. If you only have one child that will be using the bed for a short time it is a good deal. Otherwise, I would spend a little more money for a higher quality bed."
5,So adorable! : ),"This bed is so adorable - our three year old LOVES it! : ) We had purchased it early for her birthday and therefore didn't set it up until well after the posted return date (our fault). We had a couple of scratches in a piece and emailed the company & even though it was past the date, they quickly sent us a replacement piece without any problem!So excellent customer service and a very solid bed with a handy storage drawer for linens & such! : )"
5,"best action game on the gba , period!","Seriously,i bought this game yesterday and i have to say is the best gba action game next to the metroid and castlevania series.The action is fast ,fluid and the graphics...nothing short of amazing.it really pushes the limits of the gba hardware.The game is a side scrolling shooter like contra and metal slug, but waaaay better.Not just that ,there are two different characters to choose from and the outcome of the game depends on who you finished it with. There are also some shooter levels of the likes of 1942 and aero fighters between levels so stages feel fresh ,you are not just running and gunning all the time.bottom line is if you like action and own a gba GO AND BUY IT NOW! i give you my word.you wont be dissapointed."
2,c-block,the CD that I want is called c-block I like this album so I thought I buy this there are some good sungs that I like one of them is called (time is taking away)the seckend one is is called (so stroung out)and the third one is (a sommertime)
4,the airline before Air America,"The CIA's Air America became famous for its feats in Southeast Asia. This is the story of how Air America began, as a private-venture airline in China headed by Claire Chennault of the Flying Tigers. Leary tells the story of how CAT morphed into a para-military force, supporting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops in their losing battle with the Communists, and eventually retreating with them to Taiwan. There it began to take on odd jobs for the U.S. military, and eventually the CIA bought a piece of it, so that CAT pilots were one day flying supplies to U.S. forces in Korea, again providing the same service for French troops in Vietnam, and between times dropping spies into China. It's a great yarn, though told with professorial precision. A reprint (no changes) of an earlier book from a university press."
2,not very sharp,"not very sharp in my opinion. in fact, its sitting in my desk drawer as a letter opener. but, i guess, you get what you pay for... Also, the blade has these little teeth on it, so you cant really even sharpen it."
4,Love this brush,"I was hesitant to spend this kind of money on a hairbrush, but my hairstylist uses them and loves them and whenever she does my hair, it looks amazing. I went for the blonde brush because I have fine hair and it's working great. Glides through the hair, makes blowdrying easier and faster and my hair is soft and shiny. Worth the money for sure. I will be buying these as gifts for Christmas for my sister and mom as well."
2,I'm going back to old phone! Terrible connections!,So I thought it would be good to trade-up from my old motorolla. Now I'm going back. Who needs a camera and video and color when you can't talk to anyone????
1,You can't hear me now....,"This phone puts Verizon's entire ad campaign at risk of being a lie. The reception is so awful on this phone that I am considering returning to Nextel/Sprint and paying the early termination fee to get away from Verizon. No matter where I am, and no matter how many bars the phone says I have, conversations are garbled, words get dropped, and everyone is frustrated. Shame on Verizon for permitting such a piece of junk in its lineup."
1,phone is total garbage,"I'm not going to even discuss any of the phone's features, camera, etc. No need....regardless of any of the nice features of today's cell phones, the main idea is still to make a phone call that sounds good. And this phone frankly sounds horrible. My girlfriend bought it with a service plan from Amazon and we could not be more disappointed. With plenty of bars, the phone makes conversations very hard to hear, dropped words, static, scratches, etc. I've seen lots of people say the same thing. STAY FAR AWAY from this phone. Now my girlfriend and I have the contract and a phone that needs to go back (with the ported number she needs to keep) so now we have to worry about cancelling the plan, keeping the number, and being eligible to get another phone at a good price and recognized as a ""new"" activation again. To sum it all up, worst phone I've ever used."
1,TERRIBLE PHONE TERRIBLE MANUFACTURER,"I have had this phone for less than two months. Up and until last week it was a very enjoyable experience--Despit there being no pre-loaded games. And then, a few days ago, the right hinge cracked, and then the entire phone began to fall apart. Samsung is AWARE of this problem, as well as the repair shops that fix Samsung phones, yet this issue is NOT covered in the warranty--What is a warranty for then??? DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. If you do, BEWARE. You have been warned."
3,"Nice Phone, Bad Casing","M. Lolich has experienced the same delimma. Two weeks after the warranty expired the right hinge casing broke off, followed shortly by the left and the screen no longer functions. Naturally, to fix the problem I would pay over $130.00--that's just an estimate. If you buy this phone be VERY careful when opening and closing, don't lean on it with your ear to your shoulder, and keep checking under any protective covering so you catch the break before the warranty expires. Otherwise, it's not a bad phone."
2,Hot Phone~,"If you want to buy a cell phone, keep away from it. It is really hot. Hot? Yes, so hot to burn your cheek after 5 minutes use. That is why this baby only have 2 days standby time at most. My last nokia need to be charged only once a week if I did not call too much. But this one, I have to charge it almost every day. Also the signal is not as good as my old nokia. I had thought sumsung can produce good cell phone. But the A670 dispoint me, as unreliable as Motorola. Maybe next time I should try LG or Siemens."
4,This phone is pretty cool!,"I like the camera and video camera. I also like the Get It Now feature, where you can download ringtones and games. It also has a planner and voice recorder. It even has text messaging and you can check your e-mail and log onto the internet.It has voice recognition so u can dial hands-free. I like this phone and plan to keep it for the rest of the plan. I am a teen and this phone rocks!"
1,Stupid phone made by stupid company,You can use this phone to cook eggs but never try to talk to someone over it. There is no support from the company. Never buy any Samsung product.
1,Poor Voice Quality,The voice quality of this phone is extremely poor. I can't believe Samsung still make this kind of crappy product. Shame of you Samsung! I will never buy any Samsung product.
1,Phone's Audio died after less than 2 years,"Verizon's attititude was ""tough <fertilizer>! Renew and buy a new phone.""When it worked, this phone had the absurd habit of taking photos of my wife's purse; it would bump up against something which would activate the camera.So caveat emptor.dave"
3,My Kewl Phone!,"This phone was good but, the camera is not great, when i first got the phone the camera was great but when i got a cover for the phone the camera was not good, the camera still works but not very well, the phone really keeps you organized but my main issue is that there are never ringtones avialabe for this phone. :("
1,This phone really sucks!,ok 2 words... low battery... the battery life on this phone is so bad that once it only lasted like 3 hours on my phone... the camera and games are the things that kill it... the only thing that u can probably do without the battery dying is use the phone to call people.. and plus this phone is considered wet even if it rains or one time i went swimming and i set this phone like about 20 feet away from the pool on a chair... it gets slightly wet like 3 drops of water and it doesnt work for at least a day. there are so many other better phones that verizon has to offer and around the same price zone. im so glad i accidentally broke this phone... my advice... try the new motorola e815... its like so high tech and amazing that it even amazes my friends... it has a button for everything... youd be better off
1,Avoid this phone (and possibly Samsung),"-- terrible voice quality-- ridiculously low battery life-- phone becomes hot (yes, hot) after 5-10 mins use-- can't remember if this phone ever finished a long (>10min) call without dropping signal.-- one of our phones stopped working after 4 months of use. Verizon salesperson says this is due to ""poor handling"" on our part. How do you handle a cell phone poorly? We had to buy another phone.Frankly this is my first experience with a ""picture"" phone, not sure if all picture phones are this bad. So I am not in a position to compare. My last Nokia with AT&T; lasted 3 years without dropping a call, and Verizon signal strength is supposed to be superior to AT&T; at least in the San Francisco Bay Area. My friends say Samsung clam shell model phones are best avoided, in general, i.e. unless you think screen saver is the most useful feature in a cell phone."
4,Berry Happy Home,"This is a great toy...my daughter loves strawberry shortcake...however, we would like to purchase the additions to the Berry Happy Home and cannot find them anywhere. There should be 3 additions to this toy. Any suggestions to where we can find these.Thanks you."
3,Ok - if you can find the dolls.,"This toy was ok but it doesn't smell like strawberries. It has no dolls and it is made for the little 3-4 inch ones. The windowboxes do not pop one and stay. They should have been attached at the factory. Cute, but my daughter just uses regular kelly size dolls in it."
2,uhmm not well designed,Some of the attachment pieces (the flower boxes and the mailbox?) wouldn't connect worth a flip.I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It is cute...and my daughter is young enough to not care about the engineering deficiencies. The stickers and the concave surface are a bit of a problem. Perhaps less stickers...and more furniture.Unit also does not come with any figures...my little girl spent 10 minutes looking for figures in the box...and under the tree. How sad it that?
3,Disappointed in lack of quality and information,"My daughter received this gift for her 2nd birthday and was absolutely delighted- mom and dad, however, were not since the set came without dolls (nothing disclosed this on the box) and then trying to put the flower boxes in was deemed impossible! They do not clip on as they are supposed to and it would appear it was just ""tooled"" incorrectly. Same holds true with the little strawberry flower that goes on the side. In addition to this, the door does not clamp shut.Needless to say we were very disappointed with the quality of this product and as cute as it is, would not recommend it. I am currently in search of the dolls that go to this toy. Wish me luck!"
2,Where are the dolls????,My 3 year old got this for a Christmas present. She chose to play with it for the first time on a night she had a babysitter. Not only were there no directions but she was extremely disappointed to find no dolls. We have been in search of them for 3 weeks now and cannot seem to find dolls anywhere.
2,nice house but can't find dolls,"My daughter rec'd this for her birthday prior to Christmas. I have been hunting ever since to find any doll that goes with it. I was told the 5.5"" ones are the correct size. However, no one has them or the furniture. I have looked at our 3 Toys R Us, and the Walmarts, Kmarts and Targets but no one has them. I am not sure who to be upset with - the aunt who gave it to her or the stores for not stocking the items that go with it. I would love to have at least one doll for it. Any ideas on where to find them?!"
4,MomtoSydneyandLeo,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Chanukah this year and she loves it -- plays with it everyday, which is more than I can say for most of her toys. I had no problem finding the furniture -- [...] I've had no trouble with the window boxes -- they're hard to get on the first time and there is a left and right to them, but once I got them popped on, they haven't fallen off. If you lay the house on it's side to fill it, it fits all three rooms of furniture plus a couple dolls. As for the stickers, I just decided to forgo using most of them -- they aren't really necessary, especially if you have the furniture. My only complaint is that I don't know why two sets of furniture came with a strawberry shortcake -- I actually would rather they left the dolls out and knocked a few dollars off the price."
4,It's nice,"My daughter had been asking for Strawberry shortcake house non-stop for Christmas so we got it for her. She loves it!! Though I do agree with the others about the stickers, and the window boxes, but she doesn't seem to mind so whatever as long as she is happy. Now finding the furniture was hard to find. I ended up only buying the bedroom set on ebay for 23. But the other two were just to high in price. I would love to get her the other furniture sets but have been unable to find them."
3,Ummmmm....a bit disappointed,Got this for my 3yr old this year for X Mas - broke my neck trying to find the other parts that come with it and needless to say I didn't. I was disappointed that a doll did not come with it - I mean at least Strawberry Shortcake herself should be included - but she wasn't and from reading the past reviews I don't think I'll find her - but my daugher has been using the dolls from Polly Pocket to play with the house - along with some of the other furniture from other toys - it has also become Dora's home away from home - but it would be nice to have Strawberry Shortcake herself live there.
2,Not worth the money,"I recently purchased the SSC scented home and I'm glad I got it on sale. It's not scented, the one window box is not only hard to put on, but it doesn't stay on. Let's not even talk about the stickers, they show through because the house is a see-through red and they're hard to put on. There's hardly any furniture and I hear the other sets that are sold seperately are VERY hard to find. Of course they show these sets on the outside of the box, so you know what you're missing. Overall,(...)"
3,I'm a bit ambivalent...,"Purchased this for my three year old's birthday. The items that come with it are okay, although the packaging is very misleading (have to look at small print to see it doesn't come with furniture shown on box).It is a decent size, and you can toss a lot of SSC stuff in there and close it up... BUT... the stickers that come with it are hard to put on correctly, the sides are concave (it is a strawberry after all!) and getting the stickers on without puckering is problematic. Also, since the toy is not opaque, the stickers show through from the inside to the outside. Not attractive at all.It is cute, and my daughter loves it. (...)"
3,ads a bit misleading,"Though my 3 1/2 year old loves playing with the strawberry house, we were both disappointed when we first received it. It comes with very little furniture, only a chair, table, tv, closet, and clock. Additional furniture pieces are, at this point, impossible to find. Plus, they advertise that you can close it up and take it anywhere. Well, there is very little room inside. By the time you put the furniture it comes with inside and the doll you have a hard time closing it up. If you want to take it somewhere and have additional furniture or dolls plan on taking a bag along. It is adorable, but felt we should have gotten more for the money."
2,I agree,"I have to completely agree. I was also dissapointed when I opened the house. I didn't notice any scent at all and it didnt have the furniture I wanted. The Berry Happy Home comes with a table, etc and a bed. This doesn't. I have looked everywhere online to find the additional furniture and they are nowhere. I even contacted the maker, Bandai. Their response was the toys r us carried it....and they don't. I recommend the Strawberry Shortcake:Berry Happy Home....not this scented one."
2,save your time and money,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old who loves strawberry shortcake. In order for her to play with it I had to search everywhere to find extra dolls with an average price of 10.00 per doll. I still have not been able to find accessories for it. I opened the box and there was no ""strawberry"" smell at all as advertised on the box. My daughter was so excited at first but got bored after the first 1/2 hour because she had nothing to play with except the few pieces that came with the kit. By the time you hunt down what few products there are to go with this house, not to mention the ridiculis price you pay for them, its not worth the time, money or effort. She uses her Dora the explorer doll and the Dora house accessories to play with it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU PAY, highly recommend the Sweet Street set ( alot of bang for your buck). We bought that to replace the strawberry house and she plays with it non stop."
1,USELESS PIECE OF JUNK,"This toy could be great...if any of the advertised accessories were sold. In order to get a doll for the Home, you must bid ridiculously high on E Bay. There are accessories listed as being sold on the back of the box. This is FALSE. These accessories are no longer sold anywhere, including E Bay. Banai, the manufacturer of this piece, does not answer their phone, nor do they answer their e-mails. Yes, you may be getting a good deal on this, but it is still a high price for a piece of useless plastic junk."
3,"Nice House but unfortunately, not played with",My daughter and I like Strawberry Shortcake stuff. I thought she would like the house too but she barely plays with it. She prefers the Strawberry Shortcake books and movies. She is not a dollhouse girl.
4,Imagination Builder!,"I bought the Strawberry Shortcake Strawberry Scented Home for my two little girls, 5 & 3. They have a couple of strawberry shortcake dolls that play in it and they sometimes invite Barbie over to play too. I also bought the Strawberry Shortcake Filly Grooming Stable w/Honey Pie Pony. We put the two sets next to each other and the girls have a great time. Its good to see kids actually using their imagination."
2,Not impressed; 3 1/2 year old doesn't seem to be either,"Though I knew this item didn't come with all the stuff shown on the box, I didn't realize the other stuff would be impossible to find. I even shopped early (Oct.) for Christmas and never saw the not-included furniture items in Target, Walmart or Toys R Us. There are no instuctions on where to put the stickers and I couldn't get them on without them puckering due to the stawberry contour; the flowerboxes pop off too; so far, the latch does stay closed. My daugher doesn't really play with it, she keeps asking for Strawberry Shortcake's bed! None of the items are currently on the manufacturer's website either so I don't know what that means. I definately feel this item was overpriced even at $25."
2,Another Disappointment,"Like everything else Strawberry Shortcake. Listed as scented and NO SMELL. My Strawberry Shortcake Dolls from 25 years ago have a stronger smell now than the new ones today. I can't get the Strawberry to attach outside; Not enough room for it to attach. Don't care for the sticker furniture. How about REAL furniture. My biggest complaint is you can't find the accesories. My daughter seems to enjoy it, now strawberry ""lives"" next door to barbie. I guess that is all that matters. Save your money and wait for a larger version. Maybe they'll come out with a two story like 25 years ago:)"
1,Not worth buying....,"This toy is SUCH a disappointment & waste of money. The accessories (what there are of them) do not even fit in the house, and the window boxes, etc. do not stay put. [...]"
4,Sort of a weird toy,"My daughter likes this house so i am keeping it but unlike most of the reviewers, we have all 3 furniture sets and I wish I hadn't bought them because none of it really fits well in the house. You can only put one room in at a time. Also, if you do buy the furniture sets, you will end up with 2 strawberry shortcake dolls and 1 angel cake doll because the dolls come with the sets. Instead of a set of furniture for each character. I paid 17.99 for them at the Toys R us in Times Square in Manhattan which put the cost of the house up to almost 90.00 with everything and all for a house where the furnture doesn't even fit."
4,Marie,This was bought for my grand daughter. She really liked it and plays with it often. it is really cute and goes cute with the dolls. Simple but fun.Marie
5,GO-GO GIRL ROCKS!,"This is a fabulous collection of cool, light-hearted rock songs by the Go-Go's lead singer Belinda Carlisle. She is one of my all-time favorite female artists. Her sexy vocal style is showcased in this collection of 13 songs from 1986 to '92. Hits ""Circle In The Sand"", ""I Get Weak"", ""Mad About You"", and the smash #1 hit from 1987 ""Heaven Is A Place On Earth"". Also a very under-rated song, ""Leave A Light On"" is included as well. This music brings back some great memories of the good ol' days back in the 80's when music was still great, as well as fun to listen to. If you're a fan of Belinda, or the Go-Go's, then you should already have this one. Two words: ROCK ON!"
5,Belinda rocks!,"What can I say that won't be obvious when you listen to Belinda sing? I was prompted to buy this CD right after going to the Regeneration Concert. Shes still got it, awesome vocals and high energy. Get a copy today and listen to it at home or on the road in your car. Great 80s stuff, add it to your collection!"
5,Great Singer,I have loved Belinda Carlisle singing every since she was with the GoGo's. I think she has a lovely voice and her music is great. When I saw this disk on Amazon I ordered it. I can't say which song is my favorite because I like so many of them.
3,"It's almost perfect, but leaves a GLARING OMISSION ...","This is the perfect, ""Oh, joy! It's springtime!"" music. Belinda's songs can make you feel exuberant glee, or make you sad and reminiscent. I've loved her since my older brother turned me on to the Go-Go's back in '82.I gotta go harsh, though, with the three stars, because despite how great these tunes are, the record company slyly left out ""Runaway Horses"", one of her most uplifting songs (IMHO). The reason, of course, is to make you buy the Runaway Horses album to get ahold of that song.All I have to say is that, ""Belinda, if your label ever does release a box set, could you have 'em put that song in it?"" Other than that sad loss, it's a fine batch o' tunes, and you can find it for a steal these days."
3,Belinda Is So Linda!,"Great compilation, back to 80's again, this woman was part of the most beautiful era for music, recomended!"
5,one of the best greatest hits albums out there,"You just might not find a better greatest hits cd than this. All the songs are her biggest and most explosive hits. Belinda has a voice that just sticks in your head all day. Especially when you hear tunes like ""Summer Rain"",which could possibly be the best tune on the album. Her style of music is so powerful and yet rather romantic in a way. If you like Celine Dion then I'm positive you'll love Belinda!"
1,About as left as you can get,"Under the liberal heading, he quotes liberals saying nice things about liberalism, and under the conservative heading he quotes liberals saying not so nice things about conservatism. You can imagine the rest. The Book of political Quotes by Jonathon Green is a much more balanced one"
1,Only good for one year,Don't plan on using them more than one year. I have 5 acres and everything is on battery irrigation clocks. Three years ago I bought this system at Costco. Great price and it worked like a charm for ONE season. Each year I've had to replace all four valves despite cleaning them out thoroughly at the end of the season.If you want something really reliable buy a Gardena or Claber. I've had these for four years now and they keep on keeping on without a hitch. They won't break if you have high water pressure and they work wonderfully on drip systems. Set up is easy on them - the controller comes off so you can take it in the house for security reasons or just to replace the battery or change the timing - and even if you leave the door open it still keeps working. A word of caution though. When using anything digital keep it out the sun. I put a $5 storage container from Walmart over them with a few holes cut out on the side for ventilation.
3,4 Watering Stations - Not Quite,"The instructions are hard to follow (especially figuring out which buttons they're referring to on the unit), although read it about 5 times and you'll figure it out. My biggest complaint is that I expected four independent watering programs, one for each of the stations that you can program. Not the case. The only thing that you can vary among the four stations is the duration of the watering time. But if you want a station to go on, it goes on with all the others at the same time. For example, if you want one station to water once a day, and the second station to water every third day, you're out of luck. I called customer service and they confirmed this. Pretty stupid design."
1,Piece of junk!,If you forget to put the cover back on the next time it rains this controller will be ruined!
4,Good for starters....,"With this price, it must be the best option for starters. The packed mouthpiece and ligature is awful so you should definitely buy a better mouthpiece and ligature."
3,"Solid, yes, but....","This live cd from arguably the most talented and versatile reggae bands showcases much of their skill, however there is a large amount of rap influences and dancehallish stylee in the mix, so roots reggae buyers beware. Without their original bassist and guitarist, Pulse by the late eighties-I feel -suffered a serious blow to their sound. Definitely a purchase for converted fans, but newbies should look their earlier work to see what all the fuss is about. Irie I."
5,Aweson,"Quality music and Great sound! This is the first album that I purchase online to keep it and used with my phone and I have to said,,,, I love it"
1,It might be an upgrade version!,"Be careful when you buy this product, it might be the upgrade version. I just brought a used one with the key, hoping to install it in my computer. When I ran the installation, it searched for an older version of QuickBooks, which I didn't have. A message came up stating that this software is only an upgrade for the older version and the setup was canceled."
4,A masterful weaving of multi-story threads,"Zoran Zivkovic is a writer of astonishing talent. After having read his superb ""Library"" novellas in the VanderMeer/Aguirre-edited ""Leviathan 3"" anthology, I was eagerly awaiting this release from NightShade. And I was not disappointed.I won't attempt to give a plot synopsis here, especially as plot, per se, is not the salient feature of The Fourth Circle. What is prominent is Zivkovic's mastery of the multiple character perspective, i.e., the manner in which he develops his characters (there are many) and gives each a distinctive voice. That, and the way he wraps the varied story threads into a finally cohesive, yet mysterious whole.The narrative, however, kept me at a slight remove from total involvement in the story, which leads me to give it four stars rather than five. Quality fiction, regardless."
3,Good story short on appliable info,Joe John Duran's book is an interesting insight into the growing and selling of a business. The book catalogues his personal experiences along with the experiences of various business owners he interviewed. African fables for the introductory theme of each chapter is a nice touch. Some of the more useful information about building an efficient 'turn-key' business is the focus of Michael Gerber's The E-Myth.
4,Classic Lugosi,"I think this is a great example of Lugosi's work both in good films and bad. I was a little disappointed as this collection does not include ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla"", with the infamous Martin-Lewis impersonators. It actually has a different flick by the name of ""The Gorilla"", made in 1939 and features the Ritz Brothers. Great restoration, a few classic interviews, a must for Lugosi fans."
2,"Decent game, though highly overrated. And doesn't deserve the title Resident Evil","Resident Evil 4 is a decent game, really. But it shouldn't have been labeled and marketed as a Resident Evil game. The only connections to the Resident Evil plotline are a few references that seem forced. It also lacks the two things that make a game feel like a Resident Evil game, tension and exploration."
3,arcade style resident evil,"this is a decent game but it's like playing an arcade style of resident evil.The graphics are second to none and it does have some cool game play but it's not a typical resident evil game,basically just kill everything that moves,not much thinking involved.This game will keep u entertained for a few hours ,but killing everything gets boring fast,save your money and rent it first."
3,"a ""5"" if you want a shooting game, 3 if you want RE","The game is fun, but it is not the old survival horror game. Don't expect a licker to come crashing through the windows as youre trying to limp along and find some medicine. You stay at a distance, shoot til you can't shoot no more. There are few puzzles and little need to look for evidence or clues... just keep shooting and moving forward.As far as the new ground breaking controlls... if youve played legend of zelda on an old N64, imagine that with a RE setting and improved graphics. When you kill the bad guys they disappear and leave behind ammo, piles of money and so forth (like the typical fantasy game). ""Oh I killed the monster... wait, heres a glowing pile of cash and an ammo clip, of course.""Overall though, still fun."
5,Great and intense game!,"I think this game is the best so far in the series. Great new enemies, great AI for enemies and your little sidekick you obtaine in the middle of the game. Visuals are wonderful and nicely done. And the suspense is awesome!! Never a dull moment, even through cut scenes.Leon is my favorite character, so this game was a dream come truwe. Highly recommmend!Just need the novel by S D Perry to go with it and I will be a happy camper."
4,Pretty cool game,"I don't have this game for game cube, but i have it for Wii(i mean it's the same stinkin game, right?)Now overall this game has the best graphics and a brilliant plot line.But the only thing that tics me off is that the evil characters repetitively talk nonstop every time they see you,when they're chasing you,or when you shoot them they go,""OOF!OOF!AH!AH!OHHHHHHHHH.""It's kind of cheesy if you ask me.But sometimes it's funny,like say when you push them off the ladders they go,""AAAAAAAA!WAAAAAAAAA!EEEEEEEEEEEEE!""(lol:)So buy this game.It's cool,but especially because it's fun!"
5,"One of the BEST, if not THE BEST game on the Gamecube!!","Great story, superior gameplay, and not stop action (the pacing is perfect). The graphics are wonderful... especially for the Gamecube. Everything just feels right. Capcom definitely got it right with this one... it is COMPLETELY different from all other Resident Evil games. This game is a MUST OWN!"
5,Resident Evil 4,A very intense game with great graphics and story. Lots of action and very fun to play. Long game play makes this game worth the money.
5,"Move aside Half-Life 2, Resident Evil 4 here","This game is way better then Halo 2, Half-Life 2, and MGS 3. If this was released a month earlier, it would have won the Game of the Year award. I've never played Resident Evil, but since I know the whole story, I don't need to. The story of Resident Evil 4 is a bit more different. Leon S. Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) is sent to Europe to find the President's daughter. Soon, Leon finds out that there's more to the villagers and the Village Chief then what meets the 'eye'. Greatest game ever. (...)"
5,Anyone will love this game,"Resident Evil 4 is a good time! You have unlimited saves,cool weapons, best graphics,(On a nintendo system)ingenious boss battles,full 3RD person view, scary as hell. I would vote this game of the year. If you have a cube, buy RE4, if you dont have a cube, get the PS2 version. It might be good.You dont need to like games or the franchise to like RE4.i give RE4 a 5 out of 5."
5,Brilliant,"Just when I was loosing faith in my Gamecube, Resident Evil 4 came and saved the day. Awesome graphics make this game way way creepy, and the zombies running around yelling mierda (Spanish for sh*t), makes this game awesome. Its way fun to play over and over, just runnung around and blowing zombies up. This game is incredible and you need to stop what your doing right now and go buy it!!"
5,Amazing....,"The game is amazing. Period. This game is the best game i have ever played. And if you dont have a lot of time to play a game, make time for this game. It will blow your socks off. Never before has gameplay seem so real to me. It was like the whole time, you were trailing right behind Leon on his pursuit to save the president Daughter.The game is really solid. There is no loading time, and you can just keep playing, and playing, and playing, and you get the idea. The only bad part of the game is trying to find a time to play this. It's really time consuming. Make sure you are going to have time for it becaause you are going to want to try and beat it in one sitting, but u just cant unless you know what you are doing. But anyways, I strongly urge everyone to try this game, but make sure you have the time."
2,It's not that great,"This game is not as godly as everyone claims. You get a few different weapons (but the only ones you get to use often are the shotgun and pistol) and you kill the same enemies over and over and over. When I hear 'Resident Evil 4' I think of one thing and that is monotonous.The Resident Evil series usually has complicated puzzles to unlock the next door or figure things out and what-not, but not so much in this game. In this one you just shoot these hillbilly Satanist dudes and run to the next part.The bosses are kind of so-so. The chainsaw sisters were pretty fun but everyone else I just did the shoot and run tactic.The only reason I gave it two stars was because the graphics are amazing. They're just wasted on this game."
2,A Serious Flaw,"Let me begin by saying I am a long time fan of the Resident Evil series of games. RE4 is the best of them so far and in its balance of elements, sets a new standard by which other video games should be judged.Having said this the game contains TWO flaws, one minor and one major. The minor flaw is the control setup, especially the onscreen control prompts, that requires some getting used to.The second flaw is the final action escape scene. This scene has been made so difficult and so frustrating that even after satisfactory completion there is no sense of satisfaction.This is truly a remarkable game design flaw and I'm surprised that the manufacturer let it through.I have played this game through once and have almost completed a second game from the ""original"" beginning. This game will obviously give hours of pleasant entertainment and it deserves to be strongly recommended to gamers.This is a first rate game with a third rate ending."
3,"Great game, but .......","I think this is an excellent game, but you should wait for the Playstation 2 release in late 2005. Chances are good that the later release on PS2 will be packed with bonus material ala ""RE: Code Veronica X."" That is why I'm giving this version 3 stars --- yeah it's great, but I think all RE fans should be informed of this development. Think about it before making a purchase you might regret later."
1,MAKES YOU DIZZY AND SICK PLAYING IT,THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE AFTER JUST 5 MINS PLAYING IT I HAD TO STOP CAUSE IT MADE ME FEEL SICK AND DIZZY FROM THE GAME PLAY.EVEN MY GF WHO WAS WATCHING ME PLAY IT GOT SICK AND DIZZY FROM JUST WATCHING THE SCREEN.THE OTHER RESIDENT EVIL GAMES ARE JUST FINE I PLAYED THEM FOR HOURS AND NEVER HAD ONCE GOT DIZZY OR FELT SICK FROM THEM.BUT THIS ONE IS LIKE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE PLAYED MEDAL OF HONOR YOU KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT.IT MAKES YOU SICK AND DIZZY PLAYING IT.DON'T KNOW WHY THE MAKERS OF THIS GAME COULDN'T KEEP IT LIKE THE NEW AND IMPROVED RESIDENT EVIL FOR GAMECUBE.THE FACT THAT THIS GAMES MOVEMENT MAKES YOU SICK AND DIZZY MAKES THIS UNPLAYABLE AND THAT IS A MAJOR FLAW.
5,Excellent,"great game, not to be missed for anyone who is a fan of survival horror games. Great replay value, well worth the $12 I spent on it."
5,Great condition,"Game was received perfectly as if it was the first day of launch. Great condition and the game works perfectly as it should. Finally was able to finish my collection of the games with this, thanks. =D"
5,Game of the Year for 2005,"One of the most anticipated games ever to hit the cube is Resident Evil 4. It took me 44 hours to beat it the first time. it was my first resident evil game and i am impressed. the gameplay was phenomenal, and the gore was enough to make it realistic without being excessive. The Game is incredibly difficult and offers a challenge to anyone, but be warned, you'll need a stomach of iron to make it through this game alive."
4,Resident Evil 4,"I have to admit, I hate horror games. But this is game is different. First of all it's not a first person and its really not a third person. You have an over the shoulder view which really suits the game well. You are right in the action. People are coming at you right and left but you feel kind of helpless(especially with low ammo). It does not hurt that the graphics are gorgeous either. Another plus for the game is that the buttons could be mapped any better. This is one of the few games that I'm completely happy with the way the buttons are mapped. I also like how you can upgrade your weapons. Last but not least, I enjoy how the background music changes once someone start walking towards you.My only complaint with the game is that the hit detection is kinda off. Sometimes I find myself shooting someone in the head but don't die. They don't even slow down! That doesn't happen much but when ammo is scarce, it hurts."
5,Exciting and good looking single player game.,"After reading the great reviews of this game I went out and bought a Gamecube just to play it and I'm glad I did. After finishing Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox, I have been searching for the next great game. I tried Doom 3 on my PC, but was unsatisfied. I also tried various Xbox games, but none were as good as Ninja Gaiden. Well I can honestly say that this game is as much fun, if not more, than Ninja Gaiden. The graphics are not quite as good as Ninja Gaiden on my 94"" diagonal projection system, but I am trying to get the Gamecube component cables to improve the picture quality. Gameplay is good. The contols are well designed and the game is not too hard and not too easy. Save points seem fairly spaced. One caveat is that you can buy guns, health, but not ammunition. This forces you to choose your weapon to match your opponent and use it wisely to conserve ammo. I highly recommend this game."
5,AWESOME!!,"If you somehow dont have this for game for some reason,GET IT,don't listen to BULL,a great step forward with the combat feature helps to save bullets,ever get annoyed trying to remember where your going,the map is a great idea,the guns,the bosses,the storyline,MATERPIECE!! THE BEST!!"
5,I got this game at the wrong time,"What I mean is, I got this game the Friday of dead week, which is the week right before finals, and that was reflected in how poorly I did on my finals. I played this game almost every waking moment after I got it, it was so awesome. I beat it twice in two weeks, which is the fastest I've ever beaten the same game multiple times.The action in the game is awesome, the graphics are nice, the feel is good, and the replay value is top notch. I haven't gone through it a third time yet, although I've started a third game, mostly because I wanna have some varitey, and play something else. I'll probably pick the game back up later this summer, and continue the head-shooting, as opposed to butt-kicking."
5,Love it,"This got me into the Resident Evil series. The game is amazing, and I believe it still is an excellent game versus the games released today. Only possible downside was one of the discs couldn't play on my Gamecube, but my Gamecube is over 10 years old so I wouldn't blame the discs. Works flawlessly on the Wii, I would recommend it to anyone."
2,sorry but i think this is one of the worst REs i have ever played,sorry game way to easy really fun thoguht i give it that i kinda would rather watch it as a real movie and heres what i would expect to seeLeonrido Decaprio Shoot nothing but Infected Germains see him take on the boss and the guy with a giant machine gun. and him and Van Damme from street fighter do the 2min Knife fight and the last part of the game. i would rather watch as Movie than Play game
4,The place to go when you don't know where to go next,This is a very wonderful reference book. It is laid out in a easy to use format. I have used it as a guide to what I will read next as well as researching various themes in sci fi literature. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about science fiction.
2,You get what you pay for.,"In our busy home the cutlery 'caddy' is the fastes way to get a meal going. Our first was a caddy set from Crate & Barrel. Great set, good feel in use. I suspect our kids were not that careful tossing trash in the garbage, and we lost fork after spoon, etc. I'd had enough of the odd mix of knives and soup spoons and came to Amazon to find another caddy. This set sounded geart so inexpensively, I thought I'd pick up a couple and fill in when stuff was lost. BOTTOM LINE: Cutlery is thinand awfully light weight. One becomes aware of ""balance"" in good cutlery when using a spoon or fork because these light utensils have none. Hard to 'work' with, and the fork is absurd trying to cut with the tines. Going to order the more expensive set which, I assume, will be about the quality of the Crate & Barrel product."
1,Disappointed,"While I realize I didn't spend a lot of money on this product, I didn't expect it to be quite so cheaply made. I put the silverware in the dishwasher and one of the spoons became worthless. Apparently, the silverware is made in two parts and the handle became loose. When you use a knife on butter that is not soft, it literally will not cut straight down. As you have probably surmised, I would not recommend this product. On the plus side, I bought two sets, so if you need one just let me know. I'll sell it cheaply."
4,Silverware & Caddy,This is a great and convenient item. I love the look/style. The flatware is slightly light (could be a bit heavier). Practical and stylish.
4,A different approach to nature photography,"Freeman Patterson's books are always worth reading because his style and approach are different than that of most photographers. His images don't really bowl you over like the super-saturated pictures most nature photographers employ. They are much more subtle - almost pastel - pictures some might term impressionistic, although most are straight-forward documentary images of subjects within their enviroments. The subject as a part of its enviroment is very important in Patterson's presentations. The book also is a good lesson in ecology. Although not as instructive as several of his book, it is a good indoctrination about what to look for in nature. The images themselves, while most are not dramatic, are pleasing to look at might change your idea about what good nature photography is all about."
5,A Must Have!,For any busy mom who likes to cook or bake this is a fantastic addition to your cookbook collection. From very simple and tasty recipes the kids will enjoy to luscious fun-to-make desserts that will become favorites. This cookbook is easy to read and has wonderful pictures as well. I love it!
5,The Best Cookbook I Have Ever Bought,"I purchased this cookbook for my daughter who is just beginning to cook. This is an excellent cookbook with all the best recipes from the Bake-Off from 1949 until now. The recipes include appetizers, entrees, and desserts and are easy enough for even the beginning cook to understand. There are short paragraphs about the winners, beautiful full page photographs and interesting tidbits about the Bake-Off history. We have tried a few of the recipes, and they are delicious. My daughter is constantly asking if she can cook dinner for us and is anxious to try them all. This is the best cookbook I have ever purchased, and after cooking for over 25 years, I have bought quite a few. This cookbook can be bought for beginning cooks to experienced cooks, and it will be one they all will enjoy."
5,This Guy Needs A Major Label,"If I listen to country it's usually Ole Time country, Im not really kine on todays country sounds, looks or attitudes, it wasn't until a few years ago when floyd's demo reached me on community radio, through some strange friends, after a first listen, my faith was resorted in his traditional/new country sound and style with numberous tracks that I could relate with, so much so that I have most of his albums (SOON TO PURCHASE MORE) The biggest let down is the lack of being unknown, Floyds music is a lot better then 90% of todays country top 40, hands down! if not 100% which is shocking because Im a huge late 70's early 80's punk fan, Floyd is the real deal, he has a heart for country and how he's not decovered? God only knows? So when Im feeling country I don't turn on the radios' top 40 country station, I pop in one of Floyds albums. great stuff!!!!"
2,Only one-third good,"There are fifteen stories in this book. However, I only found 5 to be good. I was disappointed with the novel. I suggest Beverly Jenkins' books if you want an excellent read."
1,BOOOOOORING,Not a good book at all the book is missing alot of things and I don't have all day to tell them all
2,Disjoined and confusing,"I was not very impressed by this book. Its stories were disjointed and repetitive. When properly done, a complex narrative style can be very rewarding(e.g. Thomas Pynchon). However, in this case all it did was confuse the issue. I quickly became disinterested in what the book had to say. Even after a second reading, many of the stories lacked any sort of coherence. I would not recommend this book."
4,wish I had more info when I purchased,"I wish the photo provided by the seller was better, and that I had more info upon purchase. The plastic coating was only on one side, and the other side is the cottony stuff. I've purchased other meat pads that fully covered the inserts. I'm hoping this won't stick to the venison when it freezes. We'll find out next hunting season, because this was a Christmas purchase, after deer season was over."
4,Good product so far,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. My skin definitely smoothed out a little. little bumps under the skin that i used to have are now 80% gone, and my face looks more even toned. But that is expected from AHA products. I'm not sure this is worth the price, but so far so good. If i see more improvement after finishing the bottle, i will definitely consider buying it again.btw the bottle is very nice. i feel like half the cost went to the bottle itself :-D"
3,Pretty good product,"This is a pretty good product, but don't expect to see amazing result in 72 hours. This product does not work miracles. If you use the product consistently for about a year you should see results. If you use the product moderately about twice a week or once every few weeks it should last you an entire year. You should seriously consider buying several products for your skin care regimen. Do not rely on this product to take of all of her skin problems on its own."
1,I was fooled,"I was admit after reading the review on amazon i was sure this was going to be the product to get rid of these ance scarring but after using the product for a week i havent even seen the slightly improvement, now im not sayin i was expecting to see 100% improvement but i was expecting to see something that was saying okay this is working,the only thing this product does is slightly burn when i put on my face, and then thats it. The worst if i do see improvement ill make sure to erase this review and write a better one"
5,Jesus from an Islamic perspective,"Contrary to what most Westerners might believe, the personality of Jesus in Islam is familiar and quite fully developed. He is loved and revered for his ""poverty"" and detachment from the mundane. The ""Sufi"" view of Jesus is really the Islamic one, since Sufism is merely Islam practiced from the heart. This collection of stories from various sources presents parables and anecdotes in which Jesus features as the humblest and closest to God of human beings."
4,Another Great Don Giovanni Recording.,"This 1953 Salzburg Festival live recording may be as good as my current favorite, the 1956 Salzburg recording, also live, with Mitropoulos conducting. Unlike many critics, I like Tito Gobbi's more malevolant Giovanni from Furtwangler's 1950 (if I remember right) Salzburg recording. However, Siepi's performances in this recording, and in the Mitropoulos version, are impressive. The remainder of the cast is excellent in both versions, though Mitropoulos' forces probably have the edge and may have been the best cast, for this opera, ever recorded. In all of his versions of Don Giovanni, Furtwangler takes a darker, more tragic approach to this opera than most conductors, Mitropoulos included. This works, and works well. 4.5/5 stars."
3,okay..............,"This cd was not as good as i hoped. I liked a few songs, lets go all night, ole ole, ladies night.... It could have been better. The beats to most songs were good, but the lyrics were really weird. Its a good dancing cd, but..... If you want a good cd, Mya's fear of flying is great."
5,Quilter's Review of Pink Lemonade and Other Delights,"I love this book! The directions are easy to understand and the sewing directions are easy to pickup. Would purchase other books by this author. The instructions are easy enough for a beginner to understand or for the more advanced quilter. Hurry and get this one, it's a keeper!"
1,Poor design,"This shoehorn is very poorly designed. You should notice that it does not flair out like most shoehorns. This results not only in painfully cutting into your heel when using it, but also does not keep the shoe wide enough for your heel to fit into your shoe. Obviously corners were cut in the design so that manufacturing cost were kept to a minimum to enable a better profit margin. It is Truly torture to use this product."
1,Junk,"Although the length is adequate, the metal is so thin that it bent the very first use. I had to resort to asking for help to get my shoe on. I'll order another product, but it won't be this one."
4,No more watching things on the small monitor...,"I bought this primarily so that I could watch DivX on the TV in bed. So far, I've had a great experience with this. It plays most of the mainstream codecs such as Xvid, mpg, DivX. The interface is great and it's very very easy to use. Shove a HD in and you're good to go. I gave this product 4 stars as oppose to 5 because some files don't play correctly and codecs such as Real, OGM or WMV are not supported. (Though this situation can easily be remedied by converting the video and who knows perhaps in the future they'll release a firmware upgrade to support more.) Overall, this was a great purchase. I would buy another one if I needed another one without much thought."
2,Could be much better,"Product works well as advertised.Problem is, not much is advertised at all.The FAQ and forums in english are pathetic.First, they mention how the TVIX will work with even 400GB HDDs, after I bought a 300GB SATA HDD I found that it will only take IDE HDDs.Also, the codec capability is very limited and you cannot incorporate any codecs into the system, you have to wait and hope for them to integrate them.And if you were wondering TVix will not display srt subtitles.Simply this product is not ready for the US market."
2,"Beautiful Bette,Bad Biography","This is not a very good biography of Bette Davis.The dates are not right and a lot of the ""facts"" are not accurate.The person who wrote this obviosly didn't take the time to do some research because throughout the entire biography there are countless errors.If you knew anything about the wonderful Bette Davis,you would agree that the whole thing is way off."
3,The bad little dog who suddenly wasn't,"Leslie McGuirk, Ho, Ho, Ho, Tucker! (Candlewick, 2005)Cute-enough Christmas story featuring a naughty little dog... or at least a dog who starts off as a naughty little dog and then becomes Rudolph the Red-Nosed Puppy. Okay, okay, I know, it's kind of ridiculous of me to talk about, and maybe even to expect, character consistency in a board book written for the pre-lit set, but David Shannon manages it in the Diaper David books with exactly this kind of character. Still, Davey's having a good time with it, so I'll keep reading it to him on and off before bed until it has to go back to the library. ***"
3,foregive me,"i have not read the book yet ,how can i write my comments on somethig i did not see or read. thankyou"
3,CS2 versions were always so slow,It was ok but now there up to CS4 and its was faster. The entire CS2 line was super slow and always crashed.
5,Destiny takes the wheel is a gem.,Ellen Thorn is a gifted song writer with a enchanting voice. If folk music is what your looking for you won't be disapointed.
5,"""We'll get you back!""","This brilliant episode would serve to set-up the two part ""Improbable Cause"" and ""Die is Cast"" that explores a mysterious Cardassian fleet being created by the Obsidian Order and inprison Thomas Riker. Thom steals the Defiant, with Kira onboard, and begins what appears to be random attacks on Cardassian outposts. These soon turn out to be calculated raids that will make it easier for the Defiant to slip deep behind enemy lines to the heart of Cardassian territory, in search of a rogue shipyard. The scenes between Kira and Riker are wonderful, equal to those between Gul Dukat and Sisko. A well written, fast paced episode with a great ending. DS9 at it's best."
1,What?!,"I'm an Otaku, and I think this book was really bad.This was the first book I read from Christopher Hart, and it really gave me a bad impression. It was less like Manga, and more like cartoons! Even the body proportions he gives you at the beginning are messed up.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but the most desperate. I would rather recommend the ""How to draw Manga"" series."
3,Better From Others,"Specifically regarding Horrors From Space Collection from Triton Multimedia. Teenagers From Outer Space and Phantom From Space are substandard compared to other releases by other low-price distributors such as Treeline/Mill Creek. Killers From Space is better than same from Mill Creek's Sci Fi Classics Collection.All three are black-and-white, low-budget B-movies. They are slightly entertaining if you like low-budget sci-fi films but are not bad enough to be in the league with Plan 9 From Outer Space and certainly not as entertaining as the Universal Studios sci fi serials from the 1930s/40s such as Flash Gordon, Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, Flash Gordon Trip to Mars, and Buck Rogers.Considering the Triton collection is is being sold for $0.65 plus shipping, it is a relative bargain. Personally, I would spend another dollar or two and buy better copies or something more entertaining. But, that is your decision."
5,Great quick reference,"I am an infrequent Excel user, so I needed a good reference book that is well indexed. That's exactly what I got with Excel 2003 QuickSteps. It's easy to find what I need when I want it. It's very well illustrated and contains a lot of great tips. The author does an excellent job of explaining the material."
3,Early work by an excellent author,"These stories, which read like one long story (no jarring breaks), are earlier works by an author who I really enjoy reading. To me, the characters here are not nearly as complex as in her later works, and there are things that to me, are not as well explained as they could be. For example, why was her mother the way she was? Why does it cost money to go into *every* position in the fleet? Is there enough wealth in the society that even the grunts can afford the tuition? Or is conquest and defense so far from their minds that they don't need grunts? (These questions may also be answered in the future books in the series, which I haven't read yet.)The story is good and the writing itself is good, but please read one of her later works as well to experience her true storytelling skills."
4,An introduction to a remarkable woman,"Alysha's Fall is the story of a strong woman determined to do what it takes to get the life she wants. We see exactly what Alysha is willing to do - and to sacrifice - to get there.For those of you who are fans of MCA Hogarth's other work, such as The Aphorisms or Worth of a Shell, this is a more abrasive work. Some of Alysha's choices and some of the people she meets are ugly ones, and there is no gentle first-person narrator to help you over the rough spots.The stories aren't all pain. She meets kind people, too, but the focus of the collection is on the steely character of Alysha herself. It's a good introduction to an admirable and interesting woman."
5,Antique review by new fans in Puerto Rico,"I got the chance to hear Antique's music in a cruise by the Caribbean last january. I fell in love with the music instantly. I bought the C.D. it's a great music, AND BELIVE ME even it's a Greek music and I don't understand the part of the music that is in Greek language I love it and I STRONGLY recommend it."
2,Sorry to differ from the reader below.,"This book is little or no use unless you have a very strong background infield theoretical methods. If you are a seasoned pro. you might find ituseful but if you want to teach yourself.... you will soon get frustrated.Still my hat's off to the authors who pioneered the area.Conclusion: if you are a PhD student, get Fetter & Walecka instead."
4,Very good book,This book is one of the most known treating about QFT in non-zero temperatures and it doesn't need an advertisement. One think that redactors should think about is size of the fonts. Letters are really to small...
2,What happened to my favorite product?,When did the formula change on this product? when I re ordered it there was no mention of it. I just used it and it is more than sugary!This was a PLUS FIVE STARS productPlease advise . Thank you.
2,not just wax,This used to be the best product out there...pure wax. The newer packets however melt into a sugary substance...and does not work as well. Please bring back pure wax!
5,the best point and shoot,"I needed something simple, and to the point. I did not want to explain why my wife would want to use the tamron lense over the pentax......I am going on a cruise, i want things simple....for both of us.I am experienced with slr's.....very experienced.This camera, after doing the research..as well as comparing the stats.......wins 5 stars hands down.i just took an experimental role of film.......kodak 400 high definition, the first in the camera and used the roll to see what it can produce. blown away! i shot photos of the George Washington bridge.....the way the shadows were cast, and the way the definition is so unreal. This is the best point and shoot ever!"
5,Great Game,"This game is great. It has good graphics and a nice interface. A little long on the loading time but I can handle it. Loved the amount of pros there were.If you want to buy a console game buy TopSpin.Twenty times better, just not as many current tennis players."
4,Not Quite 5-Star,"This is a great collection, but I can't rate it as high as THE KEY CD or HIGH LONESOME SOUND. This one includes Gill's classics, ""Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away"", ""One More Last Chance"", & the ballads ""Nothing Like a Woman"", ""Tryin' to Get Over You"", & the title track. Most of the ballads here are nice, but I would've preferred more variety like there is on THE KEY. ""Pretty Words"" is also a nice upbeat, bluegrassy tune. This CD is definitely worth getting, but if you're looking for your first Vince collection, I would go with the other two first."
5,Steam Lovers Heaven,All 4 Seasons is caught in magnificent splendor with steam steam steam! Wow...I'm in awe. Fantastic set and very fair price. If you have a new LCD TV with home theater sound this is a must have!!!
2,Travlaoge,"If you like pretty pictures of the four seasons you will like this. If you want to see and hear about trains, not so much."
1,Problems with Copyright Protection,"Will only play in car and on home stereo. Can't play with laptop with means I can't import to S3. Can't listen to this while traveling on plane, etc. Very lame limitations."
5,Movie Review,was satisfied with the overall quality of this product. it arrived in a professional and courteous manner. i would definitely recommend this seller to anyone.
4,Nice shaver,"As one that has decided a blade was just not cutting it anymore due to constant irritation, I have to say this one does a nice job of keeping me smooth enough for the wife, but not so close as to burn my face. The wet/dry is really nice and the first time I tried a wet shave, I actually got razor burn. I can use this razor every day with no problems and keep it clean with a quick rinse. As for charging...I haven't recharged in almost a full month, so battery life is very good. I'm happy with it."
3,Good deal; I wish they lasted longer,A necessary evil if you don't want to clean it every day. A little cheaper than buying them direct from Panasonic. Delivery was quick.
4,Dencent Cleaning for an acceptable price,"I have used the Braun's cleaning system/shaver units before. They are quite expensive compared to this but had a fresh scent and better cleaned feeling. This one works for sure but didn't like the scent very much (smells like a very hard/strong soap).But, definitely convenient than washing the shaver myself."
4,Awesome,"Not that I know anything about the product, but my fella loved it! Works great especially with his sensitive skin!"
1,"These are a ripoff, use hydrogen peroxide","These cartridges look like something Panasonic added to their charger/washer in order to make a few extra bucks. I decided to try an alternative: hydrogen peroxide.After your first included cartridge is 'used up' (the soap only lasts a few weeks before it gets smelly), just fill empty out the reservoir and fill it with hydrogen peroxide (which you can get at the drugstore for a dollar or two a bottle). I've gone through a few cycles with the peroxide and it works great - the razor head is just as clean, if not more clean, than with the soap, which always made it smell kind of mildewed."
4,Cartridge Cleaner Leaves Foil Fresh Smelling,These cleaning cartridges disinfect and clean the shaver head. The product works very well but is not outstanding (more solution and better cleaning is needed).
1,Something is wrong,I ordered this item thinking it was the same as the one supplied with my shaver. It is perhaps old stock. Panasonic said I should have bought it from them to be sure I obtained the correct cartridge. Not worth fussing with a return so I hope it does not ruin the Panasonic shaver cleaning unit.
1,Junk,That is the best way to put it. Do not waste your money on this or the inferior razors Panasonic offers (see my review on the ES8077 model). When my razor finally dies I will use a Braun which even though it uses alcohol based cleaners is a far superior product
1,Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges,I haven't used it because I shave dry 99% of the time. I wish I had not bought this as part of the purchase package.
1,Useless Item,"I meant to purchase only a shaver, but Amazon recommended that it would go great with my shaver. It is useless because you need the Vortex cleaning system which my shaver doesn't need. So this item is useless to me and it would cost me more to return it than to just keep and throw it away. Make sure you have the Vortex cleaning system before buying this item. This is a 1 star because of Amazon's mistake in recommending it."
5,The best shaving solution cartridge you'll ever buy - an emotional experience.,"This cartridge is not only the cartridge required by the manufacturer, without which the shaver's cleaning system won't work. It is also a piece of plastic which happens to fit perfectly into the base of this shaver (for which it was specifically designed). The only products you can say that for are other shaving solution cartridges designed specifically for other shaving systems which, let's face it, probably fit equally as well. Don't take my word for it, if you own a Panasonic shaving system which requires this cartridge - I'd say give it a try. You can try cartridges designed for other shaving systems, but may find the lack of compatibility frustrating after 36 or 37 tries."
5,Works Great!,"This works great! I'm the type to always clean my shaver, and this makes it some much easier. This little cartridge is basically soap for your Panasonic Vortex Electric Razor. These are getting really hard to find in the stores, and they're cheaper on Amazon."
3,Does not last nearly as long as they say,"If you just put the shaver in the cleaner, it does not last 30 cleanings, at least for me - and that is consistent (after 17 to 21 cleanings, the red light comes on). I suppose if I took the extra time to pre-clean before cleaning, then it would last longer. But, that adds time I do not have, and the whole point was that it was supposed to be you just drop in and it cleans. The Braun one did last a real 30 cleanings. The problem seems to be the way the cleaner works. Because it is a dry powder that water is pushed through, it clogs at the top. I can see there is plenty of soap under the top, but it is clogged at the top with hair. So, assume you will get less time unless you clean the shaver 1st or you have slow beard growth."
4,Convenient,"I ordered 3 packs of these because of the price and convenience. They arrived in a timely fashion and because I ordered three, there was no shipping charge!"
5,baldnlextown,A must have for keeping your Vortex Razor clean and performing at the highest quality. Use the razor to not only shave my face but entire head also. Regular cleaning with the system made my original blades last 18 months. A must to have an d keep on hand to change regularly.
5,Great shave for an electric,"I like this razor. I never get as close a shave as with a blade, but this is the best electric razor I've found. I recommend it to others.I especially like the self cleaning function."
2,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this. I own the ES8078 and used the cartridges for a while. Until I figured out that you will get a 10,000,000 x cleaner razor ( that foul odor that never seems to go away) and 10,000,000 cleaner shave if you simply remove the blade and place both the blade and the razor in your dishwasher. If you have a holder with a lid it will help (obviously) with the loose blade. But try it!! I have had the closest shave since I purchased the razor, AND it doesn't smell anymore!!"
2,HydraClean Cartridge,I would rate this product a lot higher if the cartridges lasted longer. They claim that they last about a month with daily use but I can only get no more that half that much before they show to be empty. They do a good job of cleaning but just don't last long enough.
4,Right refill & good service,The shaver and cleaning system work well. I have used them daily for 5 months now.The refills worked. They shipped the next day. Overall I had a good experience. The price seems high for what you get. Amazon was slightly less anyone else that had it.
4,Appears to do what it's supposed to do,"I replace these every couple months when I think of it because I've yet to see an indicator go off telling me I should do so. This is probably because I rinse the shaver after every use, so there isn't maybe so much to clean. Nothing to complain about, seems to do its job, reasonable price. Hurrah!"
3,Nothing special,"I always rinse my razor and screen after shaving so putting it through a cleaning cycle doesn't really do much. I don't change this cartridge very often, perhaps once every 6 months. I put the razor through a cleaning cycle every week but don't think it gets any cleaner than just rinsing it after each use."
2,Not a Good Deal,"These cartridges work just fine -- for about a week. Then the red light comes on. They're supposed to last for a month or so, but they sure don't last that long for me. I wish I'd bought the razor alone and forgotten about the cleaning system. It would be fine if these cartridges worked as advertised, but $3.33 for a week of cleaning is ridiculous."
3,It ain't cheap but it works,The title says it all. The cartridge is expensive but it works just like it is supposed to.
2,"Works, but doesn't last long...","The filters work as advertised, but really don't last long before clogging up. I think I will just use regular tap water and soap to clean from now on."
4,Vortex HydraClean Cartridge,The Vortex HydraClean System does a fantastic job of cleaning and preparing the shaver for excellent daily shaving. This is the best shaver and cleaning system I have ever used.
4,This CD Rocks,"Every song on this album is excellent rock/punk....very catchy..high energy. There are a couple of slow songs and they're very good. Believe me, ""American Psycho"" is just the tip of the iceberg. I love this band. I love their sound. You'll love this CD. Why aren't they more famous?"
2,Too Mainstream!,"Treble Charger has grown as a band but it may not have been for the better. With Wide Awake Bored they enter into the mainstream of ""rock"" so to speak. They had their own type of style but now they just sound like any other band out there. Sure, you may like songs like ""American Psycho"" but that is why everyone likes them now is because of this tune. Have a listen to the other CDs that Treble Charger release prior to this one. The three really good ones prior to this are ""Self-Title"",""NC-17"", and ""Maybe It's Me"" If you have a chance to listen to these you'll respect Treble Charger's prior music taste. It seems they have tried to enter a realm of artists who change their look and sound just to suit what's hip. They were a great band once and can be again. If you're interested in picking up a few of these CDs e-mail me at (e-mail address)Thanks :)"
5,Boat Load of Fun,"Great collection of songs from his many ""On the Road"" and other movies. Jimmy Durante joins Bob on ""The Boys With The Proboscis"" and Bing Crosby joins Bob on songs from their buddy movies. A lot of fun -- good listening!"
4,Playing Cowboys!,I like this toy although I do feel it is a overpriced. It should stand about $12.99 to $14.99 the most. I like it because it makes a realistic sound. It has no sharp or rough edges and it is a nice size for a little boy. There aren't many western style weapons out there that don't shoot caps and make a realistic firing noise. You can always buy the cap guns but the caps give off a smell and the loud bang is not what I need right now.I prefer this rifle and revolver combination for their accurate yet not overpowering blast sound. The set also has a bandana(small) and a badge. Both essential items to recreate life in the old west.
4,City under the back steps,I loved reading this book as a child! It really pulled me into this fanciful filled tale. I would love my children to read it!
4,Game business best practice magazine,"This is the only magazine to my knowledge that deals with business practices as well as technical topics of game creation. GDM has postmortem on recent successful games, summarizing how these games were made, what the creators did right and what they could have done better. They also has columns devoted to Project Management, Game design, Graphics technique, Product reviews and trend analysis.All in all this is a must have if you're in the game industry or, like myself, dream of being in the game creation business. Most of the time these articles do not go into a lot of details because of length constrain. That might be the only drawback."
4,Good Magzine but get it for free,"This is one of those industry trade journals that they ""charge"" for but if you are in the business send for free. Visit their site and see if you qualify before you pay for a subscription."
1,Magazine may be great... subscription service is NOT,The info on this product says: Availability: The first issue should arrive in 6-10 weeks.When I hadn't received the magazine in over 8 weeks I spent 15 minutes on the phone snaking my way to a person who could help only to be told their system had crashed moments before I called and they could NOT help me. I'd have to call back later.What they did tell me was it takes 3 MONTHS to process subscriptions when ordered through Amazon. This was a Christmas gift and I'm not happy right now.If you want this magazine (and my game developer son says it's good) go order it from Game Developer directly.
2,Disney characters a big distraction,"My child loves to read and learn - at age 4, she would pick up encyclopedias without prompting, and then exclaim about any interesting facts. However, whenever we pick up this book, all she wants to talk about are the Disney characters, period.The format is good for comparisons between countries, but that is also its limitation - it fails to highlight the unique things about a country. It is very blend. It also only covers a few countries per continents. Half of the countries we want to look-up aren't there. We ended up just using the web.The book is also very wordy. The few times we tried to look up particular countries in this book, we felt like we had read for a long time without learning anything. It is a big ""interest squasher"". I love learning and I'm bored by it. It is really just a way of Disney marketing its characters. Don't buy it unless your kid won't read unless he sees Disney characters."
1,Ancient Voices-Stonehenge is not worth seeing.,"Delivery was prompt.""Ancient Voices- Stonehenge"" was completely lacking in scientific value. I had purchased it to show to my seventh grade Geography class, and even the students saw it as quite poor. It is full of production values with night time shots with plenty of smoke and back lighting. Unfortunately, it contained almost none of the latest research, and instead speculated in the ""Could it be"" nonsense.This video is not worth buying."
1,There's a reason this TV is not available anymore...,"It's a shame that you can't just buy a good product from areputable company and have it work for several years. We hada problem with this TV the 2nd month we had it. Would Not Turnon. Got it fixed (but it was hassle) under warranty, done.Now a year later, it's doing the same exact thing. Won't turnon. Now i have to hassle with calling Samsung once again andI can't watch the TV i paid a lot of money for. I'm happy withthe other Samsung Products I own, but i'm NEVER buying anotherSamsung TV, this is terrible. Don't these things pass inspection?"
3,"Volume problem and now, no power at all.",The volume of this model does not seem to go any further than about 32 and any higher setting doesn't give you any more sound.Have had this TV for almost 11 months and the power has now gone.Having it repaired under warranty but not buying another one.
3,Dead TV,"The new Samsung died today ... we bought it new about 5 weeks ago. When I went on line and did a review search for this particular TV, I found that other people also had this problem. We are going to return this one and keep trying until we get one that works for more than a month. Why? Because my husband likes the picture, size and price. We bought our last TV in 1989 and it lasted until January 2008."
1,waste of money,"Bought this tv less than two years ago, and all of a sudden it won't turn on...We don't watch that much tv, so its not as if we ran it into the ground, the thing still looks brand new!Before this tv, I had a crappy Emerson 13"" that I purchased at Walmart for $70, and it lasted me over 10 years without fail, broken buttons and all!I'm sad to find out that other people have had the same problem with this Samsung model...I will take their advise and not purchase a Samsung tv again!!!"
2,Something's not right here...,"If you're looking to use this TV for HD, look elsewhere. The extreme and ridiculous amount of bowing on the sides of this TV are so noticeable that I found watching it to be depressing. Fine object detail is just at an acceptable level and colors could be better.Granted, the audio is great.Picture quality: Awful.Audio quality: Wonderful.Don't spend your money on this."
2,Beware the flat tube!,"Purchased this TV and returned it after a week. Couldn't stand the picture anymore. Overall picture was okay, but the flat tube apparently has problems. Scrolling tickers across the bottom of the screen appear to be waving in the breeze. I looked at other flat tubes when I returned it, and saw 3 more on display with the same problem. Any horizontal graphic looks curved, bowed, or slanted -- anything but straight and level. Also, very difficult to get accurate colors on this TV. Much better off to spend a little more for an LCD."
1,Lasted 7 days!,"Picture was great for 6 days! On the 7th day, it rested.Now it just displays a white zig-zag line on a grey background. Glad it blew up during the return period.After reading other reviews today, I assume mine must have slipped past quality control. Most units last about a month before major problems and the buyer is stuck with warranty repairs. I guess Samsung will have to eat this one!"
1,Buyer beware. Lemon. Broke twice in < 3 year period.,"Bought Samsung 27 in 01/2008. Picture did not come in 13 months after use. TV was NOT moved/abused in any way. Called Samsung, and they agreed to fix it under the 12 month warranty...which was nice. TV was fixed. Then, last month, 12/2010, the TV no longer turned on...it was not the outlet, and no power surge occurred. Since it was out of the warranty period it is now a piece of junk. Any TV that fails twice in a 3 year period is no good. Plus the picture is not that good. Full screen TVs are out dated people, buy a widescreen TV. This TV had big black columns on the HD/widescreen programing, cutting the viewable area from 27 inches to about 23 inches.DO NOT BUY. I've had good luck with other samsung products (DLP TV) so this is purely directed at the TX-T2782."
3,"Somewhat amusing, but long-winded","Gets bogged down in details, and the writing could be a lot more crisp (see Moody's The Diviners - a similar take on indie film). Mostly likeable for its use of NYC locales, while the confused characters try to put on independent theater productions, while sleeping around as much as possible. The voice of the protagonist is not convincing -- I doubt any woman, lipstick lesbians included, thinks about sex in baseball metaphors. Maybe the author thought he could get away with lapses in point of view if he made her a lesbian? Don't they think like men? I don't know. She just wasn't convincing for me, and it wasn't funny enough to read as satire. Read The Diviners instead."
5,A jaw-dropping ending propels this one to the top!,"""The Jem'Hadar"" stands as one of DS9's most intense episodes, introducing the viewers to the one-dimensional ""policemen"" of the Founders in the form of the title characters and the conniving and sinister Vorta. Both would be a staple for the duration of the show's run.The kamikaze attack during the installment's final minutes still remains one of the most shocking scenes in Trek history."
4,Boa Musica Contemporanea,"If you like a mix of Brasilian music, then this is a disk for you. It includes many styles of Brasilian music that were played on the popular novela of the same title. I like the songs, mostly, but there are a few I'd rather not listen to."
2,"Good movies, but substandard quality","Both movies are a very good addition to any classic or horror movie collection. This disk, however, is not! The video transfer is supposedly ""restored"", but you would never know it. The Most Dangerous Game was watchable, but certain scenes were very washed out with lots of dirt and scratches. I had even worse success with The Vampire Bat. The movie started ok, but my DVD player actually had trouble reading the disk about mid-way through. It got so bad, that I had to stop watching the movie. If your main interest in this disk is, The Most Dangerous Game (by far the superior of the two films), then I suggest the Criterion release."
2,Substandard Materials Make for the Worst-Looking DVD Yet!,"These two golden age horror films are done a gross disservice by E-Biz's DVD pressing. Ostensibly struck from 35mm original elements from The National Museum (whoever they are!), what we are given in reality is a scratchy, overly-bright and, most unforgiveably, OUT OF FOCUS, copy of ""Most Dangerous Game""! My public domain Beta copy from 15 years ago looks better than this! The soundtrack is equally poor, filled with loud hiss. ""The Vampire Bat"" fares slightly better; this copy looks no worse than the old pd-videotape copies. At least it's in focus throughout. But this print is NOT complete. My old tape copy runs almost three-minutes longer. My advice is to avoid this disc. ""Game"" is also available on Criterion, so that's the one to buy. This is ""Bat's"" DVD debut, so stick with any of the numerous acceptable tape copies until somebody gets it right on DVD."
2,Vampire Bat is Slow and Talky,"Film was actually shot at Universal outdoor lot, and interior of Atwill's home was supposedly used in The Old Dark House(which is excellent!).This film icludes Melvyn Douglas, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye. Too bad that the cast can't help this slow and talky production. I never did understand, exactly, what Atwill's character was trying to do!This was made by Majestic Pictures which sounds like the 1930s version of Monogram studios!This is pretty much lame, low-budget fare.I am a die-hard fan of the genre and would own a copy just to say I have it, but I would never watch it again(once was enough! ).Watch Mark of the Vampire as it is much better and includes Bela."
3,Fay Wray double feature on DVD,"If you like Fay Wray then you will like these. The 1st film ""Most dangerous game"" is not bad. A madman hunts people down like animals on his Island and Fay Wray becomes one of the hunted. The only bad thing is that the picture quality is not the best but probobly due to the orig print. Also, the madman (hunter) character is a little campy. The 2nd movie i actually enjoyed more. The story is not as strong but the actors are good. The Vampire Bat!! This movie is complete with decent atmosphere and the townsfolk running scared of so called Vampires or something. It turns out its Lionel Atwill playing a mad doctor taking the blood of the people for his experiments. Fay Wray is in typical good form as always. The picture quality is clearer in this movie but it has some junk in the picture but that was expected since these are 1930's films. Enjoy!"
2,Not as absorbent as I'd like,"Note that the fine print says the color is Ecru, but the listing is for Ivory -- you may get an yellower towel than you expect.These towels aren't as thick or absorbent as some others that I ordered at the same time -- they're clearly the lesser towels. Look instead for a 725 gram fabric weight."
4,Good towel for big men,"I bought these towels for my brother, who is 6 feet 5 inches and around 230 pounds. Granted, at first he wasn't too thrilled about receiving these as a Christmas present, but the first time he used them, I got an e-mail from him about how much he appreciated the larger sized towel. My reaction was that for the price, $14.99 for two plus free shipping and no tax (on orders over $25), they were a great deal. The quality is a little better than the price would indicate; they are a lighter weight towel, which was what I was aiming for in order not to choke the washing machine. I will check with my brother after he washes them a few times to see how they are holding up and then update this review."
3,What choice do we have?,"It's often hard to find light bulbs for small recessed fixtures, especially ones with higher wattage. This is the only 75w PAR16 I've seen in a while. One night the glass lens and metal securing band simply ""let go"" and fell onto my work counter -- it didn't break but it was hot enough to burn your fingers and rather disarming. So I wouldn't consider this a particularly high-quality item but it serves the purpose. You just don't want to be underneath the thing when the lens falls on you. (I was able to put it back together with some high-tempo silicone and it's still working.) The supplier's service was excellent; the package arrived in a few days."
3,"Product works, but is basically obsolete","This product is a dinosaur. I bought it because it fits my fixture, but I'm going to retire the whole thing. Halogen is extremely hot (well over 200 degrees surface temperature according to my IR gun), has poor efficiency and they burn out frequently. There is actually a black soot on my ceiling next to these bulbs, that's how hot they run. A single one of these bulbs would cost you 80 bucks a year if you left it on all the time. I am going to retire this in favor of LED lighting, which runs cool, lasts nearly forever and uses a third of the electricity."
5,Might be his BEST!,I was skeptical when I heard George Strait was starring in a movie. And up until then I was Really Just a casual fan but I'll tell you. One listen to this soundtrack and things changed. I became a big fan and started listening to his old stuff and payed more attention to the new. IMO every one of the songs on this album should've been on his boxed set and saying that I'd highly recommend this C.D. for any fan. It's a Must Have.
5,george strait is the best,"IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR GEORGE S. TO WIN ANY AWARDS,BUT ONCE HE DID HE CANT STOP. THE INDUSTRY DIDNT FALL IN LOVE WITH HIS MUSIC LIKE WE THE FANS DID OR AT LEAST NOT AS FAST BUT I GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR FINALLY SEEING THE GENIUS THAT HE IS. HE SHOULD COME TO MILWAUKEE SOMETIME, WERE FANS TOO."
2,"Weak soundtrack music, dull ballads!","George Strait can make good music and albums, but the songs he did for his only movie Pure Country sound flat and dull. Heartland's the only good song. The rest of the album is a wastleland of dull ballads and uptempo country songs that would be better sung at a lost bar in Arizona. I was a little disturbed that an artist of George's high caliber would record these songs. Avoid this one at all turns!"
4,pure country,Great cd. The case it came in was all broken up. Broken up meaning the case front and back were cracked up and the hinges were broken up. But the cd is in great condition! Listening to it will put you in a dancing mood. !
5,sweet,This product was bought as a gift for someone else. I guess you always take a chance when you buy something sight unseen. I was very pleased with the condition that it was in and had no quirms about giving it as a gift. The recipient was ecstatic over it and thought I was the best person in the world. The sound is fabulous delivery was well timed( in time for Christmas ).Thank you.
1,Be warned,"The title of this book is ""The Cambridge Medieval history by J. B. Bury"" It should state that it is only Volume I of Cambridge Medieval history. I already own volume I in a physical copy, however I don't have several other volumes and was hoping that I could easily complete my collection by buying this kindle version but it seems I'll have to go back to searching through used book stores.Although this is a negative review if it had been stated that this was only Volume I then I would have given it 5 stars just because of the value. I hope the remaining volumes are added to the kindle store soon."
4,This totally ROCKS! The New Sound Down Under,"I was put on to these guys by someone who saw them play in Sydney, Australia and said they were awesome. My friend gets into a lot of bands which I don't particularly like, me being more into DJs than live bands, but I can tell you, this isn't just some heavy riffin', Hip-Hop-Rock wannabee limp whiteguy music, this is the NEW SOUND. More energy than Silverchair, and better choons than Savage Garden, these aussie punks breathe new life into the rock world, mixing it up with some Chemical-styled beats and bleeps. They're obviously influenced by Hip-Hop, but they stay clear of the kind of stuff we've been fed on MTV for the last few years. My only critisim is that it takes 2 or 3 plays before you can really appreciate it. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen. For anyone who's into Biscit, Korn, Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, Appollo 440, Primal Scream, RATM, Beasties, or Public Enemy, give it a couple of listens.You won't be sorry!"
5,Has my favorite EJ song,"I am so addicted to ""The Last Song"" that I rarely listen to the rest of the tape. In fact, I've recorded it onto the beginning of another tape so that I can find the start of it easily and play it over and over while I'm driving. (I don't have a CD player in my car.)"
5,One Awesome Recording,"Although there are a lot of frillsy special effects, these special touches help make The One a quality release. And the Title Track is just so darn beautiful. Possibly one of Elton's best songs. Simple Man, Understanding Women, Runaway Train, and Dark Street are also strong cuts. Elton John is a quality artist and it is further proven here as well as on other releases as he can adapt to many changes in the music scene."
4,"Unsung hero, but no longer forgotten","This was a very good book of a player who shined briefly and has done something I don't think any other pitcher will ever do again: 2 STRAIGHT no hitters!!! Not in todays me first, I'm underpayed league. Its nice to see a that the author hasn't forgotten, and I think alot of other people can really get something out of this, other than just ""baseball"" information. Maybe some of todays players should read this to see what the game is all about."
2,Be Careful,"I have been inside this industry for a long time, and know athletic footwear. This insider's guide is a good primer, but be careful. It is not completely accurate, and there are some places where it will mislead you. However read it if you are interviewing, but to really find out about the company ask someone inside the industry to verify all that you read."
2,disappointed,"The book is like cliff notes, and if you do not know everything then you have to find the referenced items. I am not a doc and would prefer to have things written out for me. The info was good, but I had to dig a lot further for it."
2,This is a very old version of the book,"So much more current research. For my purposes, pretty much useless. Might be of historical value but wasn't what I needed."
3,ok book,the book is ok. not quite what i thought it would be inside. but im sure one day the information willbe useful.
2,disappointing,I found this CD to be a disappointment. I enjoy Bernadette Peter's work but this album was not up to the usual standard I have come to expect.The production on the album was poor and the quality of the songs was mediocre at best. The pace and phrasing of the album seemed off to me. The songs were all slow and lacking in emotion.Ms Peter's voice was excellent as always. However the passion or feeling behind the songs seemed to be lacking.Overall I would say the album is not up to Ms Peter's usual quality.
1,Where's the song Chico's Girl?,The song Chico's Girl is on the record so whythe heck didn't they put it on the CD?For whatever reason it stupid sucks!
1,Not worth their weight in scrap metal,"Bought a couple of these for a redwood salvage project figuring if I missed a nail and hit it with the blade, small loss. The blade dulled and died before I could test the nail theory. I then used an older carbide tipped blade that was about used up, it cut the wood better even after hitting a nail. Move along, nothing to buy here."
5,Mariah on Fire!,"Mariah is awesome in this DVD. With this collection of her #1 videos I can watch Mariah anytime I want to. She is a talented singer, and this DVD defenetly shows off her excellent work."
4,"Very good, but it was missing a few things","This was a very great collection of Mariah's videos, and I'm glad that she added on that Heartbreaker Remix; it's a great song! I was a little disapointed that some her first videos. such as ""Vision of Love,"" ""Someday,"" and ""Love Takes Time,"" were peformances, I would have really liked to have seen the videos. Some other things that Mariah was missing were her newest vidoes that were added on the #1's Cd, I would have liked to have seen those videos too! Even though the DVD was missing a few things, it was still a great buy! I encourage anyone who is trying to become a Mariah Carey fan, to buy this."
4,Mariah's Magical Videos,"In addition to being a fabulous vocalist, Mariah Carey has had some pretty awesome videos over the years. My favorites have to ""Emotions"" (she looks soooo beautiful in it), ""Dreamlover""(pretty farm setting, love the denim shorts), and the hilariously corny ""Heartbreaker"". I deducted one star for two reasons: 1) Why are half the vids life performances? I wanted to see the real ""Someday"" video!, and 2) the interviews with Mariah could of been a little more informative (she basically said the same thing in eack one). But this is nevertheless an essential DVD for all TRUE lambs."
5,Mariah is the best,"Mariah Carey is a true talent. The videos are hot, The singing is hot. A lot of artist today dont have the staying power like Mariah, they are package and sent out without much talent to start with."
5,For real fans,"This is an excellent dvd. It covers so many good songs and hits. I love them all. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was Whenever You Call being live. I don't usually like live music unless I'm at a concert, and I would have really loved to see a video for this. The music is fantastic even if the videos are somewhat corny (because this girl LOVES herself). Now she'd have a couple of more number 1's to add to this if it had been made now. Well that's OK. There will be more number 1's for a long time yet, so there can be another dvd collection of all the hits. If you are a true fan - go get this (if you don't already)."
3,Less than Expected,"For a singer as talented as she is and with the range and beauty that Mariah possess I was a little disappointed with this video. It was definately less than I expected. Nevertheless, if you like Mariah Carey, it's a decent video to have in a collection."
3,Video Collection,"Mariah's #1's DVD features 14 of her #1 hits, in video form. Its a nice collection, but I have a few faults with it. First, the original videos are missing. For a lot of them (esp. the early ones) we get live versions of the video, which is nice, but it would have been nice to have the original ones. Second, the DVD only features her videos for the songs that went to #1, what about all the other great videos she made? Like ""Butterfly"", ""Breakdown"", ""Anytime You Need A Friend"", etc, where are they? I realize its called #1's, but the whole idea seems rather dumb, especially since Sony just released their GH for Mariah, it would have been more fitting to scrap the whole #1's cd, VHS and DVD, and wait for that, because then it would be a more complete video collection. Hopefully one day fans are treated to a full collection of all her videos, but this is nice for the purpose it does serve, including her #1 videos."
4,mariah carey #1`s,it was not bad but they were a couple of songs wasn`t on this dvd. they are butterfly & endless love. over all it wasn`t a bad dvd music video.jd
2,I'll Pass,"Love Mariah Carey but this DVD really falls short. Videos for Vision Of Love, Love Takes Time and Someday are replaced by live performances found on her other DvDs.Didn't Sony release Greatest Hits and then Essential Mariah Carey? How about giving us the complete set of original videos done by Mariah during her tenure at Sony?In cases like these, patience is indeed a virtue."
2,video & tune NOT in sync,Mariah Carey is one of the best vocalist ever and the videos are really good.What makes this video bad is that the video and music do not sync. The video is behind about a half second so when you are watching it is irritating to see the mouth not syncing with the music.BAD RECORDING THAT IS. It just sucks to see a real good artist get ruined by bad recording.
3,Sequels (especially long-posted ones).,"""Crossover"" is the sequel to the Original Series episode, ""Mirror, Mirror."" Watch Kira's mirror universe double wear a lavender dress at a party for Kira. Watch as Odo's double, when he pulls out a phaser, Bashir shoots him, and he explodes into a million pieces, it looks gross for the first couple of times you watch it, and if you're an young adult or a teenager, it might even scare you. It certainly scared me! Also, watch as Sisko makes a belly laugh at Kira, and watch as Bashir does serious labor for the boss of ore processing. I tell you, it is just when the Cardassians made slaves of Bajorans in the ore processing center. Watch for what I mean when you watch ""Civil Defense."" My summary ends."
5,The bad transfer,"Yes, the DVD transfer for this magnificent film is atrocious. The result, unintentional of course, is a wabi-sabi quality all its own."
4,A Short and simple review,"A short and simple review:Gorgeous film. Takemitsu's score, blending Eastern and Western elements, is exceptional (the combination of sho and portative organ creates a single, morphing sound).The DVD transfer is HORRID."
5,The truth is a double cutting edge weapon !,The tea ceremony is the basis for this unforgettable and meticulous well made movie .The ancestral customs of this ritual will carry to this honest and simple man without any experience in the political world to be designed as the loyal adviser of the King due his weird prophecy gifts .But this gift will be the cause of his future tragedy when he predicts dark tempests in the future for the kingdom if the supreme authorities decide to initiate the war for territory concerns .Watch this wonderful and unforgettable film who will let astonished from start to end .A real masterpiece of the japanese cinema .
1,Heartbreakingly bad DVD transfer,"I remember seeing Rikyu in the theater, and it is a gem. The DVD transfer, however, is far and away the worst I have ever seen--so dark that frequently you cannot tell who is speaking, or even what characters are in the scene. So contrasty that all details in the shadows and highlights are washed out. The quality of the video distracts horribly from the story.Avoid this print. Eventually, they will have to produce a better one."
1,Worst ever-seen transfer to DVD,"It's a tragedy that this masterpiece of film art and narrative was totally destroyed by the poor transfer to the DVD by Slingshot. I should have read Amazon's previous reviews about this DVD, and then I whould have not bought it. I orderd this DVD version because I admired the film when it was originally shown in a theater. Don't buy this DVD, period."
2,Never trust Slingshot DVD again!,"After purchasing ""Academy Award Winner, the frist 50 years"" ( a ""0"" star DVD ) and this DVD ( ""2"" star ), I have lost my confidence with Slingshot (Triton) I will think twice with any DVD with this label. The film itself is a great one (4 stars)."
2,Very poor DVD quality,"Two stars refer to DVD quality. It is a very good film but DVD quality is not.The DVD quality is exactly the same as previous LD which is very poor. The studio just copied the whole things including English subtitle ( not removable ) from LD to this new DVD. The picture quality is so fuzzy, dark and grainy that you can hardly see much of this great film. The DVD quality of ""Woman in the Dunes"" from the same director is much nicer. This movie deserves a better DVD transfer."
5,Good bargain,"For the small amount I paid for this it was a great buy. I plan to replace the toilet in the spring, so I didn't want to spend a lot - this does the job, looks good and will hold me over very nicely for the next few months."
5,Absolutely enchanting and inspirational,"Sunchyme has been used extensively in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Swimming Trials. The Afro style beat and rhythm was so appropriate for the occasion - so uplifting, I could dance and listen to it all day. Great music for aerobics too."
4,The All-Moods Single,"No matter what mood you're in Sunchyme will pick you up and shake you by the collar. A great upbeat, uplifting single from a brand-new group. Although the album Sunmachine can't quite compare, this is definitely the best of what they have to offer. The Radio Edit and Original Mixes are well worth the price and Sasha's Remix also kicks out a big dancefloor-rattling groove. Prince Quick Mix's mix is a bit too repetitve and not melodic enough to make it in my books, but the other tracks make this a disc well worth playng if you're in a low mood."
3,An improvement over the last two...,"We've had two of these and ordered another only because it matches all the other hardware in the room. They improved the design somewhat by making the part that holds the bottle all one piece instead of several smal ones, which sofar seems much sturdier. We'll see..."
3,under the bridge,"i thought it would be the single song, under the bridge. the other songs i didn't like., so i bought the cdfor the sing under the bridge."
4,Great movie music,"This movie is great, and the music is also wonderful. The arrangements are by Andre Previn, a great composer and conductor, and I always enjoy the combination of Julie Andrews and Mr. Previn."
3,"DVD, PLEASE!!!","Sure there are people who still wondering when the DVD version of ""The Producers"" will be out, but, there are also people who worried when Universal is going to release the original 1967 movie version on DVD. I rather see that over the CD release anytime!"
5,A Feast For The Hungry,"I've loved Vollenweider's music since the '80's, but never saw him perform and always wondered about the man behind that beautiful music. This gives me a chance to connect with the music and Vollenweider's aesthetic sensibility like I never have before. He is an extraordinary artist, and to watch him create is a real treat."
2,poor sound for perfect music,I am very disapointed on the sound quality. The sound level is fluctuating
3,You get what you pay for,It is so much better than nothing.The fact that no batteries will ever be needed is a real plus.If there is a flaw in the design it was the odd size battery in theillumination device attached.I have purchised 3 of these now and plan to always keep one on hand.
3,Eh....,"Should've saved my money for at least a 2nd generation.This device works OK, and doesn't require batteries (at least for the intensifier--the illuminator still requires a battery), but unless you're searching for something around your feet, well, you might consider spending a but more."
1,utterly reprehensible,"shamefully bad, voyeuristic in the worst imaginable way, and without the slightest respect or attention to known historical detail.it's not only bad if you're a student of the lincoln conspiracy, it's bad as a piece of fiction, period. i'm embarrased for the writers of this book."
1,Title likely to be inaccurate,"Nancy Barr Mavity wrote a book called The Tule Marsh Murder,pub: Grossett & Dunlap,NY c. 1928. I do not have any record of her writing a book called ""The True Marsh Murder"" at any time during her rather prolific career. Please provide additional references and/or citation to verify the ""True Marsh Murder"" work.Thanks."
5,This truly is one of his very best!,"Of the 45 or more OST CDs by John Williams in my collection, this one includes some of the most different, interesting and simply enjoyable music composed by him. The Chieftains add their contemporary flavor, and Enya's ""Book of Days"" is superb! This is not just mood music a la ""Nixon"" or ""The Lost World,"" but music obviously spent quite some time on by John Williams. It's near the top of my most-played albums in all of my collection."
3,One of JW's weaker efforts,"Far and Away satisfies one's musical want but goes no further, unlike most of JW's soundtracks. It might have been written by James Newton Howard."
5,The essential Buffett collection,This boxed set is the one most required for a parrot head. All of his best are included. I recommend it for new and old fans alike.
5,Life doesn't get any better than this!,"Life doesn't get any better than this - Buffet, boats, bars and ballads! Okay, so it's missing ""youth"" and ""beauty"" but hey, it's all just attitude anyway! Love it!"
2,Great Music - but nothing new,"The very best anthologies provide alternative and / or new versions of bets-known songs as well as new, never-before released songs along with live cuts. This collection would have benefited from all of these. The songs are great. Buy it if you dont't have any or many Buffett CDs. Just don't expect anything new."
4,Gotta give him his due,"Whether you like the man or not you have to give him this much. He found a unique niche in the music world and made it his own. Very few artists have done that so well. He's no joke, his music can stand on its own. It's just that he was humble enough to realize his own limitations and not try to remake himself into what the BIZ wanted him to be. He has a good time with his art and he makes people happy. I remember seeing him at the coffee shop in the North Texas student union building in 1971 when he was just a solo act with a guitar and a mike. He was one of the best entertainers I've ever seen. This is great music to listen to while you cruise. Not all of them are gems, but I dare you not to start singing along when ""Volcano"" or ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" comes on. This is a celebration of a good guy who did it right."
5,The Buffett Bible of Songs,"For any human that likes Jimmy this is a must. It has almost every song you need to hear. I have only been a Buffett fan for about 4 yrs. then again I'm only 21. This was my fist Buffett CD/CDs and they are my favorite. Buy it, read the handbook that comes with it, and use the directions on how to make a margarita pop in the CDs and listen."
5,Jimmy's greatest triumph,"I totally recommend this for anyone who has heard about Jimmy and wants to jump right in, and to all you Parrotheads out there! This is what Buffett is all about."
5,I WAS IN MANANA!!!,"I've been listening to Buffett all my life (we Gulf Coasters have to stick together) and found myself in the song ""Manana"" recently. As I'm sailing out of Cane Garden Bay (in the BVI) with a bottle of Callwood's rum in the boat with the lights of St. Thomas 20 miles west....WOW! I never get tired of these CDs and carry them with me wherever I go...essential for Buffett fans who want a great variety of his songs!"
5,"If you own only one Buffett CD, this should be it !","Of course, no one can own just one. While many parrotheads argue about ""missing"" songs this is a super, super collection. The recording quality is superb (which is a great boon to those of us who own the vinyl originals.) Its well worth the investment. It contains all of what Jimmy calls "" the play or get killed songs"" from his concerts.Just imagine kicking in any of these CD's, close your eyes and you're sitting back on a lounge chair with powder sand under your feet and Carribean blue water ahead !"
5,Parrothead Paradise,"If you are looking for a wide variaty of Jimmy Buffett, this is the answer. I've looked at different cds that offer good songs, but their always seems to be somethings missing. This cd gathers many of his works and puts them into a 4cd set that takes a lot of the guesswork out of buying some parrothead music. The 4 cds are broken up into different themes, which helps to avoid over swapping cds which can get annoying. If you are new to Buffett, this is a sure way to find something you like. I am sure there are some personal favorites missing for some of the long time listeners, but I had no complaints and I recommend this package to anyone searching for their own margaritaville in music."
4,Best of the Best,"Tired of trying to arm-wrestle your buddy with the CD burner into making your own personal Best Of CD? This box set is definitely worth the money, though some of JB's better cuts got left off somehow."
4,first hand,"i am in this book as well and would like to say that the demographic that it covers is indeed accurate and diverse. i attended anne's booksigning for ""violin"" just minutes after i attended my own at britton trice's store. anne herself asked if our intentions were pure by participating in this conglomeration, and i assured her that we were sincere indeed. she read and embraced the book, and that's all the proof i need. it was a pleasure being involved with jana and the others back in '96 and '97; truly an experience that i will forever cherish."
1,Only the Wierdos...,"I am a die hard Anne Rice fan, and an insurance executive. To pick up a book that purports to be written about her fans, and see only the bloodsuckers, goths and sub/doms was not a real picture of who her fans are.Anne Rice's fans are moms and dads, teenagers, and goths. Her fans probably represent every single type of person in the world. She receives fan mail from Catholic priests, as well as those who want to become immortal. Doctors, lawyers and waitresses read Sleeping Beauty. Anne Rice has become mainstream - her work is not on the fringe of anything and neither are most of her fans.So, my opinion was that the fans that were interviewed and published in the book attempted to put limits on a woman's work whose appeal is absolutely limitless."
4,A great start to a new way of thinking,"This book resulted from a think tank on the nature of use-oriented design representations and the part they play in the development of computer systems and applications. Enter scenario-based design. The book is made up of a number of essays - each with their own spin on the idea and their own examples of its application. While this makes the content a little hard to access, it also offers a rich resource and food-for-thought. Of particular interest to me was the relation of scenario-based design to object oriented design and HCI principles and practices. A must for serious designers who want to explore ways of creating systems that better serve users."
2,Scenario based design,The book is a good exploration of new way understanding user's experience. Many guru from HCI join to write the books such as Allan Maclean(his design rationale QOC). This book seems to be good but they are fail to understand what user's need. This is a representation of failure. Many authours try to take the technology based and change their title to scenario.
4,Finally ... visit Ferenginar!,"FAMILY BUSINESS is a wonderful tale of sibling rivalry coupled with an exploration of Ferengi culture on the homeworld. When Quark's mother (played wonderfully by SCTV's Andrea Martin) is charged with violating Ferengi law by making a profit, Quark is forced to face a homeworld and a family truth that he's avoided for 20 years. An outstanding performance by Max Grodenchik (sp?) as Rom, in particular, makes this a standout episode where family is explored with the backdrop of the truest sense of capitalism ... if there ever was one!"
4,Low budjet-old skool,"This video seems to be shot in early 80's. It ok. Has 3 female models and 1 male model doing exercises. Video quality could be better, and could have better shots like the nude yoga series. Buy it used."
4,"Good quality, but fits smaller adult",The quality of the mask and jacket were good but would fit a smaller adult. Also the mask is hard to see through.
3,Wish the resistance band was longer,"I like most of the Core Fusion DVD's, but the arm and ab segment involving the resistance band was awkward for me, even after a few tries.I think the problem for me was the length of the resistance band needed to properly do some of the exercies. You do get a free resistance band with the DVD, but it wasn't long enough..to remedy it, I bought another resistance band and use them together."
2,boring and awkward,"I like the weight part of the DVD for the arms, other than that, I'm not impressed. The resistance band is awkward to use with the ab exercises and it kept moving around. There are much better fitness DVDs you can get."
1,Not Worth It...,"This DVD was not worth the money you pay. You don't get anything out of the workouts (and I'm not anywhere near being in great physical shape) and they're difficult to follow. When you do follow along with the moves its hard to tell if the moves were actually a part of the workout itself or if you were still in the warm-up/stretching phase. If you're looking to feel like you've gotten something out of a workout and want to push yourself, look elsewhere. I purchased the 30 day shred along with this and it's kicking my butt."
3,Women scientists,I found this book fasanating because it tells about a woman going through not only the hardships of being a woman in the 1800's but also being a jewish woman during the time of Hitler. She was still able to overcome all of these odds and help in establishing nuclear fussion.
2,You gotta really like Punk music!,"Be warned... the love of the greatest sport on earth is not enough to warrant the purchase of this cd! There are a couple good ones on this disc... but I literally mean 2, maybe 3 songs tops. Ive taken my turn with bands like MXPX, Less Than Jake, Rancid, Bad Religion, etc - this disc is nothing like any of that stuff. I dont want to completely bash the rest of the music, but aside from ""One Timer"", ""Billy Zamboni"" and the comical ""Hockey Hair"" song... it is apparent why youve never heard of these bands elsewhere!One day there will be a solid soundtrack to practice to - in the meantime, this is not an acceptable substitute!"
4,Great Spacesaving Organizer,"I got two of these to hold my scrapbooking paper. I did have them in plastic bins but needed to save space and these work perfectly. I don't know how much paper is in each one, but they are stuffed full (I'm sure more than what is recommended) and they still close easily. Since I can stand them up, they don't take nearly as much space and the bins. The only somewhat negative thing I would say is the plastic is really thin, especially the dividers, so I wondered as I was filling them how long it would last. But, I really like these!"
3,Advantus Cropper Hopper,"The plastic is sturdy, however it is very difficult to organize or use papers. The base doesn't stand up very well. You have to clip the top back so it doesn't get in your way when you are loading or removing papers."
5,3.36?!? BUY IT!,"I cant believe that people are selling this set for less then five bucks. I've never seen a show go that low before. The Kids in the Hall is probably the best sketch comedy group since Monty Python. The five guys in Kids in the Hall all have something unique and funny about them. I dont like Mark McKinney to much but I like the rest of the guys. Yes I know I dont like Chicken Lady, Blues Guy, or Im Crushing Your Head Guy. My favorite sketchs on this set are Banker and The Eradicator!. Both star McCulloch and are probably the funniest pieces of comedy ive seen in a long time. I also enjoyed Kevin McDonald in the surprise sketch. Whatever you do, buy this set now! You'll have a good laugh and wont be disappointing shelling out 6 dollars for an amazing set."
5,Fun Fun Fun!,"This is an awesome debut of the KTH series. The sketches are very thought out, and really show a unique talent for these ""kids"". My favorites are ""Cathy Strupp and Kathie Lassiter"", ""Darci"", ""Stinky Pink"" and let us Not forget ""Buddy Cole"" boy!"
5,Hi Larious!,Missed the old crew from my child hood. Their skits haven't lost a step. Amazing Dave miss that guy. Pure 90's comedy!
3,"""I used to love this show.""","My wife and I were talking about this show and I mentioned how funny I thought it was back in the day. Without much planning I ordered this, it was a great bargain ($6.00 total). I did watch this all the way thrue in one day, but it would probably be a while before I got it out again. I appreciate good sketch comedy so this was entertaining. It's something that's better in small doses, not three hours at a time. All in all, if you were a fan of the show it's worth the price."
1,HP DVD BLANK MEDIA IS JUNK,"I had 100 disc spindle of HP DVD discs and ended up with greater than 50% duds/coasters. I thought maybe I had a bad lot until I read lots of other reviews on other websites that indicated a high failure rate with HP discs. I like HP. I just bought a very highend HP desktop PC with the AMD 1090 six core processor fully loaded. I, however, will not buy HP bland media to use my two HP PC's again."
5,Great product!,"I have ordered from Amazon for years now and this is the ""first"" time I have ever received a product with a problem...so far the product is fine, however, in packing the bubble wrap was busted and the container that held the DVD's was busted and loose in the box when it arrived at my door...other than that they seem to work well. HP DVD-R 4.7GB 16x Inkjet-Printable 100 Spindle (DMJPW045)"
1,My 75 out of 100 pack,"I have used the standard non-printable single-layer HP discs for years and have found them extremely reliable, so decided to give the printable ones a try. In the center of my 100 stack, there were 25 with the recording surface chipped, scratched, and gouged. They had obviously been damaged during the manufacturing process and I was the unlucky recipient of the machine hiccup and lack of quality control. I don't appreciate it one little bit. What were they thinking, letting these get out the door? These DVD's sure won't be going through any of my doors again."
4,Good product,"I bought an Epson RX680 printer, then started shopping for printable DVDs. This HP is the first I've tried and I selected it because HP is pretty reliable and this was the best unit cost I could find, because other sources charge for shipping. I'm getting beautiful print jobs with this printer and these discs. I've printed about 50 so far. One of the discs was defective on the ""burn"" side, so 4 stars."
5,HP quality as expected,HP continues to produce a high quality product as expected. Not one coaster and the printing surface produces an excellent image. Thank you Amazon for another great product at a great price!
4,"good item, good price","these are good, they have failed less than other brands ive tried so far, the print surface takes well. the only thing i wish is that i could take advantage of the fact that even the inner ring of the disc that is typically clear plastic is covered in printable surface, but this is no fault of the disc but of my printer. ;)"
5,good DVD,I am making a promotional DVD for m small business and it failed just 1out of 100 which is exceptionally good
4,Product Appears Bigger on Screen,"Althought I do love this product, it did lead me to believe by the pic. that they were larger strips. READ THE DESCRIPTIONS PEOPLE!!! That is all I have to say about that. I would Order again because I DO use these successfully and they do the job. but I usually like larger pieces I can cut to shape and size myself."
2,Muslin Strips,"Too small to really accomplish anything. Although, they grip the wax andhair very well."
1,Terrible!,"My daughter just received this as a birthday gift. We set it up and went through the how to play and practice sections, then tried out the performance setting. Altogether, it held her interest for maybe 10 minutes. The other reviewer was correct, all you can do is step on the appropriate flower and watch the corresponding Barbie on-screen do her little dance. Your child doesn't do any dancing. There isn't even a 'Simon' type mode. Avoid this toy, it's not worth the time/money."
1,VERY not fun TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This games is no fun its not even in the form of dance mat you step on a flower and and watch one of the princesses dance Its not fun.
2,i didnt like it as i was very disappointed,Wasnt at all what i thought it would be sorryvery hard to try n understand the game graphics werent good either
5,One of the Greatest RPGs Ever.,"Not only is this one of my favorite RPG's of all time, it's also one of the best Dungeons and Dragons to game translations I've ever seen. It's got most everything, even -tumble-. Not only that, but the storyline is interesting, and the addons are amazing. Honestly, I think the Hordes of the Underdark addon was better than the original NWN, but the entirety of it was amazing. It's been a few years since I've played it as I got a new computer, but I can't wait for my new copy to arrive and get into it again. Much like Morrowind, it has infinite replay value."
3,A Bit Buggy,"Should the game be minimized for any reason (my anti-virus running an automatic check, for instance), the original NWN freezes, but the expansions don't. Tends to run slow in a few of the largest areas, since it was on a laptop, I'll admit my system may have been at least partially to blame.XP1 had a few points, especially in the interlude, where puzzels lacked explaination and solving them proved very difficult, but they were always very inconsequential sidequests.I did notice in the last chapter of XP2, the game froze five or six times, especially in the deepest wastes portion. All other problem I had involved my own lack of sitting down and thinking a riddle or puzzel through, so I have no other complaints. The story telling's great, the game's top notch,and I realyl love to play it again adn again and again."
2,"A lot of content, but ultimately clunky","The Dungeons and Dragons features and game engine are impressive and well-done. Unfortunately, the game is noticeably clunky and ultimately could not hold my interest past 2 playing sessions. The gameplay is just too slow."
2,For Fallout Fans,"THIS IS FOR FALLOUT FANS ONLY!if you are a fallout fan, and looking for games like fallout.this is Not a similar game too fallout. so beware befor buying.i have this game and i am not satisfied with it."
3,Just ok,"First of all, these are NOT anything like the Hikari waffers I usually feed my plecostomus. They are very tiny, maybe the size of my pinkie nail (I'm a woman with small hands) rather than the large waffers that are closer to my thumb nail in size. They also resemble kibble more than they do algea waffers I've used in the past (small brownish nuggets verses flat green waffers). I tossed some in my tank but none of my bottom feeders seemed very interested in them but I'll wait and seem if they change their mind once they get hungrier.Bottom line: I cancelled my subscribe and save order and will go back to Hikari. Sure, they're more expensive but they seem to be of better quality and my fish seem to like them."
2,Going back to TetraVeggie,"Bought these when the price on my usual TetraVeggie Algae Wafers doubled while I was waiting to complete my order, but these don't cut it. They're half the diameter of TetraVeggie, twice as thick, looser in composition and they don't sink very well. I never find an uneatenTetra Veggie, but I have found uneaten Wardley's."
5,Our trapdoor snails love these!,"I bought these discs for our mollies, but it turned out the snails liked them a whole lot more! I dropped one algae disc in to see it they were a hit or not... and it just laid there for hours. However, when I awoke the next morning, there were my two black jumbo Japanese trapdoor snails eating away at the algae buffet. It was kind of cute, almost as if they were cuddling. Actually, I think the larger one was trying to hoard it all to him/herself--but I can't say for sure."
3,Mmmm...not bad.,"Rochelle certainly has a good voice, I'll give her that. But perhaps Konami shouldn't have picked this song for DDR 5th Mix."
3,simple but engaging,"Sisko builds a ship. The man and his boy do some bonding. Dukat has a cameo. That's about it. Yet somehow ""Explorers"" winds up being a nice little character piece with an air a serenity about it that showcases the genuine affection between the two Siskos. This is one of the handful of episodes that captures the two characters together and actually does a little something with it. Not much really, but enough to make for a pleasant hour."
2,Don't explore this!,"In an attempt to prove that Ancient Bajoran's did leave their solar system, Commander Sisko builds a simple starship like the ones used by the Bajoran's and he and Jake set-off. A rather dull episode that concentrates on the relationship between both Sisko's, although some engaging subjects arise and more about Bajor is discovered, the cracking dialogue and pace is too irratic to watch in full."
1,Very Weak,The music and drum machine sound like a poorly made home recording with a cheap organ sound included. This is really poor material. I do not understand the other reviews - listened to this twice- and in disbelief threw it out. Maybe I missed something?
5,Jenney Beyer's books,I ordered this book just to get one pattern I wanted that was a Jenny Beyer pattern.I love the book as such a good review for hand piecing and quilting. She is an excellent quilter and equally as well a good writer and easy to follow her directions. For hand quilters her books are a must. I was delighted to find it still available and at a great price.
1,not worth buying,doesnt pull the hair out. they are just normal paper. Nair hair removal has better quality of hair removal strips.
5,Singer 120 Stitch Super Value Super Product,"I am so happy to have this new machine. My old one did not have nearly the functions that this one has. It runs very smoothly and quietly. This machine is top notch and a bargain at the price. The many different stitches are very nice, but my favorite is the automatic button hole function! It sews beautifully and would be great for any seamstress to use."
3,Escuche a una soprano extraordinaria.,"Si bien la obra no es brillante, calificando a la autora, (Leonarda), la soprano Loredana Bacchetta fue la razon por la que compre el disco. La obra no permite apreciar a Loredana en todo su extraordinario esplendor. Loredana debe ser un angel que se escapo del cielo y llego a la tierra para deleitar a las almas de la tierra, con su voz divina. La grabación es tecnicamente buena, sin ser extraordinaria. Tiene un especial valor en el sentido de representar un documento historico de una region de Italia. Continuaré buscando otras grabaciones de Loredana Bacchetta. Atte. Benjamin Verdessi Belemmi"
1,Dangerous Shoes,These shoes were fairly useless. My feet continued to hurt and didnt feel like the cur of my foot had any extra support at all. Also while dancing I slipped on the dance studio's floor and almost hurt my ankle. I wish there was some way to provide traction without losing their functionality as dance shoes. I am very scared now every time I slip these on for my classes. Maybe I should just continue the hunt. Oh btw I have barely used them 4 times or so...its not like I danced them to baldness or something...
3,Where are the great pictures?,"I can read about the legends, traditions and a very interesting history. For a visual person, there is only the front cover to see. I gave this book to a new Freshman soon to arrive at Notre Dame. Will he ever read this? My bet is that he would rather go to the Notre Dame vs. Michigan football game!"
1,Disappointing,"Don't waste your time or your money on this film. Trust the detailed negative reviews provided on this site. I can only assume the positive comments were written by someone affiliated with the film to get their ""star"" rating up. Could have been so good, the result was unfortunate."
1,A pointless film,"Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela did a good job and all, but this film was painful to watch. The storyline was boring boring boring. I could not wait for it to end. The scenery is beautifully and the cinematography is not bad, but the plot is pointless."
1,boring and meaningless,"Although the running of the bulls was interesting, the torture and killing of one of them was pointless and barbaric. Since the plot or storyline was a big fat zero, it was meaningless to have included the scenes. The characters behaved stupidly and were not believable. The one star is for the scenery and photography. Sorry, that's the best I could do."
3,arrived broken,a nice bed. my 2 yr old son loves it. a piece that holds the drawer was broken off so i had to alter it. but other than that its ok.
3,autofocus?,Advertised as an autofocus. Product description indicates that this is a manual focus lens. Appears to be a very good and fast lense for this price even though it's probably a manual focus.
5,Tom Green is the funniest guy alive...,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the crazy stuff that Tom does, although if you're not a Tom Green fan or don't have the crazy sense of humor that he, I, and so many others have, you probably wouldn't like it."
5,Tom Green Rules!,"Watch this video! If you've missed some of Tom's earlier shows on MTv, this is a must see! If your a die hard fan and want all the Tom Green you can get, get this video! There is no funnier comic right now than Tom, and if you've never seen anything by him, YOU'RE MISSING OUT! GET IT!"
2,Very little on this tape,"The tape was funny, but there are only like 10 shows on it, maybe a hour's worth of material. I feel they could have least put 25 to 30 shows on the tape, esp. for $12.99."
4,An interesting biography,"This is a fascinating biography about adventure-seeking John Jewitt. John Jewitt traveled with traders to the West Coast before it was settled. His captivity by the native tribes is described based on a journal he kept for many years during the ordeal. His descriptions of the lifestyle of these natives opened the eyes of the world to this rich culture and helped many to understand the hostility that was encountered by some of the captains and their crew.Shannon Garst has an interesting way of capturing the action in this biography. Although it is written for younger or teen readers, it is an interesting and informative account."
3,"Good start, could be improved","This book contains very good information and is useful. It could be improved by adding an index, giving page numbers for specific techniques mentioned in the table of contents, and giving written descriptions of how to find the points. It is not possible to precisely pinpoint the acupuncture/pressure spot with just the dot on a dog diagram. There are some typos that should have been caught by the publisher. Over-all a useful book. I hope they come out with an updated edition that particularly contains an index."
5,ACCUPRESURE,"OUR LAB MIX DOG (MERLIN) SUFFERED A SPINAL EMBOLISM AND WAS PARALIZED IN THE REAR RIGHT LEG, GOT HIM TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY TO GET STEROIDS AND ANTI-INFLAMATORIES ON BOARD, DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST PROGNOSIS. ORDERED THIS BOOK AND BEGAN WITH THE ACCUPRESURE AND MASSAGE 3 X A DAY. HE HAS MADE A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY IN ONLY 8 WEEKS WITH ABOUT 85% USE OF THE LEG. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BOOK REALLY HELPED AND IT IS EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOUR DOG, DON'T GIVE UP, WE ALMOST DID AND ARE SO GLAD NOW THAT WE DIDN'T."
3,Very good guide,The dogs are a bit confused as I practice on them but it is clear enough that I can feel confident I won't harm them as I learn accupressure. I may never be a pro from this book but I hope to relieve some of their aches and pains in the years to come. I have seen some online material as good or better but this is simpler while sitting on the floor with the dog.
2,Layout is very difficult,Lack of an index makes this book difficult for the reader. Trying to find specific points is also challenging due to the graphics used. I l was surprised to find so many typos which should have been caught before print.
4,Good guidance,It's always best to know what you can do for your dog and this provides information you can have on hand and use.
3,NO INDEX!!,All books of this kind need to have an index so that one does not have to re-read and hunt all over the book to find info. Cannot recommend!
2,"Uneven, at best","The story of Bareil's gradual slipping away, coupled with a political backstory, is shoddily handled throughout, leaving the end result nothing more than an episode wherein it might appear that a great cameo actor asked to written out of the Trek continuity. While Nana Visitor's performance is outstanding, it's not enough to lift this single-hanky story out of the doldrums to stand with integrity alongside the far superior TNG's THE INNER LIGHT, TOS's CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER, or DS9's THE VISITOR. Close, but no cigar."
2,Too Touchy Feely,"If you are not the touchy feely type, then this book will make your skin crawl. It has ""cute"" chapter titles, like ""Rally Round The Boob"" and tidbits such as ""The Lumpectomy Dance.""If you want a helpful, not silly, book, I recommend ""Just Get Me Through This"" instead. I also felt the writing was very self-congratulatory. Again, I understand cancer is a horrible disease and everyone's approach to dealing with it is going to be different. But this book is not for the serious minded or for anyone seeking detailed information about treatment."
1,Frank Thorne's thoughts: Bad reproduction ruins a classic,"Here is a quote about these Dynamite reprints of the Red Sonja books from Frank Thorne himself: ""My Sonja was raped by a computer! The line work that I labored over those years breaks up, and looks like it was spattered with ink. I'm not comfortable with computer coloring; it's too gaudy and slick. The technicians try to model the form, but it seldom is convincing. Stick with the original series folks.""I couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, this awful trend continues, as more and more comic art that was never intended to be computer colored is ruined by the gaudy, slick, unconvincing attempts to model form. Thorne nails it on the head, and his words could be used to describe the coloring on the new EC Archives, as well as many other such projects."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This ain't the Frazetta Sonja, that is for sure. Still, entertaining She-Devil slayage. She is far more pneumatically inflated, and it is a bit hard to imagine the lithe deadly warrior, famed for her blinding speed dragging this around, so to speak. However, it definitely looks good, which, in this case is the cheesecake point, no doubt about it. Stories are solid, hard, pragmatic warrior tales as well."
1,disappointing,"This series started out promising (if a bit wooden), but they have not gotten better. The author seems to have a set formula to make the same points about the Irish judicial system in each book (interesting, but phrased like a law school lecture). Instead of developing his characters he spends lots of time and words describing how they snub each other, jockeying for social status. The plots are less and less believable with each new book - this book's plot is as contorted as an advanced yoga position. And despite the female / feminist protagonist, the plots themselves are misogynist; of course there are and were female evildoers, but as the main villain in each book? In this one he ignores the greater social evils he's spent alot of time developing to settle in the end for a sensational baddie out of a _National Enquirer_ ""news"" story. ..."
3,Not Her Best.,"Of all the Eva Cassidy cd's, Time After Time is the weakest though this is no fault of Eva. She sings gloriously and without fault. But when compared to classic's like Eva By Heart, it starts to show its flaws.On Eva By Heart, each song was crafted to perfection by the producer and her fellow musicians as they sought to pay tribute to her life and her art. The result is one of the most moving works of our time.By contrast, Time After Time seems slapped together with very little embellishment. Just make sure the vocals sound o.k. and let her go.If you like simple, girl with a guitar kind of music, you might enjoy it. But if you want to hear a great CD, try Eva By Heart."
4,Can't believe I chose to work the night I could've seen her!,Kathy's Song brings me to tears. I had heard of Eva when I lived in D.C. from 1994- and am sorry now that I missed seeing her at Blues Alley when I had the chance. I realize this is all quite bittersweet for her parents and her friends.
5,Time After Time,WHAT CAN I SAY ANYTHING BY EVA CASSIDY IS JUST HEART WARMING..I LOVE THE SONG WAY BEYOUND THE BLUE...SHE IS FROM MY HOME STATE..IT IS JUST A GREAT LOST TO THE MUSIC WORLD..EVA'S VOICE WAS MUSIC TO ANY ONE'S EARS...WE MISS HER SO MUCH..I HOPE THAT SOME MORE OF HER MUSIC WILL BE RELEASED SOON.....
5,Absolutely Spectacular,"I stumbled onto this album while clicking around here one day,listened to a few snippets and ordered Time After Time. I am simplyfloored by this woman's talent and saddened by her early death. The music is truly wonderful and Ms. Cassidy has such a uniquely strong, beautiful voice. This album is evocative of a lot of music I love, but somehow better. We've all heard most of these songs before, but she takes them to another plane. Her version of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time is haunting, as is Paul Simon's Kathy's Song (and pretty much every other song on this album.) If you can, listen to the songs Amazon.com provides, if you like them, buy the album, you will love it."
4,Very Sweet,"I have always listened attentively whenever a selection by this very talented musican came over the radio; however, it wasn't until I heard Cassidy's redition of Paul Simon's ""Kathy's Song"" on a folk music station that I finally bought a the CD that included that song. Cassidy's interpretation of a wide range of genres on this CD---from Irish folk ballad to pop to blues---is truly phenomenal and her delivery of all of them is as smooth as silk. That cancer took her young life is truly tragic, but her memory and angelic voice lives on in these beautiful songs."
5,A music lover's dream!,"Time After Time is a testiment to the remarkable talent of Eva Cassidy. This was the third Eva Cassidy album I bought and left me wanting more!! I believe that this is the best album.it starts off with a quickly picked version of Paul Simon's ""Kathy's Song"" followed by a bluesy ""Ain't no sunshine"".Once you listen as far as ""Time after Time""you are hooked.The emotional ""I wandered by the brookside"" shows off Eva's crisp, clear voice. She also does a version of Joni Mitchell's ""Woodstock"" which comes late on in the album.The album finishes with a gospel sounding track ""Way beyond the blue"".Listening to this album, one would wonder how a woman with such aa diverse voice and an obvious talent found it sodifficult to get a record contract!Remarkable!top tracks: ""Time after Time"", ""I wandered by the brookside"", ""Woodstock""."
5,Somewhere Over The Rainbow,I first became aware of Eva Cassidy recently when I saw a story about her life on ABC's Nightline. I have been an avid fan ever since. Her voice is absolutely crystal clear and haunting. I only wish I could have heard her in person. Her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is absolutely riveting. I listen to it daily and never tire of listening to her voice. I am so glad her voice and music live on.
5,You cannot really rate talent like this...,"It is just beyond words the way the sound of this singer's voice affects the listener. The feeling, depth, range, purity and magnitude is unsurpassed by any other performer - in any genre, in any era. Eva had a spirituality that flowed so naturally from her that the listener has no choice but to be profoundly affected."
5,AWESOME!!,LOVE LOVE LOVE her voice!! LOVE LOVE LOVE Eva!! Angel from heaven for sure! OMGOSH!! BEST Singer!! She was soooo blessed and now so am I for having listened!!
3,The Well's Starting to Dry Up,"First, Eva's voice is a one-of-a-kind original. The problem is the quality of the material is not as good as her other CDs. I like time after time, but thats the only stand out. Usually, there are about 5 standouts on her CDs."
2,"Great Voice, Little Else","After reading for years about Eva, I finally took the plunge and purchased this CD - - fully expecting to be blown away. As I listened, track after track passed by and I kept saying to myself ""OK, the next song will be great."" Well, sorry to say, I found nothing here very special at all. Granted, Eva was blessed with a beautiful voice. But that's not all it takes to pull the listener in. I'm familar with most of the songs on this CD, but her versions don't add anything unique. Her band is just OK and the recording quality of this CD is pretty bleak. I just don't see what all the fuss is about and was greatly dissapointed."
1,Big Disappointment,"Having purchaced this CD after reading rave reviews, I found it greatly disappointing. Her voice, while very good, simply lacks soul. There's a technical perfection without the heart of the music. It's lacking that emotionally-felt dimension that could carry it from being merely good to great. Save your money on this one, or be sure to give it a good listen before buying."
5,MUST HAVE CD FOR YOUR COLLECTION,This is the third in a series of cd's i've purchased from this great artist.The others being Songbird and Live at Blues Alley. I continued to be amazed at the feelings she brings to these songs.The title cut Time after Time is now her song.It must have been amazing to see her create her own interpretation of a song. Lyrics are justs words on a piece of paper but she knew how to bring them to life like no one else could.Her version of Woodstock is haunting.Add this CD to the list of Must Have CD's in a your Eva Cassidy Collection.
5,Awesome Singer with Such emotion,I saw a story about Eva on TV. I was hooked right there. I bought 4 of her CDs. This is the first one. Wow!! What emotions and such a beautiful voice. Touched me to the depths of my soul and beyond! Eva is up in Heaven singing with the best!! Thanks Eva for leaving us with your beautiful angelic and soulful songs. You are not forgotten!!
3,Not too impressed,"It's a good looking bag but i was a little disappointed w/ the quality of the bag. The bag seems to be made of low quality material, it seems as it will not last for a long time."
4,Perfect Compact Drill Set,"You can't go wrong on this drillset ... especially if you find it at the promotional price.Once I used one of the bits, I realized that this was a bargain!Craig"
5,Odo is falling apart - again!,"The great season three of Deep Space Nine is coming to a close with only a handful of episodes left, this action packed outing is worth every penny. Garak is interrogating Odo by using a Romulan device that prevents him from returning to liquid form, something that soon becomes torture as Odo's body desperately needs regeneration. In the meantime the Federation gets wind of the Romulan-Cardassian plot to enter the Gamma Quadrant and attack the Founder's homeworld, striking a deadly blow to the evil Dominion! Great battle sequences make this one an intelligent story with a classic ending..."
4,"LESS than the first, but MORE than just your average DS9","Second-part episodes have the dubious distinction of holding the momentum set forth in the first installment. ""Die"" tries but just isn't as good, although the actors make a valiant effort to keep the story strong. Rene Auberjonois, Andrew Robinson, and Paul Dooley are again brilliant in their respective roles. The special effects crew gets a chance to shine when an all-out Dominion attack surprises the Cardassian-Klingon Alliance.And the reminder that ""no changeling has ever harmed another"" comes from a surprising source"
4,Wake Up!,"I really enjoyed ""The Die is Cast"", but I did not enjoy ""The Die is Cast Part II"" only because there is no such episode. The first part of that episode is ""Improbable Cause (Episode 65)"" Also, there is an episode between ""Improbable Cause"" and ""The Die is Cast"" called ""Through The Looking Glass(Episode 66)."" I do not mean to offend anyone, but, you need to write the right things on your website if you ask me."
1,lacking in depth,"Stephanie has a nice raw voice. But, it lacks depth. She seems to be singing about someone else's expereinces, not embodying them herself. I'd encourage her to allow herself to really feel what she is singing. Otherwise, I don't imagine she'll go very far."
3,"Okay, Could have been done better","I just got finished reading a review of mine which 15 people found unhelpful, so I'm going to try to be more constructive in my comments.Here goes: Too much time was devoted to Curzon. All the other hosts (the one exception being Joran) had about a minute to make there existense and personality known. Curzon got half the hour, and Curzon was the only past host Jadzia talked about in most of the episodes, so we already knew much more about him then any other host. Otherwise, this was a pretty good episode.Now watch, I'll probably get 15 more ""unhelpful"" tally votes. (That is if 15 people even see this, I know the page for this video doesn't get much traffic)"
2,Well...Almost...,"Received advertised products in a reasonable time. The ones that worked properly are fun, but one has a bad switch and does not work at all! The other only works intermittently, which kind of takes away from the moment, if you know what I mean...I will never purchase again due to the lack of quality control!!!Buy several if you buy, to get one that works!"
1,Disappointing,I had very high hopes for these. My wife isn't very adventurous so I wanted something subtle to try and spice things up. The most we got out of these was a very weak and very annoying vibration. It didn't fit the places we wanted it too and was alot louder than expected. Not worth a penny
1,revisiting behaviorism,"Beyond Freedom & DignityPolitical philosopher B F Skinner's popularized presentation of behaviorism paints a picture of humanity that removes the soul or mind and leaves a machine. This must be what the author himself is also, along with the reader. Being machines, acting according to contingencies in the environment, we ought to move toward a more harmonious way of life where one could grow up without doing anything that used to deserve punishment.We should reject such reductionist views and such altruist ethics."
2,Beyond Freedom and Dignity,"The book is a classic,but the condition of it was annoying,and distracting. Apparently the book had been a study item,and frequently underlined."
5,Tremendous,This book is great for all readers and is a great biography that puts you in the mind of a writer. You will feel like you are actually there witnissing these masterfull events.
1,Useless piece of junk,I bought this as a filler item and I wish I had bought a kids toothbrush or something else. This knife has been used three times so far and the blade is already bent.
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,"I had to read this book for one of my literature classes this spring and I found that I could not put this book down. I was even reading it while I was vacationing! It neither is a ""nature"" book nor a ""people"" book, but some combination of both. I think it's a true book for the soul, a real refresher course packed in less than 400 pages! Can you tell I loved it?"
4,Interesting Read,"- As an author myself, I recommend that you purchase this book. ""Refuge"" gave my friend a good scare about reality. Personally I thought this book deserves to be used in the creation of a movie. It has a Pullitzer prize novel feel to it.Author. ""Knowledge For Tomorrow"" Quinton D. Crawford"
2,Disappointed,"Although I found the passages about Ms. Williams relationships with her mother and grandmother and their struggles with cancer to be well-written and moving, I am surprised that she and many other reviewers imply that the cancers were the consequences of nuclear testing. I think of myself as an environmentalist, and I believe that such testing is likely to have been harmful to human health; however, the striking family history of breast and ovarian cancer in this case strongly suggests that there is a genetic disorder (mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) that was responsible for the cancer in these women. I was living in Salt Lake City during the spring of 1983, and the flooding was indeed dramatic, but I was bored by the rather repetitious descriptions of the refuge and the birds."
4,If you have been affected by cancer it is worth reading!!!,"I loved and hated this book. It is beatifully written. I found the author frustrating at times. Some parts got a little long winded about the birds. It takes you on a emotional rollercoaster but the pay off of finishing this book is worth it. Any one who has been affected by cancer will find this book very inciteful to the process of going through treatment and also the death process. Terry Tempest gives the most authentic and honest account of what life is like living through cancer I have every read. She put into words thought and feelings I could never express fully.The research of the history of the Great Salt Lake was very fun to read about. I have lived in Utah all my life, but I have never been to the Lake I now am very curious to see it and the bird refuge. I think I will find the trip much more interesting now than if I had gone before reading this book."
5,Loved this & sent numerous to others with cancer families,"When asked for a suggestion of a Utah author, a bookstore owner gave me my first copy of Refuge. I enjoyed the prose, giving each chapter space to be digested in my mind for an evening or so. As a wildlife artist, I adored Williams' discriptions of the birds she followed through the Salt Lake's rise and fall. Her marvelous relationship with her mother and other family members particularly touched me as my own mother goes through cancer. I got a chuckle out of another review from a male from Utah who did not care for the book. As a recent transplant to Utah, I have been continuously amazed at how egotistical male members of LDS seem to be...reading his review confirmed this thought. I have given numerous copies of this book to many mothers and daughters who are going though various forms of cancer or have a love of nature. Probably best not to give it to any Mormon males, however."
3,Not great but not bad,"I thought this book was just okay. I had high hopes for this book after I read select excerpts in my literature and environment class. And on some levels, it did deliver. There were parts of the book that were very touching and beautiful. Especially the parts concerning her family and the people side of things. But there were other parts that were quite boring. I mean, they were beautiful in a sense, her description of the birds and so on, but there was a little too much of that for my taste. I think it would be an excellent book for the right reader, but it wasn't quite for me. That being said, I do like that she has a very distinctive and unique voice and I like the way that she blends narratives together and I did indeed find some of the environmental things very interesting. However, after a while it sort of felt like they were just lists of birds. Perhaps it would have helped if I had been familiar with the birds."
5,"Powerful, illuminating and so human.","I had the privilege to be in a workshop with Ms. Williams several years ago and picked up ""Refuge"" because I had been so impressed with this woman. The book had so many levels, nature, human tragedy, ecology, survival, compassion, etc, etc. I recommended ""Refuge"" to my book club and they read it as well. I thought this was one book that should be shared and read by women everywhere."
1,read Edward Abbey instead,"This book is overrated and self-indulgent. If you do read it, don't feel compelled to like it just because you've heard so many good things about it."
1,A very difficult read and hard to understand why it is popul,"Unless you are an avid bird watcher with an interest in birds and their habitats, you will find this book difficult to understand. It is even harder to piece together the ideas the author is trying to convey. The ideas are disjointed and read worse than the diary of a thirteen year old in how everything is organized. This book was a mandatory read for a class I took and I would not have read it otherwise. The reading is monotonous and a chore to continue. Although factual in its reporting it is difficult to understand what the author wants you to know. If the ending was placed at the begining it might provide enough incentive to continue readig the book."
1,Over-reaching and obvious,"Terry Williams mother is dying of cancer...and she milks this for about as far as it will go.Don't get me wrong....dying of cancer is a horrible way to go, and I'm sorry that anyone has to go through this....BUT....when you try to somehow link this with watching birds, and Mormonism with the glue of nonsensical verbose sentences you get a book that is better thrown into the fire you keep you warm on those cold winter nights.I HATED this book and her obvious attempts at being deep."
4,On the first time through I found the reading frustrating,"Moving back and forth from the ecology of the birds and lake to the progress of the relationships etc. was initially frustrating. As it progressed and with reflection, I saw the pattern and came to see a great deal of wisdom and value in this book. I'm very glad I read it."
3,"Lyrical passages, touching passages and a little confusion","I kept coming back to the book because of the author's perspective on loss and comfort. I found the bird preserve parts a little long and tedious at times, but clearly important to the author and woven into the rest of the book. I read this before seeing Terry Tempest Williams speak, and was won over by her as much as by the book."
5,Great toy!,"I purchased this for my son's sixth birthday. It is great. He loves it. There are so many great pieces (binoculars, stethascopes, tags, etc.) It is a great toy to play with. We have purchased other sets as well and have been equally happy."
5,NIKON Lens cap,I purchased this cap because I installed some filters on my Coolpix 8800 and I am very happy with my purchase.
3,fits perfect,it is set in a plastic clear bag with nikon and its info all over it. it looks fake almost as I have never bought Nikon parts packaged as such. but there were all the correct numbering and part numbers on the cap.overall it looks and fits correctly. I did feel the edges of it and it feels a bit more sharper then the one that I had with my lens. maybe i'll take a light file to it and soften the edges.
5,replacement cap,I lost my lens cap and purchased this one to replace it. It is a perfect fit. It is a good product.
3,Clear as mud.,"This book is not for beginners. 75% of the instructions are clear, its the 25% that will stop you dead in your tracks. They say things like connect this to that and snap this to the other thing. What is ""other"" thing supposed to be? I would not recommend for beginners, you will get disappointed once you get through 50% of the tutorial and be completely lost half way through."
1,The Complete Reference?! Hardly!,"I won't mince words. If you are relatively new to Maya, do not buy this book! Even if you are an experienced user, I would imagine it would be a waste of money. Very early in the book, I found myself becoming quite frustrated while attempting the tutorials as steps are missing or are just flat out wrong! I'm relatively new to Maya, but even I can recognize mistakes in the text. I'm cutting my losses and not continuing with the book as see a losing battle ahead. If there are problems with the simple, introductory tutorials, I can only imagine the headaches involved with the more advanced tutorials. Given the glaring errors in the text, I seriously wonder whether or not anyone bothered to proofread it!Save yourself some money and pass on this book. I would not buy newer versions either unless the authors take some time to do a major overhaul of the text."
3,"good reference, but errors in tutorials","I use this book in my 3D Modeling classes. It presents the concepts of Maya very well, but the tutorials have many errors making the experience of learning Maya frustrating. In my classes, I'm now able to point out the errors ahead of time, but the firt time we used this book, working through the errors was very discouraging for the students. By contast, the Alias Learning Tools books have error-free tutorials - so writing good tutorials can be done. Maya is a complex program and any book written to teach such a program should have flawless tutorials - a problem I have find with many techncal books."
5,Completely Useful,"This is a great book for learning Maya and for looking up features you haven't used before. If you're buying a book like this, you should find the most up-to-date one though ... probably for Maya 2010."
4,Cute,Adorable movie. Had seen it many years ago and thought it would be a nice addition to my Tim Curry collection.
5,Bad Witch,I saw this when I was little and then didnt see it for several years. I was surprised when I found out it was on DVD because I remembered it being a made for tv movie. That being said its a good movie. You should see it.
3,It was just okay,"Watched this with the grandchildren. They said they liked it but they would since it was a gift from me. The story line was cute but the visual effects were pretty hokey. If they thought so, they didn't say. I wouldn't buy another one of this series."
4,As expected,"This movie was one of my favorites growing up. It was fun to see it again. The quality isn't like today's movies, but it was just what I expected. I enjoyed watching it again and my 3 year old is now a fan too."
3,"Fun, clean movie for elementary school girls","This movie is cute, even though nowadays it would be an absolute flop at the box office. There are lots of good lessons about believing in yourself, even when things go wrong. The actors do a great job, and the special effects are a bit like traveling back in time. The picture quality wasn't very good--even the credits aren't a sharp image."
4,The fabulous Miss Hardbroom,"Before there was a Harry Potter, there was a poor underappreciated student witch by the name of Mildred Hubble (Fairuza Balk). Not exactly a natural at this sort of thing, it takes some time before Mildred comes into her own; with a vengeance.The story is fairly basic, the characters classics of their type, the F/X are dreadful, the music horrid, and the pacing is slug-slow. There is no attempt to build suspense; the supposed takeover of the school is handled in such an offhanded manner as to be completely forgotten at times. Tim Curry mugs shamelessly as a dreamboat wizard that is anything but. Actually, there are only a few reasons to watch this movie: Fairuza Balk, Charlotte Rae, and of course Diana Rigg (the only reason I bought this DVD). And, begrudgingly, there are enough cute bits to make it worth your while. I can't see watching it every year though, maybe every other year, for Diana if nothing else."
5,I drove my family nuts watching this all the time,That Nasty Ethel Hallow turned into a pig! Mildred messing up the broomstick formation! The meany teacher putting the moves on the Grand Wizard! This movie was the main reason I looked forward to Halloween every year. A classic. I hope its available soon!
5,One of my favorites,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It was MAGICAL. Watching it now, the CG is questionable at best...but man did I love this movie as a young 'un."
4,The Worst Witch never changes,"This is a favorite of mine since I was in elementary school, and it has not changed. Wish they would clean it up a bit, because it looks the same on DVD as it did on TV back when it first aired"
4,Timeless fun!,"My daughter loved it when she was 12; I bought this for my grandchildren. Tim Curry is his scrumptious self; adults will get as much out of this as kids will. The original ""Harry Potter""."
5,The Worst Witch,Bought this for the Grandkids. Their Mother loved it when she was little thought they might too. Boy was I right. They rolled around with laughter.It has held up over the years. I believe it was done originally as an after school special and was seen for many years on tv but have not seen it for some time. So glad to have found it so the kids can watch it for halloween with their Mom.
2,"Movie's funny, but quality is TERRIBLE","This is probably the worst DVD I've ever seen. I realize it's a made-for-TV movie, but so was Disney's Tower of Terror, and that DVD is crystal clear, with excellent sound. This one is terrible--the sound fades in and out, the picture is grainy, it's pretty much impossible to watch. I have yet to finish it, because the quality is so bad. Maybe I just got a bum DVD, but it looks like the original film quality is pretty bad, so I didn't try to exchange it."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"When I was a child I loved this movie, so of course now that I have kids I was excited to get this for my kids, well as I sat there watching it I could not believe how terrible the acting, plot and songs were. I remained silent only to see that my kids loved it.If you have school age kids that need to be kept occupied while you are preparing holiday festivities this is a good choice but if you plan to watch a movie with your kids you may want to pick another title."
3,I would rethink this purchase...,"Advice: never buy something purely for the sake of nostalgia. I did, because I remembered watching this movie so many times as a kid, fondly. Don't get me wrong, parts of this movie were campy and fun. But not enough to lay down about $15.00 for. Some of this movie is like dropping acid, it is so trippy. And the special effects are not dazzling, as they claim. I did not expect them to be, but they were the worst thing I had ever seen. Okay, if you loved it, there are some redeeming virtues. Fariuza Balk, a really cute pig and some kittens, some cool costumes... but besides that, I wouldn't ever buy this movie again."
4,Worst Witch,"Fabulous children's movie. Loved it as a child. Still love it, as an adult.Mildred Hubble is the worst witch in her school. She can't do anything right. From making the wrong potion, falling off her broom, to turning her classmate into a pig, instead of a frog. She eventually decides to run away. But while running away, she over hears some evil witches plans to take over the school. Only Mildred can stop them. And it just may turn out that Mildred will become the best witch instead of the worst."
3,The Worst Witch,Kind of cute and funny but expected a little more. I really love the actors and actresses in this film though.
5,Childhood fav,I am very happy I purchased this movie. It was a childhood favorite and now as I have children I can let them enjoy it.
4,The Worst Witch (The Movie),"If you are a ""Worst Witch"" fan, you will love this movie! The story progress follows the same light hearted, life lesson situations as in ""The Worst Witch TV Series"". It is aimed more to the young teen than an adult. However, any parent will have a lot of fun sharing this movie experience with their ""enthusiastic Worst Witch daughter fan!"
4,This is the best kids movie,"I remeber when I was a kid I watched this movie all the time. The graphics are not that great but still its a good movie for kids 6-12?? It's a bout a young witch who does nothing right and it not like the other witches, she doesnt even have a black cat her's is brown. When this DVD comes out I am sure to get it."
5,This movie rocks!!!,"It's the cheesiest movie ever, but I have loved it since it used to come on HBO around Halloween every year (mid-late 80's, I'm now 27 yrs old), so when it finally came out on DVD, I had to purchase it. The part when Tim Curry sings the ""Anything can happen on Halloween"" song...absolutely hilarious!!! Everyone needs to see this movie at least once!!"
4,finally out to dvd,"the worst witch dvd is a great addition to any collection. the movie stars fairuza balk in her second film, as well as many other favorites such as diana rigg and tim curry. this movie has been long out of print and now with it's dvd release many harry potter fans will enjoy this film. the only downfall to this dvd would have to be no special features which is why it loses a star. altogether a great movie and a joy to have on dvd. loved it as a child and will enjoy it with dvd quality picture now that my vhs is quite run down."
4,The Best of the Worst,As a child i loved movies about wizardry and fancied going to a witchy school. This movie is a light and spooky film the whole family will enjoy (8 up)Enjoy!
4,Good movie,I remembered watching this movie when I was younger. It is definitely a movie that most people haven't heard of. For some strange reason I like this movie even though it is cheesy and the special effects are horrible.
5,The Worst Witch,I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes to watch movies as a family without having to worry about kids seeing something inappropriate.
4,Great movie,"This was one of my favourite movies as a kid, and it's still great fun to watch as an adult!"
5,"Worst Witch- movie for kids, parents will love it!!","Had not seen this movie on cable or TV for many years.My kids grew up in 80s..this was an annual favorite.Recording equip of the time was not high quality andhad commercials. Now they can watch a clean (not subject matter, rather quality of view) whenever they want"
1,Horrible,This movie is one of the worst ones I have ever watched. The only reason I watched it the whole way through was because my mom bought it for me at my request and I would have felt guilty if I hadn't. This movie had the worst effects I have ever seen - even a 1920's movie would be better than this! The plot - horrible/stupid/idiotic! The acting itself was much to be desired. To sum up - don't waste your money - buy a real movie instead!
1,UGH!,"The title of this movie should be ""The Worst Dance Scene."" I used to watch this movie when I was a little kid and even back then I would grow incredibly EMBARASSED when Tim Curry began his ridiculous song and dance. Don't get me wrong, I think Tim Curry is great. I loved him in ""Clue"" and ""Legend"" but this is beyond embarrassment! So to wrap this up if you want to watch a movie that will make a 3 year old feel silly to be watching it order this peice of tripe! WHY, TIM, WHY?"
1,"We squirmed through the first half, then turned it off",First time I have ever actually thrown a video in the trash!
1,"Jaymes Seals Matt Ackerman and Steven ""Creeper"" Simon",Wow if their was a way to give this movie 0 stars we would. This entire film is the most ridiculous excuse for a witch or halloween movie We've ever seen. It fails long before Tim Curry's depressingly bad solo Oh well Tim Curry sucks anyway! The music is truly horrible it's all like drums and crappy editing and bright gay colors and the picture quality is like looking in a butthole...The witch chases after a piece of dog dookie ah ha ha named Mildred Hubbble(Fairuza Balk) All in all this movies acting stinks the colors stink this movie stinks etc... I could go on all day but I can't find my tambourine!
3,The Worst Witch,"This is one of the movies I grew up watching every year on Halloween. It is not full of Sci-Fi Graphics, but this is a family friendly movie that encourages everyone to never give up. Mildred is one of those kids who can never seem to do anything right, but when she looks past failure and tries her best, magical things happen."
2,This was not the good movie I thought it was,"I love Tim Curry movies except this one. I enjoyed Facts Of Life, so I though Charlotte Rae was a good choice to add her. Fairuza balk was good in Return To Oz and Waterboy. But this show didn't quite do it for me. The packaging was good. Good condition DVD. This does not reflect on the sellers at all."
5,Just to see her smile,"I bought The worst Witch move for baby girls 25th, birthday. when she opened this gift, The look on her face was well worth the search on Amazon.con. They also found another movie she wanted ""Savanah smiles"" she had been asking for these old movies for years. THANK YOU ""AMAZON.COM Donna Rodriguez"
4,I just keep coming back,"First off this is my first review and I don't know why all of a sudden I just had to review this movie. This was one of my favorite movies when I was younger and now at 18 I have to say that I still love to watch it. I can't figure out what it is that makes me love it so much. The effects are bad and the movie is predictable, but I just keep coming back for more.Do yourself a favor and buy the movie and see how incurably bad (in a weird good way) it is."
5,Love IT!,"Guilty pleasure from my preteen HBO days...Teh songs are fun and Tim Curry is always a treat...the effects are sub sub par, but you gotta love it!"
4,Watching the Worst Witch,"I watched this movie when i was little. My oldest brother was into magic and he introduced me to this movie. Yes, it is an older movie with cheap effects, but at that time I didn't realize it. I thought the movie was cool. Now I actually see the difference. I do like the movie still, though. I know what it is like to be outcast and hardly ever have a good day where things actually go right for a change. I recommend this movie for younger children who definetly like magic. :)"
3,Halloween Tradition!,"When I was about 7, my 2nd grade teacher showed this movie in class one day close to Halloween. I told my mom how much I loved it and she recorded it off HBO for me. Ever since then, it's become a tradition to watch it every Halloween, and now my own children partake in this tradition with me!Yes, it's very cheesy, the special effects are VERY 80's, but c'mon, what else would you expect?"
2,"Could have been useful, BUT ...","Pros: Light-weight, high-quality and magnifies 2X.However, if you have bad eyesight, 2X won't be enuf. It would've been more useful had it been 3X and longer.Another reason for me to get a KINDLE ... I could at least, change the FONT SIZE and that would solve my problem.:>("
3,Buyer Beware,"This computer will not work with the HP LaserJet 1020 printer.Seriously.There is a service bulletin out which simple concedes that these two pieces of HP equipment won't work with one another.Again, it is a sign of how far down HP has slid in terms of engineering and production: two HP products currently being sold as new that won't work together."
3,Odo and Quark stranded!,"Odo is escorting Quark to a Federation trial when they find a bomb on their Runabout, the resulting explosion forces the ship to crash on to a planet with sub-zero temperatures. Odo and Quark must work together to take the sub-space transmitter high enough up a mountain for it to send out an emergency message.This is an average episode with some excellent dialogue between Quark and Odo, the sub-plot about Jake and Nog is less entertaining and bogs down this otherwise great episode."
2,It's just OK,"Hey, this book is not bad. You get a list of the 100 best ski resorts of the world...mmm...isn't that the title of the book? Good title. The information is very concise. But something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong with a book like this. Ah, yes...the information is easily outdated...nothing you can't get from a web site which has more updated information. I can't think of a good reason to buy this book because it is in black and white so you can't exactly enjoy the photography which there is a terribly ""lack of"" in the book. You might want to save your money on this one. I did buy it, for your information, but I bought it used for pennies...and I still feel ripped off. Arrgg..."
5,Classic World Series,"This was a classic World Series, and the last ""traditional"" Series, before the LCS was added. Bob Gibson dominated Detroit in the series, striking out 17 in Game 1, but was bested by Mickey Lolich, who won all three of his starts, including Game 7.One of the top World Series of all time."
5,Art with Tim Holtz,"I think that this a wonderful dvd for learning how to do this art work, and a wonderful resource to go back to."
5,The Journey Continues with Tim Holtz,I love Tim Holtz. He always has great new techniques.There are several I plan on trying right a way.
5,Waiting for the DVD,"I've seen this as a gift box set including the original episde, the DS9 episode, and a tribble. Great idea, I thought, but where's the DVD version? C'mon Paramount - I'm waiting to buy."
5,I wore out the tape,"I taped this program when it was first on and I've since worn out the tape watching it. They should release this on DVD with a ""making of"" reel and the TOS episode!I'll have to enjoy the VHS 'till they do."
5,The Unavailable Episode,"One of the more clever episodes in the Star Trek universe; WHY is Paramount witholding the video tape? Is there some exploitive agenda involved to make the fans grovel and pay through the nose? Is there some vendetta with the writers, the actors, the fans? Is there anyone from Paramount that can confirm or deny this officially?live long and prosper, rayna"
4,Strong on history and photos; not a buyer's guide,"It says it right on the cover: ""Osprey Expert Histories."" And that's what this is. There's great info on the history of these cars, with insights on how they evolved technically and stylistically, and how their marketing changed over the years. The typeface is a little on the large side, but that just means there are more pages to print photos on: Virtually every page has at least one. I would say this book is a good value.Note that this is not a buyer's guide; there are no side-by-side charts of features and horsepower and units sold, and no commentary on what to look out for.Also note that its coverage is limited to the pagoda (1960s) and W107 cars (70s-80s). There are a couple of pages on the early 300SL, and none on the new (post-W107) styles of SL/SLK."
3,"A decent book, but not written for U.S. model owners","The book is well written, and covers the subject matter well enough. However, the book focuses almost exclusively on UK and European model cars. Only a few pages and two pictures are on U.S. domestic models. (Both pictures commented on how certain aspects of the American versions made them unattractive!) Since the technical specifications, performance, options, and even trim packages on the U.S. Federal models are generally different from the U.K. and European models, the book is not all that useful for us Yankees. Most of the book is black and white, with a few color pages.The book is a good value though. So if you own a Non-Fedral model (""grey market"" in the U.S.), or are running out of books to buy on SL's, it is worth buying."
5,Perfect!,"Sure, I'll want to watch a stupid reality show every now and then...and, sure, I can stomach some of the violence and such that we see on tv... But at long last, here's a tv show that I can watch that puts a genuine smile on my face and that I would never be embarassed to watch with my family. Good clean fun and humor with great acting and characters. And you can watch the shows over and over again without tiring of them. Enjoy it!"
5,So Long waiting for this DVD,"I waited a while to get this DVD, mainly for financial reasons, anyway, I knew I wanted it because I Love the show. And when it is on USA cable, it is just about the only show I watch.The great appeal of this set is that it has episodes I have not seen on tv, and thankfully so, since the widescreen format is great.The quality and care of the presentation in this set is very much appreciated. Well worth it to get the little extra collectors bit too :-).And I am definitely looking forward to the season 2 disc set.If you love monk on tv, then this set is totally the thing to get."
5,Solving crime the fun way.,"Monk doesn't have the gloomy feel that dominates most murder thrillers. What we've is an funny man with some real problem-solving talents, making criminals pay for what they've done. The episodes are witty, and the plots brilliant. But if these are still not enough, watching Monk win a game of Clue without a throw of the dice should make your money worth. I can't wait for this DVD."
5,monk seasons 2 and 3,"I purchased these particular seasons and season one which I've yet to receive,but I believe with the fine natural acting Bitty Schram did as Sharona Fleming and a perfect New Jersy accent along with her obvious care for the character MONK set the tone for the entire show. She created a character that will never be forgotten! She also has a great ambidextrous backhand playing tennis WOW! All this and great beauty, too.Tony Shaloub is a fine and versatile actor. It's a shame he did not trust that to be discovered with the presence of Bitty. A great show was given way to going in a ""different direction"".Did her Golden Globe award nomination concern Mr. Shaloub?An actor with his fine ability lost out on the chance to be considered one of the most memorable TEAMS in show business!After Bitty left I no longer watched the show!!!"
2,Monk Season One,"They arrived on time when promised. The programs were great. Able to here and see everything well. But the bonus features with the producers, actors and others that are the meat of this wonderful program are inaudible. The music is there (very softly) but no spoken words can be heard. I was very disappointed."
5,Monk: Season One,"I highly recommend the Monk series. I had never watched it before until about 3 months ago when I had gone to a laundry mat late at night and this laundry mat had a television showing an episode of Monk. Monk was extremely captivating and though my laundry was done, I had to finish the 2nd episode of Monk that was played back to back.The DVD was in good condition. I had gradually purchase other seasons as they became available through other sellers."
5,Yay for MONK!,"I will admit it, right at the beginning, that it would be very difficult to disappoint me with anything MONK-related. Nevertheless, this DVD set of the first season is so entertaining and interesting that I was glued to the set for hours. As a collector of all-things MONK, I was ecstatic to receive 2 shows (Marathon Man and Red-Headed Stranger) that I had never seen before. The additional featurettes were excellent and I even learned some new things about MONK and OCD I never knew before. All the MONK characters are so excellent and the shows so well-written that they can be watched again and again. Yay Tony Shalhoub (he is great in EVERYTHING he does) and YAY MONK"
5,Mr. Monk you rock!!!!,We want the monk. We want the monk. We got the monk.Monk is a wonderful and well written show. This is a must get DVD for all Monk fans. I been a Monk fan since season one and will still watch Adrian Monk on Fridays.I'm going to get this DVD!!!Adrian and Sharona are a perfect couple.
5,refreshingly original,"""Monk"" is the first American detective/crime series in years that I have enjoyed - comedic or otherwise. Shows like ""CSI"" and other slick, new crime productions fall flat compared to their British counterparts, with too much shoot-em-up violence, lame dialogue and all the lead actors looking like they stepped out of a Calvin Klein ad.The fact that ""Monk"" is comedy-based doesn't at all retract from it's being a valid detective show. It works on all levels. Both Tony Salhoub and Bitty Schram do fabulous jobs. A real must-see."
5,Top 5 Shows of All Time,"I hadn't watched many Monk reruns, so I hadn't seen this in a long time. It's a great show. This season definitley reminded me why I miss Sharona. This DVD has good special features, too. If you don't like this show then I don't know why. This is a great crime/drama/comedy show. I can't wait to get season 2 and 3."
3,Monk is Always Right,"I began watching Monk occasionally while living in Germany. Two friends of mine were crazy about the show. If only they could see it in the original English. It's twice as good. I never had the chance to see the series premiere until now. I expected more background on how Monk developed his neurotic behavior and what he was like before his wife's death. I was also disappointed to see how his relationship with the captain was strained at first once he became a ""private consultant"". It's good to know things improve. How did he wind up with his ""nurse"" Sharona? I admit I haven't seen that many episodes from early on in the series, so I hope some of the questions will be answered during the first few seasons."
4,"Monk, the man who fears no things, or does he?","Monk is one of the best mystery/comedy shows ever (since we don't have cable or satilite we rent the DVD's and sure enough it was a hip in comedies and mysteries!) Tony plays former police officer Adrian Monk who solved all sorts of difficult puzzles. For example how can a 800 pound man known as Dale the Whale could get in a house and kill a lady. Or how did Adrian's wife died and who was the killer. What ever mystery happans Monk always solves it in the end! And Monk has this phobia and so he likes everything nice and clean (he wouldn't fight DarthVader because he doesn't like the sight of blood.) And he also has an assistent who of course doesn't like Adrian too much... I recomend if you a Nancy Drew fan, you won't be afraid to watch MONK!"
3,NO CLOSED CAPTIONING?,"I was eager to share Mr Monk with a deaf friend, but that was not possible as, for some odd reason, the DVD version doesn't have closed captioning. How stupid is that? Even the DVD of the Mary Tyler Moore Show's first season is closed captioned. I feel as though I've wasted my money."
3,"Fantastic Show, no audio on Extras","I love this show and watch every show of every ""season"" (if you can call 6 shows a season).But when I rented this and watched the Extras explaining Monk's Origins, colleagues, etc.,NO AUDIO!WHAT GOOD IS THAT?P.S. Bring Sharona back!!"
4,"uneven series, but very important","Despite (especially in later seasons) laughably bad writing, this series is the only one to explore what it is like for widowers. Monk's reaction to Trudy makes no sense, except to those who have been there. His OCD complicates things. He survives because of others and his love of detective work. A very important show. I recommend it only for the insight it gives. Everything else including the so-called detective stories is laughably bad."
4,"Excellent music, fair collection.","Just to be clear, this is the best of ""Velvet Underground"" AND ""Lou Reed"", so you're getting some of both eras. Since it doesn't focus on one or the other, it's missing some from both. It's a long list, but mostly I miss ""Heroin"" and ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", and ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Temporary Thing"". Truthfully I would go for an all ""VU"" collection, then a ""Lou Reed"" one afterwards. Still though, this is all good stuff, but should be called ""Some Of The Best""."
4,It's pretty loud.,Mine is pretty loud. It's a good bit louder and easier to blow than a howler but slightly less loud than a Fox-40. I'm a little disappointed but I'll still use it. I'm really glad they came out with an orange version. That's what I was waiting for before buying one.Note: I take these reviews very seriously. If you have a criticism of the review please leave a comment. Just because you disagree doesn't count.
5,Great innexpensive whistle for survival and camping.,"Works great and is pretty loud, and it's plastic so if it's cold out it won't stick to your lips. It also doesn't rattle and comes with a short cord to go around you neck. Very light, too."
2,This whistle blows,For this kind of money you would expect a terrific product. The whistle is built solid and comes with a handy strap but other than that this whistle blows. The bottom line is this whistle IS NOT very loud! It takes a lot of lung power and even at that the whistle IS NOT very loud! It sounds like a kiddy train whistle. You'd be better off buying a $1.00 conventional referees whistle!
2,Some reviews were not accurate about this whistle,One review said this whistle had good loudness with very little wind (breath blow).I purchased it for my invalid wife so she could get my attention for help. She could not make it loud enough to be particle
2,not very loud,i purchased this whistle after a woman in my neighborhood was raped. the whistle was very colorful but not very loud
5,great! I love it,"light and great design, I bought 2 jet scream for both me and my little, it sounds really high , good product"
2,Not a distinguishable enough sound,"Bought it for my husband to get my attention when he needs help from the second floor, but unless I'm in the vacinity of the stairwell I don't hear it and I have excellent hearing. It isn't working very well for the purpose purchased."
3,Not as expected,"This requires strong lung power. When I say strong I mean a great deal of air pressure must be produced and I can feel the blood pressure in my neck and face rise when I blow on it forcefully. It seems less loud than the fox sharx. It produces a pitch that I find dis-favorable and it only achieves a blasting volume. It cannot be used for light blows for situations where only a normal volume of whistling is required.Goodluck,Matthew"
4,"Loud, high-pitched, good safety device, not really a toy","Pros:-Loud, high pitched, shrieking sound.-Lightweight.-Was easily able to feed the small lanyard into my keychain (I bought the Jet Scream as a safety device for when I go jogging on a fairly secluded path).Cons:-The price has definitely fluctuated on this item; I think it depends on how many are in stock. I paid $10.44 which is a bit overpriced. It's at $7 now, which seems about right.Notes:-I think this whistle is categorized as a toy on Amazon. It really isn't. The sound is extremely high pitched and fairly painful on the ears. If you're buying a whistle as a toy, I'd recommend a traditional police whistle style."
1,Don't worry about your ears.,This is a nicely made whistle that barely makes any noise. Perhaps I got a defective whistle but it is difficult to get much noise out of it. Not useful as a small boat whistle for which it was purchased and not remotely entertaining enough to be considered a toy that a child might like. It might work as an almost silent whistle for nearby dogs? I do not recommend it at any price.
3,Good but not great.,I was a little disappointed that this whistle wasn't louder for the price. However it is solidly constructed and this version (the orange one) is highly visible. I attached it to my neck knife and I'll say so far the lanyard on the whistle is very sturdy I've pulled on it and hung it on things and it hasn't broken. Overall it's a good whistle but I expected it to be louder for the price and brand name.
2,Bashir better be quickening... I'm... QUICK!,"Bashir and Dax find a planet whose inhabitents have annoyed the Founders and suffered the consequences, the whole race is infected with a disease called 'the Blight'. Bashir is desperate to find a cure to this hideous disease, but his electronic equipment makes 'the Blight' worse. With no equipment can the Doctor save a whole race?A strange episode that concentrates on Bashir's relationship with a patient, Ekoria, who is heavily pregnant and trusts Bashir."
5,AJ,This book helped explain how I make my life more healthy and the reasons why I should make certain changes in my diet.
5,Really Opens your Eyes,"This book explains in very easy to understand detail why the current medical system is not patient friendly. It does not know how to treat chronic illness very well if at all. Many doctors have tunnel vision and treat so many of their patients like one size fits all. I have multiple health issues that are definitely improved by a good diet and the right supplements. The nutritonal info is terrific. I knew much of the information already, but it is great to see it reinforced by these authors. A must read for anyone wanting to improve their health and wellness. The whole foods concept is what I grew up on and it is something we all need to get back to. I am on a journey to better health, and this book will definitely give me some good info to use."
4,E-book version & Hardcover,"It is easy to read and full of real-life applications. Much of the information and science is available elsewhere, but this book is an easy way to begin planning a healthy lifestyle. The hardcover and softcover versions have been given as gifts, if that confirms my endorsement! The ebook version travels with me on my PDA. Amazon had problems with the download, initially, and it took a week of whining from me, but eventually it worked. All-in-all, Ultraprevention has sage advice and is a fast read!"
2,A disappointing reproduction,"Actually, I was disappointed with the paperback edition. The hard cover edition was printed on good paperstock and a pleasure to read. The paperback version seemed much smaller, was printed on inferior paper and was a ""tired"" copy. It was not of the quality which would make me want to give it as a gift to a friend."
4,A lighter Stoner,"This is one of the lighter toned books in the Harry Stoner detective series as Harry leaves his native Ciccinnati and goes to Los Angeles to investigate the murder of a soap opera writer. The Hollywood types Stoner matches wits with here just are not as menacing as the street toughs he usually tackles in Cincinnati. Nevertheless, as with all Stoner books, you get a first rate detective story in the bargain."
5,GD Rules,Just saw these guys in Denver this is a hard to get ahold of cd and is good in your GD collection if you're a big fan of the band.....a brief look into what GD sounded like before their 1st domestic release....won't dissapoint fans of the band.....and shouldn't dissapoint fans of metal in particular....
2,All that is unholy....,"This cd was kinda a waste of time. All I really needed by God Dethroned was the Grand Grimoire. Even the new album, Ravenous, is still questionable. If you do not have the Grand Grimoire get that album before you get anything else from God Dethroned."
2,Doesn't keep baby's head from falling forward,"It's nice and soft, but my 16 month old daughter's head still looks like it's going to fall off when she's in a deep sleep. It stops her head from going sideways but does nothing to stop it from falling forward. I'm not sure if she's too young to use this or not."
4,Great book for people who like Changing Rooms,"If you are addicted to Changing Rooms, like myself, You will like this. It's got lots of unique ways to arrange everyday objects into the style you want."
4,Great design ideas,Laurence does it yet again. Great ideas projects and designs.. I just love the book and the show...
2,Potential Never Fully Realized.,"""The Sword of Kahless"" had everything going for it: Potential upheavel in Klingon politics, the return of Kor (from the Original Series and an earlier episode of DS9), the return of Toral (a son of one of Worf's biggest enemies, Duras) and, of course, Klingons!When Worf, Jadzia Dax and Kor find the location of the Sword of Kahless (the Klingons' version of Excalibur), they must race to find the sword before renegade Klingon Toral can. Whomever holds the Sword of Kahless will be able to wield considerable influence in Klingon politics, you see (it's as if Kahless, the ""father"" of all Klingons, has chosen his heir), and Worf and Kor want to make sure that that isn't Toral. Good premise but the story is poorly executed and, in the end, the status quo remains unchanged. Klinogn political upheavel would have been fun!This episode could've been a lot better."
2,There must be a better internet joke book,"I have read this book, and it is funny but there could be more done in this category. I hope that I eventually find a good internet joke book."
2,Is This Atari 2600???,"This game would have had poor graphics for Sega Genesis, so it looked terrible for XBox.Game play was confusing and frustrating. My computer ""partner"" Mech was near worthless, and at times it was hard to tell what was going on. The background tended to blend with or merge with objects which made it difficult to pick tagets or define locations.I only gave it 2 starts because when you actually got into wide open spaces and could see, shooting other mechs was OK.Not recommended."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Do not waste your time or money on this product. I was extremely disappointed with it. It looks cheap and feels cheap. The clasp for holding medical information would not stay closed. I do not believe this bracelet would have lasted a lifetime, which a medical alert bracelet needs to do. It's just not worth the money."
3,Simply Christmas is simply average.,"While Simply Christmas has great photographs and an easy-to-use format, I found that the book's crafts and decorating ideas aren't very original. Most can be found in any other Christmas crafts/decorating book. Also, I think several of the ideas are tacky. Maybe the book just isn't my style. My advice is that you check it out at your local library before buying it."
3,Not bad,"It's a cute bath, however, I'm a new home owner, never really had a yard before, so maybe it was my fault that I didn't realize this bird bath doesn't come with a stand- I had to go purchase one separately. It wasn't a big deal, but in the picture, it shows the bath on a stand. FYI for anyone interested! Other than that, it's beautiful."
3,Impressive Drawings. Lackluster Package,"The design team on this book did a wonderful job on packaging the project. Indeed Mr. Sorel is a very talented artist. The book, however, does not reach the level of being a good gift book due to it's lack of content and it is not a good coffee table book either due to the relative obscurity of some people of subject. The collaborative project is notable, and fans of the author and illustrator will surely appreciate it, but it is not a recommended purchase for anyone else."
4,The Emissary comes into his own,"After viewing an ancient picture of the Bajoran city of B'hala, Sisko retires to the holodeck to try to determine the location of the lost city. At first, he is only marginally successful in his quest...but when an accident occurs with the holodeck controls, suddenly, the Captain becomes capable of ""seeing"" the city's location. When the city is subsequently uncovered, Sisko's role as Emissary to the Bajoran people is solidified. But will it come at the cost of his standing with Starfleet? And more to the point, will his visions come at the expense of his very life?I thought this was a fabulous episode with some excellent acting on the part of Avery Brooks. Additionally, this episode provides a real turning point in that it is the episode where the character of Sisko finally comes to full acceptance of his role as Emissary. I give it 4 stars and call it a ""must see"" for Sisko fans!"
2,Rapture in time!,"Sisko is having strange dreams that lead him to uncover the lost Bajoran city, B'hala, this dreams continue and the Captain is certain that if Bajor joins the Federation then they will be doomed. With Starfleet offering Bajor acceptance into the Federation Sisko must do the exact opposite of what he was sent to Deep Space Nine to do, make sure Bajor DOESN'T join the Federation!A poor episode that is too slow and purely a Sisko-driven story."
5,perfecto,tapa original para el lente 18-55 mm de nikon. lo unico que falta es que tenga una cuerda que permita siempre estar conectada a la camara y asi evitar que se pierda.
4,For Someone Else,My brother didn't have one for his first DSLR so I bought this one for him. Taking care of your lens is important
5,Nikon snap-on lens cap,The center-pinch design is very easy to use and less prone to being knocked loose .
5,Perfect,"Just what I needed, ordered, shipped in a timely fashion. My Kudos to them. I would do business with them again."
4,functional,"It did what I needed it to. I lost my last lens cap, so needed to replace it. This was the right size for my camera."
5,Nice tight secure fitting,"I have never had a problem with mine falling off. I bought a replacement simply because my son put it somewhere in the house and it is a mystery where.I've knocked my camera, bumped it and the cap never falls off. This new one in fact clicks on tighter than the original that came with the camera. Either way, neither falls off. easy to put on and take off quickly too. 10 bucks shipped, not bad."
5,Nikon Lens Cap LC-52,"Lost mine too, right in the house (duh). No joy getting direct from Nikon. Was about to order thru a local Nikon retailer and did a search on Amazon. Not only found it, but less than half list price. What a bargain!"
3,Perfect But Pricey,"The lens cap is identical to to original one which I lost, and it works perfectly. However, I think twelve bucks for a small piece of plasic is a rip. I would have given it five stars otherwise."
1,not what i needed,i was looking for a cap to my cameras body for a nikon d300 and the title for this cap clearly says nikon d300 its to small does not fit it was a waist of money just not happy with this product at all
3,its fake,"just a warning - if you purchase from cowboy studios, its fake. it clearly is not a nikon product and only states that its ""for nikon"". quality isnt the same as OEM."
3,good,dont knw wht to say. lost my lens cap and got this one.serves the purpose.big deal. could have been more cheap i believe thats y 3stars
1,annoying cover,"Why Nikon created this frustrating cover confuses me. It has fallen off my camera lens numerous times while on garden tours and such and I had to back track myself and search. Finally I lost it at a zoo. After reading from various blogs that this is a universal problem and learned that a replacement is a little pricey when you know that it doesn't do the job. So what I did was create a soft leather cover for my lens with a strap that attachs it to camera strap with velco. It works great! I just pull it off, let it hang, and shoot. Then I slide it over the lens body when I am not shooting. It protects my entire lens and is very reliable. If you are interesting in purchasing a custom made lens cover for your lens contact me at: patriciagaydos@gmail.com. I will need to know the len size. The cost is $8.00 plus $2.00 for shipping and handling. Never lose your cover again!"
5,i love it,I was surprise when i receive this item. its pretty cool and its the same as the original. you can't tell the difference. thanks for the business..
5,Lost and Found,"I love my Nikon and Nikkor equipment.....I fret over losing pieces. Sadly my original cap disappeared in the field....literally a hay field. Anc ..ooh should I...looking for a lens cap in a field was about like looking for a needle in a haystack. :-) I prefer brand, Nikon is good to excellent quality stuff (though some of the Chinese made isn't as nice). So I was quite relieved to find this for a tolerable price and received it a few days later. I do wish Nikon would put a little loop on there for a tie, dropped it in the snow today when the click didn't catch. But it usually does the job."
5,It's a Lens Cap,It has been a life long goal of mine to write a review of a Nikon lens cap purchased from Amazon.Today I'm fulfilling this goal. I'm quite pleased it is a positive review.I would suggest you purchase at least 2 or more when you buy them. The shipping is the same and you know you will eventually loose this one too.
4,"Great lens cap, great price","Low price, high quality, is perfect combination for a quality product. I highly recommend this Nikon lens cap. Snap on design is easy to use."
4,good replacement,bought this from fivestarexperience and it was a reproduction...but if you wanna save a few bucks this is good enough for the price..doesn't hold tight on the lens like the nikon made one but hey I snap this on only when my cam goes in the bag so its not like cam is being moved around in the bag for the cap to come off..
4,It's just a lens cap,Works well. Would be nice if it connected to the camera so it doesn't get lost when it drops.
4,It Fits,"It fit, I lost the lens cap and tried another online vendor to try and find the correct one. Failed. I then tried Amazon and perfect fit. Great price as well."
4,Very good product,I had lost my original Nikon Lens cap and was looking for a godo replacement. This is a very good product and fits exactly like the original one.
4,Works as it should,"Simple order, lost mine bought this one and its works fine. My suggestion is if you buy this cap you should also find a lens cap leash as well."
1,puma copy,"the knife we received is NOT a puma, but a made in China look-a-like and not of the same quality... We ordered the REAL Puma knife from another source and is much higher quality!! This knife is in a drawer and of no use."
2,Help Miles! Im Possessed!,"I thought we got past ""Possesion"" episodes by the time this one came around. This is a majorly overdone area. And, Im sorry to say Keikos acting isn't very convincing. I dont get any real sense of evil from this being. Anyway, Miles has to do her bidding, untill (of course) he figures out her motive, and let's say the ending is terribly predictable. This episode is sub average. If I were a newcomer to DS9 and saw this episode, I wouldn't have any desire to see the next."
3,"Shades of ""Power Play""","Well, what's good for one member of the O'Brien family is good for another.In the earlier ST: NG episode, Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) becomes the pawn of a malevolent alien that possesses him. This time around his wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao) is taken over by one of the evil Pah'wraiths (that will fit so prominently in DS9's final season).While not a notable episode, it still allows a supporting character a chance to steal the spotlight and Chao does a superb job at doing just that."
5,"Adorable set, and gender neutral","This is a very cute crib bedding set, and it works for either gender. Before I had kids, my dogs were my only babies - so this was a very appealing design because it translated my love for dogs into my baby's bedroom."
5,Nikon D1X,"I have own the D1X for 6months now. The one issue some have is the older tech. batteries. Personally I didn't bother with the Nikon batteries but have bought the batteries from BatteryBarn. Great price, service and warranties.Image quality is fantastic with the colors and rendering as close to film like (Velvia) as anything I've seen.I use Nikkor 17-35f/2.8, 28-70f/2.8, 70-200f/2.8, 85f/1.4, 50f1.4 and they all do fine.I regularly make A3 (13X19) prints which are beautiful and wouldn't hesitate going much larger.One thing. Viewing an image on the LCD will make you feel like the shot is garbage but trust your abilities and the D1x as when opened up they are simply stunning.Focus is fast and accurate with any lens, AF-S or screw. The meter is very accurate.These may be of an older generation but those of us that use them love them."
1,Candy Crate Keeps Sending Wrong Product,I've ordered the Dubble Bubble Gum Party Box twice and both times they sent me Bazooka Gum which I don't like. Do you think they'd do any thing about it after numerous calls - NOT! Amazon needs to stop carrying them with their poor customer service and can't seem to send the customer what they ordered.
3,Easy to Lose,"I have lost 3 now, my first at school in the 2nd week, my second was stolen from me and I got up today to find my newest one freshly ruined by a washing machine. If you lose things easily, as I do, don't get it. Other than that, it is a good dictionary."
2,Doesn't do what it advertises,"I got this because it said it cooled room temperature wine in five minutes. It does NOT do this! Our wine was still warm in five minutes. It was just barely LIGHTLY chilled in ten minutes, but not cold enough for my taste. I didn't want something that kept a previously chilled bottle cold...I wanted it to chill the white wine I forgot to put in the fridge. I'm sure it works great for taking ALREADY cold wine to a picnic, etc. but that is not what it advertises. Therefore I will only give it 2 stars. I'm disappointed."
4,Does the job,"You can't beat it for the price. Just put wine in cooler pouch, which should be in freezer for at least couple of hours before, and in about 5-8 minutes your wine is chilled. The vinyard picture on the outside is kinda cool. It componsates for the cheapness."
3,Small hands beware!,"Like another reviewer, I expected something different. Like similar products made for keeping things cool (soda or beer in cans, etc.), this one works. However, after you slide the wine bottle into it, it takes a rather large hand to comfortably and firmly grip the bottle. If that doesn't sound like you, this cooler is not for you."
3,Wine Cooler,This was not the product that I expected. I thought it was a hard plastic cooler. It has to be frozen and was not what I expected. I do not know how it worked since it was a gift and was not used at this writing.
4,Classic Hack-N-Slash,"I totally forgot I had this game unitl I just came upon it browsing through PS2 games. Not that this game is bad, just the opposite really, but because I had bought this game when it first came out, beat it, and haven't played it since(only because my collection has grown alot).There really isn't much to say about this game. The graphics are really good, voice work(from what I can remember) is good. There really isn't anything hard about this game at all. This is just your typical hack and slash with a little bit of magic thrown in. Now, don't go thinking this is like God of War or any thing like that that because as fun as this game is, it doesn't compare to GOW.This game is great to sit and play and try to relieve stress(or maybe not). But still, my favorite slasher game is still Devil Kings, but hey, this one will do just as good."
1,Spartan: Total Warrior,"Spartan: Total WarriorI live in Norway, and unfortunately this game does not work on a norwegian PS2 - I did not know there could be any problem buying PS2 games from the US."
3,Cunningly disguised fun,"I *rented* this game and thought it was going to be simple hack and slash. I found it to be slightly more complicated hack and slash. It's not bad for what it is. Yes, you've played games like this before, but that doesn't make it bad. I found it entertaining from start to finish. If you've got a better game around save your cash. If you're bored or have some spare time, it's worth it."
4,Spartan Total Warrior Rocks!,Spartan Total Warrior Rocks. Its a great game. Lots of pepole say its worst than Rome Total War but I think its just as good. Maybye even better. It has alot of Greek mythology in it. It also has some Greek history in it but not much. The graphics are pretty good and so are the controls. The music is okay. But its a pretty good game especially if you like hack-and-slash games. I also wish they had more combos besides XXX. But overall a pretty good game. If I could give this game a 4.5 or 4.75 I would.
2,Pretty Lame,"This game isn't very good.Trying to adjust the camera angle to you're liking,can be very annoying.It's tough to pick which one is JUST right,because sometimes it will be too close or sometimes it will be too far up,as you control it with the right along stick.The gameplay is fair,but it can get pretty damn hard when you got a whole gang of enemies trying to kill you.It's tough to kill them all.Especially when your health is low,and it can get very low really fast,from the attacks.I found the graphics to be pretty bad.I know this game was made in 2005,but I can think of games that were made before then,that had better graphics than this.The music is okay,as it fits the whole theme of the game.If you plan to buy this game,don't pay too much for it.Anything over five bucks is too much for this game.I picked it up at my local video store for only two dollars,so for me it really wasn't much of a loss."
5,Great Book,"I recently recived my Ride Smart book in the mail. Its my first proper training + horsemanship book....And i absolutely LOVED IT!!! The book it-self was great condition and WOW the photography in it are great! very big and good quality! I loved this book it has everything in it from how horses lived in the wild, behaviour, instincs, breeding, how to read horses, bare back riding, tack, selecting the right horse, ground work, leading, longe line, first ride to advanced movements such as rollbacks and spins and float loading and HEAPS more!! Each chapter has ""A Better Way"" and true stories.This book is one in a million! i would defintaly reconmend it to any person who is wanting to improve their relationship with there horse!"
4,"Great Book, Wish it Had Trouble Shooting","Great book that explains the directions well. Good for basic ground work and beginners. Only down side is it doesn't really trouble shoot, it presumes your horses will figure out what you are asking without any trouble."
5,If Enya sang Scripture...,"I'm sure that trained musicologists will be able to pick apart this comparison, but as a casual listener to various genres of music, this delightful album of ""Celtic Psalms"" really just sounds like a fabulous album by Enya, if Enya sang the words of Scripture. The vocals are soaring, inspiring, and sometimes even haunting. The instrumental accompaniment is lovely, elaborate, and rather ethereal. And the lyrics are straight from the book of Psalms. As the tagline states, this album is simply gorgeous music to soothe the soul, and my wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it for many years. If you're curious about the words of the Psalms set to the Celtic music sounds of Enya, feel free to check out this wonderful collection..."
5,Best Lens Ever,"I have read where people claim that this is the sharpest and best lens you will ever own. I just got mine a few hours ago, but at this point I think they may be right.And the bokeh is superb!So far I've only used it on the D700. No doubt within a few days I also will see how it behaves on the D80 and the D300s."
5,A New Look at Kira,"I think that probably one of the things that had been overlooked by DS9 until this episode is what the Bajoran resistance did during the Occupation, from not entirely rose-colored glasses. They often looked at Gul Dukat and what he did and it's great to look at Kira in a similar manner. I think that one thing that got put on the backburner in the series is what it means to fight for a cause and what that means doing sometimes and that's not always pretty. Again, it shows that DS9's characters are not infallible and Nana Visitor pulls it off quite well, maintaining the charcter the audience knows, but adding new dimensions."
5,Kira is kidnapped!,"Kira's close friends on Bajor are being killed in vicious sadistic attacks and Kira is next. In an explosive scene Kira is kidnapped by a deformed Cardassian who wants to kill her, but realises she is carrying an 'innocent' child. He claims that his nature is not like her's he won't kill the unborn baby, like Kira did. Kira realises that the Cardassian must have been an innocent casualty during one of her raids during the Occupation.Trapped on an isolated planet, heavily pregnant, Kira must protect herself and the O'Brien's child that she is carrying! Brilliant!""The darkness cannot exist without the light!"""
2,Vandenburg And Freud,"Vandenburg loves hysteria, female repression, and of course, dildos. And while she is an excellent theorist, her writing is juvenile. If you like Sex in the City a la 1920s Paris but minus the wit (and the great clothes), then An American In Paris is the ice cream for you. Vandenburg knows how to pop a cherry with aplomb, but this type of self-masturbatory prose is self indulgent. Not only is the movie better- I'd watch it for dessert instead."
5,Very Good Seller!,"Very Good Seller!!! The things that I ordered for my wife arrived on time and it is great, Thank You!!"
4,"It's a lens cap, what can I say?",It fit properly and appears to be genuine Nikon (crazy to think that there are counterfit lens caps out there)...
4,Fits like a charm,This fits my Nikon 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR AF-S Nikkor Lens perfect. It's too bad I lost my old lens cap and had to purchase a new one. I'm giving this 4 stars because the price is just crazy. It's just a lens cap but hey its a brand name lens cap. I mean it's my fault for losing it in the first place.
4,A Great beginner SLR camera,"I bought this camera to learn how to take great pics. This camera is definitely worth it. Especially for the price it sells for nowadays (I paid nearly $300 for mine when I got it). The N55 takes great shots and is easy to learn on. After using this camera I feel I am ready to upgrade in the near future.There are problems with this camera that Nikon has acknowledged. After 3 years of using this camera (I think) my camera is exhibiting these autofocus problems. Go to this link if you are having an issue and Nikon will fix your camera for free, or refund you if you've already had this problem fixed and paid for it:http://www.nikonusa.com/email_images/nikonusa/service_advisory/n55.html"
3,Autofocus Problem is now recognized and repaired by Nikon,"After a year and a half of satisfied ownership, this camera's autofocus system suddenly failed. Nikon now admits the problem and repairs your N55 at no charge to the owner. Better late than never, here's the advisory from Nikon with their repair center shipping information:http://www.nikonusa.com/email_images/nikonusa/service_advisory/n55.htmlOtherwise this camera has been a very good value for me. Good luck with yours . . ."
4,I recommend this camera.,"It's easy to use. It's light weight. It takes great pictures too! At first,I was disappointed because of the plastic body, but I later enjoyed the fact that this is a light weight camera. I also enjoy the automatic focusing and the easy film loading. The 55N has a built in flash that pops up automatically when the light is not sufficient or if extra light is needed to soften a picture. I would recommend the additonal purchase of a ""circular polaring filter"" because it greatly enhances your photos. You can find one on Amazon. This is a sofisticated camera that is easy to use and has made me a better photographer. I highly recommend this camera."
1,DO NOT BUY,I got this camera as a bithday gift. I just realived that the AF doesn't work (shutter won't work with AF). It did make really good pictures for a while. I only made about only 500 pictures on it. I will buy a digital next.
4,versatile and easy to use,"This is my first SLR camera. It's very easy to load the film. The auto-focus is extremely sharp; the image quality is vivid; the colors are beautiful. It is also easy to use the manual functions; I'm a beginning photographer, but I feel like I have a lot of control over its functions and the way it focuses. My only complaint is that the aperture in the included lens is small; it only opens up to about three, and doesn't always allow that consistently -- the lens closes up whenever I zoom out."
1,AF will stop working on Nikon N55,Do not buy this camera. Mine took lovely pictures for the first two rolls then the AF (auto focus) stopped working. A quick look at online message boards and other Amazon reviews of this camera suggest that this is a VERY widespread problem that Nikon apparently refuses to recognize as a design or manufacturing defect. I have owned nothing but Nikon cameras for over 30 years but this will be my last.
1,Unfortunate,"I don't think that this was the worst episode of Star Trek ever, as some people maintain, however, it certainly is a DS9 lowpoint. There's nothing wrong with a lightweight episode, it's just that LHWIWS tries to be dramatic and foolish at the same time - Worf's story of a childhood incident seems so forced that it robs the character of credibility. The only plus side is that you get nice location scenery and the cast in swinsuites - only enough to impress Baywatch fans."
1,Taking shots at family values? Why?,"The story takes place on Risa, the famous (or infamous) ""pleasure planet"" mentioned in other Trek episodes. Worf and Dax arrive on Risa to take their relationship to the ""next step"". Dax meets an old lover (from one of her previous hosts) who wants to shut down Risa because it is not a moral place.Okay, that's fine. But why portray people with strong morals and beliefs as nuts and radicals? I know Trek has always leaned a bit to the left, but this episode is ridiculous. This episode takes cheap shots at every man or woman who does believe that casual sex is wrong. I guess the creators and writers of DS9 think that half of DS9's fans are just plain nuts. This episode is insulting and an attack on those of us who have differing points of view. Plus, it is was too preachy.Bad episode, worse than ""Rejoined"", which took plenty of cheap shots, too."
5,Good Book,The analysis given to Shakespeare's sonnets is immecable. The authors know what they are writing about. I particularly liked the introduction and the end of the book interpretation with the first words of each of the sonnets.
1,Kindle edition lacks explanatory notes,"I just received my Kindle today. Thusfar, I'm quite pleased with the device but my first digital purchase is a disappointment. The Amazon description states the following:Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on the page facing each sonnet* A brief introduction to each sonnet, providing insight into its possible meaning* An index of first lines* An essay by Professor Lynne Magnusson, a leading Shakespeare scholar, providing a modern perspective on the poems* Illustrations from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books.None of this is true. I suspect that Amazon's editors have failed to see that the Digireads.com editions of various books differ from the paper editions."
1,This book does not match the reviews on Amazon,"This book has no table of contents, no annotations and no index. The painting on the cover is not identified. Since these sonnets are available in many places, free of charge, and there are several other inexpensive editions with a table of contents, index and other information, it is difficult to understand why anyone would buy this particular book. If you look carefully you can find a date on the bottom of the last page. The date is 11 January 2012. I received my copy 13 January 2012. One of the other reviews is dated 2004 and some of them refer to it as a Folger's library edition. This is not a Folger's library edition as some of the other reviewers have indicated. There certainly seems to be a mismatch between the reviews on Amazon and the book I received. I returned it to Amazon the same day it arrived."
3,Broad coverage with little in-depth detail,"This book is written to cover a broad range of topics related to the drug discovery and approval process. Since so many topics are covered, there is very little in-depth coverage on any particular topic. It's suitable people who don't have any serious scientific training or experience in the industry. If you are looking for a high-level overview, this is a good book. If you would like more detailed information about any specific topic, you should probably look elsewhere. Some of the explaintions are over simplied in order for the average reader to understand. Much of the material covered in the book can be found in much greater detail by visiting the fda site or googling for the code of federal regulations. But if you do not what the FDA is or what CFR stands for, this book is probably right for you."
4,The mystery of biotechs and pharma explained,"Very strong on detail and highly informative for the non-scientist interested in the pharmaceutical and bio-tech industry.Although a slightly akward layout, it is well worth reading- and for the complete novice, infinitely rewarding the second time around."
3,"A simple, yet comprehensive introduction","It's tough to learn quickly about the complexities of pharma R&D. This is a useful guide for those new to the industry and fills in the gaps for those more experienced. Like all books of its type, it will age quite rapidly in an sector undergoing rapid scientific and organizational change."
3,Good book to discover the world of drug discovery,"If you are not a specialist in the field of drug discovery but need nevertheless to have a comprehensive knowledge of the process that starts at the discovery of a potential new drug and ends at the registration of the drug with a regulatory agency, this book is for you. The book is full of flowcharts and illustrations that help you to understand the process. It's certainly not a book for specialists, but can be really helpful for lawyers, contracts officers and everyone who works in the drug discovery industry."
2,Quark is up for sale!,"Quark is diagnosed with a fatal illness, in Ferengi tradition he begins selling off his body parts in advance, to his surprise his entire body is bought... by Brunt.When Quark realises he doesn't have the disease he is forced into an interesting situation, break the contract with Brunt or die. But if he breaks the contract he will forfeit Ferengi rule and one of the Rules of Acquisition that the Ferengi Empire was founded upon!A mediocre episode that serves to fill some air-time while the budget is saved on some big budget season finale... or so I thought."
3,What's In A Title,The title of this DVD includes QEII. I don't recall any segment regarding this liner. I sailed on this ship and loved it. The DVD did help fulfill my great interest in ocean liners. Definitely worth it and glad it's in my collection.
1,Not Your Usual Marvel,"I usually enjoy the Modern Marvel series, but this episode failed to live up to the standard. It was lackluster and uninspired. Even the narrator seemed bored. If you are interested in the Titanic, you would do much better with the History Channel or National Geographic DVDs on the subject. I purchased this DVD, partly out of interest in the Titanic and partly out of curiosity about cruise ships in general. If you want to learn about cruise ships and how they function and what goes on behind the scenes, look elsewhere."
4,Musica fortissima,This is a great retrospective of the mid-to-late 1960s work of Genovese cantante Fabrizio De Andre and it is packed with songs that recall the spaghetti western soundtracks of Morricone with edgy lyrics and Italian folk-influenced melodies. Plus there's THAT voice.
4,Serb sympathizer wish to misuse this book,"I think that it is a bit sickening that serbs and their sympathizers misuse this book to claim that ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Muslims did not take place and ""poor"" Serbia was unjustly targeted. From what happened in the Bosnian war, it is clear that serbs are racist thugs who if they could, they would exterminate all muslims with the push of a button. It is true, as Chomsky contends, that the USA and NATO absolutely did NOT interfere for humanitarian purposes; rather the massacres were a pretext to do their dirty work for ulterior motives. But to say that serbia was a victim here, well, I think that is disingenious. I wish serbs would start thinking about their animosity and murderous hatred towards Balkan muslims (""Turks"") and maybe start to come to grips with their endemic racism. ST"
4,Great for anyone who loves cruising off the coast of Maine!,"For anyone who as ever set sail around the islands of Maine, this book is a must. Having sat on Thomas Cabot's granite bench on Butter Island, I feel like I knew him. This book shares many great stories of exploring the coast of Maine and some of his family history.His summer home on Swans Island truly is a beautiful spot..... hard wood trees and all."
4,It's good...but we've come to expect more from Elton John...,"This isn't a bad album, but it's not great. That's a shame, because I really love half of the songs on this album, but the other half leave me looking for more. I personally love ""Sad Songs (Say So Much)"", ""Little Jeannie"", ""I'm Still Standing,"" ""I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues,"" ""Blue Eyes,"" and ""Nikita,"" but most of the rest of the album just doesn't meet those high points. Songs like ""Who Wears These Shoes?"" and ""Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word"" are especially disappointing. ""Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)"" would probably mean more if I were old enough to remember John Lennon (which I am not), but as it is it doesn't touch me all that much. I wait for Volume 4 of his greatest hits and wish that this album could have been a more even collection."
1,Very disipointed,"The rubber used for the squeegee is of poor quality and lost it's ability to clear water with out streaking after the first few weeks. Truly the worst squeegee I have ever bought. Had another one simular to this and it was So much better, same design but better rubber and it lasted for years. Still looking to find a better unit. Save your money and keep shopping, this one's not so good."
1,DON'T!,"I bought this product months ago, and used it 3-4 times; excellent, as long as the little screw that holds the whole thing together doesn't get lost. Mine did, and now the squeegee is unusable."
2,"Now Foods True Calm Amino Relaxer, 90 capsules",The Shipping was on time and but don't know if this product works or maybe its too soon to know. I have took half of the bottle and didn't feel and relaxing yet.. I'm still not yet convince if this product work.
2,Doesn't work at recommended dose,I see no effect from this but have only taken one at a time - as it advises.
3,"Ok, depending on your needs","I'm 26 and have suffered from anxiety and depression since I was 19. I hate the side effects associated with prescribed meds, so I wanted to try homeopathic meds. I've been on True Calm for a month (taking 3 pills a day), and though it makes me generally more patient and able to separate myself from anxious thoughts and emotions, It does nothing when I am in the middle of a full blown panic attack. This med best handles small ups and downs, so if you need it for that, I say go for it. But if you need something as strong as Xanax, this isn't it.Everyone is different though, so take this how you will ;)"
3,Its ok,"For the price the item it is nice. However not strong as a benzo I.E. xanax, clonzepam or the other medications. It does give a level feeling. It takes about 4 capsules to notice this for me. For a full blown panic attack this would not be the best to use. This would be nice for very mild anxiety and daily use."
4,It's been a week since started and I feel great,"It's been a week since started and I feel great, I am taking two pills when I wake up and I stay all day focused and calm. I believe I found the cure to my anxiety"
2,Not helpful,"Didn't notice any results. Maybe I didn't use it long enough, but I didn't notice any benefit at all. Would not recommend."
1,Don't work,Bought this thinking I could get a natural relief from my anxiety and was really hoping this would do the trick. This stuff did nothing for me. Took exactly as directed and even a higher dose and felt nothing. Actually it gave me heart burn whenever I took it. Everyone is different but I'm telling you this product is a waste of money. I gave my sister and her boyfriend 2 because they said they heard about it and they said they couldn't feel anything either. Never buying something just because reviews again!!!
3,Sometimes it works and sometimes...,"it has the opposite effect. There are times when I notice a real difference but there are other times when I feel more anxious after taking it. I'm not sure why that is, but it is."
3,True Calm,Its really hard to say how effective true calm is. I do feel like it has made a slight difference but it's hard to tell. I have been prescribed anti axneity and seretonin boosters but I was looking for more of a natural supplement insteed of a prescribed pharmaceutical. So at this time I'm debating wether to place another order. I have found a product call (NewMood) which you can find on (onnit.com) it a 5HTP enhancer seretonin booster. Simaliar to True Calm but it seem to have a better result for me at least personally. You take it at night which I found helped me sleep better especially combined with exercise.
3,Be careful,"I bought these to help with anxiety. I took one pill with breakfast and about an hour later it kicked in. It made me feel like I was on drugs. Really spacey and edgy. I hated it and decided not to try again. But everyone is different so if your looking for natural help with anxiety you will have to try out several things before you find what works for you. So far the biggest help for me has been Holy Basil gel caps and vitamins like fish oil, calcium + magnesium and dim-plus. Also yoga and getting in the habit of remembering that the irrational fears and thoughts that are creating anxiety and panic attacks are just that, irrational. :)"
3,NOW True calm capsules.,They work OK. They are natural products so it is not like taking sleeping pills. But they help you calm down a bit and get a better sleep
2,Doesn't work as described,I did as the directions said and this pill did not calm my mood in any kind of way. It seems like more of a diet pill to me. If you take it right before a meal it'll make you feel full faster.
2,Bogus!,"If you want to feel like a lazy mummy with a migraine then give these a shot. I've tried to use them in the morning, then a couple times a day, then just at night...no matter what combination/routine I try they are just not what I expected from all the positive reviews. They make me feel irritable, unproductive, and give me a headache."
3,Purchased for Son,"He said its ok, but I don't see him telling me any instant relief as of yet still too soon."
1,False Calm,I took this product multiple times and didn't have any results. I even tried taking a higher dose. I never experienced any calm feeling at all.
5,Got to me in good time.,I havent really tried it yet but has anyone used this WITH anxiety control 24 hours? cause i dont wanna try them both together and have something happen to me..
1,Good that I bought only one bottle!,"I purchased this item about a month ago and bought only one bottle to try it. At first I took two capsules at once in the morning, since I read that the recommended dosage is not enough. After about 20 minutes I had a crazy heart beat, very bad stomach cramps, diarrhea and an awful nervousness! Later that day I had panic attacks of my life! I thought maybe I took too much, so I started taking 1 capsule three times a day after meals to avoid bad stomach. After more than two weeks of such regimen I had no change what so ever in my anxiety or panic attacks (it did nothing to eliminate them), but what I did have were very bad stomach cramps (even at night) and loose stool. When I finally stopped taking these pills all returned to normal. I have more than half bottle left and of course I'm not touching it! I found that L-Theanine does help (very slightly, in large doses and for very limited time) to deal with anxiety, but in no way will it eliminate panic attacks."
1,gooby pls.,I took the recommended dose for a week only to find out that it does absolutely nothing. I tried 4 times the recommended dose with no affect. This is snake oil.
1,worthless. did nothing. save your $,"i have Tourette's Syndrome and got this hoping it would help lessen some of my tics during the day. i figured with the price being great and the good reviews it got i decided to give it a shot. i used it as directed (1 pill 3 times a day, before or between meals) and it did NOTHING. i dont see how this is getting so many great reviews when for me (and several others) it didnt do a thing."
