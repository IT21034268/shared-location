5,Smoothie and Ice Treats Recipe Book,My purchase arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. I've used several recipes and they came out perfect. It was recommended to me by my mother. I love it.
5,Great product and great value for the kit,I think that this kit is a great value for the money. That mat is comfortable and seems sturdy. Would recommend for others to purchase.
4,Good enough bang for buck,"Comfy mat and great weight/resistance bricks.The mat is very durable. After a lot of roll-ups it's still looking as new, something many expensive counterparts fail to do.Bag is a bit cheap, but serves its purpose well."
2,Bad mat,"After the 4th time using the mat it started to fall apart. Very disappointed. However, the blocks are still in great shape. Would get something different."
3,Good for the price,"For the price, you get a lot out of this purchase for a beginning yogi. However, the main part, the mat, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of quality. For me, it is not thick enough or sticky enough compared with other mats. And the instructional wall-chart is pretty useless. But, can't beat getting a free bag and blocks!"
3,lost bag and tie,"seller wroteProduct Features24"" x 68"" sticky mat72"" woven cotton strap with buckleTwo firm foam blocks 3""x6""x9""Nylon tote bag with shoulder strapYoga instruction wall chartbut I only got 24"" x 68"" sticky mat, 72"" woven cotton strap with buckle and Two firm foam blocks 3""x6""x9"" .Did you lost the bag and wall chart to me?"
3,Okay quality,"I needed a yoga set for my yoga class. Most items are quite expensive and I wasn't looking forward to buying them. I found this for a good price that had everything I needed. I also liked that it had a bag to carry everything in. The only downside is the mat. It is a little short and on the thinner side. It works for me, but may not be the best quality for intense yoga participants. I haven't used the blocks or strap yet, but I assume they are the same way. Either way, it works for my beginner's yoga class. Also, this product shipped rather quickly. I used the super saver shipping and it came very soon."
5,It was a good gift.,This did well. It was a gift for a man who was/is hesitant about yoga. It turned out to be a good thing for him and gave him a non-flashy set of equipment to try yoga out the P90X way. Thanks.
3,Good for beginners,This is a decent kit - one thing though is the mat will definately wear out on you because it is so thin. If youre someone who needs more cushioning then I would avoid this set.
3,Not what I was expecting,"The mat is great but the bag is not the same design as pictured and it is made out of the cheapest looking material, you know the kind that crinkles with every step like a cheap raincoat. And the straps are already wearing down. Other then the cheapo bag though this product is a good startup kit."
3,Valeo Yoga Kit,"Its been a month since i began yoga and so my first time using a sticky mat. This intro to a yoga kit has been good. The mat is relatively sturdy, although there is a smally snag on it (not sure if i did it with my toe or it came that way), but it does not seem to be expanding.The colour is a beautiful purple, and the bag is very sturdy and holds every thing comfortably.All and all, this kit is a good introduction to yoga for beginners. I recommend it hold heartedly."
3,yoga mat review,I wish I had found out the thickness would have like a little thicker but the mat does works ok. The bag for packing the mat and blocks is great.
1,Alaternatives to PVC yoga mats,"I discovered after receiving this item that the sticky mat is made of 90% PVC (polyvinyl chloride) by contacting Valeo re the product. PVC is dangerous to our health and environment from start to finish - in the factory, at home, and in the trash - releasing poisonous chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects. (I should have checked this prior to purchasing it, that was my error.) My hope is to make other shoppers aware that there are numerous healthy and eco friendly alternatives out there. (Gaiam, Enviromat, Prana, & so many more.) If you are doing yoga for your health and well being than it only makes sense that you are doing it on a material that supports that goal (as well as honoring our planet - PVC is so incongruent with the practice of yoga). Perhaps Valeo will phase it out if enough consumers let them know why they didn't choose their product."
1,Not a very sticky mat!,"I bought this kit thinking it was a good deal, but that turned out to not be the case. The mat after just a few weeks of use is no longer sticky and it came with a few nicks in it. I fixed the nicks with tape and I thought oh that's not so bad, but then I slid down the mat doing downward dog and hurt my shoulder, ouch! I would say buy everything separate and save yourself the pain. The blocks and the strap are good just not the mat. My old mat I had for 10 years before it finally lost it's stickiness. It cost me $20. What a deal."
3,"Very 'plastic', but ok for the price.","If you want to buy a cheap yoga set and don't mind very artificial textures, this one is ok. In hindsight I would recommend just buying a better-quality mat - I ended up not using the rest of the components of the pack."
1,not happy with the fumes from the product,"At first, I was very excited to receive this kit but then, the smell just didnt go away! I asked my neighbor about it and he said that the outgassing of the plastic materials was what was causing the smell; and that it probably wasnt health to breathe. I ended up throwing it out."
4,Great Starter Kit,"Hi,I found this kit to be complete. The material is sturdy and IMO quality. I mainly use the yoga mat since I only do yoga twice a week to maintain my flexibility. So far, it has remained in good shape, even in the desert heat and humidity. All in all, for the money, I'd buy this item again.Take care,Rob G"
5,Great value for exercise class.,"I purchased this product for my daughter for Christmas and then got another one for myself. We use these during our cooldown after our Zumba class. For the price, it is a great value. The blocks are a real bonus!"
3,Mat Quality,The Yoga kit is fine except that the floor map is too thin. It provides only a modest cushion for the back.
3,valeo yoga kit,the yoga mat is nice. it feel good when i lay on it to do my abs work out. this is my first yoga mat. i have not use the block yet but they feel good. the only this i dont like about this yoga kit is the cheap bag that come with it. it seem if i put the mat and the block in the bag it will rip. its not bad for what i had to pay for it.
2,Yoga carrying case stains yoga mat,"I used the carrying case with the blocks and mat. However, if the case gets wet (when it is raining) it stains the mat. I have not be able to remove the stain with soap, oxyclean or grease remover.Valeo Yoga Kit"
4,Good Value,"This is a good value for the money overall, but I was disappointed when my kit arrived that the mat and blocks were a different color purple from each other. The yoga strap is natural in color as well, not white, as pictured. Also, the poster is pretty lame. I've had the kit for over a year now and it's holding up well to my almost daily use. The mat is showing lines where it will eventually split all the way through, though. I don't know how much longer I have until that happens, but that happens to the best of mats, I'm sure.This is a good deal for the money. It would have been nice if the color was that as represented in the picture on the website. I did end up contacting amazon and Valeo about it. I would have had to take a $10 loss through shipping costs to get any refund, so it clearly wasn't worth it. In the end, this works just fine & looks aren't everything."
1,You get what you pay for,"I got this mat to practice prenatal yoga at home, it was fine for that purpose for the months I used it while I was pregnant. Recently I started using the mat again for a power yoga class at my gym, it didnt take long for me to realize how terrible this mat really is. On my carpet at home I didnt notice how thin the mat is but on the hard gym floor it barely feels like there is anything under me. Apparently the sticky wore off during my prenatal practice because now my hands slip so badly downward dog is impossible to hold for more then a few seconds. I had to stop using the mat because it is completely ineffective and could actually cause harm because I slip so badly on it. It was fine for about 4 months at home, the block and strap are fine, the bag is pretty ugly, but it works for storage. I would never recommend this item."
5,Excellent Product,This product is great! It is of good quality and the price was amazing. I use it all of the time and would recommend it to others.
3,Does the job for the price point,"I purchased this yoga set because I needed a mat, but thought it would also be nice to have the blocks and the straps. I used the mat once, but it was so slippery that I found it distracting during my yoga classes, so I ended up getting a better, less slippery mat. It was more expensive but worth it. Instead of returning this set, I'm using the mat & blocks as a back up for my at home practices."
2,sticky but not good,"This mat does stick well to the floor but also sticks well to your body, especially when you are sweaty which you will be during yoga. So that is very very annoying. Also at certain location where there is deep impact/contact with the foot especially, during the downward/upward dog positions, the mat tends to crack and the material starts peeling off creating potholes in the mat! For its price its ok but not the best product.The blocks are good. I have not yet felt the need for the strap so cannot comment on that."
2,"Mediocre mat quality, blocks and the strap are fine!","I was disappointed with the mat quality. I used it on a wooden floor in my living room and the mat seemed to slip a little and the thickness of the mat just wasnt there. I used the mat for diff purposes apart from Yoga (like Push ups) and one cant rest ones palms on the mat for long (especially once they are a little sweaty in the middle of the workout) as the mat doest provide a very good grip.Okayish for its price, I would recommend you put in $10-15 more and research for a better product."
2,not worth it,"Mat is too slippery to do anything on. I can't even hold a semi decent downward facing dog on it. Only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because the blocks, belt and case are usable. Spend a little more for a better mat."
1,"lying ""grandmaster""",The author lies about his background so that one might think he knows what he is talking about. Don't believe it. If you can't trust him on his past then how do you trust his system. I found several things that if one tries then the outcome is more likely damaging. Find a teacher and do some research but stay away from Soto.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! RIDDLED WITH SERIOUS ERRORS!!!,"I just received this software to help me prepare my son and niece for the SAT exam. In the first 30 minutes we used it, there were 4 spelling errors and 1 serious content error. I am pursuing a refund."
4,Magical,"Although the ensemble is not really known as far as I know, they sound very nice. Unlike many other Andalusian ensembles, their music relies heavily on the solo oud."
5,This book Rules (no pun intended!),"This is far more than just a book that rules (that is that covers advanced rules for tournament players). It explains flaws in the rules, which rules are most important and goes into how to prepare to play in tournaments and what to do while you are there so you play better.Actually, a major part of the book covers neat openings and my favorite part is on PATTERN RECOGNITION where you try and find the best tactical solution.The book actually covers many different things and some things may be more important than others depending on the person. But I found every part of the book to have information that was very useful."
5,No other chess book is like this great work!,"""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" will appeal to many different levels of chess players at all ages. Since this book covers such a very large range of things there will certainly be opinions as to which chapter is most important. What I can guarantee is that unless you are a strong master you will learn many new things in this book.I have read the other reviews as well as this author's other books in his series (with his other 2 books being ranked #1 & #2 chess books on Amazon) and Robert Snyder's books are the most popular series without any doubt.Therefore, I will just point out without going into detail that I consider the chapters on Psychology, Pattern Recognition, Openings and How Tournaments Work to be very unique and outstanding. Each of these chapters deserves an award! This is because the information will definitely improve your game and performances in tournaments."
5,So Much Awsome Stuff!,This book is Awsome because it game me so many new things that I didnot know about when I was allready playing in tournaments. It is very easy to understand for someone in 6th grade.
4,A good follow-up to a great start,"Apparently some people don't like this album. So be it. This band has followed up on their first album with a more polished approach to their music. The style is much the same as on the first CD, but with a more musical approach. The engineering might leave a little to be desired, but I couldn't do any better. This album has a good blend of old and new, and they've branched out with the addition of new sounds and instruments. If you like the first album, this one won't dissappoint you either."
1,No Progress,"This second cd was at the most a disappointment. the continuity of the music has been lost from the first one. each song has potential, but lacks any unique qualities. the band seems to be copying, ""same ole story"" type lyrics, with an evident over-striving for a certain sound they've heard before, and not reaching inside for their own sound. the guitar licks are contrived and non-explosive, like he is hiding something from the world. They have the sound of pampered and arrogant boys who think the world owes them something. i do NOT recommend this cd to anyone except groupies. and they will no doubt be disappointed too at the lack of enthusiasm in that department also."
5,More Happy Smiles,We have two boys that just love this music collection. They seem to play it morning and night and demand we take it in the car even on short trips. As parents we find it equally educational as the kids find it entertaining. Thanks to Miss Wiggles our kids have happy smiles. I got the tunes in my head all day and find my self singing out loud at times.
4,"3-AM -love this film, especially the taxi driving scenes, where home boy keeps getting in accidents after being giving his final","Great film, the taxi driving scenes, are straight up NY! The film content was very playful, yet progressive. Very entertaining to follow!"
4,Enjoyable!,"Enjoyed this movie with one of my favorite actors, Danny Glover. It was serious, suspenseful, with a little comedy added in."
1,Lousy,"I kept wating for a real story line, was there one? The movie developed the characters but no one was given a real story. Waste of time movie."
1,not impressed,I received a damaged copy that would not play after ten minutes or so. I saw enough to let me know that it would have been a waste of my time to ask for a replacement.
2,Not working out of the box,"I bought this product for my 10 year old. It worked in the demo mode. When we opened the box and installed the roomie it still did not work out of demo mode. We tried new batteries and reset the system several times to no avail. After inspecting and looking at a friends, I noticed the little plug in for the roomies were not there on hers like they were on the others. I returned it to the store with no problem, torn box and all. I feel this would be a fun idea, she decided to buy a ds game instead of returning it."
3,Roomies Wanted,"My daughter wanted this thing for months, ever since her grandmother bought a Roomie thinking that she had the apartment. I ordered one from amazon and was so dissappointed when it didn't work even after i changed the batteries i returned and ordered another to get it two days before christmas. It didn't work either, it was stuck in demo mode!!! Until i looked at the back and saw a little piece of paper still stuck in the demo slot next to the reset hole, i just stuck one of the million little wires we had from open toys and swiped it back and forth. FIXED! Happy Daughter. I just wish i could find the roomies in the store. But i suspect this toy has had some problems and it not going to be available for long."
3,cute and portable,This toy was purchased for my 9 year old daughter. She had the smaller babysitter pixel chix house so this was purchased to go along with that. The two connect and can be used together. This is a good toy for long car rides! A few glitches when the toy arrived-nothing a new battery could not fix though.
4,Engaging,"The toy has been engaging for my niece. It still is in one piece after two weeks.It would have been nice if there were more roommates available. And it would have been nice if the computer cord could be used though the computer's headset jack instead of though the computer's speakers. Also, the batteries were dead upon arrival, so initailly we thought the toy was broken. Thankfully, it was only the batteries.My niece enjoys the toy, so we are happy with the product."
4,"The Battleship Boys' First Step Upward or, Winning Their Grades as Petty Officers","This is an interesting book in that it was written almost 100 years ago and there is a much different writing style than in current writings. Further, it deals with patriotism, honour and doing your duty from the viewpoint of the main characters of the book more so than is now the norm. The main characters also have an aura of innocence about them which makes them rather likeable. It was a good read and also gives you an idea about shipboard life around the time of World War One. It was a good adventure."
1,Not good for MY teeth!,"I've been using this toothpaste for about 5 years now. I began to use it because Consumer Reports said that it was actually the one whitening toothpaste that worked. In that case, I guess I should give it a higher rating, although I'm not sure my teeth are any whiter. With whitening pastes there is a price to pay in that they tend to be abrasive and wear down the enamal, and I believe that is my problem. I am now making the connection that since using this product, I have been to dentists (general, endontists and periodontists) more times than I can remember for broken teeth, root canals, root extracts and crown restorations. I have spent a fortune! I am going to stop using this product immediately and switch to something that is better for enamel strengthening."
1,"If You're Not A Coffee Drinker Or Smoker, This Won't Do A Thing","I used the paste day and night and it did nothing. I don't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth. This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above. I just didn't see a different after about 2 weeks of use. If you want a whitening paste, try a better quality brand."
4,Cleans Teeth But Be careful,"Ultra brite, made by Colgate is very good at removing coffee and presumably tea stains. it is quite abrasive and contains other materials which make it , I think, ideally suited for this. However, it's abrasiveness has a downside; too much rubbing over an extended period of time MAY wear down the tooth enamel. As such, I use it only after drinking coffee and don't rub too vigorously. it does a great job of keeping stains off my teeth and does have fluoride to help protect my teeth. Other than after drinking coffee, I use Cavity Prevention Crest. But Ultra Brite is great for it's intended purpose."
4,Our Toothpast of Choice,"We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which, in my opinion, simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change."
4,Cute but noisy,This book is cute and great photo book for children. I did not know or like that the pages make a crinkly noise when you touch them.
3,Disposable Dogs,"To think that these dogs were disposed! How many more have died suffering or been euthanazed - what wasted lives! But their luck turned around and for it, both people and these dogs lives were enriched; some even saved their saviours.I think the message this book tries to send out is: next time you see a stray, don't think of it as a nuisance but a life that has value and deserves to be on this planet; a life that could have given so much love and care, if only his/her circumstances were different.It's a good read, if only just to enlighten people."
5,book,"I bought this for my kindle..good book..good reading..I would recommend this book, if you like this type of book..5 Stars for the seller."
4,Disposable Dogs,"A nicely written book w/ vignettes about dogs who found homes, and the joy and gratitude that comes with this...both on the human and animal side of the fence. This is a quick read, but one that is heartwarming as a solid argument for adopting shelter or ""disposable"" dogs."
4,Great Book,This is a great book that shows what alot of dogs go through and how they really are worth something to someone. You will see by reading this book that some people were not meant to own dogs and they do feel they are disposable. Really great stories of wonderful people and the resilience of the dogs!
2,Poorly Written,"As an advocate for animal welfare and volunteer at multiple shelters, I was really excited to read this book. However, to my disappointment it is not very well written...the stories are underdeveloped and boring. This type of collection has a lot more potential than this, and these dogs deserve a better tribute. However, I do applaud the idea behind the book and wish more people had compassion for animals."
3,"They had me at ""Mongloids!""","The movie starts right off with the two male leads singing and as a musical, it does work. The songs actually make the story better. I knew nothing about Colma but by the job interview scene, I totally understood what they meant about living in a stalled, dead end town. This movie has more personality and feels more personal than many attempts to make a buddy/coming of age film. I'm looking forward to seeing Fruit Fly by the same writer and starring the female lead. But I lost interest in Colma halfway through."
2,Disappointing...not what I expected,"I had heard great things about this. I guess I interpreted musical to mean soundtrack over people singing the story lines. The singing is too muddled to keep track of what's going on.Interesting concept, execution falls short."
5,The intelligence in action!,"Taking a certain advantage about the well expected humane male condition , a tough , sassy working girl tries to get her award in the middle of this state of things . Excellent dramatic comedy around the exploitation of the woman in Japan.A critic said once an interesting point of view about Mizoguchi presence in Japan ; he compared him with Bch while Kurosawa was associated with Beethoven. And if I may Mizoguchi is to me the visual equivalent to Tiziano .Kenji was always worried for the sense injustice and cruelty exerted over the woman in Japan . A good proportion of his films shows us over and over this unfortunate state of things in his homeland .Try and get close to Mizoguchi universe .You will be shocked and engaged immediately for his craft."
1,Drive By Transformation,"It always amazes when consulting firms produce tomes such as these with the expectation that a relatively shallow skimming of the waters combined with quotes from firm clients is enough to impart ""wisdom to the masses"". Even as a KPMG advertisement it fails; there is not enough depth, thought, or original thinking to interest anyone in retaining them to help ""transform"" their business. In the pantheon of business books it ranks near the bottom - stick with some of the classics, or better yet - read HBR, Wired, Upside, or Red Herring for a better picture of digital trends and their impact on business."
5,Internet Common Sense,"With so much Internet hype over the past few years, it is refreshing to see a common sense analysis of how to integrate the new ecommerce concepts into your business. McCarthy brings a refreshingly clear and understandable perspective to the ecommerce challenge. This book is a must read for senior executives struggling to develop an Internet strategy. I read it in one sitting, and found myself writing action items in the margins of almost every chapter. By the end, you are looking for McCarthy's phone number, for KPMG obviously has thought long and hard about how to adapt your business to the ecommerce age. This is an exceptional book. It is succinct, imaginative, and practical. Buy it. Read it. Use it. If you don't, your competitors will."
2,Basic reading emphasizing concepts much less alive today....,"This is a good book to get a quick study on some basic e-business, however, it is dated and does certainly not intent to spark any ideas.If you desire to read stuff more profound and more connected to real business, pick something else, for example, 'Seven Steps to Nirvana' from Mohan Sahwney from Kellogg School of Management."
1,Uninspiring Words from a Master Showman,"Patel, one of the most notorious used-car salesmen in the Big Five consulting world, has most assuredly reserved his place in the clueless hall of fame with this book. Rather than focusing on those who make or break eBusiness initiatives, the dreaded ""Customers"", Patel chooses to buy into the nonsense that large organizations should rebuild themselves around their technology.Of course, this is the same line the Big 5 have been handing their clients for years, first with ERP, then CRM, and now ""eBusiness"". Can you think of the last time a Big 5 firm actually ""transformed"" a Fortune 500 company? I can't.Readers who are looking for inspiration to break themselves out of the ""old economy"" mindset of corporate heirarchy and politics, as well as technology for technology's sake, are best served elsewhere. I suggest The Cluetrain Manifesto by Christopher Locke et al. It's a better read and sure as hell more likely to get you to embrace the New Economy."
5,Very practical,"I always wanted to directly talk to people who really transformed corporations, in this e-business age. This is one of the rarest opportunity, where you get to read them through their unique style of thought sharing process. Outstanding book, I sincerely recommend to every one who really want to know how to steer their enterprises into leadership position by offering best customer services by using this ubiquitous tool called ""The internet""."
4,Black Metal with emotion,"The thing you gotta bare in mind about Carpathian Forest is that they are very much into misanthropy and pure narrow-mindedness. They say so flat out. I am a black metal musician myself, and I understand how one might think these songs to be Black metal for punk fans, but I will GUARANTEE you if you approached these guys and said, ""hey, your songs are too simple to be true black metal."", their response would be ""Thats all you f**king deserve you whiny little b*tch!!"" Carpathian Forest, for that reason could be called emo-black metal, since the majority of their songs are about pure hatred and rage, rather than being about impressing the listener with a bunch of technical riffing, epic songwriting, or symphonic back-up. If you're more into technical riffing then I reccomend Immortal. If Symphonic Black metal is your thing, try Cradle Of Filth or Dimmu Borgir. If you want pure relentless narrow-minded misanthropic black metal, Carpathian Forest is about the best there is."
3,Dissapointed...a 3.5,"At first the guide is wonderful, and stays that way as long as you only follow the main quests. When you start the side quests it becomes a bit of a challenge...for instance one quest tells you to go to page ""???"" to find more information! Well that was awful nice of them...the guide is supposed to help not confuse!Since this is the only guide in paper form get it, because it's worth it for the main quest, and the art book is pretty cool. Definitely get this one over the normal guide."
1,Great while it lasted!,"The scale is everything the manufacturer claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components. I suspect that poor Q&A; will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing on it...).Conclusions:* Scale design is nice--looks good.* Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very strong. Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is rather poor.* Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies.* Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections.Hope this helps!"
4,"Beautiful Design, Tricky to Program","The scale is beautiful and easy to read. However, it is difficult to set up properly. Read the instructions through to the end before you begin setting it up. Make sure you use the ""convert"" button on the back to convert from Kilos to Pounds, BUT make sure you convert to American pounds rather than British ""stone"" pounds!Also be very careful when you are setting up the machine to ""zero"" the scale properly. It is the final button push and if you press the button too hard, you will throw off the scale. I thought the scale was broke (it was weighing me ten pounds light) until I realized this. You have to pinch the area where the button is rather than just push the button or else you are pushing on the scale and causing that pressure to be zero'd. Hope that makes sense, but it is essential to getting the scale to work properly.I do love that you only have to step on it to cause it to activate and find the right person and that it's accurate to .2 pounds."
1,pretty looking piece of junk,Stopped working after one day! Show scrambled characters on the LCD. This scale was probably made for aliens since its reading is not legible to the human eye. Returned it.
3,probably good,"this was probably a good scale, I used it for a few mins and it seemed accurate, but it arrived broken in the box, the buttons at the top of the scale were loose in the box and the plastic clips to secure it were broken, I shouldn't have to super glue a new item so I didn't use."
1,Awful quality,"I bought this scale a year ago. The first unit I got broke within a month, simply stopped working. Amazon replaced it. This one is now broken too, simply stopped working. (Note: It was not a battery issue, I tried replacing them).If that isn't enough to dissuade you, the UI is hopeless, you'll need to refer to the instructions any time you want to do something more than the basic measurements. The accuracy of the non-weight measurements leaves something to be desired as well.Finally, if you're still in love with it because of its looks (as I was), be warned that this scale collects dust, lots of dust. Also, the bottom piece is made of very cheap-looking (and cheap-feeling) plastic.Do not buy it.Sorry about the rant format of my review :)"
1,BROKEN!,"As soon as i received this product, it was broken, despite the fact that i bought a new, not used product. The screen would only show parts of numbers or would be completely blank. I don't think online purchasing is the way to go about buying scales. I want to make sure it works before i purchase it from now on, so I would recommend going to an actual store."
4,A lot can happen between Monday and Wednesday ...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Zoe's woes don't just happen on Wednesday, the drama touches every day of the week. Especially since Zoe is catching it from all angles--current man with baby's mama drama; ex-man who still wants to be the next man; family members who can get on the first and last nerve. What's a women to do? Pick up and run away from home? Hey, that is a thought. But Zoe toughs it out and what she does should surprise everyone. Being born on Wednesday does have its advantages. Hats off to Gayle Jackson Sloan. You'll also enjoy Saturday's child. Naleighna Kai, author of Every Woman Needs a Wife."
4,Another great story by Sloan!,"Gayle Jackson Sloan has done it again. She has written another story that is so real, so emotional that you feel as if you know the characters personally. There aren't many books that make me emotional, but Saturday's Child and Wednesday's Woes did.Sloan has become one of my favorite authors and one who's works I will snatch up as soon as they hit the shelves."
4,DIFFERENT NAME FOR WHAT WAS ONCE A BETTER BAND,"When I first her THE DECKARD EP, I was filled with the same sort of anger and disappointement that many metallica fans felt when LOAD first came out. Nonetheless, I was thrilled that there was still hope for Baby Chaos, one of my favorite bands. But they were my favorite because of there antisocial edginess, like if a grunge band would have, only sparkled with musicality that would be traced back to Radiohead. That was the real brilliance of rock music in the early 90's. In a very homosexual way (no offense to anyone...) DECKARD sill rocks. The combination of heavy guitars etc. with hypersensitive ""getting-in-touch-with-your-feminine-side"" lyrics leave me at times excited and confused. Where I love the blazing wall of sound, the lyrics and basically the whole attitude behind the album make me cringe. So I give them 4 stars. I guess, being a male chavunist, I just prefer the female legs covered in blood to the stary-eyed pouty pink lips of DECKARD."
2,Not what Deckard wanted,"The vocals of stereodreamscene are way too soft. Chris wanted to pull in the reings a litte on the vocal aspect, but went way too soft, and didn't realize it until it was too late. ""What Reason"" is the only song I care for on the album. Deckard lost their attitude from their BC days. Suddenly they are singing about love! BC had their own agenda, and were rarely concerned with love. If I didn't know who BC was, I would never buy stereodreamscene."
5,It works,"It's a coffee pot, and it works.It fits in our Braun coffee maker, as some more generic ones didn't work after our original cracked."
5,agogo blocks,".......these are a sweet addition to your percussion setup....compact,good sound and LP quality....super price with very low s&h from Brook Mays ...get em....."
4,Amazing debut by future vocal jazz greats,"The debut recording by vocal jazz group New York Voices suffers from poor production and some synthetic sounds that partly cloud the quality of the music. Most of the time the three gals and two guys seem to be singing at the top of their (New York) voices but still sound tinny and too far back in the mix. Anyway, the music's great, the fantastic arrangements of standards (such as Caravan and the a bit overlong Round Midnight) as well as the intriguing original material (National Amnesia, Dare The Moon, Street Party). Hard to believe their later albums would get even better."
2,Not a pair of monitors!,"I ordered these monitors in Sept. 2005. The ad shows Event's list price of $699/pair. Music 123's sale price at 57% off is $299. However after ordering them I received a confirmation for only 1 speaker at $299.50 (only 14% off list!). After some wrangling with Customer Service (I had to fax a copy of their ad to them) they said that Music 123 ""does not sell pairs of Event speakers, only single speakers"" and that the advertised list price and savings were in error. I would have to pay for a second speaker. So I returned the speaker and they paid for the return shipping. I'm waiting for them to credit my account."
3,No closed captions OR subtitles!,"Some people, like me, do not have perfect hearing. I appreciate it when a dvd isn't closed captions has at least subtitles. These DVDs have neither. If it had one or the either, it would be worth four stars.Come on BCI, get with the program!!"
2,Not half as good as the first,"I happened to stumble upon Sarmago's first book in an airport, and the next thing I knew was I didn't want the plane to land because the book, ""Blindness"" was so good. It was one of the few books that I've read and actually thought about years later. Maybe that book was so good I was expecting ""Seeing"" to be a continuation of it, but it wasn't. My advice to readers is if you enjoyed ""Blindness"", let the story end there."
3,"Saramago is must-reading, Seeing is not","Jose Saramago must be read, but Seeing is not must reading except for Jose fanatics / addicts. Get hooked on the Jose experience with Blindness for its language, gripping story line, and the raw beauty of Saramago's eccentric narrative style. Seeing delivers much of the same but lacks compelling plot development resulting in a work of art difficult to appreciate."
3,Curious,"Does this story, Seeing, follow-up with the characters in Blindness? How they clean up their city, restart their lives, etc.?"
3,Ultimately unsatisfying after a strong start,"I really appreciated the first two-thirds of the book--it's a sharp, funny, on-target satire, written in a most appealing style. But I had a problem with the transition to the investigation--I felt it to be almost anticlimactic. Up to this point, the satire gets larger and more far-reaching, and all of a sudden we are in a micro-mode, focusing on the three detectives. I started turning the pages faster and faster, asking myself why he decided to divert the story in this way. Yes, I understand his overall theme and the point of the novel, and after some thought, I sort of understand what he was trying to do with the shift in focus. But I just don't think it works all that well."
3,"Don't think of it as a sequel, review by 17-year old","I enjoyed Blindness, and expected Seeing to be made of the same material: lyrical, nerve-wrecking, bewildering. Like its precursor, Seeing juxtaposes witty dialogue with somber lines that evoke reflection, but in other respects the two books are dissimilar. Seeing is nearly as compelling as Blindness, but it's funnier, and with less real substance-- less happens.I'd suggest readers to think of Seeing not as a sequel to Blindness, though obviously the two books are related, but as a stand-alone book in the same universe. This way, they won't have any unfair expectations; this way, they can appreciate Seeing as a humorous companion to Blindness, and not get caught up in the second book's relative lack of depth and hasty resolution. After all, one can hardly criticize the author for keeping his style fresh."
4,Not as good as blindness,Saramago is an incredible writer. I picked this up having enjoyed reading Blindness many times (you really should read it before this one). I wasn't expecting a heavy-handed political allegory but the story is pretty good. It will not leave you as awe-struck as Blindness but Saramago's writing style is always wonderful and will leave you with much to think about.
1,I could not finish the book,"I guess I was looking for a sequel to Blindness and this book is defintely not a sequel to Blindness. Book could have been good, but after reading first 40 - 50 pages, I could not bring myself to devoting more time to finish this book."
5,Nancy ekholm Burkert illustrations/St. Lawrence River,this is a really wonderful story of a young boy and a beautiful spot in Canada.Memere and Pepere and conflict in a family. This book has a characters that you will remember long after you have read it. The boys journey to reunite his family is both touching and wonderful. A hopefull tale with really wonderful illustrations by one of the greatest illustrators of childrens books. A do not miss and great book to keep forever
4,Great Guide For Mississippi Delta Blues,"So much has been written on the historic sites of the Mississippi Delta Blues, but finding these great lost spots is another thing - until this book. The book was invaluable in touring the Delta and finding the hard-to-find graves, juke joints, etc. The book allowed me to find the famed house where Robert Johnson was allegedly poisoned in 1938. Beautiful. The problem is, these kinds of books are outdated the moment they are published, but with Bird's guide to historic sites, you can't go wrong. Wonderful guide for anyone into the Theater of the Obscure."
2,sticky buttons,"I keep the blackjack game in my purse and use it at doctor's offices or wherever else I need to wait. Much better than germ-filled magazines. However, the major button sticks,and I often ""lose"" because the game automatically gives me another number when I prefer to ""stop."" Very frustrating."
2,Thought @ this price it would have a backlight,"Received this today (was hoping the tutorial/hint option would improve my skills & give me pointers but it doesn't) & am a little disappointed. Not only does it not include a backlight @ this price, the ""hints"" are off more often then not. It plays ok. But, 9 times out of 10 when it tells me to hit (on the inevitable 12-16) & I do, I lose. It even tells me to hit on 19 or 20! Would not recommend it for the tutorial value nor for the price. It should be about a $10 game."
1,Not well made,"First of all, the wig was too small. Secondly, the material for the ""boots"" was different for each foot. Thirdly, the ring inside the dress was broken."
1,"VERY small foot sock, short laces","I ordered mine in black, tore the ribbon from sock a bit just trying to fit it to my foot, I have large feet, but all be it, the sock is square!..lol..and the laces are not made for larger calves either.."
4,Not bad,"I'm a big fan of the Negima manga, and found the first four volumes of the anime hugely disappointing. However, the last two volumes were much better; the writers struck out for themselves, instead of following the manga with just enough pointless changes to ruin it. This volume includes the climax, centered around Asuna, and is quite enjoyable, even though it has no basis in the manga whatsoever."
3,"Not perfect, but very worthwhile","As noted by B. Cathey, this double-bill of operas rarely staged outside of Russia is very well sung. But the picture quality is so washed out that background sets are almost invisible. The tenor singing the role of Mozart is a mite long-in-the-tooth for someone supposedly only 35 years old & the prompter in this production is so loud that he deserves billing along with the 2 principals. Otherwise, a worthy addition to any serious collection of operas on DVD."
4,"Very good performance, vintage video","This double bill of rarely performed Russian operas by Dargomyzhsky and Rimski-Korsakov dates from the 1980s. Both Bolshoi productions are quite well sung, staging is fine (if a bit spare). Don't look for state-of-the-art digital video (were these presentations broadcast over Soviet TV?). But that shouldn't deter the devotee of Russian opera, and in particular, rarely-performed Russian opera, from purchasing this disc. Recommended."
2,cool,"awsome, this cd will blow out any other cd's . it has that great tune that you just want to tap your feet to.I gurrente you will love it"
3,A Fan and then a Critic,"Though I listen to Gay Dad's Leisure Noise quite a bit after two years, I originally thought they'd become a major band. Not so, it appears now. They avoid the sophomore slump on Transmission by scaling back their ambitions. That's both a good thing (Transmission is more direct, harder) and a bad one (its rock is often sui generis). I enjoyed the pretensions of Leisure Noise and miss them here. Which isn't to say I don't like the new CD. More than half the tracks impress me; they just don't engage me as they should. Isn't that how it is with consumer culture? One minute you're a raving fan; the next minute you're a bloody critic!"
2,Not an American Prayer Book,Note that this prayer book is authorized by the Episcopal Church of Scotland. It is not The Book of Common Prayer used by the Episcopal Church in the United States.
5,Most Valuable Resource!,"This is the most comprehensive, Bible-based prayer book I know of. I recommend it for daily, personal devotional and for weekly, corporate worship."
2,I guess I missed....,"I guess I missed the part that said ""this isn't for you..."". I too wanted the American book and, further, one whose print is readable not microscopic!. This book will be donated to a paperback exchange since I missed the deadline to return it."
4,"Excellent book, but I miss the pew format.","This particular version is quite different from the traditional pew version. It's a great book all in all, but not laid out at all like the traditional red pew version."
1,disapointed,This little book with the make believe leather and the multible misprints is not worth the price. I wish I sent it back.
3,Good but not great,"I ordered this replica to place on my desk at work, overall the quality is ok, but the field markings are a piece of paper that is glued down. I got this for around $27.00 inlcuding shipping and was excited considering other places were selling it for $100.00. I wouldn't pay over $30 for it and save up for either the platinum edition or the danbury mint version. The item is about 6"" x 6"" and about 4"" tall."
3,"In general, I liked this toothpaste. It had ...","In general, I liked this toothpaste. It had a nice mint flavor and was very mild on my sensitive teeth. It left my teeth feeling smooth and clean after use, but didn't leave a fresh aftertaste that other brands leave. The mint flavor seemed to just disappear after rinsing and left really no taste at all. I think after a week's use my teeth are a little brighter, but not really noticeably whiter -- although, that may come with longer use. I'd recommend this product for someone with sensitive teeth or gums. Just use a little mouthwash after brushing for a fresh tasting mouth!"
3,"Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with this Rembrandt ...","Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with this Rembrandt toothpaste. The first thing I noticed when I finished brushing my teeth was the distinctively bitter aftertaste (although, I'm pregnant and may be a bit more sensitive to flavors than most). I did see a slight improvement in my teeth's sensitivity to cold beverages, but I didn't see a great difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Not any more difference than with any other whitening toothpaste I've ever used (Crest, Aquafresh, Colgate, etc.). For the price and results, I wouldn't recommend this product to friends or family over any other whitening toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It was just okay."
2,My biggest complaint about was that the flavor ...,"My biggest complaint about was that the flavor was awful. It was almost like a rotten cherry-mint flavor. I just about choked the first time I used it. After repeated use, the flavor became more tolerable -- however, another flavor would be a plus. I didn't notice any whitening effect. But to be fair, more than a week's use is probably required. Other than the above comments, this was average toothpaste."
5,I found this product to be excellent. It ...,"I found this product to be excellent. It whitened my teeth several shades. The product left an awkward aftertaste in my mouth at first. But this product is definitely better at whitening my teeth than most products. However, its cost per ounce is very high. Overall, it's a great product and I'd use it again in the future."
3,I've been using the Rembrandt Whitening Toothpaste for ...,"I've been using the Rembrandt Whitening Toothpaste for five days now, and I do notice a slight whitening of my teeth. After I brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh. Because I have sensitive teeth, I liked this product a lot -- it was very gentle. I'd recommend this product to my friends and family."
3,about big city life,i would have to say that BIG CITY LIFE is a great cd for a single .it has some really good songs on it.but i would also have to say that you would have to be a really big fan of the BROADWAYS to like this cd.but if your just getting into them then go out and buy BROKEN STAR because that is there best cd and i would have to give that one 5 stars.
3,Dell's aahight,"I got it in '93 after listening to Catch a Bad One. At the time, Catch a bad one was the best lyrical hip hop joint I had heard. Overall the album is o.k. I immediately liked tracks 1,2,4 and 14. The cut with the Souls of Mischief grew on me after a while. Whether you buy it or not, you need to check out Catch a Bad One. If Dell would consistenly put out tracks like this, people would have to recognize his skills and give him some due. Of the music I have heard from Del, I wish my brother George was here is a better Album, but Catch a Bad One is Del's best track."
1,no need to buy this album,"i bought this album because I learned that Del is a local MC. When i listened to the album i learned why he is still local. Lazy, uninpired rhymes and depressingly simple beats. Oh, if Del had forgone his chance at fame and let someone worthy sign the contract. Don't bother with this one."
4,"Yes, there is need for alarm.","When many people think of hip hop today, they think of boring, annoying mainstream rap artists such as 50 Cent, Chingy, and Nelly. I cant stand any type of rap played on MTV or the radio. In fact, I dont really even consider myself much of a hip hop fan. My cd collection is mostly just rock, and filled with cds like CKY, In Flames, H.I.M., Killswitch Engage, Malevolent Creation, etc. Still, Del the Funky Homosapien is not a rapper to ignore. Although this isnt as good as the masterpiece 'Both Sides of the Brain', its still a must have with great songs. Although this is a bit of an old album, it was ahead of its time, and holds up remarkably well even today. In fact, its one hundred times better than the junky hip hop being played today. No wonder why it has had such an awful repetutation lately. For anyone with an open mind, though, this is a must have. I would check out 'Both Sides of the Brain' first, though."
4,Del shows his flow-,"Del's second release is technically stellar; the production is classic early 1990's: simple, layered, catchy loops. The real standout, however, is Del's flow. I'd call out a specific track, but each one represents a mix of traditional and (then) experimental flows. I suppose 'Catch a Bad One' is the standout.I've offended more than one woman by playing this album. Del's lyrics can come off too bravado and misogynist at first listen. I'm thinking specifically of Boo-Booheads, which sounds women-bashing initially but upon second listen reveals emotional frustration."
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. Heaven (Prelude)2. Edge Of A Hurrican3. Hold My Hand4. Laughter5. Under Lock And Chain6. Truly Helpless7. Rain In Amsterdam8. Pretty Blue Things9. See You In Person10. The Secret World11. Holes In The Floor Of Heaven12. In The Heart Of God
1,ummmm,"this book was recommended by a friend of mine. i ordered years ago and i was just reminded that i never received it. i did order it from an outsourced seller through amazon. so yeah, i'm done writing about this..."
3,Great!,I used this in my halloween costume as Brian Wilson from the SF Giants and it worked great. I had to trim it a little bit but it was perfect!
2,Good price. Bad quality.,As soon as you touch the beard all of the hair comes off. I bought about 20 for my boyfriends surprise birthday party. I'm afraid to hand them out to people that they will get fake beard hair all over the place.
3,Funny gag gift,My son wanted to get his daddy a beard for Christmas so we got this as a silly gift. It got a lot of laughs and I was happy I didn't spend more than a couple of bucks on it.
2,turn off the chorus pedals!,"I only gave this video two stars because it features Johnny Cash, an American icon to say the least. It really deserves only one star. There was something unsettling about this short live film... the background musicians were intolerable! I find it hard to see the great Mr. Cash singing so well in front of plastic guitars, one hot pink (!) no less and with the chorus on full throughout the show. It actually made me a little seasick to hear all that wavy synthetic guitar sound. Pretty good song selection, though I would have preffered to hear more of Johnny's original material rather a song written by so and so as he narrates to the viewer between songs."
3,Caveat About Stevens' Voice,"Those who have never heard Wallace Stevens read any of his poetry should be forewarned that his voice is quite weak and meek. For so large a man, his voice is as little as a mouse. The rewards for those dedicated to Stevens' poetry is, however, great. The intesity and simplicity of the meaning of the poems he reads is transmitted by the emphasis placed by his own voice. You have no doubt what the poem is about when you hear Stevens read them. That's revelatory. But those who hope to hear the stirring performance of a Dylan Thomas or the range of a Richard Burton should listen elsewhere."
4,great guide and commentary,I enjoy it and am reading it concurrent with the old testament currently. quite helpful and there are archeology notes too

3,on The Nightwalker,"Werewolves and shapeshifters have been extensively chronicled and romanticized in the most mediocre ways possible (with the Twilight series as the most famous catastrophe to date). Thomas Tessier's The Nightwalker is an intelligent, original treatment of lycanthropy, which is definitely not for people who read the work of Stephenie Meyer.The changes in Bobby Ives, the main character, may or may not be psychological in nature. The backdrop of the story is London, and there are exciting references to the underground punk rock scene. The prose styling is excellent as Thomas Tessier is also a poet."
3,I was expecting more...,"I was expecting more than I got, manly in the terms of the werewolf transformation/s, the author just made it seem like the main character was some rabided carriering psycho-path instead of a werewolf...Thats what disapointed me about this book, I have been looking for a good werewolf book and I guess this was not it.:("
4,Great complementary to your aviation library!,"Really rare and hard to find data on Israeli Phantom kills, covering every kill (many in details). Many non-seen before photos and exceptional color profiles.The information that presented in the book is the Israeli look on the Phantom air-to-air combat results. It is not a traditional ace by ace coverage, but more chronological victory by victory account, grouped by squadrons.There is also a very, very brief biography of ace pilots (not the navigators).The problem is - the Osprey book format (96pp), there is so much information, photos and details to be covered, that 96 pages are simply not enough. To compensate this, the photos are shrunk and the text is very compact. I could wish more exceptional photos to be included, as I've seen some in different sources.Bottom line, I will suggest this book to every aviation enthusiast, who deals with Middle East aviation warfare."
3,voice from hell,"I've always been a fan of Grossman (his ragtime and blues transcriptions) and Renbourn's interpretation of English traditional music. Imagine my surprise to find their double live album in the used record bin for $7! As soon as I started playing it though, something started bothering me: It was Grossman's voice. I see why none his treasured albums have any vocals. Imagine having just been served a wonderful aged steak, and having the waiter standing over you, making you dip each morsel into catchup! Nothing against New Yorker's, but Grossman's deep, deep Manhattan accent just destroys this album for me (despite some wonderful guitar work and vocals by Renbourn). Their duet on Candyman is simply obscene, with Grossman hamming up the falsetto part (c.f., Dave Van Ronk's wonderful cover). There is no chemistry between these two excellent artists."
4,Club Babylon,"Slightly dissappointed with this soundtrack. There are some good songs on this 2 disc collection, however, it wasn't as good as the season 1-5 soundtracks were."
4,Chris Cox is the man,"Love how Chris Cox mixed the first cd. I have played it over and over. There is only one song that I didn't like ""True (the faggot is you). I think he did a fantastic job. A+ Now cd 2 is full of new club songs, but they all seam to have the same sound. Kind of boring D-. If your a fan of good club music and love a really good mixed cd then buy this for the Chris Cox mix on disc one."
4,Worth it for the big QAF fan,"I would have probably given this Soundtrack 5 stars if I had been able to recognize all the music as being played at some point or another on Queer as Folk. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Nothing on the second disc really rings a bell with me, and nothing stands out in the second disc, making it kind of boring. However, I have been listening to the first disc over and over in my car, and it makes buying the soundtrack worth it. I recognize most of the songs on the first disc as being from QAF, and I really enjoy disc 1, especially the first 7 songs. If you love everything QAF, I recommend buying the Club Babylon Soundtrack."
4,A Fantastic True Story,"For about two years I have had this thing for reading true escape stories. The Flight of the Falcon is one of the best. It's a story about a smart, young, convicted spy and his escape from prison. I give it only four stars because the author kind of went over board on the whole ""follow the false leads"" thing. For 18 months they got thousands of leads that went absolutely nowhere and Boyce was well on his way to freedom. But the play by play accounts of each false lead was redundant and tedious. Lindsey took a gamble with that and won.....in my opinion. All the redundancy paid off in a big way with a truly exciting escape story."
4,good,I didn't care about the red herrings the investigators were following. I just wanted to know what Boyce was really doing. So I read only those parts of the book. Those parts were quite interesting.
4,Very informative.,"This book is very well written as far as scientific material is concerned. Having a very funadmantal understanding of such concepts as the Big Bang would prove to be helpful while reading, but not once was I utterly confused. The book is jam-packed with useful info and data. Kudos to Richard Morris for a fine book."
4,"More, more!","As a fan of Jill Churchill, I always look forward to her books. I Love that she has started a new series, and looked eagerly for the second Grace & Favor mystery. She is developing the characters wonderfully, and I am awaiting her next novel just as eagerly as her second!"
4,storyteller,A brother and sister inherit an estate in the 1930s only to find out that they don't have any money to run it so they decide to use the mansion to make money by bringing in a famous guest and have paying guests who want to hob-nob with the rich. OF course their is a murder and a mystery is born. With their usual good humor Lily and Robert continue on and eventually put all the pieces together to solve the crime. A nice change from grusome and gory murder mysteries.
1,A Complete Bore,"As a lover of a good mystery, I picked up this book because it listed Ms. Churchill as being the ""Winner of the Agatha and Macavity Mystery Readers Awards."" She obviously did not win with this piece of work.It almost reads more as a romance novel for women too ashamed to buy the books with Fabio on the cover.The outcome is predictable and the subplot is mundane at best. Not for sincere fans of mysteries."
3,Not up to the the Jane Jeffrey series,"As a big fan of Jane Jeffrey, I was very disappointed with this Grace and Favor book. The two uppity main characters in this book are not nearly as interesting as the contemporary housewife Jane Jeffrey. I could not identify with a couple of 20-ish young people of the 30's who inherit a large home from their uncle, but who have to have paying guests in order to support their expensive habits. Please give us more of Jane and less of Grace & Favor."
4,"I Like it, I Like it!!","This phase of jazz, along with 70's smooth jazz/fusion artists are my most favorite!! Now while i don't remember what the other tunes sound like on this album, the one song that REALLY stands out to me, is the title track. I briefly went through the mp3 downloads looking for another song which i have liked since I was a little young-un in 1998. Anyways, i ran across this one and 3 seconds into it, I was already pressing the purchase button! This is a song best for a bright and sunny 75 degree weather day which i truly hate we can't have up here in Michigan at this time of year lol! I will however check the rest of the songs, but the way i love this tune I'm sure my opinion will be that this very tune makes this album worth at least 4 stars. I'll give it 5 when i can honestly say that i went through all of the songs and I loved the majority of them."
2,Middle of the Road,The album is alright for background business. Not good enough to be for central listening. Older album has good memories for me!!
3,great production does not equal great songs,"There are a few cool songs on this album, but overall it was way too repetitive. Once I get to the middle section of each song, they all have the same beat and similar sounds. BP Empire doesn't live up to IM standards and seems to be lacking the creativity that we hear in the other albums, especially Converting Vegetarians. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars"
4,"It's good, but missing something","This CD is definitely an interesting one. Infected Mushroom are the masters of the weird and wacky in their music (although not as weird as, say, Wizzy Noise). IM uses a literal array of sound effects, bleeps and chirps, and twisting synths. It will make your head spin. Most of the tracks are actually pretty fun (Spaniard, BP Empire, Funchameleon), but this entire CD feels like it's missing the impact needed to make the CD almost-perfect. There is definitely better goa/psy out there that does this. But if you're looking for a fun space-techno experience, this is your album."
4,Malicious!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!It's wrong.Correction. It's going to cost you.In fact, I blame my last speeding ticket on this album.I am not convinced that Dancing with Kadafi was worth it.I am still listening to make myself positively sure.:-)"
2,Not terrible but definitely not great.,"Infected Mushroom has been around for a while, which is why I am so surprised that their music has yet to mature. Anyone who is familiar with the goa/psytrance scene must be aware that there are far far better producers than IM at this time. They may have been one of the pioneers of the genre, but they have since been eclipsed by better talent. If you don't believe me, feel free to email me and I will gladly send you (via mail or AOL IM link-up)one of my personal dj mixes which contain only non-commercial and underground producers (Son Kite, Noma, Timetech, Reefer Decree, etc.). I love the music and try to turn on as many people as possible. Email is djarchetype21@hotmail.com"
5,The perfect gift.,"For what you are paying this bracelet is beautiful. This was my first jewelry item I got from Amazon, and I was not disappointed. The Sapphire stones are dark and sometimes easily mistaken for black stones, but either way the metal is sturdy and I've had this bracelet for the last 2 years. If your looking for a beautiful gift for a loved one, but don't have much to spend this is a perfect gift."
2,My opinion on the San Marco bracelet,"The San Marco bracelet was very pretty and well made. However, I did return it because I thought the sapphire stones looked too black. In fact, the stones didn't look blue at all, even in bright sunlight."
3,Can really irritate gums,"It's been some time, but I used this product twice over the years when my crowns quit matching my natural teeth. I had used the Rembrandt bleaching gel from the dentist (with excellent results) and had the tray left over. I recommend not putting this product in a mouth tray. I did and it burned/irritated my front gum so badly it quickly receded from my tooth, affecting the look of the gumline. I also recommend not brushing more often than twice a day with this product. It does bleach well, but care needs to be taken."
5,Intimate Moments with the Savior - Learning to Love,"Wonderful, descriptive language that says what our hearts sometimes want to say, but can't find the words for. A useful tool to use for daily devotions. Also, good to share with a friend. Gire reaches out and touches our hearts!"
4,"Pulp Fiction, in literal terms...","""The Sharkskin Book"" is about a book of the same name, with a cover made of sharkskin, called ""The Way Out."" An indian by the name of Bull, has a brother named Mullarkey, and is hoping to clear another man of murder. That man has already admitted to the murder, but there are loose strands everywere, and this is just the first 30 pages!!! Readers of Harry Stephen Keeler are never surprised to hear this kind of plot layout, and from what I have heard, this one is one of his lesser novels. But this is a wild ride, and a fun mystery supense novel from the 1940's nevertheless. Keeler's books are hard to find, but your local library may be able to get them for you if you are interested. There is also a great site on the Web devoted to him called The Harry Stephen Keeler homepage.http://home.williampoundstone.net/Keeler/"
5,This toothpaste is great. It has a wonderful ...,"This toothpaste is great. It has a wonderful clean taste and it really cleans your teeth. It has tartar control, baking soda, and fluoride all in one. It isn't highly priced and is comparable to other brands. I'll be purchasing this toothpaste for my family. We love it."
2,The first time I brushed my teeth with ...,"The first time I brushed my teeth with Colgate with Baking Soda & Peroxide I didn't care for it - especially the taste. However, with each use, I changed my mind. I kept thinking of the benefits from the added baking soda and peroxide, which should help with fresh breath and whitening of the teeth. While it isn't my favorite toothpaste, I'd recommend it to my family and friends."
5,Will make you doubt current biblical scholarship,"Terrific book. Wenham clashes with modern theories about the bible, mostly by exploring early texts and studying verbal independence among the synoptic gospels. His arguments are impressive. In particular, he insists that the synoptics were all written before 70 AD. He points out, for example, that Luke tells us of the fullfilment of Agabus' prophecy of worldwide fame (Acts 11:28). Yet Luke fails to mention the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, which so clearly fullfilled Jesus' prophecy about the temple."
5,Great Book!,I love this book! It gives you a completely different approach to living well and eating better. I love the new/old ideas. We need to get back to paying attention to our bodies and stop stopping at the Golden Arches just because we drove by. Get back to working for our food. I love this approach to eating and using our own devices to listen to what our bodies are telling us. Great book!
3,I was happy with how clean and fresh ...,"I was happy with how clean and fresh my mouth felt after using this toothpaste. However, the taste isn't great. I didn't notice much of a change in the color of my teeth, but I've used it for only seven days. Perhaps with continued use, some whitening will occur. I prefer a gel toothpaste, so this seemed a little chalky to me. I will continue to use it to see if my teeth become whiter. If that happens then the poor taste and texture will be worth it."
5,I really like this toothpaste because it leaves ...,"I really like this toothpaste because it leaves an extremely fresh feeling and aftertaste in my mouth. I had a """"clean"""" feeling for a much longer period of time than with my usual toothpaste. The baking soda and peroxide can be actually be felt working while you brush. I would definitely buy this product again!"
4,Good results but watch out,"I bought it two weeks ago, I am using it once per day.My teeth are brighter and whiter, and seem cleaner.But since yesterday, I have felt more sensitive to cold food and water ...I think I'm gonna combine with another toothpaste for sensitive tooth."
3,"It's a great toothpaste to whiten your teeth, ...","It's a great toothpaste to whiten your teeth, but taste is not so good. It's really showing some whiteness on my teeth, though I've used it for only a week or so."
3,Colgate is one of my favorite toothpaste brands. ...,"Colgate is one of my favorite toothpaste brands. However, I think this time, they've mixed together too many different ingredients. I haven't used it long enough to give it an honest opinion. Perhaps the peroxide whitens your teeth over time, and the paste controls tartar. It just didn't leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean like other toothpastes that I've used."
5,George Jones,God's Country: George Jones & Friends CDThis is one of George's Best CD's. My husband and I are true George Jones Fans. The music is so BEAUTIFUL...
4,Wonderful,"My wife got this CD for me for Xmas. I listened to it a couple of times, not with my full attention, and thought it was OK. Then I got to hear them in concert. Wow! After that I took the time to listen and really pay attention. And loved it. The title gets it right - I've never heard such passionate playing before.Bottom line - if you're looking for some background music, this CD is just OK. But if you have the time to sit and listen, it's great!"
3,Skilled but safe,"This is a well-executed trio album, but I was hoping for more fire & passion. These are smooth & skilled interpretations, but not fiery or anguished as Piazzola ought to be. If you're looking for really impassioned Piazzola, try Gidon Kremer's ""Hommage á Piazzola.""Maybe in part it was the production values. The piano and cello ought to have more presence, more bite in this kind of music. Many cuts struck me as rather violin-focused.I liked the Villa-Lobos best. Perhaps because it's been over-recorded, over-exposed (on radio) and over-arranged, it's a pleasure to hear this relatively spare, clean cut."
4,Entertaining,I don't know much about classical music but I enjoyed this album. I downloaded it through Amazon's MP3 service. I had to install software to do so. It was still easily imported in iTunes.
1,Authentic Piazzolla it is not,"For those Piazzolla fans (a.k.a. those who delight in Piazzolla's band recordings), the lack of authentic tango sound, percussion, and rhythmic drive will keep you from listening for more than 2-3 seconds. Unfortunately, the Eroica Trio seems to think beautiful sound and smooth textures are suited to the style. Unfortunately, they are wrong."
3,Aladdin rocks the roofs out,"Mr.Elaasar has written a wonderful and splendid book. His effort to address the muslims is clear an adheres to many islamic beliefs. He an okay author who's debut novel is an instant classic. Mr. Elaasar has shown the skills he was gifted with, his book is also funny is many senses. Even the name ""Aladdin"" is funny and odd for an author. He play games in the book also."
5,Discovering a lost Composer,"Christian Cannabich: SymphoniesIt seems incredible that more and more wonderful music is discovered in Europe's libraries, conservatories, museums and being found to be very listenable in the 21st. Century. So we find this CD, a recording under Contemporaries of Mozart from Chandos, by one of the best musical groups around, the London Mozart Players under Matthias Bamert. Every piece is a genuine delight. And when you think about it, there MUST have been many other composers before Mozart, before Haydn, who people were in fact listening too at that time and we often find, looking back, may have been more famous than those composers we know today and most frequently hear, i.e. Mozart, Haydn. So yes indeed, this CD is worth a purchase, especially if you enjoy the music of either Haydn or Mozart. THREE premier recordings plus two others, some sixty six minutes plus of beautiful music!"
2,Not for a family that has adopted,"I realize this is a spin off the classic The Ugly Duckling but I would think in this day and age it would be played up to respect and recognize that not all family members look alike now. Interracial marriages/families and those families that adopt a child of a different race may want to avoid this book.The little airplane realizes he doesn't look like his truckling siblings as they peer at him and taunt him for not fitting in or looking like them. He ventures out and meets others asking if he is one of them and still doesn't fit in until he sees more airplanes. Then he feels he has met his family and where he belongs. This book could create confusion and feelings of not belonging to any child that does not look like his/her parents or siblings.That said, I loved the illustration in this book. Kudos for that but none for the author for not modernizing this story to recognize diversity."
3,cute version of the Ugly Duckling for vehicle lovers,"My 3 year-old loves cars and trucks. He enjoys this book even though he isn't familiar with Hans Christian Andersen's original version. A cute story. Not fine literature, but very cute."
4,Old but Classic,"Old movie, but still Classic...gives you info on St. Francis of Assisi. Inspirational on what he gave up and became for Christ."
2,OK not as inspiring as ...,... Brother Sun Sister Moon; perhaps a bit more historically accurate though.Worth the look.Not much more to say except the program is asking for more words.
2,Wooden Francis,"Earnest, yet so-so rendering bio reinactment, 'Francis of Assisi' doesn't give the troubadour saint the spark he deserves. The film is a product of its times, giving the movie a lot of ceremony, but not much substance. While actor Bradford Dillman musters enough passion at the end and in other, select scenes, he seems like a better fit for a fifties' TV series. The pomp and circumstance aims for the pre-Vatican II pew, and the subplot, a rivalry between Francis and Bernardo over Claire's love, is an accomodation for a general audience clueless about celebacy. Nevertheless, 'Francis...,' mostly accurate and reverent--despite its many flaws--invites a traditional audience."
4,Very Simple Like St. Francis of Asissi was!!!,"The actor who portrays St. Francis is very realistic, in that after watching it for a few minutes, one feels as if it is the real St. Francis of Asissi!!! Also the movie shows the audience the great relationship St. Francis shared with St. Claire, their mutal respect for each other and trust, moves one to tears!A great scene in the movie is when he visits the pope in rome, its funny; he basically walks up to the Vicar of Christ and says, ""I am starting a new order and I need your permission and Blessing."" Amazing!!!Anyone who loves St. Francis Of Asissi should watch this movie especially on his feast day which I believe is October 4th!Enjoy and be inspired!sincerely,amazon customer,maria lombardo"
3,Francis of Assisi,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was able to view it in Australia. Thanking you very much. Val Stafford.
3,Poor quality!,"This movie includes many details not shown on Brother Sun Sister Moon, but it's a shame the quality of the graphics and poor performance on the actors. Saint Francis was a great master and hopefully someday a truly inspired director will come forward and will create a True Masterpiece, that will include all the details so necessary to inspire a soul."
3,Francis of Assisi quite a boring spectacular,Watching the film was quite disappointing. With so many wonderful old actors I expected much more. Extremely disappointing was the fact they did not really let us know how he has become so connected with the annimal world we associate him with.The movie would be a dismal box office failure if made for todays sophisticated viewers.
3,Francis of Assisi,"The DVD had many flaws. What ever company made it, did a very poor job of recording the film."
5,It is a great movie about a great Saint.,"I am catholic, and I read a lot about Saint Fraincis of Assisi. This movie is the closest to the history. This movie is really great, it showed Saint Francis life in detail before and after his call. It showed his love of all God's creatures, and how he loved his enemies. He was called for peace and love, and he did all it takes to show his love to everyone. He did what he was preaching for. I recommend that movie to any catholic or non catholic. Saint Francis is a great."
5,Gripping Movie,"This is the movie based on Peter Maas' book - In a Child's Name. I viewed the movie after reading the book and what makes this movie exceptional is that it is one of the few movies which depicted an accurate version of the book. A few names were changed and the focus of the movie was on the victim's sister portrayed fabulously by Valerie Bertinelli. The movie is very effective in producing a lot of emotions in the viewer just as the book was. There is a lot to be learned from the movie - family love and support, the tragedy of domestic violence, communities pulling together for a good cause, the power of journalism in influencing court decisions, the judicial system ignoring what is in the best interests of a child, doing a thorough investigation of a person before jumping into marriage and finding out that they are a monster and finally - good does triumph over evil."
2,Read the book,"The Peter Maas book IN A CHILD'S NAME, a true-crime masterpiece, was not adapted well for this TV-movie version. I almost could understand why the filmmakers downplayed the sexual aspects of the story of wife-murderer Ken Taylor. But I don't understand why this TV-movie IN A CHILD'S NAME made the victim's sister the central character. You would think it would focus on the antagonist, but maybe they did not want to make a Charles Manson-style star of killer Taylor. If that's so, then the point of view of journalist Peter Maas, whose New York Times Magazine article prevented the murderer's parents from illegally adopting the victim's son, would have carried the film. Anyway, read the book!"
5,The Girls Next Door,"Loved the purchase, but the some of the DVD's don't work on one of my tv's.....i don't know why but no biggie! THANKS!!"
5,Nice and Uncensored,"Well to start of i love playboy. Im going to get to the basics. I bought mine at Target, and no matter where you buy this, its all the same, and Uncensored. Their is no blurs when their is nudity. Its all raw and great."
5,exactly what I was looking for,"This product is exactly what I was looking for. With deleted scenes and extra footage. The shipping only 2 days, it was great around Christmas time."
4,fun!,"If you've enjoyed watching The Girls Next Door on TV, you'll love this DVD set! Nothing is edited, so it's a little easier to watch (no beeping in your ear every 30 seconds).The DVDs could be improved a little with the ""play all"" function for deleted scenes and episodes. The bonus pictures (on the third DVD) are also fun."
4,dumb show with plenty of T&A,"The only reason that anyone would want to watch this show is the beautiful women, and the fact that the DVD's are uncensored makes it all the better.Otherwise, this show is pretty stupid. Most episodes focus on the girls trying to please Hefner in some way (planning a party or buying a gift). Uncensored the show is completely unwatchable as the girls are total dumb @sses. While many fans consider Kendra (who is also the hottest) to be the dumbest girl of the trio, but I still remember Holly Madison's embarrassing debut on the Howard Stern show. She came in and sang a song ""I want more radio, give me more Howard Stern"". So desperate to get 15 minutes of fame, she agreed to walk the streets of New York wearing a dunce cap with a tampon taped to her nose. The funny thing is that everyone seems to have forgot."
4,Girls Next Door 1st season DVD set,"I Love the Girls Next Door! I could not imagine Hef dating anyone else. My only wish for this DVD set is a see all episode option like they did with 2nd DVD set, other than that...Good Job Girls & Hef!"
5,A Band You Must Know...,"House of Fools. Learn to love 'em. I have not heard much about them until I saw Drive-Thru promoting them. Since I have been an avid fan of Drive-Thru, I was confident that they were worth checking out.Seriously, this EP is incredible. I especially love, ""Better Part of Me"". I don't know too many bands that I can actually listen to over and over again that embrace a 'chill' sound.....HOF is now definitely one of them. I highly suggest buying this EP!"
1,Very poor quality transfer....,"This version of the classics, The Killer and Hard Boiled, is one to avoid. Spend some extra cash and get the criterion version. This versoin has poor sound and image quality. Where are the extras?????"
1,not very good,"this movie is plain bad. yes good gun fight but where's the kung fu. Theirs plenty of american made film that are way better in terms of action sequence. Man even the gun fight in Face off was much better then the killer or hard boiled. Maybe im not into old fashion gun fight like in these two movie, i would rather watch a movie like ballistic kiss, great gun fight, some kungfu and a little special effect. I don't care if the killer or hard boil was made 10 or 20 years ago. It's just didn't live up to my potential. This is the 21st century, i need some special effect. I don't understand why some of you people keep living in the past. trust me their are way better mivie then these two and were made in the 70 and 80. Take for example the God Father 1 and 2, much better movie then these two, go and recomend this movie for the customer not some lame movie like killer and hard boil. As for chow yun fat check out my review for Hidden dragon crouching tiger."
4,How to play this on an iPod!,"You can. It'll take a little work, but a friend of mine figured it out this morning. It's basically a matter of disabling your CD autoplay, and then finding this little program on the CD itself and disabling that as well. I won't put details here in case that's not cool, but to get the details, just Google ""Velvet Revolver copy protection"", and you'll find the answer. (the Velvet Revolver CD had this same problem....)Oh yeah, the CD. Like it so far. :)"
3,"Fantastic Album, Disappointing CD","First and foremost this is an excellent album. It's a worthy evolution from Youth and Young Manhood. Songs like ""King of the Rodeo, Tapered Jean Girl, Pistol of Fire"" and ""Velvet Snow"" are some of the best new music I've heard. Aha Shake Heartbreak is a fine piece of music and one of few recent albums worth purchasing.BUT. This album is copy protected. Which means BMGs intent is to keep listeners from playing the CD on their computers or non-Windows media digital music player. I know there are ways to circumvent this inconvenience but on principle alone I urge everyone not to buy this album. If you want to support KOL (and it's worth it), buy a T-shirt and/or a concert ticket. But don't encourage the corporate money machine to limit your freedoms.Still, it is a wonderful CD."
1,"Go to hell, RCA - ""a unit of SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT""","This CD wouldn't even play. I listen to music via my computer, and even if I wanted to just LISTEN to the CD, I can't even do that. The music player program that comes with the CD wouldn't work on my computer. Who would want to buy a CD that you can't even listen to? What a rip-off. DO NOT BUY COPY-PROTECTED CD's."
4,Punk that Two Steps,"In order to like the Kings(or a least appreciate them) you should like a little bit of country and punk. After all, they are a country punk band, and a very tight one at that. They do have a Stokes groove to their sound, but that's where comparisons stop completely. They have been playing for years as a family and raised on southern gospel music. So the traditional stuff is there, but it's the punk influence that give the music its fire. King of the Rodeo is a great song."
3,Good,"This CD by Kings of Leon is ok, but not there best by no means. It's still a good cd though. There newest cd is a really good one though."
2,hyped.,Ever wondered what it would sound like if Randy Newman was the front man of a watered down version of The Strokes? Well apparently these guys did....
1,Copy Protected CD.,"Contains copy protection which can be restrictive (unless you know how to use google at all, then it's not restrictive at all b/c it's easy to thwart).Great album though."
2,Southern Rock? Hee Hee Hee,"When they grow up, maybe they'll be Shooter Jennings. I'm not gonna hold my breath tho'."
1,Copy protection,This CD is useless to me. Don't buy CDs with copy protection. This is the last product by Kings of Leon that I will purchase.
1,101% Pure Garbage,"Don't believe the hype about these guys; this CD is best fortarget practice while shooting skeet. The singer sounds like mypuppy when he got sick after ingesting Drano.I've read where this band is considered southern rock. Thesouth that I'm thinking of is Tierra Del Fuego, which is about as low as you can go. It's horribly embarrassing that theseclowns are supposed to open for U-2. Watch where fans are goingto bomb the stage with rotten fruit, in order to get this bunchoff and get on with the headliners. This recording would makegood torture material for Al-Queda prisoners."
1,Greed,"Would love to hear this cd...reviews make it sound like something I'd enjoy. But I've bought over 1000 CD's in my life, 500 albums and 600 45's and not a single time has the seller tried to dictate to me how I played the music."
3,"More of the same, but I like it","Kings of Leon have put out another fun little album with Aha Shake. Most of the songs are upbeat and fun, and that's the vibe the band does well in creating. There are even a few slower songs on the album that are solid as well. Overall, the album is a quick, fun listen. They never do take you to the next level, like they did in Trani, but I doubt they really intend to. Grab a beer and enjoy. For their next album though, they really need to shake things up, because another album like this won't cut it.Oh and for all those people complaining about the itunes thing, sounds like a bummer. My copy doesn't have that problem but I got mine through the magical free CD fairy."
4,No iPod problems for me,"I wanted to give a dissenting opinion to the reviewers saying that this CD is so copy protected that it can't be transferred to an MP3 Player.I bought this CD on Tuesday, imported it easily into iTunes on my computer and then transferred it to my iPod with absolutely no problems. The song files on my computer hard drive and on my iPod play perfectly.Can you play the actual CD through your computer using iTunes or Windows Media Player? NoCan you import the songs into your computer and transfer to your MP3 player (at least iPod)? Absolutely yes.Oh yeah. The cd is pretty good as well."
1,What A Disappointment!,"After their brilliant debut with 'Youth & Young Manhood', the Kings Of leon prove that all their good ideas went into the first album. Gone is the passion, the anger, the madness, the enchanting riffs & the intensity. By the voice you can tell it's the same band, but this follow-up is slow, dull, tuneless and devoid of creativity. 'Youth & Young Manhood' was unique. 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' could be anyone"
1,Absolutely a joke,"To think for an instant these banshees deserve any ""praise"" at all is a joke. To even think this is ""southern rock"" is not only an insult put pure propaganda. These posers are furthest from southern rock n roll and those who disagree are simply pathetic and need an immediate head examination. Being a resident of the southern states i am insulted by false claims of these hipsters, hopefully they'll make it to the new OC mixtape! good luck fellas!"
1,california,"not a kid - just didn't want to sign up.just saw them with Dylan. They were horrible - could hardly stand to listen to the - well I wouldn't call it music. terrible songs, worse voices, awful lighting, luckily couldn't understand the words anyway. nothing good about this ""band""."
1,Encrypted CD Can Ruin Your Computer,"So does anyone really listen to an actual CD anymore? I don't--I have my 800+ legally bought and paid for CDs in storage in my basement. I keep my music in a big library in Apple Lossless Format in iTunes (where I can export copies to AAC for use on my iPod, or just keep use the big files). Computer feeds the files via a digital optical cable to my stereo. Being able to ""shuffle"" 15,000 songs isn't just great--it's a human right.If Amazon had been more explicit (think flashing red warning lable right next to the BUY button) I would never have purchased this disk. It installs (buggy) driver-level software on your PC or Mac. Can you disable it? Only if you can use Google... but that isn't the point.The point is that Brittney Spears doesn't make you install nannyware software. Is she a cooler artist than Kings of Leon are? Yep. As of now, she really, really is."
5,Super Great Terrific,This album is awesome from the first song to the last. It is a complete work of art. These guys are super talented. Each time I listen to the album I hear something new and like it a little bit more. I have had it for over a year now and I'm still not tired of it.
5,The Classic,"Of all their albums, this is the most distinctive, the one that will most help you understand what all the fuss is about. I like all their albums, but this one sears you with creative vision. And there are times when each song is my favorite song of the album.There is a crucial link between this album and Credence Clearwater Revival -- each grabs hold of the roots of earthy American music. This album is what southern rock should have been.By the way, I saw them warm up for Bob Dylan in San Francisco when this album was released and I had never heard any of their music. Caleb said ""this is the biggest crowd we've ever played for."" Who knows how many people there knew these songs? But it didn't matter, it still grabbed us, all of us, hard."
1,BOICOT THIS DAMN ALBUM GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!111,IT MESSED UP MY COMPUTER!!!!! IT'S SAD THAT THESE KIDS LET THIS EVIL COMPANY DO THAT TO MUSIC LOVERS LIKE ME AND YOU. YOU CAN'T EVEN RIP THE CD TO THE COMPUTER.FORGET ABOUT THIS ALBUM. LET'S TEACH THIS STUPID CORRUPTS THAT THIS KIND OF STUFF JUST WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM BUYING THEIR MUSIC.
3,Kings Of Leon - 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' (RCA) 3 1/2 stars,"Review no.91.'Aha Shake...' is the band's second effort.Have heard the name before,but this was my first listen to them.They're decent southern rock,with a kick to it.Tracks that I thought stood out were ""Slow Night,So Long"",the boogie number ""Pistol Of Fire"",""Day Old Blues"" and ""Taper Jean Girl"".Line-up:Caleb Followill-guitar&vocals,Mathew Followill-guitar,Jared Followill-bass and Nathan Followill-drums.Apparently,all four of them are related.Brothers,I believe.Might appeal to fans of the Jayhawks,Peter Yorn,Black Crowes and Rhett Miller."
2,"Different, not better","I admire the others here who could compare this favorably with ""Youth and Young Manhood."" I'll admit that I find that album amazing and wanted more of the same. Change is something many bands don't really do until their third major release, or beyond, but KoL have definitely changed. The problem for me is, it sounds more like change than the rock and roll on Youth. There are three or four rockers here and a lot of atmospheric wanderings, but that ain't gonna do it for me. The attempts at ballads, like Milk, are weak. I guess I'll add the three or four winners here to a best of with Youth and Young Manhood, because I won't be putting this one in the player"
1,Dont support copy protected music,"I bought this CD because I liked the song ""The Bucket"". I will not even comment on the music in this review, because I could never get it onto my mp3 player. Why, when I pay for a CD, should I not be able to use it for my own purposes freely? I would strongly urge nobody to purchase copy protected music, I certainly never will again. It is insulting, annoying, frustrating, and stupid since neither the Kings of Leon or RCA will ever get my buisness again. Send a message to them that you wont either and they'll stop trying to rip us off."
2,Bad Packaging,"I received my package and was surprised to find out that the CD case had been cracked in three different places on the back side...This leaves me extremely disappointed, but I hope the CD is fine."
1,Beware IPOD users,I bought this yesterday. I listened to one cut when I got home and decided to put it on my IPOD - standard .wav format.You can't. The copy protection is such you cannot import this. When I emailed the company - their support said they were trying to work out the details with Apple - but Apple is proprietary. Hmm. .wav is a standard format. Your encyption is proprietary. I returned the CD. Told the clerk at the store why. Good luck if you have an IPOD. They have a workaround - but you have to burn another CD. It's not worth my time. This CD is not worth it. Corporate Greed.
1,Useless if you own an Ipod,"Run away from this CD. Not sure if all copies are this way, but the one I picked up at Best Buy tonight has Sunncomm copy protection. The disclaimer after you accept their license agreement is too bad, so sad if you want to rip to your Ipod. I went out of my way to pick it up for a long weekend drive. Loved Kings of Leon, really looking forward to this new Cd, wanted to see them in concert, but won't waste my time on them anymore. Life is too short. There is plenty of good music out there that doesn't carry infuriating Sunncomm copy protection."
5,Great Raw Sound and Musicianship,"Aha Shake Heartbreak is an excellent album best listened to all the way through. Each song tells a store (southern gothic) that allows the listener to imagine what is was like growing up in the deep south. There are no weaknesses on this album. While different from their first, Youth and Young Manhood, it is not necessarily better. But plays at a slightly different pace. Innovations abound. Check out Milk (must be listened to 4-5 times to appreciate), Razz, Velvet Snow. Best cuts, Slow Nights So Long, Four Kicks, Day Old Blues, Pistol of Fire. This band has a long future ahead."
4,Good But Security Code Is A Drag,"I enjoyed the album but couldn't play it on my iPod due to the ""anti-theft"" security restriction embedded in it. I returned it to Tower Records and bought something else that would play. Sorry guys. If you re-release the album without the security restriction I'll buy it again."
4,better than first,"The new album by the kings of leon is better than their acclaimed debut, because it flows better as a whole album. The vocals sound exactly the same, but the music is more of a stop and start sound. I like King of the Rodeo and really the whole album needs to be listened to. It takes more than one listen to really appreciate. The Strokes comparisons are justified in some ways, but the Kings of Leon are by far a superior band in my opinion. The lead singer's voice can be annoying but once you get use to it, you start to like it. This is a great album!"
4,BEWARE OF COPY PROTECTION,"I like this CD a lot, but returned it because the copy protection does not allow you to make a copy for personal use. I always burn a copy to listen to in my car but the copy protection does not allow you to do this."
1,UNACCEPTABLE,"I paid good money for this CD only to find it wont work on an ipod due to copy protection.I assume this is to encourage me to steal an unencrypted copy online??? Could there be any other reason? I have 3000+ CDS--this is my first with this crudware installed(The music gets 5 stars, but I'll rarely hear it if I can't MP3 it).Amazon needs to IMMEDIATELY mark these CDs--""Incompatible with ipod""."
5,Good Southern Rock,"This is a good cd. The swearing is a little ridiculous, but the lyrics and the music are good. I really like it alot. I have to listen to their first album. Favorites include Slow Night, So Long, King Of The Rodeo, Pistol Of Fire, The Bucket, Razz, Four Kicks, and Rememo. Highly recommended."
2,Who Put The Band On Downers?,"Having recently purchased and fallen in love with Youth & Young Manhood, I rushed right out and bought Aha Shake Heartbreak (after reading many of the reviews here). I have to say I'm disappointed. Aha Shake Heartbreak has little of the fast-paced rock I loved from Youth & Young Manhood. It's almost like they ran out of energy. I hope they get some rest and come back with another kickin' CD."
1,Garbage.,"I bought this album after hearing nothing but good news and reviews about them. Turning on the tracks, they start to rock with great raw guitar and good drums. It all goes down from there when the singer, if you would like to call him that, throws his voice into the mix. Pure garbage. I want my money back."
1,3 Bottles Of Nyquil And You (U2) Might Actually Enjoy Them!,I drank two bottles of Nyquil and I still don't get it! I saw a band in a bar last night that smokes Kings of Leon and The Strokes and they were only playing for the door! It's quite a common occurence here in the South. Kings Of Leon on RCA AND opening for U2?! 2 bands pulling the wool over the eyes of the world! Jesus Wept.
1,Wow......,"True or false... this band is opening for the greatest band in the world (U2)..... unfortunately.... very true... how this has happened truly confuses me. even though there are bands like coldplay or snow patrol or muse to open, for some horrible reason someone out there listened to this band and said, these guys make good music. stay far away and wait for a band who will sing and actually play their instruments"
2,kentucky fried strokes?,"The only reason they got the second star from me is because of their first album. Their first album ""Youth and Youngmanhood"" was absolutly astonishing. The re-birth of southern rock even. This, this, sounds like all the other crap you damn kids are listening to theese days-(that is a minus sign)a year or two. And for all y'all who don't like it, espodeeza.(that is a period)"
1,god-awful racket,"Just saw these guys open for U2 in Philadelphia. The gal I was with just turned to me, laughed, and asked if they were serious. Absolutely torturous noise. The singer could not even find the correct keys for the songs he was ""singing"". The lyrics were just as terrible as the performers. If this is the future of music, it is a very bleak one indeed. The band was as lame as the singer. They rest of the band couldn't find an original melodic idea if they tried. Advice to anyone going to future U2 shows - skip the opener! Zero stars would be more applicable for this nonsense."
1,Horrible,"I ordered this product over a month ago, it took the company a month to let me know what I had ordered was out of stock then another two weeks for it to get to me.I love this cd, these guys are so talented! The disk was worth the weight!"
1,"""Heartbreak"" is right!","Kings Of who???? I have not heard of this band until rumor had it they were touring with U2. Shortly after, I caught ""The Bucket"" on the radio and thought that it was worthwhile to pick up the album. Aha! Where do these great review from the likes of Rolling Stone come from??? I wasnt only disapointed with the album, I have given serious thought of selling the album back. I love all kinds of music, especially alt rock. But this is beyond anything I've heard. Not worth it."
3,ok,"lighter weight material than other duffels and more fragile than i expected, and the measurements were not clear before purchase, but it survived the trip"
1,Buy another book...,"There are plenty of precious metal clay books worth buying but this is not one of them--unfortunately. This was the first precious metal clay book I bought and now that I completed the 3-day certification class in PMC, I realize how poorly done this book is, and I wasted my money on this publication. The instructions are marginal. The layout is very confusing and poorly done. It appears the book was put together by someone who has no knowledge or experience in desktop publishing or technical writing. The photos are not clear and are poor quality, and the ""busy"" backgrounds make it hard to see the object in photo-- some of the photos should have just been left out since they don't enhance or help to clarify the directions. Instead, I would recommend the metal clay books by Cece Wire, Sheri Haab or Tim McCreight. Those books are definitely worth having."
1,Overpriced duplicate of other publications,"This is not a book, more of a pamphlet. The information & projects provided are all from other publications by the author, and offers nothing for even the most basic of beginners. Avoid this ""book"" and save your money for some PMC+."
1,What a RIPOFF,"I was beyond disappointed with this ""book"". First off I expected to receive a book and not a pamphlet. Second the information was useless if you have ever read any other PMC book. I will definitely make a note of the author and never buy sight unseen from her again. There are so many good books out there to choose from. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Not great.,"A concise history indeed! Craven does admit that this book contributes little to the study of Indian art and that it only mentions the most studied works. This text was purchased for an art history course and I would have to say that while it gets the job done, it is not a stand out text by any means.I am not a proof-reader or a literary critic but I found the writing to be ""clunky"". While reading I got the impression that the author wrote this book from notes or dictations.This book does not do the art of India justice. The text detracted from what I am sure is a fascinating subject. All-in-all, not great."
3,Review of Craven's 'Indian Art',"Craven presents a fairly shallow looks at the culture of Indian art, presenting the various developments in style an technique from a boxy Western perspective. Craven notes in a few places how the art of India has no share in the aesthetic interests of, say, Europe, but in other places he seems very keen on feeding historical developments through this rubric."
1,info not complete,"all batteries are sold with mAh ratings .... this one says ""replace"" .... how is one to know what the actual product is ...... batteries are sold in wide range of mAh levels, and it is silly to buy something without knowing ......... why the deception ?"
1,Ugh!,"This is not a book for beginners! It's like the author vomited all the information he knew then paid no attention to putting it in context. Buddhism has lovely stories behind it but this book doesn't present the information in any kind of interesting way. I might look back on it as a resource once I learn more, but it is not a good introductory book."
4,good just the turtles lacking personalities bring it down one star!!!!!!!!,first of all this show is great but the turtles lack DIFFERENT personalities because they're supposed to fight brothers all fight they don't agree on much of anything!!!!!!!!
2,THE TURTLES ARE GREAT BUT THIS DVD IS NOT,"GROWING UP, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE TURTLES BUT THIS DVD STINKS. THE ONLY PLUS IS THAT I CAN HAVE THE ORIGINAL EPISODES IN CONVENIENT DVD FORM RATHER THAN TRACK DOWN A BUNCH OF OLD VHS TAPES. THIS DVD IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SEASON ONE AND SEASON THREE DVD'S. THEY ALL HAVE SPELLING ERRORS AND TITLE ERRORS AND EACH ONE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCE IN A HALF-A$$ FASHION JUST TO CAPITALIZE ON THE NEW TURTLE'S SUCESS. WHICH BY THE WAY THE NEW TURTLES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES. ON THE SEASON THREE DVD THE PACKAGE REFERS TO ""BEBOP"" AS BEBOB, NICE EDITING JOB. I GUESS IT WAS TO HARD TO GET THAT ONE RIGHT. ALSO ALL THREE OF THE DVD'S ARE BARE BONES WITH NO SPECIAL FEATURES. THE PRICE DOES HOWEVER REFLECT THE CRAPPY JOB THE STUDIO DID ON THIS MOST OF THESE DVD'S CAN BE PURCHASED FOR AROUND 10 BUCKS. I JUST WISH THAT PETER LAIRD HAD THE RIGHTS TO THE OLD SHOW SO THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE SOME JUSTICE ON DVD."
5,Just Buy It!!,13 episodes on one DVD equals over 3 hours of uninterrupted fun. The quality is fine and all that blah blah blah. No extras yes but who cares!? I want the vintage episodes (which is exactly what is here!!) and not a bunch of cheesy extras taking up space that may have cost us a few precious chapters. If you are a fan and have been waiting for this release - just buy it!! You'll love it!!And bring on Season 3!
4,TMNT Power,I loved this show as a kid and decided to see if my 4 year old son would too. It didn't take him long and he was asking me the turtles names and getting into the show. It's a classic cartoon and offers a cheap form of entertainment at less than $10 per season.
5,God old times,"I ordered the first three volumes for Chirstmas for my husband. We grew up with this show and we enjoy watching the old cartoons, since we dont have cable. Well, I recieved way before it said I would and the product was in great shape. Not one mark on the plastic wrapping or anything. I'm going to order from the place for as long as I can. It's hard to find a shipper that takes care of the product and the customer. :)"
5,Excellent Quality!,"This crocodile is very well made. We're using it for our Vacation Bible School themed ""Crocodile Dock"" which takes place in the bayoo. It will be perfect!"
2,descent,"Purchased this item for my daughter to put her housekeys on. Wanted something she would like so she would be more likely to take care of it. When it was received it was put together a little backward, meaning that it would not straighten out with the decorative side showing. The key clasp was also broken so I had to get my own to fix it."
1,Sequin Lanyard - disappointing,"Received black color which is not appealing to look at. Although price is very economical, I would not order again if not given an option to select color. The other colors looked nice, too bad that's not what they sent."
2,poor quality,I got the two most bland colors available (black&gold). They don't have sequins on both sides of the lanyard so they look tacky. And you can see glue under the sequins which is not appealing to me. Will not be ordering again.
2,great while it lasted which was 3 days:(,"Product only lasted me 3 days before it started 2 fall apart where the velceo meets the band.Then a couple days later little blk pieces of material started coming off.And its not like i was doing anything crazy w/it only treadmill and set-ups. I will say this if ur still set on buying it this is another thing to think of.Im tall and have a tall upper body and this waist trimmer went all the way up to underneath my breast which i thought was great @ 1st but relized very soon that while i was doing any sort of exercise i felt very constricted in the upper chest.I kept trying to move it down but no luck would creep back up.So i guess what im trying to say is if ur under 5 9"" it wont fit u."
1,dont buy,this product is not good it started to fall apart after 3 uses and the velcro was coming apart from the actual neoprene
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this waist trimmer to work out in while I was doing my P90X. It only lasted for a month. I wore it for just over an hour five times per week while working out, it really makes you sweat so it was great. After my workout was over I promptly took it off and hand washed it in my bathroom sink with a little shampoo or just a rinse, and hung it over my shower curtain rod to dry. I noticed after a few weeks that the material began to separate from the neoprene in the area where the velcro attaches after you wrap it around your waist. Maybe the velcro is too strong for the lightweight belt? Then the neoprene just tore after that and it went into the garbage."
3,Waist trimmer,"I bought this with the intent to trim the old handles and shrink the gutt a bit for summer. I have used it for two weeks now and I have lost 1.5 inches off the waist line. That is a good thing.However, I wash this everyday. I sweat in this thing, it stinks, you would be crazy not to wash after every use. The first couple of times I just washed it in the sink and let it air dry. No worries!The other day I tossed it in the washer and to my horror, it is starting to come apart. The velcro is starting to wear away and the top and bottom of the edges of the belt are doing to same. The product does say it is machine washable so I'm not sure what exactly happened with this one.I was expecting a little more use out of the belt. Two weeks seems quite sudden for the belt to be wearing away to where it is no longer usable."
2,Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer,"I have purchased these belts in stores and have been very pleased with them. So I decided to purchase online. The cost was less than in the store and shipping was free. I purchased about 8 of these for myself and for a few of my girlfriends in my exercise class. I wore one right out of the box and the fabric separated from the neoprene (rubber part)when I removed the belt after class. One of my girlfriends told me that the same thing happened to her with one of the new ones I gave her. So, 2 out of 8 so far not happy with. We only wore one time and had to throw away. They felt the same quality as the ones purchased in the store. Not sure what happened to the 2 that tore?? And the others are fine and have even been washed, in a front load washer, air dried. Still very pleased with this product and would consider purchasing again. All in all good product for the price."
5,Great Back Support,This belt is a great back support. Wore it on a two week vacation to Europe and did not have any back pain. Recommend it highly.
1,Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer,"I walk on a treadmill every morning for an hour wearing a waist trimmer. After several years, my old waist trimmer wore out so I purchased a new Valeo Waist Trimmer. By the fifth day it started coming apart. The material covering the neoprene separated from the neoprene. Within a few days later I had to discontinue using it. I purchased a new waist trimmer of a different brand from Wal-Mart and though it was cheaper it works much better."
2,Don't bother!,Doesn't stay in the right place. I'd rather pull my own stomach in to strengthen my back.
3,inexpensive but you get what you paid for,"I bought one made by LP which costed about $10 (but no free shipping). This one costs $7 (free shipping). LP has fabric on both sides and edges are stitched. This one has fabric on only one side and no edge stitching. Feels like an oversized mouse pad to some extent. I'm sure both can achieve the same results, but I think that fabric on the inside would definitely feel better than wearing exposed rubber."
3,Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer,"I do not recommend Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer.It has it's good points though it makes a nice tummy tucker worn under a shirt it's narrow enough not to be seen.But for a workout I did not care for it,When exercising belt curls up and curls down."
1,"Poorly constructed, unreliable, and not worth it!","Last spring I bought Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer and had problems with it. The materials were cheap and the neoprene ended up fraying very quickly. The velcro ended up ripping off. Stay away from the Valeo! It seems like the quality has gone down since it was first introduced to Amazon in 2005I bought the McDavid Waist Trimmer (Item model number: 491R)over a month ago and love it! I am impressed with the quality of the materials and the velcro. The McDavid fits very well. It offers the support I was looking for and neoprene for heat retention. Unlike the Valeo, I have not had any problems with the velcro or fraying of the neoprene material.Spend the extra money and buy the McDavid!"
2,Flimsy Waist Slimmer/ Back Support,"This is the 3rd time I've purchased this Waist slimmer.The First time. It had a nice thickness and lasted through normal wear and tear. the 2nd time it was flimsy and only lasted maybe a month. the 3rd time I bought this slimmer, it was very flimsy & and ripped after the 2nd time i wore it. I purchased one from Bally's total fitness. It is cheaper and more sturdy. I don't recommend that you buy this one, unless you're tiny, and can wrap it around you twice."
1,"Oh, Oh torn already????","I was excited about getting this waist trimmer. I have used several others over the years and the reviews looked great. I receive the trimmer pretty quickly but after only three (mon,tues, wed) uses the whole top part is torn completely off. Not sure what happend :-0(I did notice it was much thinner than other waist belts I have worn before. Anyway wonder if this has happend before?TR"
1,Worst Waist Trimmer,"I am very dissapointed with this product. After three workout sessions, it looks like I had it for years and on top of that it's pretty small compared to other brands. I will never buy this product ever gain."
1,waist band a waste of money,not happy with product..rubber backing has already seperated from cloth front where velcro tab secures the band when it is wrapped around your waist.
3,worked great for a while,was good while it lasted!definitely helped in sweating and slimming down the waistline when i worked outi recommend
2,Definitely makes you sweat in your waistline.... but...,"It definitely makes you sweat in your waistline, but does not give immediate results. You have to incorporate toning exercises if you want a smaller, sleek waistline; Overall, I'll keep using it until I see noticeable results."
3,sweaty!,"Well, after wearing this overnight to help reduce water in the lower abdomen region, it definitely makes your stomach sweaty, so it seems to be working. have not taken the time to do measurements of the stomach, so i do not know how the results are."
3,Lost its shape within a day,"I bought this product reading the good reviews. I am not satisfied with the way it has worked for me. The belt lost its shape very quickly and I don't really feel a lot of support / pressure or anything using it. Maybe I am using it wrong.. But I must say, I didn't think it will lose its shape so quick."
1,Not good as i was expecting,"This product was not good for skin, sorry about that but i had to pass lot of skin problems"
2,"Works up a sweat, but doesn't work.","I bought this thinking that it could help me lose a bit of belly fat. I thought it would be a miracle product. I wore it every workout, and the neoprene got very wet with sweat, dripping, even, but saw no weight loss or change in my stomach. Not a good prduct at all."
2,It works only when you are doing any work outs,"This will work only if you are doing work outs, while you are not doing work outs if you wear this, I don't think it would be of any help."
5,Excellent,"I usually prefer the ones with the zipper but this is the best one with velcro. I use in the sauna, for runs, and over night at sleep. People have different methods whether they use plain with preparation H, baby oil, nothing or regular lotion. I like preparation H it helps with any inflame areas and shrinks tissues plus helps sweat great."
4,durable,"This is a nice durable product for a great price We bought it for our son with autism, who wanted more compression around his midsection. If it can stand up to him, it will stand up to you."
1,Dont buy this one,I have had this belt for 2 weeks and it ripped and the velcrow is comming apart if you are a gym rat don't buy this belt go with a heavier duty one this one is week and will fall apart if you are a weight lifter
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I just had a baby and was looking for something to help flatten my belly. I wear it a few times a week and I can already see a change after 3 weeks!!! It's not a miracle product, but it does make you sweat. It also helps a bit with my posture."
1,bad experience,"I've bought it, washed it lightly and it fell apart! I didn't even have the chance to use it, at least once! The cover came off the neoprene part and now it's simply useless. I have two other similar products from a different company and I've washed them over and over again and they're still ok, unlike this one. Besides, it's pretty narrow compared to all the other products I've used, it looks almost like a expanded belt. Don't buy it, it's probably the cheapest of its kind you'll ever come across!"
4,Great product,"I didn't necessarily believe that this product would work, but then I used it. I'm not a large person to begin with, but I was still impressed with this product. When I used it, I could really feel my waist area getting hotter. When I took it off, it was pretty sweaty. I've lost 4 pounds, and I'm back down to a 32"" waist, which means that most of that weight came from my waist. Quite impressed! However, I would not recommend using this product if you have lower back issues, since my lower back seemed to tense up a little bit, and I don't even have back issues. But it is not bad enough for me to stop using this product."
1,It broke straight away,"The material tore away from the rubber on day 2. Not a great product at all, the quality is very poor."
2,No firmness,"If you are over weight the trimmer rolls down to your hips,if they had rib supports or suspender straps they would work better. It does make you sweat on your waist though."
2,Fell apart very qickly,"Cheap, but didn't last. After using a couple of times, they started tearing up. They don't stretch well and tear easily."
4,"Good way to lose water weight, but drinks lots and HYDRATE!!","Yes, this product does what it says...which is make your middle literally pour out water. The belt looked positively GROSS after a hard dance class (which I thought was WONDERFUL!) However, the next day I felt weak and lightheaded, only to discover that my blood pressure was dangerously low (87/65)due to dehydration!!! I do drinks lots of water, but no where near enough to rehydrate after the fluid loss this belt causes. After this, I will be certain to drink plenty of G2 and water before, during, and after my workout. Be forewarned!!!!!!"
1,Not good,I bought it not too long ago and after 2 uses it ripped?? Please dont buy it..waste of money...
2,Valeo Neoprene Waist Trimmer,Was not enough detail about this waist trimmer. I used it on the bare skin and had difficulty in pulling and keeping the ends on top so the velcro will line up evenly on top or the lower portion of the waist trimmer to prevent it from pinching the skin. If it had something to hold on to for pulling evenly that would make it a better product. If you plan on using it over the shirt it would be more pleasant to use.
2,Fell appart,Unfortunately the saying you get what you pay for applies here. The black cloth came unglued from the belt so after less than 10 uses it was useless.
2,Works but after using for a week falling apart,"I want to start by saying I am not a large person to begin with but after a year of working out to get and stay in shape I thought a waist trimmer would help give the extra push I need to trim up my waist. First, it does sweat your waist and it is not uncomfortable at all. I purchased one for myself and my daughter. After using it for the last week (everyday but only a week), today it started tearing up completely. I am guessing if I am able to use it again tomorrow, that will be the end. The velcro fits really tight and it has pulled it totally apart. I would suggest purchasing a different waist trimmer and brand."
1,YHE WORST OF ALL,"IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL"
3,Doesn't Work For Long,"At first it was a good product for me. But after some time it started to rip apart. But it did help me with a back problem. Also, it was not delivered to my house, i had to drive after it."
3,This kit comes with both whitening toothpaste and ...,"This kit comes with both whitening toothpaste and special bleaching formula. After using as instructed for more than one week, I can safely say that my mouth feels clean and refreshed. As a toothpaste, it did very well. However, I haven't noticed any brightening. It may take longer than a week, so this may be premature -- we'll have to wait and see."
5,Toothpaste,"Umm yeah - I did buy toothpaste on Amazon.com. Got sick and tired of paying for a membership for the pleasure of buying goods at a store, only to have to stand in line to exit the place so someone could check my receipt to ""ensure I received what I bought"", and I only typically bought a few items in bulk so I wouldn't have to go so much. So, one Saturday I walked into a local Wal-Mart, looked around and asked myself, ""Why am I putting myself through this nonsense"". So, I turned around, went home, fired up my computer and voila - order razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste for several months. No big stores with 35 checkout lanes and 2 clerks working, no waiting behind 6 dozen angry customers, no road rage, no gas, no hassle. I told my 70+ year old neighbor what I bought and they thought it was fantastic. I'm never paying for a membership to shop or standing in line again!"
3,too many filters,"this unit worked well when I first got it, but now 6 months later the motor has become very noisy. also, I have to change the filter very often - I think they only last ~1-2 months. I would recommend a more powerful purifier unless you are going to use it in a very small room."
3,Not the same old dictinary I used in College!,"In college (I was a French major) I used an excellent paperback English-French, French-English dictionary put out by Random House. I have tried to find a recent version and thought this would be it. Not So! It has way fewer entries and the phonetic key seems different, not as clear to understand."
3,If only for the Sexy M.F. remix,I don't normally believe in remixes (I think it was hearing Mariah Carey talk about the maxi-single for Fantasy that put me over the edge) but the remix of Sexy M.F. on this disc is so solid that I wasn't disappointed with having five throw-away versions of the main song.
4,SKB pro tenor case,"I've purchased several SKB cases for my tenors. They are all sturdy, well designed, and give the unadervtised benefit of holding older tenors with the bell keys on the opposite side, at least the lower priced models do. This case holds my Mark VI Selmer, I haven't tried to put my old Conn 10M in it yet. I bought this one because of the extra storage space, which eliminates the need to put the neck and mouthpiece in the bell. It allows my mouthpiece to dry out faster and hopefully will prevent my Fibracell reeds from delaminating, which they have been doing by staying wet in a mouthpiece pouch. So far, it seems to be working. It's also nice to have a small pouch outside for carrying extra reeds. I'm quite satisfied with the case."
4,It ever so slightly piques the gamer in me,"My friend and I recently finished playing Halo Co-Op for the X-Box and the game reminded me of this book. For instance the varg are EXACTLY like the flood, and have the EXACT same 3 forms. Also the blue skinned beings whos name escapes me at the moment are like the Elites. Those guys who created the Starhammer are the Forerunner. The Starhammer is like halo and so on and so forth. Anyone who wants to know what the hell I'm babbling about should read this book and play Halo all the way through, and maybe read The fall of reach."
5,Praise for Starhammer,"Starhammer presents a new frontier for the sci-fi epic, or beautifully restores one. You be the judge.Having read the book four times, I never tire of what it has to offer.The human race is under the control of an alien race, the laowon. These are the darkest times in human history, and there is not hope in sight. Until Jon Iehard, the main character, comes across a mission he cannot decline. He is on a hunt for a terrorist the laowon badly. Who has with him half the key to a terrible secret which will set free the human race.To say more than this is to rob you of the pleasure of reading this book for yourself.Starhammer is a grand epic of unimaginable proportions. This is a must read for any sci-fi fan."
5,Great book all around!,"This whole series is completely suspenseful, and this book definately sets the stage!I found this book as I was looking for more information on the Halo backstory. Everything I was reading was saying that the developers borrowed pretty heavily from this series and they were definately right. Don't get me wrong, they are NOT the same story. There are just a lot of similarities, which in my mind is a good thing.A word of warning, though... Don't read this book unless you have a whole day to spend; once you pick it up, it's got you!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A series of three novels, all fairly ordinary. This is the story of some of Lando Calrissian's adventures before the events in Star Wars. Here, he has a lot of success in card games. He wins the Millenium Falcon, and then he wins a droid. A lot of hijinks for a smooth talking gambler and adventuruer."
3,not bad,"pretty good reading, gives you a better feel for lando, its slightly above my reading level im afraid so some of it is hard to comprehend. not a bad read tho."
2,Lando's Book,"Lando Calrissian finely gets a book! Classic Star Wars:The Lando Calrissian Adventures are three short novels published 16 years ago.Written by L. Neal Smith,a well-known Science Fiction author."
3,Die hard SW fans only,Its OK but will never be like any of Zahns novels. It does though provide a better look at Lando Calrissian. One thing to note though is that the author abviously doesn't know much about the SW universe in general. Still an OK book.
2,Boring. Very boring.,"If you like Star Wars books, great! This book still may not be for you! I read the first novel of the trilogy and quit after that. It just didn't seem to spark the same interest that the better Star Wars books have. Some of the elements didn't seem to belong in the Star Wars universe. All these combined with the fact that they chose the worst possible character to base a series on makes a bad book, not to mention a bad trilogy"
1,this book was very boring and hard to get into.,"I'm sure L Neil Smith is a perfectly good author, but his style is totally wrong for Star Wars."
1,Did the Author forget this is another Galaxy?,"I did not like these books. I have to admit that the 3rd book was the best of the three. But the first two are two of the worst books I have ever read. There are way too many references to cigarettes, sardines, children's TV icons, Rabbits from Breakfast cereals, and many other things from our galaxy and not the Star Wars galaxy. I know that this was one of the first Star Wars books ever written, but these books do not even fit in with the original trilogy, much less the Expanded Universe. If you want to read these books I would recommend forgetting everything you read in them, as soon as you are finished, especially if you are going to read any of the other Star Wars books. I have read several of the Star Wars books and these three are the worst by far."
1,BORING AND FULL OF PLAGIARISM,"I read these immediately after finishing James H. Schmitz' _The Witches of Karres_ when I was a high school student around 1985 or so. I remember thinking I had just read the names of a list of items in the cargo hold in the last book I had just read--sure enough, L. Neil Smith plagiarized straight from _The Witches of Karres_.While the plagiarism rankled a bit, I continued to work my way through them. The books are the most boring and ill-conceived I've read. Save yourself the time and read Eddings, Lackey, Moon, or McCaffrey--or even Schmitz' _The Witches of Karres_. All write much better than this plagiarizer."
4,Very Good,"These stories were a refreshing change from the more ""heavy"" star wars books, and makes for a nice break from the endless arrays of ""Greatest Threats Ever"" or giant Superweapons that plagued the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Corellian and Darksaber books. The Calrissian trilogy also has more in common with traditional sci fi than most Star Wars stories. The characterizations of Lando and his robot sidekick, Vuffi Raa, are spot on, even if the main villain, Rokur Gepta is totally generic. The story is pretty light throughout, it is always interesting and full of unexpected twists and turns. The droid, Vuffi Raa, is a classic robot, and has the same appeal as C3-PO and R2-D2. And if many of the details in the book seem wrong, or undefined, just remember that it was written in 1982-1983 when only two films and maybe five books of Star Wars were around. This series is far better than the 1978 Han Solo Adventures. Highly recommended."
2,underwhelming,"I've always felt Lando Calrissian never got enough attention in the Star War Expanded Universe. I read this book a while ago and just picked it up to reread it. While not all Star Wars books meet my expectations as an adult, I've found a fair amount of them do. Of the bad ones, this one was one of the worst. Lando is utterly unrecognizable as the debonaire man we knew from Empire Strikes Back. He just wanders around on silly adventures that failed to keep my interest. The side characters are even worse, from a ""sorcerer"" as the main villain to a starfish droid sidekick. Sorcerers, really?The one saving grace is that these books introduced Sabaac, the poker of the Star Wars EU. Seeing Lando play the card table was worth a reread. Lando is a natural as a con artist, not as an adventurer That's why I gave the book 2 stars instead of just 1. If for nothing else, we can thank the Lando Adventures and L. Neil Smith for that."
3,Some Redeeming Qualities,"As a big Star Wars fan, I found that I both loved and hated this book. I realise it was written in the 1980's, and before the EU was out at that. Mindharp Of Sharu was really hard to get through. I winced at the corny writing, the thin plot, and what today are considered anachronisms in the Star Wars universe. I really groaned when the author threw in the Trix rabbit at a random inapropriate time in Flamewind. What really worked well for this book was the subplots. The concept of the Centrality, Vuffi Raa, the Oswaft, and especially the strange subplot of the Renatasian System made the series redeemable. I would love to see further EU stories expand on these things in future books. I also liked that it was a refreshing look at the Star Wars universe that showed that it got on without the Jedi or Sith involved in absolutely everything."
4,It is a good insight on Lando Calrissian,"I think that this book gives you a better feeling as to why Lando Calrissian is the way he is. Reading this book, was no different then reading the otehr Star Wars book. The exception was that Lando was the main character. If you want to read more about what Lando did before he met with Han Solo, read these books."
3,"Not the best, but interesting for historic value.","These were some of the original licensed Star Wars books, and were published shortly after Empire Strikes Back was released. Because of this, they have a significantly different view of Lando than has been built through ROTJ and the new novels. This would be forgivable if they were good books otherwise but, unfortunately, they aren't. The plots are mostly hokey, and a lot of the time they seem like bad imitations of Brian Daley's Han Solo trilogy. The exception is the final book, The Starcave of Thonboka. It stands head and shoulders above the other two, and it's almost worth wading through them to get to it. Oh, and they DO have some good Maverick-style Sabacc scenes, showcasing Lando's main skill. They're moderately interesting, but if you haven't read some of the other SW books yet, look elsewhere first"
4,Hello what do we have here,"I ordered this book without knowing whatsoever to expect. First and foremost the author describes Lando Calrissian with great detail. You get a wide eyed glimpse into the card player, scoundrel with a flair for the finer things in the galaxy. The author explains how Lando comes across the Millineum Falcon. A great deal of effort is spent into describing the other characters of this nuanced novel. There are three books in one. Without giving to much info, please keep in mind that this book came out in the early eighties! So the ""Star Wars Terminology"" is not abundantly present here. If you are looking for some good old fashion adventure with the most suave man the galaxy has ever produced, then i implore you to give this book a try. I gurantee you will be pleasantly surprised."
4,Good for experienced fans...,"I definitely feel that this trilogy as an all deserves a full four stars, for, if nothing else, the pure enjoyment I got out of reading it. Isn't that what Star Wars books are for? While the writing style was not as great as many of the others, considering how early on it written, this author made surprisingly few continuity mistakes. How was he to know at this time that the word for a popular stimulative drink in the Star Wars universe is ""caf"" and not ""coffeine""? However, if these small details really bother you, than stay away from this trilogy at all costs. As for the story, some parts of it are silly, but overall Lando was portrayed flawlessly, as was his irritating little companion. So,if you're an experienced Star Wars fan, and have read at least enough of the mainstream books to know the basic storyline, then yeah, these books are fun to read, but if you're just starting out, wait a while on these."
2,"This is Star Wars, the way it shouldn't be.","This is kind of a weak book. The plots were generally bad, the writing was slow, tedious, and missed the point of Lando. I disliked Vuffi Raa because the thought of the all powerful alien droid decided to team up with a smuggler (or allow himself to be won in a sabbac game like property) is ridiculous. The stories took too long to set up and get into, the threatening aspect was never really there, and what was up with the Imperial master mind? Was he an Imperial Moff, a Dark Jedi, or some stupid ignoramous in between?"
5,Way to go Chick!,"This is in my opinion, the best group that Chick Corea has ever been in, and will ever be in. (Unless they decide to get back together again.) The song selection is quite good, and each artist's playing is superb! Obviously don't expect to hear any rhodes or electric keyboards, hence the name of the album ""Akoustic Band,"" but that doesn't diminish the album any more. My favorite tracks are ""T.B.C. (Terminal Baggage Claim)"" and ""Spain,"" which is an alternate arrangement from his 1970's take. Very good cd."
5,The real thing,"When I think of Jazz, this is the sound I hear in my head. It's pure and clear. ""Spain"" is fabulous!"
5,Go cardinals! !,This was a great Halloween costume and great for any cards fan boy or girl. Good price. Money well spent.
2,Not my favorite historical,"In the 3rd book of the Roselynde series, we spend several years with Joanna and Geoffrey. This book was very frustrating for me, because all through the book (about five years), the two are completely in love and totally at odds. They're both miserable because neither will tell each other what is really going on. They're too busy trying to protect themselves and each other. Then, at the end, instead of us getting a glimpse of some kind of illuminating conversation, they're just suddenly happy and everything is perfect. Wait. What? I like the historical aspect of the book, but I'm not sure the story served any real purpose except to set up the next book in the series."
5,Much cheaper than walmart or auto parts store,Exact same filter they sell at walmart or an auto parts store. Save the money and buy online isntead of paying more dollars for local purchase.
2,Not as pictured,"I purchased this filter for my 2003 Toyota Matrix, base model (manual trans). In addition to going through the ""make sure it fits"" option here, I also visited the Fram site and received confirmation that the CA9482 was the proper filter for my Matrix.Upon receipt of the filter, the first thing I noticed was that the picture on the box looks nothing like the filter pictured here. Nor did the filter look anything like the one installed in my car. The Fram CA9482 filter is pure white and there is a plastic divider down the center of the filter folds. It did not fit.I went to a local auto parts store (not one of the franchised ones) and the filter they had, while a different brand, looked exactly like the photo shown here and fit perfectly.While Amazon took good care of me when I asked for a return voucher, something is wrong between Fram and its Chinese manufacturer."
4,"Excellent story, but English Sound...","Great little movie about the traumas of childhood and childrens' resilient, forgiving nature, dramatically and accurately illustrated in many scenes. No matter what happens, the little boy bounces back. Unfortunately, much of the dialogue is difficult to hear, and there are no English subtitles. Even using headphones doesn't offer that much help.This is typical of the 'English sound syndrome' (even though the movie is Australian), and I wonder how some movies can even be issued in this condition. Most American movies have at least some measure of re-recording and mixing rather than just pure location sound, not enhanced in any way."
1,negative review - there is a color problem with the dvd,there is a color problem with this dvd. it has a purple/green cast to it. i presumed i could not return for a credit/replacement since i opened the jacket.
2,Good price except for the postage,"The cost of the DVD was fine. I did object to paying as much again for the postage to arrive in Australia. Sorry but not worth the cost, especially as it was not shown any where until the order was complete."
3,Not So Good........,"""Romulus, My Father"", wow, catchy title right, with Eric Bana (Munich, Troy) and Franka Potente (Run, Lola Run), plus a true story, it must be good!No, its not! The performances by all actors/actresses were good, the story was boring, very boring.The opening scene is the father (Eric Bana) heating up hibernating bees, until they take flight, as it turns out, that is also the final scene of the movie.Trust me, its boring, don't say I didn't warn you..........."
3,Completely unrealistic,"Oh my. Where to start.. The book wasnt badly written. It didn't suck. But it sure was not realistic. The one realistic portrayal was of her customer and the relationship they had. The progression of her ""addiction,"" not so much. If you've ever done a drug I think you'll recognize that. If not, I guess this can be the cautionary, but flawed, tale you look to to find out what it's like."
3,Where is it?,I'm still waiting for this book to arrive! I ordered it about 2 weeks ago and I know it should be here by now. The other book I bought the same day as this one came to my house days ago.
5,Innocent Girl heads into disaster,"I couldn't stop reading this book, it was extremely captivating how one girl can go from an innocent life working at a fast-food joint like most teenagers do, to working at a topless bar in hopes of making more money for acting classes. Everything spirals down from there, yet she is so naive and believes that it is all for the better.I highly recommend this book! Not only for teens, but for adults as well. It takes us into a world that not many of us can experience firsthand."
3,Disappointed,"I wanted this book for so long. I was so excited to finally get it, and I wound up being pretty disappointed with the outcome. For me, it was too quick. I read the book in about 3 hours (with breaks). There wasn't enough detail about the characters or what they were going through. If the author would have put more time into it, this could have been a really good book. It seemed as if the author was rushing through the writing, and just wanted to be finished with it."
2,Not a gem,"I've read a lot of heroin memoirs/novels, and this is the absolute worst. Sam starts doing heroin so she break through her shyness while stripping. How cliche can you get? This book just feels like it was written by a high school student trying to make an after-school special. She even calls heroin her ""magical potion."" And is not at all freaked out by shooting up, because her CAT is DIABETIC so she's cool with needles. The real problem is that she's totally an idiot. ""Everyone says bad stuff about my new boyfriend, but they must be wrong, because I can look in his eyes and see innocence."" Basically I enjoyed reading it for the comedy."
2,misunderstood and unreal,"I'm honestly not a harsh critic but this book couldve been so much moredescriptive and powerful . It delivered a ""short story"" feel that you readbreifly. I bought this thinking it would be a memoir, the back of the bookwas very weak and created a fake image of the author. To feel for thewriting , you shouldn't have to become a heroin addict. Its like sayingsteriods enable athletes to be great, when really youre not an athlete ifsteriods make you win. Just as the author shouldnt have forced a habbitfor a character to be born."
1,Lame and toothless,It'd be perfect for an after school special or a life time original movie. It hits every cliché that I could imagine. I was surprised to see her hit all of them in one pretty short novel-way to go.
2,Not worth the price of the book,"I was very disappointed in this book after seeing the graphic cover shot and the enticing storyline. This girl gurgled down the tubes in THREE months - going from a complete innocent working as a waitress to a mobster's moll, smack shooting, bony-hipped, strutting stripper to an angst filled death. Uh....I *don't* think so!!! If the author was a heroin addict as she says, then she should certainly know better than to publish this dramatic skimpy piece of trash. Puh-leeze!"
3,"unrealistic, yet effective","As I began reading Beauty Queen, I didn't really like it. I felt that it was sort of unrealistic (it seems that Sam develops a herion habit over about three days), and the drug use felt very contrived. Despite these issues I had with the book, about halfway into it, I began to connect with Sam. Although you don't get to know her all that well in the short novel, small details about her--her taste in movies, her endearing naivete, make her a lovable character in many ways. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but felt the drug use was not portrayed very realistically."
3,Good...but it was missing a few things.,"From people I know that have used heroin, and many other books I've read on the subject, my understanding is that a person usually gets sick a few times before they become entirely addicted. Sam seemed to get hooked very quickly after being shot up once.Also, Angelo the gangster was a great character, but I found it hard to believe that he would risk his persona to ""publish"" Sam's diary. Of course, that would give him legitimacy.Lastly, I would have liked more illustrations of Sam getting dope sick. I think the powerful descriptions of what the body goes through in withdrawal sends a strong message out to kids who are romanced by the notion of being ""junkie cool.""Anyway, I really enjoyed the book and I will recommend it to a lot of the kids at the high school I work at. The message does come through loud and clear, only I would have liked a few more elements expanded. I hope the author writes some more!"
5,A Great Book!,"I very much recommend this book. After THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, a down-and-out story of a hapless writer addicted to personal ads, it's the best book I read so far this year. BEAUTY QUEEN is about a girl named Sam who's having trouble with money, her mother, and her mother's abusive boyfriend. She decides to move out into her own apartment. Since money is hard to come by when all she's doing is working at a fast food place, she decides to become an exotic dancer. Sam later on gets addicted to heroin. And slips into the hash reality of drugs. A superb book and a must read! I couldn't stop caring about what happened. Like all great books it's a little disturbing and not something I'm bound to forget soon! Try this book!"
4,book is sooooo disturbing its good,"omg! my name is samantha (like the character in the book) and my best friend's name is Nicole...(like the best friend in the book.) anyway, i think that if Samantha had a lot more people who DIDN'T do drug around her maybe things would of been different. i kinda feel sorry for her because no one really loved her the way she wanted to be loved."
5,This Is An Absolute Must Read... An Amazing Book,"Since the reviews here already tell you what it's about, let me just put in my two cent about it. It is THE best book I have ever read. I checked it out from my library one morning just to get a grade for my English class. Little did I know I found my favorite book ever. I started reading it in my second class and finished that afternoon. I couldn't put it down! After I got done reading, I wanted more (It has a shocking ending, I'm not saying that it just leaves you hanging)! I told everyone about it. And, even though I already read it... I'm going to buy it just to have it around... I could honestly read it over 100 times... and still LOVE it!"
2,"Good, but not beautiful.","This book has a strong premise, but the story falters.You'd think an author who had been through heroin addiction would be able to write a more believable, gripping narrative, but that is not the case with Beauty Queen. Sam's journal entries peg her as naive and idealistic, and even in the throes of addiction, she remains unrealistically optimistic. You feel bad for her; not only for her situation, but for the fact that she remains so incredibly oblivious up until the end.This book is akin to Go Ask Alice, minus the introspection. It's a sugarcoated look at the world of heroin, probably most suited for younger, less discerning readers. It lacks the profane truth that i feel is nessacary for a story of this sort to really hit you... If you want a ""nicer"", more vague account, Beauty Queen is for you. It's worth reading once, but I'd recommend borrowing it from the library or buying it used."
1,"Overpriced, ill-fitted, and cheap","I previously reviewed these sheets shortly after I received them. Now I have all sorts of new things to say about them. I got them in early March (or late February) 2008. It is now June 2008. These sheets feel cheap, they are not soft, they hardly fit my 21-inch mattrest, and were insanely expensive. They pill!! They feel like carpet, now. I bought a Wamsutta set at Bed Bath and Beyond for $95 (admittedly, they were on sale) and they are TWICE as good as than this set. Don't waste your money, time, or shipping dollars on these incredibly cheap and rough sheets. (Did I mention that I almost gave myself a concussion getting the fitted sheet around the mattress? And it STILL didn't fit all the way down to the bottom and tuck underneath.)"
2,600 tc Egyptian cotton sheet set,"I purchased this sheet set for a xl-full bed, it falls off the bed, had a stain already on the sheet set and the company does not send you a packing slip or any information on how to contact them about a problem with their product.For a luxury sheet set I would not order from them again."
2,Not impressed,"Though this book dishes some dirt, it was poorly written. Just a vapid look at Pam's life. I had a hard time finishing it. I don't think I'll read the sequel."
5,True Page Turner,"I absolutely loved this book. Once I started reading it I could NOT put it down. Ms. Anderson wrote it so cleverly, switching names of places and people around and using such descriptive detail, making you feel as though you were right there with her, experiencing every step she took towards fame. Definitley an inspirational book. Makes you realize that anything is possible, and alot of times the amazing, wonderful blessings life brings you, come when you least expect it. Five stars no doubt for ""Star"""
2,Blah blah blah,"I wasn't too impressed with this book. So she can tell someone to write a story, there's more to Pam then this b.s. I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping it would be more. I guess from all the hype I should have known it was a dud. Come one Pam, you can do better then a junior high quality story."
3,"Amusing, Quirky and a little vicarious thrill","Yes I admit it, I enjoyed this book. It was cute and quirky and made me wonderwhat parts of the crazy plot she'd actually truly done. Although the last 50pages or so seemed to just zoom in to get the story told quickly, almost likethey felt they took too much time developing the story and decided (...)Ihave to wrap this up now.I will admit this book is not for the feint of heart when it comes tosensuality/sexuality. There are some hmmmm ""group"" scenes that might turnpeoples heads, so be forewarned before reading. If it was a movie rating it'dbe R to almost NC 17, as far as certain scenes go, but those are few and farbetween, however, this book is fun, quirky, and a little bit slutty, vicariousthrills are meant to be fun :) And that is what this is pure fun wrapped inpink wrapping.I rated it average because it literally just seemed to end. So I was bummed Iwanted to read more about the small town girl in the big bad city and all herexploits."
2,So can any guess who's who?,"So this book was okay a little slow at first but it seemed really short towards the end because she squeezes so much into 250 pages. This book wasn't really that great, I guess the only thing that really kept me interested was the who's who of celebrities she was using, I kinda guessed everyone else but who were Peter and Van supposed to be? O and the baseball player and surfer? or were they made up???"
2,Needs more depth . . .,"This story has potential, but I feel it was poorly written and underdeveloped. It simply lacks depth and reads more like something written on an 8th grade reading level. The last half of the book is filled with mostly Star (the main character) having sex with one character after another. You just never really get underneath the surface of the character and into her mind and how she deals with all the new found fame and fortune. I think it could have been a great story had it just dove deeper into the main character. Hopefully, there will be some improvements in the subsequent novels as I really would enjoy reading them."
2,I really really wanted to like this book!,"But, when I finished it, I decided that liking it, even slightly, wasn't really an option.I am giving it two stars for her effort. Writing a book is hard (granted, it's easier when you have a ghostwriter) and for Pam's first book she gave it a valliant try.The book's tempo isn't steady, which makes it rather confusing to read. Events aren't focused on enough, or consequently focused on too much, and this makes it difficult to discern what the important things are.Maybe if she just wrote a tell-all book about the people she's slept with rather than turning it into a poorly-written novel, I would be more entertained."
4,Easy adult read,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book. I found it to be a light, easy read. Perfect for summer time reading. I thought it was so funny to see the similarities between Star and Pam, and see how the names and places were disguised. I thought it ended rather abruptly, until I realized there was a second book out. I will definitely purchase that one as well. As for some of the graphic scenes? No worse than any of the other trashy novels out there, or most of the 'R' rated movies out nowadays. At least she wasn't trying to hide where she came from."
3,Give Pam a break!,"Okay. so Star was a pretty good book. I was skeptical about but I bought it, read it and really liked it. I will read Starstruck. Hopefully the stories will continue because Pam is a good storyteller! I guess its true that real life is weirder than fiction!"
4,Check Your Brain At The Door,A fun and frivilous read for light entertainment. A thinly veiled account of Pamela Anderson's rise to fame. On par with Jackie Collins.
1,"Not fun enough to be called ""The Worst Book Ever Written""","Pam Anderson is such a self-effacing Hollywood commodity that I foolishly expected more from this book...at least some humor or insight into the self-manufactured showbiz machine she has become. Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page. It actually IS a book you can put down. It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque. Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author? I think probably so. Too bad for her readers and/or fans. If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift."
2,Only read if you are die-hard Pammy fan!,"I'm not afraid to admit that I have been a fan of Pamela Anderson for the last 15 years or so. I'm sure I'm not the only male who is/was mesmerized by Ms. Anderson's ""charms."" I ordered this book since she mentioned it was loosely based on her life. Although I knew most of the facts of her career since she made it big, it was interesting to get them in a more ""personalized"" point of view. Some details were not known to me at all (such as the time before the fame) & in some cases one had to ""read between the lines."" This was a fairly easy read, something very light. I was looking for some pulp fiction to read while I was at work. It doesn't require deep concentation or anything. Easy read, with a good writing style, but I still think the book could have been better. If you were expecting some deep philosophical truths, psychological revelations or some innovative literary work, you are most definitely in the wrong section!"
5,An EXELLENT read,"This book was suprisingly great. ive been a fan of pam's for a while, and i was very impressed by this book. while its not a literary masterpiece, its funny, witty,sexy, and overall entertaining.(:"
2,Didn't know what to expect,"While walking through the bookstore, I made a rather nasty comment about Pamela Anderson writing a book. Two of the stores employees overheard me and assured me that I needed to read it to believe it. They said it was excellent, wonderful, etc. Upon their advice, I bought it. They must have been thinking about another book, because this was horrible. I only give it two stars because she managed to keep me somewhat interested in the plot in order to keep reading."
2,Very Disappointing,"I really like Pam, in every interview I've seen she's funny, witty and surprisingly intelligent. I'm thrilled she uses her celebrity to help various animal causes. When I saw she released a book I was quite excited. After reading it I must say I'm filled with disappointment. Don't read it unless you want almost 300 pages of self appreciation from her. I really did expect more from her, especially since she used a ghost writer."
3,Ehh,"So I bought this book like 3 days ago and I'm almost done with it. It's not a horrible book. Not by far, I've read book that were horrible, and some written by accomplished authors. But, because Pamela used a GHOSTWRITER, I assumed it would be written in a better prose than I used when I was in the 8th grade.Writing style aside, I acquired a love/hate relationship with the main character Esther ""Star"" Wood Leigh. At times she is lovable, but other time I want to strangle her. Star basically humps everything that moves, and has no common sense at all. Even people who hail from the smallest town in Booniesville, Hickstown know what baggage check is.Also I know it was suppose to be cute, but it irked the crap out of me that every chapter was a song title, and Star encounters the song within the chapter.Don't get me wrong, I intent to finish this novel, and I may even read Star Struck, but it still gets me annoyed every once in a while."
5,I loved the book.,I love the book. I can't wait to read the sequel. I hope I don't have to wait to long. I couldn't put this book down. It is so interested to hear how the other half lives. I am such a huge fan of Pamela Anderson. Great Job Pamela.
3,Biography as Novel with Reversable Cover,"Star Wood Leigh is the star of this biography/novel. Star and her life are based, to some extent, on Pamela. By taking this approach, Pamela can take parts of her life and experiences and spice them up with some fiction and a plot. Does it work? Well, that really needs to be left up to the reader.The revealing cover with its strategically placed stars will appeal to a certain segment of the population. The fact that the cover is two-sided and can be reversed to reveal a star-free version tells you where this book is aimed. Although sometimes compared to chick-lit, real chick-lit would not pull such a stunt.If you are a Pamela Anderson fan you will surely enjoy the book and you will probably substitute Pamela's name for Star's as you read it. While not for everyone, this is bound to be a big seller."
2,Too many inconsistencies....,"I wonder who edited this book? I really wanted to like it too, but it was all over the place. In the beginning, Star is described as a natural athlete who is super smart, then she is described as not a natural at anything but a really dedicated hard worker, and finally, she is described as someone who didn't work hard enough and wasn't really good at anything. And that's just in the first five chapters! I just can't figure out why nobody else picked up on all of the inconsistencies. (That was just one example!) I know this is fiction, and I have to give Anderson credit for writing a book, but it comes off as unpolished, and I really blame whoever told her that it was ready for print. A little bit more time and it could have been a really entertaining read! Don't waste your time, it's not worth it. And Pam, if you are going to write another book, find a new ghost writer and editor!"
1,Help Me,"OMG I was so interested in reading this book until I got to the about the 40th page. I couldn't stand anymore HOW stupid Pamela Anderson made this Star turn out to be. This book also jumped all over the place. It was the most boring, unintelligable piece of trash I have ever read in my life. Matter of fact it's still sitting on my floor where I threw it 2 weeks ago."
1,who's the sleaze?? The publisher,"This book is just living proof of the (...)and sell-out of celebrity today and the major publishing companies, who should be hung for publishing trash like this and calling it works of serious fiction. Hemingway, Faulkner and Orwell amongst others have to be tossing in their grave. As God awful that Star is, it's even more fake (than Pam's breasts) to think she actually had any hand in putting a sentence into this work. I can see her now after a long hard day, firing up the computer and writing and writing, the whole five minutes she probably put into this crap. (...)"
1,waste of trees,"I thought that maybe, just maybe, Ms. Anderson would show some hidden literary talent. After all, the book actually got published and there was some hype about it, but I guess I was completely wrong. If an unknown person had submitted this to a publishing house, it would have never gone to press. This may not be the worst book I ever read, but it definitely rates right up there."
1,Struggling to get through it.......,This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I am literally struggling to get through it. The main character is the most naive idiot and the dialogue is unbearable. She doesn't know what the minibar in her hotel is. She actually thinks the people before her must have left all of the contents therefore she'd better not take anything. There is a gay fair happening in Santa Monica and she asks where the rides are. She enters a mans house illuminated by candlelight and she asks him if he forgot to pay his electric bill. C'mon!!! Nobody is that clueless!
4,Pam Anderson has suprised me!!!,"I thought this book was a fun, easy, enjoyable read. I could not put it down. Even though it is fiction it seems to be based on Pamela Andersons life. I can't wait till the ""Star Struck"" to be published"
1,Shitty ending,This book was really good all the way to the end. The problem is the end sounded more like the middle. I was left with so many questions and no answers. After I finished reading I was pissed off and realized that Pam Anderson only did that so you have to buy the sequel. Screw that.
2,maybe it would be unfair for me to review this...,"first off, i thought this was an autobiography, not a fictional novel. i didn't finish the whole book because it was so boring. maybe it gets good in the middle or the end. but i couldn't stay up while reading it."
5,A map for Map Weenies,"Although Aruba is a small island, it's nice to have a high quality,indestructable map that provides the detail that is usually absent from most guidebooks.If you're a ""map weenie"", this is a great one!"
5,Plan to Rely On It,"Good quality, laminated, looks plenty detailed. I'll let you know how accurate it actually was after I return from Aruba!"

I did see a commercial that said they've come out with a new """"fresher"""" version. I would probably not purchase this product again."
1,I think my teeth got yellow-er,"This is the worst toothpaste I have ever used in my life, my teeth look worse than they ever have and I'm not doing anything different except using this product. Don't get your hopes up if you buy this, regular toothpaste keeps your teeth whiter than this stuff does! I figured the word 'ultimate' would at least ensure that it helped or at least kept my teeth the same. I'm almost done with this tube and I'm going back to my trusty Crest."
1,Aquafresh toothpaste features fluoride. I heard that fluoride ...,"Aquafresh toothpaste features fluoride. I heard that fluoride is the main ingredient in fighting cavities, and that it hardens the outer enamel of teeth, which makes them less susceptible to decay."
4,Aquafresh has scored again with its Advanced Whitening ...,Aquafresh has scored again with its Advanced Whitening Toothpaste with Fluoride. This product works as smoothly from the tube as it does on your teeth. The end result is a clean fresh taste without the abrasive grit that many competitors have. All this and whiter teeth too. It's very convincing when you compare it to all the other toothpaste products on today's market.
4,Different angles . . . sometimes even from the gutter.,"BUT STILL, LIKE AIR, I'LL RISE is from cover to cover an angle on America Theatre often left alone by most of the mainstream, except during ethnic appreciation month, or whatever. So, yes it is very refreshing to have an anotholgy so compact. It's like a treasure for your library of great Asian America plays.However, the content of the plays is not G, PG, or PG13 on average. Some of the plays are dirty for the sake of being dirty. I don't think that is a reason to not buy BUT STILL, LIKE AIR, I'LL RISE, but I'm sure you'll appreciate the warning."
1,product info,"Why ?.Must have info. Is it a removeable crock? What setting? How would I know to buy,if only ?'s?"
5,Indescribable.,"If my love for this treasure was an ocean, you'd have to take 5 airplanes 2 get across it. I practically worship this cd- It is the best piano album I ever bought. Period. I've listened to it 5 million times in the 4 months I've had it, and I am not ONE BIT tired of it. It's so relaxing, perfect to fall asleep too, and when I really am waiting for spring, this cd almost never leaves my player. This cd has a variety of piano songs- There are medium paced ones like the title track and Cast Your Fate to the Wind, there are slow, sad songs like After the Snow Falls, and great up-beat songs like Cat on a Windowsill. Great music, great cd, great pianist- enough said. I recommend it to any music lover."
5,Fabulous Touch.... Fabulous Music,"David Benoit has one of the best touches on a piano in the modern jazz world. He is able to evoke deep feeling, or light and airy like no one. Take for example, ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind"" He definately feels the music as it was intended to be felt. A must have for every smooth jazz fan."
3,Good,I had high hopes for this cd. It wasn't quite what I had expected however it is definitely a cd to add to the collection.
4,Clueless,"Very good short history of the Bible. Synopsis' of the individual books of the Bible. Really makes it clear. Great for beginning Bible readers, or those that want a more indepth look in a simpler way."
5,Great Little Book!!!,I am a new Christian and this is a great little reference book to have. It explains so much. It is clear as day. I am happy I got it.
5,Father Gilbert,"The item was in great condition, and I really enjoy all of Focus on the Families, Father Gilbert CD's. I wish they would make more."
1,Catherine,"I'm sorry I can't write a reveiw because the book was not in English,and I dom't know how to return it for English,PLEASE HELP,THANKS"
4,Good beginning...,"This is a very good start for a very good band. Although it doesn't compare to their followup full length, Freewheelin, fans of Tuesday can really enjoy the music and lyrics while newcomers can appreciate their talents."
4,Insightful and helpful,"I enjoyed reading this book; it did help me through losing a friend. I like the variety of voices represented, some logical, others more emotional, and some of the stories are truly heartbreaking."
3,Maybe the loss is still too new...,"I found this book insightful but not helpful. Maybe I was looking for answers, advice, something to help me through my own sadness. I am truly happy for the authors that have rekindled their friendship, yet sad for our's, as that will never happen."
2,Hard to really like any of the friends,"When you think about it--if the friendships blew up, burned out of faded away (most of them blew up or burned out) then the friendship really wasn't that good to begin with. Perhaps because of the short story approach, I didn't really get a good sense of why these women were friends to begin with and also, not much of a sense of loss when the friendships ended. I did finish the book for my bookclub and it will lead to very good discussion on what is friendship, and our personal experiences of losing friends (or being lost as a friend). Other than that, wouldn't really recommend it."
2,What a bummer!,"I really had very high expectations for this book. I don't think I was able to really relate to many of these stories. I think many of the writers were trying too hard to make very prophetic statements and/or show off their writing abilities instead of keeping to a story and just trying to relate to the audience. Very few stories actually describe the friendship and how that friendship (or the end of it) affected their lives and instead focus on what events they were personally going through (which is definitely important but not the reason for the friendship's demise). After recently losing a very close friend of mine, I felt that maybe this book could help me by providing some comfort with similar experiences but instead the stories had no affect on me whatsoever. I didn't sense any GREAT sadness or loss felt by any of the authors."
4,Smart and Courageous,"In society as a whole not enough attention gets paid to the complicated course of friendships. The end of a friendship can oftentimes be as painful as the end of a romantic relationship--more so because it frequently goes unacknowledged. Congrats to Jenny Offill and Elissa Schappell for assembling a collection that honors the sometimes difficult, sometimes down right heart rending subject of broken friendships. I enjoyed the majority of essays in this collection. There were a few that didn't resonate with me, but still worth the read."
1,The Crucible of Women's Friendships,"This is a wonderful book that most readers will enjoy. I think the vignettes or more illustrative of the vagaries of women's friendships, than, say, a more academic analysis of love, jealousy, betrayal and hurt feelings among friends.My one and only complaint is that I hope she does a follow up book that looks at the same issue, but one that also includes online ""friendships."" I think that the increased use of myspace, facebook, and other bbs and online forums also provides fodder for this genre."
4,Friendsickness never ends,"I picked up this book because of the intriguing title and cover. As a close observer of adolescent girls and their friendships, the stories of adult women and the ""what happens after"" drew me in. I also wondered if the friendships discussed were fractured by the same relationally aggressive behaviors I see regularly in teens. Not much had changed. Jealousy, exclusion, gossip, and, in paricular, competition over a man (who goes blameless) seems capable of driving a wedge between women across the decades. Still, the sense of sad longing for something treasured and lost renews my belief that making a friendship work is worth it."
3,Okay tool,It's an ok tool of picking up the pecans because the pecans sometimes falling out from the bucket and it doesn't work good of picking up the pecans on the high tall grass. What you paid is what you get out of a inexpensive tool.
5,Love it,This makes it so much easier to pick up pecans. I have a bad back and bending over was painful.
3,had to repair unit before I could use it,part came in disassebled ... mountining hole was misalined and capture pin was bent beyond use ... I had to dremil out the center mounting hole to be able to attach the head of the unit to the extender handle ... replaced the capture pin with a cotter pin ... the was able to use the unit ... got about a bushel of pecans picked up with it after that and it is still working fine
4,Needed repair,"I ordered two of these for my Mom, an avid pecan collector in the fall. The head and pole are shipped disassembled. You merely thread the head on the pole. One was fine. The other would not thread. The hole in the cap on the pole was off center from the threaded nut beneath. I sized a drill bit and drilled the hole larger. Fixed. These are the Bomb-Diggity and makes picking up pecans much less work."
4,"Slightly biased, but still very good photographs and info!","This is good primer for those that know little to nothing about the brutal and chaotic history of Nicaragua. Pictures really do say a 1,000 words!"
2,Not so great,"We have had this duck cover for about a year. Our daughter (19 months) loves this duck...but she loves all ducks. My husband and I HATE this cover! It does it's job- it's stays on and protects our daughter from hitting her head on the spout BUT we have the hardest time getting the darn thing off! It doesn't just slip off, you have to tug and pull to remove it when bathtime is over. The inside of the hat is also moldy. Time to buy a new, different kind of faucet cover! I think there are better ones out there!"
1,Do not buy this.....,The duck is cute and yes my kids did not hit their heads on the faucet but it did wedge itself in between the wall and my faucet and caused flooding in two room downstairs. We didn't even noticed but know we have a hole in the ceiling in two rooms a week before Christmas! $15 duck and $300 in repairs.
2,Cute but not practical...,"Our 10 month old daughter loves the design and it keeps her safe from the spout. However, no one mentions how inconvenient this is for a spout that also works for diverting water to a shower head. This has become problematic in that you have to remove the duck each time after use if you intend to use the shower. In the process, it has been both destroying the duck (it won't stay on anymore) and it has pulled the spout out of the wall from constant handling. I would only recommend if you have another method for turning on the shower."
4,Not made for faucets that have the pull-up shower knob,"Overall, this duck has been great, and has prevented a few bumps on the head. To get it to work with our faucet though, we had to cut out the plastic under the duck's hat (the part that is supposed to dispense bubbles) so that we could still pull up the knob for the shower. It was NOT easy to do, but once it was done, we never had to remove the duck to shower anymore."
5,Like this...,"This is a neat little spout cover. The hat on the duck lifts so you can pour the bubble bath into it, so it slowly drizzles to make alot of bubbles. would recommend."
5,Cute spout guard,"We wanted a ducky theme for our son's bathroom. We got this and the Ducky Tub Rug, Jr. This ducky spout guard is cute and does it's job. The bubble bath dispenser works, too (my husband and I like to use that!)"
4,cute - makes bath time fun,Makes a nice addition to bath time. Works like it is supposed to and the baby really seems to enjoy it.
2,Cute But Doesn't Fit,"This spout cover is really cute, but it didnt work with my tub spout. It was too small. My spout is a little wider at the back where it is against the tile, and the duck couldn't slide all the way on."
1,Poorly written,"I agree with the reviewer who called it a cut and paste job, but disagree with the ""Not bad"" judgement. This is nearly impossible to read if you don't already have an extensive background in the subject (a PhD might help). The author skips from battles to intrigues to poets inside 3 paragraphs in a staccato fashion. I would recommend ""The Teaching Company"" lectures as a far better way to learn about early modern civilizations. Caveat: I have given up after reading the first 4 parts as it just isn't a pleasant read leaving part 5 for other reviewers who are more resistant to this writer's style."
4,DIVIT ROCKS,This an absolutely amazing album from these Nor Cal boys. Its like Jimmy eat world meets Bad Religion. A lot of good songs except for maybe No regrets which i think is their weakest song on the album but it is a catchy song and you'll probbaly like it the first few times. Anyways good album.
3,"Tips for writing cover, followup, and thank you letters.","This book is aimed at the professional or technical person. This will not be helpful for the unskilled or blue collar worker. However, there are tips found in several sections of the book that are interesting and useful for everyone. As an unemployment consultant for those who are primarily not college educated nor professionals, I did not find this to be the best resource."
4,Helpful for the cover letter 'rookie',"101 Best Cover Letters is a good buy if you are struggling with putting together just the right words for a great cover letter. Gives some ""common sense"" tips, but also a variety of styles (i.e. responding to classified ad, how to incorporate a reference, specific careers) for your letter. Obviously you still have to make your cover leter your own, but this book definitely helps get the wheels turning."
3,GET A HARD COPY!!!,great cover letter book (5 stars)not good in electronic format. the example cover letters are not scalable! this makes it nearly impossible to read.
5,Best on the market,"This is the best book of its kind on the market. It's letters were varied and covered more topics than I needed, but will use in the future. Definitely worth the [money]!"
1,101 Flattering cover letters for sycophants,The example letters are uniformly dreadful. Marginal grammar and usage combine with a sacherine style aimed at kissing up to second-raters. These letters are guaranteed to repell anyone with whom one would really like to work.
1,Be cafeful of what you eat!,"This video is a documentary about a man who is on a journey to lose weight. Unfortunately, there was a lot of foul language. I threw video in the trash!"
3,Uneven performances of fine chamber music,"Of the available discs devoted to the fine chamber music by the great Swiss composer Frank Martin (1890-1974), this sadly must rank low. Its main appeal will be for Martin ""completists,"" as it contains 2 works not otherwise available: the Etudes for 2 Pianos - the composer's own transcription of his 1955-56 Etudes for String Orchestra - & the brief, catchy Overture & Foxtrot for 2 Pianos (1924). They are performed well by the Duo Beersheva & adequately engineered. The quality of the other performances is variable, & that of the lovely 1921 Ronsard Sonnets (for mezzo-soprano, flute, viola & cello) is frankly unfortunate. There are better performed & better recorded versions of all these pieces in other all-Martin collections: the Sonnets on ASV CD DCA 1010, the Trio on Irish Folk Tunes on Jecklin-Disco JD 646-2, the Ballade for Trombone & Piano on Bis CD-71, & the 2 brief pieces for piano solo on Gallo CD-636."
3,very adorable but sheds,Bought this for my 11 year old. She wore leggings and long sleeve t- shirt underneath. It was very adorable but the leg warmers and tail shed badly.
3,Adorable Costume,This costume and all the pieces is really cute. I sent it to my grand daughter in Australia. She had to have a cat costume for school. She loved it. I'm not sure it could be washed because of the fake fur.
1,Dee,Ordering and Return was fine! For the money this was total garbage! It is small for normal size. I paid 28.00 for costume then 7.00 for shipping and 10.00 to return. I was out the money for that. I wish I never order it in the first place.
4,Remington Steele,"I honestly did not like this season five as much as the other seasons-I thought the ending was just a little bit too contrived, but all in all I am happy with my purchase!"
2,DVD Failure on reverse sides,Finally have time to watch these last Seasons.Very disappointed even thoughCharacters and plots are very enjoyableWHEN I CAN GET THE DVD TO PLAY !!About 1/3 of the episodes can't be viewed.Most episodes on the reverse side constantly freeze orsimply won't play at all....m
3,"4 Yes, 5 No","The last real season of Remington Steele, while not up to the level of the prior three, is still worthy of fans' attention. A few stinker episodes (the evil Santas episode, especially; with a nod to Laura as a stewardess; both dreadful), but on the whole a good time. S5 shouldn't even exist. Lame story arc; betrayal of who and what the main characters were; the incredibly annoying Roselli; idiotic fairy tale ending. It was like NBC was punishing Pierce Brosnan, who had his first shot at James Bond, but missed out because NBC owned him and made him do this rump season of the show. My wife and I hated S5 when it aired; we hated it still when we watched again last year."
5,the final season,"i have enjoyed this series & will watch it again. on a rainy day, i look forward to watching a Remington Steel marathon."
5,Steele loving it!,"I loved the Remington Steele series and still do. I had no idea what a huge impact Laura Holt made on my little junior high and highschool life until I watched the shows as an adult woman. She was strong, smart, and classy, and that's what I wanted to be. To this day I love a man in cuff links. My husband has a huge collection and now he knows why (seeing that I make him watch all the DVD's with me). I always adored the witty banter and the quarky situations that Laura, Mildred, and Steele ended up in and I don't care if season 4 and 5 don't meet the standards of the originals. These DVD's always bring a smile to my face and give my husband and I something witty to watch around 5:oo when all that is on is a two hour stint of ""Seventh Heaven."""
5,The Best for Last,"I am a big Remington Steele fan and loved ""Season 5."" Season 4 was fantastic, but it was at this time that Pierce was up for the role of James Bond and NBC was not certain if they wanted to renew the show. Bonds of Steele, the last episode had great ratings which led to the mini series called season 5 to tie up the show. I loved the fact that after Steele had so many ex-girlfriends, it was time for Laura to have a serious suitor as well. Check out the excellent comedic timing between Pierce and Stephanie in ""Steele Hanging in There"" when the Steeles' return from their honeymoon and throw a dinner party for Gladys Lynch. Also check out the wonderful wardrobe for both. In earlier seasons, the network wanted Stephanie to have a hipper wardrobe. I love the return of her hats and more elegant outfits. Pierce's suites are are gorgeous as well! I will be glad to finally have this on DVD!"
2,One Season Too Long,"Something went terribly wrong between season three and four of this otherwise wonderful series. The ratings plummeted as a result (poorer scripts, marked indifference in the actor's performances, etc), and the show was canceled. Fortunately (or UNfortunately, depending on your point of view), Brosnan was under consideration at the time for the new James Bond, and NBC in their infinite ""wisdom"" brought the series back for a ""fifth"" season. In reality, it was only a series of 2 hour made for TV movies, showing Steele and Holt in their ""married life"". These movies were laughable and did not do justice to the series.My rating for this is actually 2 1/2 (Amazon does not allow half stars), 3 stars for Season 4, 2 stars for Season 5. Do yourself a favor and purchase Seasons 1 - 3, and only buy this DVD if you are a huge a RS fan, otherwise you'll be disappointed."
3,DVD problems disappoint,"I purchased the full Remington Steele series (Seasons 1 - 5). When one episode on the third season disc wouldn't play due to technical problems, I was annoyed, but I was really disappointed when the season 5 disc had problems preventing me from watching the last episodes of the series."
5,Remington Steele Seasons Four and Five,"I love Remington Steele , so I am very happy with this set. I have been looking for awhile so i could complete my collection."
4,Need to be a fan,"The first three season are great....but it goes down hill from there. Season 4 is really the final season because they never complete the 5th but leaves the fans hanging. But if you are a fan, you will need to buy all five seasons. It is a shame they canceled the show as the interplay between all three actors was really working for three seasons. Maybe they will do like they did with another hit series, Man from U.N.C.L.E., and produce a ""Return of Remington Steel"" to at least put an proper ending to what could have been aa wonderful 5th season instead of leaving it undone. After all, isn't that what they promised with ""To be continuned"" on the last episode."
4,Loved this show back when and still love it now!,This was such a great show! perfect blend of comedy and crime stopping. A show that was entertaining back then and still is today.
2,Defective product,"I love Remington Steele, and I greatly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and 3.I was excited about receiving Seasons 4 and 5.Unfortunately, one of the DVD's in the set froze my computer during a specific episode, every time I tried to play it.Amazon was kind enough to replace the defective set.When I received my second copy of Seasons 4 and 5, I popped it into my DVD/CD player, and sure enough, it froze my computer during the same episode, every time.Amazon has now informed me that as ""the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.""I expect to receive a full refund from Amazon, but needless to say, I am very disappointed with this product."
3,bad sound,"Bayou Country sounds dreadful. Don't know if they're all like this, but mine sounds like it was taken from a scratchy record. You've been warned. Also, all the Cds have the same artwork. Pendulum isn't all on one disc. This could've been so much better."
5,Creedence history,"This set has to be the best historical set of Creedence Clearwater Revival.The remix is excellent which allows you to enjoy this ""classic"" compilation in digital sound.If you are a CCR fan this is a must have set!!"
5,Stunning,"I once owned all of the original issues of CCR CDs from the late eighties.They have passable sound quality. But this Box Set is Creedence Done Right. The Guitar notes at the end of ""Who'll Stop The Rain""are so clear and lifelike you can not only hear the harmonics in them but you can taste them as well. ""Up Around The Bend"" jumps out of the speakers with renewed vigor.The same is true for the rest of the set. Live In Europe sounded a little fuzzy and on CD. Not a complete tragedy just a little muted. Here it sounds fresh and spirited.It also includes two songs (Door To Door & Sweet Hitch-Hiker) that were left off of the original CD.For the true CCR fan this is a must have. It is a well deserved, and well done digital overhaul of the songs of a classic band."
5,What more could you ask for,"great recordings, everything from CCR that u could want along with some really good live recordings."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I knew the CCR stuff would be great but the early stuff is awesome too!! As good as many 60s great groups stuff -- Who, Yardbirds, Hollies and Stones included. WOW!!!!"
3,Christian love wins out in the end!,"This is a fairly simple, gentle read about a Christian romance. A nice read and probably women would enjoy it more so than men. Unfortunately for me it was sorely in need of good editing and proof reading though"
5,Christian romance book,This was a great book about 2nd and even 3rd chances. The main character was totally believeable and you wanted to smack him part of the time and you cheered for him the rest of the time. It was very uplifting and encouraging.
3,Feels preachy to me,"I love Christian fiction & Christian romance. But reading this book made me feel like I picked up a devotional rather than fun fiction. It's okay and I don't really regret reading it, but it wasn't that enjoyable."
2,Video memory is shared with PC Memory,"I believe in dedicated video memory. This machine belongs to my brother and as a computer techie, I got to support it for him for I'm guessing four years now. He has been using it with a wired network as a desktop replacement. No problems except the wired network adapter failed after all this time. I went to switch to the wireless network and it doesn't work. Research shows it is supposed to have a wifi adapter built it, but the on-off switch does nothing and there is not ""on"" light as depicted in the manual. So either that is broken, or else he got screwed buying a machine that doesn't have a wifi adapter like the labels say, or else it never worked.I gave it two stars for the lack of dedicated video memory and the networking problems. I'll update this review later after I take the machine apart."
1,where are the solutions?,"I find the title ""back pain SOLUTIONS"" being totally misleading.The text is all too general and provides ""solutions"" such as telling you to be posture aware and lie in a prone position if you are in pain...The author keeps plugging the Alexander technique (he is a former teacher)and rambles on about Semantics (his Ph.D is in General Semantics)All in all, this book didn't even give me any new nor helpful information on the subject. A good online search would have probably provided more.Even aesthetically speaking, the text in poorly written and the diagrams are pixelated, giving out the feeling that this was a poor attempt to make a book out of notes from a seminar.I would urge you to check the book out in a bookstore, before purchasing it !As for exercising postural awareness, I would definitely recommend Eric Franklin's books."
1,Poor Product,"Headphone jack was became defective within 1 week. Unit didn't come with any kind of clip, strap, or lanyard to hold it. Earbuds were the useless kind that won't stay in your ears. Not recommended."
3,"He has escaped, really... buy the debut instead","In a nutshell, this is nowhere near as good as the debut which was in my humble opinion flawless... even if they did borrow from Ray Davies and Donovan from time to time. For this CD they unfortunately used a differn't producer [it sounds boring and flat compared to Liam Watson's brilliant but simple production on the debut], they shortened the band name to the IV Thieves, have crappy artwork /no real liner notes... all of which has turned these guys into an average english rock band, there are a few decent tunes on here but nothing as striking or as memorable as what was on his debut [Nic Armstrong & The Thieves] It's unfortunate because I thought these guys were really doing that retro thang sincerely... better than most. I say it's almost tolerable [buy at your own risk] if you prefer sweet sincere melodic songs with a dash of old timey rock n roll then pickup the debut... either way they are probably still a great live band."
5,It doesn't get better than this.,"I've had the LP version of this for 35 years. If you've heard any Otis Spann whatsoever and liked it, you will love this. Trust me. Get it before you can't get it any more."
4,Taking Liberty - a fun fast read.,"I read this book in High School, and can still remember it 13 years later. It was a fast fun read, with plenty of action, suspense and intrigue"
2,A Mediocre Book at Best,"The number of typographical errors in this textbook is utterly astounding. This is completely unacceptable for a text that many medical students will use as gospel for physiology. In addition, much of the book goes into excruciating and unecessary detail, making it extremely slow to read. There are only a few positive things to say: (1) the renal and endocrine sections are quite good and (2) the clinical vignettes provide important information. There are far better texts available, try Guyton's ""Textbook of Medical Physiology,"" already in its ninth edition."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This textbook was our ""required text"" during first year medical school. I always assumed that bribery of some sort resulted in this situation, as I cannot find any redeeming qualities of this book except that it makes an excellent doorstop. Why is this book a waste of your time? Under the assumption that you are a medical student, let me tell you: it's way too detailed for any medical student to dream of ever learning during first year physiology. Let's face it- we have a lot to learn in an extremely short amount of time, and the time must be rationed wisely. Most students will never have the time or patience to sit and spend hours reading about the mathematics of diffusion (example). Some great, useful physiology textbooks are ""Principles of Physiology"" by Berne and Levy (the thinner paperback) and Guyton & Hall as a reference book. Don't waste your time with the Johnson."
5,My toddler loves it,He just keeps on watching it over and over again and doesnt seem to get tired of this video. It keeps him enetrtained.
5,Hero of the Rails,"This is the first Thomas and Friends movie we purchased. My 2yr olds love watching ""thomas movie"" repeatedly when we let them."
5,He was happy with the DVD,Came on time and in it's original package - my son was really happy and keeps watching it every moment he gets
5,"Another great ""Thomas"" story.","Another big hit with our 3 1/2 year old son. Great story of the lost engine ""Hiro"" found by Thomas and brought back to his former glory as ""Master of the Railway."" Our son quotes the script exactly. The animation on these films is fantastic, great attention is paid to the minutest detail, even in the smallest area of background.You get great value with these ""Thomas and Friends"" movies and we highly recommend them for great story telling (teaching good values) for children, and quality animation!"
4,A very watchable and good Thomas movie,"We've had to watch ti about 3 times since Christmas already, it is a great little movie. My son loves Hiro."
4,3 1/2 year old loves it.,"My 3 1/2 year old loves Thomas and has many trains, and has watched the show for a year. He loved this DVD and watches it over and over and sings the Go Go Thomas song all over the house and in the grocery store with no shame. He calls this the ""Talking Thomas DVD "" and prefers these now over the older shows. It helped us that he had the trains that are also in the video. Makes it more fun for him as he plays with the trains and acts out the scenes on his train table."
4,Another Thomas!,"My son doesn't really ask to watch any particular Thomas Dvd,even after getting this one for him. He loves it when I put it in,but they all seem the same. There is a part that is ""cartoonish"" in it and I felt that was cute and made this a movie,as it states. I do enjoy watching them with him!"
5,Good Story,"I like this Thomas movie, it is one long movie not a collection of multiple Thomas stories and there is no annoying interruptions with people narrating.It has a nice story line and my sons watches it over and over."
4,NICELY DONE!!,"I agree totally with the other 2 reviews I read.. one of the reviews said:""There were no grating characters or voices"".. I couldn't agree more.. they should have just had one great voice do all the engines b/c there was no variety?Also I was not sure about the full animation either.. but stellar!!Hiro and the story is great, and yes they hit on teamwork, but so does every episode!!I so want to give it 5 stars but can't.. it just didn't blow my mind.. but it was great and you kids will adore it :)"
3,Emily,"Don't buy this video if you hate having to watch 10 minutes of commercials every time you watch the video. The movie is ok, my son seems to like it, but I prefer the older model Thomas videos."
1,A Disgrace to Thomas Legacy,"Adding CG effects to make the characters faces move kills the general idea of the magic that this series is supposed to bring. The new voices for the characters are awful, and the narrator gets on my nerves quickly. Whoever took over the Thomas series needs to make it the way it was in the beginning. Having Ringo Starr narrate, not hiring voice actors for the engines, and adding more action and thrills to the show. They should not be afraid to show some dark situations in Thomas. The original British Thomas children books had some dark situations in it and it sold extraordinarily well. The series has turned into a disgrace."
5,A Thomas Movie that Won't Make Adults Go Insane,My daughter loves Thomas the Tank Engine but sometimes the videos make me want to eat nails. That stupid song gets caught in my head and the stories just seem so short and underdeveloped. This movie is very different. The music is more modern (read: no annoying children's choir)and the character voices are much more natural. The longer story was developed well and did not seem to end abruptly. I actually enjoyed watching this Thomas video with my daughter.
4,Not bad for the new wave of Thomas,"This new Thomas and Friends movies uses more animation than the old TV series, typical of recent Thomas stories available on video. I'm not in favor of the animated facial expressions and speech, nor the fully animated Topham Hat. However the story in this particular full length movie was much better than previous Thomas movies or episodes. My 3 year old was not overwhelmed or confused by it, and we all really liked the new character, a Japanese engine called Hiro. The story was well-written, and except for the open ended fairy tale ending - it reaches a reasonable conclusion. The movie also used one of the better voice narrators, though not for all the character voices.I recommend it and hope you can get a good deal on it."
1,Very poorly written.,"Grad student here. Solid state is the one subject I really didn't know much about so I decided to take an intro class for it that used Kittel. I have not finished it nor will I probably; I checked out some other references from the library but most other authors even use a different outline for the course so I'm forced to look back at Kittel. I am not afraid to tackle a complex subject but my experience so far with this book has been confusion and frustration: the author uses terminology without explaining it, talks about new concepts without any sort of introduction. At many points in the reading you'll find yourself wondering what is going on.My worst experience with a textbook in my entire education. There is a book by Burns that's been tremendously helpful. Ashcroft & Mermin seem adequate as well."
3,Littered with Inconsistencies,"It is my firm belief that this book - now on it's 8th edition - is running on the steam of the first 3. There are many notation inconsistencies between the chapters, examples, and problem sets, as well as errors in the solutions manual. Unfortunately, if your professor requires this textbook, you must get it. However if you are reading on your own initiative, I would highly recommend Omar'sElementary Solid State Physics: Principles and Applications(as expensive as it is)."
1,Why is this the standard introductory textbook?,"Simply put, a terrible book. Kittel rarely discusses the physics behind any phenomena; he simply writes equations and expects the reader to understand what they mean. The fact that this is the ""standard"" intro solid-state physics book is pathetic. Please, if you are creating your own course, do not force students to suffer through this ungainly book..."
3,Its intended for a graduate course.,Prepare to do a lot of research in parallel with this book. The homework problems could be used to write another book on them selves. Very hard and makes the habit of skipping quite a few steps in proofs. But it covers a lot of material so it's only fair to say that its the best book out there for a undergraduate course and/or graduate course in solid state physics.
2,comprehensive but not well explained,It covers more stuff than the other books I read. But there are too many conclusions without clear explanations. It's not a good book for the newcomers in this field. It's tough to read. It may help you get something new if you've already studied SS. I think Ashcroft&Mermin and Ibach&Luth's books are much much better.
1,"Poorly written, lack of examples","Well, the negative reviews were correct. My solid state course has, unfortunately, decided to go with the Kittel 'standard' text, 8th edition. This book is difficult to learn from - largely because there is a severe shortage of quality examples and the material is not well explained throughout.If you also are forced to use this text for a course, I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing supplement texts:1. Solid State Theory, Walter A. Harrison (1979) - one of the best2. Elementary Solid State Physics, M. Ali Omar (1999) - also good3. Solid State Physics, Ashcroft/Mermin (1976/2003) - good"
3,This is not an introductory book,"This book cannot be used to learn solid state physics. Kittel has a problem with leaving out large portions of derivations. It seems that with each successive edition he removes essential details in return for covering new science. There is also a problem with Kittel's use of terminology. He uses the term lattice to refer to bravais lattices. It is a small but confusing distinction. This is not a good introductory book, though it is quite useful as a reference material after you have some background in solid state physics."
2,Not an Introductory Text!,"Overall I wouldn't recommend buying this book at all.However, you should especially dread buying it if this isyour first course in Solid State Physics.The book is rather disorganized andthe author is not writing in a very pedagogical style,I have no idea why this text is so popularand how it got to its 7th edition."
2,Be careful,This is not a book for study by yourself. Contents are physically and mathematically exact and precise. But the auther is such a person who doesn't like to spend time for minute explanation. This book is useful only when you are taking lecture of solid state physics and you have a teacher who can answer your questions.There are plenty of books better for study on your own.
1,"Terrible Writing, Written to Memorize Facts and Not understand","This is a pathetic textbook. The writing in it is awful, and sadly contributes to the stereotype that scientists do not know how to write. It is foolish to always give conclusions before derivations. It gives no motivation whatsoever for approaching certain questions nor the methods in which they are approached. It moves in a very inconsistent manner, developing topics very much at random, most annoyingly fading in and out of discussion of electronic models (Drude, Sommerfeld, Boch, weak periodic, etc). These models are at the core of the development of the field, and Kittel just kind of weaves in and out of random topics without bothering to explain why to describe things in such a manner (no discussion of why phonons are a good way to discuss system, no discussion of why we should obsess over k-space to describe every problem). Ashcroft and Mermin, by comparison, is a fantastic textbook which I highly recommend."
4,To be read together with Ashcroft and Mermin,"This book has been compared so much with A&M; that I have a suggestion - read both together! There are some parts in Kittel where a better treatment can be found in A&M;, such as the treatment on Bravais lattice. And A&M; goes into greater detail into some topics such as the Drude and Sommerfeld theory of metals. But I feel that there are many areas where Kittel is superior simply because the notation is simpler and the treatment more concise. See, for instance, the material on the empty lattice approximation and energy bands. Kittel is also more updated, and the 8th edition includes a chapter on nanostructures written by Paul McEuen.Kittel is not a perfect book, but neither is A&M.; The two, however, seem to complement each other. There are many instances when I come across something I do not understand, and I find it explained better in the other book. So if you have the time (and money!), read both!"
2,This is THE classic text in Solid State!,"I've taken solid state as an undergrad physics student, a grad at CSUF, a grad at University of Denver, and again as a grad at University of Washington. I have figured out why I just don't seem to grasp Solid State; I've always used this book! ;-) (Different editions) My prof agrees, there are better books out there.IMHO, the presentation is choppy and not coherant. Concepts are just thrown out and the student is left wondering, ""What was THAT all about?!"" It makes a GREAT reference if you already know solid state. I think thatis why it is used so often."
3,"Not good, not bad","it is a classical book, I think its good for theory but I prefer a book which explain with more detail calculations in order to understand.So if you want to understand from the beginning you should try with more pedagogical books , with more examples of better quality. If you are an advanced student maybe this is the book for you. In conclusion it is an intermediate book."
1,Introduction to Hell,This book is terrible. It is pedantic in parts handwaving in others. I recommend you drop the class you are buying it for.
2,Generations of solid state students suffered,"Generations of solid state physics students, including myself, have been brought up using this text by Kittel. I have also taught from this text numerous times. Poor, poor students! The text ""contains"" all the requisite material, but its explanations are murky and it it slips major concepts by without making them clear. I have resolved never again to make my students suffer with this text. Ashcroft & Mermin is wonderful book, but too advance as an introductory text. Bube's little book, Electrons in Solids, is a delight but too expensive for students and a little bit too elementary. Despite their limitations, I'm going to use the combination of those from now on."
1,this is a book for people who are experts,"If you are a beginner, this book does not help with setting the right background and relevancy."
2,"A bad book, don't buy.","I don't know why this book could possibly last to its 7th edition. It's a pain to understand its approach of some topics. In the 7th edition, the page number in the index doesn't match with the real page, which indicates the author and the publisher is so careless. Although the book is not short of tables and graphs, but the word part is just so bad. I know it's hard to find a good SSP book, but so far, Ashcroft and Mermin's is the best."
1,Horrible and Incomprehensible,"This book does not, in any stretch of the imagination, deserve to be the ""standard text."" Utterly incapable of educating willing subjects."
3,Dont attempt to read it without proper background,"I wanted to plunge directly to learn solid state physics and i bought the most widely used book in town. But that was a big mistake since I did not have a good background in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. My personal opinion is you must know classical mechanics, quantum mechanics and electrodynamics in and out before attempting to understand solid state physics since its a complicated web woven with all these ideas. Though i did not benefit much from the book, I don't want to bias other people from buying it. Give it a reading first and buy only if u like it"
2,Not very great book.,The first couple chapter is fine. Generally it includes a lot of useless details. Not really concentrates on important aspects (for electrical engineers). I think the Pierret book is much better.
2,A useless book.,"If you are new to the subject of Solid State Physics, this is just the worst book you can imagine. Wanna learn SSP? Use Ashcroft & Mermin. Don't wanna learn SSP? Use Kittel."
2,"Penguins ""flee""?!? a review of ""Puffins Climb, Penguins Rhyme""","I happen to be a fan of Puffins and Penguins, but I still can't recommend this book except as a ""Library Find.""My first complaint with it is the unexciting text**:Puffins glare,Penguins stareAnd second, I thought the pictures were not all that engaging. Particularly the Penguins, who came across as crabby and ill-tempered.**Other combinations of rhyme are clean/preen, hide/glide, see/flee. It didn't appeal much to me and the my home-audience just wandered on after a brief look-see.Considerations:::I've investigated and found different age recommendations for this book--everything from Preschool to 5th grade. Personally I would go with the younger ranges. While the Accelerated Reading level for the book is a generic ""2"", there isn't really enough text to be worth reading for older children.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksforKids-reviews"

2,"Good intent, but hidden affirmations","I've bought and listened to many of Eldon Taylor's subliminal tapes, including this one, and only after having read two of his books did I learn of the hidden list of messages that are included in all of his programs. ""Mommy and I are one"", and ""It's OK to do better than Daddy"" are supposed to offer a ""oneness fantasy"" for the listener. Once I learned of these and other hidden affirmations I decided not to listen again and have thrown out my collection of Dr. Taylor's tapes."

5,Very Good Choice!!! gran Elección!!!,"Es muy buena elección para empezar a conocer el trabajo de esta gran banda nordica. Esta bien hecha la recopilación ya que cuenta con grandes canciones, destacando como siempre ""San Sebastian"" y la de ""El Lobo y el Cuervo"" (Wolf & Raven), así como ""El Secreto de Victoria"" (Victoria's Secret)y la gran balada de ""Tallulah"". El disco contiene 17 canciones llenas de puro poder metálico."
1,unhappy,"purchased this CD twice and neither one worked, I was looking forward to listening to this great music,however I do not recommend this purchase"
4,Enjoyable Reading,Jan Burke is an exceptionally good mystery writer. This is the second time that I read Liar and still found it enjoyable. The book kept you guessing which is essential in a good mystery. I read this book when it was brand new and found on the second reading that the family history was drawn out more than needed and sometimes got confusing. All in all it was well worth reading.
3,In agreement with others...,"I stumbled across the first Irene Kelly novel, Goodnight Irene, a little less than a month ago and have flown through the rest of her books. I thoroughly enjoy them. HOWEVER, I have to agree with most of the other ""critics"" on this page and say there are too many characters to keep straight. I find myself having to flip back and forth to clarify storylines. I would like to note, for those who are considering reading these books, this is a series that is better read in order, than picking up in the middle."
2,too long - too confusing,"While I read Goodnight Irene and enjoyed it, this novel was just a little too long and just a little too confusing. There were too many characters. I had trouble keeping track of brothers, in-laws, nephews, etc. I found myself trying to finish this book as a pain, not a pleasure. I think I will read the next ""Bones"", hoping that Burke has tightened up her act a little. Don't give me 400 pages when 350 would do just as well. Karen Kirsch - Novi, MI"
4,Another Burke homerun,I just found Jan Burke as an author.........I think I have read all her books now. An amazing author. This one ranks right up there with the rest.
2,"Great for historical context, but not exactly listenable","Although I give this only 2 stars, I am happy to have this disc in my collection. For me, the music is a taste of the roots of funk. A few consecutive tracks are enough to render the sparse instrumentation and limited recording quality kind of grating. Mix some of these tunes into homemade compilations for great seasoning and counterpoint. It might also be a source for unique samples."
5,Respeto y aliento,Jamás pensé que un ligro como éste puedise despertar tanto odio hacia los hombres y sus leyes ridículas en las que la mujer es menos que un animal cuando es ésta mujer la que te trae al mundo con dolor y angustias.

4,1953?,"Great music - no doubt. The album is on a level with the famous Previn Trio series of albums recorded by Contemporary. What I strongly doubt, however, is the purported release date (1953). Apart from a couple of odd exceptions that have a history of their own, no stereo recordings had been made (or published, at least) up to that time. I don't know about the technical facilities used by the ""Tops"" label, but I do know that the pioneering (and still stunning) Contemporary recordings were not done in stereo before 1956, a time when most of the major labels were still reluctant to embark on the new technology.That said, I would still place these tracks among the better achievements of nineteen-fifties' jazz."
2,Don't get what you see!,The picture shown is for a USB card with a dongle but that is not what you get. It is a standard CardBus to USB2.0 adapter with the connectors fixed on the end of the card. This is a Amazon issue I have run into in the past where the add showed a 7.1 version of software but the actual store only carried version 7.0. If you look closely you can see that the card pictured is for a Mac but what you get is the IBM compatible version.(no dongle)
3,Good for meditation on the Passion,"Meditation on the Passion of Jesus Christ is an aspect of day-to-day Christian living that has been recommended by almost every 'big name' in every Christian tradition, from John Owen to Teresa of Avila. What Holloway offers in this handy little book is plenty of food for thought on this most sacred and mysterious of topics. He deftly cuts through to the humanity of all involved and so makes it highly relevant for the modern Christian. I would also recommend this book for those outside of or on the fringes of Christianity who are trying to understand this central aspect of Christianity."
4,311...really 4.5 out of 5,"this new cd from 311 is not perfect but is worth the 4.5 stars i gave it. The reason is because the way the two singers blend together in harmony is perfect. When you first listen to dont tread on me(the song), it more rock then turns into a little bit of reggae then when the other singer (sa) comes in it just makes the song so incredible. And taht works on throughtout the cd... overall good but not the old 311 we all know. Favortite Tracks Frolic Room, Dont Tread On Me, Whiskey And Whine, Speak Easy, Solar Flare"
5,Just fantastic,Once again 311 has been able to combine their reggae vs rock feel in an album. Good for sitting back and smoking. It is also a GREAT work-out album. It just keeps you going and going and going...
4,New to 311 for the most part.,"I heard there breakthrough self-titled album (1995) and it sounded sort of mundane except for a couple of songs; then mtv stop showing there videos so I never got a preview of there current album. Now I've been listening to modern rock radio a lot more and heard the title track and it grew on me. So I bought the album and like it a lot. They sound pretty much the same except the rapper guy (forget his name at the moment) does more singing it seems and it improves there overall sound for me. including a song that guy wrote (track 8) along with the title track and the heavy track 5, make up my 3 best for this record. They must have just formulated it write for this record. I'm gonna re-listen to there back catalouge.4 stars."
5,"311 - Different, But Good Different","I was suprised to hear SA breaking into lead vocals in this CD.I do enjoy the chill out 311 sound they have developed.A lot of fans have to understand, bands mature as do people.311's sound now is complimenting their 15 years in the business.I've been a fan since 95, religiously.I don't have bad things to say about SA singing more, but I do think there were times on the CD that Nick probably would have been a better choice. But I'm not the one who made the CD so I take it for what it is and enjoy it!I would have liked a couple more tracks. I have a song called ""Wandering Around"" and I wonder why this song didn't make the CD. It is one of my favorites!311 is still the one and only!"
5,5 stars for 311!!!,"It seems that people have mixed feelings about this album. To me, 311 continues to produce great uplifting tunes, as they have done all along. No other band can even compare. Some people claim to be ""real"" 311 fans and only like this album or that. I love ALL of 311's work. And I feel that they are far more talented than any other band currently creating new music. And I think it's great that SA has come into is own as a vocalist. He sounds awesome! I highly reccomend 'Don't Tread On Me', as well as all of 311's past work. And I look foward to future releases."
2,"In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone!","For the record: 311's major label debut album was Music(their best work I think) released in 1993, not the self titled, ""blue album"", released in 1995. I've read a few reviews that state the ""blue album"" is their debut. Now I don't understand how someone can accurately review someone's new album without being famailar with all of their releases. That being said, I am familiar with all of their releases and DTOM is not a good album. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of their last album, Evolver, but I liked it and was impressed with the direction with which they were going with their sound, and was hoping to hear that sound blossom on this album. That was not the case. Instead they fell short of what they are capable of, and I am surprised that they were comfortable releasing these songs. I've been a 311 fan since Music and this album is a major dip in their career. That's all I have to say."
4,311 takes a slight turn,"First of all, they aren't putting out 20 song albums anymore, for better or worse. This CD is more reggae/jazz and less rock/hip-hop than most 311 albums. Reinforcing that fact is Chad Sexton didn't write as many songs this time (and don't get me wrong, he's written some of the band's best work). This is a mature band winding up the end of their careers possibly.I like the slight shift in gears, and SA stands out in this release. Hexum has polished his vocals as well. All in all, if you're the type of fan that listens through entire 311 albums, you'll probably like this. It doesn't exactly have a lot of radio hits. Standouts include the tracks ""Speak Easy"" and ""Frolic Room.""I usually don't respond to other reviewers, but seriously man, Incubus, Korn, and Sugar Ray aren't like 311. They aren't even in the same ballpark. Sugar Ray sucks, and so does Stinkubas. 311 are innovators; no other band is really like them."
3,A slope from good to horrible,"I really am disappointed with this cd, but i was almost expecting it... It starts out strong with their great single ""Don't tread on me"", it stays listenable and pretty good until it gets to solar flare. the rest of the cd doesn't make it past 1/5 stars on my wmp10. Overall, the backup vocals are very sketchy on the majority of this cd and sort of disconnected. It's especially evident in ""thank your lucky stars"". It reminds me of how rough the killers sound in Mr. Brightside. Anyone with an ear and basic mixing/editing experience will bleed from the ears and wonder why this made it to a final cut and alas this cd I am now hearing."
2,Don't let me down...,"Why, I certainly feel let down. I am definitely a die hard 311 fan.Their creativity on the first 4 albums (ie from Music to Transistor) blew my mind. Songs like ""8:16 am"" have a strong, almost magical undertow - even if i listen to them for the 518th time. Having said that, I want to state that DTOM is an ok POPRecord. To put it in a polite way: That's not a terrible lot if you take into consideration that we are talking about 5 excepitonally giftet musicians/songwriters/producers.So for the next release: Don't let me down again!(Please.)"
1,Girl Band? Please read on!,"This is the biggest piece of garbage 311 has ever recorded. For those who followed them before the ""blue"" album will be sorely disappointed. They have gotten progressively worse and soft with every album. This is the most feminine to date. They should have released it under the name, Nick Hexum and the Skirts. Even the one track that rocks is ruined by a sappy chorus. If anything, this cd will make a great coaster! It's no surprise that the album came out 3 days ago and their is already 34 used copies up for sale. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's their best work to date. Maybe I'll get pixie dust sprinkled on me tonight and I'll wake up yearning to hear this fairy music."
1,Total Crap,"311 pioneered the 'rap-rock' era. Not that I miss that or anything, but what the hell happened? The first single, 'Don't Tread on Me', seemed like vintage 311. Now what? 'Whiskey and Wine'? Pure, total crap. I've been a 311 fan for over ten years, bought every album since 'Transistor' on the release day, and I can't stand to even listen to this crap. 'Evolver', their last album, was a masterpiece- 'Don't Tread on Me' is their low point. Enough said."
1,Worst album ever,"Seriously, it sounds like they took the worst songs from previous albums and put them all together."
2,man what happened?,"true die hards will be dissapointed! not what i expected by a superior group.. the chorus on some songs sound like bubble gum punk.. ya know.. blink182.. sum41.. that stuff.. that song waiting, it had to be a mistake. 311 has sooo much talent, why such a lame album?..update... after listening to this album like 40 times and forcing myself to like it, it still blows! perfect for mainstream, but when have they ever been mainstream? oh yeah.. the blue album, almost forgot"
3,A Slight Miss,"311's news release ""Don't Tread On Me"" is a slight miss compared to all of their other releases. The album is not like the rest of the 311 albums, in which you can listen to them non-stop. This album I loved at first, and continued to listen to it for 2 weeks straight, but by the end of the 2 weeks I was sick of the songs. This has never happened to me with a 311 album. The first single ""Don't Tread On Me"" is a bad single to put out, and by far the worst song on the album. There are many slow songs, and only one or 2 ""classic"" hard-rock 311 sounding songs. The highlights of the album are ""Thank Your Lucky Stars,"" ""Solar Flare,"" ""Getting Through To Her,"" and ""Whiskey & Wine."" 311 still possesses the ability to create an unbelievable melody, great guitar sound, amazing bass riffs, and killer drum beats, but these songs will not stand the test of time like their other songs do."
4,Just Give It A Chance!,"Okay, the first time I listened to it I hated it. I was extremely disappointed and confused. Then I remembered that most of the music I really like I didn't like the first time I heard it. So I gave it another chance. I liked it a little more but I still wasn't too thrilled with it. I kept listening to it over and over again. And now I loved it. I will admit it's not half as good as most of their other albums but it is still a good quality cd. I think it just takes a while to understand the tempo and the lyrics. I'm still just understanding some of the metaphors. I have been a 311 fan since I was about 11. I'm 21 now so I would like to think I know what I'm talking about. Hopefully you agree with me. Peace out!"
3,311 kicks ass....except for like 1 or 2 things that suck,"i love the new tunes, but for the most part the album as a whole to me seems a tad short. i wish they put a few extra tracks on it or lengthened some of the shorter ones to give the album a more complete feel like previous albums. other than that, there are only 1 or 2 songs i dont care for and it is overall a pretty solid piece of 311 history to add to my collection. i cant wait to see them tomorrow in NJ, where they will rip it up once again."
5,"New direction, same 311.","True fans of 311 realize that with every new album they produce, there's going to be nuances. This album has charisma; it ties together most elements from the previous albums and hits you with new sounds. There's a theme in DTOM, a calypso inspired melodic groove that's not yet been touched as it has in this album. Also, there's a song or two which is reminiscent of 80's metal, classic 311. The album ties together the sounds of grassroots, omaha sessions, transistor and evolver, with a hint of blue. I strongly recommend this album, especially if you fancy grassroots. Although eleven tracks is somewhat skimpy, i'm sure there will be 3 or 4 for the next b-sides disc. Three eleven has never failed to impress. This album, like all albums that really stick, takes a few listens to sink in; but when it does, you'll be glad you heard it out."
4,"can't complain, these guys rock","upon first hearing this album, i was a bit disappointed. I'm a big fan of 311's earlier sounds (early albums up to Transistor). After going through the album more and more, i realized that the music still kept the same soul and taste of mellow 311, just with a touch of their modern-developed sound. Overall, this album displays their mellow song-writing at its best, but contains none of the reggae/funk/metal from their older albums. every 311 fan should get it, and if you're a casual listener looking for something to jam to, this is great too. i'm still waiting for them to release an album in the same grade as Grassroots and Music."
1,I'm almost speechless..,"This album is an absolute disaster..an embarrassing turd that 311 tried to pass off as genuine with the hopes that their devoted fans wouldn't think it was disgusting. Well it is and 311 has obviously become lazy sell outs since the release of Soundsystem. One word sums it up: ""Waiting."" Are you kidding me?? This album is such a joke it should be listed under the comedy section. It's so disappointing to see a band who gave us classics like Music, Grassroots, the blue album and Transistor devolve into this mindless pop drivel and lame contrived fake melodies. It's mind boggling what happened to these guys and as far as I'm concerned 311 ended their studio careers in 1999..that last four albums have gotten progressively worse and should be stricken from the record. Don't waste your money this album is a complete and utter disgrace."
4,311 Don't Tread On Me.....A++++ !!!!!,If you'd like a funk infused rock album with a bit of Ska then You'll love this album from 311...this is soon to become a classic from 311....a Great band who's underrated and soon to make a HUGE breakout on the music world....check out all their other albums!
4,Not the best but definately not bad,This is definately not the best CD 311 has ever produced. But it does have a style all of it's own and I find it appealing. These kids saying they speak for everyone over 21. GO BLOW SMOKE OUT YOUR ARSE!! You can't talk for anyone but yourself. As for me I find there music original as always. I will admit there are some parts in the music wheres SA's flows don't stick all that well but thats part of music not everything has to be perfection. It's the small flaws or certain things band do to make them who they are. So all in all the CD is good. Not phenominal but not bad.
1,horrible what happened,ok what the hell happened to 311 they were such a great band i've seen them 18 times in 5 different states and this album sucked. when i put it in i thought i bought the wrong cd. it took a whole 10 minutes of scaning thru songs before i took it out and through it out my car window case and all. and i hope no one finds it because i wouldn't wish it on no man.
1,Come Un-Original | zzzzzzzzzz,"The band waited over two years to deliver 37 total running minutes of pure mediocrity... What an absolute disappointment; a true bona fide disgrace to all the long time 311 fans.....and wtf is up with these feeble and infantile lyrics. A six year old could have produced more meaningful and deeper lyrical compositions. This holds true for the entire album -- This album should only be available as a free download, period...What a shame -- Another band who sold their sole to the almighty dollar! Pff."
2,they wont evolve but you might as well take them as they are * * 1/2 stars,"311 have now gave up trying anything new, since those atempts came off bland or unusual. And as they said here there going back to the usual. That said the album is entry point 311. But sadly too much of ska-raggae populates the new record in tracks like ""dont tread on me"" ""speak easy"" ""Waiting"" and ""whiskey and wine"" populate the record, and the punkier metal numbers are in short change. pretty underwhelming with biteless fuzzed out cky-esque riffs, and raggae style drumming, while the hooks try to surface in the punchy ""thank your lucky stars"". while not as flat as Evolver the band cant avoid there inevitable, theyre becoming lazy. As previous releases showcased that 311 have mad skmill and when they want to they can cook up quite a heated storm, but it seems that the energy has surely passed them by. with all the member now in there 30's it seemless like the ganja sound seems to be an aimless save haven."
4,"Clean, Precise, and to the point","311 has once again provided an entire album that true 311 fans can be proud of. Although the lighter cuts outweigh the rockers, the album keeps you interested. Speak Easy, It's Getting Ok Now, and Getting Through To Her are some of the best written songs from 311 in quite some time. SA has come to a whole new level of songwriting and singing rather than relying on incomprehensible raps. There is no doubt that the sound is similar to what you have been accustomed to since 1995's Blue Album. The change has come in the form of better songwriting and tighter live performances. Look for a record number of singles hitting the airwaves from this album compared to any other 311 offering."
2,Run away... fast,"I have listened extensively to every single one of 311's studio albums, and this one is just below par on almost every measure. 311 used to be cocky and clever, using their creativity to blend many styles of music in a most pleasing way. This album misses the mark, and painfully. It sounds forced and overly poppy (refer to their song ""Hive"": 'The day we turn to pop, the show will stop'), making it really hard to listen to. There are some gems... ""Waiting"" and ""Don't Tread on Me"" are the only ones though. I do not recommend this album if you want to keep your view of 311 and their albums uninjured."
4,Great CD,"This CD is a step up from Evolver, I think. Alot of great songs on it(although very few songs on the CD). There is only one flaw that I could find and that was the entire song of Waiting. It is just a song that I don't think that I will ever be able to grab ahold to. But, other than that, a great buy."
2,I dunno too poppy,"I personally didnt enjoy the new cd all too much. It's cool for everyone that likes ""love song"" and ""amber"" (which were good songs_, but this cd lacks the 311 energy..."
2,don't tread on this,"I'm a huge fan of 311 but this is clearly there worst record they have released. Even Nick Hexum recently admitted this and stated that he felt the album was rushed. The songs are too throw-away and lack the original riffing and riff changes that exists in almost all of their other releases. It sounds like a band that is tired. Look for Transistor, Evolver or Soundsystem for the real 311 masterpieces."
2,"Decent, But Awful By Comparison","Given the funky, reggae laiden rock that 311 is known for, this album is terribly bland and not creative at all.While still better than any ""rock"" album recently released, this album is a really watered down version of 311, where the rap influenced singing is replaced by some of the most feminine singing Nick has ever done.I'm a big 311 fan, but I will not pretend this album is good. I want my slap bass, my hip hop influenced drumming, funky guitars and fresh lyrics."
2,this is a joke,"I have been a fan of 311 for many years and I own all their albums. I was really excited for the release of this album. Let me tell ya, after getting home from the record store, I couldn't be any more excited to put this in my cd player. Boy was I disappointed. Every single track on the cd had that lazy-mediocre feel. I'm not saying the songs are bad, it's just that every single song was written very lazily and did not utilize the band's real talents. Songs like ""Getting Through To Her"" and ""Waiting"" just make me laugh cause they are cheesy beyond belief, I'm not even sure if the band wrote these songs seriously. I respect the band's desire to mature and evolve, but the way they are changing is not in a good direction (I speak on behalf of alot of loyal 311 fans). I love 311, but this album really got me down. I just hope they do a better job next time."
1,311 fails to generate even a listenable album,"""The day we turn to pop, the show will stop."" Anybody else remember that lyric from the group's Blue Album cult classic ""Hive""? I remember it, but I think Nick and gang have forgotten. My 311 listening begins with the Omaha Sessions and stops with From Chaos. Cancelling their annual 3-11 day show to produce what they called their best album generated high hopes that they might return to form and evolve their sound, as they hoped to do on their previous album, Evolver (also a dissapointment). However, this album sounds as if a cookie cutter no talent band of today melded with a reggae record, and the result is awful. If they were trying to appeal to Ashlee Simpson listeners my guess is they succeeded admirably. To anyone with actual musical ears, the album is far from satisfying."
4,It's not that bad,"I bought this CD after I heard 311's version of The Cure's ""Love Song,"" which was my first taste of 311. I gave it four stars because I haven't heard their other albums, and so I came in listening to it with no real expectations. I did think that the singing would be a little better, but overall, the CD is something I can listen to while driving or doing homework. It's pretty mellow. My personal favorites were Long For The Flowers, Getting Through To Her, and There's Always An Excuse. For those 311 fans who've listened to every album, they probably weren't able to take Don't Tread On Me for what it is. Comparatively speaking to other music that's out there, this CD really isn't that bad. It's not great, but I do listen to it pretty often, and I'd recommend it if you like easy going, island style music and have no expectations as to how this should sound."
4,not the 311 i know,"Speak Easy is really reggae up-beat song, I like it the best even though it doesnt sound like old 311 at all. Overall it's an satisfactory album, but its definately not like the 311 im familiar with. Music and Grassroots are the best ever!!"
3,Disappointed Fan,"I just picked up ""Don't Tread on Me"" and must say I'm truely disappointed. I read some reviews on here where people said they went back to the old school stuff like on Music. Don't believe those people. This sounds nothing like Music. Instead it sounds like a lame pop record. 311 has progressively sold out more on each album. Evolver was disappointing but there were still a few solid tracks. This album has no more than 2 decent tracks. ""Solar Flare"" starts off heavy but turns into a lame anti-war song with a soft chorus. If your favorite 311 albums are Music and Grassroots then don't buy this album. 311's music hasn't evolved, they've sold out. Why does every good band these days have to sell out? Lame!"
1,Boring Album from a Great Band,"I don't get it. 311 is a good band. So why is this album so terrible? This album is just so boring. Most of the tracks have this real 'island' feel to them - like I'd expect to hear these songs broadcast from the hotel while vacationing in the Bahamas. Not what I want to hear. Anyway, I bought this album based on their previous efforts, and I am horribly disappointed. If you like 311, stick with their debut album from 1995 or their Evolver album from a few years ago. Stay away from this album."
4,Great Album from a Great Band,"311 has had ups and downs making records and even though this album doesnt blow me away like Transistor or Evolver did, its still a great album. Theres less of a rap type feel on this album and more of a regee, soul feel. This album starts off with the reggae focused song ''Dont Tread On Me''. This song is classic 311, and it features great vocals by Nick and SA. Followed by this song is ''Thank Your Lucky Stars'' which is a more rockier, rappier feel like diehard 311 fans are acustomed too. The 3rd track ''Frolic Room'' is probly my favorate song on this album with a less rock and rap feel but its still awesome.Other standout tracks are ''Solar Flare''which is probly one of the dopest songs 3211 has done, ''Its Getting Ok Now'' is another great melodic song by SA. its a great song as well.4/5"
3,It's alright,"I'm friends with a lot of 311 fans, and I think we've all accepted that new 311 records aren't going to be the same as their old stuff. That said, I like this CD a little more than Evolver, which was my least favorite 311 album. I enjoyed listening to it... Waiting is my personal favorite, and Don't Tread on Me is good, but you've probably heard it already. I just can't give it more than a 3 because it doesn't have the sound that defines what I like about 311. Listen to a few tracks on the 311 website and you'll get the main idea of what the album sounds like. Final words on the album... if you have the rest of the albums, get this one. If you are a new listener of 311, listen to all of the older stuff, minus Evolver, before you get this."
2,What happened?,"I love 311. They are and always will be one of my favorite bands, but this album well....sucked. Yes I said it. It sucks and I will tell you why. I enjoyed their previous albums because I felt the music. I felt depth in the tunes. What I heard on this album was a sell out, soft porn approach to making music except for a few songs. Sure you might attract every 14 year old girl on the block, but do you really want to go from a strong soulful message with your own sound to sounding like your an opening band from a Brittney Spears concert? A lot of these songs remind me of music I would hear on a kids show. Cheesy"
5,Amazing,"Most artists who compose an awesome album usually can only do it once. 311 has never ceased to amaze us. ""Don't Tread On Me"" is yet another one of their releases that will blow your mind. The songs have their usual fun lyrics and the music rocks...way hard! This cd is definitely worth adding to your collection. Awesome! Go buy it!!"
5,Very comprehensive and well illustrated guidebook,"This is so far the most comprehensive and indispensable pocket guidebook I have ever seen for auto travelers when touring in Britain. The book is filled with road maps and well illustrated with full colour pictures showing a thousand B&B residences for selection. In one word, you may visualize the B&B residences with facilities introduction before making up your mind to go for it. Of course, detailed facts such as rates and amenities are updated as well."
5,Highly recommended,"While using this video and workbook to train new group psychotherapists, I found the Corey's material to be one of the best available. My students were moved by the authenticity and genuineness of the actual work being done by the participants. This is in contrast to other training videos which use students doing role plays, and tend to be stilted in dialogue and boring in content. The workbook adds relevant exercises and commentary, which though tedious to complete, serve to give the students new perspectives and insight on the ways to be more effective when in the role of psychotherapist. Highly recommended."
4,"great video, fair workbook","I had to order this and was not looking forward to it--the video is very well done and believable. The facilitators (Corey's) are wonderful and their style helpful. The workbook is easy enough to complete, it is at times, monotonous and redundant. It is very easy to follow as they use number cues to stop/start. If you have never been in a therapy group you need to see this as it is very accurate."
4,Excellant Video,"A portion of this video was shown in my group counseling class. I opted to watch the entire video and I am very glad I did. It gives you good examples of the dynamics that can occur in a group counseling session. You get to watch a group evolve over a 2-3 day period. I found it to be very helpful and think anyone, who has not experienced a group counseling session first hand, should watch it. The video was edited down so it would only be about 2 hours. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the work done with each individual. The workbook covers it, but a picture is definitely worth a 1000 words. I think that would have made the video even more valuable."
2,Evolution of a group workbook,"I didn't realize that this book required a CD, which was not included in my purchase. Do not order this book if it does not have the CD included; it's worthless."
3,Underwhelmed,I use this every once in a while and I'm not sure that it really does anything other than make your forehead shinier. I think I would suggest instead of using this product for you to just drink a lot of water and keep yourself hydrated.
3,can not keep water of skin well,"I use this cream to my face on the morning, and about after 3hours, my face fells dry and white skin fragment appears."
2,Couldn't get past the smell,I bought this product because I didn't want to look like an old man. I stopped using this product because I didn't want to smell like an old man. I recommend using Neutrogena For Men Age FIghter Face Moisture ~1.4 Fl Oz instead.
2,Would not recommend,"Very sticky, face feels oily all the time after using this and it smells like a women's cream. I don't recommend this to anyone"
2,Smells like rusty metal?!,"Just got two bottles. Opened one of them, which smells like rusty metal, gosh! Not sure if the second one will be the same. But disappointed anyway."
3,"Fragrance doesn't make ""scents""","The product seems to work OK. Obviously, any moisturizer is helpful to aging facial and neck skin and I suppose this product is as good or better than many others. In order for it to actually penetrate the skin, your face must be not just clean, but abraded, so get a facial brush of some kind. On the down side, it has a strong, not very masculine fragrance. I could understand the developers at L'Oreal using this fragrance in a product marketed to over-sexed, insecure twenty something guys, but this is an anti-wrinkle and firming product meant for fifty and sixty year old men who have long ago decided what scent (if any) they wear, and at our age it's probably not this one!"
2,WARNING! no SPF,Warning!! mislead product detail says with sunscreen but it does not have any. i think they are confusing this with another L'oreal product...
2,Feedback,The product I received was not the product I ordered. The product is old and the quality is not what I am used to from L'Oreal. I have purchased a similar product (the one I actually ordered) at retail for a couple of years.
4,Good price for the quality,I've used several different lines of men's skin products and for the value I think L'Oreal is the winner. When people start mentioning how good your skin looks you know you're on to something good. I don't find it greasy at all and my skin absorbs it well. I also like their cleanser quite a bit but for an exfoliator I use Biotherme which I like. I may not look ten years younger but I look good for my age and that's a good thing!
4,Good Men's Moisturizer,"If your looking for a good product, with a medium masculine fraquence this is the product for you. It has a fragence, not overly manly, but not feminine. The Amazon descriptions above conflict themselves with wether or not SPF is in the product. I recommend the non-SPF product unless you spend a lot of time in the sun from 10-4, which I do not. Recent studies say too much SPF can deprive you of Vitamin D. So a little sun on the commute at 8am and 5pm isn't a concern for me. As well the SPF material irritate my eyes. I would not buy this if it had SPF. It takes very little product to cover my face, and the 1.6fl oz container lasted me 6 months. It took me a long time on Walgreens and Target to find a decent product that wasn't over-hyped and a recent visit to Walgreens showed the product was gone. So I am very happy to find it here, and hope it gets back in these stores. I have young childer, and those are the stores we frequent."
3,looks nice but cheap,Although I love the graphics the quality of the shirt was very cheap. I wish it was of a little heavier fabric!
4,"Great, but hardly ""complete""","I have to agree with a previous reviewer: the music is impeccable, but this is not all they produced together, and does not include their best session together, ""Body And Soul"" from 1973. Complete should be qualified if it isn't really complete, and ""original"" is a misleading qualifier. I know of at least three studio sessions of Zoot and Al that are not included. Having said all that, it's actually about the music, and the music is wonderful, both in the unison parts and in the soloing. Lively, swinging and consistently enjoyable. If you don't have it, this is as good a way to get it as any, and cheaper than most. But don't miss ""Body And Soul"", for my money their best effort together."
2,GRK HandyPak 100,"The product is great, but unfortunately the T-25 Bit that the website and the container label explicitly state is included was missing. It is disappointing that the seller chose to remove it. Now I have to spend the money to buy the bit, which by the way, is not cheap."
2,not as hot as original,"For years I had a melita 4 cup coffee maker and it was great with real hot coffed but I moved 3 times and it finally died. I tried to get another but they had discontinued the model. I have tried several others, mr. coffee etc. and they were ok but once you put milk in the coffee it was luke warm. I was excited to find another small melita. It is better then the others but it has some safety thing where the coffee stays hot buy not real hot and if you put in milk it is less hot. It is not as bad as luke warm but not much better. I am very disappointed."
2,Cheap and lousy.,Why Melitta would replace an excellent 4 cup maker that worked better (hotter coffee) and easier (the basket on this model is a pain) is hard to understand. I bought this one based on previous experience with the company and their reputation. Apparently neither means much.
2,What a disappointment,"Melitta ruined the perfect product with this model. I bought it because of my experience with their now discontinued 4-Cup brewer. The difference could not be more stark. It is well priced, more modern, features a detachable water tank, and easier to pour. However it brews a horribly luke warm cup of coffee. The only up side I can see to this aspect it that if you need to suck down a cup of coffee in 5-minutes or less, this is the coffee maker to get. The unit is a perfect example of form over function."
3,difficult to use,I have arthritis in my fingers and found the filter release tab very difficult to use.
3,Melitta 5 cup Non Digital Coffee Maker,I am using this now. I find it hard to remove the coffee pot from the base because of the stop and pour feature. It may be that it is just this particular unit.
4,Happy with purchase,"I wanted a small coffee maker and bought this one because one reviewer said it did not pour back. However, I found that if the pot is full and I am pouring fast, it does pour back. So I have to slow down and then there are no leaks. I like the separate tank with clear cup markings. I also thought ""removable filter basket"" meant ""reusable"", so that was disappointing. And the reusable gold filter I had with my previous coffee maker didn't quite fit in this basket, so now I have to buy paper filters. So it was not a 100% perfect solution, but I have gotten used to it and am very satisfied with this Melitta coffee maker now."
2,Leaks,"Makes good coffee, but the tank leaks :(And the carafe cracked on the bottom already; from the heat?Well the price was right--I paid < $7.00 for this, with free shipping. But really, it's not worth it. May be a disposable price, but I don't agree with a disposable coffee maker--it will fill up the landfills quickly."
5,Inspiring,"As a clinician, I have found Beyond the Lingo an excellent book for people who suffer from alcoholism or drug addiction, their families, and clinicians. Mr. Blackwood writes in an easy to read, understandable, logical, and intelligent manner providing inspirition to those who feel overwhelmed by the consequences of the disease. He provides practical information beginning with the meaning of addiction and its causes and consequences. He then explains the importance of the 12-steps in recovery, avoiding relapse, how to deal with relationships, cravings and how to stay motivated. A particularly helpful chapter is focused on HIV and AIDS. Finally, he ends with the importance of serenity, sprituality, and maintaining recovery. Well done and a must read."
1,Enjoy the album version (Nuff said),"I bought this because I remember my younger days when a remix was an actual different version (reworking) of a song I already loved. This is the case here, but Al B. messed this one up himself. The mixes are almost forgivable until he starts rapping or whatever the hell you want to call that. Yuk! Just Yuk! Unfortunately, his music was popular at a time when R&B was turning into hip-hop and everyone thought adding a rap added to the value of a song. This flawed way of thinking still affects music today, but as far as this particular maxi-single goes, it's a bust. I still enjoy Al B.'s music, but this one is not worth the $0.99, and definitely not worth the shipping costs added."
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love this CD. It's by far his best. TI sounds so great in it, I find myself getting the songs stuck in my head. It's defintely a hott album and i recommend you buying it, I promise you will not be dissapointed."
2,Clunky even in v2.0,"The manufacturer has since come out with a newer version ofthis product (version 2.0) but both versions are spotty andclunky. There are strengths to be sure, but it is hard torecommend this product. Permissions issues, installationdifficulties, problems in multiple user environments, youget the idea. Some of the problems are solved with the patchesavailable on their website, http://support.daemonnews.org/macoffice/- I have not tried version 2.5"
1,Talk about Theft.,"Wow, so this band couldnt even be original enough to think beyond a horror movie based on a much better short story by clive barker. This is a direct theft of not only Clive Barkers short story, but also a theft of the character from the tie in movie from the 1980's. Maybe you guys should actually think of something original and someone would buy your music. I pray to Baphomet that Clive Barker or the creators of the movie stumble upon this and sue you for all your unimaginative souls are worth."
5,LONG LOST TUNES. I'VE BEEN SINGING IN MY MIND...,"Man, i'm glad i found this gem, again. ""She said I hurt because of you, I'm a flower who needs light, take your darkness go away"". It looks pricey, i'm gonna shop around some but, if this is the price, i will pay it. This will stay in your mind forever."
2,Patriots Uniform set,It is a very nice set that comes with iron-on numbers for the back. I followed the directions but the numbers look LOUSY! I would not buy this set again. It needs the numbers on the back but with the numbers ironed on it looks really lousy.
3,a unique sound mix of early 80s electro mixed with poetry,"This album is hard to describe to someone who has never heard it before, however I would start with saying that it is basically early 80s electro/synth music with anne clark singing peotry like lyrics over the top. This may sound a strange mix, but listen to ""homecoming"" and I am sure you will agree that is works very well together. Similar in style to early 80s Depeche Mode or Front 242 musically, but with female talked vocals. Other top tracks are ""Up"" , ""Now"" and ""Leaving"". Worth a listen if you like 80s minimalist electro/synthpop."
4,OUR SEPARATION FROM NATURE MAY TAKE US WHERE ??,"This book of poems displays the roots of Hendricks' ""political satirist"" writings. His poems reflect a solid grounding in an awareness of the rhythms of the universe. A keen observer of the natural environment, he shows us how far humanity has strayed from its connection to the natural world that sustains us.His rational mind does not presume to prophesy, rather *project* where our separation from Nature may take us. While many of the poems may not be considered lyrical, his reading of those that are not, become so in the reading.Not all poets read their own work well. Anthony is one who reads his poems as he wishes them to be heard. It is a pity all readers of his poems cannot have a personal reading."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased two of this sweaters due to their excellent price. I am 6'2, 250 pounds and I usually wear XL, due to a prior experience with Adidas(they are smaller than other brands) I ordered a XXXL because they did not have XXL and to my surprise they are like a regular size medium, I had to give them to my wife. They look nice but their sizing its way off."
4,So fun!,"In a nutshell, my friends and I love love love this game. It is so much fun. My only qualifier is that this game is very simple. It shows pictures / movie clips / etc. and you have to make up the funniest lines to enhance them. In other words, the ""tools"" of the game are extremely simple and enjoyment of the game comes from having a funny / creative group. I'm surrounded by very funny people, which is why this is our favorite."
4,Not Bad,I boought this for my always skeptical youth group and they seemed to enjoy it ok once we got into it a few minutes. I would recomend this for anyone.
1,Bad,"Yeah this is just really bad.I have a lot of these DVD products. This one plays like Beyond Balderdash, which I love. This one is just missing something. And for what I paid for it, I was very disappointed. The concept is good, and the idea is funny, but the way they executed the game play it is completely dependent on the people you are playing with to make the game funny. Having said that I was playing with some very funny people, but it wasn't fun, so I guess even that doesn't work. Do yourself a favor; use the $30 bucks to buy three games of Shout! Or get TP Pop Culture2."
1,Don't buy Quip It!,This game is not very fun at all! If it were something like Scene It or something where you have to name the movie from watching a scene or hear a quote that would have been better.
1,looks good but doesn't perform,"i bought this for my 5 year old nephew and he was very excited. it was fairly easy to put together, though some joints were troublesome. the real problem was that the cars don't stay on the track. every turn, which is about every 5 seconds, is a disaster. either you slow the car almost to a stop or it just flies off. and this was me operating it, not the child, but we were both disappointed."
3,Monster Mess,"Great concept, poor execution. The track is not wide enough for easy passing without bumping. Cars are fast but track leaves much to be desired."
3,Check your horn size,"The case DOES NOT fit all cornets as stated. I highly suggest that you get measurements. Another critique... there is no room for music or for carrying your mutes. This was bought as a gift to a disappointed 13 year old when even the horn didn't fit... The case interior is nice, and has room for only one mouth piece."
5,Pegasus In Space,"This book picks up where Pegasus in Flight ends, with the addition of new psychics and old friends of Peter, who help him in unexpected and startling ways. Once I started reading the book I got to page 114 before tired eyes forced me to go to sleep. The following day I finished it, so gripped by it's action was I.I am looking forward to more sequals to it.All characters come alive right from page one. Joseph T. Gabus ham@morgan.net & Extra Class amateur radio operator AB5RE"
2,Potboiler,I'm afraid I found the book nothing but a potboiler. I re-read Pegasus in Flight once I'd finished it to see if it was my appreciation of Anne McCaffrey's books which had changed and the difference in the quality of the writing was very noticeable. If this had been my introduction to her as an author I would have been put off buying anymore
4,Coming of Age,"It had been a long time since I read the other ""Pegasus"" books, so I was happy to see that the story continues. Peter grows up, reaches his potential and holds on to his innocense. Oh if there were only real life!"
2,Too many typos and erros to enjoy the story.,"I am a big fan of Anne McCaffrey but this ebook is so loaded with typos and words that make no sense at all in the context of the sentence that it's almost painful to read! It's a shame that whoever created these ebooks didn't care enough to edit them as if they were print books.I've noticed this in a few other ebooks as well and although I was planning to purchase a Kindle Fire soon, if they're going to just put out poorly edited books to make a buck (several bucks actually) and hope that no one cares about the quality I'm probably going to skip the Kindle Fire, stop buying ebooks and go back to the real thing."
4,The Talents of Earth take a giant leap into space!,"I love Anne McCaffrey's books and her Pegasus series is one of my favorites.This book re-introduces us to some old friends and some new ones as well and starts immediately from the previous book, Pegasus in Flight.The action moves well and is easy to follow. This story mainly follows Peter Reidinger as he grows from an adolescent into a man and how he overcomes his disability to achieve his dreams.As usual, Anne McCaffrey has done a brillint job."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Anne MacCaffrey's books typically hit where the heart is, with excellent characterization that is often deeply touching. This book is entirely lacking that. Yes, it was good to revisit old friends, but when comparing this book to its predecessors, it seems almost not worth the read. Also, the information dumps were handled quite poorly, and I found myself skimming through them.In addition, an entire subplot seemed ridiculous after the motivation for it was revealed. All in all, this book was a major disappointment, and not up to Ms. MacCaffrey's usual standards."
2,Surprisingly a let down.,"I love the works of Anne McCaffrey and anxiously awaited the release of a new ""Pegasus"" book. The thing I love most about her works is the fact that you feel like you really KNOW the people she writes about. I feel this book was way to technical, very little about the lives of the people. Many times I found myself confused or bored during the discussion of how the gestalt worked etc... I cried like a baby when Masterharper Robinton died in the Dragonriders series but didn't even flinch when Dorotea had her stroke. It was like you already knew the outcome before you ever got there. All in all I am glad to have read the book and did enjoy it but I just didn't get the feel for it the way I normally do with her books."
2,not greatest book of hers,"this book came out the same time as the skies of pern and i felt that they were both rushed jobs. Pegasus in Space does close the Pegasus series and gives u the bridge to the Talent series, but it seems to be made of a list of facts then an actual story, there just dosent seem to be ne substance to it. And even though its ment to end a series the book dosent recap/flashback to hardly ne thing from the previous novels except by merly mentioning what happaned and i sometimes was a little lost because i hadnt read the other novels recently."
3,A Dissapointment,"While an adequate story for any other writer, I was expecting more from McCaffrey. The story seemed to move slow and I had a hard time getting through it. Usually, when I'm done reading one of her books, I'm disappointed that it's over. When I finished this one, I was glad it was over."
3,"Insightful and useful book, but lacks multi-cultural flavor.","Okuns's book provides a strong counseling model that practioners can follow. I found her exercises and examples particularly helpful and seemingly useful. However, her model is based on an affective,western;client-centered model. Many of the techniques suggested would be difficult to apply to clients of diverse populations. If you decide to buy this book, consider purchasing her other book, Understanding Diverse Families:What Practioners Need to Know."
2,Very used,Well it came but it was very used with a lot writing on the pages. It will make it work but will feel bad if i try to resell this book.
2,Not Good Product,Paper is cheap and the blue lines are very feint. Staples comparable notebook is superior in both respects. Don't buy this.
1,an overpriced item,"the notebook has poor quality, cheap thin paper. it 's not worth $2.51. How stupid I am."
4,Hard to Beat for the Price,"Yeah, it's a little thin and the covers don't give much writing support...but hey, what do you expect for only just over a buck including shipping? I wouldn't write an essay on it but it's great for non-profesional everyday use, like jotting down notes, making lists, rough drafts, doing the math on something, and a hundred other uses. Best deal on Amazon for a product of it's category!"
1,Poor quality,I ordered two notebooks and received one and a half. The half book has no front cover and is missing half the pages. The other notebook has ceases in half the books. Thin paper. Granted it might be cheaper but you get much better deal at other retail with back-to-school promotions.
3,Decent,"I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids. The pages are thin, they aren't perforated, but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks. My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge. It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then. They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.The pages are wide-ruled, good for elementary school kids. Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them."
3,Not what it used to be,Surprisingly poor quality of paper in these notebooks. Several pages were stuck at the spiral punches. Separating them individually works with some sheets and caused others to tear. Mead used to be a great product but I guess the quality of everything seems to be deteriorating these days.
1,Bad Buy,"This is not a good source for pictures. I have read the book numerous times, and tried every conceivable setting, to no avail. My pics are fuzzy beyond repair. I am now shopping for new camera before I lose more important memories of my kids.Video camera portion seems to function fine, although, it's a lot of money for just that piece."
5,Perfect for P90X2,"We purchased the 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb balls for use in P90X2. They are exactly what we needed for the program. The ball are of very high quality and look like the are basically going to last forever. I suggest that if you have 2 people doing to program together (as is our case) that you buy two of the same ball for each person. The 6 and 8 lb balls are close enough to the same size that they can be used together but the 4 is much smaller and the 10 is noticeably bigger (might be the same as the 12 though we don't have that one). Also, when doing push-ups on the balls the 6 lb will indent slightly (even for my wife who is very light) so it is probably best to get two 8 lb balls. These balls do come with a pin to inflate the ball which helps but still better to get the 8 lb ball, I think."
4,was delivered promptly,"Most of the places charged a lot for this ball to be delivered.Considering how heavy it is, rightfully so, but with amazon, they shipped it for free!Yes, it's just a heavy ball, but pretty amazing how it can be a workout."
2,"""Odd Ball""","The ball I received was warped and looked as though the seams were stretched and would burst at any given moment. This is a major flaw. This ball should never have made it past inspection and into the box for sale. It does, however, weigh 4 lbs, so they got that right."
2,8lb ball,"Overall a good med ball. I have the 8lb ball that my paddling team uses in workouts to strengthen the core.I would LOVE it if they made an 8lb ball like this in a slightly smaller size. It's obviously made for men's hands. A slightly smaller easier to grip version of the heavier balls would be wonderful for us ladies.Update..8/2012Well, the ball was good until it split open this morning while doing slams with it against the pavement. As a weird coincidence, another teammates medicine ball broke this morning too. Also a valeo.My next medicine ball will most likely be a Nike. Many people on my team have one, and have had no problems like that despite having the ball longer than I had mine. Oh well."
4,Great workout with this medicine ball,Sturdy construction and solid weight. I have had no issues with it at all.
5,Medicine Ball Review,Fast Delivery and excellent product. Exactly what I was looking for. Well constructed and at 12 pounds it is the right size to enhance my exercise routine.
3,Nice Quality,Have had it for over a year and have not had any problems. I wish I would have got a heavier one but this is nice to carry around the house over my head for 20 minutes to get a burn.
5,Just what I asked for,"Just what I expected and shipped quick! Easy packaging, nice quality, and good weight and size. Will be very durable."
4,"seems good, not used yet",Seems to be good quality and like that it comes with suggested exercises. Now we just need too find some free time to work out at home!
5,A Quality Sturdy Product,"With all the choices around I was afraid to order this online, but in the end I was happy with the purchase. It is a quality product that even holds up to my level of abuse."
2,"Lousy product, good customer service","Buyer beware! Possibly the worst medicine ball you could buy. We've gone through two in less than two months. The first ball we received lasted about 3 weeks and then during a routine workout the air valve blew-out. Thank God that Amazon customer service was a cinch! We were accommodated with a return authorization and shipping label and had a replacement ball super fast! We were stoked! We thought, for sure, that the first blow-out was a fluke. Until, about a week after we started using the second ball, the sidewall burst. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice.... that wont be happening. I'll take a refund and find a new medicine ball, thank you!"
4,Value purchase,"I found medicine balls to be a little too pricey for my taste when I decided to get one, so this value-priced VALEO medicine ball was a good buy. The tradeoffs compared to the more expensive ones I've used seem to be the smell (cheap rubber stink) and the surface coating / paint peeling off. If you're willing to deal with that you can't beat it. It isn't broken so far after a month of use and it still weighs 10lbs so what more can you ask for? It's added a nice dynamic to my workout as well. I'd buy another one."
3,Serves It's purpose,"My first complaint is the Rubber material that the ball is composed of has an awful odor, almost like fumes. Also other reviewers stated that the ball was easy to hold onto and that is not the case. Maybe if you have large hands. Better off using leather workout gloves to get a better grip.Cannot use it for certain exercises as instructed in some videos. Mainly holding the ball in between ankles because the ball is to hard. Better off researching the product by the exercise platform you want to follow and whether or not the soft or hard medicine ball will accomodate your needs. The soft ball was an option online, but I had originally purchased it in the store and twice their enclosed video did not work and they gave me a difficult time about returning them. I do use it because it serves it's purpose but in the future I would research the product thorougly to insure that it meets all my expectations or just go through the trouble of returning it when not completely satisfied."
4,good med ball,"Perfect size for an 8# med ball, nice grip. I haven't thrown it against anything but it looks like it will hold up well.Did not give it 5 stars for 2 reasons:1. Will not do exercises for me. ;-)2. Smell of ball (rubber). Diminishing now, but it has been over a month. How much longer before my hands don't smell of manufactured rubber?"
4,8lbs is heavy!,"This review may actually be extremely helpful to someone. I am a 155lb man. I work out on a regular basis but truthfully I'm a little on the weak side. Or maybe a lot on the week side. I wish I would have went for a four to six pound ball. Eight is way to much and it is taking a while for my body to get used to the weight. Medicine ball work outs are the best. I actually enjoy the medicine ball more than using free weights. You can work the entire body with some exercises. I feel like it improves flexibility drastically. But if you are under 165lbs you might want a lighter weight.One other gripe is that the ball, I believe, was made for bouncing. Which is good for some exercises but the exterior of this ball is like that of a basketball. This makes planking with the ball uncomfortable."
3,dont use this outside,i bought this medicine ball a couple years ago and it was served me well. the one thing is that i would not recommend using it outside. the rubber gets worn down really fast and the grip becomes nonexistent after a short time using it outside. i've since bought another nike medicine ball which has been more durable and lasted longer than this one did.
3,Made in China,"The ball is good quality and has a good grip, so it's quite usefull for medicine ball exercises. However, the ball is made in China and has a rubber, tire odor which I have not been able to get rid of. The company stated that the rubber has not been tested for any harmfull chemicals.They might want to do that."
2,disappointing surface grip. sturdy ball.,"A MUCH BETTER CHOICE WOULD BE ""SPORTS GEAR"" BRAND. (Sold only at Dicks Sporting Goods stores)...I bought one of these 10 pound medicine balls for P90X2 and also for my regular medicine ball cardio routine. It isn't too bad if all you plan on doing is pushups on top of this medicine ball; it is so sturdy my husband can even stand on it with both feet and balance without damaging the ball.HOWEVER if you ever plan on doing any cardio or plyometrics (jumping around) where you will be holding the ball and plan on sweating even the tiniest bit, this ball will seriously fly out of your hands if you are not careful. The grip is pretty much worthless.The ""Sports Gear"" brand is much better with amazing finger grips that will make it darn near impossible to drop or slip.I dont recommend this brand unless you can't get to a Dick's Sporting Goods in your area."
4,Valeo Medicine Ball,This ball is great. I like the grip on it so when my hands get sweaty it's not hard to grasp.
1,Not for P90X2,This medicine ball would be fine for conventional exercise but it is definitely not suitable for P90X2. I purchased the lighter weight for portability but the ball collapses when you do pushups on them - not good for your wrists. Buy the P90X branded merchandise (what I eventually did) - it is designed for purpose.
1,Decieved by advertized pictures,"If you do not mind working with a smaller ball (smaller than the picture and smaller than a basketball) go ahead and buy this Medicine ball. I coach youth basketball and we were very disappointed when we took this little ball out of the box. It does weigh four pounds...however, the pictures were deceptive. I need a ball near the size of a basketball. Very disappointed."
4,Great Medicine Ball,"This is a great medicine ball. Excellent quality I ordered the 4, 6 & 8lbs; love them! Perfect for toning and core training. They have the texture of little basket balls. Also, the 6 & 8lb are a bit bigger than the 4lb. I would only say that if you want to do any exercise that you need to ""wedge"" the ball between, for example, your calf and hamstring for leg lifts to do glute work, get a softer exercise ball. This is a true (hard) medicine ball."
5,great value,"I'm very pleased with this med ball. Great quality at a very reasonable price. I've been shopping for this item for awhile and looked at the usual online fitness product sites, at local sporting good stores as well as the ""marts"" before selecting this one. It was an excellent price with high quality. There's no reason to pay more."
3,DrYvette,"Great price, horrible rubber tire smell. My brand new physical therapy clinic of 3 weeks still smells like rubber and patients have complained. We've tried scrubbing it with lysol wipes which helped a little but the smell is super strong. On a more positive note, it is perfect for our medicine ball rebounder. I hope the smell fades soon!"
4,Medicine Ball Review,I love my 8 pound Valeo medicine ball. I use the workout sheet with its list of exercises and am very happy with the workout. I had a 2 pound ball but needed more of a challenge. The ball arived in perfect condition and is a nice addition to my other exercise items.
5,E40 and anyone who raps by his side deserves 5 stars,"E40, all love to ya! E40 is the craziest rapper that ever lived, just listen to his lyrics and unexplainable noises and terms. I wish I had an E40 dictionary when listening to his music. Anyhow, this CD sounds good, and its different to previous titles (eg. Element of Surprise & Hall of Game). This CD runs along the tunes of BOSS BALLIN. From Mr. Box"
2,Labour Slant,"I was deeply disappointed with this book. It should be entitled A LABOUR SLANT on Models of Political Economy. Don't come to this book looking for a relatively impartial look at Keynesianism or Monetarism or any other model. All Monetarists have horns. If you don't mind the 'Labour Party good, everybody else immoral' slant of this book then this might be the book for you. Finally, here is the kicker. I have always voted for left wing candidates. But I didn't know that I was buying a Labour tract."
2,Not entirely stable,"The upper pole and plate are fine, but the base is way way too small. It should be either a standard PA tripod or twice as large and square on the base. For the price I paid, I could have bought two pair of pro tripod stands, two mounts, and bolted a piece of black painted plywood to the top... and had four stands that worked instead of two that don't. At the moment I simply took the top pole off and put it on a pair of pro tripods and it's working fine, but that's a lot of money for just a pole and a plate. I would only recommend considering this product for very light speakers (preferrably with a base smaller than 9"" square) on very hard floors... without anyone or anything around that might bump it."
2,Awful Condition,"While I cannot hold Amazon.com responsible, when the box containing the stands arrived, the box was crushed and torn - good thing these stands are made of pretty sturdy metal. What I got: two (2) stands, one of which was scratched up, a bag of parts to put them together, and no documentation whatsoever. The only reason this isn't a one-star experience is that for me, function is over form for speaker stands, and they are solid, with pads that will protect your speakers/monitors. Now if my monitors would have come in this condition, I would riot, but seeing as these are just stands...your mileage may vary. Perhaps I got a disgruntled employee that particular day."
2,Caution: Potentially Dangerous,"Studio monitors are usually over 20lbs. Heavier than a frozen turkey. If you did not know, a fall with this weight is enough to break the bones in your foot or do grievous harm to a loved one. You don't want to live with these stands. I used 28lb JBLs on this stand with carpet spikes leveled out and they wobble at sitting height. It became painfully obvious that these are potentially dangerous. I would not put anything over 8lbs on these to be honest, they are ""rated at 100lb"" but this claim is ridiculous. I have also used Onstage 3-tier keyboard stand and it also wobbled. I will never buy from this company again. I thought I was getting a great product this time, but nothing they make seems good enough. I wasted all of my christmas money. I will caution you again, don't put anything remotley heavy on these. If you have 6 or 8 inch studio monitors these will not be good for you and could hurt someone. Industrialized garbage."
2,Quality Control is lacking,"All the metal parts of the stand look sturdy, however, one of my stands was not welded correctly made the pole quite crooked.I didn't mind the plastic feet being broken when I got them, but these didn't even perform well as stands."
4,Crazy Carnival,"By Crazy Itch Radio, Basement Jaxx has perfected their craft of mixing loud pompous and danceable music with diva-like or soulful female vocals. While the formula hasn't differed much since the splendid Rooty and the slightly uneven Kish Kash, the music here still seeks to thrill.Sounding more carnival than ever, each track has a happy and melodic vibe. The disc begins with a grand and over-the-top dramatic intro. First single Hush Boy is all diva and too much of a chip of the block from Kish Kash. You'd be happier with Les Visiteurs Remix. Better tracks are elsewhere including the fun second single Take Me Back To Your House, the quasi-trippy Smoke Bubbles, the soulful electro track Lights Go Down, the reggae-influenced Keep Keep On and the riotous Everybody which contains a delightful Bollywood bridge. (B+)"
3,Basement Jaxx - Crazy Itch Radio,"What happens when the hottest things in house music reach the point where they're no longer the hottest? Can they still keep relevant? This is the question that haunts Basement Jaxx's _Crazy Itch Radio_. These musical polyglots can still craft cracking tunes, whether the banjo-smacking and strings of ""Take Me Back to Your House,"" the Balkan-inspired horns in ""Hey You,"" or the gospel/Bollywood stomp of ""Everybody."" But you also get the feeling that they're recycling several of their earlier ideas. The ""Hush Boy"" recalls ""Red Alert"" from their debut album _Remedy_, especially with the screeching chorus. ""Hush Boy"" also has much sillier vocals. Even ""Everybody"" starts off suspiciously like ""Breakaway"" from _Rooty_ before it finally moves into its own. Their slower tracks like ""Lights Go Down"" and ""Keep Keep On"" show that they're not always about the beat... even if that's where their strength is. So while this album isn't a revelation, it's plenty fun for everyone."
2,Thanks for the frisbee,"If the idea behind this album were to see what happens when talented house gurus are randomly thrown at new styles they aren't good at, this would be a satirical gem. As a serious ambition, it's little more than over-polished mediocrity with wasted talent and no soul. 2 stars only because the label is partly to blame, with its obvious aim for US airplay (bad, BAD move).Play it upside down in your CD player, it sounds better."
3,NOT as good as people say it is,"Basement Jaxx; are you kidding me ? what's this ?This album is not up there with other Basement Jaxx albums like rooty or remedy. It lacks the funk of tracks like ""where's your head at"" or ""Right here's the spot"" or ""Romeo"" and I can keep going. Some tracks I can listen to, others are too slow or just lack that beat. This is not boom boom or my zoom zoom.The only tracks I like:4) Take Me back to your house5) Hey U7) Run 4 CoverI picked it up just because it was Basement Jaxx and I usually love their stuff. I strongly suggest you sample the tracks and listen carefully before you buy. Also, the music/compositions are a little more complex than your usual bass and elements. my honest 2 cents."
3,"Frankly, dissapointing","This album was kind of a surprise to me. I had no idea it was coming out and than their it was. GREAT!! BUY IT!! LISTEN!! HUH!! Okay I realize that the Jaxx like to prove they are completely versatile ya know but it's like they took everything that I didn't like about Kish Kash (which I still love) and brought that with them into the making of this album. Sorry guys but I have to ask, ""Where's Your Heads At!"""
1,Down the slippery slope,"That should be what the Jaxx should name their next album. Kish Kash was pop trash, and this album is worse. They are a dance act that is afraid of being a dance act. Remedy and Rooty had so much energy, and I still listen to them, and they still sound fresh. I couldn't even get through Crazy Itch Radio.Even though I have been listening to the Jaxx since 98 or 99, and consider myself an avid fan, I can't recommend this album to anyone."
1,I found the book to fall short of being usefull,"I was looking for a book that explains the technical differences in various types of lenses. Multifocal, bifocal, aspherical, high index, polycarb, plastic, glass, abbe numbers etc. How does one choose and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each type and manufacturers design. I was also interested in the differences in contacts. Torics, bifocals, etc etc. The book is technically lame. It was no help whatsoever. Ask your optometrist was the redcomendation. I learned nothing from this book! Nothing!"
2,"Too Clinical, Not Consumer Friendly","A disappointing book. Talks down to consumers -- that old fashioned doctor/dumb patient relationship. There is little in this book in the way of really helpful content for those who want to know about what type of lenses to select, what the difference are in lens coatings, etc. The orientation is more of the ""ask your eyedoc"" orientation. There is LOTS of general stuff, but not enough to be really helpful in making decisions. If you are looking for a basic reference book about eye problems and how your eyes work, this book is actually quite good. But, do not buy this book if you want real help on where and what to buy in the way of eyeglasses or contact lenses."
4,"Good movie, great CD!",Awesome movie...even better soundtrack...not much else to say. Every song is impressive in it's own way. Worth the buck.
4,Cruel Intentions OST,"Aside from over played radio-friendly dance and indie anthems, Fatboy Slim's 'Praise You' and the Verve's 'Bittersweet Symphony' respectively, the 'Cruel Intentions OST' is a stunning collection of relatively unknown alternative and rock tracks. Standout tunes strike me as the Counting Crow's 'Colourblind' for its dark melody, and Craig Armstrong's 'This Love' for it's utterly haunting vocals. Both will transport you back to the heartwrenching scenes in the film in which the songs feature. More uplifting however are Blur's 'Coffee and TV', the fantastic headbanger 'Every You Every Me' by Placebo, and the lush + dreamy lyrics of Abra Moore's Trip on Love."
1,"i thought it was very average, it could've done better","i have seen the moive and i have read reviews on this movie. the soud track however was very bad, i thought the songs didin't accompany the actual moive as well. it certainly could have been more atricst out there that could have suited with the moive more."
4,cruel intentions - great music,i enjoyed the film more because of the soundtrack and even though i didnt know alot of the artists i've grown to love some of the songs i hadnt heard before. its a great drive time compilation.
3,I like the movie and the CD has a lot of good songs.,"I like this cd because of the Counting Crows song ""Colorblind"" and the Craig Armstrong song, ""This Love"". The entire cd is full of great songs. It has become one I listen to a lot."
4,Lovely,"I must tell u this CD is great. As soon as I saw the movie I rushed out to bye it. I keep listening, because it's a very good record. Also the songs are placed in a good order, so that when u listen to it, it reminds u of the movie. Every teenager must have it!"
4,The Perfect Music for a Vindictive Movie,"I love the dark, enticing music on this soundtrack. I really want to get the Marcy Playground CD with ""Comin' up From Behind"" on it. Also, I can't wait for Counting Crows with ""Colorblind"". This is such a sultry compilation!"
4,It's great with a bunch of new artists!,"This is an AWESOME soundtrack! The only song that I wish was on it is ""How Soon Is Now"" by Love Spit Love. That is kind of the theme song for the movie. Other than that the soundtrack has a lot of new artists that are great! If you liked the movie, get the soundtrack. The cd case also has some cool pictures from the movie. In general, this cd was awesome and it's definitely one to have in your stash!"
2,"""Intentions"" is more cruel, than ""cool"".","I was lucky enough to preview this soundtrack before it was released. Well, lucky isn't the best word to use. This soundtrack lacks a track that matches the plot of the movie. I suppose I am partial to more ""well-known"" artists, and have yet to grow accustomed to these new artists' styles. The best track, ""Bittersweet Symphony"" by Verve, is strangely placed as the last number. If you are completely swept off your feet by the movie, then by all means buy the soundtrack. If you did not care much for the film (starring Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Reese Witherspoon), then save your money for a better cause: the ""Buffy"" album."
5,FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY-ULTIMATE SOUNDTRACK,"Please listen to me when I say GET THIS CD. Because no matter what kind of music you like you'll like this. My boyfriend likes bass and rap, and I like slow songs and there is a song on there with so much loud bass but its a slow song, thats not the only one every song on here is awesome!"
5,Un concentré pop-rock-indé,"Un prix vert aguicheur, quelques noms connus (craig armstrong, Placebo, Blur,...) et voilà l'achat parfait d'un film alors inconnu. De superbes passages comme ""Every me,Every You"" et la découverte d'autres groupes peu connus. Un style très fight !"
4,"Instrumentals, where are they?","I purchased Cruel Intentions CD, but I also wish to have the instrumental music appeared on the suspense moments of the film."
4,Very cool!,"I think this is the best movie soundtrack in a long time. My favorite tracks on the disc are ""Praise You"" (Fatboy Slim), ""Coffee & TV"" (Blur), ""Comin' Up From Behind"" (Marcy Playground), ""Secretly"" (Skunk Anansie), ""Addictive"" (Faithless) and ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" (The Verve). The rest is good too!"
4,i thought the cd had originality and awesome music.,i have seen the movie and the soundtrack is just as good..it has different styles that everyone can enjoy and the songs do not get boring after listening to them over and over again..i definitely recommend this soundtrack
5,"How can anyone resist Ryan, Reese, Sarah, and Selma?","Besides the fact that this movie is now my absolute favorite of all time, the cd for the picture is just as sexy, evil, and irresistable! The best tracks have to be FatBoy Slim ""Praise You"" Placebo ""Every You Every Me"" The Verve ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" and my favorite track ""Colorblind"" by Counting Crows. If you loved the movie, then pick up the cd, today!!"
5,This CD is awesome!,"This is one of the best CDs I have gotton in a while. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I think Ryan Philippe is really cute. All the songs went well with the actions in the movie. I really like track 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, & 14. Just get the CD you won't regret it!"
3,Good Movie and only three songs that I like,"This is movie is truly awesome, however the soundtrack is not that great. I encourage you to watch the following movie's Cruel Intentions 2, Closer, American Psycho,Fight Club and the upcoming movie ConstantinePeace to all"
5,Great Soundtrack!,"This is possibly one of the best soundtracks ever made. Each song is very emotional and fits it's part in the movie perfectly. To me the soundtrack is what makes the movie. The songs ""Bittersweet Symphony"" and ""Colorblind"" can bring anyone to tears. I highly recommend this soundtrack to everyone!"
4,Great mood music,"With the exception of a few tracks (praise you to be exact) this album delivers in the gloomy mood music that makes the movie what it is. Dark and sureal. Just listen to the eerie yet beautiful 'Colorblind' which is the highlight of this album, and the movie may I add. Plecebo and Blur deliver wonderfully, Blur handing us one of the best tracks here with 'Coffee and TV'...'Bedroom dancing' is decent but can't hold a candle to Skunk Anansie's 'Secretly' or even one hit wonders Marcy's Playground with 'Comin' Up From Behind' their most standoutish track since 'Sex and Candy'...all in all this is a great soundtrack to compliment a great film, with a few dips in the road but thats to be expected...(I can't help it, I just really really hate that Fatboy Slim song...never liked it and never will)"
5,The music really made this movie,"When i saw Cruel Intentions I thought it was kind of a strange movie. But the soundtrack really made up for it! I have seen the movie for 4 times now, and I think it's a great movie. The soundtrack rocks! My fav songs are:""Every You and Every Me"" by Placebo""Bittersweet Symphony"" by The Verve (love that!)""Coffee & TV"" by Blur""Colorblind"" by Counting Crows""Secretely"" by Skunk Anansie"
5,Cruel Intentions soundtrack,I love the music selection. Its amazing how impacting the songs are. Its just a great CD. I love it!
3,"Good, but not impressive","I bought this TV on Jan. 22nd 2009 for, I believe, a very good price ($1600)The picture on this Sharp looks watery; one could see the pixels moving and not the actual object. It's hard to explain but I'm not that happy about my new TV.I went to a Best Buy store and watched few other brands and I realized this model I've got (LC52D92U) might not be one of the better ones. Spend a little more and get a Samsung or a Sony Bravia"
5,WOW!,This is my 2nd high def set and by far the best. Picture is stunning in high def (Receiving 1080i from Comcast) and very good with regular dvd and non-high def feeds as well. With so many inputs this set has some staying power.Highly recommended!
5,Great product quick delivery,These dimmer switches are awesome. 3 levels with regular bulb with simple easy access. I got these for all those lamps I have to reach awkwardly to turn on. Now it's simple and easy. Love theses!
2,Greatest idea and poorest execution I've seen in a while,I bought five of these and of these only two are in operation. 3 of them simply don't work with the same lamp as the other 2 that don't work (failing a 'known-good' test). If you look at the metal leads they are exposed and look like they were assembled by a 2nd grader. I've only written a couple of reviews on Amazon over the year but I really feel cheated here :( I'm too lazy to find the boxes and send them back as they were so cheap.
1,Level Touch Pad Dimmer,I HAD THE DIMMER FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT STARTED TO FLICKER. I JUST SENT IT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER AND HOPE THAT THEY REPLACE IT. THEY CLAIM IT HAS A FIVE YEAR WARRANTY.
1,Two didn't work!,"Tried two units to replace the same one that worked for about a year. Neither one worked. No, it's not because I didn't hook it up correctly, they were definitely defective!"
3,Works so far!,"Seems to be working OK for now, only had it a week or two.It's one of those things that either work or they don't, and so far it's still working!What else can I say?WDM"
4,WORKS AS EXPECTED,The dimmer was to replace one that came as part of a under the cabinet light system that failed. It is working very well.
2,Doesn't last long!,I bought an under-cabinet lighting set from Lowe's that included this 6043 series dimmer. It only lasted about 9 months. Typical made-in-China; cheap but poor quality!
3,"Love it, but..","This switch works well for me. However, after about 3 years it failed when a light bulb blew out as others have reported. I just bought another one."
2,"Convenient, but short life!","This product is convenient (especially if you're short and can't quite reach the switch on a tall lamp), until it breaks! The first one I ordered lasted about 9 months until it just shorted out. I got a second one which lasted about a month, and again, it just shorted out. Part of it has to do with static electricity generated in the winter time in my house, so when I go to touch it, I shock it, thus making it short out. Luckily the price is reasonable, so I'm not out a ton of money. I will NOT be buying a third and will either buy shorter lamps or learn to stretch if I need to turn on my lamp. You're better off getting an actual touch lamp instead of this quick fix."
2,Fine until it breaks!,"We've been through two of these. They're wonderful...until....The first one broke when we screwed in a new light bulb while it was plugged in and turned on. That might be put down to ""doing something dumb"" - perhaps it would have been best to turn the light off first.The second one broke when a bulb burned out while it was running!I am looking for the company that makes it, and intending to complain. I would really like to have one of these - IFF it could be persuaded to continue to work. I'd hate to think I have to use a surge-protector on an ordinary floor lamp!"
2,Shorts out -- but otherwise good :p,"We love them... except after 1 month, static electricty from putting on my robe shocked it, and it no longer works. Other reviewers are saying the same... so if you are going to buy it... buy a bunch cuz you'll need 'em."
2,They don't last,"I tried a brand called Touch & Glow which is pretty much the same thing, only it's rated at 400 Watts, so it should be even more resilient. You're lucky if they last six months. They don't even outlast the 100 Watt bulb. This is a chronic problem with all these touch dimmers, no matter what the configuration (screw in, plug, pad). I have the same problem with battery powered garden lights. If they last a year, you're lucky. It gets to be rather expensive."
4,Very satisfied!,"As a college student, I found this book to be very informative and interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in draft horses or owns drafts themselves. This books not only gives general information about horse care and health, it also comments on things that are more prevalennt in draft breeds. I was personally a little disappointed that the images in the book were not in color, which leaves out a detailed image of what certain conditions may look like. Overall, I am very satisfied with this book and will have it in my collection for the rest of my life."
5,Must have for draft horse owners!!,"This really is THE Owner's Manual for draft horses! I've had 2 of them and this book has been invaluable over the years. They are definitely a different kind of horse, it's like having a small elephant in your backyard and I believe this book helps to prepare you for this. I have since given this book another family to learn from, but should I choose to have another draft horse, I WILL buy another copy.Side note: Dr. Valentine is a brilliant, caring, wonderful woman and was very open to consulting with me about my EPSM positive Percheron gelding. Her expert advice allowed me more time to spend with him before he passed. If you need her advice on EPSM and are able, setting up a consult with her could make all of the difference for your horse. :)"
5,Track Listing,"Here is the track listing for this cassette single:Side A:1. Sobb Story (LP Version)2. Sobb Story (Remix)3. Sobb Story (Instrumental)Side B:1. Sound of the Zeekers (LP Version)2. Sound of the Zeekers (Instrumental)3. Case of the P.T.A. (Remix) (Actually, this is a re-recorded version with different instrumentation and lyrics, even better than the album version)"
2,Not Impressed,"This unit has several nice features however I was not impressed with the battery life. I spent about 2 1/2 hours learning how to use and loading this unit. The next day after playing for 1 1/2 hours the battery was dead. The second battery lasted 3 1/2 hours. Then I tried a rechargeable which lasted 2 1/2 hours. I don't see how the manufacturer can say 12 hour battery life. Additionally, the manual was of little use."
4,Okay,I just got my iclick yesterday.The iclick's performance isn't bad. It just took me a couple of hours to figure out that i shouldn't use windows media player to sync the files. I finally figured out ON MY OWN (because the website was useless) that i should copy & paste songs into the player after connecting it to the pc.There also seems to be a little bit of static or feedback while i'm listning to the player. It's not real bad but it's noticeable for a person who is picky about the way their music sounds. I don't know if an earphone replacement would matter.Another thing is I thought that 1GB players held 500 songs. I was obviously wrong.The player is good for what it cost.
5,Great Storage,"I just finished college this year and my parents got me this MP3 for part of my graduation gift. It's been perfect for me over the summer. I've spent most of my time on a boat so, we only come into port every few days to refuel and reload. So I've found that this MP3 has really been great for the few days that I spend on the ship since I can store enough music on it to last me until we get back into port. It's awesome."
3,Burning my cd ? I don't think so...,"Tracklist: The Immortal, Dark Insanity, Dead Inside, Diva Satanica, Pilgrim, Silverwing, Beast Of Man, Bass Intro/Tears Of The Dead, Bridge Of Destiny, Transmigration Macabre, Angelclaw11 tracks: 2 from ""Black earth"" (only ! ), 3 from ""Stigmata"" and the rest - 6 tracks from ""Burning bridges"". Total time: 48:47This, limited to Japan only, CD sounds good, audience is great, but there are too much songs from the latest (and the weakest IMHO) album. I think this show is short. Too short. This CD should cost [less].... There are some PC files on the disc (short interview, some live shots, pictures)PS. I've found Arch Enemy/ Cathedral bootleg called ""Black birth machine"" (2CD) from Osaka 97. It's better than ""Burning Japan""..."
3,Nice...,"I once owned the lp and then when I moved I had everything,but the vinyl, lol. Of course I purchased another one and again it was worth it. The compliation is really a nice one. You will enjoy it."
5,AWESOME WINE....,"This CD is awesome. I cannot stop listening to it. Her soulful voice just touches something deep inside every woman. From the sad and mournful, LOVE IS A LOSING GAME to the taunting tease of YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD, she touches every emotion. BUY THIS CD!"
4,If you like winehouse,"You have to like her type of music to like the CD obviously but Id say the best songs on here are the ones youll hear on the radio. The rest of the CD is a little lack luster but good enough to bop along to. Unless you really LOVE winehouse youd probably be better off downloading (legally, ha) ""rehab"" and ""back to black"". The remix at the end is pretty cool though."
3,"talented artist, original music","so much has already been written about Winehouse- aside from her personal issues, she is very talented vocally. Her music almost has a retro jazz feel mixed with some trip-hop engineering. She well deserved all the Grammys she recently won. This cd will stand the test of time."
4,Aching lyrics,Read the lyrics of these songs and you'll know that Amy is a woman in pain. You'd not guess it though from these tunes that will have you singing along about not going to rehab. Fabulous retro sound.
4,Give it a try,"I really did not like Amy Winehouse. I tried to listen to her because so many of my friends loved her, but I couldn't do it. I tried again after she passed away, and I still couldn't get into her music. Then Back to Black came on the radio. Apparently, between the cover of that song on Glee and hearing it randomly on the radio or at my friends' homes, I knew every word. I decided one last time to listen to the samples, and decided to finally buy it. I've listened to it 4 times already, and I bought it yesterday. It's that good. So if you're on the fence, or you've contemplated it a few times but keep saying no, say yes. It's well worth your money and time."
4,music to share,"this is a nice change of recent/newer music.i bought my own copy & purchased a second for my dad as a father's day gift.(he enjoys it and is turning others onto it, just the same)my daughter, 7 at the time of purchase, had me put some of the tunes on her ipod.that speaks volumes."
4,Great CD,"Love the music, very blues sounding. Some of the music sounds like it came from other songs, but it's a great make you smile CD."
4,Gets some getting used to,"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend in the Uk and I've listened to it a few times and she grows on you. Very different, good beat"
4,Finally a breath of fresh air!....Musically,"Amy Winehouse is the best thing to come along in YEARS. With a touch of girl group pop and motown soul, and a dash of jazz Amy's got it. When she sings she reminds me of Etta James. For just being 23 years old her lyrics speak of love lost and found as if she had been 40. Not to be negative...the people who don't get what she is all about are really missing out on something special. Amy Winehose fills a void that has been missing in the music industry for the last 15 years. I look forward to her next album. And Amy if you read this....You rock girrrl!"
2,Derivative,"Overhyped music. I don't understand why it's acclaimed - it's a rip off of great singers like Dinah Washington. Too noisy, brassy, and overproduced. No no no."
2,Don't see what the big deal is,"I bought this cd a few months back, and I think I have only listened to it one time all the way through. Honestly, this cd sounds like something an older aunt would listen to. I really don't get the hype about Amy Winehouse at all. Sorry but if I wanted to hear 60's music I would go buy some Motown classics."
3,I don't get it!,"What's the attraction to Amy Winehouse? Hasn't this Billy Holiday thing been done to death by Madeleine Peyroux - cute at first but...? Granted Amy adds a heaping helping of smoky post war German cabaret, but is that a good thing?! Tatoos. Cigarettes. Rehab. Haven't we kind of run the course on the whole emphatuation with Harley's, pool halls, gothic tattoo fonts?2008.02: It hit me yesterday, Amy is shredding for Elmer Fudd! ""I tow you I was twouble..."" :-)"
1,I've heard this before,"when I first heard this cd, i actually was diggin it a little bit, but i realized why... these songs are all rip offs from diana ross and dusty springfield and other greats. people praising her originality need to take a listen to the greats of the past who've already done it, and did it waaaayyy better."
2,White chocolate Erykah Badu...,"To be fair, girlfriend can sing. And even Lauren Hill has some demons that she needs to clear up. Both Amy and Erykah Badu channel that same lazy drawl that Billy Holiday often had from being in a drug-induced haze. Although Amy's singing is good and the record has decent production, the material is hardly fresh or innovative. Psychedelic Copycat is more like it. There must be a lot of folks out there that want music to get high to. This record provides it in spades."
3,"CD, case, and shipment","The CD was dirty inside, but when cleaned it was perfect - no issues. The company shipped it within a good time - no problems. I didn't really care for the music except for a few songs, but otherwise the company and shipment went just fine - no qualms."
1,What a Disappointment,I heard the hype so I bought this album. What a disappointment! You either love this style of music or hate it. I hate it. Lily Allen is one million times more talented and a lot more fun!
1,disappointing,"i ourchased this cd after hearing all the buzz, and honestly, there is very little to this album... nothing new."
1,This sucks.,Noise is not music. She can't sick a lick and no musical training to speak of. This cd sounds like a train wreck ...only not so lyrical.
3,She really does sound like Shirley Bassey.,"On her first track, ""I Cheated Myself"". Amy Winehouse is one serious singer. Be hearing more from her soon."
4,A singer to celebrate,"Oh my God. Yes. Like Pink and a handful of others, Amy Winehouse is the real thing. I can feel a Janis Joplin vibe. But she is also uniquely herself. When Amy Winehouse says she's in pain...you feel the pain. It hurts. When she's sings about feeling sexy....it oozes out of the sound system. And when she says she's trouble...you can sense the danger, you know that she's no good. In this day of overly produced, doctored voices, synthisized cuties, and empty reverbed divas...you rarely get the feeling of raw emotion and gutsy feelings. It's all here in these tracks...The lyrics are terrific too, each song filled with the passions of a powerful short story. You feel like your sitting over a scotch with her in a dark bar. You find yourself saying, ""Yeah, Amy I felt that. I've been in that situation....tell me more, darlin'"""
4,BAD PACKING,"The vinyl was not correctly packed, i don't know if they couldn't find a proper box in Amazon or wherever was packed and sent, so the record would comfortably fit in there; when i got the package, the vinyl nearly fitted in the box so it was sligthly folded from one side, sligthly BUT still folded so at the begining the sound was a bit weird, its not like a record will recover shape all by it self, but i did what i could to make recover the flat shape.It was disappointing to find my poor pretty vinyl forced to fit on a box."
2,what a dissapointment,"i looked forward to receiving this c.d.seeing ms. winehouse on t.v. made me curious as to how well she performed.sufficient to say i was not happy with the c.d. as a whole.she has great talent, is unusual and has a shot at super stardom. i hope she doesn't drown in her own negativity. both professionaly nor personaly."
2,amy winehouse. back to black,"I liked what I heard but I was a little disappointed that there was not more songs,more dynamic songs. I don't know , I thought that something was lacking in the CD."
5,great cd,i received this product ( a cd ) very quick! i would def. buy something from this site again. the price is also very good and its reasonable.
4,What can one say,A great album from a very talented artist who died way to you with way too short a legacy. Unfortunately this will remain probably the best of her works.
4,inimitable voice,Very good cd. A disc that can not miss in your collection. Good voice and good music. Unique and beautiful
3,Excellent Album,"No matter what you think of Ms. Winehouse's eccentric and in your face image, such as the bee-hive hair, the tatoos, and excessive drinking, you have to give her props: the girl can sing. Not only that, but she knows what the hell she is singing about. She's not trying to show off her pipes or show that she's ""dirrty,"" she simply sings about issues that are real to her. Overall, the album is solid and by far one of the best albums of 2007. However, my only complaint about this CD and Ms. Winehouse is that I wish there was more diversity in what she sings about. Singing about sex, drugs, and bad men is fine, but to dedicate a whole album to it eventually gets kind of old, uninspiring, and drawn out way too much. After the first 3 tracks, the whole album starts to sound like one entire song about the same thing: drugs, weed, bad men, and sex. Hopefully the girl will show the world what she's really all about, still be herself, but show some more depth to her image."
5,Awesome Amy Winehouse CD,"She has this incredible voice and the songwriting is superb (clever, fun and real). This is a throw back album -- it feels like she should have been part of the Motown sound. My new favorite!!"
3,back to black,"A few really excellent songs, but most of the album is just ok. Don't know what else to say about it"
2,arrived warped,My copy came in very warped and I have not had the chance to listen to it. I am returning it and will look for a better release.
4,Super,"Back to Black is the second studio album by English recording artist Amy Winehouse, released on 27 October 2006 by Island Records. It is the last album released in her lifetime. The album incorporates 1960s soul music styles and modern R&B; production, with subjective lyrics that concern relationships and reflect on Winehouse's experiences with drinking, sex, and drugs. The album produced several singles, including ""Rehab"", ""You Know I'm No Good"", ""Back to Black"", ""Tears Dry on Their Own"", and ""Love Is a Losing Game"". Back to Black received generally positive reviews from music critics, earning praise for its classicist soul influences, Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson's production, and Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style.This vinyl version exalts the sound and the tune."
5,My new favorite CD,I love this CD. I can't stop listening to it. Amy's sound is so unique. Her voice is absolutely intoxicating. The mix of old style with new elements makes for interesting music and the lyrics really kick you in the pants. I highly recommend this CD for anyone that is looking for something different.
5,Love It.,"It is so great that you allow us to listen to samples, we really know what we are buying...thanks."
2,just alright,"i have heard this album and I don't get all the hype. AMy Winehouse is creative to a extent,but she sounds like Ronnie Spector trying to channel Lauyren Hill and it has a mixed reaction. the retro Girl Group style and sound of the 60's is charming for a while and then it starts to wear then and feels gimmicky after a while. Production and Musicianship is solid, and the writing has some moments,but the overall vibe doesn't knock me out."
2,"Could have been 5 stars, But...","I love the music and Ms. Winehouse's voice and tone are wonderful. However, I think this cd would've been really great if she didn't use vulgar language unnecessarily. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Puritan, I own music with explicit lyrics, that are used to fully express thoughts or feelings, but the amazing lyricism of this artist doesn't need them. It seems like she peppered these words into her music in order to make sure that the listeners would know without a doubt that we're NOT listening to a throw back band or maybe to make sure she stayed connected to her age group or maybe street cred. I don't know, I feel like her lyrics are hard core and expressive of a young woman's deep angst and desires. I just would've enjoyed the cd more withouth the oddly placed and awkward use of vulgarity. I hope that Ms. Winehouse has a long career and that she continues to grow as an artist."
2,"Great voice, disappointing album","She's got a great voice, some of the lyrics are really interesting, but musically this CD is repetitive and tedious.I will never ever listen to it all the way through again (though I may cherry pick one or two numbers for a mix) because every song began to sound the same. Another reviewer commented on the drummer and another on the production values of the CD. I agree. Relentlessly base heavy and boring. Motown recordings suffered from poor production values, but that was then -- we can have better today.I wish her luck. She has a neat style and a fantastic voice."
3,Back to Black-Amy Whinehouse,This is an okay album. Re-Hab and I'm No Good are the best. The rest is mediocre.
2,Is that a drum machine on Rehab?,"The production value of this disc left me cold. Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what? Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up."
3,I was disappointed,"This CD was not so hot to me. I was really disappointed because I always wanted to try Amy Winehouse's music to see what all the fuss was bout. I won't be purchasing any more of Amy Winehouse's music. But, that's just me."
4,you can believe the hype,"I kept reading about Amy Winehouse and was cynical. Could she really be as good as the critics were saying? Time and time again I've found that critics darlings don't live up to the hype. Well, I finally broke down and bought the CD and I was blown away. I've played the Back to Black song especially five times in a row so far. Amy Winehouse is a scrawny little thing but has this huge, emotionally raw and absolutely amazing voice. She sounds like nobody else I've ever heard. This CD has strong music and strong writing. You do not want to play it in front of your mom or your kids but just looking at Amy Winehouse should tell you that this chick doesn't;t sing hymns, okay?If half the stuff I've read about Winehouse is true she may end up doing her own version of the Billie Holiday story but for now she's put out a supremely satisfying work.This girl lives up to the hype. Run out and buy this CD."
5,Yummy!,"Back to Black is to the ears as your favorite coat's to your shoulders; having it on makes you feel a little of the good about everything, no matter your present circumstances. Somehow Miss Winehouse has managed to yank the sound of 1962 and wind that fuzzy, fat warm vibe around her own frank, funny lyrics. Complete with horn section, no less! The finished product is a sweet souffle of soul that adds inches to bust, hips and thighs. Martinis will magically materialize in your casually spread fingers. Suddenly you'll be on film, in soft focus, in golden light, thinking to yourself ""Amy Winehouse has captured in song how much that last relationship screwed me up inside"". I'm going to hold my breath until she's featured in the next James Bond theme song. Go out and buy her CD before I die!"
5,Great Music!!!,"It has been a while since I have been able to listen to an albulm from start to finish, and genuinely love every single song...Back to Black has accomplished this.Amy Winehouse's unique voice and personable lyrics makes this album a must have.The music transcends age barriers...my mother heard this cd and now it is a staple in her car, she is 43 and I am 20."
5,Great album,"This is one of the best albums I have purchased in a long time. She is amazingly talented! I am so sad about her personal life and the road she is on. It can only end in disaster, which would be such a loss to her family and the music world."
4,Very Talented Singer,"Winehouse is capable of amazing vocals and styles, my only reservation is she also uses swear words in the middle of some otherwise excellent songs. To each his own, but I found them not only needless, but distracting from the overall quality of some of the songs. Other than that, this was an excellent album worth buying!"
4,amazing!,"WOW! If you have not yet heard Amy Winehouse, you're really missing out. A mix of cocktails in the 60's and the grittiness of today, she lures you in with soulful sounds, then shocks you with some amazing bravada."
3,"Interesting voice, but","I don't like the songs, in that they don't seem like real songs. They're more like arrangements with a retro flair put to together by a superslick team of marketers to showcase her voice. Oh sure- it's hip, it's slick, it sounds cool, but there's no soul in this ""soul."" Winehouse has the potential to be more than a ""cool"" trend. She needs to find herself a real songwriter."
1,Another music industry rip off!,"I did some, but not enough research before purchasing this. It is a major disappointment. The quality of this recording sucks, the bass and drums are boomy and too loud with no depth to them at all. I'm positive that in a year or two, they will put out a remastered version of this so that the people who really like this stuff can be seperated from some more of their money. The band arrangements suck, they do absolutely nothing interesting. The monotony of the 8 and if you are lucky 16 bar drum machine patterns is mind numbing to listen to. Admittedly, Winehouse has some skills and nuances that can be pleasing, but this recording seems to stress her more abrasive and nasal qualities instead. Maybe that's all that can cut through the cheesy, overly loud arrangements the band is playing. I fault the Island/Universal Records for this dreck. They did Winehouse no favors with this production, it sounds like it was made by a bunch of amateurs with bad attitudes."
1,"Original...??? NO, NO, NO... Sounds like a recyled product!!!!","I don't know why, but since I heard ""Rehab"" from Amy Winehouse, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""Gosh, she sounds as a prefab-recycled product from the Record Industry""!Therefore, you may like or dislike her musical style. In my very humble opinion, I don't like this singer at all. Her music is a well-made 'collage' of other musical styles. Nothing new. She pretends to sound like... Etta James?? Her image of the 'New Bad Girl in the Music Scene' appears completely false and empty. Lots of dirty language in her songs, add nothing better to her music and image.Then I say: AW is a NO-NO-NO choice for serious music listeners! Don't spend your money buying music from this artist. Period!"
2,Winehouse may age better with time,"Despite the critical praise heaped on Winehouse's debut, it's not all it's cracked up to be. That's not saying it doesn't have it's moments. Both ""Rehab"" and ""I'm No Good"" are great tunes and really capture a great 60's R&B vibe, but after a dozen listenings I'd be hard pressed to remember any other tunes that grab me. The ""rewriting"" of Ashford and Simpson's ""Ain't no Mountain"" is sort of clever, but if your going that far, write your own original tune. I hope Amy's aging process will produce a better product with future efforts."
2,too soon,"really hate to see someone who seems to have sometalent for show business, some singing ability,but it is wasted on sloppy singing and nodirection. it is too early to give this girl any awards."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the latest Joss Stone CD and your site said if I liked her, I would like Amy Winehouse. I don't know how you can put them in the same category. Very disappointed!"
4,Cool Album!,"I'm actually not a fan of Amy Winehouse (the person), but the Amy Winehouse (musician) is great!My absolute favorite song on BACK TO BLACK would have to be ""Tears Dry on Their Own."" Also, I still kind of like ""Rehab,"" which was a smash hit last summer.I would recommend this album to people who love great R&B;/Jazz, sort of music, who like variety...it's a good album."
4,"Arrived On Time, Not so great edition","I like this album, and I bought the LP version because I thought it could be a collector's piece. But it's simpleand brief. I still like it because of it's sound, but it could bring more full size images and more memorabillia."
3,Amy Winehouse Back to Black Review,This is pretty good all things considered. I like her for her shock value and is a good mix for my cd player.
5,Yes it is that good,"You see all these 4 and 5 star reviews? Yes it is that good, not the music I would usually listen to, but Amy is great. Her songs have so much honesty that most music lacks nowadays. Rehab is a very soulful song about the struggles of addiction lines like ""I'm gonna lose my baby, so I always keep a bottle near."" Tears Dry On There Own is also another great song that I really like on the albumn, but I really like every song. It is worth every penny, I just hope she can get her life together, she has so much talent I don't think this is the last you will from this girl. Great job Amy!"
5,Fresh new music w/ a retro vibe,"I love this album!!! It's fresh and new; totally different from everything else out there; you get that retro vibe. There is not a bad song on it; unlike most albums if you know what I mean. You know you buy an album and it turns out the only good song on it was the one from the radio. Well not this one, it's great from the first track to the last. Can't wait for her next one!!!"
4,Winehouse Is A Surprise,"Purchased this cd solely on hype (and a duet withTony Bennet) and, well, you can FEEL it. That, for me, is what music is all about--feeling it. The down side is, she's passed and I get to wonder what we all will have missed in her future endeavors."
5,No one can ever match Amy,"The best album of this century. She is the realist singer I have ever heard. The only real singers we have left are Janet Jackson, Adele, Daniel Merriweather, Joss Stone. Amy had a very unique and wonderful voice."
1,Sound quality: terrible,"Can't listen to this CD on a reasonable installation. What are they doing to CD's? Sprinsteens Magic albums is compressed and distorted, this CD same thing. Most probably it will be OK on an iPod, but for audiophiles it is terrible. Don't buy this one, even if you like the music."
3,Nada nuevo bajo el sol?,"Una voz excelente , una banda ajustada, una producción fina y profecional.pero siento que estoy escuchando un disco de los años 50`con alta calidad audio y producción. Nada nuevo bajo el sol."
3,Great Voice - Great Back-up Band,"The unique quality of Winehouse's voice pulls me in to want to hear more. There are a few songs that you want to listen to again and again (like Back to Black), but like most albums there are other songs that should not have made the grade. But this does not stop me from wanting to put on the CD. The Dap Kings do a tremendous job of rounding out Winehouse's voice to its best advantage."
4,"Love the Amy, didn't love all of the songs","I think that Amy Winehouse is brilliant in every way. While I would have given the album five stars, I didn't love all of the songs enough. I could listen to this girl for hours, but watching her is more painful. I do hope that she gets herself together. Worth buying for Back to Black alone. It also bugs me that Jay Z claims to have discovered her when she was doing well in Britain long before he clapped eyes on her."
1,Low Quality Recording,"Saw her on TV, sounded OK, thought the CD would sound better.Wrong. The music is probably OK, but I haven't listened to it enough to know. The sound quality is totally unacceptable.It's hard to believe this is the sound the label was shooting for. It can't be just a case of one incompetent dork in the studio, because at least a few people must have heard this before it was released. Maybe I got a lemon somehow.A guy I know told me that it might be a black market copy, but I bought it from Amazon, so that doesn't seem likely, and even an illegal copy should sound better than this."
4,"Oh, Amy!","I really like this cd, I hate that most of the black artist can't make albums like this a receive critical acclaim, but that is a whole other story. I will however give Amy her props cause this cd is banging. She's weird, but cool. Love this cd! Buy it and I'm sure you will like it."
5,Amy on Vinyl? It's great!,"What can I say? We all know she can sing. The vinyl is pretty simple, but it sounds great and she sounds amazing on every track. I'd recommend this to any who wants to listen to great music on vinyl."
1,The vinyl version is awful,"I love the songs. This is a great album. But the vinyl version is a terrible production with poor dynamic range. Note that I have a very good system with NAD discreet components, Vandersteen speakers, a hand-rebuilt DUAL turntable, and a high-end GRADO cartridge. No other vinyl recordings that I own, old or new, sound this muddy."
5,Great selection,"When you wake up in the morning with Amy Winehouse playing in your head, you know you've made made a good decision in purchasing her CD. When you wake up the fourth morning in a row with the same Amy Winehouse song playing in your head, you know you're hooked! I've played this CD non-stop since I bought it. While her lyrics will rip your guts out, her music gets under your skin and you can't escape. AW lives on in Back to Black."
5,A nearly perfect recording,"I was familiar with the song 'Rehab' from the radio, so I thought I'd order this CD.I find her to be an amazing vocalist, ranging from a Ronnie Spector type sound to echoes of Dinah Washington on some songs, all supported by excellent retro-60's style arrangements, yet still managing to sound fresh, new and modern.I was transported back to when I was a kid, listening to the music of the early 60's on my tiny transistor radio....Worth EVERY PENNY!"
5,Wow! What a breath of fresh air!,"Amy Winehouse is in the house, people, and she IS to be reckoned with. Every time I listen to this cd I swear I'm listening to a close relative of Etta James. She harkens back to a time I wasn't old enough to enjoy during its heyday, and makes it her own. Mature, fun and emotional, her voice and lyrics stimulate the senses. In a world full of empty, media-hyped, insipid, half-naked popstars, Amy Winehouse rejuvinates the spirit. Perhaps, in the wake of American Idol trash, there is room in the music industry for REAL vocalists and songwriters to shine. At least, for the moment. Don't blink."
5,Back To Black,"Great CD. Music is beautiful. If you listen to her lyrics, you realize just how troubled she is and if you are a caring person, want to reach out and help her. Love every song."
5,A MUST HAVE CD!,"I am in LOVE with this CD..as well as the ""non"" clean version! They are both awesome. Amy has THE most unique voice! I've loaned the CD's to others, and they've gone out and bought the CD for themselves, too!I'm thrilled!"
4,Winehouse is a Powerhouse.,"Before last week I had never (at least never intentionally) listened to Amy Winehouse. I happened to check out some cuts here on Amazon, and I was impressed. Two days later I received Back to Black and slid it in to my player just after dinner. For a 22 year old who is on the scene just a short time, this is a blockbuster. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because she has some room for refinement, but I say, do not hesitate to get this disk. It will go down in history as an important work. My suggestion to Amy however is--- that Rehab, go go go"
4,Great American debut!,"I fell in love with the single ""Rehab"" when I first heard it on the radio. It was something different and original. Unique. There aren't words to describe this great song! Amy Winehouse has such a great voice. It's perfect for the bleusy music she sings on this album. If you like Joss Stone, then this album's for you. You can tell Amy has had many different musical influences. To be honest when I first heard ""Rehab"" I thought the singer was black. Her voice is that good! She sings to kind of an old fashioned style of music, allowing her to have fans of all ages. Older people may enjoy the old fashioned bluesy feel of her music and younger fans will enjoy a mainstream feel of her songs. This is one of the best albums of 2007 and I highly reccomend this if you enjoyed ""Rehab"" on the radio. It deserved to be a hit and so does this album."
4,Amy Winehouse - Back to Black,I enjoy listening to this very much. Vinyl is so much more entertaining. Looking forward to buying more vinyl online.
1,Bad package Vinyl was delivered damaged,"I am a consumer of Amazon books and this kind of problem almost doesn't happens, but this time the product I bought was delivered damaged, the cover of the vinyl came very mashed. What we can do about that?"
1,Do Not Buy,This is an absolutely abysmal LP. It is an embarrassment to Amy Winehouse who has a great voice and Vinyl should bring out the depth and quality in her unique voice. The reality is that they have stuffed up the engineering on this record so it sounds disgraceful. At first I though there was a problem with my stereo. After labouring through the first two songs I swapped it for a some other records I have which all sounded awesome. Then I put this back on and it still sounded horrible.I believe there is a European version that does sound good but this US version should not be on the shelves. Do not purchase for any price.......
5,Legandery Amy,I didn't take much notice of Amy's music until after she died (typical) eh? I bought this album to acquaint myself with her best music. It's a very good cross-section of her style and very listenable...I'll enjoy it for ever!
4,VERY GOOD!!!,"I FOUND THAT THIS CD VERY GOOD, AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE INTOOLD MOTOWN OR JAZZ."
1,This chick ain't dead yet?,"What? This broad is still alive?Remember when Ted Danson put on the ""blackface"" makeup and he got a pass on that because he was married to Whoopi? It was still offensive anyway, right? Even if this chick were married to Stevie Wonder (instead of that has-been britpop junkie) she really ought to ditch the fake black american accent... 'cos it sure is lame. She's a jewish English chick. Maybe she should try singing in her real accent instead of this minstrel show schtick.Almost as irritating as Eminem or Vanilla Ice."
1,Atrocious,"The editor's picked this as one of the Top 10 records of 2007? And the rest of the Top 10... who are these editors? What kind of musical background do they have? None - from my point-of-view! The most descriptive word I've seen about this album is 'drivel'. Amen. This is just plain awful. Sometimes I wish I wasn't a trained musician and didn't know what I know about composition, but the simple truth of the matter is that albums like these are a slap in the face of artists out there with actual talent."
1,Winey House,"This album is terrible. Winehouse grabs her attention by being a druggie, not showing up at gigs, and by being just plain weird. Her voice and music are lame. I can't believe people buy her music. There are a whole lot of better choices out there. I would say that the rich get richer when we purchase their music but in her case I think she goes out and buys more drugs. Please don't make her a martre by buying her music."
1,Only one interesting song,The first song has fun lyrics and is musically interesting. The second cut is just OK. Every one of the remaining cuts are real nothingness filler.
1,Overrated by ignorant white people,"Amy Winehouse has the singing chops of an average R&B singer. You could probably pick any female at random from the Cabrini Green neighborhood in Chicago, and they would be able to easily match her chops. Her ""hit"" single Rehab sounds like filler material from Motown. Not even a single. I guess if you're a British white chick, this qualifies you for all manner of accolades and critical praise. Wow, what a great sound, we've NEVER heard this before, and we've CERTAINLY never heard it done better!"
3,"Good, trashy soul","I like her soulful trashy, gypsy sound. Like a drunk Etta James, Shirley Bassey or a really trashed Aretha! Yes, the vocal inflection is overdone and a bit grating. But even some of the singers she seems to be trying to channel were overdoing it too. After a few listens, I found that her phrasing was just perfect on several songs. A super singer-composer. I would prefer this music played with a real band: the cheesy rhythm section on some of the tracks is weak. She sdeserves better than those awful, overdone beat-boxes used on all the ""R'n'B"" stuff nowadays. The horns sound okay but the production needs work."
5,Buy the UK edition of this album!,"For everyone wanting to buy this album: buy the UK edition!! The US release has left off one of the best songs ""Addicted"", while the original UK edition has kept the integrity of the album as it was supposed to be. Ordering through Amazon.uk is as easy as ordering from the US site. Just go there and sign in. Shop as usual."
3,Amy Winehouse,"Having to go thru rotator cuff rehabilitation, the hit ""Rehab"" resonates. Although it applies to alcohol abuse, I don't want to go to rehab either! One or two hits. Otherwise, neutral."
5,This review is for the vinyl version of Back to Black,"In the past I have not had good luck with vinyl from Amazon, they were often warped from improper storage and packing. Well I think Amazon finally got the hint. This was packed properly and of good quality. I still cleaned it before playing it, as I always do with new albums.As far as the music? I think it is fantastic, great rhythms, great voice. The production and mastering are good too. Her jazz influence shines through."
3,Not quite the real deal,"If you like this album, check out Sharon Jones. She's the regular singer with the Dap-Kings, who were the backup band Ms Winehouse borrowed for this album. Sorry, but Sharon kicks Amy's @$$. To sing Soul, you gotta have it."
3,Great Retail Music,"This is great retail music. This makes we want to shop. They should play it at the Gap, except maybe they wouldn't like the drug references and (on this version) the bad words."
1,"Great music, poor recording","Amy's retro-style music is refreshing and her voice is a revelation. So what a disappointment when I finally bought this CD and put it in my stereo. The sound quality is an absolute disgrace. Every next time I listen to this CD, it causes my toes to curl more.Don't buy this CD, even if (or should I say 'especially if'?) you like her music. Some decent quality recording hopefully will be issued in the near future. I then can throw away this crap."
3,The usual UK hype,"It's not a bad album, but it is not that great either. It is a case of the usual UK music industry last-new-thing hype, like we've seen so many times before. Amy sings along in her husky voice, trying to sound like she's straight out of Brooklyn, though she's not. The tunes are catchy, but the lyrics are horrible nonsense (""didn't get a lot in class//but I know it don't come in a shot glass"", etc, etc.) The songs are all about her seemingly miserable life, but she lets across little sincerity or true emotion. Let's hope she finds some of that for her next album, and if not, that she actually goes into rehab and gets her life sorted. Oh yeah, the studio should find someone good to write and arrange some better songs for her in the future."
3,"If you like to sing, you'll like this CD","I love driving in my car and cranking up this CD. If you like to sing along with female artists from Fionna Apple and Tori Amos to Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaghn, you will enjoy singing along to this one too. The songs from this CD you might hear on the radio right now, are the catchiest ones on there, but I would say they are definitely not the best. If I could, I would give this album 3.5 stars instead of just 3."
2,Terrible production,"Terrible production mars an otherwise good album. Highly compressed music falling victim to the ""louder is better"" philosophy and breaking up into obvious static in the high frequencies is immediately apparent on anything but lower quality audio systems. Some claim this was an attempt to achieve a ""retro"" or ""vinyl"" sound, but all it did was make the album unlistenable on better stereo and headphone systems. A shame."
5,Brilliant!,"This recording is perfect from start to finish, as is typical of her oeuvre. From tiny personal details like crying on the kitchen floor to sweeping observations about addiction, betrayal and love, this record shows us how it's done in rock-n-rhythm-n-blues (or whichever category you select for her work.) Add her expressive and impressive voice and you have pure platinum-gold-diamond perfection. Yes, boys and girls, Ms. Winehouse used some bad words, but never capriciously; when she uses the ""f"" word, she needs to; there are many euphemisms for sex (which she suggests but had the lyric capacity to never state), but she knew that sometimes the f-word speaks of much more than that.So, kids, buy this record and find out how it's done. The obscene part of this work is that some people don't get it."
2,Not such a,"THIS REVIEW DEALS ONLY WITH THE EDITING OF CURSE WORDS FOR THE CLEAN ALBUM.I bought the clean version of this album because she uses the ""f"" word in several songs on the other version and I have young children. The edited version is a disappointment. The curse words are clumsily half-blotted out, leaving an awkward space in the songs, while the phrase, ""You don't mean [...] to me"" remains untouched. I will still have to press the skip button, which negates the whole point of buying a clean version! If the Black Eyed Peas and Jay-Z can come up with alternate lyrics for some of their edited songs, then certainly Amy Winehouse's handlers could have done the same."
4,Amy's Music,"Short version: I spent money on this album twice (I lost my orginal copy). That is how much I liked it.Long version: The content and style Amy has is great. I do have a bias though. I have seen Amy recently in concert on TV. If I have one complaint is the fact that she mumbles through some of the lyrics. That takes away from the music in my opinion. Now that we have that part out of the way, Back to Black is a brilliant body of work.Amy Winehouse is a throw back the people like Etta James and then mix it Johnny Rotten. She is raw and powerful. She may be the most rock n' roll chick I have seen in a long time. I hope she is not all Courtney Love (i.e. self destructive). There is a fire burning inside of her, and I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next. I think boredom will prevent this artist from giving us just another repeat performance.Kevin"
4,Jazz for those that don't like Jazz,"Love this cd! Very soulful, jazzy, urban, funky...she covers it all! There is even a 70s rollerskating feel to a few songs. Amy Winehouse is good stuff. Buy now!"
5,Flawless renditions of timeless tunes,"Not a fan of Rittenour's fusion music, I was astounded to hear his rendition of Stolen Moments on the radio. This tune, and the rest of the album, is a great example of the finest of today's instrumental perfectionists, playing some great tunes of the heyday of jazz, with production values pleasing to both jazz aesthetes and casual listeners.The tunes are recorded straight and clean without overdubbing. Unlike many direct-to-disc recordings, the playing is unrestrained, yet it achieves the perfection one expects from overdubbed construction. Best of all, these guys really groove together.A nice range of styles and tempos, from the sultry Blue In Green and reflective Haunted Heart, to the lively Uptown and the strident St. Barts. Certainly not ""ear candy"", but still very pleasing, and therefore an excellent album to help guide one into the deeper waters of jazz. And the rendition of Stolen Moments is a must-listen to any serious jazz afficionado."
1,"If I had the money, I'd buy all of her records and burn them","Laura León sucks... there's no other way to describe this woman's music (if we can call it music). She simply destroys cumbia, salsa, and every other ""tropical"" style at hand. I'm ashamed to think that she's mexican, just like me. Her voice... man, her voice. Ever heard a sheep in heat sing? Buy this cd, and you'll have a pretty close idea. She became very popular in the early 1990's, mostly because she played a leading role in a cheessy soap opera (the leading man, was, by the way, Erik Estrada - Remember CHIP's?). If you buy this cd, those will be the worst spent 14 bucks of your entire life."
4,El antiguo Pacto...y el de ahora!,"No hay nada que ya no se haya dicho acerca de la calidad musical de las canciones de Marcos. Es siempre impresionante. La particularidad de esta produccion es que nos lleva a un recorrido a traves del Templo y el Lugar Santisimo, tal como lo construyo Salomon. Su significancia y enriquecedora para la vida cristiana."
3,My opinion...,"I am 12... and I think Marcos Witt is nothing but a great seller... but not God's minister.... there is a BIG diference between those... anyway... I like the song Aleluya... they sing it at my church and I like it... and it comes from ""Dios de Pactos"""
5,"Rasputin, Misunderstood Creature",Rasputin was not a monster.He was a cool cat with an even cooler beard.He was a holy man and healer.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
1,"I didn't buy this, and here's why . . .",". . . after looking at an Amazon ""sample"" (one of the good things Amazon does), just a few pages showed this offering to be so crammed full of superlatives, hyperbole, romantic fantasy, and author's license that one just knew it would be a waste of time, as misguided as was its writer."
4,Highly Detailed Account,"This book filled in many blanks that I had about the end of the Tsars. My only criticism is that it also provided much detail, such as several pages on jewelry, that I found of little interest."
3,Nicholas & Alexandra,I got bored...haven't finished it yet. Plan on doing so in the near future. Read Catherine the Great just before this...
5,A delightful account of Russia's last Imperial Family,"Robert K. Massie's account of the last days of tsarist Russia is intelligently written. Even if one is not historically inclined, one will automatically find onself drawn to this tragic tale. The book is so desciptive that one is almost lead to believe that Massie himself witnessed every event. If I must add any criticism of the book, it would be that Massie overestimates the the influence that Rasputin had on the fall of the Imperial government. It is true that Rasputin helped hasten the government's downfall , but it would have fell nonetheless due its subjection to a weak ruler and his neurotic wife. In all fairness, I must say that this minor point is not enough to dissuade me from giving it five stars. It is a must read for all those who love history, especially Russian history!"
5,Excellent,"This is the second book I've read by Robert Massie - the first one was Catherine the Great. He is a great writer. Takes one back to history, while providing the intrigue of a fictional story. Highly recommend."
4,Interesting History,"A friend who knows I am not the biggest history fan suggested I read historical biographies by Massie. Accuracy of history and the facts were always a drudge in school, but this is a fun way to learn history. Massie, whenever possible, uses quotes from the characters allowing the reader to see what's on the page as something real and not just a historical fact. I bought other Massie books and am looking forward to reading them all."
5,Unbelievable,"This book was suggested to me by a friend at a dinner party. As Russian history is not my typical area of interest, I had no idea what to expect. Little did I know.... This book is absolutely FANTASTIC. It reads quickly and clearly and has escorted me into further research on these figures and times. Not only is it a painfully incredible piece of history, it is an account of human fragility resulting in epic consequences."
5,One of the Best Non-Fiction Stories I Have Ever Read!,"Excellent story from begining to end! I was very interested in reading about the entire saga...learning about the Romanovs, the history and status quo at the time of Russia, what led up to the revolution and the whole entire tragedy,Once I set down to read it, I continued to read for hours, and hated to put the book down!Massie is a very good writer who knows how to put together an enthralling and interesting narrative that keeps the reader pondering about the tragic lives and ending of the Romanovs, and what led up to their demise, well after the reader has finished the book: )I will definitely pull this book out and read it again sometime."
5,Nicholas and Alexandra,This book is an excellent and detailed history of the fall of the reign of the czar. Also Massie's book on Catherine the Great is excellent.
5,This is superb reading. Robert K. Massie is a genius!!!!!!,"I have had a fascination for the Romanovs for a long time. Mr. Massie has produced an incredible work that captures all the tragedy of the Romanovs and thier ill-fated dynasty. It was fascinating, meticulously accurate and I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"
5,Massie brings one of history's greatest dramas to life!!!,"Robert Massie writes a comprehensive account of the events leading up to the 1917 Revolution, bringing the various enigmatic membersof the royal family to life. His exploration of Gregory Rasputin's rise to preeminence in the imperial household is especiallygripping, if not incredibly disheartening. As always, Massie has a unique knack for bringinghistory to life through vivid descriptions and a very readable style."
5,Massie brings life warmth and romance to a tragic figure,"More than a history of a man and a period the love andfamily intrigue of Nicholas and Alexandra brings a humanface to an autocrat. Tzar Nicholas variously described as""bloody"" and ""aloof"" faces the reader as possibly a weakman, but a loving husband and a devoted father. It is infact, this humanity of Nicholas that defeats him in hisdealings with political demands he is ill prepared tohandle. Brought up as an autocrat by a domineering fatherhe is in contrast a self effacing gentle man who can notdeal with the ruthless forces of revolution that sweep himaway."
1,Nicholas and Alexandra,Title: Nicholas and AlexandraThis was an awful boring book. I feel that it was a waste of my money and I will never buy anything written by Robert Massie again.
1,Nicholas & Alexandra,This book has such small printing that it is unreadable. I can't imagine Amazon letting this go on. I wound up getting the Kindle edition. Do not get the mass market edition.
1,The book does not do justice to the complexity of this story,"Massie represents the one of the worst tendencies in popular historical writing, namely the sacrifice of historical complexity in order to tell a pleasing story. Massie completely romanticizes the Romanov story, without devoting nearly enough attention to the fact that at the same time that the family was enjoying their time together in splendour, everyday Russians were suffering and dying as a result of their policies. The fact that some peasants may have been awed by the czar and his family does not tell the full story of the Romanovs' relationship to their subjects. There is a fascinating and complex story here; sadly, it is one that Massie neglects, choosing to make us feel ""like we were really there"" rather than giving any sense of the significance(s) of what he depicts."
3,long and slow at points,Historically accurrate I loved the parts abpout the family but the sections about the war were long and boring to read
4,A Good History Of The Last Romanovs,"While I disagree with the somewhat neo-monarchist views of Mr. Robert K. Massie, I will admit that his book holds a particular amount of merit for any Romanov enthusiast. Mr. Massie is an expert at crafting a historical piece of literature, into a pleasing story for anyone, and he does so here with startling effect. While I may disagree with Mr. Massie's sympathetic views I give Nicholas and Alexandra a ""thumbs up"" for the fantastic prose, and enduring image of the royal couple."
5,Great education,"I just love this author. I knew nothing about Russian History and have never been drawn to reading history. This was a page turner. It has led me to read Peter the Great and I am sure I will get to Catherine the Great as well. The skill of Robert Massie draws the reader in so that history comes alive. It is far from dry, which was my fear. I am now so interested in Russian History that my husband and I are planning a trip there this summer. Thank you Robert K. Massie."
5,unforgettable,"I knew extremely little about the Romanov's before beginning to read this book. A passing mention in another book I was reading made me want to know more, and this is the book I chose. I was a little apprehensive when I first got it. Its a good sized book, and I wondered if it would be able to hold my attention.I could not put it down!This book brings these people from a far-off land and a far-off time into your heart. It has made me feel as if I almost knew them.The violence and injustice done to them is hard to read or think about.I have a feeling this one is going to stay with me for a long, long time."
4,Good book,"Fort was a very interesting man and and his investigations are even more so. I recommend this to anyone interested in the unusual and peculiar. Rain falling from a clear sky. Reported mermaids, Raining frogs....etc."
1,FAIL just kidding!,this book is awesome i am reading it right now. i will read and reread it for the rest of my lif!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,DEMURE DELIVERY ON LUKEWARM ALBUM,"Although I love the work of Joan Baez, I'm not so sure of this album. It lacks the passion of her 60s and 70s work, and seems to be an attempt to marry her ""art-singer"" style of the 1980s with her earlier political consciousness. As such, it doesn't work. I like her interpretation of the Johnny Clegg song Asimbonanga (Zulu for ""We haven't seen him"") and her version of Peter Gabriel's ""Biko,"" whilst her own composition ""Recently"" is competent enough. As for the rest, the singing is good but the album lacks some spark somehow. I disagree with the other reviewer: I think Joan Baez has made many classic albums besides ""Come From The Shadows,"" like ""Farewell Angelina"", ""From Every Stage"", ""Diamonds & Rust"", ""Any Day Now"", ""Gracias A La Vida"" and many more."
1,Beware !!!! Make sure you read this before you order,"If you plan to keep the phone and contract, it should be good.AT & T would start billing from the day you order even before the phone arrives in your hand and the number switching does not work at all. They automatically assign numbers and start billing on that.Also, if you return it back to amazon make sure you call up AT & T as well to cancel your line. I learnt this the hard way and had to pay up 120$ since i never called at & t and they send me a bill after 2 months..."
3,Guide Encouraged Me To Boil Neighborhood Children In Pots!,"Not really :). I don't even know what this was, but it is preventing me from reviewing other things, so I am writing a little review about it, saying that it is nice, and I would like to have it over again for another visit :)."
3,i don't even know what i'm reviewing,i'm just reviewing this because its on the list= i'm not even sure what it is. three stars sounds fair.
3,Junk?,"It would have been better if it gave us info on what to do if the phone is not activated, what numbers to call, account # etc..."
3,Went to the trash right away,"Like others before me have said, this is just a piece of paper. I could care less about it, especially when I have a new, fun gadget like a cellphone to play with; paper went straight to the trashcan."
3,"uhhhh it's an insert, what's it supposed to be rated for??","I don't understand why they want me to rate this insert, but hey I guess it was good. although it made it as far as the edge of the box then back in to the box all the way till the box was trashed."
2,almost good,"It is very obvious to the reader that this is Anya Seton's first book. There are indications here that she will eventually by a wonderful writer, but I would not qualify this as a wonderful book. It drags, it meanders, and occasionally it restates itself. The reader feels sympathy for the main character at first, but after about 100 pages of ""pity poor Theodosia,"" it gets a little old. In the end, instead of sympathy, I felt only a kind of disgusted pity for a very pathetic character. This is really too bad, because in the beginning Seton creates a very strong, interesting character, then begins to whittle away her good qualities. I especially liked the parts about Alexander Hamilton and his conflicts with Aaron Burr. Historically, this is a very interesting novel. Romantically, not so much. There are streaks of a compelling story, but if you want a really good Seton book, read Katherine or Avalon or Devil Water."
5,A good read,This was a gift for a friend and she loved the story and also the history. She is lending it to everyone she knows.
2,"Ok book, terrible editing","Kindle should really make an effort to edit the older books. Looks like the book is just scanned and every page contains errors, mostly ""c"" for,""e""s- very distracting. Seems to be an ongoing problem with older kindle books."
4,A Great Resource for Teachers,"As a high school English teacher, I found ""Wild and Woolly"" both edifying and inspiring. After reading it with relish, I utilized the mandala ideas within a project with sophomores. The writing style is accessible and meaningful. It is a great, practical resource for teachers who write and who want kids to write more."
4,Great Item,"This is a great product. Looks good, and heats well. The only problem is the door is flimsy, so this item doesn't ship well. I received it twice, and the door was broken. I got my money back from the company, and contacted my local Ace store, and had one shipped to them instead. It was actually cheaper picking it up at the store also."
4,"NOT SURE YET, BUT SO FAR, IT'S GREAT","obviously, winter hasn't come yet. but it arrived in great condition and it works and looks great. time will tell if it can heat enough. one thing i'm not impressed with is the lack of a digital thermostat. i thought it had one on it. i would prefer to be able to set a temperature by degrees and let it cut on and off to keep that temperature in the home."
5,Awesome Fireplace,I purchased this electric fireplace from Scopestop.com. The original product had a scratch on top and was most likely damaged by FedX. I contacted Scopestop and explained the situation to Mike. He provided me with excellent customer service and immediately sent out a replacement unit. I received it today in flawless condition (even had a white glove on top). Just want to say purchase this product it looks and works as advertised. Thank you Scopestop for taking care of your customers!
2,Broken :^ (,"I would highly recommend this to someone I didn't like very well. It broke in to pieces within minutes of unloading it. However, I am giving it 2 stars because when I plugged it in it still looked pretty good besides being all cattywampus. It's going back though, and if I do get another one it won't be this model. I am giving my niece the smaller version(CS3311)for her apartment and it's pretty nice. I would go for it or the little Delonghi. Good luck in your quest for fire."
1,jim bruer couldnt save this,"as a jim bruer fan i tried this movie and hung in for the whole film but i cant recommend it,wasnt funny,wasnt interesting, nothing good about it hopefully everyone got experience and hopefully future collaborations will be improved..i recommend jim bruers recent concert dvds to rent on netflix or blockbuster.com"
5,Heartwrenchingly good!,"Josh and Amy were friends, but a rousing fight and the passage of time has left them with just childhood memories. Josh is trying to cope with a troubled, orphaned nephew, and Amy is trying to rebuild a life for herself and her daughter after walking away from a disastrous marriage. It's not the ideal time for either of them to rekindle their friendship, even a worse time to take it beyond friendship into an entirely new type of relationship. But love doesn't tend to wait for the right time.Four wounded souls come together and find not only healing, but a family in this wonderful second novel by Anna DeStefano!"
3,transitional overkill cd 50/50 some great /some what the f***!,"this cd come of as a trasitional piece and half baked songs.over kills done 10 better cds but then they have recorded worse too.this may be their comecial attempt but this cd has some classics but it also lacks drive and serious fury.good songs spirtiual void,weight of the world,world of hurt,i hear black but alot of this cd can be forgotten to easliy just put in horrorscope you'll have forgotten this except for spritual void the one true stand out track on this cd(still in their set list)bu the rest is weak."
3,Another Great Band Dumbs Down,"Around 1992, a disturbing trend hit the metal world. Inspired by grunge, and the death of the real Metallica, many great bands decided it was uncool to play guitar solos and more than one string on the guitar. Great bands have reduced themselves to playing one finger, one string grooves. This album is a prime example. Not a bad album, but this kind of playing has just become redundant. Skip this one and check out Horrorscope."
4,'I Hear Black' shows a good other side of OverKill,"This album was about 5 bucks when I bought it, so I thought I couldn't leave the store without getting it.'I Hear Black' was often criticized for being too ""grungy"" or not Thrash enough. Though I understand people saying that, I wouldn't say that it's a bad thing. The desperate Heavy Metal of 'World Of Hurt' and the ultra heavy blues of 'Spiritual Void' still are on the OverKill-set today, but the album has other great songs, take 'Dreaming In Columbian' or the sensitive 'Shades Of Grey' for instance.For the Thrash fans there still are songs like 'Weight Of The World', 'Just Like You' or the Sabbath-like 'Ignorance And Innocence' (which are all at the end of the album).'I Hear Black' is maybe not what many fans expected from it, but it's the most varied album they released."
5,One of OVERKILL's best!,"Anyone who has looked through my reviews knows that I own nearly every OVERKILL cd (plus a load of their LPs) and that I love this band.This is one of the OVERKILL cds that I have nearly warn out. I love all their music and their new one `Ironbound' is awesome; but this is a masterpiece. If I could give this CD a higher rating I would.Not every song has speed, but they don't need it; the awesome thick bass and driving-pounding shreds are out of this world. Have a listen to the sound samples of `I Hear Black', `Ghost Dance' and `Ignorance & Innocence' and you'll get an idea of what this cd is about. Perfect tempo, perfect production and perfect attitude to outstanding thrash.""The Big 4 of thrash are the best"" you say...? Yeah - directly below OVERKILL."
5,Great Metal Album! Totally.,"Now I can not say I'm super knowledgeable in the metal genre, but I love this album. There's awesome tempo, catchy melodies and rhythm and riffs, which is definitely different from the pure thrash where faster is better, but I think that just gets boring. This is a highly recommended album and I've tried the older Overkill albums and they are not nearly as good as this.Definitely a bargain! I first heard of Overkill from the Metal Massacre 5 CD and their song ""Soldier Boy"" was hot! This album has that similar feel and sound, I think."
3,horrorscope to this departure from trash formula,the high point of this cd is spiritual void hands down few of the other song grab you and hold your attention maybeworld of hurt and weight of the world bt the cd is full of midpaced song that are very different from all other overkill release past and even more modern overkill cds too.
1,...,"I love Overkill, but my dissapointment is imeasurable. This album has the guitars, the vocals and beats that made Overkill famous, yet it lacks the heart of good music. Simply put, it [reaks]. In hindsight, I should have known by the really cool cover art. In the metal word,saddly, the better your album cover the worse the music. This is a prime example. Buy this album if you need a nice silver sided coaster for your drinks. But do not let this this disc anywhere near your CD player!"
5,A nice repair part for an old kitchen sink,"I needed a new sink disposal for an old wall mount kitchen sink being used as a utility sink in the basement. The old disposal had completed rusted through and someone ""glued"" it together with caulking. The old one was 3"", which proved to be impossible to find wherever else I looked. This 2-7/8"" is close enough to work. The stopper is a nice edition. Although it was intended for a prep-sink, it is also prevents foreign matter associated with various household and cleaning projects from clogging the drain."
1,BEWARE !!!! FAKE!!!!,"I can't believe it! This is an iconic American hard hat..... Fail, cheap China made knock off lol for 65 bucks come on."
1,CTS Hits Rock Bottom,"This album is an insult to the memory of a once great band. Well to start with, it's not even a band at all at this point, just singer/songwriter John Palumbo with another guitarist. I don't even think there is a real drummer on it, sounds like a crummy machine you'd use for demo work.In fact the whole thing soundslike a bedroom songwriter demo. Well you can say that's a pretty cool effect, but that's not the case here, mostly because the songs are just plain dumb. CTS made great albums in the mid 70's, that featured great poduction, playing and orchestration. Seek out the self titled debut,Animal Notes,Safety In Numbers,Live Sky, and White Music if you want to check out what this band really was about. They still make lame,low budget albums (Raw was the beginning of ""the comeback"" after a long silence)but delight middle aged fans by playing their old favorites in clubs in the Baltimore area, where they are a legend."
2,Sad,"First of all I agree 100% with the review written by John Spokus, read it.The original Crack the Sky from West Virginia/Ohio now of Baltimore was just outstanding! The last great album with the exception ""Live at Recher Theatre"" was World in Motion after that it seems Crack the Sky lost direction and creativity. While Raw is fair at best their older material is the direction I point you to.This is SAD because of there excellent start as Rolling Stone rated there first album ""Best New Album and Artist"". Crack the Sky , what the heck happened to you?"
5,Hope for those with empty arms,"I received a review copy of this book after we lost our son prematurely (he was 23 1/2 weeks). We were given several loss resources which contained helpful and useful information on neonatal and infant loss. However, many were filled with depressive letters from parents and lacked a sense of hope. This book spoke to not only our broken hearts but also to our minds. It does not just provide sentiments to pick up your spirits, it brings comfort through bibical truths."
1,Own every MacArthur book but this one is thoroughly unbiblical,"I probably own every single MacArthur book and several copies of many. I even own the $400 commentary collection. When I read MacArthur, I expect for the most part, Biblical verses to be taken in context.However, when I read this book of his, I was floored at how many scriptures are torn completely out of context. MacArthur promoting (or at least extremely close to teaching) the Arminian false doctrine of Age of Accountability in this book. He speaks of innocent children. You can find his sermons on GTY that also mirror this same false teaching. He declares that children are innocent until an unknown age. And that ALL children are saved. The normal Biblical belief is that we can trust that elect children are saved. And we can rest in the hope that if they die early, our Christian children are saved. But the Bible teaches against all children being saved. King David speaks of being wicked from conception. We are born totally depraved."
1,Haven't read it........,My daughter passed away last October 27th. Just can't bring myself to read it yet. She has been gone less than a month.
5,Electonic Dub,"Dubtronic is mind-blowing. I love electronic dub and this is one of the best records I've bought. Things begin to heat up with the chill beats of 'boombox dub' and 'slice of the pie', which is one of the best tracks on the record. 'Drum & Bass in the Asylum' is a stand-out track that unlike most of the others is a little more upbeat and ampy. The beats and effects that the Professor mix are intriguing to say the least. Definitely one for the collection if you enjoy chill electronic dub."
5,Headover,"I have a pair of these stands, purchased them for a discount buy!!!. They are well design and sturdy for speakers up to 100lbs. Don,t need a drill to crank up your speaker , smooth lift guide, easy to setup. Great for only one person to setup. For the price. Great!!"
4,Pretty close to the book...,though Stanley is not at all how we pictured him. The adult character roles were a hoot. It was fun for my son and I to watch AFTER reading the book.
3,It's ok,It is a good dictionary but I wish it had the pronunciation of the words in it. I was a little disappointed.
5,ON THE NILE - DAT'S RIGHT!,"This is early stage techno / dance / purple rain influenced / Kraftwerk sound but still E.L. is unique unto his own style. I love it, but it may be too slow for some folks - really only 3 good songs on here. But you can't download it anywhere (My House ON The Nile) so you have to buy the CD. If you have any questions about it shoot me an email. It's a must in your ""Old School"" library. I tried to find out what happened to E.L. but not much info after 1993..."
4,Good Pump,"I purchased this pump and am pleased with the performance. Unlike the series of negative reviews that I read, I had no trouble attaching the pump to my presta valve. The pump worked well and there was hardly any pressure loss after removing the pump from the valve. I too have the pump with a pressure gauge that will read to 160 psi."
1,More defects than you can shake a stick at,"The chuck doesn't form a good seal. Either the presta valve gets stuck in there, or it leaks while you are filling the tire.I weight 166 lbs. and I have to put my full body weight and use my triceps to pump my road bike tires. I have a Topeak and a Specialized pump and never work up a sweat.The lever for the chuck valve snaps back and smashes my --very bad word-- thumb.This pump is junk."
1,Mediocre pump,"It does pump air, but the gauge on it is so inaccurate as to be useless. I've tried many of these floor pumps, andthe Crank Brother's Easy Force Power Pump is my favorite by far. It's gauge is precisely accurate and it's worked well for years."
3,Waiting for his next to satisfy...,"Pip and Flinx lovers,like me, have been waiting for this book a long time, and perhaps they, like me, hope that the next book will return to the series tradition of adventure, mischief, and fast-paced fun. This novel followed Flinx on his usual quest to discover who he is, who his parents were, and what was done to him in utero to make him what he is. This is usually very interesting, but then it is also usually told along with a separate story, something fun and juicy. This book reads like an excerpt of a bigger novel. It doesn't really end in a way so that you feel you've finished the book. Hard to say since I know the back story, but I'm not sure it really stands alone. I did enjoy reading this book; it gave a lot of insight into Flinx's background and that's always fascinating. But I hope Foster's next Flinx novel has a little more meat."
3,"Decent, old-fashioned page turner","Why have I aged from a twelve year old kid when I first read Tar-Aiym Krang to thirty-seven while Flinx is only six years older? It doesn't seem fair... But anyhow, this continuing adventure of Pip and Flinx is typical old school sci-fi page turner stuff. The inside cover sites a Locus review that states that this book ""make(s) for a good read"". That's not exactly earth-shattering high praise, but it's fair and accurate. If Alan Dean Foster's writing didn't have a special nostalgic place in my heart, I would probably trash this book, but come on, it's Pip and Flinx - what's not to love?"
3,For fans only,"Reunion is certainly the weakest of the Pip and Flinx novels I've read. It starts well, with Flinx finding out that he's capable of being not-so-nice when necessary, but tends to fall into a one-thing-after-another novel as it progresses.This novel feels rather like a short story with filler. Pip and Flinx fans should certainly read it, as it develops Flinx's understanding of the Meliorare society and himself (although, as is traditional, it raises more questions). Besides, after such a long wait, anything will be a nice read. If you have never read a Pip and Flinx novel, however, *please* don't start with this one - you'll get entirely the wrong idea about this charming series."
2,Yet Another Pip & Flinx Book,"It's long-awaited, and it brings the agendas of the wide question of ""what is Flinx here for?"" another step forward.Unfortunately, it feels like something of a place-holder. It resolves very little, as far as the characters are concerned. Flinx figures out a _little_ more about his family, but that hardly seems to justify a whole novel. He explores an interesting planet, but it seems unlikely that the planet will be of continuing interest. The plants of Midworld apparently get in touch with some other aliens, but none of the characters in the book are aware of this in the slightest; in effect, the _real_ story in the story mostly takes place off-stage.It would have been nice to have some tension added in involving Flinx being reacquainted with some of the Church characters that we actually _liked_, as opposed to just the dysfunctional family members that are rather unlikable.Hopefully the next episode will come along sooner, and be a bit more satisfying."
2,Reunion: A Pip & Flinx Novel,"I am a Pip & Flinx fan from way, way back. I have all the other novels in the series and do enjoy rereading them periodically. I eagerly awaited my receipt of this one. I consider this to be a readable novel (I finished the whole thing), but it was not as good as I had hoped. I have noticed that this series is very mixed as far as quality is concerned. I think the idea has a great deal of potential that has never quite materialized. As I said, I enjoyed this novel, but it could have been much better. I was left feeling vaguely unsatisfied."
4,Flinx Flounders (just a bit),"Pip and Flinx. What's not to like?Foster has done his usual workmanlike job of spinning yet another yarn about the adventures of the two, but the story line is a bit thin. Just a bit. I got the feeling that it was forced; a matter of churning out another story in the series because fans demand it and it pays well.Yes, there's enough meat there to keep the fans happy, but some of the parts seem to be filler.BUT:Will I read it again? Yes.Do I want more? Definitely!"
1,Disappointed Greatly,"This book is by far the worst of the P&F series. I have all the other books and have read and reread them multiple times. Most of the book merely rehashes parts and themes from his other books and never manages to create any level of storytelling. The whole story is unsatisfying, especially the conclusion. I think that ADF has hit the wall with regard to the Commonwealth theme bacause all his recent books are very unimpressive. The sophistication and compelling plots are not present in the newer books. I highly recommend all his other P&F but stay as far as you can from this latest installment. I am seriously thinking of donating this book to the library."
2,Not Up To Standards,"I have read all of Foster's past Flinx novels, sometimes twice, and most of his other science fiction and fantasy offerings. This novel is not up to any of his other books, not even close, as if most of it were ghostwritten by someone who had only read his Mid-World, and proceeded from there to come up with 326 pages of sequel. I could not finish it. The plot is comic book, and the verse pallid. A Theasaurus seemed to be the author's major tool, as a few quotes illustrate sadly: (Page 80) ""Or comets, or a visitation from a perambulating nebula. Decorative simulacra of anyuthing in the universe were available for the asking."" (Page 92)""Unmonitored glowing consoles beckoned, efficient instrumentation silently declaimed reams of unperused information, and chairs reposed unoccupied."" If anything, I would rent it from a library."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This book is a complete waste of time. I'd hoped that the author would finally allow Flinx to discover the secrets of his background and his creation. Instead, the book can be summarized by the following: Flinx breaks into Computer Database on Earth to learn about his past; he finds nothing of interest except one file that mysteriously disappears; he follows the trail of the file; finds his sister in a mysterious alien vessel; loses his sister and the file he seeks; learns nothing of interest. What a joke."
2,Not the best in the series,"I've read all the books in this series, I'm used to Flinx loseing all of his abilities at the start of the next book. This book has plot holes and inconsistancies big enough to fly the Teacher through. It just seems thrown together quickly and not very well thought out. If your die hard Flinx fan like me you'll try to ignore the gapping holes and enjoy the story, if your not I wouldn't bother with it."
4,Flinx is Back,"One of the first Sci-Fi books I ever read was Flinx in Flux. Well the character is back and just as I remembered him. A little confused, intelligent and lucky enough to get caught in adeventure while trying to find himself.Slow at some points, but true to the series."
3,These books are turning into the X-Files,"Another Pip and Flinx novel. In Reunion Flinx is essentially grown up and is still searching for the reason for his existence (and understanding of his powers). He returns to Earth a using his powers befriends and tricks a woman so he can gain access to information about the Meliorare society who genetically enhanced him. Just as he is about to get the information he is looking for, it is stolen and he is forced to chase the thief across the galaxy. In the very surprising conclusion, a Tar Aim artifact is found as is Flinx's sister. Overall, I am getting pretty bored with Pip and Flinx. Come on Foster, throw us a bone here and let something actually happen. These books are turning into the X-Files, all hints at big things with no substance."
3,Not as good as it should be.,"Ok, I am a great Flinx and Commonwealth fan. I own all of the series, but I was disappointed with this book. I thought there was little character development, almost no expansion of our understanding of the commonwealth and a lot of contradictions from previous books, noteably the Tar-Aiym Krang. Without providing spoilers, I think this is a regertable effort in the commonwealth/Flinx universe."
1,Fosters worst book so far,The Flinx-novels are fun but the latest is very uninspired.There is nothing new to be learned about our hero.the whole action seems very coincidental.it reads like a first draft for a book.the ideas are not worked out and the writing is rather poor.
1,"I Used To Love Them, But It's All Over Now...","When this came out, it was a revelation to me. Listening to it now, after several years, well---it makes me feel ill. It's almost the same effect as ingesting way too much saccarine. Pass."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SCALE,"I had to return the first Soehnle scale I ordered due to the digital display not working at all. I ordered a replacement scale. The digital display worked on this one, but the glass top was mounted a little crooked compared to the feet of the unit. My wife wanted to return this scale as well, but this scale does seem to give a more accurate weight reading than our old scale. So I guess we will keep it for 30 days and then decide. Also, this scale was only engineered in Germany. It was actually made in the Czech Republic."
2,OMG!,"Looks nice enough, if only my average size, 3 year old (soon to be 4) nephew could wear the thing. It is sooooo small. Size chart says small will fit a waist 19""-22"" but if you lay the pants flat on table and measure they are only 7 inches wide at waist. The elastic is not very stretchy either. They are 15 1/2 inches long from top of waist band to bottom of pants. I am waiting on call from account manager at fanshopping. hopefully I can get a refund and maybe not have to pay another 10.00 shipping to send it back. Unless you are buying for a 18 month old it will not work."
3,It serves its purpose . . .,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. It's very convenient for those who own more than one guitar but don't really need the triplet stands. It holds both the electric and acoustic as it's supposed to, you just have to do a little maneuvering to keep the necks from hitting or the strings from getting smashed. Other than that, it's good quality and seems to be pretty sturdy."
5,Solid and does the job,"I use this guitar stand for a child's ""First Act"" acoustic guitar in the front, and a standard electric guitar in the back. It's perfectly solid and fine holding those items, and is handsome enough to display in my family room. I recommend this product."
4,Nice Stand but they tried too hard on the bars,"I like this stand, I have it holding a guitar and bass, it's easy to get to either and they feel solid when your put them on this stand. But they tried to hard with the bottom bars that hold the guitar the made it for an acoustic and didn't think about covering the top triangle brace completely so you can scratch the back of an electric guitar. Yet, that is the only flaw with this stand and I can live with that, they only lost one star for that issue."
1,Arrived broken,"I gave this as a gift and ordered it a month early. When we opened it an tried to put the guitars in one of the arms was broken. Amazon would take back since it had been over a month. Had to throw the broken thing away, beware."
4,Handy,This stand does help with the two guitars but it's not like one of the pictures posted on the site. I have an acoustic and an electric guitar and the guitar that sits in the front touches the neck of the one in the back. Besides this everything is fine.
3,With a slight design change it would be perfect.,"My only complaint with this product is the angle of the main upright. If it were vertical instead of leaning back, I think it would be much better. The opening in the back for the electric guitar is narrow and I've banged the guitar bridge on the upright a couple times. Also, the acoustic guitar leans back too far. I've toyed with the idea of trying to bend the main upright to vertical, but not sure if I can do that without ruining the whole thing. The product is pretty good as it is, but it would be perfect if I could make that one change."
4,"Good, but not convenient if you have an acoustic and an electric","The thing is, you can only put the acoustic guitar in the front. This makes retrieving and placing the electric one from and to the back somewhat inconvenient, depending on how much care you put on the guitar and how often you need to pick up the electric one. Overall, it's good. It does what it says."
4,Very different,Were all the grammar and mechanical errors for real or part of the book. I love this guy's imagination and would gladly read more of his books. This isn't the same old crap. And it doesn't have anything to do with dope.
1,It's Dope...If Dope means crap,"I recently finished reading this ""book"" and am so glad that I never ever have to read it again. This book reads as if it were written by a mentally deficient community college dropout who flunked all his English, Writing, and Literature classes. Still, despite the obvious lack of talent, he persevered and wrote a lackluster, unoriginal and mind numbingly horrific book that may in fact be the worst book ever to be published. Don't let the good reviews sway you, they are obviously written by the author to try to get people to buy this disaster of a book. No one with a logical and stable thought process would actually like this dribble.Buy Dope only if you run out of toilet paper."
4,Bill Syas OKay,"I got some Dope, read it and I dig it.The book is solid. And this guy obviously is too crazyto make sense out of anything....(talking about the author).You can tell he hates books...or something...but he's obviously missing some screws....(if you know what I mean).....I wrote a review about a movie the same guy did,the movie is pretty out there, and when I discovered Dope,you should pick it up, if you like stuff that goes against what a ""book"" should be like....check it out....."
1,WTF,"After reading the naseau inducing prose, and quickly realizing that there was no way I could have just spent 15 bucks on this garbage. The storyline is whack, character development is non-existent..... One question is every person who reviewed this book either related to the author or friends because there is no way Im the only person in America that thinks this book showed be renamed ""CRAP"""
4,I want more DOPE,"I just finished reading the book. By far one of the best books I've ever read. I don't exactly what the intent for the book was, but I will tell you that it goes everywhere and back within 100 ir so pages. I would have to say that anyone that's into philosophy or wants a really interesting read should pick this bad boy up A-SAP.Okay, for starters the book reveals a very intimate side of what our reality is and could be. The story puts faith in the readers ability to understand our daily life and we do with it and don't do with it. Frankl is by far one of the most inventive and crazy characters I've ever met. His obsession with the Naza Chambers are very near insanity and his obsessions to alcohol dismantle his reality. Pick up some Dope when you get a chance."
4,Perfect,"Dope is perfect. It has a mood of sophistication throughout the work. The characters are detailed to where they breathe in the pages. I haven't read a book this powerful in a long long time. Take a bow Robert J., this book is definitely a milestone in the world of stories. If you haven't read it, please do so, the book is awesome. But where's the synopsis on this page?Frankl is a delight,"
3,Made in China,"I bought this unit because the OTC website touts their products American heritage. They go on about all their American factories where they build their products. When I received this package, the very first thing I saw was the label that said ""Made in China"". It works well enough; I give it 5 stars for it's functionality. But if I'd known I was going to get Chinese built tools, I could have gotten them for HALF the price here on Amazon, and they would probably work just as well. So I'm dinging them 2 stars for misleading the public about where their products are made, and pricing it so high."
4,"Works well, looks nice, minor complaints","I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. However, I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example, I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect."
5,Great for beginners!,"I ordered the Kyser Capo and couldn't be happier!! I must admit that the PINK color was what ultimately won me over :). However, it is also extremely easy to attach/detach from your guitar. If you are a beginner like me, having the capo will make it easier to learn chords and excite you to learn much faster! I recommend it to everyone!"
4,Perfect for Changing Keys Instantly,"I have been using different capo but Kyser 6-String Capo is the best so far. It stays in place and does not make any of the strings muted when played. Changing keys is a breeze. I am able to even shift keys in the middle of a song. I've triedFender Accesories 099-0401-001 Smart Capo Electric Guitar Strap - Standardbut it was messy as it did not really clamp very well despite a very ""clever"" mechanism of clamping and unclamping as Fender claimed."
5,Perfect,"A very solid capo that can switch frets quickly, and is completely hassle free. Also very secure and holds the strings down tightly."
4,Loving this Capo,"Bought this capo for my jasmine takamine electric-acoustic. Works like a charm. Some capos are $20+ and people are willing to pay for it because the notion of ""you get what you paid for."" Don't be fooled by this reasonable price..it really IS a great capo. You can pay less without sacrificing quality. I would buy this capo again."
5,Works and looks great.,"First capo I've used, but I can't think of anything to criticize. The stars and stripes theme is done well. Paint was done nicely."
2,They break a lot!,I've owned a lot of these capos and every single one has broken in less than a year. Good luck collecting on the warranty... I never gotten my replacements. I moved to using an adjustable capo. Works well while it lasts but its not worth replacing it every three months or so.
5,Quick on and off,This capo is simple to use. It is very quickly placed on and off the neck with a snug fit to securely fret all the strings evenly. The colors is vivid and stays looking nice.
5,Perfect,"Love this capo. It's the perfect color, and it holds tight and doesn't slip. It's kinda hard for me to move at times it's so strong! LOve it!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Fine capo, except one huge flaw. The spring used in the capo is insanely strong. Presses the strings all the way to the fretboard, causing the guitar to go far too sharp for my tastes. I like the adjustable shubb better personally, wish I would have gotten that one instead."
5,great for playing live,"Fast, reliable and quality construction make this a great capo for live performances. Highly recommended."
5,radical!,"Never owned a capo before this one. A little worried about the rubber peice that holds the strings down wearing out, or becoming indented and staying that way. But what do I know. A piece of paper came in the package saying if it does wear out within a year I can get a new one for 5 bucks and if after a year its 10 bucks, so that's cool"
5,Beautiful piece,I chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons. It is lovely. Clear shard silk screening. The capo itself is really good. It is very snug on the strings.
5,great finish and a great product,at first i was kinda hesitant about buying such a cheap product that maybe the capo wouldnt clam down on the strings tight enough but i was wrong the capo worked great
4,Does what it's suppose to,My gold capo is very pretty and handy. I haven't really used it yet but I've tried it out a bit and it holds down the strings like its suppose to. The only problem is its really tight and not very easy to get on and off without fear of pulling out a string or two. It takes a really strong hand to unclamp it but overall a good capo. Just keep the warranty card in the packaging and follow the recommended care instructions to keep it like new.
5,Great Capo,"Very good capo, been using them for years. Just don't drop this one in the grass, you may not find it! Pretty neat."
5,2nd one,"This is my second Kyser capo. I love my first one as in it's solid, dependable and tight and also a great price. I bought this one for my brother who is learning guitar and wanted a capo but wasn't sure which one to buy. Don't get fooled into buying over-priced $40-$50 ones. Kysers are perfect in their quality and price point. (Plus I love this one in Camo!)"
5,Handy little item,"This capo is very nice. Heck, it's pink! I couldn't ask for anything more! I think it's grip is perfect, not too tight, not too loose. It's fairly easy to open and close and makes those strings sing wonderfully. Love it!"
2,Bad Springs,"I have used kysers for 10 years and as the years have progressed, I'm starting to realize the springs on these can lose tension fairly quick. This may be the last kyser I will buy. They will work for some people but I use mine a lot and with taking the capo on and off, the springs wear out.Also, they mess the tuning up on my guitars. I am moving to G7's for acoustic and Planet Waves for electric."
4,"Easy to Use, But Other Capos Better","I used this capo for about six months, and it has worked well for me. I found it easy to move around (it is slightly on the hard to press side, but doable), and it covers all the strings well. It is slightly harder to use than a capo that I bought later, however."
5,Great Capo,"I looked at many capos but chose this capo for 2 reasons.1. the cost of the capo, it was one of the cheapst capos that I had looked at.2. I had heard of Kyser as being one of the best brands outthere. I was not disipointedwhen I got this product i have used it everytime that I play.if you are looking for a great capo at a cheap cost this is the one for you."
5,Convenience won,"Long time Shubb user, but decided to try something different.I think I've found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations, e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room, maybe a table or the floor in some other places, for the Shubb."
5,Good deal,"The product got here within shipping date, good condition. Now my capo is distinguished from all the other guitar players in my church. Plus it helps a good cause."
4,Just what I ordered,The capo was exactly what I wanted and just what I ordered. I love the pink...perfect for the girl in me.
5,good stuff!,i was stuck in a world of normal tunes before i purchased this product. i couldntt believe the opertunities for new songs this item opened up for me. i absolutly love it. it is a very sturdy built piece and imm glad i got it.
4,Everyone can use and extra hand.,"Ok, I will admit I am not a musician, but a I do play the guitar everyday just to get better at it. I got sick of the same sound I got every time I played it. This particular Capo brand was recommended to me by my musician friend. What a great addition to to my hobby. Now I hit different notes using pretty much the same chords I used without the capo.I would strongly recommend it to any one who is starting to play the guitar since it can be very disappointing when you get stuck hitting the same sound.By the way, this is a great brand. The capo is very well made and very classy looking and very easy to use. Remember, my musician friend recommended this for me and he is being playing for years and in a band."
5,Works as advertised,Works on my electric with no issues. Easy to install and padding adequately protects guitar from damage. Have not tried with acoustic.
5,Excellent!!,I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets. I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap $5 capo before. This is well worth your pay :)
5,love it!,"this capo is perfect. i love the pink, it goes perfectly with the color of my guitar. it holds the strings down nice and strong, absolutely no buzz. its easy to open too. stop reading and get it already. ( and btw its $21 at Guitar Center, and they don't have the pink)"
1,totally different from the ones in the picture,"The picture shows a straight finish (appearance). They gave me the wavy appearance of the capo. although it doesn't matter how it looks like, but i really wanted the ones that looks simple. Definitely, I'll return this product. This picture should be changed so that no other people are fooled."
3,does it work,"It is hard to clip but once you get it on the guitar, it does it work.I feel it's going to break sooner than I would expected."
5,great product great price,"The Capo was in excellent condition when it arrived, it came in a timely matter, and the price was just right. Thanks!"
3,Bit Disapointed,"I was sooooo excited for this, i mean hello its pink! perfect for my black guitar. It works just fine so far. Only thing ive noticed however, is it seems to poorly made, im worried about the rubber more than the spring. But my biggest complaint, is theyres marks where theres no pink, like ""mistakes"", and theyres not just one, but on mine theyre were a couple. I wouldve been fine if my first capo wouldve broken after a couple of months, but it couldve atleast LOOKED perfect for what i payed for it, i wouldve request a refund and payed the rest for a g7 instead if i didnt already have it and need it for the song im working on. So if your looking for something pink and for a beginner, itll do the job no prob, but if u want something professional, i wouldnt say this is for you."
3,Not what is in the picture,I returned this capo because it was way different than the one in the picture. The one I received had ridges and was wavy when the one in the picture is smooth. As far as performance it is great but they got the appearance wrong
4,Great product,"i am new to playing guitar and didnt know what was a good capo. but i made the right choice great product, works very well."
5,Very Good,"This is a great capo, lightweight yet durable. I like to transpose in drop D tuning, because I have a lower voice, and this thing does the trick. Just make sure you line it up directly next to the frets, and you shouldn't get any sort of buzz, regardless of what kind of tuning you use. Great product."
5,perfect,"all I can say is that this capo is the one which works for beginners and pros ,,,,,it`s really awesome ...dont ever hesitate to buy it ....enjoy"
4,Pretty good.,It works well on steel string guitars. Classical guitars...not so much. But overall it's a pretty good capo. It's really tight.
4,easy to use & beautiful,"Like this camo capo's simplicity and its unique color. My friend got a new one after seeing me using it, but his is a bit shorter than mine. Mine works both uke & acoustic guitar, I have no problem to use it on single hand. As the manufactor suggests for its duration, I don't clip it on the guitar when it's not in use. :)"
4,decent capo,i liked this capo as a temp until i got one of those latch down ones. i found that this capo threw my guitar too far out of tune for my style of playing but then again i am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my guitar music. the spring is very strong so it will accommodate heavy strings on a guitar. if you are not too serious about playing guitar the spring snap capos are for you but if you want your guitar to stay in tune after you attach the capo get yourself a hinged snap on capo.
4,Quickest changing capo,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos. Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use. The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension. Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time. Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
3,Good short-term capo,"The Kyser Classical capo was the first quality capo I ever purchased. It lasted me over a year, until the long metal extension of the spring suddenly snapped. I purchased another one, (I couldn't find my warranty card. They used to offer a lifetime warranty but later reduced it to a year.) and haven't had the same experience with it. My original one was generally very sturdy, but after only a month or two, the newer revision doesn't hold the strings nearly as well. I now get a lot of rattle. Because of this apparent change in design, I'm in the market for a new capo."
5,Looks and Works Great,"I'm a beginner guitar player, so I was looking for a decent capo at a decent price so I could add some more songs to my repertoire. Before this one, I had ordered the Kyser Pro/Am 6-String Guitar Capo. The reviews on it were good and they said it was easy to take on and off, but I hated it. It was really difficult for me to get a good sound on it, it just wouldn't tighten enough.This one is great though. It's easy to put on and take off, and holds all six strings down without a hitch, delivering a nice even tone, without the ""buzz"" you sometimes get when the strings aren't held down hard enough. You can just leave it on the head when you're not using it, and then just clip it on when you want to play with it on.It also looks sleek and classy, with the all black design, which is always a plus for me. All in all, a great buy and I highly recommend it for anyone beginning to play guitar or unhappy with their current capo."
5,Love it!,"I got this as my first Capo. I made sure to get the pink one, so none of my roommates ever steal it! It's easy to move, and looks awesome. I love it!"
5,Best value out there,Great value. No need to buy a more expensive capo. This one performs just as well and at cost fraction of most. Highly recomended.
3,Capo,"Item works but not long enough to cover the fret. Unfortunately, I did not know size that would be appropriate for my need. Good quality but not right tool."
4,It is pretty good,"I really like how it looks like. But there is unexpected sound which is caused by friction. Overall, it worth this price and it is really a nice product"
5,Great capo!,"Never used a capo before, but this one is easy to use and works great! great price, also."
5,Trolls are beautyful,"This book is one of the better ""how-to"" bools I have ever seen. It is a book that belongs in any artists library, beginners, advanced, rosemalers or carvers. I own one and have used some as gifts. You learn about brushes, and how and when to use them. You learn about paint, and how to mix them. And a big plus, you can even learn some norwegian; it is written in both eng. and norw."
4,Cheaper Elsewhere,"Great book for my wife who loves to Rosemal! But, a week later I found it MUCH cheaper online elsewhere."
5,Chicago Blues Rock at its best...God Bless Hounddog Taylor!!!,"Raw, re0.They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Of course, that could be said about many artists who have come and gone. Real, raw and as genuine as they come. Pure feel, great rhythm section as whole band. Humor, drama, fun...What more do you want???"
2,Flat studio recording of an energetic live bluesmaster,"Hound Dog Taylor needs to be experienced ""live"" or through a live recording. His overdistored guitar needs to be heard bouncing off the back wall of a blues club rather than on a dry studio recording. It sounds like the studio recorded Hound Dog at 130db, used a typical flabby 60's/70's bass guitar at normal room volumes, then mixed in the drums later. It just doesn't all come together like on the ""Have Some Fun"" album. It doesn't have the raw edge on it that makes Hound Dog so fun to listen to."
3,"Good info, but poorly organized.","I received the book quickly. Upon opening the package I was a little disappointed in the overall size and content of it. The book has good information in it, but it seemed scattered and in no particular order at all. Sometimes it was a little hard to make sense of. I did read the whole thing in one night, and have to say it does open your eyes to the fact they could have staged the whole thing right in Nevada. Good book, but needed to be more organized and written, and less like a note pad."
1,A special kind of crazy,"A friend gave me this book as an apparent joke. The logic is so dis-jointed, I worried about every stranger I came across for two weeks after reading it."
2,Interesting but weak,Contains some interesting photos and narrative but I felt the book did not present a compelling case. The author seemed to wander into material not really related to the issue cncerning the authenticity of the moon missions.
5,Even Carl Sagan knew it was a hoax,The late great Carl Sagan - America's most famous and popular Astronomer ever - knew that the alleged Apollo missions were a hoax.Too honest a man to ever promote the lie - note how in his lifetime he never mentioned it - he stated in one of his last interviews that it was basically a cold war exercise.He stated in the same interview that his favourite NASA space travel missions of all were the Viking landings on Mars.
2,JUST ONE QUESTION,"Can ANYBODY please answer this? In the photo of the moon walk, HOW CAN THE U.S. FLAG ""WAVE"" IN THE WIND? SERIOUSLY, I WANT TO KNOW. PLEASE"
3,Moon Hoax,"I rated this book 3 stars because although it's very interesting, the presentation is a bit simple. The pictures are blurred and unclear but the information is certain and professionally explained.The author, Bill Kaysing is very familiar with his subject and has researched it thoroughly.I have believed for a long time now that we never went to the moon, this book is certainly confirmation."
1,Only for those interested in the fringe,"This is just the first of a number of books that are a supposed ""Moongate"" expose. Yes, we went to the Moon, human beings can survive outside the gravity of the Earth, the flags on the Moon appear to ""wave"" because they're lined on the inside with wires, and all the supposed ""photo tricks"" can be easily explained. This is worth buying only if you want to do some research on fringe beliefs. Otherwise, check out badastronomy.com for a complete and researched debunking of these claims. I read that Mr. Kaysing passed away in 2005. It's a shame that he devoted so much time and effort on something as frivilous as this."
1,This man is out of this world,This book is so full of illogical reasoning that I am ashamed that I actually spent money on it. A better pick would be the book Bad Astronomy.
1,those who say it didn't happen,"So I guess there are actually 4 kinds of people: Those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, those who wonder what happened, and those who say it didn't happen. Sad.I suppose if we eventually manage to colonize Mars there will be millions of people on earth who won't know or won't believe that there are human beings living off-planet.I can understand why people don't want to believe that an atrocity like the Holocaust happened... but I can't fathom why people would want to believe that the moon landing, one of the most positive and spectacular human achievements since we started walking upright, was a hoax. Maybe it's a form of species self-loathing -- it would also explain why people would want to attribute other monumental achievements (language, the pyramids, etc.) to alien intervention.Like George Carlin says - Napalm & Silly Putty. We are capable of an extraordinary range of things.Ad astra, fellow travelers."
1,"Insulting, idiotic diatribe","This book reveals a profound misunderstanding of science, technology, politics, and human nature. Its arguments are specious and easily demolished by anyone with a slight understanding of reality. The book constitutes a grave insult to the many thousands who devoted a big part of their lives to the Apollo program."
1,Not Convinced,"I was ready to give this treatise a fair shake at proving that we did not go to the moon. I found it confusing and not very well presented as science, but as an attempt to convince not prove. Mr. Kaysing did not hit the nail on the head. The most credible part may have been that the ground underneath the space vehicle was undisturbed, not showing evidence that it had landed, but was placed there. His notion was that the vehicle would have made more of an impression in the soil at the landing site. He thinks the whole thing was simulated in the desert of Nevada and that the astronauts went to Las Vegas for recreation during the project."
1,"A ""Red-herring""","AKA: Wild Goose ChaseI purchased this book to learn more about the possible evidence showing that the U.S.A. did not go to the moon. What I got instead was a flimsy book with little to no research in it with terrible black and white photos which look like copies of the actual photos. One of those ""photos"" is of some Las Vegas casino security person watching gamblers playing at a table below with his binoculars. Another photo is of Las Vegas dancers. Hello??? WTF?!Bottom line: Avoid this book in your search for the truth. It contains just enough info to entice you but then ruins it all with it's ridiculous stories of astronaunts partying in Las Vegas.I have since learned that the best book on this subject is- Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers. And there is also a DVD sold seperatly.Go forth in your quest for truth."
5,Golden Classics:: The Friends of Distinction,"The Friends of Distinction were a group that paved the way fromsoul into pop & jazz, without sacrificing soul. They were a transitional group that has not received the credit they deserve. They were followed by the Fifth Dimension which continued the pop,rock,soul,jazz transmutation in music. The Fifth Dimension received popularity & accolades, however the 'Friends' should NOT be dismissed. Their harmonies & musical styleshould be noted! I love the 'Friends of Distinction' & the Fifth Dimension - the groups are similar. Check out the 'Friends' & you willhear what I mean. I actually performed: ""Love Or Let Me Be Lonely"" in a College Jazz/Pop group! ""Going in Circles"" is another great 'Friends' song. - Penny Music MAma"
3,Pop-laden heavy hard rock from Chicago band.,"Although the title track is of exemplary quality, the rest of the songs are a bit spotty and show that the instrumentalists are capable, but not always imaginative. Buy it if you are a fan, but you may be disappointed if you are not."
5,Survivor,"This CD is great. The title song is the first one. I had never heard the other songs before, but they are all great."
5,The One That Really Matters,"When I discovered My copy of EOTT was missing on CD, I knew I had to replace it. When I saw there was a 24 bit K2 remastered version that had been released, I was excited....until I saw the price. But I figured I grew up with this album in it's vinyl format, so no price was too big to replace it. This CD is amazing. Flawless. Perfect. No hiss from the previous versions on CD. I was expecting great things for the price. They were all granted. Listen to 'I'm Not That Man Anymore'. When it fades out, there is silence. There is silence during the piano solo. If you love this album, and, have the means, spend the money. Don't rely on 'reissued' versions, this is worth the price."
4,satisfied,"The CD shipped faster than expected. It was extremely well packaged. It arrived in perfect condition. It was a little expensive, but I had agreed to the price beforehand. I am pleased with the purchase."
4,Astonishing album,"ery solid hard rock album by Survivor. Unfortunately, the became marke by only the song ""Eye of the tiger"", while there are plenty of good songs in the album. The singer is very good. But the first five songs are really better than the rest."
3,Pretty cool Record,"I use to dig Richard Dimples Fields back in the day.He use to have me cracking up with His songs&the way he would sing or phrase parts. but He had a tight cut on here with ""if it ain't one thing it's another"". that song always made me think&reflect. He had a nice tribute to Jackie wilson on here as well. but the cut for me was""a Woman at home&a freak on the side"" that Cut always had roaring in much laughter.Bro Man always could make your sides hurt from laughing because of the way He would write&say things.to this day I don't know who was Icing Harder to try being Cooler, Richard ""Dimples"" Fields or Morris Day?? but Richard 'Dimples Fields always had that cut that you couldn't shake&you paid extra attention.some of the songs He wrote would make interesting Novels todayor storylines."
4,Interesting biography,"This is a well written, easy-to-read biography with lots, really lots of photos never seen before, among them - on a whole page - of Callas as Turandot.Two well filled CD:s from EMI are included - and in the last part of the book each aria is discussed in detail. Much value for a modest price. Why not five stars then? Well, the analysis of every aria gets a bit dull after a while. The book is, however, worth any price because so many unique photos!"
3,"Like many Callas performances, it could have been better!","This is a difficult book to comment on: having 2 CD's with Callas performances and commentary from a respected critic is marvelous, but.... One of the Big Issues in Callas' career was the way she let her voice go to pot, yet the CD tracks are not sequential, the listings do not give dates of the performances, and not all the performance notes do either. The biographical section is frequently padded, and the photographs often do not correspond with the time (or events) being described. As with most books nowadays, the publisher ran SpellCheck on the text, but no one edited it, so there are misspelled words and mis-written sentences. The CD's, though, are very much worth the price of the book, and the musical commentary is helpful. The biographical section offers no new information, but is a concise and readable summary."
3,"Good CDs, shoddy editing of the text","This book 'could have been a contender' but for shoddy editing. The poor grammar is distracting and could have been so easily avoided! The packaging is excellent and the extracts of Madame Callas's arias are among the best. However, one does not know the dates of the recording--some are obviously of the EMI family and a few live performances probably pirated versions. I have a new appreciation of the French composers (Gounod, Saint Sans, Massenet) thanks to these CDs. The first two chapters (about 2/3s of the book) are worthless as they provide no new information and appear to be copy/pasted from extant biographies. The last and third chapter is a good idea not fully developed. It provides a guide on listening to the arias which may be useful to the untrained ear. The text gives the impression is was hastily written and then well-packaged. Too bad...with a little love and care, it could have been grand!"
2,Made in China,"Well I was excited to get a quality product Made in Germany for a price that was adequate for a product Made in Germany. What I got was ""German engeneering"" made in China. I always try to avoid at all cost buying electric or other high tech products made in China because my experience with two or three of them showed me that they just lack quality and break down all the time.Performance is ok so far. I had some mismeasurements. The personal info entered can not be deleted without deleting the info for all persons saved. A few times the scale did not recognize me. It looks better on pictures than in reality.I don't recomend buying this product. It is overpriced for the actual product you get.If I had known this product was made in China I wouldn't have bought it. I am still debating if I should return it as shipping costs are high.In short, very disappointed."
1,Eats batteries for lunch,"This scale seemed to work great for about the length of the warranty period. Then it started showing LO for battery replacement. Changing batteries only made it operate for about a week, and unreliably at that. Thinking maybe the new batteries were bad, I tried again to no avail. I'd love a scale that measures body fat, but this one isn't a good choice."
3,scale,"This did not really work for me very well with the body fat. I used it for a long time as a weight scale, but I have to use my toes to lift it up to turn it on before I get the weight. It sounds small, but I struggle with my weight, and I am not really patient for this type of thing. I ended up buying a book call ""burn the fat, and build the muscle"" that is really good. It suggested that the most important thing to measure is body fat, and recommend a simple device that pinches the fat in three places. That worked really well. I got down to 9% body fat. Then I go lazy, and I am up to 17% now. However, I started at 28%.I did not find that the scale and the pinching device were very close to each other in the percentage.Hope that helps."
2,Good basket but still tips in the car...,"I love the size, design, color choice and shape of this car basket HOWEVER despite the little spikes on the bottom of the curved surface, it still tips over in the car very easily. I would suggest a false weighted bottom which I thought this design might include. I would suggest this product only if you have a secure area to place it in the car. I do enjoy the curved bottom but not enough to overcome the tipping issue."
1,Unstable!,"A lot of cars have a square or flat hump. Check you vehicle before you order this basket. Mine was flat and the basket would tip over with just normal driving. Another thing... Mine was different than pictured. The basket pictured has straight sides from top to bottom. The one I received was inset at the bottom a 1/4"". Not a big deal, but thought I would let you know. Would return it but not worth the postage."
5,Great replacement,Item was just what I was looking for and couldn't locate locally. I had a similar item that lasted for years (through four trucks) but finally was damaged and needed a new one. I really wanted the same item and was able to find it here on amazon.com. Hopeful it will last through four more trucks!
5,"Got what I wanted, But..........",I finally got the item I wanted after receiving the wrong item and taking three weeks to receive the basket.
3,Loot down,"3 1/2The Root Down remixes themselves are nothing inherently worth repeatedly listening to, although tack on some rather energetic live cuts off of multiple albums and you've got yourself a worthy EP."
3,Very good,"This EP is very good. The remixes of ""Root Down"" are very good, and call me crazy, have a gothic, weird edge to them. ""Time to Get Ill"" is better than the original, too. Not a must-have, but if you want remixes and live tracks, get it."
1,Never again,Ordered Root Down Vinyl from this seller. Got a CD single instead. Why on earth would I pay $4 for one song on a CD?!
4,for the real fans,"when I bought this cd I didnt know about the hidden track at the end. so I wasnt ready for that. It was a great surprise for me to hear the Hebrew version of ""so whatchu want"" since Im from Israel. For all the Israeli fans of the Bboys (and there a lot of them...) - you must buy this cd"
4,Beasties Live,"Length - 29:38Riding on the giant wave of success that emanated from Ill Communication, the Beastie Boys came back in 95' and put this EP together, consisting of the studio version of Root Down, and nine other tracks performed live in Europe. Overall the cd is pretty strong, offering such rocking live tracks as Heart Attack Man and Time For Livin', and excellent hip-hop tracks like Flute Loop and all versions of Root Down. The last track, Something's Got to Give, is an awesome closer- really spaced out and jamming. All in all, this album is definitely worth buying for casual or diehard Beastie Boys fans."
3,Not sure if it works,Only tired it twice and I think it works but it is difficult to determine how effective it is for me.
2,Low quality copy,"I'm not returning this item, because it isn't worth my time, and it arrived quickly and served the purpose that my friend and I were able to see the movie on the evening we wanted to. But it was a barely mediocre copy of the movie. No logo on the disc, bad color and contrast, passable sound.It says the vendor was ""Amazon LLC"" - be forewarned if you think you are buying a quality original."
5,Great movie! Great purchasing experience!,"Great movie! Great purchasing experience! Got this for a date night. Movie is a tear jerker. However, while buying this movie to receiving this movie no tears were necessary. I am a very satisfied customer."
4,Warning Label - Cry Alert - need Tissues !,"Ok this movie became a topic of conversation around our Father's Day supper table. I watched it with my 7 & 10 year children and I cryed buckets but I think it was good for us since we are dealing with my father having cancer. My one sister-in-law said she loved it but did not cry - I ask if she had a heart at all - ha ha. My other sister-in-law never saw the movie but had read reviews and thought it was low budget with good actors.This movie does have amazing actors, topic makes you think and some of you will cry.... Good movie, 1 F-bomb but in appropriate context."
3,another sentimental movie about death,"What would you do if you hadnews of your impending death?Write a list of things to do?Last wishes for dying men are fine for the rich.My personal preference is to make every minutethat I can count for the rest of the worldof men. Selfish wishes are what most people dowith their lives;I don't think it should be celebrated.Very well acted and directed, just pettyand small as a movie....sentimental."
4,Bucket List - a winner,"This is a great movie, one with much joy, sorrow, laughter and tears. Really teaches you the meaning of living your life to its fullest. No point thinking you are going to live forever - because it's just not going to happen, we are all in God's waiting room...Rich, poor, black or white there is one thing for certain we are all going to die.I highly recommed viewing this film, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
5,Bucket O' Fun,"This movie is a must-see, especially for those age 50 and above. Nicholson and Freeman play well off of each other, playing two of the most unlikely individuals to ever meet, let alone share an endearing experience together. The book of Proverbs teaches us in verse 17 of chapter 27, ""As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend."" This could not be more true of what transpires between these two men as they face their mortality together. Each learns from the other and is the better for it. I don't think I ever laughed and cried so much while watching the same movie."
3,Good film,"The Bucket List is a well made film. Jack and Morgan are fantastic, As always. A real good film!"
1,Most Depressing Movie Ever,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are perfect for their roles. I can't think of anyone who could have done better.As an older man whose cancer is in remission for now, I found this to be the most depressing movie I have ever seen. It drug on and on until finally they started their bucket list journey. Then each item on the bucket list felt like it was rushed.The Bucket List"
2,Outstanding Family Movie If You Cut Out the Cussing,"This movie is great with a good theme to use as a lesson for young adults.Unfortunately, Nicholson takes God's name in vain and that trashes the movie that I don't recommend it to teenagers. Most unfortunate, otherwise a great family movie if one can cut out the cussing that adds no value to the theme."
1,Do you need some cheering down?,"Are you too happy? Has life been too good to you? Do you need some cheering down? If the answer to any of these questions is ""yes"", then this movie is for you. The only reason I watched it is because my wife rented it. Those who say this is a comedy are the ones with ""brain damage"", as Cosby would say.If you want a comedy with essentially the same plot, I suggest ""Hook, Line, and Sinker"" with Jerry Lewis."
1,Predictable trash.,"Reiner hasn't made a good film since ""Misery"" in 1990. This film is predictable from scene one. A true waste of time. Bringing two ""big"" names together doesn't make a great film. I think Hollywood's BIG GUYS have forgotton that a film begins with the WRITING."
2,Needless foul language,Why can't good movies be made without lots of foul language? The storyline was good but there's enough trash in this world without adding to it with needless trashy talk. I guess some people really enjoy that?
5,Excellent Movie; Excellent Amazon service,Great movie that gives viewers a buffet of emotions from laughter to tears and back.The pairing of Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is tops.
1,The Bucket List - DVD,Had to return the DVD due to defects but I must say the Customer Service was Outstanding. I received a prompt credit for the return. I will continue to do business with Amazon.com
1,The Worst Film of 2007...?,"Easily, this would have topped my list of the Worst Films of 2007 had I seen it a mere 2 weeks ago. Nevertheless, this could still be the worst movie-going experience of the New Year. It's a cloying, manipulative, overacted, shameless piece of over-sentimental drivel. Nicholson portrays yet another typical Nicholson role - a grotesque, exaggerated caricature of every performance he's given the past 2 decades or so, and Morgan Freeman resurrects his usual take on the everyman, cashing yet another easy paycheck. Rob Reiner, with more hits than misses under his expanding belt, has directed a horror show more frightening in its audacity than his own ""Misery"". My grade: D"
1,NOT HAPPY,"BEEN WANTING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME, STILL CAN'T BECAUSE IT WON'T PLAY ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY INTO IT. WILL RETURN FOR EITHER A BETTER COPY OR GET MONY BACK."
4,A must see - for young and old alike!,Just saw this beautiful little movie for the second time on cable and enjoyed it as much if not more than the first time. I saw it with my mom who could not stop asking why a movie like this did not fetch an Oscar or 5!While it of course is slightly predictable I do not feel it takes anything away from the movie. It managed to bring a very difficult phase in the two main characters and their families lives to the silverscreen in a very positive manner - and shed a positive spin on the inevitability of growing old and eventually dying. Much like Tuesdays with Morris did both in the book and movie.A must see - for older people to lift their spirits and incite them to be active and enjoy themselves to the end - and for younger people to remind them to enjoy life and spread happiness to others while they still can.
3,Live Life,"While thoroughly enjoyable this film was completely predictable. The plot proceeded as expected, and Nicholson has seemingly played a variant of fly-be-free unseemly older man goes off-the-rails in at least two other films. He does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill. Freeman's character experiences and expresses a wider range of feeling and transition, and it is he the audience comes to identify with most. The message of the film is uplifting, though decidedly more humorous. At times it seemed to not know if it was a drama or a comedy. Approach it with humor and it won't disappoint."
5,If you only like Morgan Freeman's Voice!,"Two of my favourite actors combine in this movie to create very simply a light-hearted entertaining movie of two very different people who combine both in character and real life to bring undiscovered sides out of each other.Sure they didn't change the world, but then again, I was only after a movie and not a historic world event. If you only love Morgan Freeman's voice from the Shawshank then you might just like this too. Great actors. Good plot. A little sad. Loved it...."
5,What a duo! Well done and very moving!,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were made for these roles. Such a contrast in individuals and excellent character development as the movie progress. Freeman play a hard-working mechanic with a focus on seeing his children do well but in doing so has given up some of his dreams. Nicholson plays the wealthy, inconsiderate, snobby, businessman who has alienated family and friends. The two meet when they have both been diagnosed with terminal illness and are sharing a semi-private room in a hospital Nicholson owns. As the story plays out the two develop a friendship and end up on an end-of-life quest to accomplish a list each has made of things they want to do before dying. This movie takes you from crying to laughing and back again. Highly recommend!!"
3,Not bad,"This movie made me wish I could die with a rich person. How great it would be to really live life before passing away. It might make your passing easier. This is a good movie about two guys, who never met before they shared a hospital room together. They are both dying from cancer. After they were told how long they have to live they made a bucket list. For those who don't know what that is. It is a list of things to do before passing.... Kicking the bucket. They set off together to do all of the things on the bucket list. In the end they were both happy to have known each other."
5,The Bucket List,This movie makes you think about your life and how short and special it is. Great job by all
4,Classic Jack!!,"We watched this movie, not really knowing what to expect, we enjoyed it totally. Many laughs, a few tears, a very good story that makes you think about life. We should all make a ""bucket list"" NOW, don't wait too late as you will probably not run across the perfect friend like these two did to achieve life long goals in a short period of time. I love both these guys, but Jack's ornery face makes me laugh everytime he grins! You can't help but love him when you know he's thinking something rotten! :)"
4,"Touching, Uplifting and Well Acted","I have seen many low reviews for the Bucket List, however it doesn't deserve them. It has it's sad and even depressing moments but it's still uplifting and touching. How many movies do we get about living life to the fullest ? The answer is simply, not enough. Sure we all aren't rich like Nicholson's character so we all can't see the world before we die. But the movies heart is in the right place and it's well acted with gorgeous locations.I think the problem is that critics have just gotten too used to handing Rob Reiner movies one star and this one didn't deserve it at all. Nicholson and Freeman both have charm and the movie has some too. Maybe there's something wrong with me, I didn't see the Davinci Code as being that bad either lol. But I liked this movie and am ready to stick up for it if I have to."
3,"rent, dont buy","I was disappointed that this movie despite having great potential was not deep enough in both meaning and story line. The movie was slow to start with and then became so rushed with not enough 'adventure' and dialogue between the two of them (morgan and jack) for you to really feel and understand how these men have affected one another and what they mean to each other, so on that point it is a disappointment. However it is a movie to pass time by and it has some of its funny moments, overall ok but i wouldn't want to watch it again. Rent, don't buy."
4,"Good warm story, a little slow at times but many fine moments","There are pithy messages here, for cancer patients, survivors, and anyone willing to look at mortality and what it brings up in the heart about how we could choose to live our lives, before and after a diagnosis. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are well cast, in somewhat stereotypical but great counterpoint leads. Sorrow and joy, wealth and limitations (of the mind as well as earnings) faith and redemption. Well worth seeing, and starting to think about our own Bucket Lists :)"
5,WONDERFUL MOVIE!!,"ANOTHER WONDERFUL JOB WITH TWO GREAT ACTOR'S. THE JOURNEY THROUGHOUT THEIR TRAVELS WAS CAPTIVATING, THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FILM SHOULD ALSO BE AWARDED! A MUST SEE, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!! R.T. BEND,OREGON"
3,Two legends save movie,"This movie is good b/c Nicholson and Freeman are great. The first third of the movie takes place in a hospital room. It's there dialogue that carries the film and keeps you interested. I guess this film is a good way to look at life. (""you only live once"" kind of thing.) In the end I thought it was a good movie. If you're able to get past the fact that the two leads heads are super-imposed on the bodies of others while skydiving, riding a motorcycle on the great wall of china, etc. then you'll be just fine. All in all a ""nice"" movie."
2,Empty Bucket,"I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Their acting here is, as usual, superb. However, this is not a comedy -- unless you find terminal cancer a knee-slapper. I don't want to pay money to see someone who is undergoing chemotherapy racing to the toilet to vomit. But I dunno, maybe it's just me. I had to watch a few 'Three Stooges' episodes to get undepressed. For funny, I'll take a good poke in the eyes any ol' day."
5,The Bucket List,"Wonderful movie! If you have not seen it, make time and see it! This one will make you cry..."
3,not as good as I expected,"I had been waiting to see this movie for a while and my expectations given the two giants in it were very high. The message is good and it is a good story but somehow I was very dissapointed.It is not that they both die at the end because I was expecting that, even sooner in the movie. It is just that it was not as good of a movie as I had expected to see. A little dissapointed even if the actors did very well. I am not sure what is missing in this movie, but there is something that did not satisfy me at all."
4,The Bucket List...,"Not for the whole family and there is quite a bit of language. I thought it was a pretty good movie with the exception of the language. It is sweet and poingnant at times, funny and hilarious at others. It makes you think about what is important and maybe reassess what you haven't done yet with your life."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"As someone who had prejudged this movie, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Having watched the TV clip,I thought it would be a movie that was contrived to make these two actors look good. With what I thought would be expected laughs with little substance. Boy was I wrong!To my surprise, it was the good Zen, lack of Zen cop, done with great humor,fun, sentiment and as in life, a surprise at its end:)"
2,A waste of their time and yours.,"This movie has but the thinnest hint of the greatness that it could have achieved. Two absolutely first-rate actors, Nicholson and Freeman, wallow about for an uncommonly long time in a sappy and unlikely story line, apparently unable to find a way out.Never have two such magnificent actors, both gifted with immense natural talent, taken so long to accomplish so little. The only way they could have achieved less would be to talk longer."
5,Classic movie!,This is a great movie that is a great experience to watch! I highly recommend it to anyone of any age!
4,Great movie,I thought the movie was great. The quality of the video on my Kindle was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
3,the bucket list,my best friend told me it was the best film he had ever seen .it was good but not up to Midnight Cowboy am I sad @ but at 77yrs it was to me the best
4,Viewed,Great movie -- it was a rental I veiwed this did not purchase. No fault of the website or seller. I hope I don't have to answer for everything I have looked at and not purchased.... little tiring.
5,wife loved it!,I Don't have 21 words to say about this! I like it and it all worked as it should. great!
2,"GREAT ACTORS, LOUSY MATERIAL","Just about everybody I know who watched this movie really loved it. I know I'm going to get clobbered for this review but......It's not like I have anything against THE BUCKET LIST premise but really, what is so exciting about these characters jumping out of a plane, racing cars and being digitally imposed into the world's most famous landmarks ? Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.On my personal bucket list, missing this DVD will be item #1."
2,the Bucket List,Great video of an exceptional movie. The whole family loved it. This was a replacement for an older version movie.
4,I liked it...,"Love both of these actors and liked seeing them doing such a touching film, yes it was sad but the story was great. Rob Reiner can do really great things as a director, love all his films."
5,Dynamic Duo,"Most of the reviews I read of this film at the time of it's theatrical release cited disappoinment in the much anticipated teaming of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Having now seen the film I ask the film's critics what they have been smoking. Nicholson and Freeman riff off each other like they've been working together for years. What were they expecting, ""Hamlet""?! Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them. Considering that the film deals with cancer patients it could have been maudlin and saccharine. ""The Bucket List"" earns every ounce of emotion and tears it engenders from the audience. Defy the critics and check out this gem of a movie."
2,"Good actors in a too ""feel good"" move","Disappointing, I'd say. Very good actors in a somewhat predicatble all too ""feel good"" film. We rented it - I wouldn't buy it. I'd give it 2 and a half stars if I could."
3,My parents liked it.,"I thought the movie was pretty average and very predictable, But I love Jack and Morgan. Easy to watch but nothing special."
5,Jack Nicholson at his best and a great story,"Having worked in the medical field for 40 years I felt right at home with these characters and ""characters"" they really are. Jack Nicholson will apparently let them make him up to look as bad as they want for the sake of the movie. Or, maybe he actually looks that bad. This is a very believable heart rending story of the bonding of two men that could not have less in common except one thing - cancer. Take a great story and film it in wonderful places all over the world then put in a wonderful ending and you've got great movie entertainment."
2,Disappointing...,"I was very surprised by the number of glowing reviews that this movie received from viewers. First, the movie marketed itself as a comedy, yet clearly was not. The movie was dramatic and philosophical but not particularly deep. And this is my second point - the movie tried too hard to be philosophical and deep, yet didn't cover any new ground in the arena of death and life. There wasn't anything new here that I haven't already seen in other films. The movie was not even entertaining, it was laborious and self important."
4,Just a Great Movie,"Two men, an auto mechanic by the name of Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) and Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), a Fortune 500 company owner, are both diagnosed with cancer and told they have six months to live. The two men, mere opposites are now hospital roommates. Carter decideds to take some advice a teacher once gave him and compile a bucket list before he ""kicks the bucket"". Ed Cole has a better idea, they create one together. The two vow to achieve as many goals as possible before the inevitable happens.A story of friendship and of courage, Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" is the most emotional movie I have ever seen. Sad, heartwarming, touching and at times humorous, ""The Bucket List"" is a must see movie and is great to watch with the family. Don't forget to keep a box of Kleenex handy, you may need it for this film."
2,Not spectacular,"Not as good as expected with these 2 great actors. The acting was good, but the cinematography was horrible. Each location was clearly obvious they weren't there. I expected more from this movie."
3,"Good message, but...SPOILER","This movie has a good message: live while you're alive instead of waiting 'til you're about to die. However, except for a few scenes, I got bored. And how could the guy who died first narrate what happened to the other guy?"
4,bucket list,Bucket list i lked it a lot. if more of us could do what they did. it would make the end of life more acceptable. The rest of us will have to do the best we can with thettime we have left and trust god will do the best for us as we sit on our cloud watching the world go by.
