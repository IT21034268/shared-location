5,Destination Blues,"Have been listening to this CD all weekend and just love it. They know what to do with the blues. Also have just had the pleasure of hearing them live at HiCees in Ventura, CA. We just couldn't quit dancing. How lucky can we get?"
3,"Greeted, but not needed","Small short length capturing the hugely influential slow-core band around a modest sound familiar to great early work Long Division. As beautifully disciplined as the band is, and as much as I am a personal fan, there isn't a whole lot to recommend to casual listeners. The only real highlight for me comes not even with the praised Joy Division cover, but the following more sublime track. The rest are predictably moody, but hardly hits any deep ranges we expect from the committed trio."
3,"The cover of Joy Division's ""Transmission"" shines.","To put it in non-muscial terms, I've always found Low's music to be about patience and reward, and the rewards are great with Low's wonderful cover of Joy Division's ""Transmission."" From the simple, haunting beginning to the soaring finale, Low evokes the sound of Joy Division while making the song their own. The rest of the EP, however, is a test of patience: seemingly an attempt to reduce their musical minimalism to a tedious academic exercise. Caroline 2, for example, gives us the long build-up of Long Division's Caroline (but drawn out to absurd lengths), while denying us the original's cathartic release. The other songs are similarly a drag. But hey! This is an EP - get it for that great cover; you can ignore the rest."
4,A must have book for soapmakers,"I loved this book. I read the whole thing in one day. The recipes are great and easy to follow and turn out awesome. The only problem I had was in the section about fragrances and oils, she didn't say what to use to dilute the essential oils down to 1%. Other than that, the books is great!"
4,300 Handcrafted Soaps,Easy instructions with easily obtained ingredients. We had lots of fun creating lovely and unique soaps and soap gifts.
5,Definately Awesome,"With this CD, Buckethead just passed go, collected $200 and blew me away. The whole thing never slows down, it's a constant stream of metal insanity designed to warp your brain, and it rocks. A definate buckethead essential, order it today :D"
4,Great CD And Very Different,I just recently started listening to Buckethead and this is the first CD I bought. It's all instrumental funk metal and strange but good. It's hard to describe but worth buying.
4,Guilty pleasure,"Okay, this isn't anything great by any means, but is it fun to listen to? Hell ya. Is this some of his better stuff? No. Is it still fun to listen to? Yes. Does the drum machine get tiresome after a while? Yes which is my main complaint about this album. IF it didn't use a drum machine it would be 50 times better.As I said before, this is just a fun album to listen to, nothing more than that."
2,Not good at all,"Not his best work. It is very erratic with seemingly no clear direction. This is not anything like his better stuff, Nottingham Lace, Soothsayer, Pepper's Ghost, Jordan, Bucketheadland, etc. I couldn't listen to this more than 4-5 times before giving up on it."
3,The Ten Commandments:The Musical DVD,"The reason I purchased this dvd, is because Adam Lambert was in it. I was curious to see how he performed before American Idol. He has one main solo and was fantastic in it! I was surprised to that Val Kilmer was in a musical. He does not normally do these, but did a great job! To buy this, you must like musicals and the topic as well. This would have been a great stage production...I will probably not watch this again. For the price I paid, I enjoyed it!"
2,OK,I actually got this for my daughter cause she liked the music but the acting was very poorly done.....don't know what else to say!
4,My Review,"I'm glad I bought this DVD. The reason I bought it is because I like Val Kilmer as an actor, and also because Adam Lambert was in it. Also, I found out another actor who I saw on One Life To Live was in it too. His name is Nick Rodriquez."
3,The Ten Commandments,"Brought this Dvd, cover wasn't what was shown I was a bit dissapointed I wanted the one that had Adam Lambert on front. Val kilmer can't sing which makes the musical painful but there are alot of talented singers in the show."
3,"Loved ""Is Anybody Listening""","I bought this DVD because Adam Lambert was in the show, and because I have enjoyed watching Val Kilmer in other productions. Adam's song, ""Is Anybody Listening"" was great. The best way to get it, though, is just to download the single.For the rest? Yawn."
1,NOT a musical in the traditional sense,"Sad Sad Sad.....While I am usually a big fan of most any theatre, this ""musical"" hits rock bottom for me.A shame as it has some of the better talanted cast among it's ranks, but you can hear it in thier voices, ""Please save me from the bad scripting!"" every time they sing.First off, there is NO dialoge whatsoever. This negates explaining anything which I suppose I could overlook if it was not for the ""Let's sing to explain something"" approach.Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but in my experience, dialoge explains and moves the story. The music and dance numbers comes when there is so much emotion, it cannot be put into words. I was falling asleep during most of the movie because there really was no high emotional peak in the film, it was just a drab story that people happened to be singing to."
2,This is like...,"This is like Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream coat... post lobotomy.Seriously, the lyrics are so bad. They rhymed ""Jericho"" with ""wherever you go,""It's a very pretty show with some decent voices and some worthwhile chorus boys. And props to the actors for keeping straight faces through this turkey.Do the MST3K boys ever attend the theatre? Cause here's a gem for their purposes."
3,The 10 Commandments,It is not the best musical that I have ever seen. Some of the music is beautiful especially the amazing singing of Adam Lambert. The choreography definitely needs some hard work. The story and the vocals make it worth the watch.
3,Good Music and okay performance from Val Kilmer,"I saw the live production in Hollywood. Great performances from supporting cast and I like the music as well. I'm a fan of Val Kilmer, but he is not that great singer and can't really share the same stage with others who are so good."
4,Breaking the Commandments,"I was longing for a chance to see The Ten Commandments when the musical played in LA, but was not in the area. When the DVD version came out I jumped at a chance to purchase it, esp at this low price.It is a spectacle musical, lots of contemporarily influenced choreography, scenic is well done, although they have applied effects that I am sure were not in the production, to enhance the DVD. Performances were done well too, and this was way before the Adam Lambert / American Idol craze.Additionally at the end of the DVD the extras provide insight to the overall development of the production.Certainly glad that I bought this DVD."
1,THE FINAL PLAGUE OF EGYPT,"Often imitation is a form of flattery. In the case of this musical, it is not. The ideal of a musical based on a Biblical hero with a modern score and little dialogue has been done before with great success. To attempt to repeat that formula by lesser artists was folly. The worst aspect of this musical is found it it's music and lyrics. The music is totally out of place and the lyrics are terrible at best. The choreography looks foolish. sometimes laughable and I am surprised by Bob Iscoves unimaginative direction. Living in Los Angeles, I too read the bad reviews and elected not to attend. But was this musical as bad as the reviews claimed? Oh yes and probably even worse on closer inspection. It brings to the stage not even one interesting moment. Painful to watch."
5,The 10 Commandments: the musical with Val Kilmer,"First of all, we didn't know Val could sing. He reminded us of Joe Cocker in parts. It was a good musical and we enjoyed it. It didn't follow the Bible very well but that's not unusual.It was done on stage but had great visuals with it. Wonderful singers. We wanted to see Adam Lambert ( American Idol runner-up for season 8). He belongs in musicals...great actor,very good at expressing feelings when singing. He should stay in musical theater.If you like musicals you will enjoy this one."
5,What a Find!,"My thanks to Eric T. Johnson for introducing me to the music of Herbie Nichols. I have an extensive Blue Note collection, but somehow Nichols ""flew under the radar"" and I had not heard his stuff. What a great and unappreciated talent!Johnson ( a fine guitarist) arranges Nichol's compositions for a band and succeeds on every level. Buy this disc, Nichol's own recordings and also any music from The Herbie Nichols Project and you will not be disappointed."
1,You probably won't get the CD shown if you order this!,"Though the cover and track listing shows Sammy Hagar's first self-titled release unofficially known as Sammy Hagar's Red album from around 1978, I twice received (and returned) Sammy's 1987 CD, which was eventually titled ""I Never Said Goodbye"" some time after it was released as a self-titled CD while he was still in VH. If you can, verify what you're getting before ordering! You can find this actual CD by searching for Sammy Hagar - Red.My 1 star review doesn't reflect my opinion of either release - just of the erroneous listing."
4,Good Basic shower head replacement...,"I purchased this as a replacement for a broken handheld shower for an 85 year old man.I installed it for him - installation was a breeze and he loved the spray patterns.The only complaint we both had was that the hose is extremely stiff, hard to straighten out (It might with continued use) and when my grandfather tries to put it down the head often turns unpredictably to one side or another because of the stiffness of the hose.I hope with time it 'relaxes' a little more, but a metal shower hose that is more flexible would be preferred. His only other comment was he wished the handle was more slip resistant - as once his hand gets soapy it is hard to fight against the stiff hose and it is often dropped due to it being slippery."
1,it didn't work for me,"I followed a user guide to install its driver on my old laptop which had B Wireless built in, but this G wireless adapter couldn't detect any signal even I sat next to the wireless router. Tried to reinstall several times and also downloaded a driver from its web site. It still couldn't detect any signal though the built in B wireless of the laptop could detect."
4,Good debut. Some intense moments!,"After a somewhat melancholy beginning, Vernon Buford is a welcome addition to my book shelf. Shadows of Legion is the first of a trilogy.Join Scott Macklin, Father Los Cruzado, Douglas Prichard and Rachel Walters as they begin the quest to take on the forces of darkness. But unlike Frank Perett or Parker Hudson, Vernon Buford tackles a subject in spiritual warfare that I've never seen, Legion. They are many, yet they are one. This reveals some heart pounding suspense that will hit many between the eyes. Crisp words combine with fresh hope, and a Savior who we can trust and have faith in when things sometimes go so wrong! But then again, Jesus is there in the good times and the bad, amen?Vernon Buford. Who can forget a name like that? It is a name, that I hope won't go away quietly. I can't wait to read more by this man!"
3,Where was the victory?,"I enjoyed the book up to a point. It was filled with twists and turns and surprises. What bothered me was, that even though Rachel and the Father confessed to be Christians, they were not proactive in what they should have known in Scripture. When the Father said the 23rd Psalm and legion reacted negatively and then when the 4 of them joined together to pray, both things any believer would know how to do. For anyone who truly believes they would know about the Armor of God, the authority of Name of Jesus, etc. I know that the story was fiction but to leave out some very key elements was disappointing. I was very disheartened in the ending. It was as if they drove away defeated and in great fear. It said he wold be writing book #2. I will read that and see if that is better."
1,just think about it,"this ain't no ""santa claus"", this ain't no kris kringle, this is ""the family values tour"", and it's a lot siller every time you listen to it, heh heh heh!"
5,stained ie awsome,"the only reason this cd is so good is because it is the only cd where you go find the song outside that has both fred durst and aaron lewis. that song clearly proves how much talent they both have. they are not just singers, they are what we like to call artist"
3,Not as much as it should have been,"I loved Family Values '98, but this time they had put on less rock and replaced it with some emotional bullsh**. The few rock songs are really good but I expected more from this album."
4,Pretty good cd but not the best,"This cd is pretty good, it doesn't have the best line-up, I wouldn't reccommend it. I always have to skip the rap song with Method Man and Redman and ""keep hope alive"" by crystal method who belongs on tour with the backstreet boys or something. This cd would have been a lot better if there were appearances by deftones or incubus or something. I especially like the appearances by filter and korn and limp bikit. I think the bonus track ""outside"" with Aaron Lewis and Fred Durst is amazing.BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION!!"
3,somethings missing,"Well first off, I wish Staind had some more tracks ""Mudshovel"" is pretty good but they have alot of other great songs besides that one. Korn and Limp Bizkit were the best tracks.Outside would definetly have to be my favorite track.I don't really see why Method man and Red Man had to be on the cd they aren't even rock.It's just a pain to get up and skip the track.The bottom line is that if you are a fan of the tour buy it. if you wan't a great live cd buy Tatoo The Earth- the firstcrusade. Its just a great cd of lesser known metal bands, without any anoying rap."
3,"Good bands, decent collection.","I would think this would appeal mostly to those who saw this tour, but it's still a good disc. I don't like it as much as the 1998 tour, but it's still good. ""Limp Bizkit"" dominates this collection, but there's still good songs from ""Primus"", ""Staind"", and ""The Crystal Method"". The live ""Outside"" is the bonus song here, and ""Durst"" also covers ""I Would For You"", which is an old ""Jane's Addiction"" song, though it's not near as great as the original. Overall this is good if you like the bands, otherwise it doesn't have much ""Value""."
5,asolutely the best,I purchases this product at an place that i go to to have my chemical peels done and it is the best product that i have used as far as skin care goes. I noticed that the hyperpigmentation on my skin has started to fade in 1-2 weeks. I love it!
2,dried out my skin,"I love PCA Skin. But I have mild breakouts, more black heads and white heads and sometimes a random big zit. I thought this would clear up my mild break outs. Honestly I don't use it that often and my face is pretty dry. I have oily skin but this is drying me out. I have backed off and stopped using it. With drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often. So unless you have pretty bad break outs I don't recommend this. I also use the pigmentation bar. I love this. And I'm sticking to this one for sure. That one helps keep my break outs at bay I think."
4,It works pretty well.,"I've tried all sorts of drug store products and prescription products in attempt to rid my acne, but none of them really produced the results that I've been hoping for. (Never tried Accutane, though.) I think the blemish control bar works pretty well for me in controlling and reducing my acne breakouts. It's also helped fade away some of my acne scars over the course of a few weeks."
4,"In A Dark, Dark, Wood",A delightful book. Just right for the younger child (if they aren't afraid of ghosts. Pop-up on the last page.) The illustrations fit the story as well as the copy. A good book for any time of the year ... especially Halloween!
3,The Lady is Back,"With a cool sexy new sound and very hip music, the first track off of this single ""Please Stay"" is a really nice dance music to share with friends. Age has just gotten better for this ex-Mickey Mouse Club gal."
4,Real results with real work,"I have spent the last 6 weeks working through the book, with the CDs, one unit a week. Sometimes I only listen, some times I only read, sometimes I listen and read. But I go back and make sure I can say the phrases and I keep repeating the them. I also work with a friend once a week, just speaking in Spanish for a couple of hours. We do not focus on the book or CD's when she comes, but just talk. The units really drill things into my head and then I put them into practice when I speak with my friend. I strongly recommend this method for people serious about learning Spanish.I've had maybe 4 weeks worth of Spanish lessons about 8 years ago and I've picked up a few phrases before I traveled, but my Spanish prior to using the book was minimal at best. I also have studied French for almost 10 years and am nearly fluent. This has added to my confidence and made me more willing to work to see the results."
2,Mediocre,"My Spanish is pretty good but I got the course to try to increase my fluency. I used just the cassettes while biking.On the positive side, the quality of the sound is excellent.On the negative side, the course is committed to endless seemingly mindless boring substitution drills that seems to have the effect of short-term rote learning. This strikes me like mostly a waste of time. Has any scholar verified that the method really works?The much better approach is Pimsleur's, which consists mostly of back and forth translations (model dialogue, then translation from Spanish to English, then Spanish to English translation of the same dialogue). That seems much, much more useful.So I say: go with the Pimsleur method."
2,Best used with other materials,"This course is very hard to stick with. I agree with the other reviewers, everything is just thrown at you. The way the beginning is set up doesn't seem to make much sense. You have to drill pages of words before you're shown how to pronounce the alphabet properly. Not everything seemed to be covered, with the greetings, grammar, etc. An alright course, if you have the dedication, but definately for use with something else."
5,Incredible Historical Romance novel,"This is book number 6 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett. This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman and her descendants. This particular book is split in half following two stories -- that of Cole and Heather, and Lizette and Bain (grandchildren of Loedicia from book 1).I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books. I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through. It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series.This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more."
4,Jack Woodford rocks!,Ignore the ignorant one star review - Jack Woodford's advice is as timely today as it was when he wrote it - you just have to have the imagination to update it and apply it to current markets. If it was good enough for Ray Bradbury it should be good enough for you!
4,A good study guide,"This Haggadah is written in a manner which makes it fun to read and the plain English translations and additional commentary provide a reasonably good outline to understanding the traditional Haggadah. Much of the traditional Hebrew is incleded but significant portions, such as the melodic Hallel prayers are not. I liked the technique used by the author of using the proverbial 4 children (wise, rebellious, simple and to young to ask) to ask questions throughout the commentaries. I think that this book is better used as a study guide. If there are useful commentaries, add them as a discussion while using a traditional Haggadah."
1,Bigotted garbage,This hagaddah is American chauvenism disguised as Judaism. It includes for example a timeline of antisemitism which lists publication of Mein Kampf by an extremist Japanese magazine alongside the Holocaust and the destruction of the Second Temple.
5,Great earrings for baby!,The 4mm balls are a perfect size. My daughter has been wearing these since she was 6 months old. The screw backs are essential. Purchased these for a friend because I loved them so much.
5,Ultimate Horror,"Based on an old folklore tale, this well written novel illustrating the age old battle of good and evil will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The well developed story begins with the pagan ritual that calls the evil entity into being and takes the reader through its reign of terror and torment upon generation after generation of a family. If you are not a believer of pure evil roaming the earth, this book will definitely make you question your beliefs."
2,Clone of Haynes standard -,"Knew problem was related to fuel system, and probably related to the mixture. Knew there were several components that influenced the mixture and might need to be replaced. None of these components are even referenced in this guide at all! O2 sensor, EGR valve, EHA Valve. Very disappointed. Seems like they just took a standard Haynes repair manual sections (diesel, injectors, etc), and had someone substitute in diagrams from Mercedes."
2,Haynes... Ugh,"I bought this manual because I didn't know a crap-ton about the Mercedes I owned. This manual is fraught with helpful information and stupidity. It is itself an oddity.I will give one example: The manual will give you step by step directions on how to assemble the automatic transmission. The manual then refuses to tell it's owner how to adjust headlights, even chides the owner implying that they are too simple to properly complete said operation.I've heard that Chilton's and Haynes are now one, I really hope not. In the past I've had nothing but luck with Chiltons and would encourage one to buy a Chilton's manual if possible."
2,Rehash,This book is a rehash of other manuals. I dont use it that much for alot of it is outdated. There are better ways to spend your money.
4,Sonny,I enjoyed this cd. I remember the song Hey Conducgtor from when I was a teen. There are several other songs on the cd I rewally enjoyed.
3,A good solid offering from Takahashi,"I bought the first volume of this in a musty old book store, picking it up because I'm a big Takahashi fan. She seems to me to be the queen of creating what I like to call ""loveable yet clueless jerks."" Her male leads are usally vartiations on this. They mean well, but don't seem to pay very much attention. Kosaku is not exception. He's a goof, a guy who lets his stomach rule his mind, yet belives that everything will turn out ok in the end. This isn't ground breaking stuff- just more of Takahashi doing what she does best. Interesting characters, and a solid tradmark style- this is worth a look."
4,Very pleasant listening,"I was never much a fan of this singer, but the joy he brings across in his delivery of these old favorites has won me over. Granted some of the songs herein are better sung by a tenor--although Hampson's voice is very close to that range--and the many singers mentioned in the notes who were noted for these songs makes one all the more aware of earlier recordings far better than some of these offerings. But the point is they are all together on one CD with excellent sound, adequate orchestral accompaniment, and (by the way) good notes about the composers and the complete texts with English (and French) translations. So this is really one good buy--not exactly a Grabbit--but much recommended for those who love the old time melodies."
5,"A ""Must"" Have!",Just received this glorious CD and believe it's probably the most outstandingly beautiful one I own of Mr Hampson's (and I own many). Each track is an uplifting joy! This is Hampson at his melodious best.
4,Very enjoyable,"Beautiful diction. Highly enjoyable. Although I am used to Fritz Wunderlich et al singing these songs, it's also very nice hearing a baritone. ""Sei nich Bös"" is my particular favorite on this album. This is one of my ""go to"" albums when I want to cheer up."
3,A bit grim and forced,"Over the past twenty years Hampson has set out to prove that he can sing anything a baritone voice could wrap itself around, from Bach to Broadway. He does amazingly well, but this CD is a miss. Hampson is a lot of things, but light and smiling isn't two of them. He blusters and sometimes shouts, a far cry from the melting insouciance of echt Viennese style."
2,"Musicianship, but no sparkle","Mr. Hampson spends as much care and and craft on these songs as he would on lieder, but the results were disappointing to me. The zest and sparkle that I expect from Viennese operetta is just not there. So, my vote is for less restraint and musicianship and more ""joyful abandon"" in performance."
1,"Beware, the workbook is of no use without the audio component.","Amazon sells only the workbook, and not the absolutely necessary set of CD's made to go with the workbook. 75% of the activities in the workbook require listening to the CD's. The CD sold to go with the textbook in not the same."
4,A little slow BUT....,"....there is a very nice, etheral quality to this album. I really liked the sparse, basic sound of the quitars and drums. The only flaw, and something that prevented this already good album from being rated higher is that all the songs are slow. You have to be in the right mood to listen to this all the way through, but if you are in the right mood you will discover a real gem."
3,Becoming beautiful,"3 1/2Marred by a relatively lackluster second side, the slow-mo glow of Low's flow on this sophomore entry initially streaks a bruising brightness, assuredly compounding stilled pacing, restrained playing, and of course, haunted harmonics."
3,Sharpe's Set 2 DVDs,Poor sound quality and fuzzy outdoor picture quality. But I love the series and put up with the drawbacks. It would be wonderful if the producers could re-master all of them to improve the sound and picture.
1,Radioplay,This is not a soundtrack. it is a radioplay/book on tape of episode 1 of Avatar the Last Airbender. It has 4 tracks of sound and the story spoken in german.
1,"Cardboard characters, entertaining plot","Parts of this book are descriptive, entertaining and informative in a Scotland Yard procedural sense but the heroine -an Oxfordian educated super woman - is a corrogated cut out whothe author inexplicably fails to describe. Tall? Beautiful? Leggy? Buxomy? Forget it; the reader will not find out. Just accept this female James Bond as a super woman and let it go at that."
1,"Compared to Rowley's other works, this was dissapointing.","On a whole, I like the Bazil Broketail series. This book, however, set on the same world, was not on par with Rowley's other books. The characters are not as well formed, especially the princess, Serena, and the action is slow. Both prince and princess come off as whiners, although they are set up to be the heros. Go with the Broketail series and forget this one."
3,A pain ... but still good to have.,This thing is nice to have for games you get so tired of being unable to beat. But it's a real pain to have to go through the process of setting it up before hand.
2,It is awsome when it works,"When it works, it is awesome! However, I tried using games like zelda and banjo kazooie and it would look different, it was all black, except for banjo. It commonly freezes your games, and most of the keycode games don't work. Some games work, but a lot of the codes have no effect on the games. I bought a second one and the same games still didn't work."
1,Gameshark,"I never got it to work but the item was fairly inexpensive, so I didn't bother returning it."
1,why i am a displeased coustmer,when i recieved the gameshark pro. i tried putting it in my n64. i tried several different methods to see if i could get it to work. all ive tried failed. so with a friends help i tried to get it sent back for a replacement. id like a replacement please. until then ive been ripped off.
2,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this product. It erased all my games like goldeneye and zelda. It also broke about a year after I bought it. It also freezes my games sometimes. If your interested in buying it don't be surprised if it brakes or screws up your games, ... , they should make it better quality."
2,Where can I find the newest vesion of GameShark Pro?,"I recently purchased a GameShark Pro at the local Wal-Mart. When I tried to find out whethher it was a 3.0 or higher it didn't say on the box or anywhere for that matter. After I bought it and took it home. I discovered it was a 2.1, this is a very old vesion of the GameShark Pro. Why are they even selling these old versions? I couldn't play any games that I had on that GameShark Pro. I ended up taking it back the next day. Why doesn't Interact put the number of it's capabilities on the outside of the box? All I know is that I am looking for one that is 3.0 or higher. Soo Buyers Beware!"
1,Does not work!,"I read all of the instructions I could find, and I could not even get the product to count down from five, which means I couldn't get it to turn on!"
4,Not durable,FIRST TIME I GOT IT IT DID NOT WORK SECOND TIME IT WORKED 2 WEEKS AND THE LAST TIME I GOT IT THE LIGHT WON'T WORK AND STOPPED WORKING IN ONE AND A HALF WEEK
2,"Gameshark ""The real deal""","Is gameshark worth its price? I dont think so..... I have had 4 game sharks each lasting about a month. Do you think i cant take care of it think again. My first I guess I was a little clumsy with it,but because of this I was determined to get my next one and take care of it. I use my money on three occasions to purchase this product. Its fun at first but not when you have to replace it 4 times. my 4th was a gameshark Pro ooooohhhhh... It lasted three months."
3,Gameshark Pro Review,"The Gameshark is an excellent product,with an exception that it can mess up your game. I used it on Banjo-Kazooie,and it won't let me climb trees. Buy only if you're really stuck."
2,Don't buy unless your willing to waste ($),"When I got my Gameshark it was pretty fun, but after about a year, it stopped working. I didn't mishandle it or anyhting, it just stopped working. I don't think it should just stop working. I think for [the money] it should work better than it has for me. I mean, why waste your money just to have to buy a new one a year later. If you do buy a Gameshark I'll warn you that unless you have alot of spare money floating around, you shouldn't buy this product."
3,GameShark,"The GameShark is cool. I found a lot of cool codes for all of my N64 games. The only problem with this is my N64 periodically froze or didn't even start up. I always had to reset it. It was annoying, but when it worked it was fun."
1,Gameshark Pro,I bought the game shark a few days ago and I was trying to find a code for a game and I had to go and do some thing and when I got back it would not work any more so if you are going to buy this product let me say DON'T for it's not worth the money or the hasel to get it for it's hard to find the right code you want for the game and also if you have a game like Fx zero you have to open a key code with one game then you have to shut the game off then you have to put Fx zero in and then go and find the game to do the codes it is to much of a hasel.
1,Gameshark ...,Do not buy this i just bought a n64 and a gameshark and a few games also. When i got home I tried to use it but it wouldnt work because you have to have a game that does not require a key code and it didnt say anywhere before i got home with it about this. Then when i went to play a game after turning on the gameshark without a game my nintendo would not work anymore. So if you are thinking about buying this product you may want to think about whether or not its really worth it.
3,GameShark: Be Warned,"I got my gameshark about 1 year ago. I admit that it was fun, and it still is, but just about after 2 months, they came out with a new model and my favorite and NEW games would not work on it. I don't know how to get it upgraded, so i just want to put out a caution to all of you who want to buy this. If you buy this, i guarantee that you will be angry at yourslef because you wil have to spend a lot of money to keep on getting new versions of this."
2,Lack of customer service,"I bought the GameShark Pro for N64. Codes and functionality are fine. However, the unit fritzed out. I have written to the GameShark company twice and have received absolutely no response. Be forewarned that customer service appears to be non-existent with this product."
1,didn't work,"I cleaned it and everything else. Sometimes a number will appear and then disappear, I was unable to get it to work. Bad Deal."
1,Don't buy it!,"Nintendo 64 - Game Shark ProMy ten-year-old son thought it was great for the first twenty-four hours that it actually worked. On day two it didn't matter what game he used it on, it simply wouldn't work. He was very disappointed."
3,You all are idiots! This is NOT A DVD RECORDER!!,"Nowhere does this state that this is a DVD recorder. It says it it a DVR which stands for Digital Video Recorder. It records video on it's internal hard drive. The picture doesn't show a DVD slot. You cannot make a DVD with this. Go here if you want to burn DVD's: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/audio-video/1036920/audio-video/0/1/ref=pd_kb_ln_0/002-7805121-4532853?ts-parent-id=172514"">DVD Recorders</a>[...]"
2,Japanese comedy zombie flick,"This film is a mostly played for the comedy value the effects are pretty good but the acting is so so, it is not bad for a drinking game film but would be hard to watch stone cold sober."
4,REAL music,"Jerry Joseph is the most under rated musician I know of. Live, Jerry and the J Mo's hold nothing back, giving their all to the audiance until the guilty and joyous recipiants can't help but dance. Jerry solo ranks up with the best singer/songwriters of our day. Why this matters to you is this album, Goodlandia, is a collection of live recordings... most in the ""Unplugged"" style from a live performance on a radio station in Portland, OR. All of the tracks on this CD are good, some are great, especially ""Love Like Water"". The cherry on top of this CD is the extended version of ""The Road to Damascus"", full bore electric, recorded in a bar in Bozeman, MT. If you haven't seen Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormons live, and you get the chance, treat yourself. If you can't, definately buy this album."
5,The Third Set IS a Charm!,"I realize my review comes much later than others. I had seen a couple of Foyle's War episodes on PBS, but never realized the number of episodes existed until recently.I appreciate a prior reviewer's pointing out the chopped-up mess that PBS will make of series such as this. It will come as a pleasant surprise to purchasers of these boxed sets that the missing parts have been restored.DVD quality is superb to these old eyes. I am delighted to purchase these knowing they will last much longer than our old VHS tapes!One more note--these boxed sets are somewhat chronological, so start with Set 1 and work your way through.We are fortunate that at least our British cousins have the taste to produce work of this quality, and that we share-basically-the same language!"
5,Foyle's War Series 3,Excellent as always. It is a shame BBC did not continue the Series after year 4.
5,Foyle's War series 3,"This is an excellent presentation of Britain in the War years, its a very important part of the series and you'll want to view it over again,just in case you missed something the first viewing.FOYLE'S WAR"
5,Foyles War Set 3,"This DVD set, as with the first two sets, is well made with good picture and sound quality. All five sets are well acted with realistic characters and authentic World War II story lines. If you like mystery stories in atypical English settings, Foyle's War will not dissapoint you."
1,Not good value!,"At the same time I bought Foyle's War I bought 'Fortunes of War', the complete set for $12.99. I finally opened the pack of Foyle's War, which cost $47.99 and was dissapointed to see there were only 4 episodes!Two series of Foyle's War have run in Australia on the ABC, I would think 4 episodes would be around 1/3 of a series.Whilst I love Foyle's War, a very well made series, I frankly think the Set3 is very expensive, and is misleadingly advertised as I assumed I would at least get one series (12 episodes)."
5,Foyles War Series 3,"A wonderful program, Michael Kitchen is a great actor perfectly suited to his lead role."
5,Rock the Console!,"The Final Fantasy series has some great music to be sure; some of my favorite tracks of this particular game is the Atma/Statue music track (The Decisive Battle) as well as Dancing Mad, in my view, perhaps THE best track there is to be had on this CD set. The opening is also a fine track. Well to be noted is that, on Game Informer's top 100 games of all time, Final Fantasy VI was the highest ranked RPG and also within the top ten--number 7, in fact. If you're an RPG fan and truly appreciate good game music, buy this soundtrack. If you're biased against earlier consoles because you're a later player, than I pity you. Final Fantasy VI really is a cut and more above the rest."
3,I love this book! BUT...,"I really like this book; it is truly the only book of its kind. I am always picking mine up. So, now you're wondering if I like it so much why only three stars? BECAUSE, it is a great coffee table book and very fun BUT, I wish there was more. More details on manufacturers, more photos of the various models made through the years and more details on when they were made and where. It is a great book and I really thank Jim Beloff for writing it - I just want more!"
3,Not excellent but good enough.,"The book contains about 95% of what you need to know for the mcat; however, I found that there are not enough example problems in the book. Some topics are not covered in enough detail (especially the physics section). The biology section is excellent. I discovered that it is best to study both this Kaplan text and the Princeton review text. Princeton has many examples and the language is easier to follow because of the examples, but the Princeton text does not cover as many topics. Both books complement each other very very well though. I definitely do not advise using only the Kaplan book."
1,slot i book,"as an older coach, now retired, i found the coach's guide to the slot I OFFENSE offensive. written on the third grade level it appears to be a justification for why the author used the slot i : rather than a teaching tool, which the title implys. if one wants to learn how to run the I, get kramers 1967 book. i first used the slot I, in 1968, because pre season injuries dictated a formation change. i purchased this book as a curiousity. i wanted to know if i had missed something years ago. good thing this book cost 99c, as i only gave up97c. if i sound harsh, check out the articles i had published in: athletic journal, scholastic coach, and texas coach during the 1980s. jack stanley"
2,Lasted less than a year,"The can looks good, and for a couple of months it even works. I live alone, so the product hardly got a huge workout. But before I'd had it for even a year, the motor died. Don't buy this -- get a Simple Human can. They're much better made."
1,DZT 50-9 touchless trashcan,"We bought this model a little over a year ago. However, it has been some months since the sensor worked properly. We had trouble with the manual close button on the sensor. After about 6 mos. it quit. The manual open sensor was next to go. The trashcan did open with the sensor, but if I had a bit of trash to put in there I needed to turn the can off and open the lid. When I finished I had to turn the can back on. Now the sensor and motor are not working. I think with the amount of money you pay for this it should work for more than a year. Also, I have searched their website and they do not offer a replacement lid for this model. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,"Good idea, bad product","Bought this trash can with high hopes, but after 6 months the sensor on the lid went crazy. The lid would constantly open and close on its own without the sensor being triggered. After cleaning the sensor, changing the batteries and doing everything else I could think of, the trash can was officially broken. Now I am looking for a step can and I would advise anyone looking for a touch less can to use your money towards something that will last more that six months."
3,Overpriced and annoying,"Yeah it is pretty heavy duty stainless steel.Yeah it open up when you wave you hand in front of it. Cute!It quickly becomes annoying when the dog, cat, aunt, neighbor walk in front of it and opens up too.Maybe it was because we have limited places in our kitchen to put it out of the way of traffic but it just seemed to open up and slam shut for random reasons. I quickly was renamed the ""kitchen shark"", and we painted some teeth on it.After a year the hinge on the back started to crack and we just kept it shut off and opened it manually. Eventually the hinge completely broke and we are now searching for a new kitchen trash can after 2 years. ""Manual step this time""! I don't like the idea of batteries anyway and am trying to limit the use. You know Green and all that...Seemed like a chunk of change to drop on a can that really didn't last that long."
3,"It's hard to get excited about a trashcan, but...","I'd read reviews of similar products and it sounds like they tend to open/close erratically, arrive with dents, or quickly break. This one was in perfect shape when it arrived and it works exactly like I hoped for. Now to see how long the batteries last...Note from two years later - still works and not one problem with it.And from slightly later - it broke after slightly more than two years. These are so convenient that I ordered another one. It lasted a year and broke in the same fashion as the first one. I just ordered a third one and downgraded my review to three stars. These are really convenient but the design flaw that causes the lid to crack results in a short life for the product. And you can't order just the replacement part."
3,Not good with dogs...,"One of my standard poodles figured out how to put his head over the sensor, the can would open...Walla! The Promised land! I took the batteries out, but then he knocked the can over.Joe"
2,Didn't last,"I don't know what my family of four did to this can, but the automatic lid quit working after about three months. No amount of jimmying or battery replacement would help. Disappointing."
1,Waste of money.,"Cheap materials. Lasted six months, then hinges and plastic lid broke.Will not buy anything from itouchless again."
1,Touchless Trashcan is Great,This item is really nice especially when you are preparing a meal as you don't have to wash your hands every time you throw items out. The batteries have not had to be replaced yet. It is a neat gadget!
4,great product,"manual overide lets you leave it open while cooking, thenback to motion controlled at a touch of a button. Very handy"
4,Touch Free is Best,"I love this trash can. I just walk by, wave my hand and up pops the lid. I like that I don't have to touch the lid and I can also put a handful of trash in at the same time because I just have to wave over the sensor and the lid pops up!"
4,Touch-Free Stainless Steel Trash Can,"Absolutely wonderful. It's the second one I purchased. I just wish this product had replacement parts. The company shipped right on time, no delay, exactly what was expected."
5,Henry Cooper is the best of the new crop of blues musicians!,Henry Cooper has a unique style that makes him the greatest about to be discovered blues player around. Now that he has formed his own band and produced his first CD I expect him to become a house hold name. If you are lucky enough to see him proform you are in for a great night. Make sure you buy an extra copy of this CD - it is destined to be a collector's item!
4,"I live in Colombia, South America","I live in Colombia, and one of my hobbies is astronomy, It's great to have a sky chart for the southern hemisphere. this edition is not the ideal bu I find it very useful to our environment, and the other aspect is tha it also come in Kindle edition."
3,Gift of stars,"This book is a gift, so the person it's for could do a better review than me. However, several star boooks only mention the southern hemisphere and after much searching I found this one which emphasizes it."
4,Not a bad title,Picked this up to help learn the constellations of the southern sky. For that purpose it certainly is a good read and a nice title. It wont point you to many deep sky objects or much from the various deep sapce objects catalogs however so if you are looking to purchase this for the purpose of finding DSOs then you should probably look elsewhere and go for some quality DSO style star charts instead.
4,Great Response,"The best thing about this album is ""I'm Not Ready to Make Nice,"" their response to all the backlash they experienced from being critical of William. It's a great song about being willing to stand your ground regardless of the cost. As usual, the music, vocals, and harmonies are incredible. But on this album, the gutsy lyrics lead the way."
4,Be careful,"While the Dex drive may very well be VERY handy, keep in mind that computers are not defect-free. So, when transferring/ saving files to your computer, be careful. I would suggest that you connect this piece to a cmputer WITHOUT internet connection. Computers are open to viruses that can destroy your files, and sometimes prevent access to your computer altogether. Not to mention, people can hack your computer. If you're going to connect it to a computer with the internet anyway, at least back up your game files by saving them to floppy disks, or emailing them to yourself."
5,"If you have a Playstation, then this is a must-have tool.","The DexDrive is the best thing you can buy for your Playstation. Having what is virtually a unlimited amount of memory cards is enough of a reason to pick one up, but the best reason is to swap game saves over the net. That feature can be priceless at times. Before you pick one up, make sure that you have the right serial port needed to plug one into your computer."
1,Can pop music get any worse?,"I think it is safe to say that I have the people behind ""Now! That's What I Call Music"" series to blame for compilations like ""Totally Hits"" and ""Got Hits"". It is moments like this when I wish that singles were still being marketed as opposed to these godawful compilations. What makes ""Got Hits"" the worst of its competition is that some of the songs on this album is a few years old. At least Now! uses the current hits, not outdated hits like Paula Abdul and Kylie Minogue. Even the Coldplay song ""Yellow"" is old. I wouldn't buy this cd if it was the last cd on earth and I had nothing to listen to on a deserted island."
3,Tough recalled memories of a fighter pilot,"By Parks own admission, the memories are hazey, and are patched together in this vague account of an American fighter pilot operating out of Port Moresby and later inland New Guinea. Stumbling along, he recalls ""soirees"" over the hills and mountains, the ocassional dogfight encounter and the bad landings on roughly made airstrips. An easy read, though not truly compulsive, but appealing to anyone interested in the subject."
3,Watch it for Furness's portrayal,"I bought this because I'm a Hugh Jackman fan (who isn't?), and it's marketed as a Hugh Jackman film, but that's just marketing. See it, but see it because of the ensemble, not just Jackman. It was the pilot for an Australian series starring Jackman's future real-life wife, Deborra-Lee Furness. It's clearly ""TV,"" not big screen. But Furness is positively luminescent; her acting is straight and true, she's gorgeous but still ""real."" One can see why Jackman totally fell for her. I recently saw her in Jindabyne (2006) and she's simply an excellent actress, well worth watching. Jackman is there, but doesn't get to flex his acting muscles the way he does in later stuff. William Zappa, as an emotionally tortured prison guard, is so believable you both ache for him and want to punch him out. Unfortunately their technical advisors didn't bother to research the real way pros hold handguns, but oh well. I suggest renting it."
4,Rat Tamer indeed,"Good early work by Hugh Jackman that just left me wanting to know the rest of the story. This is a pilot for an Australian TV show that can't be bought in the US. Lots of subplots and side stories going on here too, so if you're only interested in Jackman you're going to be skipping forward a lot, like I did."
1,what a mess,"I only saw more snow and grain in corn field.Transfer is atrocious, and I never made it past the opening 30 seconds.Come on...if you are going to release DVDs, please make them viewable. We have he technology.And I am a Jackman fan."
5,the rat tamer,"GREAT SERVICE ,QUICK DELIVERY ,CORRECT DESCRIPTION , AS A QUITE LARGE BUYER OF WINNING MOVIES OVER THE NET , IT IS VEY GOOD TO KNOW THAT THEIR PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HONOUR ,,TO DO WHAT THEY THEY SAID THEY WOULD.THANKSTOBY"
3,The First Biographic Film,"J. Edgar Hoover, 1986 filmI remember seeing this film on TV many decades ago. I thought it did a good job on de-mythologizing its subject. Too bad its not widely available."
4,"See, Think, and Act differently!","I think this book will help you understand ""How do people behave in this world from a different prospective"" .Thus, enables you to control or even achieve your goals differently. In short, a book worth buying!"
4,Good Pin.,"Good lapel pin. The picture is very accurate and looks just like the product. Hallow on the back side, but is very sturdy. Pin part is located towards the top of the back side, and not the middle, to help it stay right side up when worn. Fast shipping. Would buy from again. Also, environmentally friendly!"
2,NOT ALL REGGAETON IS ABOUT SEX AND VIOLENCE,"For the review that states all reggaeton is about sex, EDUCATE YOURSELF...because it is not. A reggaeton song that hit BIG in 05 was ""Te Vas"" By Glory on the ""Glou/Glory"" Album, that was not about sex or violence...there is alot more reggaeton songs that arent only about sex and violence. Anyways, Cd was alright...Check out Glory's Cd!!!!!! La Dama de Reggaeton!!"
2,not completely appropriate for children,"I almost bought this CD for my son until I realized that the songs were not completely edited for children. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and I now live in the USA. This music is very contagious, I really like the rhythms, but some of the lyrics are not appropriate for kids under 13yrs old. For example; the song ""cae en la noche"" the kids keep saying ""p---ta"", growing up that was a very bad word that I could loose my teeth if my parents heard me saying that. On another song, there is a lot of reference to kissing and hugging(boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing)and lastly there is one song that is sending regards to all the convicts,I don't think that you want your child to think that being a convict is cool. I am not saying that you shouldn't buy this CD, the music is great but think about, if you buy it, listen to it first and talk to your children about what you think. Isn't that what parenting is all about?"
1,Este disco es una mierda,"Este disco esta hecho por abusadores de ninos, forzandoles a cantar temas totalmente inapropiados para su edad. Faltan el respeto a la cultura superior hispana, ponen una direccion de interne que no existe, mutilan el bello idioma espanol malpronunciando y confundiendo la ""L"" con la ""R"" con la ""J"", y esta lleno de musica tropical que me da nausea. Mi esposa compro esta porqueria para mi hija. Apenas pude, lo queme en la parrilla el 4 de julio pasado. la carne sabia a saran wrap, pero al menos las mentes de mis hijas estan aun sanas."
3,Correction to last review,"I heard the ""Cae La Noche"" song, and it does not says ""p---ta"" as the reviewer tells. What the song says is ""muñeca"" (doll, in good ol'Spanish).My wife tells me that the songs on this CD were edited for content (kids are the ones singing on it), and it's more like a reggaeton sing-along type of production for kids.I'm not a Reggaeton lover, so don't expect from me a review on the moral quality or messages of the songs."
4,Easy does Not mean for Beginners,"This is a great book if you already know how to read drawings, but no step-by-step instruction are included in the individual plans. What it does have is a lot of great ideas and information, such as how to build a hinged pole to make cleaning easy and what size hole to bore for the type of bird you want to nest. The drawings illustrate how to make the birdhouses easy to clean and maintain, as well as dimensions for each part. If you have made at least half a dozen woodworking projects, you can make the ""easy"" birdhouses. If you are an intermediate level woodworker, you can make the ""advanced"" projects."
3,Making Birdhouses Easy and Advanced Projects by Gladstone Califf,"This book has 79 pages, is about 6.25"" high by 8.75' wide. It has 34 different drawings for ""advanced project"" birdhouses and 18 additional drawings for ""easy"" to build birdhouses. These drawings provide adequate dimensions and information that a person familiar with woodworking could build each birdhouse. I like the easy to build designs better because they look more traditional, some of the advanced designs are a little more unusual and more decorative. Besides these individual drawings, it covers general topics related to building birdhouses like: Essentials of a Birdhouse, Finishing Birdhouses, Don'ts for Birdhouse Builders, Ventilation, Cleaning, etc. Besides drawings for Wren, Bluebird, and Martin houses (as well as houses for many other types of birds), it has a paragraph or two on the size and important features of houses for these birds."
1,if you have a kindle this isn't for you,"Very disappointed! I have been looking for a kindle book that gave us instructions on how to build birdhouses. I thought since this book was in a kindle format it would give very good instructions, patterns..etc. Not so with this book! Oh there's drawings alright but you can't read them (way too tiny!) If someone puts out at ebook they SHOULD take the time and make everything readable so one can actually build the thing they say one can build when purchasing their book!"
2,alaska birds,Haven't built any of the house yet. Got it so my order would be over XX$ to get free shipping. Has some good ideas & plans. Will probably build a purple martin hose close to one in the book.
4,Warrior Mind!,"I read about the military using meditation to help their soldiers with PTSD and found this book on deep discount shortly thereafter. It's very interesting, and when I told my kids I was going to teach them ""Warrior Mind"" they got pretty excited and are into it so far. My daughter, seven, is especially excited."
1,clean up your act,tea purchase included an order of butter cookies which were shipped with an 8/24/12 exp date when shipped on 9/21/12 znd reeked of coffee even after opening the plastic seal. TWINGS TEA is always good but i would never order thru this particular comany again. have a nice day!!!!
4,label?,Why was there a label on the can? The can is the best part.I hope my sister can get the label off without damaging the print on the can.
4,"It's a useful, up-to-date reference.","Buy this before it goes out of print. It has all the naughty words and a number of expressions you won't find in more dated references. There is info on the origin of the word and its degree of vulgarity, familiarity, etc. A number of definitions use British slang, which can be baffling to American readers, like this one."
2,Deceptive ad!,"I just received this, and it comes w/out a battery. No mention of this in the specs, and the battery is an extra $40-60! Also, it is very light duty for such a tool. The instructions show an example of sharpening a knife..... the existence of a tool like this implies that it would be capable of cutting through a steel rod...!?Ripoff!"
5,"Well-made, charming puppet",My toddler adores this octopus and has been requesting us to tickle-attack her with it for months. It looks really neat since each of your five fingers moves one of the octopus's legs. Well-made. Says surface wash but I have laundered it in the washing machine in cold water and air-dried; no problem. I also like that the Folkmanis puppets come with a tag giving basic facts about the animal.
1,My grandaughter asked for an octopus but showd little interest in this item after about 1 minute,"My grandaughter wasa really in the ""octopus"" This was my son's recommendation to get her an octopus thing of some sort. It was a disaster. My grandaughter was disinterested immediately and hasn't as much looke at it since. It was a waste of money... Stan"
4,+ 1/2 stars...The Seldom Scene Machine Keeps on Rollin',"This is the first Seldom Scene album I purchased following the departure of original guitarist John Starling. I needn't have worried. Phil Rosenthal filled his shoes nicely and on this 1983 outing contributes four songs including the opening track ""A Girl I Know,"" the energetic ""Open the Window, Noah"" and the gospel number ""The Weary Pilgrim."" His other contribution is the melancholy ""Winter Wind."" Among the other highlights are a fine rendition of Jackson Browne's ""Jamaica, Say You Will"" and another Paul Craft gem ""Born of the Wind."" (Craft wrote the classic ""Through the Bottom of a Glass"" which appeared on 1974's OLD TRAIN.) Everything you expect from the Seldom Scene is here--close harmony singing, impeccable song selection, and first-rate musicianship. [Running Time - 31:54] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,A small book of some historic importance,"This book is a monument to one of mid-century's great conservation battles. It doesn't tell you anything about the battle to save Echo Park and Split Mountain canyon from dams. Its authors were all involved in that fight, and they won. But this book was simply meant as a guide to Dinosaur National Monument's resources. Those resources were little known and under-appreciated. They remain so today.The writing style and concerns are dated - - this was written in the early 1950s, after all. There are many black-and-white photos and a few color plates, but you can find better ones elsewhere. There is a good guide book to the area, and two good books about the Echo Park controversy.So this book is really just of historical interest. If you're an antiquarian or a scholar, you'll enjoy it. Most people should get one of the more recently-published books (see my Amazon list for those)."
2,Flat sound takes the feeling out of their music,"I'll bet this band rocks in person, but on this cd they sound flat and numb. Were they nervous in the studio? Was their sound over-produced to make it more pop? Probably the latter. In any case, this album is much like a thousand other albums out there: decent, unorginal, and spiritless."
3,Book for Boaters,"I have recently been trying to find great/simple recipes to cook on my propane stove while at my rustic cabin - this book sounded perfect! Well it is, if you do most of your camping on a boat or you are an avid fisher. It IS a wonderful resource for preparing for cooking on a boat or in small spaces, and has some great recipes, but if you're looking for R.V. or camping recipes - look elsewhere."
1,Not recommended,The unit took about a month to be delivered from Seiko. After using it for several months I have found that it does not even have common words and phrases. It would be of no help to try to use it in a Spanish speaking country.
2,Missing alot of words,Disappointed with the lack of words. Every 3rd or 4th word I looked up was not in the dictionary.
1,"Not worth it, really.","I bought this because of the conjugation feature, the price and the amazing reference to ""over 800,000 translations"". The conjugation feature is the only thing that keeps me from tossing it in the trash bin. The vocabulary is extraordinarily limited. The huge number of translations can be explained by the fact that each verb is conjugated at least 16 different ways for each of 11 different ""persons"", not including the infinitive. So a single verb knocks out at least 177 of your 800,000 translations. The keys are hypersensitive, so it's far too easy to enter typos and time consuming to go back and retype. I would not buy another one and believe it would be virtually useless in country."
2,LCD display failed after 2-3 usage!!! Warranty work in Japan!!,"Bought this unit for it's portability, price, and functionality (dictionary and phrases). However, not many usable phrases, and the LCD failed after only a few usages. Also, the warranty card indicates that it will need to be mailed back to Japan for warranty repair!"
2,Great product; needs better LCD component,"This translater is great because it is accurate and very compact. This was actually the second one I had bought. Unfortunately there seems to be a problem with the LCD component, as that failed in both of my units."
3,ok rack,"It's a nice looking rack, but it was tricky to get it installed firmly. I've been using mine for about 8 months and no problems until recently when I put my bike on the rack (it's a trek 1500 with an Alpha Superlight Race frame...not heavy) and the bead on the end of one of the cables came off. I like the rack so I've ordered a replacement cable set, but I'm still disappointed that it broke."
4,"Low cost, modern bike rack with a few drawbacks","This is a pretty nice looking, modern bike rack and shelf. Other reviews are right in that the materials feel pretty cheap. I decided not to use the screws that came in the box. Instead I used some expansion drywall anchors. They're holding the bike (about 20 lbs) and bike helmet nicely. I'm a bit worried that the cables supporting the full weight of my bike may not hold up to years of use. One cable is slightly longer than the other causing more weight to be on the longer cable.Yes, there are better, higher quality shelves out there, but you'll have a hard time finding one for $30. In my opinion it's a good rack for the money."
2,Poor design and quality,"I purchased this rack to hang my road bike (it's carbon and very light). Within two weeks, the ball bearing at the end of one of the ropes came off and it wasn't fixable. I tried tying the wire around the hook where the ball used to slide in, but it wouldn't stay. I ended up throwing it away and purchasing a different rack. I would not recommend this product."
3,A Bit Small,"I should have checked the size more carefully. This pan is suitable for heating one or two pieces of previously prepared pizza but not big enough to use for a full sized scratch pizza. I was attracted to it because it could use square pizza dough but I should have checked the size. It's fine if you are looking for a small pan but measure twice, order once."
4,Toaster Oven Helper,This works great for heating up leftover pizza and french bread pizza. It is a little on the smaller side for my toaster oven though.
4,pizza crisping sheet,I was expecting the product to be somewhat larger in size. However it is a good product just too small.
5,GREAT little pan!,"I LOVE this little pan. I butter/garlic/cheese up some sour dough slices and put this pan under the broiler. The bread is ""crisp"" on both sides. No more soggy limp left over pizza either. Still need to try it with left over fries, but I'm pretty confident that it will work great. I am thinking about getting another one."
2,Cute but too small,"I purchased the most wonderful toaster oven for my kids and then ordered a few items to go with it. This is a very cute, useful item but is way too small for the toaster over. I guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. Can't put many tater tots on this one."
1,Only for one piece,Way too small for a family use. Dimensions are not listed in the description. They should be so people can make the decision if it is large enough.
5,Good item for small convection ovens,Works great for small pizzas in my Cuisinart convection oven. It dose what it says; browns the bottom while cooking the top. Mini pizzas come out perfect.
4,nice item for the size,"This is a nice item for a small size toaster oven. My oven is a 6-slice; however, so it is a bit small for it. It is exactly like the picture and crisps a french toast pizza very nicely."
4,Does the job,"Don't expect it to make the most use of the space in your toaster oven, because this sheet is relatively small.However, considering the few makers of toaster size accessories, this is decent, along with the similar sized baking/grilling pan from the same manufacturer.Though I've only used it once so far, be aware, as others have mentioned, this is not a ""top quality"" product. Under the toaster oven heat after about 15 minutes it warped sort of diagonally. Once it cooled off, it did go back to its original shape, but it is something to consider."
5,Heather did a great job again...,"Heather did a very good job again... I've viewed her tapes before and like her style of training. I read Sybex guide and it works very well with that guide.... ... the CCNA is more like a super ""Network Essentials"", and the heavy ""Cisco- centric"" stuff doesn't happen until more advanced exams (and I DO have Cisco experience!!!) END"
1,"A sad, sad piece of equipment","very cheap version of a porter cable by Campbell Hausfield. I had one day's experience with it. I would like to have had more but it could not handle nailing 1/4"" panel board up and broke about 4 hours into the project. From the beginning it misfired like crazy.I sent it back and got a porter cable. More money but the job is done and it's ready for the next.I've had trouble with other Campbell Hausfield products before with the exception of the cast iron compressors. they are great"
4,Great gun for the price so far...,"I have only used once so far and the gun performs great. No jams, the oil free is very nice and it uses very little air which is great since I only have 1 gal compressor. The only issue I've found is when the compressor comes on to refill the tank, the gun won't completely sink the 2"" brad. Just something to get used to. I had an older Coleman gun that came with my compressor that lasted 3 plus years with fairly heavy use, I hope this performs even better. Time will tell...."
3,Works good when it works.,"I'm a bit disappointed in this tool. I bought it for installing tongue and groove car siding, to the ceiling in our rec room. Thankfully, it worked good thru that project. However, I've used it only a couple times since then, maybe a total of 2000 nails thru it, and it already started malfunctioning. Of course, it was out of warranty by then. I had to call the comapany and order a replacement part. At least they were helpful and shipping was fast. The part wasn't too expensive either. I don't think I'd order this brand again. However, it was still cheaper than renting one."
1,Sleigh bells do not make it a Christmas song,Stay away from this CD and it's companions (Holiday Tribute to AC/DC and Green Day). I bought them for less than $2 apiece and still got ripped off. The arrangements are cheezy keyboard dominated lounge tunes. Every song has sleigh bells being shaken in the background and that is it for being Christmas related. I am a confirmed Yule Head and have hundreds of Christmas recordings from piano rolls to the latest hip hop and every genre in between and these are the lamest of the bunch. What a complete waste of product.
2,Horrid translations makes this a bad text,"This book has absolutely atrocious translations of some of the older texts. Here's an example from Epicurus' Letters to MenoeceusThis text reads""For it is then that we have need of pleasure, when we feel pain owing to the absence of pleasure; (but when we do not feel pain), we no longer need pleasure.""Every other translation reads something like""When we are pained because of the absence of pleasure, then, and then only, do we feel the need of pleasure. ""That completely reverses the meaning of the text. I have never seen a book filled with so many ham fisted translations. I can't recommend this book to any professor who hopes to teach their students well, or any reader who hopes to understand these texts properly."
3,Well...,"To be honest, this book is filled with a whole lot of nonsense (and it's really big too, so there's also a whole lot of it). But if philosophy is what you're in to...."
4,college book,The book came on time and at a good price! I will buy from them again if they have the books I need.
4,Very Good Used Book,"This book was a gently used book almost like new.... There was one thing that was a mistake in the descripiton which was ""no highlighting"": I think one or two pages were so it's no big deal but other than that the book was clean and barely used look like... I'm happy with the purchase for the price and looks...."
5,Excellent Condition!,"I ordered this book to save money for college and it worked!! My book arrived in excellent condition, just in time for me to head off to school. There was some pencil writing on the first page, but it definitely didn't bother me at all. I'm definitely doing this again next semester. :)"
1,Product Does Not Work!,I followed the instructions to the letter... The soldering iron does not heat up.The manufacturer -- Wall Lenk Corporation -- does not have an 800 number or even an email address on their web page.Very Sad.
1,Not as good as weller equivelent,"When I received it it would not light, damaged igniter part. Fixed it myself. Takes a long time to heat up and does not offer the convenience of standing up like the Weller equivelent. The Weller is a better choice....Sorry Wall"
1,"HORRABLE, it couldnt get any worse then this.",do not waste your time or money with this cheezy 80's crap. it is just a collection of garbage and lameness with some cheezy 80's chicks rubbing themselves while sitting on a bike. it shows about 2 minutes of bikes then launches into this lame video of a chick trying to be hot for 10 minutes. this was hard to sit through. it remided me of something you would find at a dollar store. this went from my dvd player stright into the donation pile.
4,"A Star is not Born, but becomes","A smart fun film about the film industry and an actor whose star is falling. He takes to mentoring a young actress. Ching Wan Lau struts scruffy-cool all the way through, good enough to make this seem like it's really about him. Siyan Huo, as the mentored one, portrays good character arc from naive and quirky to strong-willed and independent. Good performances and good writing elevate this above simple cynical insider display."
5,Educational book,"I am appreciating the writer for his effort. Reading this book is very educational,as a matter of fact I am suggesting this book to students majoring in political science who are interested in Iranian's political and social life as it was in the past, in the present and will be in the future.I have reviewed comments made by others,it is surprising how some mentaly retarded people such as Lawrence Ershaghi take the advantage of this site only to carry the will of their Master!Lawrence, take your time and read at least a few pages of this book, I am sure it will help you to have a better understanding on Iran."
2,"Fine on 32 bit, but 64 bit forget it!","Worked great on my old 32bit Windows XP node, but when I upgraded to a new one with 64bt Windows 7, wouldn't work."
2,"Better off with a ""Playstation"" brand controller","The analog function doesn't work as smoothly as an actual ""Playstation"" analog controller and it rattles when it vibrates. After a while the buttons you use a lot can start to stick (like the ""X"" button on mine). The program function is kind of confusing at first and hard to get ""just right,"" but after a while its not so bad, and the auto-fire option can be really helpful at times."
5,Baracude 2 - Better than SONY Dual Shock,"The shock functionality is more powerful than the SONY Dual Shock and I have not experienced the ""rattling"" that the other review mentioned. It feels better and more ""refined"" in my hand than the SONY one.I have had mine over a year with HEAVY usage and it is still going strong. I especially like the ability to toggle several analog modes such as the ability to use the RIGHT analog stick for the same functions as the LEFT one; this way, I can play with only one hand (very useful for RPGs like FFVII, VIII) ... drinking my beverage of choice in my left...I have experienced only ONE incompatible game (MONKEY MADNESS) which couldn't detect it for some reason.. but am able to use it with every other sports, action/fighting, RPG, etc game...I personally also like the ""connected"" d-pad vs. the disjoint 4 button d-pad on the regular SONY.I HIGHLY recommend this over SONY model and the MADCAT dual shocks"
1,Don't bother,"You can feel the ""flimsiness"" the moment you take it out of the box. This controller can withstand very little of the normal day-to-day punishment a serious gamer dishes out. Response is mediocre and the buttons can stick sometimes.Spend the extra few $ and get a real Playstation Dual Shock controller. You'll be glad you did."
4,Back to the time of champagne and roses,"Au bordel! Au bordel! Un richiamo irrefrenabile, che porta alla memoria la Parigi liberale degli anni Venti. ""Elle écarta largement les cuisses..."" mentre una piccola orchestra suona in sottofondo ""et sa chaleur s'engloutit dans mon corps"". Per realizzare quest'evocazione sonora del bordello parigino, Stephen Winter ne ha ricostruito gli ambienti (documentati da uno splendido libretto) e li ha popolati di antichi protagonisti e suoni perduti. Tra amplessi, fisarmoniche, champagne e lingerie profumate.Arthur Cravan"
2,Biggest budget-fewest laughs,"This one is a real stinker for several reasons. First, the gags are often dumb and Costello milks each one so they go on and on. Second, the story is a confused mess so you care about nothing. Third, The whole thing seems to go on forever and there's only one song! On the plus side, the silver ore routine, the bullfighting finale, and Bud tearing Lou's clothes off are all funny. But this dog out barks the few laughs."
1,Hellish Hayride,"Extremely dissapointing film with Bud and Lou heading south of the border(for some reason not made entirely clear). You'd think Mexico would be a gold mine for these guys, but they squander the oppurtunity. The main problem is that Costello tries to play it straight. A major dissappointment."
5,Chicago Bears Mug,I am very happy with my order of the Chicago Bears Mug. I rated it a 5. It was all that I read that it would be. I would highly recommend it.
2,"ok, but I wouldn't buy it",I agree with Sachmo...his analysis is how I saw the book as well. I've been developing requirements from the system level down to the subsystem level for a number of years and I found this too broad. I am not sure someone who is starting out in requirements could grasp it. I only bought the book for a graduate course. This book was hard for me to read.
2,Time To Stop Printing,"I buy a lot of books from amazon, and I rarely make any comments. The material and style of this book are outdated, and it is vague on content. The authors should make a revised version, or the book should no longer be printed.Bottom line, do not buy it! I am returning my copy."
5,Excellent combination of systems analysis and psychology,"This is the best book on systems analysis I have ever read. It combines thoughtful and experienced systems analysis with wonderful insight into how people think, create, and perceive the world around them, based on a background in humanistic psychology. It provides many practical tips on how to get things started, generate creativity, consider alternatives, understand and define needs and goals, and reach decisions. It emphasizes a proper understanding of the role of ambiguity in different stages of a project. I have reread it many times and continue to learn much each time I open it."
4,About peoples and requirements,"I own this book because Suzanne Robertson make a lot of references to it and I liked a lot her book. In fact, this book is not about process, it's about how to investigate, how to interview and communicate with people to get the information. Gause & Weinberg probably highlight the most important point in requirements engineering : how to manage groups ? How to get the information ? How to manage uncertainity ? Easy to read and helpfull."
2,Useful - but for whom?,"The book is historically informative but clearly biased. Among other things, it suffers from two flaws. First, it does hardly mention the other minorities that used to live, more or less peacefully, in Kosovo (before NATO decided to install the KLA as its puppet regime, that is). Second and in relation to the first flaw, it occasionally falls for the propaganda-claim that in the 1990s Kosovo's inhabitants were 90% Albanian, a claim that Vickers herself flatly contradicts by saying that an estimated 400.000 Albanians (most of them from Kosovo) had left Yugoslavia already by 1993. But the numbers game is rather fishy business in any case, since its function has been the support of the exclusive Albanian claims on the province."
5,Deserves more than one star,"This is just another review to jack up the reader review rating of this book, since as noted by some other reviewers, it hardly deserves such harsh panning. Read this and esp. Noel Malcolm's ""Kosovo, A Short History."""
2,Error in your review,"There is an error in your review. Sentence: ""The issue is complicated, Vickers contends, by the presence of many Serb fighters in the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army who are not native to the region,"" is wrong. There are NO Serb fighters in KLA. KLA is an Albanian terrorist organization and all their fighters are Albanian."
1,An ethically problematic book,"This is an tendencious book of very bad informed student who is trying to proove that Kosovo belongs to Albanian no metter how. This work is full of incredible falsifacates, such as this that they are lot of Serb fighters in KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army), and a lot of things about history of Kosovo and Yugoslavia. This nonsense has to proove that this terrorist organisation is legitimate army of all people from Kosovo. While this organisation kills civilians (no metter if they are Serbs or Albenians, it is important that thay are against indipendent Kosovo), this book is problematic in sense of ethic and we have to ask ourselves is it written by the order of someone, for instence of the same KLA."
1,VERY BAD,"Although not as bad as Noel Malcom's book""Kosovo: a short history"". This book is BAD. It is very ANTI-SERBIAN from cover to cover. More revisonist history for the Balkans.This book deserves its many 1star reviews"
4,My High School Scent,"I'm not sure what inspired me to buy this scent when I was in high school other than I thought I was going to score with it. It earned me many a compliment from the young ladies. It's a very spicy scent. Some would consider this a ""night"" scent. I like the very sophisticated smell. And it was really unique. I think it was discontinued because it is very overpowering. And I doubt a lot of people could wear this scent properly, since I think it probably would've matched well with an older person's phermone. Too bad it was discontinued. I still have my bottle, but it doesn't smell the same. I've had it for over 20 years now. Unbelievable."
1,Garbage,"Don't waste your money on this one folks. I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother and it's very defective. The LCD display has two large non functional strips in it, rendering it useless. This occured after only one day of light use. Seiko wants to charge us for the shipping there and back to replace it, which to Japan is pretty pricey."
1,I had to return two!,"I had to return two units because the display was missing lines!I canceled my order. I would rate this item ""0"" star, but you didn't offer this option."
2,Rice's Vocals are Monotonous,"Both Rice and Skaggs are great musicians. However, I found Rice's vocals on this album to be mechanical sounding. I don't know if it was the processing or just his style, but every word seems to have the same quality. When he is singing about something sad, there is no ache. When he sings about something happy, there is no excitement."
5,Alpha and Omega,"This is the simplicity of honest traditional acoustic music done by two masters of their instruments, who by the way harmonize like old brother teams."
5,One of my most played CDs!,"I stumbled on this randomly when the unusual packaging caught my eye - it's attached to a ceramic tile. Seeing that it used a gameboy as an instrument convinced me to give it a try. From the very first track, I instantly fell in love! This is glorious upbeat music. The low-fi acoustic guitar and gameboy combined with the singer's heavenly hi-fi voice is a great sound. After playing this for weeks, I gladly bought the band's full length CD, and it turned out to be a lot of the same songs, but with totally different instrumentation (no gameboy, for one). Now I love both discs! If you have their other album, get this one too. It's totally different but equally great. An undiscovered gem! The Misfits cover is especially classic. So glad I took a chance on this one!"
3,Happy wit purchase,"The part fit and works, cheaper than your local auto parts store. I would have given 5 stars but the one i replaced seemed better quality. The orange part is not solid, its like a cushion material(flexible). The replaced filter had metal aliminum frame, which seemed better quality and sturdy. It looked like it could last another 5 years.Anyway, what do you expect for the price. It works, its affordable, end of story. Given that i only had this product for one month as of today i would buy this again, but well see how good this product is after 12 months.One thought is i don't think after 2+ years of use, this one will look as good as my old filter. Recommended to change every 12 months/xxx miles. My car is 2001 infiniti i30."
3,fram is ok,it does it job which is block air. Nothing new about replaceable air filters far as I can tell. it keeps my car happy so woo whoo
5,Fram CA4309 Rigid Panel Air Filter,"I bought this filter for Altima GXE. The filter is well constructed, and it fits well. Good purchase for the money."
4,Good Engine Air Filter,"Engine air filters keep the large and fine particulate junk out of your engine. After they are in place for a while, they filter out enough junk to begin to obstruct the air flow into the engine, therefore it's a good idea to replace the air filter about the same time one replaces the cabin air filters. With the cost of repairs and fuel in these days, we are well served to take the best care of our engines that we can. These filters are cheap protection for your engine."
4,Filter Replacement,"These filters fit fine, easy to replace and appear to do the job. I have used these filters for several years. Easy to recommend."
1,Air Filter,"Does not fit my truck , wast of time and money , not worth sending back so i just threw away my money for nothing , thanks a lot !"
2,Does not fit 2007 Nissan Altima,"I was misled by Amazon. This filter does not fit a 2007, 4cyl, 2.5L, Nissan Altima and unfortunately it is now past the return date."
2,tsk tsk...,"well, it was ok, not classic 90 lb wuss, it was good but really just not like them and dissapointing if you're looking for the normal 90lb Wuss sound we all know and love. the first two were a lot better."
4,Pink Teresa,"The doll is my favorite...yet.I had one when I was little, but she last a lot of hair=( But she had a pink cap...but my new one dosen`t.Why?"
3,Teresa,Barbie Teresa Doll PERFECT PINKI Had Her When I was a Girl She is Beautiful And I can't wait to get back Again
1,No Disc for me either,"After just a few months and very few uses as a CD only, it has died completely and cannot read any discs, including ones it used to play.Expensive Garbage. No More Sony's. Do NOT buy this one."
1,another one bites the dust,"Second Sony DVD player that died on me. Claims ""NO DISC"" after working fine for a while. There is currently a class action suit being considered against Sony, but surprisingly this model isn't on the list."
1,Died after a year and a half.,"I searched for a while before deciding on this player, and at first I loved it. It played everything beautifully and was so easy to use. I even bought one for my sister when their old one died. Then out of nowhere, this player began skipping all over perfectly good DVDs with no scratches on them. I cleaned it, to make sure, but to no avail. I am never buying another sony DVD player again."
2,Died on me,Same as the others. Worked perfectly and died suddenly for unknown reason.The disk keeps seeking and cannot read anything and then says NO DISK.
4,Problem-free player,"I've had this dvd player since it was released and I use it all the time. I've had no problems with this or any other Sony dvd player. The picture's great and the menu is easy to use.My only minor quibbles are that you can't change the settings without first stopping the dvd. The remote isn't the most intuitive I've ever used. VCD, DIVX playback would've been a nice addition too.The only real complaint I have is that it's LOUD when changing from one disc to another."
2,best 1 year dvd that i ever had,"Really good dvd player and very convinient. carousel dvd changer, you could stay all night in bed just whatching one movie after the other. When it got to be 1 year old stop working like if it was desing it that way. started saying NO DISC like other reviews. nerver work again."
1,Guess I was a bit luckier,"Mine lasted about 3years, which seems to be three times the norm. One day it wouldn't power up so I unplugged it and plugged it back in, hit the power button and it was fine. A month later the same thing happened. Now it won't power up at all. Should I feel lucky mine lasted three times longer than most of them? I don;t think so. I have a Denon AV Receiver which I run all my audio AND VIDEO through. In 10 years I've never even turned it off, it still works perfectly. SONY= Inferior products at inflated prices. Never again."
4,Exciting and secretly important,"Alan Moore's forte, when one examines his work, is clearly not in the standard superhero fare category. He can work quite well within the superhero mold, however, as is evidenced by the perfect Watchmen miniseries. In Captain Britain, Moore manages to lighten to balance between his own artful world and common superheroes. In Watchmen, one can easily forget that the superheroes involved are the same type you'd find in JLA. In Captain Britain, its relatively standard Marvel superhero fare. The story, however, is riveting and far-reaching. Having little experience with Captain Britain, I found the beginning somewhat confusing, but that arc is ended quickly and within five pages another plot is developed. This book is recommended to any fans of Alan Moore, or Captain Britain, but it most likely holds little appeal for more recent comic readers."
3,Maybe for Alan Moore Collectors...,"The original Captain Britain comics are hard for American readers to come by- this trade paperback (it IS the early Alan Moore material) shows some of Moore's earliest published scripts. Coming smack in the middle of a very confusing storyline, the young Moore does as best as he can to bring about some semblance of cohesion to the pedestrian setting. Moore and Davis are both still struggling to find their ""voices"", so to speak. Some of Davis's drawings border of crude, and the experimental nature of some of the artwork adds to the very young feel. Still, CB is presented with good development; Slaymaster and The Fury are presented as formidable foes. For completists and the curious- but definitely neither's strongest early works..."
5,beware these reviews!,"This book is great, but many of these reviewers are writing about the wrong product! This is the volume that directly follows Alan Moore's classic run with Davis on Captain Britain. Alan Davis wrote the stories in this volume, not Alan Moore. Because I paid more attention to the reviewers than the cover image, I now have two copies of the same trade."
3,NOT ALAN MOORE,"I haven't read the book yet, but I read the reviews and they're very misleading because, as someone else said, now that I read ALL the reviews, there are two Captain Britain TPB and this is not the Alan Moore version -- it's Alan Davis, et al with an intro by Chris Claremont.That said, it looks interesting, so I'll update the stars once I read it and will be a bit more careful about looking at Amazon item details . . . and reviews . . ."
3,"Good music, bad sound quality","This is indeed wonderful music and they do it right. The Schubert Trio No 1 is clearly played better than the Archduke. You can feel on piece that they really enjoy playing together.The only drawback, which I find quite anoying, is the sound quality which is close to terrible. If you listen to it through headphones, the noise becomes overwhelming. It definitely worths as a document, not clear if it worths as a music record."
5,The Original Order of the Bible's Books -- How and Why!,The order of the books in our Bible was altered by Church authorities for anti-Semitic reasons. The Jewish Tanakh preserves the original order of Old Testament books -- little known to Christians! No published New Testament orders its books as the apostles arranged them! This book reveals the original manuscript order of the books of Scripture and fruitfully considers why the original canonizers so arranged them. Understanding the divinely inspired order of the books makes the Bible easier to understand!
1,SUCKS,"This was the most boring video I have EVER seen on tv, in a college class, ond dvd, or ANYWHERE else! DO NOT get it unless you ABSOLUTELY have to get it!"
1,Don't Bother,"I turned this pile of ~(a word Amazon will filter)~ off, not even 30 minutes into the film because of how bad the dialog was of a bunch of teenagers trying to act like snot nosed upper class snobs that just make you want to puke.You just don't even care what happens in this as little miss Enchanted princess has a ""coming out party?"" (what the hell?) and a prank goes wrong that kills some ugly friend of hers. It looked like an even more annoying rip off of Cruel Intentions, just played out much more dull.You just see this lame prank go wrong, and don't care what happens after that. Just avoid the movie, take a look at how many copies are for sale at not even a dollar each, and even the collectibles are not asking for much as there pretty much begging you to take it off there hands for free.Don't bother to rent it, and avoid it if it's on TV for free."
2,idiotic but fun(ny),"April Fool's Day 2007. A tragic death takes place. One year later, the people involved get back together to find the person who allegedly has proof about who the murderer is.The script is totally childish, and ridiculously idiotic, but at the same time, it's fun. The actors are pretty lame, still it's a whole bunch of fun.I won't give away the end, but I can just say I kinda figured it out.It's a mindless hour and a half, not a script that requires much thinking.If you've got time to waste, this is just as good as anything."
2,MTV Presents April Fool's Day,"April Fool's Day was a remake of the 1980's film off the time. It features a cast of good looking people that looks like they stepped off a soap opera or MTV. That's one thing I miss about the 80's horror films, the teens in those films looked like real people rather then Hollywood actors. Anyway, a group of friends pull a prank and someone dies. A year later they start to get messages from her. The first death was painfully stupid that it might go down as the worst death scene ever filmed that didnt involve CGI. It's cliche and not worth the time, even though the story was pretty good. The death scenes are some of the worst i've ever seen, right along side Prom Night. Overall, I do not recommend this to serious horror fans. If your some teenage girl who watches MTV alot and looking for a good scare, then this is up your alley."
3,HAPPY APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!,"In honor of today actually being April Fool's Day, I thought I'd write this review. I saw this movie last year after I watched the original. This is very different and not like the original, until the very end. Desiree Cartier is very rich. She is having a party for Torrance Caldwell, who is played by the sexy beautiful Scout Taylor-Compton. Desiree plays a prank, but it all goes wrong and someone dies. A year later, the people responsible for the prank become the targets of a killer, but it's all in good fun because it's APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!"
5,Still a classic,"I read this in college nearly 30 years ago and just re-read it. It's a timeless piece of fantasy that, unfortunately, languished in the shadows of Tolkien which came out just before it. Wolfe was a wordsmith in his own class, masterfully creating layer upon narrative layer to keep drawing you deeper into the narrator's world with a simultaneously detached yet engaging voice. Very hard to describe. It has to be experienced."
4,It's a shame this is out of print!,Goth is back and without this great book. This is the grandest of the anti-hero genere. A torturer is the vilest of villians but this one is a hero. Information is power and the torturers will do anything to attain power. The world is dark and mysterious once again. A must for fantasy alternatives.
3,"interesting, but tragically boring.","Neil Gaiman called this book the greatest fantasy of the past century, and I'm sort of wondering what he was thinking. Particularly because, as Neil Gaiman, he must have read his own books.A Torturer is expelled from his order because he mercy killed a woman he fell in love with. And that's pretty much it. The book is beautifully written, creates a fascinatingly bizarre, original, complex, and dark world, but it is confusingly written with awkward vocabulary and the details bog the story down, never allowing the characters to become real or interesting. The worst thing is that it's just plain boring. Potential is there, but it's just not worth it. Very disappointing. Grade: C"
1,"""Please, not the Book of the New Sun. Anything but the Book of the New Sun!!!""","A few words on Torture:1. Reading this book is an Excruciation.2. I would rather be waterboarded than read this book again.3. Given the choice of reading another book in this series or putting my left eye out with a butter knife, spreading it on toast, and eating it, I would take the eye-toast.I read these gushy reviews by these deeply-intellectual reviewers and I believed.Like the prisoners of the Guild, who hope (hopelessly) to be released without being tortured, I turned each page hoping beyond hope that the boredom and confusion would end; that sense could be made; that there was, indeed, a purpose.It is too late for me, I will bear the scars of this persecution of incomprehensible boredom for years...but there is still time to save yourself!!!Run!!!"
4,If you like the Sunday newspaper crosswords,"I bought this as a gift....it did not go over too well. I now know that some people, who enjoy doing daily newspaper crossword puzzles, do NOT like any Sunday newspaper crosswords. They say they are just too difficult. This is probably a fine book for those people who do like doing the Sunday newspaper crosswords though."
2,Lazy editing,"I love New York Times puzzles and puzzle collections, but this one is a big disappointment. Of the first 37, I had done fully a dozen of them in the last such book I bought. There's really no excuse for such excessive repetition."
3,Type set too small,"I bought this for my Dad's birthday as he loves crossword puzzles. Unfortunately because he is older, his eyesight isn't the best.The puzzle size and typeset is really small and I fear he will struggle to read the clues and insert the letters into the boxes. Too bad as I'm sure the puzzles themselves are very good."
4,"Hard, Challenging, Love/Hate Thing",I love this crossword puzzle book. I like to work on crossword puzzles for days and even weeks. I think this one will take a year!Don't get me wrong... I am enjoying the challenge.I specifically like the larger Sunday puzzles that are themed with hidden clues. They are puzzles within puzzles.My Mom always did crossword puzzles when I was growing up. I'd say that's where I picked up the bug. If you like a challenge buy this book! And - use a pencil!
5,This book is a good starter,"This was the first morton book I read, it got me in to his writing/phtography. His writing about his pictures is much better than any published aircraft photographer I know of. This is a very good book to learn something you didn't know before."
3,not bad,this was my first andew lang. i will read the others and i enjoyed some of the stories...but found myself zoning out and not caring about some. also there were a few that seemed similar placed close together. i did find some cute and funny and it was great to read some other cultures fairy tales
3,Coffee table book -- for students,"If you want a colorful, generalized book about the types of things remote sensing satellites can 'see' and 'detect' this is a book for you. The aerial photography is stunning and the commentary about the photos is well done, although too short and lacking in detail.As there is little 'depth', this is not a book for the academic-minded. It's niche seems to be as a 'coffee table' book, but unfortunately my copy came paperbound (instead of hardcover) so it makes a rather 'floppy' coffee-table package.I would have given 4-stars if the book were hardbound (even if it cost $4 more that way) but, as-is, I'd recommend the paperback edition only for the most budget-minded. However the price is very low and the color reproduction is excellent."
5,"This book could be useful as well as being ""an eye catcher""",This should be a delight to look at as well as useful for all age groups as well as useful to geologists like myself and of course geographers.
3,Relaxing,"One of the problems i have with this workout is that its not very helpful when you are trying to find the beginning. You have to search through to get to the starting point. To get to the 10 minute part you have to surf through all the rest as well.In addition, normal workouts are done as though you are looking into a mirror so the moves are easy to follow. However, with this one you have to re-orient. If the person is doing the move on his right side you can't mirror the moves, you have to mentally remind yourself to do it on your right side and not try to mirror the move. This particularly relates to the part with liver cleanse. You cannot make the movements for cleansing the liver on the wrong side of the body because it just would not work.Apart from that its kinda relaxing but I can't say that it has had any significant impact."
4,Good video with one huge flaw,"I enjoyed this unbox purchase except for one huge flaw. There is one movement where the teachers say ""make a figure 8 with your hands."" OK. Is it vertical, horizontal, on an angle? When do the palms face inward and when do the face outward? The movement is done fairly quickly. Rather than performing it slow so you get the movement, they burn right through it and blame ""intestinal problems"" if you don't get it. No, it's bad teaching for that one movement. The instructors should have clarified and taught that differently. A good teacher teaches they don't just say, ""Oh, do like this"" with no other explanation. I wanted to give this a 5 and should have probably given it a 3, but that is my only frustration (LARGE though it is) with this otherwise good video."
3,Beginning Qigong better,Qi Gong for Cleansing is ok but Qi Gong for Beginners by the Garrapolis is better.
3,Qi Gong a bit boring,"I purchased this based on reviews and although its tutorial style was OK, the sequence flow was all of 10 minutes. The slowness is a bit boring but you do learn the moves. I'm not sure I'll come back to this one often. I'm more interested in Lee Holden and others for Qi Gong. Definitely would welcome feedback on this art and best videos."
3,Not What I Expected,"Although this DVD is entitled ""QiGong for Cleansing,"" I was under the assumption that it would include the QiGong 6 Healing Sounds. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It just goes through a series of slow (quite boring) movements. This type of qigong may work for someone else, but it was not the qigong form I was looking for. I ended up selling back."
5,Excellent Qigong DVD,"This is an exceptionally well done DVD, well thought out and organized to teach the beginner in Qigong (like me). Done in a beautiful setting with the mountains as a background, I was quite pleased with the instruction. Only suggestion for improvement, the volume was a little low, I could barely hear it on my laptop. But this is a minor point."
5,Start your day in the flow,"Great 10 minute practice that one can easily do in the morning even with an extremely busy schedule. It grounds one before going out to face the world and makes you feel good. The 10 minute practice is easy to follow and by doing the longer practice when you have time you know what to visualize while doing the shorter practice. It was just what I needed to round out my other practices of doing yoga, NIA zumbra and body pump a few times every week. Yes, I do work full time (sometimes overtime) in a high stress career. So try it and try Daisy Lee's Radiant Lotus Qigong for Women."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"This is definitely Dino at his best! I'm listening to it as I write this review and the ease and smoothness of his voice is beyond words!Everybody Loves Somebody, Dream, I'm Confessin show Dino at his soulful best - every word he sings he means!I listen to this cd at least once a day!A must have for all Dino fans!"
5,Late nite with Dean Martin,VERY COOL! Lets you listen to some of his more romantic tunes all at once.
4,Wish it came with chairs.,"I love how this table looks and feels. I love how well it folds up. Very easy to use. It's well made. I just wished the chairs came with it. I bought some little wooden chairs at the craft store for cheap I just had to build them and they worked well.I think this table will lest us a long time. It is great for crafts, tea parties, eating dinner and any other kind of play."
4,"Good quality, a little high for toddlers","Good quality product. The hinges seem safe. Only down side is it is too high for my two year old (he's in 75% for size.) I didn't spend the extra money on the folding chairs, instead purchased folding outdoor chairs from Target. Those chairs are tall enough that my son's feet don't touch the floor. However, the chairs are still too short to get my son to the table in a useful fashion. We are going to cut the table legs shorter, hopefully that will work. Fortunately, they are made of wood."
2,Children's folding table,"When a preschool child leaned heavily on the table, one of its metal supports on the underside gave way after the table had been used only a few times. It definitely should not have been so poorly made. That having been said, the table continues to be used with everyone being very careful about putting much pressure on its surface. The folding feature makes it convenient for the space available."
4,"Good, sturdy table","Chairs sold separately!The table is a quality, easy to fold wooden table- very attractive light colored wood- solid construction. I am confident it will last a long time. My almost 2 year old loves it! We bought the chairs that go with it, which we also love. Biggest problems: 1) My daughter is tall for her age (22 1/2 months) but she still needs to kneel on the chairs in order for her to be most comfortable at the table (sometimes she'll sit & can still work at the table fine, but if she wants to have access to the middle part of the table or beyond she needs to kneel), 2) lip around the edge of the table is great for legos and preventing things from falling off the table easily, BUT makes it much more difficult to clean! Overall, I highly recommend this if you are looking for a versatile, sturdy, wooden, folding table that your child can use for a long time. There aren't many options like this available!"
4,Heavy duty,"It works. I have an Explorer & I pulled an F250 Powerstroke through deep mud & it did not break. Not sure you can ask for more. I did wish it came w/a black finish, but I will just paint mine as it comes as raw steel (unfinished)."
2,Too fast,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and my 7 year old son because they tried yoga and loved it so I thought it would be a great dvd to take on the road so we could do it whenever we wanted. It was way too fast for them. By the time they got the move the instructor was on to the next move. This DVD is intended for 3-6 year olds.the moves Are easy enough but the pace is just too fast!!
4,Great product!,We love the video. The only down side is that there are periods where the transition between poses is too long. Overall my three year old loves it and my one year old likes to try and copy us. This is a big improvement for him as he usually screams when we are trying to do yoga! Maybe it is her tone of voice and the watching all the kids do things. Over all I would recommend to others.
4,fun yoga dvd,"This DVD is bright and fun. It keeps everything short and simple to accommodate short attention spans of little kids. It shows different kids doing the poses in different ways. I think it encourages trying out new things and not worrying about getting it right the first time. A lot of poses I don't recognize from my yoga practice... but they all are good for moving, stretching, and laughing."
2,EH,"I gave it 2 stars because my kids do like the poses... until they get board with it. I wouldn't call this yoga. Its just a lady doing things with kids and moving with kids. But not really yoga poses. When showing the ""poses"" it goes from kid to kid to instructor then to kid from kid again so fast its hard to know exactly what you are expected to do. You know those people who have too many pictures on the wall so its hard to look at any of them. Its like that with every pose. They just switch the camera from kid to kid. There is no real guide lines on how to do any of it... and the kids on the movie don't even do it right and they are there with the instructor. not the best."
4,ok....,"My 7 year old has enjoyed this program. Still, I have difficulty keeping up with it. I have been practicing yoga for over two years, and the lack of transitions/ time for transitions (especially prevelant with the ABC yoga-lots of siting, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing again, kneeling, etc..) seems to wear us both out. I prefer a practice that flows from one postion into the other. This one seems very choppy. After thirty minutes, we both seem to give up a bit. That said, the instructor is very lively and funny."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I actually saw this video as a recommendation when I was purchasing Hooked On Phonics for my son who is 6 and having difficulty with reading and phonics. I was on the fence due to the reviews being so mixed so I decided to check it out from my local library, I'm glad I did because it was not as I expected. I think this video is geared towards smaller children learning the alphabet rather then elementary school children learning phonics or to read. Both my children had fun with the video, but when asked if I should buy it after we need to return it I received a resounding no from both, and as I said I was looking for something to help me more with phonics then just the alphabet."
2,edu-science land and sky telescope,"this toy is hard to operate, hard to see through, I should of bought a more expensive one to get better quality"
3,Good 1st Microscope,"After playing around with the telescope for a long time, we finally got it to work. This really needs adult help to get started. My 8 year old is enjoying it now that we made all the adjustments."
3,mediocre at best,"...you really would think it would perform better. unlike pc management software for nokia's, samsung has highly un-intuitive software that seems very outdated and limited. only real reason i could think of to use this is to transfer ringtones, and its an expensive way to do that...decide for yourselves"
5,AUDIO A DOES IT AGAIN!!!,THIS CD IS A MORE UP BEAT AND HAPPY WORK THAN THEIR PREVIOIUS WORK SOME KIND OF ZOMBIE. THE BOYS HAVE PUT TOGETHER THEIR HEADS AND PULLED OFF A NEW AND EXTREAM SOUND. THIS IS DEFINENTLY ONE OF THE FRESHEST SOUNDS OUT THERE ...AND PRAISING GOD AT THE SAME TIME! TWO THUMBS UP AUDIO A!
4,house plant song rulz,They are just a good band and like someone said its not as good as bloom and the third days release of time Its a good one to have
5,The Best Christian Rock Album,"This time Audio Adrenaline sings retro rock on some of the songs but, on others they sing uplifting songs about Jesus. It's an all around rock album."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"Before u read diz review, go over to dat little ""buy it"" button and click. It'z an awesome band. I hadn't even HEARD of em till I went to da millenium meltdown concert. THEY WERE ROCKIN MAN!!!! Awesome lyrics and music. Hard rock and soft rock all with a great message."
4,Wow!,"This cd is absolutely fun, with no holds barred. I get bored of music easily, but I've listened to the songs numerous times, and they've just gotten better and better. The lead (I don't know who sings) has a voice that lives up to the band name, and has a way of being incredibly appealing whether he's screaming or cooing. It's unique, but definitely very hot.Almost all of the songs are energetic, throbbing and banging cheerfully away,with a kind of explosive strength. Lyrical depth is not their forte, but they convey such an excitement and likability, that it's almost excusable. And they remain focused and meaningful, with a heavy emphasis on spreading the Word.Keep it up, you guys! I can't wait for the next one."
4,First Three Songs Are Best,"Over all a good CD, especially the first three songs, ""Mighty Good Leader"", ""Underdog"", and ""Get Down"". As for rest of the album, it's very eclectic. You have swing, a Sugar Ray flavor song, a classic hymn, and then just a weird but very funny song in ""The Houseplant Song"". All in all, most Audio Adrenaline fans will not be disapointed."
4,Packing the heat,Still one of my all-time favorite christian cd's. My favorite song is the houseplant song at the very end. This is top 50 all time christian album's in my personal opinion.
5,An A+ for AudioA,"This album is probably the best representation of AudioA on a whole. It has parts that resemble the songs of Bloom and also some songs in a more ""Zombie-like"" tone. If you like AudioA this one will quickly become a favorite. The mixture of the different types of songs was probably my favorite aspect of the album. I have all the sides of AudioA that I love right in one album. If you don't have it, get it."
4,almost there,This is a great cd first of all. It starts out with the first 3 songs hitting you hard with some rock. Good Life is a great slow song followed by another hard hitter in Let My Love Open The Door. It cools off a little. DC 10 is a pretty bad song. I don't like Jesus Movement either and This Day is only an average song. Then Audio regains my attention with It's Over. Great song. The good songs are so good that they seem to overshadow the bad and average ones. It is a good buy for an alternative rock/pop fan who loves God.
3,Not too bad but not great,"Audio Adrenaline return in '99 with their latest album, ""Underdog."" One of the most important aspects of a record is how well it flows. Unfortunatly, Audio Adrenaline's latest effort lacks it. The best song on the album is definetly ""Good Life."" The lyrics are some of the best yet from Mark Stuart. ""Good Life"" is about falling into the arms of the Lord when we feel we've lost everything. The album's lyrics make up for alot of the middle-of-the-road guitar hooks. ""Underdog"" is descent but doesn't live up to the band's potential."
3,This One's Okay,"This CD can be fun if you just want to party, but the lyrical depth doesn't go far beyond ""Jesus loves you."" They have a good style but as far as the words... well, it's all been done. I was kind of disappointed when I listened."
3,too laid back and slow,"I love Bloom and Some Kind of Zombie, but I think that they went way overboard with the slow stuff. It has a good message, but I enjoy something with a lot more energy and rock. I think you should buy it if you are looking for something a little bit slower than the usual A.A. ENJOY!"
5,Greatest CD Ever!,"This is one of the best CD's ever! It includes all forms of songs, from rock to pop to contemporary. If you can think of it, it has it! This CD is one CD that you must have!"
5,They just keep getting better and better,"Audio Adrenaline is one of the most recognized alternative Christian bands of today. My favorite songs on the ablum are Get Down, Good Life, and the Houseplant song. These songs are an example of good Christian music with a little bit of fun. Their music just gets better and better through the years."
2,Elementary Book,Let me just say I love Madame Guyon's writings but this book was so elementary that I was turned off. You can literally read this book in one sitting. I have read Madame Guyon's spiritual torrents and Short Method of Prayer. They are a lot better than this. Mainly because I think this book was revised and isn't in her own speech and use of language. It is modernized. I didn't like that. Her own language carries with it her spirit and with her spirit her spiritual life and with her spiritual life her relationship with God. In her other books you can feel the closeness to God. Although whether modernized or not most of what I read in this book can be read online in either or of Spiritual Torrents and Short Method of Prayer. But I bought the book for like less than 5 dollars so how can I complain.
4,Good Fights,I thought all the fights were good on the entire card except for two of the feature matches; Faber vs Barao and Kongo vs Jordan.
1,"ufc 148 ""your life slips away"" would be a good title","UFC 148 ""your life slips away""...if you bother to watch this, the latest in a long string of terrible ppv events chock full of split decisions stall fests and steroided or stoned fighters who's wins are later overturned or DQ'd."
2,Boring fights,"This week in the UFC was a particularly tedious event. None of the fighters was willing to take a chance on a big win. Instead they all played it safe. Very rarely have I fast-forwarded a UFC fight; this time I did this to several. If this is the future of the UFC, then it has no future. Get us some fighters who are still hungry, who are willing to take a risk, and who will provide an exciting fight. And enough with the little tiny guys 135-145 lbs. The best fights have guys who are big enough to do some damage."
2,Terrible book,"This is a weird book. The first section covers introductory stuff everyone should know (with lots of typos like botching math sum notation for the definition of the dot product and stating ""if the dot product is zero, the vectors are parallel""). The next section covers standard shading equations for raytracers. After that it's very basic ""hello world"" shader and dx programming followed by filler for various shader tools out there. Then we get to a few basic examples of vertex shaders and 3 intermediate examples of pixel shaders (toon shading, bump mapping, and fresnel) written all written in assembly!! Then the rest of the book is all filler material for the assembly instructions for the old style vertex/pixel shaders. Oh, in case anyone is wondering, this is pretty much a DX 8.1 only book with examples from 1.0 to 1.4 level shaders."
4,A good shader intro book,"I picked up some of the other book on shaders for DX and it turned out to be a cookie cutter book. There was little explanation on what the shaders were DOING - just source code. I found that frustrating. This book gois into much more explanation of what a shader does and how you program them, so its good for someone leaning how to program shaders. The other book and the new Cg book are more if youre looking for cut and paste. This book did not cover hlsl since hlsl wasnt finished when the book was, but, oddly enough, it does talk about using DX9 and about the DX9 low level language.If you already know shaders or just want source code then look at the other books. This could have had more examples. It did have a big section on the mathematics of light which I found interesting."
4,Excellent book on the subject,"I think the previous reviewers are overly harsh. This is a well written and organized book that gives valuable insights into the history, development and practise of Tai Chi Sword. It answered a lot of questions I had in how the various teachers and styles relate to each other and provided a complete explanation of the relationship between Wu Tang Sword and Tai Chi Sword. The addition of graphics for foot positions, hip positions and sword position are very clever and useful. In addition, directional curves and lines are drawn over the photographs to depict transitions and movements.As I practise and study tai chi sword I have purchased several books on the subject and done extensive internet reading. This is so far my favorite book/resource on the subject. Buy it and decide for yourself!"
2,SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW,"I guess I didn't read the reviews or something. God, SO slow, it seemed like the hero would just stand and stare. And stare and stare. I went out of the room to empty the dryer, and when I came back he was still staring. There is a reason for it, sort of, but they overdid it. In the end, he is back to staring. You better read all you can about it before you rent this."
4,Good movie but...,"This long slow movie managed to keep my interest altho at times it was almost against my will. The lead actor did a great job portraying a difficult character. Yes the character is intelligent and possesses a photographic memory. At times however he is timid and naive and stupid (when you are pointing a loaded gun at an armed man who has tried to kill you you don't need an NRA class to tell you it's a good idea to pull the trigger promptly. And when you've accidentally killed a man in a hunting accident, and you don't plan on telling anyone about it, then it's not wise to leave your fingerprints all around the area etc.) So while the plot, main character and direction are all above average there were times when I wanted to shout, ""Don't just stand there! Do something!"""
5,great!,ive waited so long to see this movie..but once i ordered it the wait was over.i love the speedy delivery!
4,Drama,"Nuevamente Ricardo Darin nos sorprende con su espectacular capacidad histrionica en este drama de enorme peso emocional. La cinta muestra una produccion muy bien trabajada y un guion pensado detenidamente. El unico punto negativo es la falta de eventos precipitantes que te mantengan despierto, en ocasiones cae en el aburrimiento pero la actuación de Darin salva la falta de estos elementos y pone la pelicula en uno de los lugares favoritos de mi estanteria."
3,Careful...,"This item is named ""Phantasmagoria"" and not by the visual vei group of the same name. I recently ordered this and thought I would add this info on here."
2,Not very thorough,"I would strongly recommend the Bates Guide To Physical Examination over this book. This book lacks many procedure details that would help a student learn physical assessment skills. There are some vocabulary terms in the chapters that are undefined, and the illustrations are very limited."
1,"Terrible product, go with an automatic feeder!","Was going on a 10 day trip and needed to find a feeding solution for my tetras in my 16G tank. Decided to try this out because of all the reviews. I did a 25% water change and put this in about an hour before I left. Came back 10 days later only to find this thing had turned completely yellow-brown colored, had somewhat broken apart into large pieces, and my fish were starving to death - the block was untouched. The water was starting to smell and when I retrieved the feeding block out of the tank, it absolutely reeked! All of my poor fish were very pale and barely swimming and it took a long time to coax them into eating the normal fish food. It took about two days for them to recover and act normal. Thankfully none of my fish died but had I been on a even longer trip I suspect all of them would have starved to death.Lesson to be learned here: Don't be cheap, spend the extra $20 and invest in a decent automatic feeder."
2,Disappointing,"This calendar had about 3 decent looking women in it. Being a 16 month calendar, you can imagine my disappointment in the other 13 photos. The graphics look like someone used Wordpad and a cheap inkjet. On a positive note, both Japanese and American holidays are listed in both languages."
1,GIRLS OF OKINAWA NOT FROM OKINAWA,"I PERSONALLY KNOW 8 OF THE GIRLS IN THE CALANDER AND THEY ARE FILIPINA. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THE ORIGINAL TITLE IS MISLEADING. HAVING LIVED HERE FOR OVER 7 YEARS, THERE IS A NOTICABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AVERAGE FILIPINA AND OKINAWAN GIRL. THE CALENDAR SHOULD BE TITLED;""FILIPINA GIRLS IN OKINAWA."""""
2,It wan't what we expected.,"My husband wanted to see what other Okinawan women looked like (besides me), so he bought the calendar. He was so disappointed because there were not many pure Okinawans on the calendar. Yes, there are different ethnic/mixed groups on the island, but there are more pure Okinawans than others. The calendar did not reflect that."
3,"It was a fun experience, but it could've been a lot better","I don't know any of the people that wrote some of the reviews saying that they knew the models....I guess seeing one of them out in public jumps to the conclusion that they know them. I happen to be one of the models and I have no idea as to who these people that wrote the reviews are. As for the whole ""should've been called a Phillipino Calendar,"" whatever. The meaning of the title ""Girls of Okinawa"" was to show people the diverse nationalities in Okinawa. Yes, there are some Phillipino's, but there are also other mixes. I happen to be half Okinawan. I know a couple of the other girls that were in the calendar and they happened to mixed with Chinese, Hawaiian, European, Samoan, Japanese, etc. So as you see...Okinawa is filled with many different nationalities if not mixes."
5,"brilliant documentary essay, splendid performance","Thomas does a superb job taking us on a visual tour of the sights/sounds of Mahler's youth. And the performance of the first symphony shows off all of the conductor's insights splendidly. Compared to (for example) Dudamel's rather literal reading, Thomas illuminates a myriad of rhythmic/melodic details that define the soul of this piece. The string sound may lack the splendor of Vienna, but the woodwinds and horns are the glory here. All the soloists shine as vivid characters in Mahler's ""sonic goulash."" Indeed ""character"" might be the right word to use here. This is a PERFORMANCE in the best sense of the word. Never flashy, rarely even loud, but as Isaac Bashevis Singer once said about Yiddish, it has more VITAMINS!One Kvetsch: who was the schnorer who forgot to put the subtitles on ""Songs of the Wayfarer?"" That's actually the only place on the whole package where they're actually essential!"
1,The worst game!,On the day of release I drove to my local best buy and purchased this game... Hell it's been awhile since I played a good Baseball game... So I opened the wrapper and played all of 7 innings to watch the third basemen punch my player to get him out... The pitcher starts throwing fire which makes it impossible to hit anything... Sorry... maybe I'm getting older now but this just was not fun... I returned it and bought MLB 2004 which honestly is 10x's better.
1,This game is not appropriate for kids,When a player reaches base they punch the baseman. Its terrible.
5,great read for Disney Fans,"Enjoyed reading the book as it had information I did not already know, always a plus for a Disney Fan!"
2,Lightweight coverage of a detailed topic,"It's not that this is a bad book. It's just short. Some of that has to do with the fact that it is little more than pocket book sized. Why they chose to do a book that relies on illustrations and photos in this format, I'm not sure. But coverage and detail are pretty superficial. A few words on a topic you could easily fill a paragraph with. It's also written in the ""everything is great"" Disney style, which I can't complain about since it is a Disney publication. But it'd be nice to know what problems and challenges they had with attractions too.It's pleasant and informative for those who have never read on the topic before, but as a serious study of imagineering it's mostly fluff. Which isn't that much different than its subject matter, the magic kingdom."
3,"Fun topic, but cursory coverage","The topic of the book is fun, and many of the tidbits that the author shares are interesting and surprising, but overall the book is remarkably small and short. The total amount of text included is minimal, and because of the small size of the book most of the pictures and illustrations are reproduced at postage-stamp scale.Because this is a ""field guide"" I guess the small size is intentional, so that one can carry this along on a trip to WDW. But overall I felt that the short content didn't justify the price."
3,"Interesting, but too basic.",This field guide mentions many things that we see in the Magic Kingdom and do not know what it stands for or the meaning. Many of the little details are uncovered. The basics is mentioned but no in depth analysis is given. Good for the beginner.
3,Depressingly lightweight,"While there are a few interesting tidbits about the design of the Magic Kingdom, the writing is far too simplistic for my tastes. Also, while it's nice to have all of the photos of production designs, etc. the format of the book renders them too small to be effective or appreciated. It's not a terrible book, it just isn't the indepth exploration of park design for which I was hoping."
4,Looking back...,"Back when this Cd was first release I bought it, played it and thought... damn! Nick's getting slow and too country for me. Ragin' Eyes is one of my favorites of his,... as are a lot of Nick's work from the 80s but when the 90s hit... he started slowing down. I just compared this album with the cuts I've heard off his new album and I have to say... I'm going to re-buy this one instead of the new one. This CD has so much energy and flair,... something that is really lacking on his new CD. We're all getting older but jeez Nick... at least I still like to rock. How about the next album you drink a lot of 5 hour energy and get Dave Edmonds to produce for old times sake? I'll bet you'd put out your best record since... well,... this one! Please?"
3,Great casters.,"For casters to fit products with thin walls and not flat bottoms, these are the one. You cannot find them anywhere in any store."
3,Description not sufficient,"I am having to return these as they are not the correct size, which isn't listed in the description. Note that the ""U"" bracket 3/4"" wide. I need 5/8""."
4,Rock On!,"This works great for cutting pizza and I am very pleased with my purchase. I had the thought to get this cheaper plastic version to see if I liked it before paying the higher price of a metal one. Well, I like the concept and it works great. I love the fun bright colors . . . I see no reason to get a more expensive metal version . . . this suits me just fine."
1,"Complete junk, melted at first use!","I bought this despite the bad reviews, only to experience exactly what the other reviewers have said. The pizza cutter melted after the very first use! Not only did it melt, but it also did not cut the pizza very well. This item is complete junk. Don't waste your money. Buy a real pizza cutter."
5,"Great for cutting pizza, sandwiches, waffles, pancakes...","We have three of these for several years and love them. Not just for pizza. Forget sawing through sandwiches with a knife. I hold a stack of waffles or pancakes and roll off stripes one way, turn plate and repeat. Quick and neat. Safer around kids, and washes on top dishwasher rack or swipe clean with a sponge. Couldn't be easier. We've not had one melt yet."
4,My go to pizza cutter,"I'm a big fan of the rocker style pizza cutter. It's easy to use and a lot easier to clean compared to the rolling type. Just a quick wipe with a piece of paper towel and I'm done. The quality of the plastic is fine and is holding up well after a few months and a score of pizzas. I'd prefer if it was made of a ceramic, but this will do, especially at a $5 price point."
2,Shipping rip off,"To be honest, you can not beat the price of this item even if it doesn't work. I had a similar cutter of excellent material, (this one is inferior in that respect). HOWEVER for the price of the item, it can not beat it. HOWEVER, the rip off is in the shipping charges. Shipping charges are more than the cost of the item...HELLO... So I thought I would order 6 of them to reduce the costs... but no dice,they multiple the shipping cost 6 times.....So they put the 2 cutters I ordered in an envelope, the postage was $2 and charged me almost $6.... Now thats a rip off. Until this company changes its shipping charge policies, I would never order from them again, and you shouldn't either"
1,Rock and Mash Pizza cutter,I'm not sure what others are trying to cut. I picked this up as an add on to a Christmas order. Glad it was an add on because it got used once. Didn't cut much of anything. I rocked it. I rolled it. And then I got out a knife and cut the pizza.
3,it's ok for a while,I got one of these as a gift years ago. I thought the whole idea was great. in practice not so much. Because it is a half round it is a little dificult to get a straight cut. I almost never do. And it is plastic so the fine plastic edge eventually flatens making it absolutely useless and because it's plastic you can't sharpen it. And god forbid you get it stuck in the utensil drawer. Mine has little chunks out of the edge from being banged around with metal utensils and getting stuck in the drawer. My advice...invest in one of the more expensive retraunt grade rocker blades...that's my next goal.
3,Ok but not great,"I love that it's not sharp so it won't hurt anyone but it doesn't really ""cut it"" for pizza. It works ok for pancakes though. Useful for grilled cheese, etc but not excellent for pizza."
5,Only Pizza Cutter You Need,"We buy these as gifts for everyone, and I would say 1 out of every 5 come back and tell us how uncomfortably sharp the edge they hold is. This is because they're trying to cut the pizza with the wrong side :(. Read your instructions people, it's not rocket science!"
3,Disappointing Set,"I was truly distraught when I brought this disc home and listened to the opening bars of the ""Pathetique"": the tempo was so slow it actually belied the concept of ""tempo."" So slow the music seemed to pull apart at the seams. I'm usually all for a more extreme reading of tempo markings, particularly with Beethoven, but there has to be some restraint, and I think Barenboim missed the mark here. Too bad, because the playing is otherwise excellent, and he hits the nail on the head, it seems to me, with the more energetic allegros. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend a disc of sonatas wherein each of the slow movements serves as an annoying distraction to the superior performances of the fast movements. Try Brendel (3rd cycle), Kempff, or Schnabel for a more even reading of some of the most wonderful music ever composed."
2,The Heroine as Pitiful Monster,"Though she thinks she's writing a romance novel, Cohen has actually produced a grotesquely comic portrait of all that is most loathsome in contemporary American culture. She's self-righteous about all the wrong things: smoking, drinking, drugs and sex. But she has no shame at all about letting her tabloid news producer use her to hound any liberal targets he wants destroyed. In fact, she uses a rumor about Clinton administration officials visiting Moscow prostitutes to get him to finance her childish, silly pilgrimage to Russia to entrap ""a man [she's] never so much as kissed."" When their fanciful romance fails, she returns to a job with Fox Networks, convinced of her own rectitude. At last she has escaped evil Russia, where people drink, smoke and exchange sex for money. She's back home in Trumpland, where true morality reigns."
3,A GREAT SHORT STORY WITH LOCAL COLOR,This is a great quick read. I have been to Moscow and Petersburg and agree with most of her descriptions about life there. Cohen captures a sense of place and immediacy. Her characters are colorful considering how quickly they come and go. She's clever and witty with a dark edge. It is not great literature but very good journalism like a long long short story in the New Yorker. Read it if you are a adventure traveler or wished you could be.
2,good for a laugh,"Cohen's skills as a writer are not bad, but the book is, unintentionally of course, hilarious (if you have lived in Moscow during time Cohen writes of). You have to read the book to see what I mean. By the way if you are wondering what happened to ""Kevin Dillard"" he wrote a review in ""the eXile"" of the book.Gosha"
2,I Wanted something to happen but it didn't.,"This book took me so long to read and I only finished it because I thought maybe it was leading up to something. I guess if you like smoking, drugs, manic depression and submissive women then you will like this book. I think I may be partial to books with some sort of ending."
1,Very Disappointing Degradation in Appearance,"These tumblers started off looking quite nice, but now after less than a year of use (May - Dec 2007), they are starting to look pathetic. The plastic of each tumbler is showing dozens of tiny cracks, or crazing. (A previous set of plastic tumblers that these were purchased to replace took a decade to reach this level of deteriorization.) For what it's worth, I purchased three sets of these tumblers, and they're used only by my wife and myself except when we occasionally have guests, so they certainly have not been overused."
1,Tried once and threw away...,"The colors looked beautiful on my computer screen and looked similar to colors I wear frequently. Upon trying the colors on, I found that they are nothing like any colors I've ever tried. It ended up looking like dirt with glitter...no way could it ever give me a beautiful smokey eye. Most likely it's because my skin is fair/medium with an olive undertone and once I read the literature that arrived with the packaging I realized it was made for asian skin with a yellow undertone. I wish the product description had mentioned that before I wasted my money."
1,I too was very disappointed in this product!,"I've tried tuna helper in the past on occasion and found it to be very tasty but this time, when I thought having a few boxes on hand would be a good idea.....I was very wrong. As stated by all the other reviewers....they did not come with the customary crumbs for the top of the casseroles. And the flavor was so bland and mild as to not have any at all. After trying two flavor packages from two boxes of Tuna Helper in one casserole to no avail, I ended up having to add a can of creamed soup to give the noodles flavor beyond the strong tuna taste. Of course that just added salt injury onto salt injury!! Either Betty Crocker has changed their box contents and their flavor packets or these cases from Amazon are the 'irregulars'. I will not be buying this product again....they are truly awful! You can buy the noodles alone for a whole lot less if you need to add other products just to make it tasty."
2,Disappointed/false advertising,I was greatly disappointed in this product when I received it. My son will ONLY eat the tuna helper with the crunchies on the top and I cant seem to get it in any store. When I found it on here I decided to buy a dozen. I received the tuna helper....and the picture and description on the internet said it was with the topping and the ones I received DID NOT! Im very disappointed.
4,Tuna helper parmesan,"This product is great for people who don't have time or the talent to cook interesting dishes. I add chicken and peas instead of tuna. I still prefer ""creamy pasta"" and add my own fresh parmeson, but amazon doesn't carry it in bulk any more for some reason? This one of those products that you have to buy in bulk to get a reasonable price as it is too expencive per box in the retail setting."
5,wonderfull movie,"This movie is a big MUST for the whole family,It brung tears and joy into my eyes. And it was made to make you stop and think of ones family and to hang onto each other instead pushing eash out of the circle. You all have to see this movie no words can tell you , Only feeling"
4,Please Remember,"I have been studying oriental medicine for the past 5 years intensively. I am currently preparing for a trip to beijing to practice medicine in China as an internship.After reading the previous reviews I picked up a distinct feeling from all of the reviews that is typical.You must remember Chinese Medicine is not a light topic anyone can understand with a few reads. It is truly a differnt mindset and lifestyle.This book is not meant as a book to teach one the precise form and techniques of acupuncture, hence the brief overview of techniques.It will be greatly appreciated once you do learn the techniques however as a guide.If you are interested in learning TCM please keep this in mind. There is a reason all formal medicine schools in China use this book."
4,Chinese med essentials,"This book is an essential for learning Chinese medicine. It covers the principles, diagnosis, acupuncture points and technique. This book is written by Chinese authors and carries the typical language patterns that are functional, but awkward at points. Anyone who has spent time in China and read Chinese writing in English will understand what this means. I also recommend the Foundations of Chinese Medicine by Giovanni Maciocia."
4,Software comes with book,I use this book for school. I've been told by my friends that the software that comes with this book is great but I can't use it on my Mac.
4,Old is still effective,"The 2006 revised edition is a good reference source. Organization is better than most, with complete meridian diagrams and point discussion. It is weak as regards Extra-meridians and their effective points, however the cranial and auricular areas are very well done."
4,High on Low,"This album is very mellow and relaxed. Actually, i fell asleep as i was listening to it. It's good to hear something else sometimes and when i'm too tired for prog metal, i just put this cd on."
4,Searing simplicities,"Another Low album just short of complete minimalistic melodic brilliance, with the group at their earnestly haunted best, stumbles slightly in the second half of low-fi depressive inspiration, despite the epic droning production's final farewell."
5,"A Well-Made, Fun Puzzle","What a fun, colorful, holiday puzzle to put together! Everything mentioned in the song is in this 1,000-piece puzzle! The pieces are easy to handle and are larger than those found in many other puzzles. They're about 1-1/8"" X 1"" each, well-made, and fit together good. The puzzle picture on the front of the box is big by today's standards--approx. 11-3/4"" wide by 9-1/4"". The bigger the puzzle picture, the more helpful it is to assemble the puzzle. As far as difficulty rating, I'd say ""medium."" It's not simple, but it's also not aggravating. It's definitely fun! I look forward to putting this puzzle together every Christmas season."
2,Real deal? Not a chance.,"Shocked to see so many positive reviews for this product. As another reviewer said the ingredients are: horseradish, turmeric, spirulina. Calling this wasabi is like calling food coloring saffron. And you don't have to have lived in Japan to see that this stuff ain't wasabi. The instructions say ""mix powder to form a paste"". Well, it does have heat. But what you get is this ugly, pale and chalky paste. You need to use a LOT of powder and very little water to get it to the right consistency. Next time, I'll try getting my hands on REAL wasabi root from the asian grocery store."
3,Oaky but not great,A little thin but it still beats just having the regular electric burner showing. Had there been more variety I probably would have spent more to get a more solid set. But they are okay.
3,Not as interesing as Gaiman's novels,"I am a big fan of Gaiman's novels and have never read the Sandman series. This is the first graphic novel I have ever read and was only moderately intrigued. ""The Price"" was an interesting short story and the graphics helped, however, ""The Daughter of Owls"" was less impressive and I didn't care for he illustrations. This made me long for another Gaiman novel, the shortness of this was too disappointing. Not a bad thing to pickup at the library but if you are more of a novel person, don't buy it."
5,The only oil filter I will use.,"My father taught me that if you change the oil, the car will last forever. So in all of my performance and SUV vehicles I buy synthetic oil and the best filters. All studies prove that with oil filters, you get exactly what you pay for so don't go cheap. I have used Amsoil, Fram and others but K&N has that integral nut on the housing. Over the years I have had to grip, strip and stab filters to get them loose. The later filter wrenches seem to have wild tolerance differences so they just spin on the end of the filter. Not with the K&N. Get your socket wrench on the filter and its going on or coming off. I have one vehicle now where the filter is in the front of the engine. There is an access door and the filter resides in a channel. Without the K&N, oil changing would be a very challenging event."
5,this is the filter you want!,"this is one of the best highest quality oil filters around! AND, its made in the USA!"
5,An incredible view of Pelleas et Melisande,"This is an incredibly dark, rich and moving interpretation of the Debussy masterpiece Pelleas et Melisande. Karajan sees the opera through a Wagner filter with the orchestra playing a powerful role in the drama. Von Stade, Stilwell and especially Van Dam are wonderful in their roles as Melisande, Pelleas and Golaud respectively. This might not be a really French way to approach this most French of creations, but this recording is definitely one of the finest Pelleas and Melisande recordings around."
1,Karajan Attempts Debussy,"Read A Music Fan's review above.I'm very syrprised EMI would even consider allowing Kraajan to record ANY Debussy, even more so the very difficult score of Pelleas.Of course all the glowing reviewers have not heard Desormiere's 1942 nor Ingelbrecht's masterpiece recordings.Of course not.Yet they rate Karajan a hit.One star for attempt."
2,"Nice slippers, but run small and narrow","Bought these slippers for my mom who has a wide foot. The sizing indicated that these are wide but they were small and narrow when received. Had to return them, so out the cost of shipping. Nice slippers, but be careful with sizing."
1,"Pretty, but very uncomfortable","I really wanted slippers with an animal print, and I didn't mind that these slippers were a little expensive, but they were so stiff and unforgiving, and I guess I prefer softer slippers."
5,Fostoria American Line 2056,"Book in excellent condition, very good price as I bargain shopped. The book is a must for the Fostoria American collector. Received quickly.Purchased as a gift for a collector."
5,Fostoria,"The book is excellant reference for this style glassware. The pictures are clear and easy to compare the glassware object .The only problem I found is ""I already have the book!"" So always check your library before buying."
2,Basics of Marketing,"This book is mostly the basics of sales and marketing. The basic ideas presented are the same as you would expect to find in an introduction to marketing textbook. If you have little knowledge of the concepts of sales and marketing and would like to learn how these concepts relate to your DJ business, then buy this book-it will be very useful to you. If you already have a strong understanding of the basics of sales and marketing principles, then this book won't offer you much."
5,This Book Helped My Business,"I've been DJing for years but knew I was lacking in marketing knowledge and sales skills. I read this book, immediately put some of the ideas into practice, and saw results right away! The DJ Sales & Marketing Handbook and The Mobile DJ Handbook are my two most important reference manuals for the sucess of my mobile entertainment business."
5,One of the Finest cellist in the world.,"Her emotion influenced me once the bow touchs the string. She is not playing the cello by hands, but her heart. I bet Atonie Dvorak would be touched if he's still living and would appreicate this God's gift to perform his fine art. The solo in CD2 strongly reveal Jacqueline's power in love and struggle the love with her brother-in-law. It's recommended to play the CD2 at night and early morning."
5,Excellent,"I bought this cd only for The Marketts version of ""The Batman Theme.""This version of the song peaked on Billboard's Hot 100 on February 26, 1966 at number 17. The original TV version by Neal Hefti (his original is unavailable on cd however, he made a remake that is available) reached number 35 on March 5, 1966."
5,The Best mp3 Player.,"I bought the M3 in 2004, and it has performed beautifuly. The optional screen feature is awsome because you can, for example, while riding a bike, change the song without taking the player out of your pocket. The Jetshell used for putting music on the player is extremely easy to use. The sound quality is much better than an ipod or any other competitor. Finally, there is also FM/AM radio, voice recording, and direct line-in/line-out recording. A downside to this player, if any, would be the adapter thing you connect to the bottom of the player for USB/charging/line in/line out; because if you loose it, you're screwed. But, there is a way to avoid that, you can buy a cradle, and use it instead. So, overall if you are thinking about getting this player, and don't want the hastle of worring about your screen scratching up, buy the Cowon iaudio m3."
3,AIR FILTER NISSAN D21 V6 MODEL,"Fits a V6 Nissan D21. Too bad I have a 4 cylinder, and the site didn't specify which type i was ordering. CATALOG YOUR STUFF BETTER, AMAZON! Fram makes good stuff tho, I'm sure it's all right."
1,Hair Color,"This product was old an had oxidized. Very dissapointed but used it anyway , Have been using it for about 25 years."
5,"Bloody fantastic ,simply out of this world","When i listened to it for the first time i could not help going with it's swing.It reminds me of a certain Paul Oakenfold mixers but that is for well tuned ears to pick out.Anyways the ""clip"" pretty fantastic also ,with it's computer generated graphics.If you haven't got it,you are sadly out of tune. D.M.R"
4,Blue is a good song,"""Blue"" is an excellent song. I like how it has a good beat and sounds sorta like a good dance song. I definenitly recommend this album to any one that enjoys a good beat and loves pop.Travis"
2,Am I the only one?!,I'm sorry this song is just horrid. The singing gets on my nerves so quick and the synths are weak. No idea why this song is so huge. Maybe this song is marketed around the world like MTV markets their lame songs. I'll give it 2 stars cause it does have a beat :)
5,Clay's Review,"I think it is pretty neat how Eiffel 65 copyed off of Cher and used the digital voice like Cher does in ""Love after Love"". Overall, I think this is a superb CD. REALLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,One of the biggest hits in Europe... almost 5 months ago :),"When i first time saw a video Eiffel 65 - Blue (da ba dee) on VIVA (german music tv station) i knew that it was gonna be a BIG hit right away. I wasn't mistaken. BUY IT! It's worth the money, even though 5 months have passed since it came out. Bliss Corporation hit big! European Dance Rules!"
4,Great Job E65,E65 did apretty good job on Blue(da ba dee). I for one especially liked the music video. I liked the blue aliens. Awsome job!
2,Sigh,"Gosh, this is dumb. The song doesn't really say anything. Its programmed beat is numbing. Its catchy melody is loused up by the cheesy production effects. It's fun once or twice, but after that becomes as obnoxious as disco. And if I hear that dopey narrator one more time..."
3,This song gets stuck in your head...,"I don't like the song a lot, but it gets stuck in your head if u hear it...it's kinda sad, too."
1,"Oh, for the love of....","The idea of so many people enjoying this track is just wrong , wrong, WRONG! This has got to be the most vile, detrimental, disadvantageous, and inauspicious piece of garbage besides Celine Dion. The ""lyrics"" (if you want to call it that) are just excrementitious and stercoraceous. It's as if they got this song from a kareoki bar..no rhythm whatsoever. I'm giving it one star because there isn't a negative rating system. While I'm sure the average clubber will enjoy this empyreumatic and inefficacious blunder, be wary that this is just another ""catchy tune"" which just seems to successfully nauseate myself. This is the type of song where it's either you love it or hate it. I don't love it. So remember, JUST SAY NO"
1,Blue (Da Ba Dee),"To make a long review short, this is by far the worst song on the millenium. I am ashamed to have even heard it on the radio. If there is only one song in the history of music that shouldn't have been even thought of to put on the radio, it is definitely this. The lyrics are by far the worst of all. The singer's voice is completely annoying. The title of the band is really dumb. I wish that everyone would burn this CD. If just this one song is that stupid, I can't even begin to wonder what other kinds of completely horrible songs are on the album. TERRIBLE!"
4,Tripping!,"Okay, I've only heard it 3 times, but Blue is pretty cool. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can see it getting old kinda fast, like most techno-dance-whatever songs. But otherwise, it rules. And the video kicks arse, too."
5,Kicin the place up a notch!,this song is so cool! it has all the beat and whe n you hear it it's like everything you see is BLUE! Blue's has always been my favorite color! and probably always will
5,This song is the best thing since the 80's!,"This song just makes me so energized whenever i hear it, meaning so many different things to different people....personally, i absolutely love it."
5,Great CD,"Many people think this song is just too crazy for them to handle, but thats what is so great about it. Its a different type of music, something new. Its great."
2,Blue - Eiffel 65 CD,"Great song. I didn't realize that the entire CD was variations of just the one song. The group is fine, just had hoped for more."
5,I'm Blue Da ba dee da ba di,"This is one of my favorite songs from 1998 - 2007, but I firts heard this song and saw the video in 2000 on the disney channel. In the CD Single the ice pop mix sounds a little the same, but much longer. the Blue paris remix sounds like a funky type of beat. I still remember when i listen to the radio stations back in 2000. I never heard it on the radio until in 2001 only one time on the radio station. I still here the song at my school on feild day. I even sang this song at the talent show in 2004 when i was in fourth grade.But the funny thing is when ever anyone heres the song, they have it stuck in there heads for a couble of days sometimes."
3,This CD ROCKS,This CD is really good if you do by the entire CD it's called Eiffel 65 Europop there are some really good songs on it and some that are not so good but overall it is an exceptional cd.
5,Blue,YOU SHOULD BUY THE CD BLUE BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD FOR THOSE THAT HATE LISTEN TO IT AND YOU WILL LIKE IT VERY VERY MUCH THIS CD IS MY FAVORITE CD .I HOPE YOU BUY THE CD BLUE.
2,Dumb da dum dumb,"""Blue"" is an incomparably dumb pop record. It's a shame, really, because it is based upon a pretty catchy hook. But no, it drops the ball. First of all, what is up with that mafia joe shmoe narrator with his idiotic shtick? No wonder ""he ain't go no one to listen!"" Then we get to the chorus. What the devil is he saying? I can't tell, due to the heavy use of the vocoder, a disturbing trend in recent pop that seems to think obscuring vocals with an ancient cheesy technology is a good idea. Then we come to the.. er... verse, which consists of a guy sounding like he thinks he's cool in 1983 talking, not singing, about basically nothing. Horrid. Dance to it if youmust, but it's only valuable as a novelty record. When heard more than twice it gets on your nerves like nobody's business."
1,eugh!,I just want to say that i think this is the most irritating and stupid song i have ever heard.The lyrics are dumb and the singing (if you can call it that) is horrible. This is really commecialised dance music.Don't waste your money by buying this!
1,I dislike this cd greatly,This cd is a disgrace to techno and dance music around the world. The lyrics are idiotic. The composer seems to believe that he has enough hold to make the words a part of the song but in the end it just comes off as pure idiocy. Aside from the no-talent music and the unbelievably stupid lyrics though it really wasn't that bad.
1,UUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,THIS SONG IS BY FAR THE STUPIDEST OF THE YEAR! GET A GOOD CD LIKE SANTANA! NOT THIS!AND BY THE WAY; WHERE IS THE ZERO STARS? ? CAUSE IF THERE WAS A ZERO STARS ON THERE THAT IS DEFINATELY WHAT THIS WOULD HAVE GOTTEN!
1,"Pointless, Boring","When I first heard ""Blue"" I decided that the tune was catchy and that it was an all-about reasonable song. Then, after I had heard it about 10 billion times, I began to listen to it more carefully, and realized that this song had no ""plot"" so to speak. There is no clear reason why the little man is so blue, and how everything else incorporates with his blue-ness. To cut a long story short, this song starts out ok, then as we get into it, it becomes more repetitive and pointless."
1,I meant 0 stars,"Arrgh! I hate the Blue song so much. It's only on the radio every 15 minutes. Why would you buy this single? The first time I heard this song, I hated it and now it's become even more irritating."
3,A Unusual but Cool Song,"This song is on thestrange side of music, but hey, what can I say? I like it- especially the little Blue people!"
3,Now vs. Later,"I have to admit, I like this song ""Blue""...for now that is. But like all catchy, simple, whatever-you-want-to-call-it songs - it is played every second the radio is on (and I don't even really listen to pop-radio that often!). Soon, people will get sick of it and retaliate - it's going to happen - mark my words! Basically what I'm saying is this: if you plan to buy this cd, SHUT OFF YOUR RADIO NOW! and then don't be surprised if in a few months/years you feel the need to walk into a cd exchange center and shamefully slide ""Eiffel 65"" to a man behind a counter in exchange for 7 bucks - remember Ace of Base? Yeah, I thought so..."
5,perfect christian fiction,This books has all the elements. Its fast paced. It combineshistory and religion. Any history buff will love its way of revisiting historical places in modern terms. All lovers of God'sWord will enjoy how the main character handles himself in unusualpredicaments. Excellent dialogue.
3,Content,Superb flow of writing..! recomended by most Spoken English teachers for their Students for drama. It's a must to boos up your acting skills.
1,"Organic beans wrapped in ""Bisphenol A"" lined cans","I went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans.BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous.Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA.To be fair, it has to be said, that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPA[...]They might be slightly more expensive, but you save your body a substance that acts in your system like Oestrogen."
5,Perfect for my use.,I use these to make padded 'feet' on coasters. Works like a charm. Great quality for the price. No complaints.
2,I just didn't get it,"After reading three other books of this author which I liked a lot, this was a disappointment. I must admit that I just didn't get the plot. For example what did Molly do to the policeman which made him confess the murder? And who or what was the always sleeping old women at Joyces' appartment. And so on... After 500 pages I'm still as unknown as after the first 100 pages. I give it two stars because it's nicely written. Some explicit and emotional scenes I liked a lot."
1,"If you must have this, get Reflections instead.","Two CD's were released from German television programs showing Roxy Music in 1972 and 1974. This CD, contains the 1974 stuff and is not that interesting. Valentine, which contains the 1972 music is much more interesting.There is a new release, called Reflections which contains both Vintage and Valentine.The sound quality of both is bad. The only interesting thing is the video, showing these guys in their youth, when they didn't know any better."
4,Feel like i'm doing good to the earth but its a little thin.,"The toilet paper is white. There are lots of sheets (1000 to be exact but I have not counted). If you buy this bulk pack on subscribe and save the price per roll is significantly cheaper than what I have found in the super markets. My only complaint is that it is a little thin and breaks apart easily. It is also a little rough, I say that in comparison to the real soft brands. If you like luxury in your soft bouncy toilet paper this is not for you. If you like a roll with plenty of sheets, where you jump into that toilet, do your thing and move on with your day, this is for you.There is a 500 sheet version which i find is stronger, but not much more luxurious."
3,One ply doesn't really cut it!,"I usually love seventh generation products but this one is way to thin. I have to use about 15 sheets every time, which kind of defeats the purpose of single ply. Go with the seventh generation two ply double roll, its much better."
3,Does the job.... but.......,"It does the job, and makes me feel that I am doing my part for the planet, but the paper is SO THIN, that much more is needed than with another brand, and I take a lot of ribbing from my more conventional friends."
2,"Well, it isn't sand paper...","I'm all for saving the environment and I try to do my part, but this particular bathroom tissue is less than friendly to the bottom. They are effective, but not so comfortable. I know that there is a grocery store chain that makes much more comfortable recycled paper."
3,1 Ply - How much TP are you really saving?,"1 ply is so thin, I find myself using more of the stuff to avoid mishaps. When I buy 7th Generation TP at the store, it's usually 2 ply, and I think that's a better product. Wouldn't buy this 1 ply stuff again."
2,Bought the single-ply by mistake,"We use quite a few Seventh Generation products and I had previously purchased a case of the 2-ply bathroom tissue. When I reordered, I got the 1-ply by mistake.We're using it, but I will be glad to see it go so I can get the 2-ply again. I would gladly sacrifice a little comfort for what is hopefully a more environmentally friendly product. This version, however, just isn't usable.If you are considering this, I strongly recommend the 2-ply instead."
1,No!!!,"I bought this item, trying to save my planet....So I thought it was a little rough, chafed a bit...then my finger poked through. Don't...I repeat, DON'T use this toilet paper if you have issues with your fingers going through..because it's very flimsy. I believe in recycling, and cutting down on environmental loss, I guess im just selfish about my toilet paper needs. I wont be purchasing this product again."
1,$50 down the drain,BEWARE. I ordered three practice sabre blades from Physical Chess this summer and after months of waiting I have still never received them. Any attempt to contact Physical Chess is useless for I believe their voicemail system to have fallen into disuse and my emails were ignored. This company does not deserve any of your business! Do not trust them to deliver on what they promise.
1,Just beware of Bell's Customer Service!,There is none. If you ever need to get info or a replacement part...good luck.
1,Mounting?,"It didn't even pass the initial setup.... there are too many flexible points, all mounted with screws that are in the very limit of size and then, in the end... the system do not fit in the bike, besides looking very unstable. I regret not having seen the reviews before I spent part of my weekend on it, and now I have to return it."
1,"Bad, cheaply made product with useless support","My wife just got this car seat and I am now going to the hardware store to buy adaptors so that the seat will fit at least one of our Schwinn bikes. The car seat ended up with the car seat handle hanging over the bike seat. For about 5 cents more of metal it would have fit. Also, the bolts were of poor quality and stripped when installing so I am buying new bolts already. I will spend more on 'rigging' this car seat so it works than what it would have cost to buy a nice one from a real bike store and not a cheap mass retail importer. I think it will be safe once I modify it all. What a joke of a product though."
4,I figured out how to mount it on my hybrid/wider frame!,"I read all the reviews and figured the price was good and we were specifically looking for a rear mounted seat for my bike, so we gave this one a try. After an inital VERY frustratiing try of getting it on my bike, we figured out that if you flipped the lower clamp pieces onto the outside of the mounting bar, it will fit some wider bikes, like mine. We tested it out and it's safe and works great. My daughter is 2 and loves riding in it! The only problem is that it puts her to sleep and then she can't really lean back b/c of her helmet, so her head flops around a little. Nothing a small pillow wedged in the safety bar won't fix! So far...a fun little seat at a good price!"
1,Spend some extra money for peace of mind.,"There's nothing I liked about this seat.The way the rack attaches to the bicycle is clumsy.The seat attaches to the rack with three narrow bolts, and is not as easy to attach or remove as the description would have you believe.The seat is made of very flimsy plastic.I rode with my daughter in this seat one time and worried the whole ride. I ordered the Topeak Babysitter afterwards. When it arrived, I removed the Bell seat and threw it in the trash. I wasn't even comfortable giving it to someone else.The Topeak Babysitter rack attaches sensibly to the frame, the seat attaches securely to the rack, and the seat is rigid - not flimsy at all.Do your kid a favor and spend a little money up front. You'll be glad you did."
4,Pretty Good for the Money,"Installed the product last week and have taken bike rides withs my 17 month old (23 lbs) and 3 year old (31 lbs). Both liked it. Neither complained that it was uncomfortable. The seat does attach and detach very quickly. While I will agree that the higher parts of plastic are flimsy, I suspect it helps with the shock absorption. Have not read a review claiming the seat broke or snapped as some of the negative reviews seem to be concerned with."
3,Decent for the price,"This seat is good for the price, but it is pretty flimsy. I haven't had any real problems with it, but when attached, you can grab the top and flex it back and forth several inches. I don't think it is unsafe, but just makes for a bit more sway for baby. The ability to remove the seat from the frame is nice, although the mechanism for doing this feels kinda cheap and awkward."
1,Terrible Product,My husband and I purchased this 2 days ago and are returning it today. It took him 2 hours to install and the plastic is cheap and flimsy. We were afraid to put our son in it but decided to go for a very short ride down the street. After 5 minutes in the seat he was in a reclining position almost touching the back tire. The seat itself was comfortable for him but it bends and moves around too easily. I would not recommend buying this product...spend some more $ for a more safe and reliable product.
4,Good and robust products,"Pro: good desgin, robustCon: worst manual and package.I purchased this Bell Cocoon from Walmart. It actually took me a while to figure out the manual, then 2.5 hr to install everything. My plan is to install it on my wife's 24"" mountain bike, however, it does not fix, so I installed it on my 26"" mountain bike instead (I purchased a Copilot for that 24"" bike.)Overall, I do like Bell's design, it is robust since it provide several points to secured to the bike, and once it is secured, it just don't move. For my other Copilot seat, there are only 4 points to secured with bike, plus one belt to fasten to seat pole. It seems not a good design to me. However, Copilot does provide me an advantage that I can remove car seat easily which Bell does not.I suggest Bell can write its manual more friendly. Or, at least, assembly the rack in factory, then customers just secure it to bike. That is why I just give it 4start, not 5."
3,Good but not as good as copilot,"I have the copilot on my other bike and got this one for my other son. This does not compare at all to the copilot. The copilot is much more expensive though. Anyway, the rack that comes with this is a cheap plastic rack. It is really hard to get to fit to my bike and it interferes with changing of gears b/c it gets in the way of the wire.this is good for the money but if i had it to do it again, i would get another copilot.UPDATE: I have had it for some time now and want to update that it is really wobbly on the back of the bike. If you are looking at this, I would go for a better seat."
2,"Nice seat, poor attactment for easy removal","This bike seat, for its price was nice enough and easy enough to install. But within three times of removing it so my husband could ride solo, which is done by three cheap screws, the screws started to strip. We are sending it back."
3,Good but not so easy for all ages,The description of this item said even the youngest infant could use this product. It is too bifg for my 5 month old who is not quite holding his head up all the time.
3,It's ok for a cheap seat.,I recently purchased this on a trip and installed it on my father-in-laws bike. It seemed to work ok although the sholder straps fell off her sholders since there is no sternum strap.The problem is that it doesn't fit on my husband or my bike. I have a Raleigh m-80 and he has an older giant(an extrememly large framed bike because he is tall). So we are taking it back.
3,Doesn't fit all bikes,"This is rather easy to put together and looks well made, however it only fits certain bikes and unfortunately not our Verticals. The lower attachments are rather narow and had a hard time fitting the flattened tube shape of the bike as well. Maybe with longer screws it would have been fine??"
4,Great bike seat!,"We purchased this bike seat for our 18-month-old daughter. It was easy to install and is very durable. The cushions are not really thick, but they are better than nothing. We've really enjoyed this bike seat and would highly recommend it."
3,Decent child carrier,"I received this and set about the task of unpacking the carrier and installing it last night. Forst, my box had no packing materials...just the carrier and parts, so the box was just about destroyed. Surprisingly, there were no missing parts or damaged parts.I began installing this on my wife's cruiser-style bike. This thing barely fit. I'm not sure if this bike seat was meant for taller riders who were planning on having their seat raised many inches above the bottom position, but it just didn't quite fit right.I finally got everything installed, but it just didn't come together as smoothly as I expect a propduct from Bell to.Great price, great name, not worried about safety concerns, but a better-designed bracket system would do this product a world of good."
1,Bell Cocoon - spend a little more on something else.,"I was attracted to this item due in large part to the reputation of the brand. The price, while secondary in my decision to buy, made this a bargain.I now wish I had spent a little more for something that I'd feel safe transporting my child in. I installed the seat per included instructions and found it to be really unsteady. Just to be safe, I took the seat to a bike store and had it reinstalled professionally. Still did not provide the stability I was hoping for and after 1 ride I retired the seat out of a real concern for safety. I would have sent it back, but had already thrown out the box."
5,BELL COCOON CHILD CARRIER,"INSTALLATION TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED BUT ONLY BECAUSE THIS CARRIER IS REALLY ATTACHED TO THE BIKE WELL AND WON'T FALL OFF IF INSTALLED RIGHT! 18 MONTH OLD REALLY LIKED HIS FIRST RIDE. BE WATCHFUL THOUGH, WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP AND HIS HEAD WENT DOWN, THE HELMET STRAP SEEMED TO BE TIGHT ON HIS THROAT-COULD BE CHOKING HIM. CARRIER IS A GOOD VALUE- WE ARE HAPPY"
1,do not purchase,Purchase from WalMart and the seat fell off while my grand daughter and I were ridding. DO NOT purchase
4,Good seat,"After researching the right seat for the right price we ended up buying this Cocoon seat. Online it said ""new"" and after receiving it pieces were used and there was hardware missing which delayed our rides (a bit bummed about that) but once we got the bike up and running it worked really well. It is a bit complicated getting it on the bike and isn't a quick on/off if you were to move it to another bike (another bummer).My 1 year old son who's about 31"" tall and 25 lbs fits great in in and my feet don't hit the foot rests at all. I have a women's 26"" bike and I'm 5'6""...so overall it's a good seat."
1,Very flimsy,"I bought this seat and attached it to a new (cheap but workable) bike. After only one ride around the block, I was amazed this seat passes any safety standards. Although attached securely to the bike, the plastic ""coccoon"" itself feels very flimsy and allowed alot of side-to-side sway while I was riding and daughter was looking around; I was constantly worried the whole thing was about the crack and break off. I was also really worried about her spine as every small bump resulted in major jolting for her (granted, Bell certainly doesn't claim to have any shock absorbers on this seat). I've returned the whole thing and have decided I'm willing to pay MUCH more for a seat that is sturdy, safe and comfy, likely will get the Topeak babysitter."
4,"Solid body, cumbersome mounting","The chair comes with a heavy and cumbersome mount that must replace your back rack. Well, turns out, it does not fit a fairly regular mountain bike with hydroform alluminum alloy tubes - the brackets that are supposed to clamp around rear triangle legs are too small and narrow. They can only fit a steel or street bike, which are not as common today. Wish they'd come up with a seat that can mount onto a regular rear rack."
3,Serves its purpose,"My bike is up off the floor in my teeny tiny apt. Shipment came w/ missing screws. However, I do not know how the last reviewer found the same type of screws at a hardware store. It stands and doesn't fall apart and I'm not shaking it so I hopefully no one gets hurt. I was adjusting the bars often initially to get it comfortable for me to mount things -- I'm short -- and the rubber started to rip apart. Quailty - 2 stars. It does what it says it should do - 4 stars."
2,Not for heavy bicycles,"Tried it on my Dutch bicycles, nearly toppled the whole thing over. Really useless for my case. Might be great for lightweight bicycles but don't use for steel 50lb ones."
2,"Good packing, threading is shameful","This product looks good, is shipped well, but the threading in the tubes is a shameful joke. Only half of the tube's internal threading actually work, the rest just strip out. An embarrassing and cheap place to skimp in an otherwise decent product. You will need to hold this in place with duct tape."
4,works well,Use this bike stand to hold two bikes inside my small condo. Looks decent and works great to reduce the amount of room the two bikes take up in my bedroom.
3,"Sturdy, but...","This unit is compact, very sturdy and very easy to assemble (less than 10 min). Even with a full-sized bike on the upper level, I did not feel a need to fasten the unit to my garage wall.However, the unit is obviously meant for two men's bikes, or possibly two women's, but not a mix of both. A man's bike with a horizontal crossbar hangs very easily. But when a women's bike with an angled crossbar is added the unit becomes unstable because of the uneven weight. We solved this by not hanging my bike (woman's) and instead just propping it up on the lower level. This works for us, but might cause a problem if space is an issue on the lower level, since the bottom bike then juts out a little further than it would if it were hung. Since space was my issue in the first place, I can only assign a mediocre rating. If you have two matching bikes, you will most likely rate this rack higher."
4,"Missing screws, but works well","My stand showed up with only one of the half dozen hex-screws it needed. I was able to take that screw to a local h/w store and get a half dozen phillips head screws of the same width and depth. First, though, I'd tried to call the company using the provided phone number and kept getting redirected to voicemail boxes which were full, such that I couldn't leave a message.The stand was very easy to assemble. Took just a few minutes and a screwdriver.We don't ride our bikes much, so I don't have a lot of experience taking them on or off, but they are quite stable once up."
5,Sleek and functional,"Great product. Looks sleek, and holds the bikes well. Has an optional wall mount, though I never used it."
3,Average after working through the kinks,"This was an average bike rack but it was suprisingly stable and didn't take up too much space in our small condo.Two main problems that we had with the stand were: 1. The first one that we received was missing some of the parts for putting it together. We exchanged it for a new one which was very easy to put together. 2. After a few weeks of use, the rubber on the bike holders started peeling off of two of the holders, leaving minor scratches on the bikes."
2,I was afraid of it falling.,"When I got this it was a lot bigger than I was imagining, it also takes up a lot more space than I was expecting.I was also always worried about the whole rack falling over, which it occasionally did while I was taking my bikes on and off.I returned it."
4,"Works just fine, but can be a little scary","I'm surprised how stable this rack has been so far. It can wobble a slight bit from time to time, but it always retains its position against my wall. I have scared my dog at least once with the bike sliding on the hooks. I'm sure there's a better placement I can maintain of my bicycle than I'm providing it on the hooks, but it's hard to balance a bicycle with a heavy back and a frame that slants up to the front handlebars (like I expect most bicycles to be).I currently have the bicycle raised over the console table in my apartment. It's plenty tall for this purpose with plenty of room underneath for furnishings on the console table."
5,Excellent Gravity Stand!,"Very pleased w/ this purchase. Gravity stand is very stable, no drilling holes into your wall and adjustable for any two bikes. Best of all, it looks great; good enough to display in any room. We purchased two stands for four bikes for our small hallway, now it's bike showroom! It's very affordable, great value for your money, can't ask for more than that. Highly recommend!!"
5,"Sturdy, pretty, functional.","This is a great stand. I'm only storing one 20lb road bike on it on the top of the rack. It's super stable. I've tried to get it to fall over (kids dont try that at home) it just bounces back into place. There's a little strap to anchor to the wall...not really ""needed"" but living in California, I used it just in case theres a little shake and rumble. It comes with 2 sets of hooks for bikes and two small utility hooks (for helmets and things). Took me 3 minutes to assemble and have my bike hanging. Excellent!"
4,Great stand! Poor strap to screw to the wall though,"Overall I really like this stand. It holds my mountain bike and road bike in a small apartment, and makes plenty of room! It seems very sturdy and is very easy to get the bikes on and off. The only complaint I have about this product, is that the strap that holds the shelf to the wall is pretty week, and has already started to rip. Living in earthquake country, I made my own pretty quick with plastic rip ties and some screws."
3,Quality control has dropped,"We bought one of these a couple of years ago, and liked it so much that we decided to buy another. The design has now changed substantially from that in the pictures (I've attached a photo), for example it is no longer round at the top. The tubes are beefier and more solid, but on ours the bend at the top is not symmetric, I have had to leave a gap of around 1/2"" in a join on one side to keep the rack from tilting significantly to one side. The rack is also a couple of inches taller than the old one, and does not currently fit where we want to put it (next to the old one), and so I will be cutting it down before final installation. If I didn't own a miter saw I'd be sending this back."
4,Problem solved,"Product works well, just as described by Amazon and other reviewers.It has helped me with more space in my storage area.Assembly was extremely easy. I had it together in a manner of 10 to 15 mins."
5,great item,This is perfect for the garage to hold my mountain bike and weed eater. Glad I purchased it.
5,THIS IS ADORABLE,"Trotter is my daughter's favorite toy. She is 4 months old now and has had it since she was 2 months. It has been a lifesaver. She loves Trotter's hooves, and sticks them in her mouth. But what she enjoys the most is his crinkly tail. I love Trotter because he is washable, he comes clean great, and because my daughter's face lights up and she gets the biggest smile when she sees him. We take him EVERYWHERE. If you need anouther toy suggestion Celeste is wonderful too!!"
5,"Lamazebrightfriends, trotter the pony",Very colorful. Multisensory explorationDifferent parts allow for working small motor skills for the baby;My 6 month grand baby loves it
5,Great!!!,"I bought these for a gift for my husband who brews his own beer. He loves them!!! Thick glass, very nice I would totally recommend these to everyone! I bought another 2 sets for friends birthdays, all still love them and not one has broke! Tried to get some more but they aren't available anymore..."
4,Great mop,Does exactly what I was hoping it would do. Easy clean up as well. I did buy 2 extra mop head replacements as I didnt know how long the original would last as I use it pretty frequently on the weekends. After about a month the mop is still almost new so I dont anticipate needing to use one of the replacements anytime soon. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an item like this.
2,Not a good tool for Spinning Instructors,I purchased this book to get ideas for profiles when teaching my Spinning class at the gym. The profiles shown were very repetitive and did not offer much that I could use for my class. If you were buying it for more of a home workout then it's probably a good deal if you can get a used copy. I am going to see if anybody in my class wants it and just give it to them as I won't be using it.
3,simple,"The book could be more elaborated. It is no good for elaborating a major plan, neither it considers your weekly training load."
4,Discs mislabeled,"This isn't so much a review as a comment: The two discs I've seen are mislabeled. The Cagney disc has the John Wayne label on it, and vice-versa. Doesn't speak well for Madacy's quality control processes."
3,Pretty book,"This is a well presented book, but for a much older child; it is an adult book, actually. The illustrations are lovely."
5,I love this tuna!,"I don't understand the only other review. I am not a tuna lover. Never have been. Somebody suggested I try tuna in oil instead of albacore in water. This is delicious. I like the fact that it is not in a lot of oil. I can eat this right out of the can but I have made tuna salad (great with olive oil mayo), tuna casserole and it tastes great. I also like the small pop up cans which are great in the rv or for picnics or just one or two servings. I am sold on yellow fin (which is the kind of tuna this is)."
5,Perfect for me,"I have an allergy to soybean oil and this tuna is perfect for me as most tuna is packed in soybean oil and this tuna is packed in olive oil. It is very good, with excellent flavor and texture. I have used it for sandwiches and salads and it is great."
5,The Little Balloonist,"The Little Balloonist by Linda Donn is a wonderful story of love, loss and redemption told through the life of Sophie Blanchard, one of the first women balloonists.Sophie is a determined young woman who makes the most of adversity and forges for herself a remarkable life. Ms. Donn is a deft and poetic writer who weaves her tale with great dexterity."
2,Slow Moving History Book,This is a really slow moving novel which covers the life of one woman from age 16 to death. It's told in third-person omniscient and sometimes interrupts the narrative to tell the reader what will happen in the future. The narrator is detached from the story and never engaged me as a reader. The plot skips around from character to character and there are far too many to keep track of. Sophie's life is summarized rather than fully shown. The epilogue does not match the prologue or even the rest of the novel. I found this book really slow and uninteresting. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't get into it. The story of Sophie's childhood would make a great young adult novel.
4,Good Rock - Hard To Find Title,"This is a really good sophomore album by Maids of Gravity. It's not as good as their first album, at least in my opinion. But it is still a very good collection of songs and is not an easy title to find."
4,Sophmore effort keeps band being one of the best,"Maids of Gravity have created a second CD that is slightly different from their first while remaining just as good. A little less fuzzed out and a little more concise, they continue to rock in a unique and completely original way. Even some punk influence in this one too. Best songs are: Half Awake, Don't You Disagree, Light You Gave and It Don't Have To Be. Check out this disc and their debut as well. Hey Maids... how about a new one."
2,Yuk,"On the back cover of this book a reviewer describes the work as ""powerful."" It's certainly powerful all right, if you like to read repulsive, graphic descriptions of sick human behavior: a father [malesting] his 13-year old daughter, a man torturing an animal until it dies, a woman being violently beat up by her husband and hospitalized--and we won't even mention the leper trying to burn her hands off.In addition to the sicko stuff, the book features a 12-year old boy who reads a few classics and then during a river ride, begins spouting forth philosophy worthy of a learned sage. No 12-year-old boy talks like that; the speech was incongruous with the character.The book moves from a gritty, over realistic to-point-of-revulsion stance to a suddenly Pollyanna-type ending. It just doesn't play."
5,"Happy fish, clear pond","The goldfish in our pond love this food. Previous years we used a regular goldfish flake food, and always had algae problems (it never occurred to me there might be a different food for pond fish versus aquarium fish). I'm not sure if this food is what's helped so much this year, but this year we have a crystal clear pond and seemingly super happy fish. I know it, because this summer I could actually see them! I'm orderingPondCare 180 Spring & Autumn Pellet Fish Foodfor the cooler months."
1,Terrible,"If rap wasn't so terrible, Kia Shine wouldn't even think of making an album. Unfortunately for us, Hip Hop consumers are bombarded with awful artists, repetitive lyrics, and tired beats. ""Wow"" and ""Krispy"" are great examples of the genre's degradation. Though in ""Wow"" he responds to Nas' ""Hip Hop is Dead"" album with ""Hip Hop ain't playin dead/It live in the south/It must be a lie/Cuz it just bought me a house/It just got me a deal,"" it's a poor play.Sorry Kia, or Kinfolk if you prefer, but you ain't Hip Hop."
1,weak man really sad,i see why soutrhern rappers are picked on it's not the south everybody it's the wack music that's coming from down here.
2,Spring broke after a dozen uses,"I loved these tongs when I first bought them. They are beefy and will pick up a full rack of ribs with ease, which is why I bought them. However, the spring failed after about a dozen uses. It broke in the very center of the U-bend of the spring. The tongs themselves are sturdy, but the spring mechanism is cheap. I have since purchased a pair of Oxo 16"" tongs."
4,BBQ tongs,"Good product in general. One came a bit bent and the clever automatic lock unlock wouldn't work until I unbent it.I ordered 3, was billed for three and received 2. Amazon is now ""junk"" in my inbox."
4,Mesmerizing,"A mesmerizing book that is three separate tales told at the same time. At times humorous and sometimes it made me want to cry, this story was hard to put down. I would highly recommend it."
3,Getting Lost,"Although I have had an appreciation for Solnit's way with words in her past work, I was surprised by how lost I became while working my way through Getting Lost."
3,Haunting paths to the land of the lost,"The weaving of disparate yet hauntingly familiar story snippets, some historical some personal some ephemeral, was very effective in leading to the land of the lost, a transitional timeless state of mind and place. Although a bit uneven in structure, the author displayed an entrancing and inviting style which intrigues me to read more of her works."
3,a field guide to getting lost,"fine. but a little disappointed... did not appear to be a ""new"" book. as stated"
5,The Really Essential Doc Watson,"This is one of my favorite Doc Watson albums. It is a well chosen selection of songs, performed brilliantly by Doc and his son Merle. One of the nicest things about it is that it highlights Doc's ability to transform songs from all over the musical map into Doc Watson music. There's the blues of Mississippi John Hurt, fiddle tunes, Gospel, bluegrass, and old-time country. All in less than an hour."
5,Genius,"Paul Feig once dressed up as a woman for Halloween, as a kid, because he secretly wanted to. He didn't turn out to be gay, but he did turn out to be the director/producer of the Office (& also worked on Parks and Rec, Mad Men, 30 Rock and Arrested Development). There is something to be said about being different & uncool that makes you genius. I also recommend Paul Feig's book, Kick Me. Reading them together got my husband and I through the critical illness of our son last yr."
2,boring,"If you want to learn about Paul Feig's sex life...read this book. There isn't much humor in it, but you learn what a lame-o he was."
4,Search for lady love,"This is a man who bares his soul in the universal quest to find love. He also shares the shame and the cringe-worthy hilarity of the all-consuming attempts at finding love especially as an adolescence. I think many will find this book screamingly funny as he tells stories of awkward attempts at luring the opposite sex and discovering his sexuality. It is strangely sweet as well because really everyone has been there, (maybe not nearly ending up in a hospital trying out something new) and he reaches the dorky romantic in all of us who just wants someone to hold our hand and love us despite being uncool."
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be,"Feig's work on television and in movies is legendary at this point, but his memoir seems almost cobbled-together in haste. He stretches out tepid anecdotes to the point that I was bored through most of the chapters. Also, the misogynistic views of his teenage-self are off-putting. Doesn't compare to ""Bossypants"" or ""Girl Walks Into a Bar."""
3,Ok,"Unlike the big Raider stitch checkbook, this one does NOT come with the plastic check lining for duplicate checks. Other than a black leather cover and a puter logo on the side, this did not live up to standard. Three stars for the raiders logo and one star for the checkbook design or lack there of..."
5,Birthday Gift,"IT was a gift for my son and I had ordered one from ebay that turned out to be used. So I had to hurry and order another. I chose Amazon. It arrived very fast and was new very nice, excellent quality. I would recommend this seller and Amazon to everyone. Thank you very much!"
3,"Good info, but very little of it.","This book is only 92 pages long, and it has only few sentences per page. It really is no more than an informative, but skimpy brochure, and it takes about 10 to 15 minutes (tops) to read. Basicaly, the only information included is a very general definition of the types of foreclosure auctions you are likely to come across, and a list of addresses and web pages of institutions which might have forclosures available for sale. It is a great starting point, but don't expect any tips, tricks or advice, nor any information beyond the barest of minimum. It would be an OK place to start for someone who has no prior information whatsoever about forclosures, but I feel that the price of the book doesn't reflect the amount of info you get. Buy this book only if you can't find anything else."
2,Vague,"I was expecting more information than this book offered. It did contain some basic generic information, but bottom line was go and find out how to take advantage of foreclosures in your area by yourself. The entire book took an hour to read."
4,A wonderful performance but...,"This cd presents the best and most famous sacred works of Reformation England composer Thomas Tallis, including Spem in Alium, a gorgeous piece for 40 voices, and the poignant Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah. They are sung by a huge mixed choir, which gives the pieces a tremendous power.The rendition is first-rate and deeply moving.Unfortunately, the clarity of the recording leaves much to be desired. I have played this cd on several hi-fi players and the result has always been disappointing. The sound is muffled, muddy, it does not come out with full force and clarity.I recommend the ""Best of the Renaissance"" by the Tallis Scholars if you want to listen to a crystal-clear Spem in Alium and to ""Lamenta"" performed by Philip Cave et al for the Lamentations of Jeremiah."
3,Pretty good,"It is fairly easier to put together, but if young children try and put it together it will take a lot of time and the child needs to have a lot of patience and likes following directions. To paint the car would take a long time, but would like the actual car used in the movie. This is idyllic for someone who is an avid Ghostbusters fan."
3,"Not REALLY the Original, but Not Bad","I was hoping this was the same Pillsbury Space Food Sticks we knew in the 70's. But its not. That's not to say its not good, it is! But its a lot more like a big soft Tootsie Roll. I love Tootsie Rolls, so you could do worse, but if you are ordering thinking you'll be flooded with the taste of yesteryear, save your money. Its good, but its not the original."
5,A Great Snack!,"I originally bought the space food sampler, and of all the items inside, I LOVED the space food sticks! Even peanut butter was good, even though I usually dislike the taste of it. The small packaged energy bars are perfect when you feel like your sweet tooth is craving something chocolatey.Highly recommended!"
1,Nothing like they used to be in the 70's,Way to sweet. They are nothing like they used to be in the 70's.Maybe I should have gotten peanut butter. But they are probablyto sweet too. Oh well.....
2,Not so good.,"Way over-priced for what you get.. a couple dozen tiny sticks. But, the bad part, is that they do NOT taste like the originals from the 1970's. It is a totally different product, but same name... kinda tricky; I don't like that. I wanted the original. Why can't they get that recipe? Also, they are sickly sweet. They need to lay off on the sugar. Plus, no ingredients listed, so God only know what's in these things. They are cute for kids or something like a novelty gift, but that's it. P.S. Magnet is cheap, printed off a printer and super thin and flexible."
1,Poor Imitation,"The flavor and consistency are simply wrong- these ""Space Food Sticks"" only physically resemble the originals. If you're nostalgic for the taste of the originals, the food product that's closest is actually Tiger's Milk bars- the peanut butter ones in particular taste a lot like the original Space Food Sticks, though the consistency isn't quite as solid and they have a chocolate coating."
2,"Yes, It's A Tootsie Roll","I would eat half a box of the original Pillsbury sticks before we would get home from the grocery! They were long round sticks and soft enough to bend in half. These are like someone else said, more like a Tootsie Roll in flavor and texture. The box I ordered sat uneaten for months. If it had been the original it would have been gone in a week. Why include a magnet with original graphics when the new product isn't like the original? To taunt us?"
5,The1970s all over again,"I'm giving this five starts for nostalgia only because the taste, really, is fairly unpleasant. As a kid I used to hike the Grand Canyon quite a bit and these were great because, yes they are full of energy, but also they were light and didn't add to the backpack weight. I can't believe the price on these now because it's painfully obvious that they are priced for nostalgia. Enjoy if you can...still brings back memories."
2,Good but not the original.,"You can still buy original Space Food Sticks in Australia. In fact, the folks who make these new Space Food Sticks used to simply import the Australia ones and seal them in a baggie for resale.That said, I'm not sure why they choose to re-imagine the recipe for Space Food Sticks here in the US - I'm suspicious it may be because of the partially hydrogenated soybean oil (one of, if not the main ingredient of the original SFS)"
2,I would pass,"Had these when I was a kid and thought I would try them out after all these years.Well, I did not like them this time around. They have a weird film on them you can't see but can taste.Guess that's so they'll last for a long time?"
2,Not the Food Sticks of my childhood,"Space Food Sticks (Chocolate)I was very excited to see Pillsbury brought back Food Sticks and immediately ordered them. I am very disappointed. They are not even close to the Food Sticks of my childhood. If you're looking for that same great taste, don't bother. They are tolerable at best. Definitely will NOT be wasting any more money on them."
4,Good not great,"Good book. A bit overpriced, but good. Some great insights amid a lot of very old stories. Very smart, experienced authors."
4,Nek+Romantix !,"Yeah, they are good, but before you buy this album u should be sure what u want really. If you are into psychobilly or a newbie at this stuff it would be ok for you, but if you are a professional psychobilly listener pick another album of Nekro or some other bands, u cant find loud voices or bass like u can hear on HorrorPops albums, but somehow this album has good songs that u will love undoubtly. Good for archive as well with pretty album design =)siyarozen@yahoo.com"
3,I See Dead People.,"A very dark and maudlin take on surf-rock with a definite reach towards Psychobilly. The blatantly Christian-influenced vocal chanting and lyrics permeate the length of the album, favoring minor progressions. This mixes with an obsession with death, Satan, and Hotrods, reminding one of burning Zombie-corpse versions of Hellcat labelmates Tiger Army. The acoustic bass (which is consequently black, is shaped like a coffin, and features two black-and-white crosses) furiously slaps doghouse to keep time with the neurotic chord-changes. The trio from Copenhagen Denmark is: Kim Nekroman on coffin bass and vocals, Peter Sandorff on guitar and background vocals, and Kristian Sandorff on Drums. Definitely worth a listen if you are fan of amphetamine-soaked tremolo and brutally fast drum lines. (...)"
5,Brand new and worth it,"Item came in shrink wrap, brand new and exactly what my son needed for his Religion class. Worth the purchase"
1,Close but no cigar,"I ordered this bible because I wanted the new NABRE edition and liked the size of this particular one. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. What the product description does not tell you is that there's a full-page photo of pope on the one of the opening pages, which I personally find inappropriate for something as timeless as holy scripture. But if that doesn't bother you, then this may be a good buy."
4,Works great,"Exactly what I was looking for. I use this mostly for recording music with an external audio interface on my MacBook Pro. I often have to sit the laptop in odd places and I was worried that something would bump or lean against the USB plug and cause it to break or bend. This cable's profile is small enough that I don't have to worry about that anymore. The flexible connector makes it easier to work in tight spaces. I'm not sure why normal USB plugs have such a huge connector but this cable fixes that, plus you can position it however you want thanks to the ratcheting connector. Definitely recommended."
4,Satisfactory,"Filters arrived on time and in good shape, the dimensions are just a bit smaller than the stated 14x30, fit the return air housing a bit loose. Other than that, product is as advertised."
4,simple algorithms,"This book is a useful complement to ""Computational Geometry"" by de Berg. Both books overlap in key algorithms. The different expositions of this commonality might be useful if you encounter difficulty with the presentation in one text.The book has an excellent discussion of Voronoi diagrams. Perhaps if you are in solid state physics or crystallography, you have met these ideas before. Anyhow, methods are discussed for find diagrams in two and three dimensions. Roughly but essentially, there are strong similarities between these ideas and the finding of convex hulls in those dimensions.The level of maths treatment in the book is akin to a good undergraduate text on classical analysis in Euclidean n-space. Like Jerrold Marden's book, for instance.The authors have also thoughtfully provided several pretty colour plates that show graphics applications of ideas in the book. Good motivation for the reader."
5,"Love, love, love it",Okay so I initially bought these quite skeptically since I already have halogen kitchen lighting that illuminates over my kitchen counter. I bough these solely for design purposes. I also thought that this lighting would be overwhelming and the bullets would be large. This is not the case. The bullets were much smaller than I had anticipated and I was glad. It is a great design with that produces plenty of light. I bought this lighting with other lamps (see my other reviews) so for a design package this goes well. It was VERY easy to put together and the plug in was very simple to snap on. My light bill has also decreased DRAMATICALLY (even with LED ceiling lighting and solar energy). I am very happy with this purchase. The lights are a bit bright so you may need to play with the bullet a bit to get the correct light stream.
1,Save your money,"I am under 50 and have wrinkly hands from over exposure to the sun.I really thought this product would be great.I wanted to see if it made a difference so I only used it on one hand for 2 weeks as directed.Absolutely No Change! For a few minutes my hand looked better just because it is a lotion, but that lasts only a few minutes. Many inexpensive lotions make your hands look younger for longer and only cost under $5.00 to $10.00.I suggest to use sunscreen on your hands everyday a few times a day as it rubs off so you don't get further damage.I also find that some sun screen products make my hands look better."
1,horrible stuff,"I had used Hennalucent for over 20 years. When they discontinued the product I went on a search to find a replacement. Well, this is not it. This powder is gritty and hard to put on the hair. It doesn't cover very well and the color is wierd. I'll never use it again. I'll stick with the one with the fox on the cover.Rachel"
5,Quick and Efficient,The turnaround time was very fast - always preferred! I would definitely order from this seller again.
4,Local stores stopped carrying this product,"I use henna every six weeks to keep my hair shiny & full. Before I started graying, I used neutral. Now, I use a shade to gently help cover gray hair. It's natural & washes out over time.You need to know, it's not hair color & doesn't change your color much. You can't make your hair a lighter color. It highlights your hair color, with the shade you choose.Many beauty supply stores aren't stocking henna anymore. However, You can buy it on Amazon!"
2,Wrong meter sent,We ordered the Assess Low Range Peak Flow Meter because it was the one recommended by our doctor. The meter sent to us was an different one than the one we ordered. I kept it because I needed one and had so much trouble finding one locally. If I hadn't needed it so bad I would have sent it back. The one sent to me was Respironics Personal Best Peak Flow Meter it works fine but it still is not the one I ordered.
5,A Great (Small) Book on an Amazing Sculptor,"At 5x7 inches and 280 pages this lovingly curated and carefully edited book packs a wallop: Hundreds of photos show not only Deborah Butterfield's beautiful sculptures, but also illuminate her process through many fascinating glimpses behind the scenes. Add to that an incisive interview with New Yorker writer Lawrence Weschler, and you've got yourself a rich offering. If you're a Butterfield fan, or an artist eager to learn from another, this book is for you."
2,Size doesn't do the content justice,"Love the work --- had purchased this, thinking of it as a coffee table book, for myself and 2 friends (Christmas gifts). Was very disappointed with how small the book is in reality. This work deserves to be large."
2,just okay,My son is 7 months and has had this toy for about 2 months. He has hardly played with it. It just doesn't interest him.
5,I LOVE FREDDIE!,"This toy is a god-send! I have been through most of the toys similiar to this that I could find.. and this is the one of three that my son enjoyed paying with. I put this on his car seat when we go out and he loves to play with the wings and chew on the teether. He also really loves the mirror! Overall, I can say I LOVE THIS TOY and many of the other Lamaze hanging toys like the little turtle with a mirror on his tummy, the little red dog that barks when you squeeze his nose, and the activity cube!"
5,Great take along toy,We received this as a gift. Our daughter loved it. Great infant toy. She gnawed on this poor thing until she was 15 months old and it still looks good. Easy to clean with damp cloth.
5,Good as everyone says!,"Granted my baby is young, only 2 months now, but this toy gets her attention with its crinkly sounds and colors. I love all Lamaze toys!"
4,Cool item,"My 3 month old loves this toy in his car seat. He plays with it and his older brother will help him play with it. The connection piece does not hold up to him pulling on it. The toy comes off, only when he gets mad though. My 3 month old is also about 15 lbs and 28 inches long so he is a little strong. I like the different textual and visual stimulants."
5,A Great Toy,I have two children. My daughter is 17 months and my son is almost 4 months. They both love it. Freddie has so many interesting items to play with and I like the fact that I can attach it to just about anything with the clip on top. I also added another ring with a rattle to the bottom so my son can reach it when it is hanging. I think this is a great toy.
5,Still a favorite at 9 months,"My son still loves this toy at 9 months old! Freddie is also lighter (and quieter) than some of the other lamaze toys, which makes him very easy to hold on to and take with us everywhere we go. At $11.99 I am thinking about getting another one to have as a spare. A great toy!"
2,"I love it, the baby doesn't",I thought this toy was just adorable so I bought it for my baby for Christmas (she was 7 months at the time). She's 11 months now and has never spent much time playing with it.
5,Favorite Toy,"My son received this as a gift when he was just a couple months old. It was his favorite then, and still is at six months. He loves to crinkle the wings and chew on the rings. He waves it all around, and because it is plush it doesn't hurt when he hits himself with it. I highly recommend this toy!"
3,caught attention for a while,"Baby seems to enjoy this toy for a couple months, but no longer look at it much at 10-month-old."
5,another great toy from lamaze,"Freddie is a favorite at our house. My daughter loves all the MANY textures and sounds he makes and she loves to chew on the attached teether. Definitely worth the money, especially because he's portable and attaches to everything so he won't get lost. He also washes very nicely in the washing machine."
1,Not for the Young,This book is totally inappropriate for ANY child under sixth grade. The subject matter alone is too traumatic for anyone younger than that.Don't judge a book by its cover definitely applies here. The cover looks innocent but what's inside if far from it.
3,room for improvement,"At first I was pleased with the quality, finish and heft of this unit. However during assembly, it was apparent the the manufacturer cut corners. The screws which tighten the hooks that hold the bikes are so short that they do not reach the threads opposite. There is no manufacturer phone number, e-mail or web site information anywhere in or on the packaging. I had to make a trip to the hardware store to replace the 8 screws. I wanted this unit to save garage space for my 4 bikes. This unit actually uses more space because it is so tall."
4,Easy To Setup,"For the price, this is a very nice storage rack. It was easy to put together and relatively sturdy. I would advise you not to place it on carpet directly. Use something more sturdy like tile or carpet coasters.The only negative would be that the hooks slide down the poles to easily when removing your bike from the rack."
5,Great gear rack,"You would think by looking at this that it isn't sturdy because it's so tall and narrow. But I have had up to 4 bikes on this thing and it stays put just fine. Loading and unloading doesn't cause me any concerns at all. The fit and finish is good. Installation was very easy. Took maybe 30 minutes at most. It doesn't take up too much space either. I also keep other things on it like snowboards, and winter clothes hung along the rail. Perhaps my only complaint is that the hooks move too easily when trying to load my bikes. But once it's on, it'll stay. I got these a lot cheaper than it's selling for now, but knowing what I know now about the product, I may still pay the current price for this product."
5,Great Deal,"This is an easy to assemble rack that will hold 4 bikes in addition to skis or snowboards. It will free up garage or storage area. Top and side hangers for helmets, backpacks or whatever. Very happy with the rack."
1,Disappointed in the design,"I wanted to like this a lot, because it has the potential to be much sturdier than other units. However, the unit is much flimsier than it should be. Basically, this is because while there are many places that one piece of aluminum sleeves around another piece, in every case the sleeve is very loose and the two pieces are actually just held in place using a single screw. With some better design, there would have been some contact between the different pieces, making the unit much more solid as a whole. No problems yet, but for the cost I want a solid unit, something that feels sturdy. I mean, if you put 4 nice bikes on it, you want the unit to be bombproof. I'm thinking about making a few homemade shims out of aluminum foil to see if I can make it a little more sturdy.Ditto the person who said that they got an already opened one, so did I."
4,sturdy so far,"very unique appearing bike rack. Took a little effort to put together, but is holding 5 kids bikes very nicely in the garage, freeing up floor space. Also, the baskets are very handy storage spots for helmets, balls, etc. It is a little difficult for the younger kids to get their bikes off and on the utilty hooks, but all in all a nice storage piece."
4,not too bad,"I recentlypurchased this sander. I was very impressed by the power. It does have a problem keepingthe belt inline, but, overall,it is very light, and works quite well. I would recommend this sanderif you are lookingfor one and don't have too much cash."
4,9910 Makita Belt Sander,"If you are a normal handyman doing light work this sander is fine.If you are planning on sanding a full floor or doing huge work don't buy it!Despite what others have written here the belt under normal light use will last a very long time before it needs changing.However if you are going to expect this sander to do big work, then buy a big sander.Makita's next model up has a decent size belt and bigger gears.But again as I said for light work this is a light and handy size.If you intend on using it a lot, every so often you must take off the black outside plastic cover and clean the belt from any build up of dust.Any build up of dust inside this area will cause problems, I have taken this cover off and found dust all throughout, so it does get in there, ruins the belt chews the gears,,,,, routine maintenance will save the day.If you try to run it with any slip it will ruin the two sets of built gears inside.Mike."
1,drive belt broke third time I used it,"This is a decent-looking sander, but the drive belt between the motor and the belt broke after less than an hour of use. I removed the belt and saw that it's about 1/4"" wide and about 1/16"" thick, and is reinforced only by a few cloth strands. I called Makita at their customer service number and was politely told that I could take the sander 25 miles from my zip code to their nearest service center for warranty repair, or they would sell me a new belt for $3.30 plus $6.95 shipping and handling. Shipping for this 10-gram belt should be under $2; I think that handling charges should not be applied to warranty repairs. I ordered two belts for a total of $14 since I don't anticipate the next one lasting very long either, and I will think carefully before buying another Makita tool."
5,Just Juice,"Dear Karen Hesse,Just Juice was a great book!It also taught me 3 lessons!You should try this book to have a fun time reading books.Sincerely,Emily Cheung"
5,Just Juice Is Just Plain Good,"This book was very good I liked it a lot. The author Karan Hesse is a very good writer. I would give this book ten stars if I could! In the book, a girl named Juice is always getting into trouble. Juice can not read very well so she and her six sisters are trying to help her read. Her mother is having a baby and her father needs to find a job in order to pay the bills so Juice never goes to school so that she can help her father find one. Some people can relate to this story. This book deserves an award. I give it five stars."
5,"IF YOU ""LOVE"" BILL MONROE MUSIC CHECK THIS OUT !!","This is a great group of talent that really can play ""Bill Monroe Bluegrass"", who also knew and played with Bill, clearly loved his music and did it real justice. I'll bet Bill himself loved this CD. A great tribute to the Bill Monroe legacy."
5,Scamp ...... A Must !!,"Jerry Jeff kept me company through college with ""Viva Terlingua, A Man Must Carry On, Riding High and Driftin' Way of Life"". As the years drifted, so did I, until I recently encoutered ""Cowboy Boots and Bathin Suits"", it's good to be home! ""Boots and Suits"" lead me to ""Scamp"", Jerry Jeff shines, and his music has grown with his experiences.As for the editorial review comparing ""Scamp"" to Lovett's latest, I don't get it, Lyle is great but Jerry Jeff sings of years of experience and dosen't need the constant wit to sell or connect with his fans.""Manny The Hat Man"" .... would of loved to have meet him. ""Scamp"" is a must for Jerry Jeff fans, Great Stories. Thanks Jerry Jeff!"
4,"Cheerful & sunny, but with depth & variety","That sums up this wonderful CD done buy the drummer for Mojave 3 and his buddies. It sounds effortless, but it's not. It just breezes by, and would be a great musical accompaniment to a fun road trip."
2,a medicore device,"I bought the device for use in 2005 Nissan Murano. The first device was defective, and the company quickly replaced it. For that, I gave credit to its customer service. The new device works, but the performance is not great. I made phone calls via the device, the listeners complained my voice was too low, especially when driving on free ways. The FM channel has unpredictable static noise while driving here and there. Now I decide to return it. I guess it is the universal problem for all FM-bluetooth devices."
1,Dissapointment,"This product sounds aweful on the receiving end. In the car it sounds great through the car speakers but to the caller, it sounds like your in a steel garbage can. I returned the original one ordered because I thought there was a problem with it. The second one I received is just as bad. I stopped using it soon after I received it. I don't know if I can send it back for a full refund. Not worth the money, sorry Satechi."
3,microphone,It works really well for streaming music but if you are trying to talk on the phone you still have to hold the phone to your head so that ppl can hear you talk... thus eliminating the handfree phone call
2,It's ok - but far from great,I bought two of these. One for my wife and one for me. The sound quality of the music is just ok. You have to have the volume way up to hear the music and there is often much static / disruption. When you unplug make sure your radio is off or on another station because you will go deff from the blast of white noise. The phone feature of this product SUCKS! If your buying this for that reason do not waste your money.
2,Doesn't work for me.,"Person that I am calling cannot hear me well enough to understand me when I am talking, using this device."
4,Driving security,"I purchased this wireless fm transmiter because I do not like bluetooth direct into my ear, I believe those bluetooth distract people when we are driving: so this bluetooth resolved my problem. It is important spend some time looking for the best station to use it.Music work much better than phone, music sound clear and stereo; phone call: receive better tan transmite, is necesary speake loud and clear to the person who we are speaking listening OK. In generally is a good product wich I may reccomended to listen music and speak by phone security and continius listing music when we finish to talk."
5,Works great!,"After reading the reviews, I settled on this Satechi. Unlike other handsfree devices that I have tried, this actually works almost as well as an OEM bluetoothed radio. People can hear me with no problem though they say it has a bit of an echo. Yes, I do turn up the volume, but I don't have to turn it up all the way. As others have stated, setup was a breeze. Connected with my iPhone 3gs immediately and every time. I'm using it in a 2001 Subaru that doesn't have an aux jack. I listen to XM through it and it sounds great. Occasional static but no big deal. Wish I had gotten it sooner. Fortunately I have a switched plug so I don't have to worry about turning it off or unplugging it. The plug itself fits very snugly so you don't have to worry about it coming out of the aux plug, which my other devices would disconnect because they were kind of loose in there."
3,Good but annoying,"So when it works it works great... But I have an iPhone 3s and it seems like evertime I get close to a wifi zone that I have approved for use (ie home, around the local mail) it kicks the Bluetooth off. It is so annoying. Then in my case the phone will not automatically connect so then I have to go my setting and reconnect. I like the device but it just confirmed to me that I want a Bluetooth receiver built in to my next car."
5,The best FM transmitter!!!!!!,I thought for an fm transmitter it was a little pricey but u get what u pay for. This is a great FM trasmitter i got it linked up with my Droid x and now i can listen to my pandora internet radio and everything else.. Also good for the built in turn by turn navigation ... This is worth every penny!!!!
4,Bluetooth Stereo A2dp Hands-Free Fm Transmitter Car Kit,I bought this product for use with my Samsung SGH-A707 Cell Phone and I'm very pleased with the way it works. The phone communicates with this device via BlueTooth and then relays the signal to my car stereo via an FM transmitter. Since it does transmit to your car radio you may occasionally pick up some static but the advantages far out way that minor problem. It is very easy to hear people on the phone as well since it comes over your car stereo and you can make it as loud as you want. So far nobody has complained about being unable to hear me either so it must work equally well in both directions. The product is more expensive than I would have liked and I wish it had next song/previous song buttons so I didn't have to fumble with my phone while I'm driving but overall I am extremely happy with the product and highly recommend it. I am also extremely happy with the customer service of Satechi. Their staff is extremely helpful and friendly
1,"Great concept, poor implementation","I liked the idea of this product, and it worked pretty well -- for a week.It literally came apart in my hand when I tried to pull the unit from my DC power outlet [VW Jetta, not a tricky location]. The plastic casing is pretty easy to pull apart, the red wire pulled off the circuit board. I'm not a big guy and there was no abuse, just a simple pull and a surprise.I called Satechi's customer service line, a very nice woman instructed me to send an email to ""Sales"" and give my order info and a brief explanation of what happened.I did. Nothing. This was months ago.So, a great idea but cheesy construction and a disconnect in service.I bought a newer edition Transdock for iphone instead and dropped back to my bluetooth headset. :("
4,Easy alternative to re-wiring,"This item performs as advertised. I have a Honda Ridgeline and it didn't come with mp3 input - it's an '06 - and I have considered getting one of the line-in setups, but they are much more expensive and weren't immediately compatible with the iPhone 4 software. We were going on a road trip and decided to get this one based on the features and reviews. The wireless music over Bluetooth works great, but the volume is much louder when you plug in directly to the unit. I get static once in a while and just bump one station up to solve the problem. Charging is also supported through USB cable but I haven't used it yet. The unit is a little tricky to get used to - for example, if you're on a call and get into the car, the call will start to play through the unit, but you can always switch back on the phone itself. Really happy with this purchase!"
3,low volume,the only problem i have with this product is the sound quality you have to turn up the sound twice as high as the normal radio stations
5,Slick and Easy Satechi,I purchased this Satechi Bluetooth Hands-free Car Stereo Fm Transmitter for my iPhone along with a windshield mount because there seems to be a scarcity of all in one transmitter/carkits for the iPhone of the windshield mount variety.The transmitter/carkit I originally purchased had a short flexible plugin arm into the lighter socket but because as with most cars the lighter socket is down low it makes looking at your iPhone for directions somewhat hazardous for oneself and other drivers.The Satechi is excellent. It plugged in easily and sits somewhat discretely down in the lighter socket. Fortunately my car radio was already on the channel that the Satechi was factory set to so I did not even need to adjust this. I just turned on my iPhone Bluetooth and paired it with the Satechi by typing in the factory code. It paired within seconds and boom I was ready to go.
1,fm adapter,"Hard to setup, cannot connect to the car sterio system even when blue tooth function was not used. Had to return the item would not recommend."
2,"Okay, but not what I expected",I was really excited when I got this item. I really enjoyed using it. The big con was that depending on the vehicle I was using it in(I have a work van that I got it for) it was hard to hear me. To my surprise after I hadn't used it in a month and was going out of town for work and wanted to be able to stream music while I was driving. It quit working. I had only used it maybe 20-30 times over the course of 6 months. I wish I could recommend it but I can't Now just a dead piece of junk
3,"Works, but too pricey for the quality","Transmission quality will entirely depend on the amount of interference in you're area. With that said, besides the occasional minor static noise, the device works well. However, it is cheaply manufactured and quite fragile. The cigarette-lighter end easily unscrews and comes undone on its own with repeated removal (wife puts it in her purse when not in use)... small metal contact nib went missing because of this, so I had to cannibalize an old car charger to replace it. The Buttons are cut out in a very odd manner that allows for dust and dirt to collect underneath them. I could see this as a $25 cheap-o purchase, but at nearly $60 I would not buy it again based solely on manufacturing quality. Spend the extra money and buy something heavier, slimmer, prettier, and less prone to come apart. I feel 3-stars is a touch generous, but again, it works, so I can't be too harsh."
4,Better than buying a whole new stereo.,"My 2005 Mazda3 doesn't have an auxiliary jack, so this is the next best thing. It gets the job done and the music is loud and clear, however there will always be some static interference or tone coming through. This could be because I live in a highly populated area where almost every frequency is in use by a radio station. It is possible that those in a rural area would have better luck using the device."
5,Highly recommend,"I am very pleased with the performance of my Satechi bluetooth transmitter. It is way better than the four or five cheaper transmitters of various brands I have had. The truly amazing thing though, is after I had mine about a year, I broke it by pulling it out of the lighter socket of my truck (which is very tight) by grasping the body of it and yanking. I called the company to see if they could repair it and they said send it back and we'll send you a new one. I did and they did! A brand new one with no cost to me but the postage to send the old one back! I call that premier customer service!"
5,Excellent product for wireless music!,"This is a great piece of technology! My iPhone 4, iPod Nano and iPod Touch 4 all play music wonderfully through this gizmo. Concerning the phone, I can hear callers perfectly but have been told they cannot hear me so well, however we live in a very rural area so could be the carrier signal and not the Satechi. I had also read in a previous review that the flashing blue light was irritating at night but it has never flashed while I have been using it so not sure why that purchaser was having that problem. Also, you can simply turn the light away from you if it is a bother. All in all, an excellent product which I am VERY happy to have purchased!"
3,Its alright,"After almost a year of having this the digital display stopped working. meaning I can't see what frequency its on, I have to use the radio to find it. You have to turn up the volume quite a bit to hear it too, and I also find that having to pull it out of the socket all the time gets annoying. better to have an on\off switch. but it does its job of letting me listen to my HTC incredibles MP3 player, just not very loud."
4,Satechi FM unit,"I used to have a Griffin FM unit where you I had to carry a whole string of frequencies as songs to connect to an available station on your radio. The unit attached to my iPod and rarely worked very well. The Satechi connects very easily, at least initially, and streams my iPod content quite well, maintaining good quality. I imagine if you listened to rock it would be ideal. I listen to jazz and classical and my only complaint is that I have to turn the volume up totally to hear well. If the Satechi could boost the signal so the level was better, it would be ideal."
5,Updated review,"I loved this product from the beginning but noticed it was only operating on one of the two stereo channels. Sent a short text to Satechi, received email back the same day that they had already shipped out a replacement with a prepaid box for return of the defect product. How Awesome is THAT!!!!!!!!!"
4,A2DP Great! Handsfree not so much,"This product is great, it's super hard to find a FM Transmitter that will do A2DP. I love it. I can stream shoutcast streams to my stereo via my cell phone and listen to stuff that would never be played on terrestrial radio.The hands-free doesn't work great. It's usable but people complain that the can hear echoing. I bought this for the A2DP so I'm not bummed about the lack luster hands-free performance.I have no complaints about the A2DP functionality, it works perfectly!"
2,Another one bites the dust...,"The GOOD:With the half dozen or so FM transmitter units I've tried, this one had the absolute best stereo quality with little noise while listening to music of them all.The BAD:This unit was completely useless for phone conversations. First, the level of the caller's voice was so much softer than the music, that I would have to turn up the radio volume quite a bit, and of course if I would forget to turn it back down when the call was over, I was in for quite a shock when the music restarted. Also, the caller not only complained about the echo when I spoke, some found it to be even painful. I wound up returning this to the supplier."
1,Piece of Junk do not buy,Low quality Chinese made junk returned it the same day. the display went dead and the part that plugs into the car charger came loose
4,product works and sounds great!,"This product works great! I store 1000s of songs on my HTC 8525 running Windows Mobile 6 (6gb microsdhc memory card). Now I can play these songs over my car stereo - the sounds quality is very good. Furthermore, I use to not be able to hear my phone calls when I was driving on the freeway due to road noise. Now I play the calls thru my car stereo and I can just 'turn up the radio volume'. There was one issue when I tried to reconnect the phone to the product - but I hear this is due to a WM6 bug. To get around the issue I installed a free utility called AD2Ptoggle (use google to search the internet and you'll find it). It placed a button on my Today screen so now to reconnect to the car radio I just need to push a button. Works great."
3,Good product with design limitations,"This product operates as advertised but has design limitations you would expect in that if your power plug is located in a less than ideal place, people can't really hear you speaking well."
4,The best FM transmitter I have tried so far but it can be better.,"I had tried different brands like Belkin and Griffin, but none worked well, waste of money.I was very skeptical about this device, especially that I had never heard about this brand and the tag price. I decided to give it a try and it met my expectation on my iPhone 4.It is ease to use and the reception on my radio station is pretty solid, no static at all.I noticed when you connect it through Bluetooth the volume is a little low but work well. If you use it with the audio cable the sound is perfect. Also when i was on the phone it was a little hard to hear and people could not hear me well either.I think they should work on this and they will have and exceptional product.I recommend this product. It works pretty good on my iPhone 4."
5,BEST FM TRANSMITTER for iphone,"BEST FM TRANSMITTER for iphone.....i bought a LOT & i mean A LOT Fm Transmitters & all of them sucks .but this is a true piece of device , u'll love it .don't hesitate to buy it & don't waste ur money on other junks ."
4,Works Surprisingly Well,"The biggest trick is to try a several FM bands and find one with minimal interference. Once I found a quiet band, I was surprised how good the music from my iPhone sounded. Even at full volume it was great.The sound quality of the phone is OK, not great, but usable. I use this mostly for music, and only occasionally for calls, so I'm very happy with it."
2,Works ok,"Not impressed by the loss of volume, I have to have ipod volume on high and car stereo almost full blast. Otherwise it works good and synchs up quick.Does not come with usb charger cord, which for the money would have been nice, no biggie I use the one from my ipod charger. I would have looked harder at other brands if I had known they still can't make one of these 5 star rated."
1,Disappointing static noise - bacon frying - high rating a mystery,"I bought this based on the good review rating, however it is a mystery to me why this has been rated so well. Perhaps expectations are low for most people. For me it is unacceptable. During the non-loud moments (playing music or a phone call) you hear a very annoying static sound, similar to the sound of bacon frying. I have tried this on all three of our cars and the results are the same. If you crank up the music and the music selection has no quiet passages, the audio quality is barely acceptable."
2,Not that good,"Pro:Easy setup, looks good, it works as intended.Con:Audible humming on audio out connection, (tried different cables, using iphone 4 as bluetooth source). Fm signal volume is low."
3,$129 is too expensive for what it is supposed to do.,"Supposedly more of these will be available in September at $129.00However, no one needs to wait. Buy one ANYCOM FIPO (Bluetooth to iPod) for about $60.00 and one Sonnet Podfreq for about $24.00 for either iPod nano or mini or of the other ones and you have a MORE flexible setup than you will get with the above carkit. Not only would you be able to stream your MP3 files from your bluetooth enabled phone but you also would be able to plug in an iPod into it. YES, I have both Anycom FIPO and Sonnet Podfreq for iPod nano and YES I tested it in my BMW using my Motorola KRZR K1. I was able to stream my MP3 from my KRZR to my car stereo. Sonnet produces very strong FM signal and was able to override even some existing stations. But Podfreq needs to be plugged in since Anycom FIPO does not have a battery. But I am thinking I should be able to power it from my phone via the mini-usb port."
3,Sensitive to heat?,"I would love to give this device 5 stars because it's wonderful when it's working properly. However, I've had problems with it when the unit is warm. I'm not sure why this is, but I've had to hold the unit up to the A/C vent in my car to get it working again.I live in Los Angeles, the city of too much sun. When I leave my car parked while I'm at work or at home on a weekend, it's usually hotter inside than it is out by the time I get back in. If I leave the unit in the car, the FM broadcast signal is terribly weak and my car stereo won't pick it up. It literally won't work until I cool it down.Other than that the device is great. I can listen to the ESPN Radio app, various online radio streams and anything else my iPhone can play."
2,wish it lasted longer,Doesn't work after about a year of use. Up until then it paired with the iphone 4 fine. I guess I got my $70 bucks out of it though.
2,worked great until it stopped working,I bought two of these for my daughter and her boyfriends cars.They worked great until three months later when my daughters just stopped working.
5,Hands free calls and music,"This is a great product that is worth very dime. Installation was very simple. I was up and running is less than five minutes. Successfully paired with my android tablet/phone (Hauwei Ideos s7) quickly. I just used the default station of 88.1 on the device. Tuned my car radio to the same frequency and started some music on my Droid. AWESOME! Made some test outgoing and incoming calls and everything worked great! You can't beat this... We just bought a new car with the factory installed bluetooth SYNC option. That option cost $600. The SATECHI cost 1/10 the price of the factory installed bluetooth and it does the same thing. This is not an exaggeration. Additionally, I can move the SATECHI to any of our other 3 non-bluetooth enabled cars and it works great. It even works with the marine stereo on our boat."
4,Fantastic product that delivers as promised,The Satechi transmitter is exactly what I needed and expected. It's utterly simple to use and setup. Less expensive than several other solutions I researched. Integrates perfectly with voice command features.
4,Satechi Bluetooth FM Transmitter for iPhone.,"I use this with my iPhone 3Gs. Easy to use and set up. The only problem I have is that the microphone is in the lighter plug and sometimes my voice is not clear to those receiving my calls. It seemsusing the microphone on the phone would be better.It may be able to do this, and I have not figured it out, but an off switch with the unit would be nice, rather than having to pull it out of the accessory plug.I had a question, and Customer Service at Satechi was excellent."
3,"Slightly above average, but still needs improvement.","I purchased the Monster 1000 and the Flexsmart to compare to the Satech. I returned the Monster, whcih didn't compete. I love the Flexsmart, so I kept that, and I kept the Satech even though it wasn't as good as teh Flexsmart. It is good for music transfer, with the only complaint I have being the car stereo volume needs to be turned up louder than normal (my iphone music settings are correct). But people I call complain about not being able to hear me very well. Overall good product, but call quality could be improved."
5,Great product,This is great for getting rid of those wires in your car. Its paring and connecting via Bluetooth seems faster than some of my other Bluetooth devices. I have the unit plugged into the outlet in the rear of my car and it still works great for talking on the phone. Go to this website and find unused frequencies for your area and/or those that you regularly travel to: [...]
2,Bluetooth is a joke!!!,"I ordered this because of other reviews stating how good the signal was on the radio but never saw any one say how the Bluetooth worked. Well i dont know if i have a defective Satechi but when i use the Bluetooth with my Evo phone it has to been within two feet of the Satechi transmitter. what a joke, whats the point of having bluetooth if i cant pickup my phone. the phone disconnects bluetooth feature because its more than two feet away. I called customer service to see if i received a defective item. i will update this review if thats the case. I dont recommend this item."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome BLUETOOTH device. Once again AMAZON comes through. Looked at big and small electronic stores, bought a few and they all worked horribly. With the SATECHI, no interference from outside sources like power lines, other radio stations bleeding over like with other makers of FM/BLUETOOTH claiming to have clarity. If you have an older car that you want to play your music from your MP3, IPhone etc. This is worth it!TRRCalifornia."
3,Amazing insights / Beware of Agenda,"As I read this book it opened my eyes to many areas of my personal life and our culture. I started this book knowing that the author is a Jungian therapist and author of The Tao of Psychology, I knew I was going to be reading a book with this persuasion. I found it to be more of an agenda than I was looking for."
4,"Good book,","The book was very interesting and pretty easy to read. I do feel some of the explanation here and there was lacking and at times hard to follow the Greek Deities from memory without much further explanation. Other than that I did learn a lot and really had fun reading it, I would recommend it to any friend wanting a little insight into a man."
1,MIssing hardware,"I picked this turntable bearing up at a local store (yes, same brand and model) a couple days ago, and noticed it didn't include screws. The directions call for #6 (metric) self-tapping sheet screws, which I was able to find. I had a lot of trouble trying to get the screws to hold - they needed to be deep enough that the thread of the screw held the plate, but not deep enough that the end of the screw dragged against the other plate. This was easier said than done, because the threads on self tapping screws (even the short ones) don't start at the end of the screw. It was a hassle and I've ended up shopping for a new bearing for the lazy susan. The bearings might be sold and roll nicely, but implementing it is so difficult/convoluted I'd say this was junk."
3,Half of what I expected. Pay attention to details. The Echos bonus disc is a DEMO only.,"My bad, didn't pay attention to the part that said the echos bonus disc was a demo only. Don't make the same mistake I made. Off to buy Echos."
4,Really fun but really hard,"This is worth getting if you can devote the time and energy to completeing the game. It's also worth getting for your collection. With the added bonus disk, it instantly becomes a collectors prize in my book."
5,great game,This one is going for a Christmas present but It has been played before. it was traded in at a game store by accident but we now have it back and its new owner is going to love it.
5,Awesome Game and Packaging,"This package was listed as ""very good"" when it was actually like new. No scratches, perfect packaging, and a manual. My kids thought it was their original disk they lost eons ago. Nice!"
2,A Little Deceiving,"Please be aware that this is only a DVD. It does not come with a music book. Even though the Title is: Beginner Violin DVD With Music Book... The merchant claims the music is on the DVD screen, but it only teachers you to play one very basic piece.The audio on the DVD is also very low. Would not recommend."
1,Did NOT meet my expectations,"The image and reviews of this item sold me on the purchase. I wish there had been more online information on it though due to what we discovered after receiving it.The quality of this product is sub-par by any professional standards. As was stated in the other review, it appears to have been filmed by and edited by amateurs.Definitely NOT the quality video and audio I expected to see with the price charged.The information contained in it's disks may be great, but I could not sit past the second disk due to its lack of quality.This may well be the end all be all for some out there but for me, I expect professional audio/video from a commercial DVD. This product does not deliver that."
5,WANT TO BE CHALLENGED?,"This puzzle is very well made, the pieces are a good size & are well cut. It isone of the most difficult puzzles we have attempted. Many different parts are asimilar color. Great picture, but a large challenge. This is one that is not likelyto be finished quickly."
3,Jigsaw puzzle,"This is a very frustrating puzzle to do. The picture is done in ""impressionist"" style and is fuzzy making it almost impossible to tell where a piece should be placed. My husband and I work on these together and agreed that we like challenging puzzles but that this was so irritating we would never do it again. We have done many other puzzles but never known one to be so continuously annoying!"
2,"""It's Hard""","If you like a hard puzzle, this one is for you. I'm not a fan of this type of puzzle, but I do like the picture. All the pieces are like an Impressionist painting. Up close, most of the pieces look like a blur of color with very little, if any, detail. But once all the pieces are put together and you stand back, you can see what the picture is. I spent hours starring at it and probably only fitted five pieces. There were only one or two pieces that I saw that could have been cut finer. I had fun, but if I can help it, I will avoid buying this kind of puzzle in the future."
2,fun challenging puzzle,We found this puzzle challenging and fun to do. Like another reviewer we were missing a piece at the end of the puzzle which is why we gave it a 2 overall.
5,Good Quality,"Will buy this manufacturer again. Pieces are larger than most, not all cut out with same dye, fit together well."
4,The Old General Store 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle,"It was a lot of fun to put together, especially since we like the old fashioned look"
4,Does what it should,Cheap and works - little else to add.Of course at that price it is light plastic and one could pay $50 for a heavy metal piece that does the same job but looks better; why bother?
5,I Gonna Paper My Cell With It.,"Soon as Trixie git done readin' it, I gonna rip da pages out an' paper ma cell wid it. Dat way I kin reads it day an night. It make me laff an laff, like when Trixie wrap a towel all up in her hair and balance a pot on her head an sing ""Pupusas, papusas!"" Trixie move just like a real girl."
3,Cute,Cute movie but my 3 year old thought it was a little scary. Some of the references to LOTR are pretty forced.
4,We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for 3 stinkin' days!,"Entertaining as usual with Veggie Tales with quite a few references to the actual Lord of the Rings. For people who have not seen the Lord of the Rings they'll miss some of the best parts, which is why we only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I have already loaned it to two friends, a 24 year old LOTR fan and a high school freshman who was very excited to watch it. That being said, it does contain some adult humor but nothing inappropriate for children. Watch for the Keebler Elf and the sporks for extra laughs. And loved those hairdos also. A great movie!LAS"
1,Christian Programming - agenda not disclosed.,"Christian Cartoons - they should be labeled as Christian or Religious. I was sitting with my son when suddenly it was ""Christian programming"". This should be labeled clearly for all of us."
1,Did not care for it,"My 4yo son likes the Lord of the Rings characters, but is not allowed to watch that movie yet because of the violence. We thought this would be a fun alternative, but the story and characters are so different that there really wasn't any cross-over appeal (but that could be because of copyright laws I guess). We both got bored watching it, and there was a heavy-handed discussion about God and Jesus at the end (although I guess that is standard for Veggie Tales, which I did not know). We just didn't care for this movie."
4,Veggie Tales,Good shows for the kids to sit and veg-out to. They teach children good moral lessons regardless of your religion!!!!
5,Highly informative and recommended,"It's great to see all of Rothko's paintings all together from the very beginning to the very end. A worthwhile, well researched, and well executed project visually. The sheer size of the book which is akin to a massive dictionary makes reading the essay without a table for support quite a challenge but this is an unavoidable inconvenience. I have heard that there is a new updated edition coming out soon."
3,Catalogue raisonné,"Des presses université Yale, j aurais aime plus de soin dans les reproductions qui rendent mal la subtilité du travail de Rothko."
3,Works OK,The dvd works great on +R dvd DL but not at all on -R DVDs. Their fix doesn't work and support is spotty and so far not helpful.
4,Good Drive OK Software,"Drive works great. The software is just ""ok"". I'd like to see Roxio or Nero in the bundle."
4,Insightful Reading,"Great historical reading from a Catholic Saint, under a trance-like state, wonderful revelations were revealed. The reading of this book is very emotionally enriching."
4,Looking for ways to use those scraps,This book is more of an idea/technique book than a pattern book so while it does have only three patterns all of the pictured quilts are made using these blocks. There are plenty of suggestions for making your own version and of course the pictures give lots of inspiration. All of the quilts could be done in either scrappy as well as colour co-ordinated which is great for those looking at ways to use up scraps.
1,Disappointed,"Although they're pretty, this book in mostly pictures of quilts. And if you're looking for instructions for these quilts, you'll find only 3. In my opinion it's not worth the price."
1,awful awful,"this toy is poorly made. The holes for some of the pieces don't match up, so the pieces don't fit. The pieces break as you are snapping them together and the entire thing falls apart very easily. Very dissapointed."
5,review,"The book I received was in excellent shape, and the timing of it's arrival from the time I ordered it was very pleasing."
2,Giving Ryrie a fair read.,"MacArthur quotes Ryrie's So Great Salvation but after reading The Gospel According to the Apostles I am not so sure he did read it. Ryrie tackles some ""straw man"" issues in his book So Great Salvation which MacArthur seems to ignore that chapter. It seems MacArthur is so blinded by his own position he can't appreciate the position of Ryrie.He quotes Ryrie's SGS but when he writes in chapters 2 and 3 of his TGATTA he didn't read the early chapters of SGS. Seems MacArthur only wants to quote Ryrie when it will give him a better presentation of his position. In short, I think it distorts Ryrie's point and creates a straw man."
4,great show,"i bought this for my son. he loves ghost stories, and the haunted history series is very entertaining, and not too scary. we got this episode because we've been to some of the locations. the only reason it doesn't get five stars is the length."
4,This book is really great!,"I think this book is really great! I love the ""Ugly Feet Are Beautiful"" very much because I love Ballet!"
5,Another favorite,"I enjoyed reading this years ago, as well as recently. It's a good book to read when you're not in the mood for anything too long or detailed, yet it has a good plot and everything wraps up nicely in the end."
3,Lots of facts with a few nuggets,"The book reflects a deep well of study, with numerous names and titles given as sources and examples. It tends to be dry but contains bits of very interesting information. Some background in Japanese helps to wade through all the names, but for someone interested in an in-depth study of the Edo period this book has much to offer."
1,"boy, this baby is bad!","Just because you have a camera doesn't mean you should make a movie. This one has everything: Bad production, bad acting, bad editing, etc. However, some cute girls. This thing looks like it was made for 5 bucks and was written by a 10 yr. old. Maybe a video by some teenage neighborhood film nut and some friends. But not a professional movie."
2,Pregnancy Journal,"I ordered this pregnancy journal along with another pregnancy record book for my sister who is expecting her first child. There was no description for this book, so I wasn't sure what it was like. I was looking for something for her to record special events, thoughts and feelings, pictures, doctor appointments, etc. This book is definitely a 'journal'. It has three sections - one for each trimester - with plenty of lined pages, but no specially designated places for specific information. It's just a spiral-bound, hardcover 'notebook' designed to keep a diary during your pregnancy."
1,"Fiction, not fact","For all of Dr. Goodrich's energetic prose, she understands neither the medieval Arthurian Grail tradition nor the variant forms of the Grail tradition as they existed in medieval culture. Judging by the visual arts, a form of the Grail history was known possibly as early as 200 C.E. with the tradition exploding in popularity during the Middle Ages. Variant Arthurian tales (most of which bring the Grail to Europe in the time of Joseph of Arimathea, the first century C.E.) can be accounted for by historical impact from the Sanct Sang traditions, by legends of sacred treasure, and by folk traditions, some of which still flourish today. The Grail story is Continental in origin and transmits to the British Isles well after the dates it appears in the Rhine region, Brittany, and southern France. Dr. Goodrich weaves an eminently believable fantasy that she misrepresents as historical fact and that is doing her readers a grave disservice."
1,I did throw it across the room...,"One of the reviewers said they waded 50 pages into this swamp before they gave up. I didn't make it that far before tossing it. To repeat the others, this book is unreadable, full of run-on sentences with endless commas that leave you wondering which verb goes with which object. Glad I didn't buy it. Back to the library it goes. Wish I could write a warning to the curious on the cover in big bold letters: ""NO!""."
3,"Cool product, but didn't look brand new on arrival","I really wish I had read the other person's review before purchasing these. The exact same thing happened with mine. I bought these for my husband for Father's Day & they just arrived in the mail and do not look brand new. The packaging is dented & tattered and the actual product (where the packaging doesn't cover it) is dirty & scratched. I had no idea that I could purchase a product labeled ""brand new"" and have it arrive at my house looking used. I most likely will not be giving this as a gift because it would be embarrassing, so it was a waste of money and now I don't have a gift."
3,Traveling Pads,"These are nice thick pads that covered the bottom of our chair legs perfectly. After application the chair slid nicely on the hardwood floors and wasn't wobbly or unbalanced. Within a week I noticed that the pads had all traveled and were half on and half off of each chair leg.Removing each pad and reinstalling with a glob of white glue solved the traveling problem, but I would rather the pad solution not be a two step process."
4,Playhut Boutique Review,"This product is for my 2 year old. It is very nice for pretend, but I am very, very, disappointed in the mirror that was placed with this toy. It suggested that it's a mirror for a ""boutique"". But there is absolutely NO RELECTION in the so-called mirror. That is what it is all about, to see yourself in the mirror. If possible, I want some type of compensation in reference to this flaw. You should not try to deceive your customers. Aluminum foil would have been better!"
3,Not as shown in the picture,"I bought this Boutique for my daughter B-day, who turned 6 yrs old in Nov. I needed something a bit bigger so the 2 yrs old can also fit inside. The picture on Amazon looked gorgeous, but the one I received was not the same. The colors were lighter, not as intensive, and the purple curtain was missing, which took away some of the cuteness. Worst yet, it came with a 2-3"" rip along one of the sewing lines.In addition, there were two set of curtains (opposite to each other) instead of one. The entry door hasn't not hold up well. Every child is different, but mine preferred not to have the second opening as she wanted to treat it more like a house."
3,My daughter loves it but it seems flimsy to me!,"I bought this for my almost 2 year old and frankly, she loves it. She goes in and out all the time. I bought it b/c it folds small (although I haven't figured out exactly how it folds into a small circle) and could be easily stored. However, my daughter will not let me put it away. So now it is out. That said, I only gave this product 3 stars. First, I think the material is kind of cheap. I feel like it will rip any day now and I've only had it for a month. Second it is kind of flimsy. My daughter kept knocking it over and moving it so I had to tie it to a cabinet. Now that I realize that the house is going to be out 24-7 I wish we had gotten something sturdier."
4,Playhut Beauty Boutique - Very Cute!!,"This was given as a gift to my 2 year old little girl. It is very cute! It doesn't take up to much room and you can always fold it up and tuck it away somewhere if need be. The only negative thing I have to say is that there is a little plastic pocket on the door, and it ripped off very easily. I think it was there so you could personalize the boutique with your childs name, not sure though. And there is a cardboard insert in the window and it becomes bent very easily. But for the price it is very cute and my little girl has had lots of fun with it."
3,Better if you store it flat,"The playhut is good for the price. I did find that it's sturdiness (squareness) seemed less with each attempt to fold it into a small circular form so I decided to store it flat against a wall instead. I would not get it unless you had a place to store it flat(36""W x 40""H)."
2,Get what you pay for,"This playhut is very cute. Although it was ordered for a Christmas gift it did not arrive until the end of January. When I received it, I was a little disappointed. The material is very flimsy, within a day, the netting on the windows has torn away from the top and I had to sew them back on. The bottom of the window (where the netting is located) tore right away after several play dates. All in all, I wish I would have gone for a more expensive playhut. It could be larger because my 3 year old wishes Mommy and Daddy could play in there with her. Her 9 year old brother and her make for a tight fit as well. I would purchase the more expensive tent or hut if you want a durable playtent."
4,My daughter loves it,"I got it for her birthday and she's been camping out and playing in it nonstop. It is light weight so it does get tossed around a bit but for the price, I'm not complaining."
5,Friend's daughters loved it,This was a gift for my friend's 2 daughters and they absolutely love playing pretend in this playhut. Cute theme too!
4,Great little shop,"Setup was very easy just pull and it pops out, taking it down is not that simple, very durable 3yr old loves it. Put a sheet on the floor and a few pillows and you will not hear from your child for hours."
1,The title says it all.,"I thought the Lupe Solano series had promise. But after reading two of Aguilera-Garcia's books, I decided that Lupe is materialistic and shallow and tiresome. I started getting annoyed by the constant references to her great looks, body, car, office, home, etc. Or the great looks, body, car, office, home, etc. of her boyfriends.The mystery was twisted but dull. If I can't like the protagonist, I'd at least like to be intrigued by the plot."
4,The most authentic portrayal of daily Cuban-American life.,"In ""Bloody Shame"", Carolina Garcia-Aguilera reveals the most accurate portrayal I've ever come across in fiction of the inner workings of the Cuban-American Miami psyche. Granted most Cuban-Americans in Miami are not P.I.s and are not as extravagantly wealthy as Lupe Solano. But when Lupe sits down and relishes her freshly made cafe con leche, or when she is harassed by her worried sisters for not having phoned home in the last 24 hours, the reader is introduced to the small things of daily life that make the Cuban-American culture unique."
5,Essential for those interested in Appalachian Studies,"The stories of Cratis Williams are essential for the getting a glimpse of Appalachia. He is/was indeed the leading spokesperson and scholar of life in the Applachian Mountains. These stories deal mostly with his childhood growing up in rural Eastern Kentucky. These stories are unforgettable and profound.Cratis Williams eventually came to Boone, North Carolina to teach school. He returned again after receiving his Ph.D. from New York University. Appalachian State University's graduate school is named for him.""The Cratis Williams Chronicles: I Come to Boone"" is another book that goes into detail about his coming to the high country of North Carolina. Highly Recommended.If you're at all interested in peeling back the stereotypical images of Appalachia and peering into a region with soul and character, give Cratis Williams a read."
4,GGXX,"The Guity Gear for PSO was great, easily the best fighting game I have ever played. With the arrival of this title on PS2 as Guilty gear X, I thought ""CANT be a better fighting game than this"", I am happy that I was wrong, this game ROCKS. The graphics are hi-res, the music inspires to fight (BEST OST I have ever heard) the control is awesome, and the gameplay is top-notch. All togheter makes a ""must buy"". I could rate it with a 9 (its what it deserves) but beacause I LOVE fighting games, this receives 10!Of course this is funnier with a friend than playing for yourself. Other thing that I REALLY LIKED was the Japanese language with English subtitles. I've ALWAYS dreamed the day I would knew a game of this kind.Believe me, you cant go wrong with this game.CDFL"
5,Very cool,"This game has the coolest style. The graphics are awsome and the characters are very different. fighting with weapons rules and the specials are neat. The sound rocks and it looks like one of those stylized fights you'd see in movies or cutscenes, but you are controlling them."
4,pretty good,"pretty fun with a lot of technical stuff to learn, only bad/good thing is how fast it is......VERY fast, so if you like crazy action like marvel vs capcom then you will probably like this, it is definitely not like street fighter 3 though so depends on your preference, has some cool crazy effects but not a ton of frames of animation (though each frame does look cool), a ton of stuff to unlock and a BRUTAL hard mission mode for people that want maximum replay/value"
2,do not buy if you are seeking recipes,"a very interesting history of the noble doughnut, with specific emphasis on the author's family's contributions, but not much if you are trying to find/explore doughnut recipes. The Ferroni book is where you should go for recipes and technique"
2,I was dissapointed . My fault.,I was expecting receipes not history. I chose wrong book..can you make them from cake mix? Are most made by deep frying?
2,Bits of Interesting Info but overall poor,Here is a book that I wanted to like... but I can't. Certainly there is somoe areas of the book that offer an interesting insight into the history of donut's but its written so poorly its hard to read. This book would have benefited by a good editor. I have picked this up 3 or 4 times since I purchased the book - its simply a bad read.
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would have more recipes in it that I could use. Well, it doesn't. It's a great coffee table book. It's lovely to look at and very informative. If you're looking for the history of donuts and something to read while munching on one, here ya go. If you're looking for a cook book - look elsewhere."
2,Buy a doughnut instead...,"I don't understand why everyone is so giggly about this book. I thought it would have many recepies and a ""how to"" make a great donut. The Food Channel has covered most of these donut places. I want to duplicate the kind of donuts found in these great donut places at HOME! Save your money and buy a dozen donuts instead."
2,Donut book,This book gave more of a history of the donut than it did receipes. Needs more easy donut receipes.
3,not what I thought,"Although this is a cute little book about the history of donuts, I guess I didn't read thoroughly enough. I thought it was a donut cookbook. There are a few recipes, but not many. It's more of a coffee table book."
1,should be called a donut history,"I purchased this book because amazon recomended it to go with the doughnut baking pan I purchased, however there are no recipes in this book for use with this pan. If you want a history and photos of doughnuts this is fine , but if you want baked doughnut recipes look elsewhere."
3,nice book BUT alittle disappointed,"I purchased ""The Donut Book"" online from Amazon.com Service and shipping was excellant! HOWEVER The book makes a nice ""coffee table book"" with lots of donut triva and photos BUT I was alittle disappointed, was expecting more of a ""cookbook"" with many more recipes and/or hints for making donuts!"
4,THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED,"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER, I got it for X-MAS and it is the best game I have, even now it is my favorite GBA game my friend wanted to borrow it (and he lives 250 miles away) the best thing is the graphics!!!!! I would give it a ten star but that is not an option."
2,Ummmmm.... and??????,This game at first seems fun. Then you find out that there are only two types of enemys that pop up every 10 steps. Then you just get bored and play this game mindlessly hoping it will end soon. This game will offer about seven hours of gameplay..... if you're willing to play that long.Sound 2/5I don't even remember the musicGraphics 3/5Nothing spectaculor.Gameplay 3/5The battles are too slow..... even on fast mode.(don't even try it on slow)Lifespan 0/5It just gets boring.Overall 2/5Not worth your money. Heed my warning.
4,Brilliant Western staire.,"Barton ties up film in a small but enjoyable package, Main is hilarious as is Lou. Another Bud and Lou winner."
5,Ouch!,This will get the job done. I do the exercises regularly and still wake up sore every morning. Hurts so good and you'll notice yourself looker leaner and standing taller.
4,Love it so far,"Let me just say that this is not my usual workout. I am an INSANITY and P90X graduate and love all of the beach body programs. However, on rest/stretch days or days where I want to pair something a little lower intensity, I turn to yoga and now Pilates. So far I have tried the ab workout in this box set and I love it. I actually had to take some breaks! As an experienced and frequent exerciser (if that's what you call it), I love this mat workout. Paired with another higher intensity workout like INSANITY and P90X it works great! My abs were really working. I would definitely recommend this!"
3,toasts slow,"Bought this for a gift. It works fine, but it is slow to make toast. Other than that it is great."
2,Very Slow for Toasting,"This Haier Toaster Oven does an adequate job baking and reheating small items, but is much to slow to satisfy me as a toaster. It usually takes at least 5 minutes to toast English Muffins or make Toast. Sorry I bought it."
2,Not impressed,"Not what I thought it would be, not impressed with the talent level - wouldn't recommend."
4,Worthwhile effort,"While not as good as Strangest Places and Everything Changed, you should definitely not pass up On The Way. On the Way starts with the elaborately pretty ""Into The Sunset."" ""Sugarite,"" ""On The Way,"" ""Take Care Of Me,"" and ""Birthday Song"" are first rate ballads. ""Sugarite"" has a slice of country and is really different for her. ""After All These Years"" is a mid-tempo song with a nice buildup. Abra's overlooked as a writer of good hooks, though, and this abum lacks a song like ""Big Sky."" ""I Believe"" is the closest, and it's a good song, but it's not as exhilarating as ""Big Sky."" The album gets a little dreary at the end part. But there are plenty of songs that make this well worth your money. And you can't get more un-sappily sensitive than the lyrics of ""Take Care Of Me."" Abra remains in-tune with life's travails."
5,Best CD Of 2007,"I just picked this up today. If I'd have heard it last year when it was released, I would have rated it the best cd released in 2007.Lyrically, this seems to be an extension of her wonderful previous cd, Everything Changed. Musically Abra adds some jazz flavor to her usual sound.It's a shame that more people aren't aware of her.Just great music & her best cd."
4,Into the Zone,"An excellent five issue compilation with beautiful artwork by Pacheco. And what FF fan doesn't love a story arc involving journeys into the negative zone (with the expected appearances of Annhilus, as well as the appearance of new, corporate foes)? Loeb's storytelling is solid, and we are even treated to a modern-day clash between the Human Torch and the Submariner. While Reed, Sue and Ben are trapped in the Zone, the Torch creates a temporary FF with members including She-Hulk, the original Ant-Man and even Subby himself. All in all, I found this to be a most enjoyable trade."
3,Worthwhile as an Anthology,"A useful anthology of mostly minor but (with some exceptions) undeservedly neglected Mozart. Recordings of these works are hard to find ""under one roof,"" so this issue has at least that advantage. Klien plays cleanly (pun intended), though not always with optimal charm. The sound is variable: warm and dry acoustics alternate distractingly. But the most serious deficiency is that there are no breaks between tracks, so that one piece in one style merges irritatingly into another piece in a totally different style. This should have been corrected--or did the producers not recognize the problem? Worthwhile for those seeking this repertoire in a bargain edition; but one can do better elsewhere (I remind my readers that Gieseking's classic EMI Mozart cycle, which includes the variations and shorter pieces, is still available)."
4,Hardcore baseball at its best!,"Where do I begin. This games has a real arcade feel to it. If you are a fan of NFL blitz games you will like it. Baseball is a slow game to most, so the makers of this game went out and added excitement to an already good game. When you slide into base you can take out the players and even hit or kick them. Sometimes they will drop the ball and you can advance a base. The characters are great and very real to life. Great fun."
1,"A frivilous book that simply repeated what had already been written in Continetti""s stories for the Weekly Standard","This book is essentially worthless. It provides absolutely no new information. Like the Peter H. Stone book, Heist, it basically repeats what the press had already written without any analysis or comprehension of what really went on. Just another herd-mentality book. Don't waste the money. Just read the news clips on Abramoff."
5,A real favorite of mine!,"I love this recording. Emma Kirkby's voice compensates for all other (slight) deficiencies. She is truly a great singer: vivacious, lively, energetic and lovely. Her tone is sweet and pure; it is as if this music was written for her. The other vocalists, with the exception of the Michael Chance (his voice is just not to my taste), shine almost as brightly. The instrumental soloists are delightful.Hickox is not a favorite conductor of mine, but on this one he hits it. And the recording is great. The violins are clear; often on recordings like this the instruments are buried or muddy. Here they are strong without overwhelming. Good balance, good sound, good material, and an extraordinary soloist surrounded by excellent ones. A delight from beginning to end. Don't miss it."
1,Woggle-Bug Book,The story it self is wonderful. The bad part is how it was edited. There are no pictures - but there are the captions to the pictures thrown in. It adds confusion to the read. You have to do your own editing as you read. This is distracting.
2,L frank baum favorite author from childhood,I enjoy many of the OZ books this was not one of the better ones but the Idea was fun. It would be great read out loud book. I miss the illustrations that you usually see. There are some glitches of repeated paragraphs which annoyed me. Some of them may have been a description of the picture that would be in the hard cover book. I would probably stick to any of Baum's story's in hard cover with original pictures.
5,A rare treasure,"The Paradox of Being is a rare treasure. Although I am not normally a fan of poetry, this book makes me want to be. Written straight from the heart, the poems in this book serve as a great catalyst for introspection and reflection. Dewey brings a unique intuition to his poetry and invites us to look deeper than what we are used to seeing and feeling."
5,Pathways to the Gods,I really enjoyed this book because it showed how much reseach goes into his books. it showed a different side to his work.
2,Pathways to the Gods,"It is very difficult for me to write a review about this book, as I very much wanted to like it. However, I must report that I believe Von Danniken reached his peak with ""Chariots of the Gods"" and has little more to offer in his forth-coming books.As a reader, I would like to see some growth in an author when they continue in a series based on their first book. Fresh insight, or new information, or more detail backing his theories would be the least I expect from this author. None of these things were present. Instead, one gets the impression of someone who is riding his own coat tails of the success of his first book. This book was disappointing on every level and I cannot recommend it as a buy."
5,On The Rocks Glasses,Crystal Glasses are exactly as advertised and pleasing to use.Good price/value compared to other choices.May have to buy more.
3,Thinned walled,"This set arrived today and frankly i was hoping for something with a bit more heft. They are each 14 and 1/4 ounces (weighed on a digital scale) which is a decent weight, but the walls of these crystal are too thin for my taste. I currently use high quality glass DOFs which have much thicker walls and are heavier and I actually prefer those to this set. However the transparency n reflecting properties of the crystal are beautiful."
3,Small Problem,"One of the glasses had a rough spot on the edge that was barely noticeable. Rather than try and send all 4 back, I just used a emory board and filed it smooth. It seemed to work. The glasses are not 25% lead crystal but have a nice ring to them and are heavy so I am satisfied. It is a 8oz glass which is a nice size."
5,"Sturdy, classic, and beautiful","Just bought these glasses for my husband's birthday and we are both very impressed. Each glass is very sturdy and heavy; feels very substantial in your hand. They are well made and look beautiful. I was searching around for scotch glasses, and these seemed to be the best ones in terms of quality and durability. A few other glasses I looked at had complaints that they were so fragile that the glasses broke upon washing. I highly doubt this will happen with these (knock on wood) as they are probably the sturdiest glasses that we own yet. Definitely recommend it!"
5,Crystal Beauty,Very classy-looking tumblers at a great price! Will purchase more when the need arises....hopefully they'll still be available. Love them!!
2,Good for older kids.,"This is called a toddler helmet, but my almost two year old daughter hates it because it falls in her face due to it being over-sized. I really don't understand how they can call it a toddler helmet if my very normal size daughter can't wear it. I reccomend you try on a helmet in the store...or try a search for a different brand. You won't want this one, unless your child is around 3 or 4. It's cute, but too big for a 1-2 year old."
5,Sturdy helmet,"Bell usually makes great helmets, so I trusted this would be a superb one. Appeared very sturdy with lots of cushion."
5,Kid's Bike Helmet,My 2 1/2 year old daughter and I picked out this helmet together. She loves it - kitty cats and pink. I love it because it covers her whole head perfectly and seems very safe!
1,Don't Bother!,"While doing the P90X I found that I was really enjoying Yoga days, anxious to do & learn more Yoga I purchased this set. The Vinyasa DVD takes forever to start, spending a really long time watching Rodney practice Yoga, when it finally does start the workout is so broken up into little bits that getting a good workout is a lost cause. The Power Yoga DVD is a little better, but the workout is so short it's hardly worth it. I briefly glanced at the third DVD and got so frustrated trying to find the actual workout segments I turned it off. Quite honestly Tony Horton may not be a Yoga Guru, but his Yoga workout leaves this sad set in the dust! I'm really sorry that I purchased it!"
5,Great Images,"The scenes and images in this novel are so vivid that they have stayed in my mind months after reading it-- pictures of a park in Athens, apartments, houses, cafes, the ocean. The story is of an ordinary life slipping almost unnoticed into extraordinary circumstances. There's an unobtrusive poetry in the writing and a keen sense of people as they are-- good and bad mixed together so that the same character is both admirable and wrong-headed at the same time."
5,"Very capably written, total engaging debut novel.","In Evening Would Find Me, Sylvia is a young American who flees to Greece to begin a new life after the heartfelt death of her mother. In Athens she meets a the painter Ari, and his beautiful, schizophrenic young wife Althea. Sylvia and Ari become lovers, and for Sylvia the affair engenders one revelation after another as she is drawn into a relationship with her lover's wife, whom she alternatively resents, loves, and attempts to protect. The three of them become irrevocably bound together in death and in life. Evening Would Find Me is a very capably written, totally engaging, debut title that fully documents Katie Estill as a major literary talent, and leaves her readers looking eagerly forward to her next novel!"
1,STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE,1950's mono sound transcribed to digital with agressive compression artifacts. VHS home video quality imagery. Yuk!
2,Disappointing,"Given all the hubbub surrounding this book, I found it quite disappointing. I admit that space opera is my favorite sub-genre, but I also enjoy the occasional ""little"" book, and really looked forward to reading this one."
4,Quick & easy service,I ordered this book I needed for a church book club. I found the lowest price and the quickest service. I have always counted on Amazon.
3,easy concept....,"I am not really interested in this sort of package, trying so hard to melt your heart, and also the music here are not chosen well...In this album, she sounds dull to me. Too much of beutifying the music through out and almost all sound the same after all. Also, sometimes her too much of vibrato gets irritating.I like her Tchaikovsky and Paganini, but not this one. She needs little bit more guts and edge or make it more straightforward. Otherwise this kind of easy concept won't work."
3,some ways to go in knowing sorrow...,"Sarah Chang is no doubt technically brilliant on her instrument, however, her playing lacks depth and consistency of style. In the piano piece by Lizt re-arranged for violin for example, she has great difficulties in transitions and is therefore subdued in her musicality. The orchestral interpretation/edition of Saint Saens piece on this album is awful. Similar recordings by Anne Sophie Mutter or Midori Goto show greater maturity and are much more pleasing to the ear."
3,Good,"The Vitali Chaccone was nice. However, I find her vibrato to be wide and wobbly at times. I purchased this CD only because I needed a recording of the Vitali. Personally, I don't enjoy artists (or their recording labels) compiling previously released recording and repackaging them, then charging a lot of money for it. I think I want to find a classic recording of the Chaccone."
3,Could be better,Good performance but does not induce the spirit of music. Needs more time. She has the potential.
4,Caution to the Wind,"Sarah is my favorite violinist and has been for years. I have most of her CD's. Her technical and emotional mastery is nothing short of miraculous for her age. But be aware that five of these pieces appear on two of her previous releases; ""Simply Sarah"" and ""Debut Recital""."
2,Cleaning Machine doesn't work twice,"Bought this item with excitement and anticipation of germ free environment in baths and kitchen! Worked great first time I used it. Second time I tried to use it, it did not even work. Called the number included with the product, got an automated answering device, left message and no one ever called me back. Ended up throwing it in the trash!"
2,Five Minutes of Fun,"My son just had to spend some birthday money on this and while I knew it was not the real thing, I let him give it a try. It was fun for about five minutes. You are not going to be able to scale buildings, or even climb a tree, with it. You could, however, put someone's eye out!"
2,White rope instead of black,"The rope was a different color than pictured and the box it came in was taped to h*** and back. I assume I got an item that has been used before and repackaged when I ordered something that was suppose to be ""new"""
4,seems good,"Well, I just got this 3 days after I ordered it which I liked. It came disassembled but easy put-together. The rope wasn't tied to it so I'm going to search how to tie a good knot. The rope is very small in diameter so I think im going to need to buy a bigger sized rope. Product was heavy and feels realistic and not some light piece item. Overall I'd rate it good but can be better"
3,"Twisting Adventure, perfect for the Science Fiction reader..",This book kept me reading most of the time but slows down in the middle- a little boring. Maybe not for me- but definitely for the adventurous Science Fiction type! Excellent otherwise!
4,Highly Enjoyable for the Age,"I remeber reading this book several times between my 6th and 7th grade years (I am now a Junior in College) and having enjoyed it immenslely. There are indeed parts that make you raise your eyebrow, however, most of these can be overriden by an examination of timeperiod and environment that Hughes has placed her main characters in.A good piece of Sci Fi for those who are interested in it in that age category."
3,Your Invitation to Invitation to the Game!,"What would you do if robots had all the jobs, and there was no place for you but in the ranks of unemployment? That is what happened to Lisse and her friends.Lisse and her friends have finished high school, but none of them can get a job. Then they are sent to a Designated Area for the permanently unemployed. The D.A. as it is called, is a dirty ghetto like area that is patrolled by the thought police, who makes sure no body get out of line. On the streets Lisse and her friends keep hearing little whispers about The Game. Then they receive an invitation, and start their amazing journey. For a while, The Game is an escape from reality, but soon, The Game could hold more then they can handle.Invitation to the Game is a good book for almost anybody. It is very good and keeps you at the edge of your seat. If you love science fiction books this is a must read."
5,Invitation to the Game,"Invitation to the Game was a great book, it kept me interested and it didn't make me bored. The author discribed the characters, the scene, the mood, everything very well. I didn't want to put it down, even though at times it could be kinda confusing by not telling you who was talking and bringing up points from earlier on in the book. The book is about a group of people who just graduated from Government School and are starting out a new life on their own, trying to get jobs. The problem is that the book is based in 2154 and so on, when most of the jobs are taken by robots. The friends discover something called The Game and spend almost all of their time trying to figure out what The Game is and how to get to it, what to do when they get there, and what the point of the whole thing is. They go through many problems but stick together to work through it. The book is very good and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,faboo!!!!,I read this book in 6th grade. I'm 17 now and still carry memories from it. I'm ordering it because I lost it and because it was such an influencial book during my formative years. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
4,A great story for a Horrible idea,"The idea of a bunch of unemployed people going into a game seems like the worst idea ever. When I first got this book, I read the back and immediatly thought I would hate it. However, I decided to read it and could hardly put the book down. The book had some sort of twist or turn everywhere you read that kept you reading the book. The characters are truly amazing and keep you reading the book. Monica Hues certainly made a great story for the bad idea she came up with. However, the end cuts off short and you dont get to hear about a lot of what you wanted to hear. If they make a sequal to this book, I will definantly read it."
2,Book is extremely unrealistic.,"I would have given this book 4 and a half stars if the content was more believable. Most of the time, Lisse and the other nine people who made up her close-knit group of friends were acting way too maturely for their age catergory. For example, when they ended up on Prize (their final resting place), they built a loom! How many people who are 16 can build a loom? And what about when they wanted to build a log cabin? How the hell did they learn how to build a log cabin? It's not exactly common knowledge.All of the above are reasons why I give this book only 2 stars."
3,Predictable yet refreshing,"I first picked up Invitation to the Game by Monica Hughes during my 1997 bicycle trip from Montreal to Toronto. A local museum was having a fund raising used book street sale, and I picked this book up for [a song]. It took me until now to actually pick it up and read it.While the book is quite fitting for early-teen readers, I might have been stretching it a bit at the age of 29, as I found the book quite predictable. On several occasions I wanted to grab hold of the characters and shake some sense in them. ""What are you thinking? Are you dense or what?"" Since I could not do this, I just had to suffer my way through twenty more pages before the characters caught up with the obvious.That being said, I did not realize the end of the book from the beginning, but only through the last 3 chapters. And apart from the last chapter, which was too sweet for my dentist to approve, the conclusion was quite refreshing for a children's book."
1,"Bad, then worse...the story when books are dumbed down","This book is so pathetically bad. My 8th grade English teacher brought it to the class and passed everybody a copy. Apparently the class would ""love"" this! It's so exciting! The ending! WOW! In this book everybody is so lamely resorseful. For example: ""Let's go fishing!"" ""Okay! Give me a stick and a lock of your hair!"" Then the two proceed to catch a whole motherload of fish! WHY, you might ask? BECAUSE, this book is so lame. It is dumbed down to a seemingly ""teenage"" level, and the ending is worse. Everybody finds love and gets pregnant. Gross. Implied sex, isn't that a little mature for the 8th grade? I think so."
3,"Uneven, unbalanced, and unconvincing.","Though readable, the book seemed unbalanced -- as if the author couldn't decide what to focus on: a fairly standard tale of a non-Utopian future, the mystery of ""the Game"", or a tale of survival on an alien world...."
1,this is a good book,i am 13 years old i just got into reading books this is one of the best books i have ever read .the girl just gets out of school and moves to a DA with all her freinds they hear about The GAME so they finnley she gets a notice that they should met and play the game its 178 pages and a great story for kids my age.
1,"""Hate"" is a strong word, but certainly appropriate here.","Your old ""Joy of Feather Dusters"" collection beginning to lose its appeal? Then this book is perfect for you! Stupid, unrealistic, and boring, the story will leave you enthralled... Before I sat down at my kitchen table and began reading it (as an assignment for school), I never realised how interesting a wall could be... I also believe the book to have therapeutic value. Insomniacs, here is your cure!"
1,How can anyone say this is good?,This is the worst book that I have ever read. The author uses very few feelings and images throughout the book. The book is very boring and so predictable. There are so many better books out there to read that don't have you falling asleep while reading them. If you want a good science fiction book read anything-but this book.
3,Not what I expected.,"The musical quality and singing on this CD are remarkable. However, the content was not expected. I had heard a song from this album at a conference -- hauntingly beautiful -- and I hoped for more of that on the album. But many of the songs have more of an upbeat, dance beat quality to them. Just not quite what I was looking for...."
1,question,Is this the Deluxe Edition? 'Cause it says somewhere that it has only 1 disc and the Deluxe Edition has 2...
2,screen guard,not entirely successful. the guard is thicker than what it replaced and often does not take the input of the stylus. I am considering purchasing a different screen protector
3,Read description carefully ~Great for outdoors,"This set is exactly what it says. Read it carefully though because they slipped in the word melamine and I didn't realize that means plastic. It's not the cheap plastic 4/$1.00 plates from the discount store, it's made more like the character children's plates they sell as sets. It's nice to have fancier casual plates, they looked great in my picnic basket!!! Just be sure your pfaltzgraff items say stoneware if that's what you want. I ended up keeping 2 sets then waiting for my stoneware ones to come down in price, now I have a service for 8 in both stoneware and melamine. This way at a party I can give the melamine ones to the children & they will match the rest. By the way, they say only top rack of the dishwasher safe, but the large plates don't fit on the top rack. I can't be bothered to hand wash them, so I put them on the bottom rack, and so far no problems."
2,I Did Not Review THIS Book,"I reviewed Bloom's 1999 Research Guide on Welty, not this 1986 Critical Views on Welty."
3,Worth a listen - if you can find it!,"This album is very hard to track down - indeed, many people will be unaware that it even exists. Written and produced after Nick Heyward left the band, the standard of musicianship remains as good as that on the Pelican West album, but unfortunately the songs just aren't as good, as catchy, as innocent, or as joyous. Marc Fox takes over singing duties and does a decent job, but he just doesn't have that bit extra that Nick Heyward brought to the show.Remember that this is all a comparison with the excellent Pelican West album, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. Paint and Paint is definitely worth a listen, and I'm very glad that I bought it, though it doesn't quite make up for the fact that the band split up - they were my first favourite band!"
4,Sunglass protective sleeve,"No color choice but I knew that ordering. They were exactly what I needed to carry my sunglasses. Hard cases that come with the glasses take way too much real estate in my small purses. The cases are silk on the outside, have light cushiony batting and lining. They will only protect from scratches not the possiblity of crushing."
2,Needs a Wizard,I think this book leaves a lot to be desired. The author seems to have been churning out the material without enough regard for the reader.
5,Amazing,"I started reading this book because my mother read it and told me I'd find it interesting. I thought it would be cheesy or boring. Was I wrong. This book changed my life, my perceptions, my way of looking at the world. Everything in my life is brighter than it was before. At first I was wary, but the way Deepak eases you into his timeless knowledge is wonderful. He doesn't force his ideas on you, but builds one idea on top of the other through the book, and you can really see the truth in his words. I am forever thankful that I stumbles on this work by Mr. Chopra."
3,"So, so","Love Chopra, but this one seemed to work too hard to tell the truth. I felt the effort opposed to the inspiration. As always good stuff, but he has better."
3,Pretty Good,"Bing a LoTR/Arthurian fan, I thought this book might be interesting. Basically, the author's theory is that humans can become like Q from Star Trek through sheer willpower. That's not possible. I know when I was a kid and saw ST: TNG for the first time, I wished I was a Q. I'm not one. That may eventually be possible through evolution, but that'll take thousands of years. He also says that wizards are beyond good & evil. That's misleading at best, cultlike at worst. No one on Earth is beyond good & evil, no matter how much we would like to be.While I don't agree with all of the author's ideas, there is wisdom to be found here. Also, if you want to read this as pure fiction, the prose is decently written."
4,another good book from Chopra,"Most people don't consider themselves creative. We seem to separate ourselves from the word creative, reserving it for musicians, poets, or other artists.But we have created everything in our lives and it is either beneficialor detrimental to us, only we can know.To create the life you want is really about increasing your satisfaction level. But we must first increase our awareness.What is the satisfaction level of your daily activities?To find your true wants and needs read, ""It's About You"" by E. S. Smith"
3,Typical New Age Chopra,"I was directed to this book by a series of sermons by a young preacher visiting our church. I have been reading the book slowly, as the author suggests, to let the message sink in. However, I haven't been struck with any major insights as a result of the reading. The message seems similar to that of other New Age writers. Nothing new here, IMHO."
3,"New-Agey, but good","The Way of The Wizard takes the reader through a 20 step program to induce a relaxed, aware state of being from which true magic can arise. The practices are equal to any sytem of meditation or yoga, and followed through to the end ""without lust of result"" (Crowley, not Chopra) will bring about the sate of being described. That being said, the book has the obvious flaw of New Age oversimplifation. THe natural paralells with the occult are watered down for the bourgoise audience. The use of Merlin is mythologically absurd. This is acceptable in the context of this work, however, since it is not intended as a tretis on Merlin. Rather, Merlin is used as an archetype of fulfillment and mastery of life. Recommended with reservations."
4,Romanticism or Satire,"This film certainly ranks highly as one of my all time favorite romantic stories. The pace is precise and builds a story that is quite involving and moving as well. The recent version is certainly presented in a much more captivating style in terms of cinematography. If you missed this film in the theatres, this is a must-have."
2,Better than nothing,"I bought this book because I was trying to troubleshoot a windshield wiper electrical problem. I have a 1985 Vanagon, however I found the electrical diagrams lacking. Although, this book covers 1982-1990 Transporters, there was only a single ""typical/representative"" diagram for all those years. Therefore, I did not have a specific 1985 electrical diagram which I needed. In my opinion this severely limits the usefulness of the electrical section. Since third party Repair manuals for Vanagons are hard to find, I am hopeful that the rest of this book will be more useful."
4,A decent repair book,"Having used Haynes books before, I find that this is a very good companion to the official factory manual. The photos show the relationship of the various components to each other. The only thing missing is a good diagnostic matrix. Not to worry though, what it has is well documented. Between the two manuals I can keep my VW running for as long as parts are avilable."
1,A POOR CHOICE,"The first thing I noticed out of the box about the large tumblers was that the summer breeze design does NOT go all the way around the circumference of the cup. Though the plastic material is thick enough to mimic glass on sight, the flaw in the design gives it a cheap appearance.Neither the large or small tumbler is designed to work well in the dishwasher. The bottom of the tumblers are concave, holding pools of water too deep to dry in the dishwasher. The worst defect is that, after about three washings, the summer breeze design begins to chip off of the larger tumbler. If hand washed, it might last longer, but why bother for this price?"
1,Cute but NOT DURABLE !!!,"Acrylic cups are somewhat faded looking compared to the dishes they are designed to match. Also, the pattern seems printed on the outside of the glass, bumping against other items in the top rack of the dishwasher has caused scrapes that damaged the pattern after ONLY 2 or 3 washings.I've never had an acrylic cup perform this poorly in such a short time. Surprised and disappointed."
2,Do not put in dishwasher...,"I liked the idea of having matching glass to go with my dishes that were acrylic because of kids. However, do not put them in the dishwasher, it causes the acrylic to crack and the design to wear off. It's too bad they didn't hold up better, they looked nice when I got them. Big disappointment."
2,Not impressed,"I love the pattern on these glasses, but it is already cracking. We have not even had them one month and they already look very worn because of the appearance of cracks. We will still use them for now, but we are disappointed for the price that we paid."
3,Hex- Key Set,"Great for working on the motorcycle. Not the greatest case, but the price is right. I use them and so far no problems. This is not for a pro that earns his or her living with them."
3,Strange Movie,It's a movie where the producer didn't know what type of film to make so he incorporated all of them. I liked it but I am one of the few people that enjoy strange movies. It's one of those movies you watch once for the experience but never put in again.
3,FAKE LOOKING MONSTER,"I enjoyed the movie, it was kinda funny. The characters were interesting so was the story, but the monster looked so very fake, very special effects."
2,absolutely SO SO !,"My daughter ( 8 years old) enjoyed this movie, me not. i think it could be better and the eating scenes by the monster more realistic , bad acting.just a kind of B movie !"
1,My review of this movie,"DON'T waste your money buying this movie new. Get it used, cuz more than likely you'll be getting it new anyway cuz the person that bought it, is trying to get rid of it. This has got to be the dumbest movie I've EVER seen, and that's saying a lot as I've seen quite a few! Crappy and cheap CGI, wayward and consistant off queue acting, and just plain bad...I will give the story it's props as it really did have a cool story line, but was just done ALL kinds of poorly. Please save yourself and just pretend this movie did't even come up on your list for movies to buy.Now please excuse me while I put a bullet through my brain so that I can try to erase the fact that I ever watched it, much less bought it!"
2,CMES Worthy,"Totally worthy of its stars. Juvenile, boring, as enigmatic as a tortise. Every aspect of plot comfortably plagarized. The blend of mythology, sex, and action as inspiring as a blend of T-shirt, flat, and water."
2,"Nice book for novice, bad for salted fishermen","If you go to the bookstore and flip through the pages quickly, you will find a lot of illustrations and interesting fishing words. Once you buy and read it at home, you reallize this book is the 'feature' type not for you. At least not for me and all my fishing buddies."
3,terrible recording,"The tunes on this cd are excellent. perhaps i've come to expect too much from blue note. i have coltrane's blue train, the sidewinder and infinity by lee morgan, and two blakey cd's that sound FAR superior to this one. i don't know what happened, but i was fooled by the RVG 20bit remastering mumbo jumbo, it's just too bad that this is the only version available..."
4,The Real Class,"Edward G. Robinson's versatility is on full display in his memorable comic performance as a gangster in search of ""class"" who is forced to hide out in a monastery. Plenty of great lines and wonderful character actors abound. Ralph Bellamy's bird-calling scene is priceless."
4,UNUSUAL BLEND,"A gangster film with a unique twist, this entertaining yarn has racketeer Edward G. seeking the finer things in life. Thrown out of his old mob, Robinson joins a monastery (!) to plot his next move. Offbeat, funny and improbable, BROTHER ORCHID is practically an outright spoof of thirties gangster flicks with Robinson broadly giving a caricature of himself as the title role (so named because he finds himself adept at raising orchids while hiding out at the secluded monastery; the name stuck after being affectionately named it by the fellow monks). Ann Sothern turns in a delightful performance as Eddie's ever-faithful floozy blonde girlfriend."
1,God 1 Mammon 0,This is aN excellent movie for those well acquainted with Holywood's pre-1960's 'moral stance.' It may at face value seem a little improbable that a gangster would seek refuge in a monastry but even post-World War II this seeming improbability of church sancity is based on solid fact [Nazis hidden in European monastries]. The inclusion of Edward G. and Ann Southern [always superb]gives the movie its good 'feel' and that is about the best that can be said for any movie. Excellent.
5,Brother Orchid-,"This is what I would call a CLASSIC BLACK & WHITE MOVIE Gangsta Comedy. It star EDWARD G. ROBINSON ( Old Gangsta aka Br. Orchid), HUMPHREY BOGART (As his 1st Lt.) who is running the business while Robinson is looking for ""CLASS"".The movie is in pretty good shape, none of that graininess in the film. I really like this movie."
3,Misses the mark,"This album contains a lot of orchestration and it mostly misses the country charm of The Lover's Waltz. Jay Ungar and Molly Mason's writing and musical skills of down home music seemed to be covered by these orchestrations. I'd like to have seen it done in the style of Lover's Waltz, which is an excellent album."
4,Good overall album,"I bought this album solely because I love the song ""Ashokan farewell"" from Ken Burns civil war documentary. However, there are many other tracks on here that will delight listeners as well. ""Thanksgiving waltz"" and ""Solstice Hymn"" are both beautiful pieces of music. There are some weaker moments towards the end of the album, and some of the quicker tempo songs are not to everybodys taste, but ""Harvest Home"" is a VERY solid album nonetheless."
4,nice,nice autumn music. peaceful and beautiful. i use it in my classroom while students are working - they like it too.
5,WONDERFUL BOOK!,"This book has the neatest ideas for adding a ""special touch"" to foods/gifts for special occasions as well as for those tough times in one's life. Very nicely done - I recommend this book highly!"
3,David Lanz Christmas,"Nice work; if you're a David Lanz fan or love improvisational piano you'll like this.... however, much of this is rehash from David's Christmas Eve album. Not much new here and especially at $15-$18 / at stores David could have done better."
5,Great MUsic,I have been looking for this CD for several years & was pleased to be able to finally get it. I already have Lanz's Christmas Eve cd so now I can have a little mini Christmas concert. LaAnz is a wonderful pianist/arranger.
5,Excellent!,Very happy with my purchase. David Lanz did not disappoint me. I love his style and the music on this album are great!!
4,Good example of David Lanz's work,"Great Christmas Album although I would have liked to have Lanz branch out and refine his musical voice. He, at times, is hard to differentiate from other players. He needs to make some less safe choices than these old standards."
4,Kids Exploring the World,This little book is a great introduction for kids to the things you would find Under a Log. These include all sorts of interesting bugs and animals. My 3 1/2 year old just loved it.
5,What a beautiful CD!,"This is one of the best CD of Chacksfield. Two wonderful LPs, specially the first one, you must feel sit at the Seine, earing the accordion music, enjoing the wine and looking the Eiffel tower.If you love the traditional French music, please, buy this CD!"
5,Mindblowing music!,"I have listened to many songs/music by Vanessa Mae but by far my favorite would have to be ""Storm""...This score has powerful bursts of emotion wrapped around an aura of unreality...Starting out slow, It explodes and captures the listener's attention throughout the song.. I recommend this cd to anyone who loves music."
2,this is mono,"I am just writing to warn that this is a mono recording. So if you are looking for a lovely sound this isnt for you. Playing it in a hi fi system will sound the same as in a portable CD player. Unfortunately I opened the CD and cant return it.Sound quality is really important for me, whether it is conducted by Karajan or even Mozart himself (oky I'll make an exsception on thay case!)I am sorry to offend more serious opera listeners who care about the libretto and drama etc.,.To me, the point of a recording is to bring the listener as close to the live experience as possible. Think about how that quality was in the first live performance in the 1700s! but I understand this was a 1950s recording befor stereo technology. But not my cup of tea."
2,Karajan at his best though unsatisfactory,"I can't understand why this is included in EMI's Greatest Recordings. Karajan is better here with Philharmonia under Walter Legge's direction than his DG days with Berliner Philharmoniker but he tends to run too fast and it is really bothering. Singers are doing well... especially Erich Kunz as Figaro, Sena Jurinac as Cherubino and Seefrid as Susanna are excellent. Elisabeth Schwartzkopf is very mature and graceful but still Lisa della Casa is more noble and shining as Countess in Kleiber recording. George London as Count Almaviva is not very sophisticated and a bit coarse. Tenor singer as Basilio/Don Kurzio is too lyrical for the comic character. Ensembles are not superb.To sum up, I don't agree to those Karajan manias who insist this is a must-have for Figaro."
3,A dated Figaro sans recitatives with vintage singing,"Secco recitatives are completely left out in this recording which is a pity as they are integral to dramatic continuity of the opera. What I particularly enjoyed was Erich Kunz's Figaro, a bluff genial portrayal which brought back fond memories of his Papageno in Die Zauberflote (a classic EMI recording also conducted by Karajan). Readers should also be aware that the Act 4 Basilio and Marcellina's arias have been ommitted."
2,Does not work with XP,"Make sure this is not the same DVD/DVD-ROM I purchased. It only works with Window 98 and not compatible with any other newer Window versions (Window 2000, XP etc) Tried to call their Tech Support Dept. (phone # on back cover) and got no help at all. Once my Window 98 dies, it is toally useless. Lee & Lee Communication should have offered some type of upgrade program or better tech support. But unfortuanely, there were none. So they deserve a ""2 stars"" rating."
3,Decent speakers,"I would compare these to most of the mediocre line of pioneer,Sony, Kenwood, etc, They are not as good quality as the older KLH, Many of which were Almost an audiiophile quality speaker. I recently sold these, They served me well but I regret that I overpaid for them."
3,"Shut up, you guiscard","This idiot guy guiscard who sounds like a British has written that Tigers of Mysore were crushed by the British. All I have to say is that there is only one thing which remains the same forever and this is History. History can never change. British could never have defeated Tipu Sultan because of their power. A British historian said few years after the death of Tipu Sultan, he said, that I have studied the histories of many kings and I have gone through a lot of historical accounts of different rulers of different times and I finally figured that in the history of world, no other king was betrayed as much as Tipu Sultan was. British defeated Tipu because of the betrayeld of his Muslim prime minister (Mir Sadiq) and Hindu Finance and Revenue Manager (Purniya).So shut up, you British.and one more thing, Hyder Ali inflicted a crushing defeat on the British in first mysore war for which British had to sue for peace."
4,"Showcase book, not much instruction",I suppose I didn't read the reviews closely enough but I was surprised that this was a showcase book. I was expecting some instruction but there is absolutely none -- at least not textually. That is not the fault of the author but I'm including this in my comment to clarify for other potential buyers. I am teaching myself design and am not at the level where I can learn just by looking at other examples. I am sure for those with formal design educations or with professional experience this book will hold much more inspiration.
2,This is NOT a tutorial,"If you are considering this book to learn the Photoshop techniques that would allow you to produce documents that appear multi-color but are printed with only one ink, I don't think this will be the book you want. It has a lot of lovely photos of such printed pieces, but other than tell you what software, paper and printing methods were used, there is no instruction in achieving similar results. I expected more of a training approach to teach you HOW to do it, not just show the results."
4,Green Goblin Year One,"Norman Osborn is back and he wants an heir to his name. Since his son Harry died trying to take over the mantle if the Green Goblin, Norman believes the heir apparent should be Peter Parker, also known as Spider-man! We also learn about the history of his love for his wife Emily, his abusive relationship with his father, and the new love of his life, Kolina. This essentially is an origin story of the Green Goblin. Too bad he forgets he had twin children with Gwen Stacy in Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 8: Sins Past story line. Anyway, back to the tpb, will Norman succeed in manipulating and convincing Spider-man to become the next Green Goblin by taking the Goblin serum? Buy the book and find out!"
2,"Might be a matter of high expectations, but disappointed.",I'm a medium-level solver and thought this collection was too easy and not incredibly funny (esp since there are funnier Times crosswords out there). I'm only halfway through the book and not particularly interested in finishing the rest. The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that perhaps Will saved the best for last.
4,More Punny than Funny,"These are all the puzzles that have puns or jokes in the solutions. Humorous, cute and amusing but not LOL funny. Once you start to get the joke it can make them easier to solve. Enjoyable!"
1,"Neither clever, nor funny.","I love Will Shortz and was really looking forward to this book, thinking that it would be chock full of clever clues like one of my favorites...a 5 letter word that means a button on an alley. Instead this is a book of crosswords that has puns and boring riddles/quotes/jokes within the answers. And a button on an alley? Reset!(For those unfamiliar with sedentary team sports, this refers to a bowling alley.) I wish I could find a book of clever crosswords!"
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"These crossword puzzles are, for the most part, easy to medium difficulty. The twist is that they're ""funny"". By funny, I mean kind of corny, but in a good way. People who are familiar with NY Times puzzles will recognize this type of puzzle: there's often a gimmick or particular style of pun that shows up in 3 or 4 large clues in the puzzle. They often show up in Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday puzzles.I can easily recommend this book, it's a great one to do on airplanes to stave off the grumpiness that most people feel while traveling. It also makes for a nice go-to book when you know you want a quicker or less difficult puzzle. A great gift, for yourself or someone else!"
4,Not exactly hilarious.....,"I got this book for a Christmas present and finished it fairly quickly. It was pleasant. The puzzles are a mixed lot of difficulty, mostly on the easier side. The ""funny"" part involves puns and wordplay and the humorous quotation format.Good for medium level solvers."
2,Not So Hot,"I didn't like these puzzles much. They had some amusement value, but my chief complaint was that they were too easy. Maybe even easier than the Monday New York Times puzzle."
2,A Pet Peeve,"I enjoy puzzles with a funny or punny theme, but many, many of these puzzles contain a pet peeve of mine. I much prefer that the longer theme answers be self-contained to give a decent chance of solving them; in this book, however, the theme answers are all part of a single quote, or even worse, a made-up quip. Half the fun of solving a themed puzzle is figuring out what the theme IS, then solving each clue. I would say about half of these puzzles have clues that consist of ""Quip, part 1"" or whatever. Boring!"
2,The cover is the funniest part of this book.,I did not find these puzzles either challenging or amusing - would have been better off just to buy a penny press book off the grocery store shelf.
3,It's a Puzzle for Sure,"These crossword puzzles are intriguing but I have to take exception to the title. Honestly, I fail to see what is ""funniest"" about them. But always fun, they do open up new ways of looking at a familiar word!"
4,"Not So Funny, But Fun","The New York Times crossword puzzles many times contain longer word answers that are answers to word plays or puns in the clues. The book claims to be full of ""side-spliting"" humor and while that may be a stretch, the puzzles are pretty challenging of the weekday variety. I got this at the bargain price of $3.98 and considering the actual daily paper costs a $1.50, this was a steal."
4,"I'm not sure about the ""funniest"" part","I guess they gave me a slight chuckle, but they are generally hardly drop dead funny. Regardless, they are moderately hard New York Times puzzles, on good paper, spiral bound for easy use. All in all, I'm glad I bought it."
2,I still smell like the pool!,"I swim five times per week. Even after using UltraSwim, I notice that my body (especially my hair) continues to smell like chlorine. In particular, even if I used UltraSwim, I notice a chemical ""chlorine"" smell when I sweat or get wet afterwards. The only thing that I have ever found that works for this problem is something called SwimSpray, which uses vitamin C. They have a website, www.swimspray.com, but I can't figure out how to order any.WIth UltraSwim, I have been showering at the pool and then again when I get home. Doing two showers with UltraSwim seems almost as effective as this SwimSpray stuff."
2,Covers very little ground,"Boyer does not cover any new ground in the college rankings hoopla. He reiterates common points that rankings opponents use to persuade readers. He also presents an inexcusable bias towards ""career-oriented"" majors by lauding the critical thinking skills that liberal arts majors exercise and pointing out flaws in the nature of specific career training. Furthermore, Boyer seems to only value 5 characteristics of a college that a student should look for; nevermind that every student in every major will not need every one of these characteristics in a college. Again, the author talks pointedly about things that a liberal arts major would want, not necessarily a what a music, or dance, or agricultural major would want in a college. This book is not worth buying."
3,Bought for personal reasons,"Han Suyin and my parents knew each other and attended school with my mom in Tianjin. In this book she mentions my great-grandfather, who is also known today, as the Belgian Mandarin, so I wanted to own a copy. My family always thought Han Suyin was a communist sympathizer but I don't know for sure if she indeed was or not. In her story, Love is a Many Splendid Thing, she makes out to have been intimidated into it by a colleague doctor at her clinic. Han Suyin was a Eurasian like my family."
1,Lemon?,I guess I got the only lemon? I bought the gun in 2004 and managed to put up hardiboard siding with it but had lots of feeding problems and the thing doesn't drive to a consistent depth. Building a garage now and am reliving all the problems. Tried different brands of nails with the same results. Have finally given up on it and I'm shopping for it's replacement now. Hope you have better luck than I did if you choose this gun.
5,Get this one,"Recently picked up this nailer. Had borrowed the older model from another carpenter friend and was about to invest in a bostitch for myself. Here's what made me decided this model was worth the extra $100+:- Easy to use, and it works. Never experienced a jamb with this model- Numbered depth dial so I know exactly where I stand at a glance. No dialing all the way down, then back out (as with bostitch)- Metal belt clip is low profile. I can actually hang it on my hammer loop and still have decent access to my hammer (bostich bulky plastic clip)- LighterI decided that after I had reached for this thing a few hundred times, I'd forget about the extra cash."
4,Outstanding,"I was really upset becuase suddenly, working out and a healthy diet were not enough any more to keep lean certain areas of my body. So I decided to try this type of massager and I bought it 3 years ago. I still use it, especially during Spring, to shape and get rid of excess fat I build up during the winter. It has worked for me: it really shapes and indeed I do loose inches. However, I am sure that I would not see results if I did not keep up with my excercises and good balanced meals."
3,Help me understand tension/speed strings,"New customer. Like machine but directions somewhat lacking. Which gives you the most vibration, 1 or 4 and black or green 1 to 4. Understand that both sides must be set on same number. It appears to me that the higher the number more vibration but not sure if green numbered side of dial has more vibration than black side with white numbers."
3,Schooling (horses) For Young Riders,"An account of the actual schooling of a ""green "" pony by a young rider complete with mistakes and successes. A good guide to training your horse or pony for children or adults."
5,well pleased,"Works fine, well pleased. Will be interested in how long it lasts. Most brushes only last one season or less, but this one seems sturdier. If so, it will have been worth the money."
1,"Crashes, hangs and slow!","My installation went without a problem. I can start laying out my house after watching the video tutorial. Everything went smoothly after a few rooms were layed out. Things start to become slow and non-responsive after that. I have a AMD 3500+ cpu, 1 gb of ram and nvidia 6800 gt card so I don't think it is my machine. The application will disappear in front of you from time to time (they are really thoughtful to provide an auto save 'feature'). When you re-open a plan you have worked for hours the other day, the program will spin with 97% cpu usage and refuse to open up your plan.Bottomline, if you want to design a room or two, buy this. If you want to create a house, forget it."
2,Not without recitatives,"Recitatives are essential for this Mozartian jewel. I can live with the mono sound, but I also want to dig deep into the essence of this magic flute. Although Fischer-Dieskau was sensational at that time, you are safer with Beecham's legendary recording."
2,Sound quality not of this time,"The performance is fine, as far as it is possible to judge it regarding the poor quality of the recording. It may have been fine in the previous century, but even remastering didn't bring in anywhere near today's standards: zero dynamics, very dull, and yes, mono! Unless you 'need' it for your collection, buy a more recent recording."
5,Wise and witty,"In a well-researched and thoughtful way the author explores those aspects of Christian belief that are difficult to accept on face value (like the virgin birth, the tendency to blame the Jews and excuse the Romans for the crucifixion, very different Christmas stories, and miracle stories) and peels away layers of theological presentations and pious fantasies to give us a glimpse of original worship and spirituality. Her writing is provocative and at the same time it is funny. I laughed out loud as I read sections of the book. If you are open to questions about Christianity and the development of religious beliefs you might enjoy this book very much."
1,P.S. Mr.Cole,How can I review this product.DO you not know that I NEVER RECEIVED IT.How am I supposed to rate it??????
2,Disappointing,"The main reason I bought this expensive book was to learn how to best program a tight-fitting Oriented Bounding Box, which is an essential component for real-time collision detection.This book doesn't provide any code on how to do this, and instead refers to a few vague places on the internet in terms of getting actual code. I can figure that out myself, obviously.The code that came with the CD is sparse at best, and didn't add anything I couldn't get on the internet already.Very disappointed, especially for the price I paid."
5,A must-have,"Even though I got this book from another source other than Amazon, I believe it's worth noting that this book is excellent. It is thorough from theory to implementation. It not only contains the theory necessary to implement your own libraries but also tips and secrets one learns by actually coding them --with the advantage the author hands them to us.Probably this one is to physics/collision detection asReal-Time Rendering, Third Editionis to rendering/computer graphics in general.The book is an excellent reference and I always have it close to me."
4,Excellent reference text!,"First and foremost a great book. The Author (Christer Ericson) is Director of Technology at SCEA and works on the God of War franchise - so he knows what he's talking about.The book covers all the relevant and required math for anyone interested in commercial game development. C++ and Object Oriented programming are used throughout.Chapters are logical and well structured, and the author keeps an up to date blog and website which includes code updates, errata or optimisations.Academia or anyone involved in computer science or real-time math should read this book!Great work Christer."
5,Geometry bible,"I wish I had this book 10 years ago (of course it wasn't written yet). For any numerical analyst that works with data, meshes and/or geometry, this book contains a comprehensive compilation of necessary tools.The presentation is comprehensible and thorough.I bought the book for the hierarchical search methods, and I am not disappointed. There are several chapters dedicated to various types of search trees, very well presented."
5,good!,"Cheap,right size and good fit. And the engine is still running! only if all auto parts were this easy to get!"
4,Fram ca5466 air filter,it's okay i guess. can't really tell the difference yet. the price is a bit higher than from walmart though (didn't find out walmart carries it until after i bought from here).
4,A good alternative,Save 50% on OEM price and buy the FRAM filter. Will it last as long as the OEM - that is how one measures the value. This is first time I am using a non OEM filter - so stay tuned!
2,"""Like New""----NOT!!!!!","It was listed as ""like new"". I thought it was well used and the cover was bent and discolored. Like new---NOT!!!"
3,Hot tubs,"Purchased for my savvy husband who is interested in building a steam room. He enjoyed the overall view of the book. It has a glossary, supplier list, and index, which I think is very nice. However, it did not give any book titles regarding this topic to go more in-depth in one of the discussed areas. The front cover states, 'for planning and designing your home health spa'. It seems that would be only for those who would hire it done. If one is truly interested in building a home spa, this a good background book, but you will need to look elsewhere if you truly want to build one."
3,Double Dream Sack,We have not used it as yet. The trip I bought it for was cancelled due to weather.It seemed like an excessive amount of money for what was essentially two queen sheets sown together. I know silk is expensive but still??
3,Let the buyer beware,"The movie itself is very good. Unfortunately, the film was made in French and dubbed in English. The quality of sound is poor. Such much so, that one cannot understand everything that is being said. I thought buying the DVD and using the subtitles in English would make the dialogue easier to follow. Not so. The subtitles do not match what is being said by the actors. They left out descriptions. They rephrase conversations completely. They botch up slang. They did a POOR job. It is amateurish and distracting. Good movie spoiled by shoddy translating."
3,Excellent Structure,"This was a perfectly constructed crime novel. It was not cluttered with too many characters, nor did it have portions that dragged because of over description. The characters were well delineated and believable. The writing of this piece deserves a 5 star rating, but there were way too many typos. I burst out laughing in the scene where Gibraltar has Louis and Louis knows Gibraltar is going to kill him. ""Thing Think!"" Louis tells himself. I knew it was supposed to be, ""Think! Think!"" But to have a mistake like that right at one of the most exciting points in the story is a huge distraction. And that was just one of way, way too many."
3,Dead of winter,"Good book. Good characters. A quick read with lots of mystery. Every time I thought I knew who the killer was, I'd realize I was wrong."
4,"Good story, Well written.","I liked this book. It kept me involved, interested, and guessing. The main character is well developed and very likeable, mainly because he's not the perfect cop. The story is good but what reallykept me reading was how the story was written, not so much the story itself. The book is not as good as some but is certainly better than many."
3,Dead of Winter,"Tense and well thought out plot, somewhat predictable. Overall entertaining. Characters were nicely developed and real in their weaknesses and faults. Would recommend."
4,Nice read,Would recommend this book. Nice flow. The story gives you multiple directions to follow. Really nice job by the author.
4,Awesomeread,Great story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Recommended for all who done it fans. Needs a sequel
2,Dead of winter,The f... word was used way to much and this really takes away from the storyline. Maybe it's a reflection of author's intelligence. Would not recommend.
3,Dead of winter frozen pages,"Not quite a thriller, this book tells an almost boring tale of a policeman killed in his own home by who dunnit.There is no action, just a slow type of story that will keep you interested until the end arrives. It arrives very suddenlyand your'e not quite sure what happened."
4,Kept my interest.,Quick easy read. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more Louis Kincaid books in the future. Good book.
4,First time reading these authors,"My first time to read these authors, I understand they are sisters, very interesting. Good book didn't want the storyto end."
3,Kindle version demonstrates importance of quality editing,"This is a fast paced and interesting story which I would likely have given a 4 star rating had the book been edited with much more care than is evident in the Kindle version. The mistakes were numerous and often serious to the point of distraction. The reading experience was a bit like riding through a scenic vista on a road full of potholes. The ending, I felt, was especially jagged. I have no issue with the outcome itself, but rather, the presentation of the outcome. Bottom line, I don't regret spending the time on this book and I'll give the series another chance."
2,Kind of boring,It wasn't a terrible story just not that interesting. I was never on the edge of my seat. For a thriller it was pretty timid. I will not be reading anymore of the Louis Kincaid stories.
4,Good read!,Hadn't read this author before but enjoyed this book! Will read more P.J. Parrish in the future as this seems to be a series.
4,Recommended! Easy read!,Good book. Story line kept moving along. Godd plot twists! I was surprised of the typos in the book though. Someone forgot to proof read!!
4,close to home,I enjoyed the read. Louis Kincade is believable and approachable. I'm looking forward to following him to his next assignment.
4,Good read,Even though I knew who the bad guy was early on-I couldn't put it down. Just had to see what was coming next. Enjoyed this book and will read more of his books.
3,Dead of Winter,QuiQuick read. I like that !Good plot. Good action. GgGood detailllsddetails. I will read more about Louis...he was an empty character with plenty of promise. I was surprised the authors were 2 sisters! :)
4,Good read,Louis kept me turning the pages late every night. Looking forward to more thrillers with Louis Kincaid . Thanks for the read.
4,DEAD OF WINTER,"A very interesting mystery. As you were reading, you got caught up in the personalities of the police squad that Louis Kincaid joined. I really enjoyed the suspense and the story. It certainly made you think of the difficulties that our police force faces, and the laws and balances that must be followed."
4,Very Good,"I just finished this one and pretty much agree with what others have said. Its a well written ""who dunnit"". The characters are well developed and feel alive. The setting is superbly done. I only found two negatives... for me was it just felt a little too long. Around 75% in I started getting restless with it. The book also left me feeling down, its not an uplifting ending by any meaans at all."
3,Ended as I thought,"I didn't really like the main character, Louis, at first. He actually grew on me about half way through the story. The chief was so mean that I figured out pretty quick that the chip on his shoulder was for good reason. The situation with Zoe felt like it was originated to give the chief good reason to act like he did. By the end, I actually liked Louis & felt like I would like to read where another book would take him. I'm kind of glad though that the other characters wouldn't be going with him, wherever he goes. I enjoyed the story enough to finish it and will look to see if Louis moves on. In all fairness, I have read a lot of mysteries within the past year, so maybe they just have to really stand out to keep me in suspence."
5,A New Light,"The Black Sox scandal is what first sparked my interest in baseball and baseball history. I grew up loving Shoeless Joe Jackson and the 1919 White Sox. I considered myself to be quite knowledgeable on the subject. After reading ""Red Legs and Black Sox"" my view point on the event changed. Most of my beliefs stayed the same, but I began to see things in a new light. I always like to be able to hear both sides of an argument. This book certainly presents Cincinnati's point of view, one that I have never been exposed to before. While the mystery isn't solved, new evidence is brought to light.This book has reignited my interest in this exciting chapter of baseball history."
2,Little to recommend it,"A book by Hall of Famer Edd Roush's granddaughter should provide some insight into his career and the 1919 World Series, but it delivers neither. It isn't a good biography (precious little is said about Roush's post-1919 career), and its Black Sox material is a disorganized non-story. I give it two stars for providing some basic material about Roush's early days in professional baseball, but that's about it."
5,Best Afro-Cuban percussion text out there.,"So you already have a fairly good understanding about how to play your drums and now you want to learn some Afro-Cuban rhythms? This is the book for you.The author clearly goes over the parts for clave, palitos, cowbell, bombos, bongos, congas, timbales, guiro, maracas and shekere for many traditional songs: Danzon, Son, Cha-cha, Mambo, Guaracha, Bolero, Conga, Mozambique, Rumba, Guaguanco, Abakwa, Bemebe, Songo, Merengue, Plena, Bomba, Calypso and more. Scores are provided that include parts for bass, piano, horn and guitar and other strings. There is also an extensive section for the drum set with these songs. It is the best book I have seen so far for learning these songs.2CDs included with short demonstrations of above."
5,Excellent reference and study book,"If you're looking for reference or study books for afro-cuban percussion, Ed's book is very good. It contains rhythm scores for several important instruments such as congas, timables, bells, bombo, guiro, clave and pailitos, as well as scores for many different song styles for these instruments. Styles include son, son montuno, bolero, yambu, guaguanco, columbia, guiro, abakua, mozambique, songo, bombo, and calypso. Ed also includes many hand exercises that are worthwhile, I'm a guitarist of many years, and learning hand independence and percussion rhythms and rudiments has been invaluable for me. I practice on congas, cowbells, claves, drum sticks (pailitos) and bass drum several times a week, and regulary use this book as reference for different songstyles. There is of course much more to the book (and of course no one can include everything) but for what I use it for I consider it a great reference book from a very talented teacher."
5,"An essential guide to Afro-Cuban Percussion and Drum set playing, and more!","An absolute wealth of information on Afro-Cuban percussion, this book is encyclopedic in its content and very effective in delivering examples of rhythms, grooves and variations. A must have for any serious student of Afro-Cuban percussion, buy this book."
3,The Emporer has no clothes?,"Look, I'll be blunt. I'm far from a jazz authority--though I've been listening to it for roughly 10 years now--but in my humble opinion (as evidenced by this record, anyway), Jimmy Smith just does not know how to play a slow ballad. The super-frenetic, scattershot method makes your jaw drop on numbers like ""Indiana"" and of course, ""The Champ,"" but his over-aggresive flourishes on ""Lover Man"" and ""Body and Soul,"" to name just two, fly *completely* against the mood of their respective songs! Maybe because it's an early record, but I hear very little subtlety or grace in the playing here...both of which can be just as important as fire and velocity."
4,The cutest martial arts flick!,"This is another one I remember watching on the big screen. Once again, it's been dubbed into Cantonese (from Mandarin), but they didn't do a very complete job of it, so sometimes a line or two will pop out in Mandarin, which can be entertaining in itself, if you understand the language. Plot- and character-wise, this movie is the best! All the actors (pint-size and regular-size) do a wonderful job of showing how much fun childhood can be. The kiddie fight scenes are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Jet Li was perfectly cast as a kid caught between childhood and manhood, and he showcases his talents with great fight scenes as well as with tender moments between his character and his brothers and between his character and Hwang Chou Yin's. Filmed on location, this movie also showcases some of the best of China's spectacular scenery. Great entertainment for all ages!"
2,cantonese not mandarin,"I have seen this movie before and it is originally in Mandarin. I wanted this movie to show my Chinese students about Chinese culture. However, I was very dissapointed to find that the copy I purchased is in Cantonese. The dvd is pretty much worthless to me now."
3,Interesting scenes,"Lots of cute scenes, including when all the boy actors have to bend over for a caning."
5,A great movie with shaolin kung fu and wu tang sword!,Its one of the best jet lee movies ive seen yet
5,A Literacy Pioneer,"All reading specialists should be familiar with the work of literacy pioneer Grace Fernald, and reading this book is a good way to do so. Fascinating. One of her students and later collaborators was Helen Keller."
5,Published Reviews,"""Rich in allusions to the scholarly context and well annotated, this book is recommended for graduate students."" --Choice""Drawing on an impressive array of recent theoretical writing about sociology, history, and psychoanalysis, and a wide range of hermeneutical technologies, Ash's study of Conrad's psychosical dilemmas attempts to show how Conrad as an individual responds in his writings to the historical processes and socio-psychological crises engendered by industrialism, imperialism, and the political tensions, latent and manifest, of Edwardian society...Ambitious, original and engaging."" --English Literature in Transition"
2,Miriam,"""~No doubt an eloquent voice of silken and then brilliant metallic quality. No one can argue that.""~ voice like this is not fully employed when the repertoire is so monochromatic."
5,How will she ever top it?,"The lead singer of Adiemus... after this CD, she may never go back. Although I enjoy Adiemus' sound, this work far exceeds it in both beauty and sophistication.The selection of songs is outstanding. If Peter Gabriel had realized how impressive her rendition of ""Mercy Street"" was going to be I doubt that he would have given permission to use it ;-) Miriam wrote or cowrote 9 of the cuts... this is also impressive. Perhaps the best accomplishment was the merging of the voice with the mood of the pieces (as in ""Song of the Seahorse"").Occasionally, Miriam slips into the nasal presentation of Adiemus', which should be avoided in future works, but it takes very little from the work. Should be in everyone's collection."
5,Categorise this at our peril.,"Sometimes you have to take a chance when buying albums. The vocalist with Adiemus, she also sung on Mike Oldfield's Millenium Bell. This is a very beautiful album, full of great songs and with lots of different influences, including those from her native South Africa. She has a stunning voice and is backed by a talented group of musicians and singers.My favourite track is ARCADIA - rich vocals, lovely orchestration and, for me, a typical New Age vocal. However, would the album be categorised as New Age, MOR, Rock - or should we not bother to pidgeon-hole? Wherever we put Miriam, it's a brilliant album and if you like it, you will be pleased that her follow up album - Second Nature - has been released in other countries besides Japan."
5,Great singer / songwriter,"I first heard Miriam Stockley while at work listening to a New Age internet radio station. Her voice instantly mesmerized me so naturally I did a search on her name and learned about her music. I ordered both CD's, Miriam and Second Nature, and I was pleased to find that I really enjoy almost every song on both CD's. Even the ones that are not my favorites are ok. Miriam has a beautiful voice and these albums seem to have a South African flavor to them which I find unique. I highly recommend both for your listening pleasure."
4,Amazing Voice.....Curious Mix of Sounds,"This woman has one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. From the moment I first heard ""Forever My Heart"" I knew I had to have this CD. Don't buy this CD if you expect more of the same because the rest of the songs are nothing like it, or for that matter, like anything you'll hear anywhere else. While I wish there were a couple more songs like Forever on the CD, the rest are gems in their own respect. Its now one of my favorite work CDs because it is all great music without demanding or monopolizing your senses. Great background music. I like it more and more each time I listen."
5,Magnifique!,"Let me begin by denying any rumours that Ms. Stockley paid me handsomely to write this review. Surpassing Loreena McKennitt and easily matching Lisa Gerrard, Miriam blazes a bright star with her voice. She can be a boys' choir, a gospel singer, Barbara Streisand, and so on. In fact, this is the only person who has ever done a Peter Gabriel cover song (""Mercy Street"" in this case) and far from insulting has actually transformed it. Not as many tribal songs as I'd have liked, but those are nearly as perfect as the song ""Adiemus."" Right now I'm simply enjoying the fact that nobody else in town knows about this gem. By the way, I'll bet Amazon.com wishes I was getting paid to write this, so I could buy more from them."
3,Children's sermons,This book is ok. I was looking for talks to give to children in front of the congregation. these are too involved and require more involvement than can be done in 3 minutes. These are better suited to class room.
5,Great for Children's Church.,"Very clear instructions using everyday objects to show Gospel truths.52 Lessons - one for each week, and some showing science in action."
1,Worthless Covers,"I got enticed into buying these covers by their price $0.37. I knew there was some catch and it was the shipping cost $4 or 5 that they charged me.It would still have been ok if the quality was any good. But the cover was torn the very first day of usage. It does fit well on the remote but is very cheap and will not last (even a week). I dont recommend it to anyone. Buy a quality cover if you need at all. ( I did not know that Wii remotes come with covers when you buy them, otherwise would have never ordered these). Stay away!!"
2,Not worth $1...,The covers look nice but the one for the nunchuck is loose and does not fit well. Also if you put the one on the Wii remote itself and then turn it sideways (to play games like Super Mario Bros) the cover is so thick that you have a really hard time pressing the buttons...I want my money back.
4,Difficult to do,Our family worked on this during the holidays. The picture was great but difficult to do...not for a novice. Only those family members with stamina continued to work on this.
2,WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL,"I agree with other reviewers in that the author went to great length to research and report all the details, and I mean ALL the details. It is indeed a tragic story, but very difficult reading at times. Mr. Hudson's use of all the initials (SSRI, SLED, DJJ) got rather frustrating at times, because maybe I couldn't remember 100 pages and two days later what SSRI stood for, and to go back and try and find the explanation was a bit too much to ask. I have not yet finished the book - Christopher has just spent his first night free - so I'm still not sure how it ends. I don't really remember the case - maybe because I was on Zoloft and couldn't function right. Sarcasm? You betcha! I do understand that everyone reacts differently, but Zoloft was a life-saver for me and thousands of others as well. The other thing I noticed - and this was Pinnacle, not Mr. Hudson, was all the typographical errors. Unbelievable."
5,Works Great and Left No Residue,"Purchased this item to lubricate my new Grex Tritium airbrush. Has made the action smoother and did not leave any residue in the paint. The odor makes me think it may be mostly a corn oil product, but I am happy with results after two months of use."
1,TCP Global Failed To Deliver,In stock when ordered and after a week I wrote to find out when it will ship only to be told its out of stock. But according to TCP should be in stock this week but no sure they are now believable.
5,Noxious just gets better and better!,"Noxious Emotion has come a looooooong way, especially in their last 2 releases. ""Elements"" however, is the first disc where I have liked every single track. The keyboards and melodies are so much richer than on previous releases and the rhythms make just about every song club friendly. If you already like Noxious, you'll LOVE this one. If you don't have any, this DEFINATELY the one to start with!"
4,The Transverse Flute at Its Most Suave and Gracious,"Many Baroque music afficionados may remember Scheibe as the author of an infamously vicious diatribe against the music of J. S. Bach ( e.g.: ""If only his writing were not so turgid, so convoluted!""). Scheibe's own talents, though obviously nowhere near as stellar as his target, are nonetheless considerable. The two flute concerti on this wonderful recording are seductively and sensitively rendered by artists Maria Bania and Irene Spranger. The musical lines of the inner slow movements are gorgeous and the outer movements are captivatingly playful.The concerto by little-known Johan Joachim Agrell is delightful as well, and the one by Johann Adolph Hasse is a real surprise, because it is far less dramatic and more affecting than might be supposed, given the composer's vast output of Neopolitan opera."
5,Great!,These slippers are amazing! I got them for my boyfriend and he wears them whenever he is in the house!
4,nice hat for the price!,"had been looking for a plain cadet cap for something different to wear other that a regular baseball hat....found these and ordered an olive one, liked it so much I also ordered one in gray..nice hat for a reasonable price...they both were delivered in a couple of days after I ordered them....."
5,Great look.,This cap is so cute....put it on and fell in love. Nice color of grey. Can fit many head sizes. Looking for army green now as this short style peak good for me.
1,"Love the hat, hate the service","Although the hat smells like chemicals, its adorable (and hey, I suppose I know for sure it's new right?) I will certainly order more colors of this hat, but I will look for another seller. My hat was over a week late and when I got the box it looked like megatron and his transformer friends had played football with my package; while I can't fault the seller for what the postal service does I CAN absolutely fault them for their piss poor service. When I kindly and concisely asked for a status on my week late package, the following is the response I received: ""Hello. Please contact amazon/fba team. They handled your order and will have information."" REALLY? Could you at least pretend to be sorry or care? Got it, it's a straight forward situation and not ""your problem"" ehats, but your manner of handling customers and the impression it leaves is 110% your problem. I am not impressed."
3,Barbeque Bucket & Mop,"It is packaged nicely but it is a bit pricey for the quality. I would have thought that the bucket would be bigger. It is nice that there is an insert in the bucket that can be removed and cleaned separately. The price warranted a ""few bucket inserts"" to justify the price. The picture of the item makes the mop appear larger than it is. If I had seen it in a retail store, I probably would have not purchased it."
4,This book grows on kids.,"Every time a kid picks up P.B. Bear's Treasure Hunt, they are sure to find something new. My daughter has enjoyed this book throughout her childhood -- it has lasted through non-reading and reading years."
4,A Very Good Album,"Not destined to be a classic, but a great example of Tom Harrell's writing and arranging skills for big band. Reminds me a lot of Thad Jones-Mel Lewis type of charts they would play. I find the whole album very refreshing and enjoyable. A lot of orchestral colors and writing concepts employed."
4,Tom Harrell's splendid big band and writing,"In an interview not too long ago with Freddie Hubbard on a jazz radio station in Long Beach, Freddie remarked that he doesn't listen to much of the young lion's work these days but that he thinks Tom Harrell's band is the best he's listened to ""and He's White"". Don't know what to think of Hub's statement but one thing is sure after listening to this album: Tom Harrell is happen'ng!! His writing and arranging outside of his playing is excellent throughout and even the old standard ""Dream"" is given a great arrangement. Also outside of Tom's great playing, other musicians shine as well such as Alex Blake and Don Braeden on tenors, and Xavier Davis on piano. Like Freddie, if I ever go to New York City, I'll definitely see this great band!!!"
5,A wonderful storytelling adventure for levels 1-3,"The eternal fan favorite... this adventure began as one of the most popular RPGA adventures, and finally saw the light of day in this beautifully illustrated edition. The nefarious panther lord Rahib has plans for Grey Mountain, and your intrepid adventurers seem to have incurred his wrath. And when the beautiful Princess Rahasia is kidnapped, the DM's glee (and players' dramatic misfortune) knows no bounds... a wonderful adventure for levels 1-3, easily converted to AD&D."
5,Great for learning the basics,"If you really love to cook, learn how and why you do the steps in what order. These books have good pictures and if you learn methods for making bread, those methods also work for making rolls, and other specialty loaves. You can learn how to plan for the nutritional needs for children at different stages, how to plan a meal for 10 or a party, and how to plan what groceries you will need for a month. Original editions included diagrams showing different cuts for different animals."
1,Picture is deceiving,"The picture looks like this adaptor will fit the jars also sold. That is not the case. The picture is not the item you get. The actual item is a much smaller lid that actually fits the paint bottles, so eliminates the need for the jars."
4,"Great story, hard to put down","Richard Russo's characters are realistic and draw you in to the story immeadiately. Though the story description describes a relationship between a son and his estranged parents, this story is more about a son and his father. I guarantee you'll feel guilty about loving Sam Hall by the end of this novel. What a great story. I cannot recommend it enough!"
5,A Real View of America,"I love Richard Russo's books, because I think they show a realistic view of some of America's ordinary people. Of all his books, I believe the Risk Pool is the BEST!!! I agree with another reviewer, I didn't feel so much as I was READING this book, as sitting in a bar and observing it!!! Please give us more books like this Richard Russo!"
4,The Best,"Already read it, could not put it down. Ordered another of his books. Highly recommend! Would love to see a movie made of this one."
3,"Good, but not as good...","After reading ""Empire Falls,"" I had to get my hands on some more Russo. ""The Risk Pool"" chronicles the life of Ned Hall and his relationship with his deadbeat father. Like ""Empire Falls,"" I became engrossed in the town of Mohawk and the characters. There seems to be somewhat more of a poignant maturing of the protagonist vs. what develops in ""Falls."" This sadness of the narrator becomes more complex and empty as he becomes an adult; something we can all relate to. His younger descriptions are mostly observations, but as the book progresses, we see how these observations affect him and leave him reflecting. While not as riveting as ""Falls,"" ""Risk Pool"" definitely is another good read by Russo. I only wish he had titled it ""Fourth of July, Mohawk Fair, Eat the Bird, and Winter."""
4,"very good, read everything this man has written!","I almost abandoned this book in the early chapters because the father was so shiftless and sorry. I'm glad I stayed with it. By the end of the book I really cared about him even though I can't approve of his lifestyle or child-rearing methods. Russo causes us to have understanding and sympathy for his characters; I never thought I could care about a group of characters who spend most of their time hanging out in bars. This book is very good and worth reading, but I still liked Straight Man much more."
4,Russo is great writer,Keeps you engaged - and connected to all the characters in the story.Even his early books are good - and he only gets better with eachbook he puts out. Great story....
4,The risk pool,"I must say I really enjoy Richard Russo's writing! He has moved right up next to two of my other most favorite authors, Anne Tyler and Dennis Lehane. This book was a definite 4.5 stars for me. I already miss the characters and am a bit sad that I won't be able to follow what is going on in their lives any more. Now which one of his books should I read next?"
5,A big story in the all the best ways. Loved it.,"After the slim tragedy of Mohawk, Richard Russo really exploded with Risk Pool. This is a long, satisfying, involved book covering the length of a relationship between father and son. It's populated by Russo's typical denim-collar roustabouts and academic escapees--a population with whom I doubt I'll ever tire.Personally I'm a huge fan of this kind of large, quasi-Dickensian fiction. It creates a world you can enter and enjoy for longer than just the day or three it takes to read most novels these days. This is more poignant than either Nobody's Fool or Straight Man, but I think it carries its weight/drama very well. And it left my wife in tears, so it's definitely got the power to grip you emotionally. I can't recommend highly enough."
2,Over Written,"I am currently trying, and I mean really trying to read The Risk Pool by Russo but am very bogged down at about one third of the way through the book and I just wish the protagonist would get on with it and grow up - i.e. not in the sense that he is immature but that I wish he wouldgraduate so we can see what happens to him if and when he reaches adulthood - given how over written this book is - I sometimes thinkwe never will. I usually very much like Richard Russo's prose but this novel is an exemption and I mean that in a bad way. On the other hand I just loved Straight Man, A Novel which I also purchased for my Kindle on Amazon.com."
2,Too much focus on negative...,"I was SO excited to get this book. Finally something out there to speak to me. But once it arrived and I started it, I was completely disappointed. I am pretty hefty and it seems to speak to women two and three times my size. I don't understand. I'm overweight and I was told it would be hard for me to get pregnant, still trying BTW, and this book speaks to women much bigger than me?Bottom line, if you are very obese then this book may be EXACTLY what you are looking for. If you are only slightly obese then apparently the regular pregnancy books are more in line with what you are looking for.Good luck."
2,Not very helpful,"I had high hopes for this book, as I am 4 months pregnant with my first child.It seems like it's mostly re-assuring you that ""big is beautiful"" and retelling horror stories of being discriminated against because of size, with very little actual information. There are descriptions of medical tests, but this is mostly a self-esteem book, not a very helpful guide for pregnancy."
1,"Terrible, Awful, Very Bad","If I could give this book zero stars I certainly would. The writing is terrible and the editing is no better. Dates and timeframes do not match up, names get confused, etc. The beginning few pages should have been enough to make me put down the book for good, but I needed some fiction about Inanna for a class so I tried to stick with it. It was awful. If you want some interesting representations of Inanna try 'Snow Crash' by Neal Stephenson, but please don't buy this book. I don't even want to take it to the used bookstore, but would rather throw it in the trash. No one should have to suffer through it."
1,Inanna of Tiamat--a poor rendering,"This book is based on the ideas of Zecharia Sitchin which do make for an interesting read. This story however lacks plot, is very poor on character development and is childishly written. The reader is much better served by the original Sumerian poetry and traditional sci-fi. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,"enchanting story, exceptional writing, I wanted more","I have been intereseted in the subject of prehistory for years, but have never found until this book a comprehensive story of the facts behind the myths of creation and or celestial visitors and genetic tampering. I also was enlightened about the origins of the war between the sexes - it's strictly rivalry. This book answers so many questions that I may have to take a few weeks to sort out my thoughts. I just want to say it is a must read book for anyone interested in Chariots of the Gods and 12th Planet. It is more and better than those books that supply the facts. This book sorts out the story and is surprising. It's enjoyable and I will have to read it again, once to get the story, a second time to fully understand the dynamics of the history. I recommend it to anyone interested in the Zachria Sitchin Earth Chronicles series. A great read!"
5,"My search is over, I have found Inanna & her world","The answers to my facination with the goddess Inanna lie in this book. I had to read it for a class, but I began to find that I adored the story by the first page. It seems that Inanna has that captivating and enchanting effect on others. This book is charmed and charming. Read it yourself. It opens up a wrinkle in time. I can't say enough for it."
1,Poor quality,I guess you get what you pay for.Water gets into the dial very easy and it's about 5 degrees off.
1,Not a good product.,"Very poor. It is nowhere close to an instant reading, it takes over 25 seconds to get the temperature to rise.Mine strains to go over 140 degrees even when another thermometer will quickly (and accurately) check the proper degree.Cheap, and does not function well. Buyer beware. Spend even twice as much, and be done with it."
4,Bud Rides Again,"Nothing here has the fluidity and dexterity of Powell's earlier recordings, but the intensity is high nonetheless, and the sound quality is flawless, giving it something the earlier recordings don't have.Buster Rides Again, the album's opener, is one of the greatest cuts I have ever heard. The mid-tempo afro-latin groove pushes Powell to playing explosive rhythmic tone clusters, and the energy between Philly Joe Jones and Powell is uncanny. The problem is, after an inventive opener like this, the up-tempo bop pieces are bound to be a bit of a let-down. In any case, worth checking out. Excellent piano trio work."
3,Excellent film but shouldn't be compared,"I completely enjoyed this film, even with some of the historical inaccuracies in regards to Newton's conversion. It was easy to get into the story, and feel for it's characters.That said, this movie should not be confused with or compared to the other film of similar title "" Amazing Grace "". First of all, it is about two different men. John Newton was impacted by his experience in the slave trade. Amazing Grace is about William Wilberforce, who was impacted partly by John Newton. Wilberforce was never IN the slave trade, but was dramatically opposed to it. He spent decades of his life putting an end to it in Britain, with the inspiration of Newtons experience.So, please don't confuse the two films.The Amazing Grace is heartwarming, but not to be taken as complete fact. If one keeps that in mind, it is a wonderful film."
1,"Bad History, Bad Acting, Bad Movie","This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen. From beginning to end, it was a travesty to history. The only truth to this movie was there was a slave trader who wrote the now famous hymn, Amazing Grace. From there the movie engages in historic fantasy. It credits the tune to African origin when, in fact, Newton's words were put to a multitude of tunes. It wasn't until about 1835 when the words were married to the tune ""New Britain"" which we now associate them. Newton's conversion experience didn't occur through the love of a captured slave, but rather after a shipwreck and reading a summary of ""The Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas a' Kempis. The cast was a crew of clumsy amateurs and the dialog was as stilted as any you'd hear in a high school play. On the whole, it was one of the worst movies in recent memory."
5,One of the best business books ever written.,"This book belongs on every business owner's bookshelf -- not at the other end of the house, but right at hand. Currently ignored, it will likely re-emerge as a classic, perhaps ranking close to The Prince.Hypesters need not read it. Business people who think should read it, re-read it, and refer to it. Cynical and fair, mercenary and humane, realistic and pessimistic and mostly optimistic, it is one of the finest business books of this century."
5,the finest business book i have ever read,"whenever i have had a tough problem in my 17 year businesscareer, i pick up ""up the organization"" and lo and behold,there's the answer. it has been my business bible andit is amazing how it never gets outdated. i am thankfuli chanced on to this book early in my career."
5,Crystal clear job!!!!,"I am quite impressed with the clarity of this set and everything seems perfect except for one thing. It's ""Dobey"" not ""Dobie"" on the inside pictures!!! They need to learn to spell!!!!!"
5,Historical cop show FANATIC!!!,Love Starsky&Hutch as soon as the movie comes I will buy it.But I wish they had CHIP's on DvD Please make it happen.
5,"S&H a Great Show and also""CHiPs""","Dear Ritchard J. Sieruga, if you do not like ""CHiPs"" it does not mean that it is bad. I like Starsky & Hutch but I also love ""CHiPs"" and I think it is one of the best Police Shows of the 70's and 80's and I think many people out there think the same way.Please release all seasons of ""CHiPs"" as soon as possible plus the rest of the seasons of Starsky & Hutch.Thanks."
5,Love 'em!!!,"I grew up watching Starsky & Hutch and since they do not play episodes on cable anymore, I am thrilled to have this DVD pack. Will continue to enjoy for years. Love 'em! :-) So glad I found on Amazon.com."
4,great show; dvd packaging could be better,"Having bought and watched all of Season One, I was looking forward to getting Season Two, and working my way through the episodes.Although I'm thrilled to be able to enjoy all of STARSKY & HUTCH from the second season, I'm a bit disappointed at the quality of the second season boxed set, especially compared with the first season. There are typos and misspellings all over the place (including, as someone noted, Captain Dobey's name!), the episodes seem to be in some random order rather than in the order in which they were aired, and there are scenes missing!When I order a dvd set, I expect better than this. I hope Seasons Three and Four come out, eventually, but I'd rather wait a little longer for better quality than have another rush job like this."
2,dent puller,This item is useless. Tried it once-no suction as it is made very badly and went straight in the trash.
2,great to have if you want to have a red plastic thing in your shop!,if you want to use it to pull dents get something else. this would probably work if you have a really thin door panel with no crease in the dent. otherwise it's just a red handled plastic doodad that makes a plop sound when you stick it to your car and pull it away.
1,cheap quality,low quality product would not trust it to hold onto anything of value cannot recommend this product to anyone at all.
1,Can I give this no stars?,"This is the most worthless tool I have ever purchased. Sad really...we can't seem to find a solution for what to do with the world's trash, yet companies are allowed to sell items like this that literally aren't worth returning so they hit the trash within minutes of the package being opened. I had a large dent that had a nice flat surface and I couldn't get enough suction with this thing to even create a pop. I cleaned the area and then added water to no avail. I could detach it with one finger due to the lack of suction. Save your time, money and the earth by letting the Bondo company figure out how to dispose of this piece of trash."
3,Bondo 954 Suction Cup Dent Puller,"I would not use this again, I may have used this for the wrong size dent, it will not harm the paint surface. I gave three stars because it is not great but not bad for its purpose."
1,Cheap Plastic Toy,"This is NOT a framing gun. I don't why the great reviews. We build for a living, and would not want this on the job site. We have two Porter Cable FR350A's and a Bostitch F21PL. We use them to hit boards into place when it's too difficult to grab our hammers. You'd never do that with this light duty gun.This gun seems to have average power. It's definitely not the ""most powerful nailer in its class"".On a separate note, holding 300 nails isn't actually as beneficial as it seems either for a framer. The magazine gets in the way a lot, and the coils are very fragile too. You can always keep extra nails in your belt.As for value, I think it ranks poor. Porter Cable and Bostitch are your best value. I highly recommend the Bostitch F21PL- it can nail anything. Even wood into masonry, and joist hangers.If you like Makita, get their MAC5200 compressor or their lithium-ion tools. They're great."
3,Many of the features in this description are NOT included in this version,"I have this ""standard edition"" of Corel Photo Album 6 and it does NOT include the Web Gallery, ANY batch processing, or the option to automatically resize your pictures when emailing them.There are probably many other features that are missing.It's good software if you don't mind the missing components.This Amazon description is for the DELUXE version."
1,Not a TEAC,"I paid a little more hoping for a better drive. Got an off brand (not a TEAC). The drive doesn't work either (surprise, surprise). The first clue is the plain white box and the instruction manual, neither of which have any brand name whatsoever on them. Just ""USB Floppy Disk Drive."" And, for comic relief, they sent it to me ""Media Mail"" (ripping off the postal service and getting it to me just a little bit slower . . .)"
4,external floppy drive,The external floppy drive simply plugged into the computer and was recognized by the computer and ready to use. It has been very useful in reading files saved on floppy disks on an older computer.
2,TEAC FD_05PUB USB Floppy Drive,I am using a Lenovo ThinkPad W510 with Windows XP service pack 3. When I plugged the drive into the USB port the computer would recognize the drive but I was not able to read any of my data disks. I received an error that the disks needed to be formatted.
1,BUYER BEWARE: These are NOT TEAC drives,"I bought three of these drives, through Amazon website and supplied by a third party vendor, SHOPDIGI.When my order arrived, I compared them to the TEAC drive I was replacing and became suspicious. I then spent 20 minutes on the phone with TEAC America who confirmed that these drives are absolutely not TEAC brand drives. The product looks like an authentic TEAC floppy drive, the Amazon website states that it is a TEAC drive, however it is not.I attempted to contact AMAZON about carrying and/or advertising a counterfeit product through their website. The Amazon representative, in some other part of the world, did not seem to understand the problem.SHOPDIGI did refund my money including shipping, however they are still selling these as TEAC when they are not."
4,External USB Floppy Disk Drive,"When I first received this item I was not sure it would do the job or hold up. But so far it has worked excellent. I did have fears that this was not a Teac product as no where on it is it labeled. And I did not receive an answer to my inquiry back.It is small, compact and is very easy to use and store. I would recommend this to everyone. I have really enjoyed knowing I could see all my old flobby disks again. I thought my poetry was lost forever."
3,"its about sun spots, its not about sunspots","Ill keep this short. I'm a fan of italian horror and giallo's but this movie had me scratching my head. It had a poor plot, very confusing and left me a little unsatisfied. The movie showed me it had something to do with sun spots then sun spots had nothing to do with it. Like another person said its a murder mystery wrapped in an Italian giallo. The trailers, both american and international, totally make you think its gonna be a good horror. But I give it three b/c I collect a lot of italian and euro horror. Plus I've seen worse."
5,Classic Cartoon TV Series From The 60's,The complete set of cartoon shorts from the 1960's that I used to watch in New York on WPIX TV. Inept detectives somehow manage to outsmart equally incompetent crooks. Very witty characterizations and stories. Really glad this was so well preserved and made available on CD.
4,The Dick Tracy Show!,I'm in my mid-50's. The last time I saw this show was when I was a kid back in the Bronx. It brought back so many memories. I laughed bigtime with the classic Tracy characters to include the intro theme. This DVD set I think may have every episode ever made!
2,Too Long Ago,"This was a nostalgia buy ~ I remember loving these as a kid, and when I read details about the product I would not have appreciated back then ~ such as Everett Sloan was the voice of Tracy ~ I had to get it. Fortunately I found a ""fell off the truck"" copy on eBay for less than half price, because upon playing the first disc I realized that these are pretty much for kids only. Aside from a few adult references (such as using a Peter Lorre-like voice for Flattop) these are not very clever, and definitely do not hold up as adult entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. I guess I was fooled by my own enjoyment of many great reprints of the original Tracy strip (which I see is now coming out in new editions ~ look elsewhere on Amazon) but after 3 of these cartoons I knew I was going to be trading this one in at Coconuts. Better stick to Volume 4 of Looney Tunes, which appears to have quite a few ESSENTIAL Bugs Bunny features this time."
5,It Works,"Great Product.It is not noticeable, works, and is very cost effective. I work as a waiter, while leaning forward the bottom of my tie does still move, but not enough to be of concern. The only draw back could be that it is not adjustable, as in how high or low it secures the tie (or if your tie loop on the back ripped out).Its better than a tie bar/clip because it does not slip off, twist, or fall off completely. It is also less flashy than a tie bar and there is no need to match colors, metal tones with watches.Would definitely buy again and give as a gift."
4,Tiedown; tie tack alternative,"Not a bad idea @ all. Works better with longer ties, but am overall very pleased with product. Don't know why I didn't think of this."
5,Tiedown,"Tiedown, the Alternative to Tie Tacks and Tie BarsI generally use a tie chain, I dont like the holes left in my silk ties by tacks, and ties these days seem too wide for a tie bar to grasp completely.Some years ago, my wife gave me one of these tiedowns, and I've since ordered more.Thoroughly satisfied with the product. Keeps tie straight and no need to fool with tacks or bars."
2,great idea but.....,I love the idea but the product does not hold up..... the plastic broke after a couple of uses.... I am going to come up with a modified version using items from my local craft store....
3,"Ok, but.....",".....why not just make one yourself? You can find various things made of clear flexible plastic, probably laying around your house right now. Cut a strip 1"" by 5"" then cut slits at the proper places for the shirt buttons to go through. Other things would probably work, too. Off the top of my head, how about a small rubber band?"
2,Extremely awkward when you bow/bend your posture,"OK it works as it is advertised, BUT (A HUGE BUT) when you, for instance, sit on your chair and bow/bend while you are writing something or simply looking at your computer, your tie will appear cracked from the point where you attach this thing. Believe me, its extremely awkward. The reason I gave 2 stars is because it does what it says, only when your posture is almost 90 degrees straight, which is something quite impossible to maintain all day long.Also considering what you pay for the shipping, it is better you don't buy it."
4,Tiedown,"This was a fantastic idea! The only letdown is when you have shirts, where the buttons are hidden (Fly), other than that they work well. My ties stay in place, and they can't be seen."
5,This is a great item,I use it in conjunction with a tie chain because I used to lose them all of the time. Still use the one that I ordered 6 months ago.
5,buy it,"these work great, stay behind the scenes and last longer than expected. not a big fan on metal tie clips/tacks/bars or don't want to pay for one then these are perfect"
5,a 'desert island' 'keeper',This is a `desert island' CD. One of the most pretty bits which I have ever heard [second only to my very favorite [virginal]. CD.] One could not ask for a better match of music a MELLOW harpsichord. Exquisite playing.The printed notes are dandy and the engineering and recording first rate. A `keeper'.
3,Not As Good As Some People Say,"I read some reviews for A Cadaver Christmas that made it seem like this is some kind of new classic. It isn't. Not even close. It's a zombie comedy that doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's not near as funny as some other zombie comedies, such as Zombieland or Zombie Strippers. It's not a bad movie, mind you. It's just average, and average isn't good enough."
2,No reviews before watching...hmmmmm,I wanted to like this movie but Damn it Jim I can not. I liked the sound track but this movie is boring. There are a few scenes and a few lines that are funny and that is it (the funniest lines are in the closing credits). It's not worth sitting through the whole movie even if you're having a B-movie party night. You can find something more entertaining.
1,Horrible Zomedy Grindhouse attempt,"I attempted to watch this horrible movie. I always go into a movie looking for something new and budget forgiving. Acting was atrocious, comedy was too dry and late, storyline, well----nope! No attempt at a believable set. Don't waste your money on this flop!"
4,energetic fun,"i watched a cadaver christmas earlier today. quite an entertaining movie. energetic, funny, and smartly aware of the tropes it satirizes. the three leads are hysterical, and i laughed out loud early and often. a modest zombie outbreak occurs on the campus of a small college, and it's up to the janitor, deposed police officer, and town drunk to solve the crisis. this delightful flick also contains a pretty graphic and funny necrophilia sequence. great camera work, also. the movie wisely scuffs up the print, a la grindhouse, to give the movie a seventies look, which, to me gives it instant cred and weight. highly recommended."
5,Fun campy B-horror,"Saw this movie locally, really enjoyed it and would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a fun goofy horror movie."
5,Soft ball that flies straight,"This is a nice ball. It is soft and flies true (i.e. it goes where I miss hit the ball) or it flies as intended when I hit it well. Unlike some of the cheap balls this doesn't have some of the general curve in the shot related to a slighlty uneven ball. SInce I got this at a very nice discount well worth the price.The ball also isn't over glossed like cheaper balls which creates a sliding affect on the shoe whn hitting the ball. That usually goes away with some play, but nice to not need to work in that ball as much."
3,Not as good as the TV series.,"Richard Carpenter's Robin of Sherwood TV series (aired under the title ""Robin Hood"" in the US) is one of the best filmed versions of the legend ever. Many of Carpenter's ideas -- most notably the Arab Merry Man -- have been borrowed by later filmmakers. Unfortunately, his series of books are really just juvenile novelizations of the TV series. They don't add anything to the shows, and I think Carpenter's writing works best on the screen. Still, if you can't get the episodes on video, this book will give you a taste of the TV series that Robin Hood historians call one of the most influential 20th century versions of the legend."
3,Decent Card Overall,The fights with Chael Sonnen vs Anderson Silva and Tito Ortiz vs Forrest Griffin were good enough alone to make this dvd worth buying. The whole fight card itself though is just average when compared to all the rest of the UFC events.
1,He's soft in the belly!,"11 fights, 8 decisions, 3 finishes all coming from body blows. Really not much variety on this one, just some hugging and light punches with some ribs and asst internal organs failing miserably on the side."
2,Now go get your shine box Chael....,"It was revenge for the Nogueira brothers carrot comment, and a lot of other things. And there wasn't nothin that we could do about it. Anderson Silva was a made man and Chael Sonnen wasn't. And we had to sit still and take it. It was among the Brazilians. It was real greaseball stuff.He even kneed Chael in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.Gotta wonder about Chael sometimes...he may fold under questioning."
4,"Good fit, better design than OEM","Installed the Dayco tensioner on my commuter car (2000 Mercury Sable) with 195,788 miles. Worthy of note: make sure that your other pulleys are removed first, i.e. idler and power steering, or they will impede install. The Dayco design is much improved over OEM, especially in the adjustment bolt area--there is more surface area."
2,"Georgia, How Could You?","I've loved Georgia Brown since the '60s, and pre-ordered this CD. What a disappointment! The cuts from ""Porgy and Bess"" are rocked up when they should be moody, and the rest of the music is haphazardly put together, making the CD difficult to enjoy. Georgia sounds better than ever, but whoever created the arrangements should be punished!"
3,For Karloff Fans Only,If you love Boris as I do then this set is worth your time and money. It is nowhere near on a level with the Twilight Zone or it's offshoots such as Outer Limits but Boris is Boris and what more needs to be said?
2,The Dull Veil,"Before buying this DVD set, I wondered why it was never a series. When I watched it, I know why. Most of the tales are predictable and dull. The only redeeming value is that Boris Karloff is the host and in most of the stories. This would be good to rent--but not buy."
3,Well-mounted versions of often-hokey scripts,"This package, which may take the place of the earlier Something Weird offer, uses similarly pristine copies of the filmed television series, which apparently wasn't picked up on either side of the Atlantic (though at least three cobbled versions of the episodes have been circulated as anthology movies THE VEIL, DESTINATION NIGHTMARE, and JACK THE RIPPER over the years). As with ONE STEP BEYOND, the stories are pointlessly offered as true accounts, or at least being based on true accounts, which results mostly, I suspect, from their being based on folktales (one is clearly a version of ""The Vanishing Hitchhiker,"" for example). But Karloff is more than game, as others have noted in reviews of the SW set; this series isn't nearly as good as THRILLER at its best, but a reasonably-priced set will probably not disappoint fans of anthology horror and suspense series nor of Karloff."
3,Always good to see Karloff in anything,"It was ok, but, Thriller is the one by Karloff, that is the better of the two. Karloff is the King of Horror, so it get a pass."
1,it is terrible!,earphone does work from the very begining. And the mouse just lost the left button function after two weeks. Just a disaster.
1,"WORSE ITEM I EVER PAID FOR!!! THE ITEMS WAS USED, THE MOUSE DOESNT WORKS... REALLY BAD DEAL","EXTREMLY LOW QUALITY ITEM, MINE WAS PURSHASE AS A BRAND NEW ITEM AND REALLY GIVE YOU A FAVOR NEVER CONSIDER THIS ITEM FOR PURCHASING."
5,Lincoln rocks w/ purpose!!!,"Rarely do I get a CD in which I love ALL the songs. This is an exceptional one!!!Never having heard of Lincoln prior to his concert at my church, Saddleback in Lake Forest CA, I took a risk in picking up this CD (signed copy at that) after his performance, and boy - it was well worth it. It's as if I'm still in the concert each time I pop the CD in my car. HE TRULY ROCKS W/ PURPOSE AND IT'S ALL GLORIFYING GOD!"
4,Great Worship,"I had not heard of Lincoln Brewster before, however, our church is using some of his worship songs. This CD is very nice, especially the last five songs. The first songs are upbeat and the last songs seem to enter you into worship."
3,"Good, But. . . . .","Great songs and solid playing. But like so much music today its had the snot compressed out of it in mastering. I find overly compressed music fatiguing to listen to. (I'm referring to audio compression here not data compression.)Other than that, its a solid record. And the extras are nice too!"
4,Slightly bland recording of great music,"I think that The Purcell Quartet was slightly ""at sea"" in this repertoire. They even used the 18th century a' = 415 Hz pitch instead of the much more authentic, and necessary, a' = 466 Hz Kornettton/Chorton pitch. When you're dealing with period strings and scordatura such subtlties are important!I have listened to this set again and again and find the whole approach of this recording a little ""un-engaged"". It strikes me that the Purcell Quartet is not at home in the realm of Biber or Schmelzer. They haven't ventured into this repertoire since, so maybe I am right?There are probably better recordings of the Harmonia artificiosa-ariosa out there, but this one is okay if you are just looking for a pleasant and uninvolved interpretation.Sorry to all the fans of this recording!"
2,They Aren't the Dukes and It's Not the Bobcats,"This is not the original and legitimate Dukes of Dixieland but the group that acquired their name. Although it's a pretty good CD, it's not exclusively from the Bob Crosby Bobcats chart. I have most of the Bobcats' recordings, but ""Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen"" is not among them and some of the arrangements are quite different from the original l935-42 recordings. Oh well, you get what you pay for and l5 cents plus shipping is acceptable, although disappointing."
5,Smart deck!,"I just wanted to say that this deck is my favorite of all. I have had other decks, but this one has a pull. It also has, over time, become very intune with me. I can now tell someone I'm reading for the stop shuffling - I don't even have to touch the cards to know where the top card should be. Two nights ago I did a reading after not having picked up the deck in months. I did not have to shuffle. It's like the deck knew what my next question would be and it was prepared in advance. Very accurate deck, very interesting, and makes me feel like I know the spirits well. Also, if you have this deck wrap it in a cloth like it suggests. That's when my deck got really good. P.S. be careful what cloth. My deck hated white!"
1,Uninspiring performance,"This is an uninspiring performance with Karajan. Worst, the title role is mis-cast, for Hildegard Behrens has neither the voice or allure for Salome. The other singers are adequate, but no more. A recording to avoid."
3,No table of contents?,"Just got this book and so far I feel like I am learning a lot. But it is in onvenoent, to say the least, that there is no table of contents How come?"
5,This book causes addictive habits,"I got this book for Christmas a year ago and have been hooked on fermentation ever since. It has really opened up a whole new world for me. This book is about making food, preserving food, starting a new hobby, micro-farming (perfect for the city!), and having a better understanding of the world around us.I recommend buying this book before Katz's other book, The Art of Fermentation. The latter is much broader and doesn't step you through things in any detail. This book will give you a grounding in the basics of fermentation and provides many great recipes for beginners. Once you're addicted get the other book and prepare to be overwhelmed by the possibilities of fermentation. =)"
3,book,This book was so call one of he best on fermentation. It is not what I thought it would be. there is a lot of info but thought there would be a little more on fermented veggies.
3,Good Book,"Liked the book and the information, would have liked more recipes but well worth the read. Not a book I now refer to with expantion of fementation experiences. But well worth the novice to read and understand. Yes if you are interested in wild fermentation I would recommend you read this book."
5,Excellent book,This book is full of useful information on all types of fermentation and a lot of excellent recipes too. A great addition to my library.
2,Some good recipes - too much off topic,"I find the recipes and general information on fermentation potentially helpful - it's good to have it collected in one volume even though there's not much here that is original or unique in terms of the book's stated topic. And the useful content is buried among a lot of off topic text that is distracting at best and offensive in some cases. While the author is (and should be) free to live in a gay commune with his transvestite friends and anti-religious bigots (and his beliefs and behaviors should not be banned, regulated, or persecuted), I have no interest in that and I find it inappropriate in a cooking book. I'll be returning the book."
5,Good product,"A great book to have in your kitchen. It is also a good read, but it depends on what the person likes reading."
1,Not for conservative cooks,"I purchased this book because I have Nourishing Traditions and Sally Fallon wrote the foreward. I was also impressed with the good reviews. But this book really ruined my appetite. The author feels it necessary to use the F word to express himself. I might have been able to stomach this in order to get my money's worth, had there been good recipes in addition to those in Nourishing Traditions. There aren't in my opinion. Unless you like crude language and descriptions of decomposing bodies in your cookbooks, say ""No, thank you"" to this one."
5,Excellent Book,"A truly excellent book on fermentation.It compiles, explains health reasons, steps in the process, reasons, etc. for using fermentation of food. ""The"" definitive book on the subject.Some people have trouble dealing with the author's honesty, lifestyle, philosophy, friends, etc., of this ""autobiographical cook book"", but I found the author to be extremely knowledgeable on the subject of fermentation. Perhaps these people should not buy this book, and wait until someone comes along, (if that should ever happen), that meets with their religious belief systems, AND is knowledgeable on fermentation."
4,"Informative, practical, useful.","This book did exactly what I wanted it to do, teach me how to prepare fermented foods. Some of the other reviews are overly concerned about the author's lifestyle, I didn't really care about his lifestyle so I guess I didn't notice the references and thus didn't obsess over them. I don't think he goes out of the way to do anything other than to discuss the perceived benefits and preparations of several fermented edibles in ways which are easy for the layman to understand. My kraut turned out great and that is all I really care about, next up is Kim chi."
3,good but... to be found elsewhere too,"i'd say all the fermentation recipes are to be found in sally fallons book ""nourishing tradition"" + the cookery and all. a much more complete book for the money."
3,Neutral,"It's not exactly what I thought it was, which was a more thorough explanation of how/why fermented foods are good for you and how they impact your health.There are a fair number of recipes for various fermenting projects, but it read to me more like a philosophical discussion by the author.It's not bad for what it is, but just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Learned my lesson,"Well I learned my lesson in making sure in the future to read all of the negative reviews as well. I only read the one about not including enough meat recipes. The ""Wild"" part of the book is definitely his lifestyle. I was very excited to get the book and then very disappointed in the content inside regarding the ""community"" in which he lives and the goings on. There was too much of his views on his lifestyle and I could have done with none of that lets just get to the fermentation info. I wouldn't buy nor recommend this book just write down some recipes from a book at the library if I were to do it again."
1,Too Wild for Me,"I tried just blacking out all the offensive passages but there were so many! In the end I just got rid of it.It didn't really have any more information than there is in ""Nourishing Traditions"" anyway.I do find it interesting that I reviewed this when I got it and my negative review was taken down."
2,A little disappointing...,"As soon as you open this, you get problems. First of all, the man who wrote this book is a vegan, and does not include any fermentation on meat. Good luck living in the wild without a concentrated source of energy and nutrients. We run yet again into problems where much of the fermentation isn't even wild, in particular for dairy. I understand dairy isn't usually available in the wild, but the book is about wild fermentation, right? If you want to learn about fermentation of dairy or grains, you can find all the info you need for free searching on google. Soak, sprout and ferment...If you want to ferment meat, you're going to have to find another source anyways.The attempt at appearing philosophical at the start of the book was purtty unimpressive.Other than all of the other problems, there is a wide variety of fermentation of products, and it will suit you well if you're a vegan/vegetarian."
2,"disclaimer: this is a recipe for ""alternative"" lifestyles","I am surprised that Amazon published this review and then 3 months later censored it and then deleted it for 'PC' purposes.Quite frankly the topic of fermented food is interesting but the author's anecdotes about transsexual behavior and transgender lifestyles are not! This book should come with a disclaimer about its so-called ""alternative"" lifestyles..."
2,too much personal ideological info to my liken.,"Normally I do not rate things that I am not thoroughly used, test or read but I make this an exceptional. first its too much personal ideological being stated in this suppose cook book.secondly you can obtain most information in the book from the internet."
2,Just not scientific enough for me,"For a book purported to be the fermentation bible I was sorely disappointed when it came to the science of fermentation. It's more of a meandering autobiography/philosophical journal with approximate instructions. I was especially disgusted by the decision to give measurements in both standard us cups/tbsp/etc and milliliters. Which means for example that a recipe might require 1 tsp of salt or 2 ml. What the heck! How on earth would I go about measuring out 2 mL of salt. If you want to bother giving two units of measure, one of them should be volume and the weight, two volumetric measurements is just redundant.It wasn't a terrible book per se, but it is next to useless to me and far short of my expectations."
1,"Extremely opinionated, light on recipes, repetitive - look for another book","I was very disappointed with this book. It has a number of flaws as I mentioned in the review title.Let me summarize 99% of the recipes for you, chop vegetables and add salt.There are much better books out there to help you get started with fermenting/pickling/canning that explain the processes well and give many variations on recipes."
3,Wild Fermenttation,"I love that we are encouraged to be creative in fermenting many items. I expected more complete receipts but enjoy the open end ideas to create on going fermentation of plants and grains. I'm glad this book is in my collection but not sure how much of a ""go to"" book this is."
3,Really needs a Table of Content for the Kindle Version,"Though I read the Kindle sample first, I thought surely the full Kindle edition would have a Table of Contents. It does not. The reason I gave this Kindle book only three stars is because of the formatting of this book. I would have liked to have seen all of the recipes in one central location. You have to sift through the book to find the recipes, even in a given section. This is really necessary when using your ebook as a cookbook."
4,"Inspires experimentation, very much an overview","This is not a cut and dried cook book nor a picture book but it does give some very interesting recipes and a good introduction to fermentation techniques. In several cases, I have found it more inspirational than in depth. For example, I found the section about ginger beer plant needed to be supplemented from the internet. However, I don't regret buying the book and we have definitely enjoyed reading it. The recipes I have followed have worked out well."
5,great book,"I really enjoy and admire the author's style and tone as well as the useful information in this book.Katz includes personal and historical background about many different fermentation processes and does a terrific job of encouraging readers to experiment and use their good judgment in adapting recipes to local circumstances. Where they overlap, the book's information accurately matches my experience and it has a useful index and sources for cultures, equipment and more.The author obviously has much experience with fermented foods as well as great enthusiasm for them."
5,Fun book,"This book has many great recipes, tips, and ideas for those who are new to the art of fermentation. Easy to follow instructions and recipes. Definitely recommend this book, even though I do not agree with his political and social philosophy."
4,Good start,This is a good book for learning some basics. He puts the subject out there in an easy and friendly way!
3,wild fermentation,I think this book will help me enjoy exploration of cheese making. I have skimmed through and now I will seriously read the whole thing. Just what I was expecting.
3,Too short,That's why I also buoght The Art Of Fermentation it takes over whear this one leaves off.. But Wild Fermatation is O.K.
1,Objectionable Additions,"I think I'm going to return this book to amazon because I just don't want to give my dollars in support of things I disagree with. The social agenda comes through in the small sections I read, including his endorsement of active homosexuality and some anti-missionary sentiment. I wish it were just a cookbook! I have compassion for Sandor Katz but I firmly disagree with some of the things he writes about."
1,Fermented Author...,"I purchased this book in conjunction with Nourishing Traditions and at the recommendation of Amazon.com. Last time I do that. The author sees nothing wrong with promoting his ""way left into oncoming traffic"" unhealthy, unappetizing, and uninteresting, alternative (being nice here) lifestyle.I would HIGHLY recommend that you NOT purchase this book, but if you were duped into buying this product, use it to start your wood cook stove."
3,Getting acquainted with death,"The author says he is facing death from disease as a relatively young man, thus he wrote the section in the book Getting acquainted with death. In it he only considers what will happen to his body. I said a prayer for Mr Katz that if he still lives that he would show the same concern for his soul and turn to God. It would be a sad sad thing to die without hope."
1,CAUTION!!! NOT A REAL COOKBOOK... A PROPAGANDA PUSHER,I have never before given this kind of a review...but then I have never needed to. Save your money and save your time! Honestly! This author is purporting his fermented belief systems. This book cooked up more than recipes for health. It has cooked up recipes about life that bring only sickness and harm in the end. I don't enjoy seeing anyone harmed. I have witnessed both friends and co-workers alike who have tested these ideas out and have ended up broken and sick in body and mind. I don't personally enjoy the gross-ness of the ideas and descriptions in this NOT cookbook. I am very surprised that this author thought it was o.k. to add his personal lifestyle choices so inter-twined in a cookbook where no one is suspecting such things ...I will avoid this author in the future because I cannot appreciate what I feel is an upside-down approach to great health... and I do not like sneaky mixes of information.
5,Wonderful book!,"This is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn more about fermentations, especially those that do not require store-bought yeast. The instructions are very easy to follow, and the conversational style of the book makes it an enjoyable read. I wish I had more room on my counters for experiments!"
2,wtf,Sony has ruined Astro boy. I really wanted to buy this series (which is the 2003 version and not the 1960's version) but I figured out that there is no japanese audio track and I have to listen to horrible dubs.Sony needs to stop distributing anime because they just ruin it.Why can't they just follow everyone else and include a japanese track and english subtitles?That's why their anime doesn't sell as much as others.
2,High Expectations,"I had these DVDs pre-ordered a month before its release under the false impression that they were original episodes from the 80's colour Astroboy series. I gushed with pleasure when I received the package (on my birthday, no less!)... and then felt my heart drop when I watched the first episode. This is not the Astroboy I watched each Saturday morning growing up. \ =Despite the eye candy this faux-Astro series tries to flaunt, anyone looking for a nostalgic dip into their past should beware. This isn't the beloved Astroboy you remember.Amazon.ca has updated this collection's details to reflect what these DVDs really are but Amazon.com still thinks they are a Billie Lou Watt flashback."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I pre-ordered this series thinking it was the original Astro Boy series, not the remake. The description on Amazons website was misleading at the time. It has since been updated. In all fairness I don't know what the new series looks like, and possibly won't because I sent it back without even opening the box. I wanted the origial series, and I hope that it will be available soon."
2,Other Character!,"in 1980, Astro Boy look like the same in 1960, but New and Old character, but Astro Boy was resale in 1981 of USA, but in 1980Astro Boy don't know, in ealry 80 all the time, 1980 is the New year to make new gratest thing, but in the 1980s, some time like evil Villains like Atals, Pluto, and the Blue Knights, and nice People like Nanka and Other one, play the GBA and PS2 Verison in your Game Collection."
3,Not bad - Not great,"First the good stuff. The animation is light years ahead of the two previous astro boy series. The characters are fairly true to the original. And, the action scenes are pretty good.Now the bad stuff. Way too much preachy political correctness. Lame dialouge. Boring synthesizer background music. And worst of all, the episodes are obviously not in chonological order! How hard is it to put the episodes in order?"
5,great remake,"Astro Boy - The Complete SeriesAs far as remakes go I really liked this one! However, I found out that this series isn't actually complete. It's missing one episode that I know of that was called Atom boy the eternal boy this would've been given a different name in english. I found it on youtube what tipped me off was the opening on the series I brought showing a kid on a flying wheel chair but there was no story in the disc set that covered it. I grew up with Astro boy and I'm glad that they're trying to bring it back. They stayed true to the original drawing design and yet gave it a fresh modern look and a good story line as far as I'm concerned. Seeing it in color for the first time was great. I here theres a 3d movie coming out in 2009 about Astro Boy too."
3,This DVD was ok...,"for one they should have edited out the parts where they cut to commercials and also they should have taken their time and put these episodes in order. That's right they arn't in order, they say they're in order on dvd but the episodes are all messed up, like for instance you see an episode with astro's sister right out of the blue then 3 or so episodes later you see the creation of astro's sister. Sony picture's totally screwed up on this box set"
2,"I want THE ORIGINAL, too!","Where in the world is the ORIGINAL Astro Boy series on DVD? By far, it is the best Astro Boy series ever made. Maybe its release is being held up to coincide with the film that has been in the works for eons. No matter: it's a crime that fans all over the country who remember and love the 1960's version have to continue to be denied.This release is the most recent version...it ran on the WB and Cartoon Network; both pulled the plug quickly. And the late, great Billie Lou Watt is not the voice here, either...she can be heard on the original English versions---IF SOMEONE SOMEWHERE WOULD HAVE THE GOOD SENSE TO RELEASE THEM! I'm holding out for those original cartoons. They're the real, genuine Astro Boy."
5,Astro Boy 2003,"I'm a person of few words, but I was very satisfied with the delivery speed and the condition of the package."
4,Astroboy,"I loved him when I was a boy, and I still love him as a man. These modernized Astro Boy animes are a must see for the kid in all of us."
3,Does NOT come with capacitor,"The motor works great when connected to a capacitor. I purposely did not purchase the cap because the item description surprisingly stated that it included the capacitor (""Required 5 MFD 370V Capacitor Included""). Indeed it did not come with one. So this could not be installed when promised and we had to wait longer for a cap to arrive."
4,From the book,"After being introduced to the worldview of process thought, Christian readers so often ask: ""But how can this worldview be connected with traditional Christian belief and practice?"" This book offers a process response to the questions that are truly on people's minds: Is God personal? Is prayer effective? Who was Jesus? It presents a way of thinking about Christian faith, and living the Christian life, that is a viable alternative to fundamentalism on the one hand and lukewarm liberalism on the other. It displays a Christianity with roots and wings."
3,Be carefull of your order,"I recieved this pretty quick USPS standard. However I ordered the system, or so I thought. The box the wrap was in was a mess. The other items were fine as well as the outer box. The product box stated that this was indeed the system but there was NO bar tape inside as the box clearly stated there should be. When I did another search I found one for $14.99 with gray tape and one for 17.94 from the same vendor I bought from that states that it comes with black tape. It doesn't say it's on sale or clearance,(at the time of this writing). So why would they sell just the pillows for $20.60 and the entire set for $17.96? It's not worth my time and expence to send it back. Maybe that is what they counted on? Someone sent this back minus the tape and now they are trying to get rid of it for a bigger profit? What would you think? Product works great but... Buyer beware!"
2,Half of it was missing,"The package arrived with half the contents missing. The remainder looked like it had been dredged out of Lake P after Katrina. I returned the package and to Amazon's great credit, they refunded the purchase price and shipping entirely."
4,"Very cushy, but makes the handlebars very thick.","This works great to absorb the shocks of riding, and I use my road bike for off-roading with my son, so that's important to me, but it does make the handlebars very thick, which doesn't bother me, but has bothered him when he rode my bike."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the same Aztec VibeWrap 2 years ago. I was disappointed that this package did not include the black adhesive ""Bar Wrap""! Was this an oversight or does Aztec no longer include ""Bar Wrap""?"
3,Aztec,I would of liked to know degree of dificulty some examples of how to do it. It is an improvemnet to my bars. Needs more directions.If you never have wraped bars before it will take some doing.They nshould last a long time. I can always rewrap them
1,Missing the Scroll Frame,"The picture provide you with the complete package, but when you get the product a ""little note"" on the package tell you now you have to purchase the ""SCROLL FRAME SEPERATELY"", THE QUESTION IS why ?."
1,Half-hearted effort from a talented team,"Lazy, lazy work from everyone involved.Ennis first portrayed Nick Fury in his Steve Dillion-partnered run on thePunisher: Welcome Back, Frank Premiere HC (Punisher)and this is an uninspired, insipid spin-off. The gags are dull and plot is recycled. Even the patented ultraviolence (and the deliberately offensive dialogue) feels watered-down and off-key. The slapstick goofiness is a sour note as well - this miniseries feels like something crafted from Ennis's cutting-room floor.Not even worth it for the Ennis/Robertson completist - readThe Boys Vol. 1: The Name of the Gameinstead."
5,A Big Box of Chocolates,"Once in a very great while, someone sends baseball a great big valentine in book form (David Lamb's Stolen Season comes immediately to mind). Such it is with Collins' book. The Last Best League reminds us of why some of us fell in love with the game to begin with - the pace, the sounds, the smells, the kids without the arrogance. It certainly is the best piece of baseball non-fiction I've read in quite a number of years"
5,"One Summer, One Season, One Great Book","Jim Collin's book is THE most enjoyable sports book I have read in over a decade. Maybe it's the ephemeral beauty of a single Cape Cod summer, maybe it's the timeless coming of age saga, or maybe it's just a story of three individuals, any one of whom could be a brother, a friend or a neighbor. I believe it is all of these - you don't just read this book, you feel it - the Chatham fog, the building summer heat, the unmet athletic expectations and the frustration of players sensing their athletic futures unravelling with each unsuccessful at bat. The stories flow together seamlessly . . . I'll be looking for more from Jim Collins."
3,you have to like baseball,"You have to like baseball.It was an interesting story and I felt that I leaned a lot about baseball and the process to get to ""The Big Show""."
4,Summer in New England,"Jim Collin's THE LAST BEST LEAGUE is a well-written look at a summer of baseball at the famous Cape Cod League. Collins evenly divides the book between the local manager who views the League as his big time and the collegiate superstars under him who are often humbled for the first time by superior pitching and wood bats. The underlying question is what separates a major leaguer from the rest, and the answer at times seems to be not much--one or two bloops that fall a week for a hitter or a pitcher who for one magic season can light up a radar gun. At the other times,the answer is pure athleticism or stick-to-it-ness."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is an abosolute waste of $$. He describes his own book as a ""how to"" but does not describe how to do anything. He basically describes things that can be done, but does not provide any useful pictures/diagrams and provides no insight for 'anyone' on what the different components look like, located, etc. It gives a list of thing that may have to be removed or checked, but not a lot of detail on what to look for. This strictly deals with maintenance issues and not how to 'repair' anything."
5,Striking photography of the Midwest.,"Kanfer certainly has an eye for the little details that give the scenery of the Midwest its own particular charm. Beautiful landscapes captured by a master photographer. A ""must"" for those living in the region, as well as those like myself who've moved on to other places and enjoy reacquainting ourselves with surroundings once familiar."
3,It's just okay,"Brush head is so large it doesn't flex to clean grate very well. It only took a few uses to crack the handle. I won't buy it again, unfortunately, I ordered an extra brush head right away."
1,Plastic Handle Cracked 1st time using,Do not recommend...1st time using the plastic on the handle cracked...the underlying steel handle flexes too much causing the plastic encasement to crack...flexing handle makes cleaning difficult.
5,The ultimate Greene & Greene book,"If you want one lush, visually opulant but also well-researched book on the Greene brothers and their unique accomplishments in the arts & crafts style, and money is no object, this is the one to get. If it IS an object, Makinson's earlier, smaller paperback, Greene and Greene: Architecture As A Fine Art, will do nicely as a overview of their residential architecture career, but be warned----eventually you'll probably want color photographs. If you've ever visited one of their remaining houses that are open to the public, you know that the color tonalities of the rooms are a considerable part of their charm, and you've probably already bought this book. If you havn't, don't wait 'til it goes out of print. This is THE Greene and Greene book, coffee table or otherwise."
1,disappointed!!!,"i thought plaguarism was unlawful,this is clearly a copy army (fm 31-21 1961) don't waste your time or your money.Special Forces Guerrilla Warfare Manual"
3,Decent book,If you have an interest in studing guerrilla warefare from a commander perspective this book is perfect for you.
4,Good heater,"The delivery was a little rough, scrunched into a box too small to hold it properly. And, it required some assembly, the suction cups had to be fitted into the bracket - a little difficult, but I was able to handle it. The features of the heater itself are very nice, the power lite and temperature scale are very nice."
3,best of videos arent execatly the best to buy,this was a little better then most of the best of wcw videos but only rentable quality. its got the birth of the nwo to the very first one which was cactus jack vs. sting. then they go to hogan/flair in 94. then to 96 when hogan turned heel and the nwo was formed. then they also put the 97 one on there.
2,Sucked!,I was very disappointed in this video it showed some of the worst matches in Bash at the Beach history. The only good thing is it showed the transformation of Hulk Hogan to Hollywood Hogan that's the only reason it doesen't get one star.
3,Its alright,Its dumb that they have matches on theoutside ofthe box that arnt on the tape. I just thought they could have picked a couple better matches to make the tape and why do that HAVE tohave one from each year just pick the best matches.
3,great aid for teachers,"This is a great aid for English teachers of middle school students. I would not recommend this for every Friday last period, but is useful for fillers towards the end of term. You can use these activities from Years 7 through to 9, however, with year 9 you may have to make some of the activities more challenging. Bravo to the authors!"
5,GREAT Resource,"I love, love, love this resource. Every single activity is ""do-able"" and fun and creative. It promotes creative thinking, and you hardly ever find a ditto book that can do that. Using sources is a standard in my state, and the dictionary scavenger hunts are perfect. Couldn't live without this book!"
5,MatttheCat,"Bought this for one song I couldn't get anywhere else. What a great surprise. While the originals are classics, Dean puts his mark on each song. Glad I bought it!"
4,Share a tear with Dino,Relax as Dean takes you back with some great tearjerkers. These songs will bring back great memories of past loves in your life.
5,tex martin strikes again,"this will be my second time buying this disc. I wore out my first one. I' ve always been a great fan of Dean, and consider him a very close second as the greatest all around entertainer of our time, 1st goes to Bing Crosby. The songs on this disc are tastefully done. Dean's voice meshes with country music very well. The only questionable song on this disc is He's Got You, The gender switch doesn't quite fit the bill. However Dean's voice compensates for that. It's been said Dean wanted to do country material but Capitol wouldn't let him. When he went to buddy Frank's Reprise label he had more freedom to do what he wanted. I also have his Dean Martin Sings Country Favorites box set. I reccomend it for anyone who enjoys Dean singing country music. It's also available on Amazon.com"
2,Unremarkable,Dean can be charming but these are bland arrangements and blander performances of some country hits.
3,Good Historical Synopsis,"The title of this book may be a bit misleading because the true focus of the book is not individual stories or experiences in the legion, rather a condensed and well written historical account. For anybody considering joining the legion, this wouldn't be the best source of information. Little attention is given to the legion today though it does touch on some of the mystical aspects of this sacred corps."
1,Wii Over heats,My Wii overheated in this stand. I contacted Nintendo and they said to take it our and replace with the original stand. This is not a licenced Nintendo product even though it has the Wii emblem on it.
1,Not worth the money,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the Wii doesn't even fit correctly in this stand and doesn't have a vent so the system tends to overheat. Also, the slots for the game cases are so shallow that the cases will not stay upright and keep falling over. What a waste of money and plastic!"
4,Scrapbooking pens,These are great pens. two tips and easy to carry. Matched everything. Love the box too.
3,A bit repetitive though still a good read,"I enjoyed this book though it did get a bit repetitive in the 13th chapter ""Traverse"". I haven't been able to find a sequel though if I do I may read it to see what happens next."
1,Terrible,"Although I love disaster stories, this book was absolutely boring. It didn't hold my attention and the ending was poor. And there's a sequel?"
4,Jowett Javlin Jupiter,"This is a terrific book on a little known sportcar seldom seen even in England, and much more rare in the U.S.There were only 8 of these cars here in 1954 when my brother owned his. Jowett had made other models that I was unfamiliar with. Good pictures which were interesting, but would have liked to have seen more color photos.It had terrific history of how the company evolved, and went into a lot of interesting details about their cars."
2,Iron fist,"What has happened to my favorite hero? I have read and own every Executioner book and most of the Superbolan and Stonyman books and I can't believe what is happening. IRON FIST is (bad) science fiction. I was barely able to work my way through it. Sometimes I'd have to read the same page several times just to try to make some sense out of it. I've noticed this trend in other Executioner books. I guess he has run out of real enemies so now we must go to impossible ones. I'm sorry but if I can't believe in the ememy I sure can't believe in the hero! I'm sure that somewhere there must be a room full of authors who write these books now. Listen up guys, you're losing it. It is too bad, I'll miss reading this series if it doesn't change."
5,Highly Recommended,"I highly recommend this series for helping students with writing research papers. If you buy the whole series, it will take you from picking a research topic to completing the final draft. I have been a college professor for over 20 years, and I was looking for a series on writing that I could recommend to my freshman classes for additional help with writing their final term research papers. I found this series, and the response from the students have been positive. Even though these DVD's are a little expensive, I am pleased to say that it was worth the money I paid. You don't have to be a teacher to see the value in this series, anyone from high school to college will gain an in site on how to write a better paper from this series. If your struggling, or simply starting out in your academic writing career, I highly recommend this series."
2,Another To-Do List,"No matter how long your to-do list is, this book will double it. It is nothing more than a long list of items with a little ""creativity-slang"" thrown on top. I only gave it two stars because someone who has never looked at time management in depth may find it useful; however, choosing any other time management book, even with eyes closed, would be a better choice."
5,Wonderful book by someone who is right-brained himself.,"This book has so many great suggestions. I'm trying out tons of them and recommending this book to all my artistic friends. I think a lot of people who are labeled as ""defective"" and ""diseased"" in terms of ADD are actually right-brained, and we should bring back this non-pejorative ""label"" again, instead."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is a hastily cobbled together piece of worthless junk. Written in ""bullets"" so disorganized as to render the content meaningless, it includes such helpful tips as ""Hire a personal trainer or U.S. Marine Corps sergeant to get you going."" Believe me, your best time management move is to NOT waste any time looking at this book."
5,one of the best of the genre,"Mr. Silber has managed to write a book that is funny, down to earth, and immensely helpful. His stories are priceless, and the tips are ridiculously useful and easy to implement."
1,HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA,This is quite possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen!HAHAEVERYONE! GO TO BLOCKBUSTER AND RENT THIS MOVIE (don't buy it cause once u see it u'll never want to see it again) AND WATCH IT! CAUSE IT'S SOOOOO TERRIBLE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY!
3,BACK TO THE FUTURE MEETS PEGGY SUE GETS MARRY,HONESTLY I WAS EXPECTING MORE OF THIS MOVIE BUT I WAS KINDA DESAPPOINTED EVEN THOUGH IT GOT A VERY GOOD POINT. WHY'S IT SO HARD TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER EXACTLY THE WAY WE'RE MEANT TO BE??
1,One Star is too much for Almost Normal,"I really regretted taking Amazon's advise to purchase this DVD. My partner and I couldn't finish the movie it was so silly, poorly done and juvenile. Almost Normal will make a great ""White Elephant"" gift come Christmas."
2,Not funny,"I bought this after seeing the preview; it's not even remotely funny. I felt that the wrong actors were chosen; I didn't connect or feel for any of the characters; plus the dialogue needed work. Too many lines which seem to have been added in by a b-movie script writer. Don't buy, maybe rent."
3,"Could have been done better, but still has a point","It's truly amazing how some people consider themselves film critics who can't do anything except call a film ""the best ever"" or ""the worst ever,"" depending on whether they liked it or not, or else call it a (fill in the blank) remake of some past film which shared some plot element. How shallow and ignorant, how arrogant! The ""critic"" who repeatedly used the word ""sattire"" (sic) can't even SPELL it correctly, much less does he understand what it means. It's true this film doesn't have the best acting talent and could certainly have been made much better, but look past it at the theme and the way the plot twists get you to think, if you are capable. And just because the main character seems to travel in time doesn't make it the ""Gay Back To The Future/Peggy Sue Got Married."" If this is how the average moviegoer thinks, and the film industry shapes itself on box office revenue, then that doesn't hold much hope for the industry's future, does it?"
2,Not One of the Most Exciting,"This one is disapppointing compared to the other Barney videos we own. We watched the set one time, and the kids have not asked for it again. This is unusual. The content is NOT too advanced for 1-3 year olds....it's just not exciting. I think that the most exciting part was when the kids sang a song about shapes when they were painting them in the classroom. There was a hunt for shapes, and the kids made telescopes out of cardboard tubes and colored plastic wrap and looked at things. This was not a good day in Barney studios."
5,A great teaching show!,"While this show does not have advanced graphics like the newer Barney videos, it still teaches basic shapes and colors. This Barney two-pack contains the ""Barney & Friends"" episodes: ""The Treasure of Rainbow Beard"" and ""Red, Blue, and Circles too!"" ""The Treasure of Rainbow Beard"" has the characters: Barney, Derek, Michael, Kathy, and Min. It includes the songs: A Hunting We Will Go, The Green Grass Grows all Around, Frère Jaques, and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. ""Red, Blue, and Circles too!"" has some of the same songs as the other show, but it also has some different songs like: Pop goes the weasel, My Yellow Blankey, and the Flag March song. I think these shows are the best teaching shows for colors and shapes that have ever been created!"
2,"Kind of Dated, Kind of Scary","Well, the content is good (colors and shapes are important), but the pirate scared my 2 1/2 year old. Plus the tape is pretty dated, there are so many better Barney tapes."
