1,horrible book for animal murderers,"i am thirteen years old and i barely ever cry. at the end of this book i seriously bawled!!!!!! i would definately not recomend this book to people who love animals as much as i do. these people who say this is a ""heartwarming adventure"",no offense, are horribly WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! this book made me loose alot of my faith in God because i refuse to find something good in him killing these two loyal dogs who saved their master from a mountain lion. i HATED this book more than i hate al gore. which says ALOT!!!!!!!!!!! this was my least favorite book ever and ive read some really stupid books"
2,"Sexist and Religious oriented, but still entertaining.","This book was overall a good read. It was very entertaining. What I did not enjoy was the religious propaganda contained in it as well as the sexist comments and thoughts of the main character. I think is an OK old book, but as many old books, it is not up to date with the views of our modern society."
2,BORING!,This book is soooooo boring! We read this book this year in school and I literaly fell asleep! OMG! I hate this book! It is soo old it's hard to understand what they are talking about! It would be way better if it were more modernized!
5,book,"I thought the book was very good. The reason is it has very good description. When it said Little Ann glistened in the sunlight at the beauty competition. It was also funny. When Grandpa looked at his hair brush and it had little red hairs in it. It was also full of action, like when Billy fought the freckle faced kid in Talequa.Also when Old Dan and Little Ann would chase coons. If you like dogs this is a book for you. The only part you would not like is the end. Both dogs die. Old Dan dies on his way home from fighting a mountain lion with Little Ann. How he died is he got a gash in his stomach. Little Ann died because her love for dan made her depressed, there for she could'nt handle the loss. So in conclusion, this boy, Billy worked hard for what he wanted and got it. Then his dogs and him became champions."
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,This book is sooooo good! It is about a boy who wants to have dogs so badly that he leaves his own home just so he could get two. But before he does he needs to save his money. He sees an arcticle in the paper telling about hound puppies. Male and femailes. He wants one but his parents say he can't have them. He goes out while they are sleeping to get them. He sleeps in caves and on the ground and walks bare-footed across the country. On his way he gets bullied around and beat up. When he finally gets there he forgot about what he would carry the puppies in. Then he sees someone with a gunny-sack and gets it off of them for free. He puts the puppies in there and brings them all the way home. They are still little puppies when he decides to bring hunting. He teaches them what to do. Then a faitful accident comes that will leave you breathless.This is the best book. You will fall in love with it from the start just like I did.
2,simply hunting,"""Where the red fern grows"" is a good book but as titled it is simply hunting. watching the characters do the same thing over and over again becomes boring. I also find it somewhat interesting because some parts are sort of cool. this book I found hard to finish because of the slow drabbing continual repition of words and scenes"
5,Where the Red Fern Grows,"Where the Red Fern Grows is an adventurous book. I like this book because it was exciting, and it was about dogs. I think a lot of people would like this book. William Rawls is my favorite, adventure witting, author. He writes many adventure books, that I can't wait till read them.The ending was very sad, because the two dogs die. I almost cried on that part of the book. this is a really good book."
5,An ageless tale,"I remember reading this book for school, I think, it's been a long time. I wasn't prepared for the story, it was great. I've now listened to the audiobook and am again stunned by the book. The narrator is EXCELLENT. His voice just fits this book. Like the book just listening to this man I picture it all in my head. This book is timeless and should be read as a child and re-read as an adult. I never cared for the tiny print of the book, and if you are like me, the audiobook is the way to go.However, it should come with a warning....tears will appear, you will cry, you will feel warm and fuzzy, you'll never forget this book."
4,An amazing book about a boy and his dogs,"I loved Where the Red Fern Grows. The boy in the book really wants a couple of dogs more than anything. He has to work really hard to get them. The love between the three is amazing. I really enjoyed this book. I like the country setting and how the people have to work hard for their lives. The ending of the book is very sad, but readers of any ages will love this book."
4,Fantastic Fantasy By:JMW Grade 5,"It's another day in the river bottoms and for a boy named Billy it's another day without a pair of clever hunting dogs. When growing up in a poor family exhorting his parents every single day will not be enough. But after many tiring months of saving money, Billy got the determined hounds he longed for. Even though Old Dan, the brave one and Little Ann, the smart one are two of the best hounds in the town, Billy still needed to put his dogs to the test. In a compettion the weather is rough and Old Dan and Little Ann are lost. This book is a stunning book for anyone who is bored and wants a great book to read."
4,Review of Where the Red Fern Grows,"This is an excellent book to use in the classroom. Students of all ages would enjoy this book, because it shows the close bond that people share with their pets. This book teaches students many valuable lessons such as, friendship, love, loyalty, sacrificing, and coping with the hardship of losing loved ones. Where the Red Fern Grows would be interesting to students in 4th grade and above."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.,"I think everybody should read this book because it is one of the best books I have ever read in my whole life. It is the BEST!!!!!!!!! But beware there is going to be a terrible happening at the end. Make sure you have a box of tissues nearby because it is very, very, sad. As I said, I recommend this book to all ages because it is a heart warming story of a boy and his two wonderful dogs."
5,To read this book is to be young again,"Anyone who has ever owned, loved and lost a dog will cherish the memories and the warmth this book brings."
5,"The book was fantastic, but extremely sad.",This book is very sad but exciting. You never know what to expect. The book is very realistic. It makes me think about my dogs.
5,PERFECT BOOK!!!!,"I LOVED IT!!!!I had to read it for school.I thought it would just be some normal book to read for school.I WAS WRONG!This book was wonderfully written.Although,I didn't think the d-word was necessary.I still loved it!I will definitely read it again.I cried when the dogs died.I can't imagine how sad I would be if my two beautiful Beagles died.I would be so sad.I am so glad I read this book.I watched the movie,but they cut out quite a few parts.I wish they hadn't.This book is one of my favorites."
5,It is a great book about a boy and his wonderful dogs.,The author Wilson Rawls created a masterpiece. About a boy and his willingness to earn enough money to get the dogs he wanted. Then for him not to tell his family and go into town and get them. Then to get them and train them how to hunt.His Grandfather showed him what to do. Then the dogs were entered into a hunting contest. Then the love the boy showed. This is a great book that everyone should read!!
5,THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK,"This was a terrific book.Once you read this book you will not be able to put it down!!!If you are a dog lover you will love this book. Me and all of my friends read this book together. One of my friends is a great dog lover!!!She cried at the end!!I thought that everyone should read this book if they can!!!!!When you or if you ever get a chance to read this book, get some tissues. It is a very sad story!!HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,where the red fern grows a must red book,I like this book because it was exciting and espeacially when Little Ann get trapped on a block of ice or when Old Dan gets stuck in a tree. I think that Wilson Rawls did the best on the characters because he exp-lained and told what they felt and how they acted.This book made me think about what life can be like. I think that you should defantly read this book because you would really like it. Life is like when you are on a roller coaster your scared but excited.
5,A book that realy hits home for me,"I first read Where The Red Fern Grows when I was 13 years old. I had seen the movie on several occasions, but it wasnt untill the sad death of my own Old Dan that I felt that I just had to read the book. Like the Coleman family, mine was very poor living in the dried up south east Texas oil fields. Many was the time that My only companion was my dog Old Dan. Many was the time that the only activities there were for me to do was going exploring through the woods that surrounded our home for miles and miles. I would find it hard to believe that anyone cant find some part of this story to relate to. Before I read Where The Red Fern Grows, I had never read a book in my life. Not only did I discover a wonderful story that I was almost living out myself, but also I discovered a massive love for reading. All I can say is that you are selling yourself short if you dont read this story. I think I'll go pick up my copy and read it again."
1,Where The Red Fern Grows,"I disliked this book. I dislike this book because it made me cry. It made me cry because a boy tripped on an ax and died, one dog died from a mountain lion, and the other dog died of grief, and the dogs killed raccoons. There were many sad parts and not many happy parts."
1,A Good Book For People Who Love To Cry,"I am a total book-worm and I am up for reading any book. I had to do this book for a report, I like dogs so I thought it would be a good book. The constant crying and sobbing, I just can't couldn't take it. I struggled to finih this book. This is a good book for people who love to cry. Drama people. This book was not for me and I do not reccomend this book to ANYONE."
3,Good writing but way too sad.....,"The writer is talented but the story itself is just TOO SAD! I feel that a good plot has a nice balance of good and bad events and this story was not balanced. I don't mind a sad ending, or a bittersweet ending, personally I just don't like so much gloom and doom in one story. There is so much pain and heartbreak in the story it seems almost like the writer is a little sadistic or else had a tough childhood! I think this book might be a little much for younger kids or sensitive readers but it's a good story if you are into heartache, drama, some adventure and really, really sad and fairly gory and bloody scenes."
5,Adam's Exquisite Review,"Where the Red Fern Grows, is about a boy named Billy who lives in the Ozark Mountains in Oklahoma. Billy is a 13 year old boy who wants to get dogs. He doesn't want just dogs; he wants two coon hounds. Billy asks his parents, but they don't have the money. So Billy saves $50 for two years to get the two hounds. He had buckets full of berries to sell to people like the fisherman. When Billy gets his dogs, he starts training them. He names them Old Dan and Little Ann. His grandpa tells Billy about this coon hunting tournament. Billy didn't want to go, because he was involved in Rubin's accident. After a while he says he will go. Billy might win the gold cup if he gets a lot of coons. Will Billy win the gold cup? I hope you will read this 5 star book someday, because it's a wonderful book to read. The excitement never stops!"
5,Great and exciting!!,"The book,""Where The Red Fern Grows"" is a very interesting book. It has a well written plot and is quite discriptive. I read it in 6th grade and then we watched the movie version. Both movie and book brought tears to my eyes."
5,The best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Billy, a hardworking boy who lives by the Ozark Mountains in the Cherokee country, has two redbone hunting hounds, Old Dan and Little Ann. He trained them to be the best raccoon hunters in the country. Old Dan has the brawn, and Little Ann has the brain, and together, with Billy, they won the championship coon hunt. Glory and victory comes to them, but sadness awaits too. Read how Old Dan and Little Ann defends Billy from the deadly jaws of a mountain lion. And read how the sacred red fern connected to the deaths of Old Dan and Little Ann in the most breathtaking way. Where the Red Fern Grows is a heartwarming tale of adventure and friendship you'll never forget."
4,Where the Red Fern Grows,"Where the Red Fern Grows is a touching story of loyalty and the hope of an Oklahoman boy and his two faithful hound dogs.Billy wanted hound dog puppies all of his life, but since the great depression is going on, his family just cannot afford two hound dog puppies costing 50 dollars. Soon Billy's ""puppy wanting sickness"" gets so bad he doesn't even eat. Billy uses his grandfather's trick of catching raccoons and sells them for roughly 10 cents a piece for more than three years straight, and finally raises enough money for his hounds.The day he gets them he starts their training and soon he learns what an extremely loyal, hardworking team they are. Where the Red Fern Grows will take you through the life and thoughts (that will soon feel like your own) of a young Oklahoman boy with enough hopes and dreams for 10 more boys.I would recommend this book to anyone from about the age of 11 and older. This book is especially good for boys or girls who like animals."
4,A great book,"I loved where the red fern grows, because it was happy,great, and enjoyable. It also was sad, because something happens to Billy's two dogs.Also I love dogs.i liked how the author handled the charaters in this story.You know exactly what and where the charaters are and doing.It made me think about crying, because it was sad.Also would I ever do what Billy did.Yes I would totally recommed this book to a friend,because it was sort of sad but some was not and Billy got his two great hounds.I really liked this book."
4,A Man's Best Friends!,"Do you like long books, guns, dogs, and hunting? Then I suggest Where the Red Fern Grows is a book for you. A boy desperately wants dogs. His parents do not have enough money.So he buys the dogs himself. He trans the dogs very hard and names them Old Dan and Little Ann.They became the best dogs in that state.I thought this was an okay book. I give this book two stars.I recommend this book to people who like hunting a lot. I think this book is for older people like adults."
5,where the read fern grows,I realy liked the book becouse i felt like I was in the book.And I realy like dogs.And I was interested the book.The setting was in kentucky moutains in the ozarks by a farm and a country store this made me think that you dont have to have what ever you want by asking you can work for it.this book can teachyou many lessons by reading the book.You should get the book and read where the red fern grows.
4,Where the Red Fern Grows book review,"Where the Red Fern Grows is a book about a young boy who sees an ad for some hounds dogs. He starts saving up money. When he finally has enough to buy them he sends in the money and the dogs come. He loves to coon hunt with the dogs, so his grandfather tells him he should enter the coon hunt race. Although there was tough competition Billy and his dogs won the coon hunt race and took home a trophy and some cash. I liked this book because it was interesting the whole way through and once you start reading it you cant stop. It keeps getting more and more interesting! It has a sad but good ending to it that's makes it one of my favorite books."
4,Ashley - Richveiw middle school,When i first read this book i love it!! The ending was so sad when the lil dan died then lil ann died on his grave. The story is about a boy who really wants a dog but there family was very poor .He was at his grandfathers shop and he said there was 2 dogs just up the river waiting for a home. But they would cost him some money.A few weeks went by and he did everything he could to earn the money to get those dogs. Well he finallly got the money and went to is grandfathers store and showed him the the money. But the dogs wouldnt be in for about a week but he couldnt wait. Trust me you really need to read this book it is so good. Really READ IT!
5,The book that has touch my life and millions of others,"I have just read that book ""where the Red Fern Glows"" by Wilson Rawls and have really been emotional touched by the stong plot. For not a moment did i feel left in the dust, not knowing what was going on. All the time i felt as though i was on track and though out evey inch of the story amazed. More children must read this marvalous book and enjoy the rich vocabualary and the maraculous plot. Wilson Rawls really desires more reconision, for he has really brought out the real meaning of life!Me only being elevn years old have reconized it. You too can take home this wonderful book too and enjoy the wonderful writing of Wilson Rawls! So please take the time to read this amazingly marvalous book!"
3,Adventure Lovers,"Wilson Rawl's brilliant descriptions such as, ""White sheets of water, knocked high in the moonlight as his churning feet, gleamed like thousands of tiny white stars,"" paints a picture in the mind of the reader. You not only see the environment, you feel what Billy, the main character, is feeling. We could feel his pride in his dog, Little Ann, as she won the silver cup for best looking dog. If we could have asked for more, it would have been more information about his three sisters and other characters that weren't so important. The book showed Wilson Rawl's true talent as an author. I would recommend it to any adventure lover."
2,Even better 15 years later!!!,"I read this book as a young boy and remember crying even though I didn't want to. I didn't think boys should cry back then. I finished reading this book again, tonight and my eyes welled up with tears just like the first time. This time I was able to just enjoy the emotion instead of try and block it. The greatest thing about this book is the timelessness of the story. I think all children should read this book and all adults should read it, or revisit it. It's a beautiful story of the indescribable bond between a dog and his owner. Filled with hope and innocence. Should be on every bookshelf."
3,different cover,arrived quick and was how it was described. The only thing is that I thought the cover would be like the one in the picture but it wasn't.
5,the BEST book I` ve ever read!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dear reader,This book is so exciting, sad, joyful, brave, and loving. This book is cool for kids 12 and under like me. This book is very adventurous and great for people who like dogs. Hope you like the book. [I know you will]"
2,Some tracks left out,"Basically a fair product, but some of the novel is left out when you play the CD. It jumps ahead in the novel, leaving out the tracks you need for earlier."
4,where the red fern grew for ever,This was a good book for childern 8 to 16 . The entire book was a flash back and that kind of was a let down. although the ather did a good job of making it seem like you were there .
3,bored yet intrigued,"I didn't think this book was very ""eye-catching"", but it is very detailed. I got bored at some parts of the book, but since it is so goodly written I was intrigued to know what would happen next. I would say this is a good book to try out, but It isn't a type of book I would read again. I enjoyed this book because the story was complete and the plot was easy to understand."
3,What I think about this book,"I thought that overall, Where The Red Fern Grows was a good book. It was not one of the greatest books i've read but I would reccomend it to anyone who is in the mood for a good book. This book had certain parts that had great details and lots of action. These parts kept me interested. I first read this book in 5th grade and i thought it was alot better the second time around.This book was about Billy's adventures, his love for his dogs, and the courage and determination he has throughout his adventures. Billy's love and determination is only one of the things that I think made the book good. I think that many of us can relate to Billy and what he was going through. I think that this is a great book for anyone that is interested in action,adventure and a little bit of sadness. If you read this book I think you yourself are in for an adventure."
4,a great book to read again and again,"In my personal opinion, This book teaches many lessons for everybody. One such example is that hard work will get you many good things out of life. This Book is also very emotional (meaning that you will probably want to cry when you finish the book). One thing you should probably know is that in the book Wilson Rawls uses the word 'coon'. Don't worry - this is an abreviation for racoon. Another very interesting fact is that this book is based on a true story (probably Wilson's)."
3,Karissa's oppinion (IT COUNTS),The Red fern Grows was an ok book. I didn't like how a lot of the animals died. Old Dan and Little Ann both die. It was a very detailed book so it was good.
3,A o.k book,"It was a o.k book, But it was pretty cool. I would give it three stars cool. I would reckement it."
3,red fern review,The red fern is a nice story if you like hunting coons.I liked when Billy decided to go to the coon hunting coontest.I guess I liked because of the ecitment.The boring part was the beginning.I like action it get you realy into the story.All books I think are boring at the beginnings.So it's not bad there's just no action.At the beginningit talked about how his family dosen't have ennough money toget Billy hunting dogs.Then Billy savedhis money and got his huntinng dogs.With the rest of his money he spent it on his faamily.I think it's a okay book..
5,I loved this book!!!!!!!!,"I thought this book was very exciting for children 9 and up!!! A little boy works hard to earn enough money to buy two dogs. When he gets the two dogs he teaches them to hunt and they are realy good at it. Old Dan, Little Ann, and Billy or so real. This is a book that when you start to read you can't put it down it is so good!!!! I would recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a very good book!!!!!"
5,This is a wonderful book for kids ages 9 and up.,"This book is an excellent story of a boy who works hard to earn money to get 2 dogs. When he gets his dogs he has a wonderful time hunting and playing with them.Through the eyes of a child this is a sad, happy, and loving book that should be in every family."
5,"This is a story of a boy,his dogs,and all their expectations","One day all Billy's dreams were answered.He got his dogs,and went coon crazy.A lot of events happened. He entered a Championship Coon Hunting Contest and won!Then one night Billy went hunting and got attacked by a moutainlion.That night the dogs....But when Billy went back to the grave there was a red fern."
5,Gotta Read W here the Red Fern Grows By Daisy M. M.,"Where the Red Fern Grows was a good book. It did not have too many details or too few details. The author had just right. I just wanted to tell you if you go into a bookstore, you might no even think about getting Where The Red Fern Grows, but when you see a boy on a cover and his two red pups - get it!"
5,Best Kid Book Ever,"I've read this book to my 3rd, 4th & 5th grade students for years (as did my mother before me). I believe it is a must-read for children. I purchased the CDs because 1) it is read exactly as written, 2) because the reader (Anthony Heald) is excellent and gives you the feel of the times and place, and 3) even after many years of reading aloud, I still have trouble reading without tears, so this was my alternative. My students enjoy listening and they wind up loving this book and they all say it is SO much better than the movie. I've had several students who have told me or their parents that ""this book changed my life."" Reading is best, but for traveling or other purposes, this is a great alternative. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
4,Where the red fern grows,This old boook was fun to the end.It's about an 11 year old boy that is dying to get two con-hounds to hunt with.
5,Where the Red Fern Grows,"It is a beautiful sad story. The way the story was written, it makes you feel you are part of it."
2,Its About Billy and how he loved old Dan and little ann,I love this book!! I abusltly love the ending it's sad that little Ann and old Dan died .but when Billy saw that there was a red fern growing there I thought that was really cool! It really showed how'd Billy loved his dogs.
2,The subject is too intent on killing ~ not a pleasant subject for young people.,The boy's entire life is consumed by his desire to hunt and kill animals.I am an adult and would not give this book to my grandchildren. It is very unpleasant and bloody. Did not like it at all.
4,Still with me,I had to read this book in 5th or 6th grade. The passion the protagonist had for dogs and 'cooning has stuck with me. Twenty years later and I still find myself thinking of the book.
1,Jenny's review on Where the Red Fern Grows,I think this book was ok because somethings were too detailed and his life was way to perfect. He has to work on his crying issuses. He's always crying. I liked that he was telling the strory in his own words. I liked that the dogs did everything together.
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"You might think I'm joking when I say it's the worst book I've ever read. Sad thing is, I'm dead serious. If every book was like this the world would have no reason to be literate. Do not waste your money or time. It's awful."
1,Mis-leading listing,"I was looking for a hardcover version of this book, and what I purchased was listed under the hardcover search and had hardcover on the top line of the listing. Imagine my surprise when I received a PAPERBACK edition"
5,Even better 15 years later!!,"I read this book as a young boy and remember crying even though I didn't want to. I didn't think boys should cry back then. I finished reading this book again, tonight and my eyes welled up with tears just like the first time. This time I was able to just enjoy the emotion instead of try and block it. The greatest thing about this book is the timelessness of the story. I think all children should read this book and all adults should read it, or revisit it. It's a beautiful story of the indescribable bond between a dog and his owner. Filled with hope and innocence. Should be on every bookshelf."
5,NEED TO READ!!!!!,"I really liked W.T.R.F.G. I liked it because it is so exciting because you don't know what will happen and it is such a surprise. Fun because you will get a really good feeling. Lastly thrilling because it makes you persistant.I loved the way Mr.Rawls described the setting. He used such detail, it was like I was with Billy in the Ozark Mountains.I would reccomend this book to a friend or to anyone. The reason why is because I think everyone will love it like I did.This book made me think about true love like Billy had toward his two dogs, persistance for all of the wanting and determination, and what life really means and was like for Billy.This book may be sad because some people get hurt but otherwise it is a great book. Four words to describe it are thrill ride, wonderful, adventure, and fantastic. You really should read it."
5,The best book!!,"I liked this book because it has dogs,people,and,adventure, and if your into those things too, these book is for you. I think the author used imagery the best because, the words were so discriptive that you can get a perfect mental picture. this book made me think about how lucky I am to not be poor,and thankful for cars so we don't have to walk everywhere. I recomend this book to a friend because it is a wonderful thing to help you relized how lucky you are. Although there are some sad and brutal parts in the story,it's a great book. I had a great time reading this book and you will too!"
4,"Good book overall, but kind of sad at the end","I liked this book alot. It was easy to read, and included many details which helped you get to know the main characters in the story very well. You could really understand the characters and how they felt in different situations. It was both sad and happy."
4,a good book i read at school and have read again since,"What remains with me after reading Where The Red Fern Grows is the maturity of the main character, even as a small boy, and the way in which his actions reflect his consideration for others such as members of his family and their welfare. In many ways i think it is a book about growing up and making realizations about what is really important. In some ways,it is a sad book because of its ending, but it is also sad because the experiences the boy has and the difficulties he encounters have a weight that is usually borne by people who are much older than him.In a sense, he is forced to grow up very quickly and leave behind more than just his home-he also leaves his childhood behind."
5,This is a great book for dog lovers.,"This is a book about a boy who saves up for two years to buy a pair of puppies. After he gets the puppies he trains them to hunt for coons never knowing that he has the best hunting dogs in the country. When the puppies are fully trained he has great adventures winning coon hunting contests, until the deadly fight against a mountain lion."
5,WTRFG-Read it Today,"I absolutly loved WTRFG!! It's my favorite book! The story gives way more than a boy and his two dogs. The story also gives a great amount of persistence, loyalty, friendship, and love. I think the author, Wilson Rawls, handled characters best because he gives a great description of each character. This book made me think, ""If I wanted something as much as Billy wanted his dogs, would I work as long and hard to get it as Billy did to get his dogs?"" I would definatly reccomend this book to a frind because it's just a great book! It's a great book because it's very heartwarming. Now go to your local library and check out WTRFG! Trust me, it's a great book!!"
3,So you're debating to read this book or not.........,"We read Where the Red Fern Grows. In the beginning it was slow and boring because it was mostly about hunting, which isn't our favorite subject. But as the story went on it became more about Billy and the love between him and his dogs. If you're the kind of person who determines a book by the first few pages, then I wouldn't recommend it. We thought it was interesting how the dogs were so trustworthy to Billy and to each other. If you would be planning to teach your dog(s) how to hunt, you would learn a lot from this book. We are debating rating it either three stars or four. Overall we'd say it was a pretty good book."
4,Where the Red Fern Grows,I read this book years ago and loved it then and I love it now. I read it in a library and always wanted one of my own.
4,Racoons,This Book was good. I liked it but there was to many racoons well for me at least. First Billy wanted racoon hunting dogs. He gets his hope but thats about to change. In the end it's sad but i'll let you read it for yourself.
4,Billy always catches coons,this book was good.I like how he saves up to get something he wants not bugging his parents for it.I like his dogs there are very good at hunting.so over all i thought this book was good.c.j
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,This book is the best book I have ever read! I love because of the Eastern settining and because I love dogs like Billy.In the beggining Billy wants dogs and he gets them and they have alot of adventures together.MH
5,I think Where the Red Fern Grows is the best!,The Story is incredible! A boy who always wanted a dog raises his own money and walks to a far away town to buy them. It turns out that he bought the best two hunting dogs there was! The end made me cry because I never expected what happened to them! The book is amazing! If you haven't read it believe me it's worth the time!
4,Where Does The Red Fern Grow???,I enjoyed this book very much. The emotions that are undergone make this book even more exciting. This was jump-out-of your seat entertaining! Right here's an awesome example of pure puupy love! Gina and Ebert give it 2 thumbs up!
4,Where The Red Fern Grows,Where The Red Fern Grows is one of the best books I've read.I like it because its about a Billy and his dogs have alot of adventures together and go through alot together.I also like the book because it has alot of secpence and alot of action. I enjoyed the book because I love animals.
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,"In the book where the Red Fern Grows a boy named billy has puppy love.He finds an ad that has a dog advertisment in it and the dogs are 50 dollars(50 dollars ment 1,000 dollars in their time).Billy finally saves up 50 dollars after 2 years and goes in town to get them with out telling his parents.He gets his dogs Old Dan the male and Little Ann the female and he trains them for 2 years then the go hunting and cath their first coon.After a while Billy finds out that Old Dan and Little Ann wouldn`t eat,sleep,or hunt with out each other.After a while they enter a contest and win 2 cups.One night while hunting Old Dan gets killed by a lion and Little Ann later dies of depresion. That was the sad sad part.Just in cause you wanted to know"
3,Where the Red Fern Grows,Reading Where the Red Fern Grows was an experience.At times there were happy times and at times there were sad ones!Out of all the worst part was when Old Dan and Little Ann died.I do reccomend others to read it. Although I dont suggest little ones to read Where the Red Fern Grows because there is a little bit of profanity.Also the book was very entertaining.Also it was some what confusing!Alot of times things were switching back and forth.I do have to say that Where the Red Fern Grows the book has alot more detail then the movie.I also hope anyone reading it or reads it enjoys Where the Red Fern Grows!! 4ADA
4,"Exciting, happy, and sad","I think that Where the Red Fern Grows was a great book. Billy wanted those two hunting hounds so much. I don't think I've ever wanted anything that bad. His family was too poor to get him the hounds so he worked and earned all the money for the dogs. That is what I call determination. When he got the dogs he trained them and they were the best in the country. His grandpa took him to a Championship Coon Hunt, which Billy won the Gold Cup and the Jack Pot. Billy and the dogs always went hunting and had a lot of fun. Near the end a tradgedy happens which was very sad. But at the end it all works out and they move to town so that they can have a good education and life. ..."
3,Billy and his dogs get in and out of trouble.,"The Red Fern Grows was a thrilling epic in which Billy the main character scrimped and saved to buy 2 coon hounds they were the best coon hunters in the Oasarks prouved it many times , won money so Billy and his famly could move to town,and made the ultimate sacrifice for Billy."
4,It was a good book,This was one of the best books I have read. I used to have some of my own dogs like him. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it. It was one of the books that is kind of sad. It was the sadest books anyone could read. The boy saves money to buy some dogs of his own. He walks all the way to get them. He takes them in to the woods to go coon hunting.K.L.
5,Where the red fern grows,"It is a great book! I liked it a lot. at the end it made people cry, because the dogs died. I admit I almost cried. This the best book you`ll ever read.it Is about two dogs and there owner named Billy he really wanted some coon hunting dogs. He would dream of having dogs. so he saved money to buy some. they costed $50.00. It took 2 yars to get $50.00 but he got it.His dogs were beautiful. He went hunting with them every night well almost every night. Once they one a coon hunting contest and got a big golden cup. there names were Little Ann and Old Dan. At the contest Little Ann One a doggy Beauty pagent. But one night when they were hunting. they got attacked by a mountain lion and they died. I encouredge you to red this book because It`s heartpounding."
3,Where The Red Fern Grows,"I am going to be telling you about my favorite part. My favorite part is when little Ann got lost. My favorite character is little Ann. Little Ann is so small, smart,and vicious. I wish my dog was like Little Ann. I like Little Ann because we seem alike. We seem alike because we are both visious. I am not small, but we still seem alike. The way that they discribe her in the book she sounds pretty. Little Ann is a smart dog. Billy's other dog is Old Dan. Old Dan is bigger than Little Ann, but he is not smarter than her. I really like Litte Ann. Little Ann is also more playfull than Old Dan. Old Dan is serious. Old Dan and Little ann are both red. I liked this book."
2,Boaring,I didn't enjoy this book very much. I found it to be very boaring . Other readers may like this book but it didn't grab intrest. This book is mostly an adventure book. So if you like adventure you'll enjoy this book.
5,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I think this book was splendid! The author makes you visiualize the whole story. Billy is a ten year old boy who has a terrible sickness (puppy love). When he finally gets his dogs,he trains them to hunt.His hunting answers prayers.-(#20)"
5,Where the red fern grows,Beloved book I first read over 30 years ago and rediscovered when it was assigned to my child's English class. The movie does NOT do the book justice.
5,"Great book, great service",Many thanks to SL Herbert for prompt service and good product. Am filling in a class set of this wonderful story. Classic story of a boy and his dogs and loyalty.
4,Where the Red Fern Groes,After reading the other reviews I noticed that Billy did have some crying problem. But that doesn't way out the good things about the book like the message about persistance is rewarded wich it should be in life but that about never happens any more. Some other things I liked were that the dogs cared about Billy and vise versa by the ways that Billy did live up to is word. Over all I liked the book and thought that much of it was true about how dogs and boys act together. I would reckemend it to any one that likes hunting
3,I think this is a great book.,"I recommend this book to a kid in 5th or 6th grade that wants a dog. That is why I like this book. Some good things that I like were when he went to town to get a dog. He was going to buy a small beagle, but these kids bought him before he got to it. This book is about a boy that wants a coon dog. The exciting part of this book was when he tried to tree the ghost coon, he's the oldest coon.He got his own side of his dad's shed wall. By the he competed, he had the whole wall full of coon skins. I really enjoyed this book."
5,"My oppinian of ""Where the Red fern Grows""",This books deserves 5 stars because it was an awsome book. It had many detals and plenty of elaboration. It also had life long lessons in it. It taught me that what you give is what you get and to always persevere to get what you want. I really enjoyed the reality in this book. It had real problems that many people have had to deal with it. I also really liked the morals of the story. Wilson Rawls wrote one of the best books i have ever read. 5HBB
4,A great tale of love and adventure!,"'Where the Red Fern Grows' is a story that appeals to all ages. It combines humor, love of dogs, and adventure in a exicting plot!"
3,red fern,"I think this book was a good book because it was about dogs and i like dogs. In the book a kid named billy saves money for dogs when he gets the dogs he trains them to be hunting dogs they become really good friends and they go places together,but in the end alot of bad things happen.LM"
4,where the red fern grows,Where The Red Fern Grows is one of the best books i've read. It is a great book because the action and the drama all in one book. After I read this book i was suprised how good it was.
5,A timeless classic.,I love this book. I just love the story of the little ten year old boy who was puppy sick. And how with God help in two years he was able to buy those expensive dogs. My fave part was where he was walking home withe the dogs in the bag with heir cute little heads hanging out. So Cute!
5,Where the red Fern grows,The reason I picked the 5 rating for it is because my dad read it and said it was really good and we both love this book
5,review of where the red fern grows,it was an awsome and exciting book.i cried tears of joy and tears of sadness.you will love this book just like all my other classmates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
4,where the red fern grows,This book is great because the author described the main subjects and people. He had wonderful adjectives. It was sad and funny at the same time.If I were you I would rate it a 10.
1,TOO SAD - A TEAR JERKER,"My son had to read this book for class, and he really didn't like it. He said it was too sad at the end. He mostly liked the book, but the ending ruined the story."
1,Where the Red Fern Grows,Where the Red Fern Grows is a very long book about a boy who wants two coon hounds he won't be satisfied with just one but wants two. He has to raise the money on his own because is family has no money to even buy a new mule so they certainly don't have money to buy two hounds for a boy. The boy must wait for two years before he finally has all the money raised. When he gets his dogs he wants to make them the best that they can be. I really didn't like the book and though the ways that they went upon stuff was fairly poor. I wouldn't recommend this book because I thought it was a stinky book.
1,?,"Although receiving wonderful reviews, I read it and I hated it. I didn't even read the whole book! I've heard it has much beauty and greatness, but to me, it was the most tedious book I've ever read."
1,Why billy cryed,The story talked a lot about billy crying .There were a few really good parts .If you like to be in a bad mood this story is best for you because there are a lot of dogs and people dieing and crying boo hoo.This story really stunk.
1,Where The Red Fern Shouldn't Grow by: sAnDiEmArZu,"I didn't like this book because it was too old fashioned for me. It reminds me of the book called ""Ol' Yeller"". The main character, Billy, was a little too mushy. In every chapter he cried!! It was unbelievable!! In this book it said that he had a bad case of ""puppy love"". That's for sure! I also don't like this book because it has to do with hunting and I think that hunting is harsh and cruel."
4,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I am in school and Red Fern was part of the curriculum this year. It is a wonderful tale of excitement, luck, skill, and sadness. I would recommend this book to anyone. Trust me, you will really enjoy this unforgettable story."
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,"In sixth grade I was introduced to this wonderful book. My teacher would read part of it to us everyday. We all became so engrossed with this story, that by the end, all of us had tears in our eyes. This is a beautiful, sad, wonderful tale of a boy and his dogs. I recommend that everyone, young and old, read this book."
5,"""Where the Red Fern Grows""-A powerful and moving book!","""Where the Red Fern Grows"" is a book about a young boy named Billy who loves dogs and coon hunting. Living in the Ozark Mountains, he has always wanted two coon hounds. However, he has never gotten them because his family is poor. One summer he gets the determination to go out and earn enough money to buy himself two coon hounds.When he finally gets the two hounds, he names them Little Ann and Old Dan. Billy goes out and hunts with them every night to make them the best and he ends up entering them in a contest. In the end, a fatal accident occurs while Billy is hunting that will leave you in tears.This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It is a story of determination,love, and bravery. It is also a very detailed and descriptive book filled with similes, metaphors, and personification. I loved this book and I'm sure you would too. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age."
5,Great for all ages,"I teach fourth grade and have already read this book to both of my classes this year. I can honestly say that all of the children were touched by this amazingly beautiful story of friendship and love. It's a great book to use as comparison with the movie. It showed my students that there is more to good entertainment than sitting and watching the television all day. They realized that using the imagination and getting lost in a good book can be just as entertaining if not more so. I also used this book in a second grade classroom and children at that young age were just as deeply touched. I recommend this book to people of all ages, children and adults alike."
5,Where the red fern grows,"I liked this book & I would strongly suggest it because it'sinteresting. Even though its fiction the author put some of his real-life experiences in it which makes it more interesting!Where The Red Fern Grows is about a boy that works hard and saves his money for 2 years to get 2 hounds that his parents couldn't afford at the time.But after some time tragedy strikes,which gets Billy down even though he doesn't get it at first later he finds out it happened for his good!"
5,Spellbinding!!!,"I read this book about a month ago and literally cried at the end. Even though I am more of a science fiction and fantasy guy, this book is my favorite. Hands down. This is definitley one of those books where when your finished with it you will be going around talking about it for a week. Intriguing, grasping, and just plain fenominal."
5,A book for every one. It is an overall great book!,This book is an all time classic. It's for almost all ages. I wouldn't recomend it for 6 and under.
4,This was a great boook for all ages.,"This was a heart touching book that kept me on the edge of my seat! It's a quick read with only 249 pages. The only problem in this book, was that i felt the boy, Billy, was to feminine. He would cry often, but i guess coming from a girl, that thats what every girl want, a guy that in touch with his fellings. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a heartwarming tales of happiness, and sorrow."
5,A Satifactional Book For Kids,"I loved W.T.R.F.G. Mr. Rawls was very descriptive in his writing. I love books like that! I also like it where he makes me cant wait to see what happens next. I think Rawls handled his element of imagery extremely well in this story. In almost every sentence he was apealing to the five senses. This book made me think about responsobility and its meaning. To me its that you fulfill to contribute to your responsobility. Like Billy would feed his dogs, hunt with his dogs, and exercises his dogs almost every day. I would recommend this book to a friend because they could also find a moral lesson in this story. If you want to grow up to be a strong, loving, and caring person, then you..... SHOULD READ THIS BOOOK!!!"
4,When the Red Fern Grows,I Gave this book a four because it is adventureous and it is one of the best books I have ever read. This book is about a young boy who really wants some coon hunting dogs. And he finally earns them from doing hard labor for two years! he soons trains them and enters a coon hunting contest and the rest is for you to read.By: Z.P
3,Why did you read this,I liked the book. It was pretty well plotted in some points but some wernt that good. The book is about a boy how wants to buy some hunting dogs( two hounds). He works for his grandpa an collects crawdads for the fisher man he does that for two years. He hased to go get his dogs by going to Tahlequah. Then later in the story he gows to a gianted coon hunt. He wins some how but thats for you to figure out. But at the end something sad happens and hase to move.DDM
4,Why Me,"I would say that this book was realy good. In the book there was this kid that wanted a dog realy bad. So he worked for it he put a lot of eford in to it, also he praded. Soon he got his wish and he got some coon hounds (two). In the mixed he interd them in a coon hound compitishon but I will not tell you what the out come is. At the end it is very tragik if you whant to know what hapened you will have to read this book.AG"
5,Old Yeller,"I thought this book was great because it had a dog and an adventure. This book is about a dog and a family that lives in the country side. In the story at first Travis, the owner, doesn't like Old Yeller. As time goes by he starts liking him. Old Yeller and Travis did alot of things together. The end was very sad. So, if you need an exciting book you should get the book Old Yeller."
2,This book is okay,I didnt really like this book. This book was very perdictable. The boy Billy whanted a Redbone Hound so he saves up. He buys them and trains them to be good hunting dogs. Then they win a hunting chaleng. The ending is sad.
5,Where the Red Fern Grows book review,Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls shows a different era then what today's classrooms are exposed to. The book takes place back in the early 1900's. It teaches students how to feel and pick up on their surroundings. It teaches responsibility and how to handle grief at a young age. This is the perfect book for a child that is in a transition to more higher order thinking. I would recommend this book for lessons on morals and the loyalty.
3,Glad I read it.,"In my quest to read some ""classics"", I chose this book. It was ok, probably my age (41) that made it not so fantastic, but I can see why it was a classic. I watched the movie right after and was surprised at how much they changed the movie from the book. Read the book, its much better!"
1,DON'T USE THESE MUFFS IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEARING!,"I have no idea how they received the noise reduction rating that they did asthey do not even cover my ears properly. The first time I used them, I hadto leave the firing line at the first shot as I was nearly deafened. I donot have weirdly shaped ears.Not recommended!"
2,This is a very incomplete dictionary,We live in the Dominican Replubic and this dictionary did not contain many of the words we need to communicate or read the newspaper. Even our Spanish teacher found it was incomplete.
4,Report on classroom use.,"This portable dictionary is useful for first and second year students working at their desks, but should be supplemented in the classroom by a more comprehensive resource."
2,Very incomplete dictionary,I got this because it's compact and lightweight but it is lightweight in every sense of the word. Get a different dictionary. I know I will.BTW do not use Bookholders!! They are dishonest and will rip you off!!!
5,Good recap of what syntax is under tree diagram,"This book has a well formed summary of each section that the author wrote about.and after each explanation of new terms, it provides you examples that you can try out along with the answers at the back of the book.Furthermore, it has a summary of the rules that are available for at the end of each chapter.Great book as a refresher to syntax.honestly, it presented information that was better than my professor's lecture.also its an easy read, (only if you are not forced to read it)definitely recommend it.if any syntax professors are looking at my comment, please consider it. I'm sure the student will find this book very VERY useful (that is as long as the terminology that you use line up with the book)"
4,Aqua Lube lived up to its promise. There ...,"Aqua Lube lived up to its promise. There was no unpleasant odor, taste, or color. It wasn't sticky and felt very natural."
3,"This product is long lasting, like it says. ...","This product is long lasting, like it says. But what I didn't like about it is that it smells like coconut sunscreen, and it feels sticky."
2,Lousy Customer Service,"I was very pleased with the product for the first year and after that it became difficult to unwind the hose, plus, water ran out the exit hose when handle in REST position. It has a two year warranty and so I called the company and they agreeded to send a part they thought would fix it. After five weeks and repeated phone calls, faxes, and e-mail, still no part. Now they won't even answer the customer service phone # at 1-866-493-7638. So, I have a $70.00 flower pot holder."
3,"It works, but it uses a lot of water","The reel works as it's supposed to, but unless you've seen it in action you may not realize that it uses quite a bit of water in order to wind up the hose. This water is released through a drain hose, which the manufaturer suggests you use to water nearby plants. That's not a bad idea, but in my case that's not possible so the water ends up running down a concrete path to the sidewalk, which is a waste. This will not be a problem for most people with a regular yard with lawn and planting beds, but if you're in a more urban setting (in my case, an old rowhouse) or need to keep the reel in a paved area, you should think about the fact that you'll be doing the equivalent of leaving a hose on full blast for a couple of minutes while the reel does its thing."
3,Comes up a little short......,"Not that this item is all bad, but the ""claimed"" 100 feet of hose really only addresses about 90 feet of it before it stops rewinding! The problem is that it doesn't wrap the hose smoothly and evenly as it is retracting it so it can't accept all 100 feet of hose. And mine is sitting on level ground w/ the provided stakes in place to hold it in position. It would work great if you have a shorter hose to use! I do recommend it; just not for 100 foot lengths of hose!"
1,Disappointed,"The concept is great but the hose reel does not work. First tried a heavy duty 100 foot hose which would not rewind. Then changed to a lightweight 50 foot hose but it still didn't work. A lot of water was wasted trying to rewind the hose. The hose reel is also cheaply made of plastic which can be broken easily. The hose gun holder also would not attach properly to the base. I expected better, especially given the expense. This hose reel is going back, and I will get a hand crank one instead."
5,Hose Reel,Excellent product. Rolling up hose is a snap now. Price is great.You will not be disappointed in this procuct.
1,Clunker...,I've owned this unit for nearly a year and I'm replacing it with a Rapid Reel. I thought this would be the ultimate convenient reel but several problems have changed my opinion. From day one the unit would clunk as the hose was removed and I also noticed a decrease in water pressure while using this reel. Recently the reel has started to bypass water when I'm watering the garden. A small hose on the reel dumps water as the rewinding mechanism operates. Now I've got water coming out this small drain line whether it's rewinding or I'm using the garden hose. I give up! Just not the quality product I was hoping for.No Crank Classic 100' Water Powered Retractable Garden Hose Reel #RS10001
3,Works but could be better,"The hose reel works as advertised for me but I have 2 concerns. One minor one is the water it uses (not too much you can do about that). The second and a major complaint is that it is hard to unreel, it keeps pulling out of the ground stakes. I would prefer it put into a wall with lag bolts. My wife hates it but I like the fact that I don't have to manually reel it in."
5,Time Saver,"This is a great product.take time to properly set it up and it will work great.now made by another company and doesnt look as nice as this one, but hopefully will work as good."
2,Horrible Customer Service,"Like other reviewers, I had a small part on the reel break. Instead of selling replacement parts at local dealers, the company claims they will send you replacements for free ($5 shipping). I sent them a check 6 months ago, have called and emailed multiple times, and still no part. If they sold these parts locally, I would still be able to use the reel. Instead, they are forcing customers to buy new reels when the small plastic parts break. I don't appreciate this sort of false advertising nor do I appreciate being forced to spend another $90 when it should only cost me $5 to fix their bad product design. I would recommend buying another company's product to send a message to this company to stop their false advertising."
5,Florence Foster Jenkins for the Early Music crowd,"First of all, make no mistake about it--Nella Anfuso is a TERRIBLE singer, especially for the early baroque music in which she specializes. Approximate pitch, poor breath support, and a slow, wide vibrato are all hallmarks of her voice, and Caccini's prescribed ornaments are both incorrectly applied and incompetently executed. As someone who genuinely loves this music, I should be disgusted and offended... and yet listening to this recording is like watching a car crash: I can't turn away, and whenever I think it cannot get any worse, I am proved wrong. The ""critical acclaim"" and ""musicological expertise"" with which Madame Anfuso praises her own work just add to the luster of a woman who believes in her own talent and artistry against all odds."
2,Some of Disney's Worst Decisions,"I might have liked the first song if during the movie it hadn't seemed to drag on and on. All of the songs felt too long during the movie and frankly they kind of ruined the show for me. I dropped an entire star from my movie rating just because of the music. I like Phil Colins alright I guess, but his music seemed out of place and cheesy."
2,The sad downfall of disney,"This soundtrack is an example how music, what had been for many years the keystone to disney films, has now become of negligible importance.Employing such artists as phil collins and tina turner to preform songs in the films, rather than have characters themselves sing weakens the storyline. An animated musical, what disney films are, needs to have the songs sung by the characters.To put aside for a moment the weak lyrics, the very basic orchestrated pieces, and the over use of brass instruments in conjunction with tradition native american instruments, the songs carry no emotion. They do not create fear, love, hate or saddness.These songs cause no desire for anyone to sing them again to remind themselves of the film.With hope this will not be the future of disney musical pieces and things will improve."
4,Phil's Disney Magic,"""Brother Bear"" Phil Collins second work with Disney. ""Tarzan"" the first was an excellent album. This album isn't quite as good but still is an excellent collection as Phil writes and collaborates with such artists as Tina Turner, The Bulgarian Women's Choir, Blind Boys Of Alabama, Oren Waters, Mark Mancina & Chris Montan. Some excellent songs on this album, highlighted by the track ""No Way Out""(Theme From Brother Bear)...other highlights include ""On My Way"" and the album's first single ""Look Through My Eyes"". Once again I think Phil has found a good audience with children in this soundtrack. Adult fans of Phil should find something to like with this album as well. Phil has long left his pop roots behind...but nevertheless he is still a powerful songwriter and these songs go to prove that."
2,Average,"I really enjoyed the TARZAN soundtrack and the BROTHER BEAR movie, so I was expecting to like this CD as well. But the most surprising thing about the soundtrack is how unmemorable it is. The biggest elements missing from this music are energy and excitement. They all just seem to hang in the air like heavy blobs. Only ""Welcome"" stands out as a memorable tune - something that you might find yourself singing around the house. I was excited about the use on Inuit on a few of the tracks. It's surprising how flat these tracks sound considering what an interesting sounding language it is. Alll in all a non-distinctive effort.If you buy the CD at a Disney Store or a Disney Park, you can get the soundtrack with a limited edition 3D cover."
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO PHIL COLLINS??? HE USED TO BE SO GOOD!!,"IN A WORD: HORRIBLE!!!I SIMPLY CANNOT BELIEVE HOW KORNY, LAME, CONTRIVED, BORING, AND MELODICALLY WEAK THIS CD IS.IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THE TARZAN SOUNDTRACK!!! (if you can swallow that)I have been a fan of his music for over 15 years, so I know what he is capable of--and this is GARBAGE.The album's songs go absolutely nowhere, and were not well written at all.The only decent trax are the instrumental score pieces.I can't believe that this is the same man who wrote ""Face value"", & ""hello I must be going"", and all that great Genesis stuff....It is so sad that he lost his talent, his edge, & most importantly: his SENSE OF MELODY."
5,Love the movie... love the sountrack...,"The music is incredible, deep and I love this Soundtrack! :)It's a perfect combination of music, lyrics and a good message."
5,Wonderful,"This CD has absolutely wonderful tracks, voices, and sentiments all in one place. The songs are age appropriate to the movie, yet enjoyable for all ages. A true classic."
2,"Same old, same old",These are the same old songs that are on all the other Disneyworld cd's. Why pay these prices when you can buy something much cheaper and newer that has the same songs! I have four different cd's from the park with all the same songs on them.
4,Wow! Prety Nice!,This CD was great! It had all the cool songs from the park! Like Splash Mountain! And the Tower of terror! Why not have this cd?
5,Brought back memories,"The book arrived quickly and in good shape for a very well used book. I had been looking for a particular song from this book, which I used to have but lost many years ago. It brought back many memories as I played through the pieces. What surprised me even more was the library card at the back of the book from my old Alma Mater. I don't know, but am pretty sure I was one of the users of this very book from our music library. Talk about memories!"
5,Real stories about real people,"This is a great book about an amazing place: Rockaway Beach. Remember the guy who told Osama bin Laden to kiss his royal Irish a**? He's from Rockaway? One of the firefighters who raised the flag at Ground Zero in that famous picture? From Rockaway. One of the first firefighters killed on 9/11? Rockaway again.There's no ""hero fatigue"" in this book because it's not just another canned book about a well known tragedy. The people are too real. The writer has too good an ear for the way these people talk, which makes them come alive. I really cared about them by the end of the book.It'll tear your heart out but it will make you laugh like hell too. Filled with colorful stories and great characters. Outstanding."
1,Political thrash,"Troops of Tomorrow has a crisp, clean guitar sound, and the lyrics are a bit easier to understand, but the improved production doesn't mean the Exploited has gotten slick-the rough and tumble assault is still unstoppable. The title track was written by the Vibrators and ""Sid Vicious Was Innocent"" is one of the record's more interesting arguments."
5,A good Intoduction to the Life of Lord Nelson,"If you want a good but not indepth look at one of Englands Great Fighting Admirals. Then you should consider looking at this film. As Nelson rightfully should be considered a great case study in Effective Leadership. I was hoping that this film would go more into detail about the Nelson ""touch"" but I was disappointed as this film did an almost there. Hopefully, something better will come down the road for his Lordship."
4,Interesting,Not what I expected but was pleasantly surprised. Different funky beats make it nice to lounge to.
5,The Funnyest Pig Book Ever,"Delightful and very funny. Wodehouse's pig books are not quite up to the Jeeves books but for a Wodehouse fan they are a must. I especially like old uncle Galahad and wish that he played a bigger role, reminds me, funnily enough, of Lavanam in the book Drop Dead Gorgeous by A E Thorogood. Be that as it may this book is a winner, highly recomended."
3,Not a bad little camera,"This isn't a bad camera for taking simple pictures outside or inside. I have made many great pictures with it without wasting film from a regular camera. The drawbacks are 1) if you use the flash the pictures comes out almost completely washed out and if it's dark so that you need a flash, you ain't gonna get the picture you want; 2) there's no LCD display so you don't know what your picture looks like until you get home to download it on the computer; 3) you can't tell how much memory is left to know how many more pictures you can take before downloading. I got this camera as a gift. I have no idea what it cost."
4,Don't be so hard on this freebie,"I have been using this little camera (also free with a PC purchase) and have had 0 problems with it. Obviously, it's a 1.3MP camera, so what kind of quality do you think you're getting? For a novice digital camera person taking non-action shots, this is fine. I have been very pleasantly surprised at the quality of outdoor shots (indoor shots turn out okay, but close-ups are poor quality - don't use that feature, a button on the side). The size is one of the best features of it - it's tiny! I can take 30 pics at a time, and since I always have a laptop close by, so downloading these and clearing the cache is no problem for me. The software installs really easily, and the interface is very user-friendly. It takes AAA batteries which is great. There's no viewer, but this is still a good value unit. [I would say it's easily worth about $50-$60]"
1,Don't waste your time,I received this free with a PC purchase. The pictures it takes are so bad even my 8 year old daughter is embarassed to email them out. I'm currently trying to think of someone I dislike enough to give it to.
5,Sterling catches up to Stephenson and Gibson,"Since the beginnings of cyberpunk, variations by various authors have tried putting the sci-fi back into Cyberpunk. In Holy Fire, Sterling manages to get the almost drug-induced strangeness of Stephenson for a scene or two, yet portrays a future based solidly in the events of today that is reminiscent of a modern era 1984. His characters are interesting and off-beat, but show a good bit of insight into the society of the future. The first 50 pages show the world as a terrifying future. The plot for the remainder of the book is good, but doesn't live up to the world that it portrays. His attempts at classical symbolism are interesting and intentional and thus humorous. The meaning that lies thinly veiled is an obvious warning to our generation. Perhaps we should listen before we reach his perhaps-too-distant future."
4,Bruce Sterling's Aged Future,"Once again Bruce Sterling takes a look into his skewed crystal ball and offers us a glimpse of possibilities. Firmly set in a future manipulated by ""gerontocrats"", he shows how the practice of medicine has become the GNP of the day. The story revolves around a ""gerontocrat"" who undergoes a medical transformation into a youthful member of the oppressed. Rather than remain the guinea pig of the gerontocrats, she runs and begins her own Wanderjar. And that's just the beginning. Makes you think twice about your health and the coming changes to the demographics of today"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A realised version of the old people are boring meme. Rejuvenationtreatments are available to those that can afford them, and these leadto, of course, those very elderly being in control through wealth andinfluence. They tend to lead static, safe, placid lives to protecttheir investment in themselves.So, any change can only come through the young who avoid any of theexisting technology. Here, one of the former group crosses to thelatter, slumming to some degree."
3,Young Again,"Holy Fire-Is a book about age, and power. It is placed in the future and the elderly are in control. Mia Ziemann is one of these wealthy elderly people who control this society and have all the insight to the technology of the day. Mia is 94 years old and lives in the 21st century; she has lived her life very cautiously, never being too adventurous.Mia meets an old friend/lover who is on his deathbed. This experience changed her outlook on life. Could there be a chance she could change who she is? How much would it cost her? This brings Mia to the realization that maybe she has been too careful, too unadventurous throughout her life. So now she must escape a team of medical keepers to the underground escaping her life. She then must go trough a very painful procedure that would make her young again. She will enter a false world, a false reality that is just hooked up to a network of computers, in this world is Holy Fire this is a drug that may change all human life forever."
2,Wait for this novel in the 1/2 price used book store,"Like Gibson's ""Idoru"", Sterling's ""Holy Fire"" seriously needs some holy fire. What is this? Some post 20 century angst-soap opera-see Europe travel romp with a slap of the old cyberpunk paint brush?The innovations in this novel are far and few (enhanced talking dogs - nice touch) - the rejuvenation technique(s) almost a trival pretext for what seems to be a post-20th century remake of a Nathanel Hawthorne story: old person becomes young person and goes on European rutting expedition.I almost have the feeling Sterling is pandering to a certain politically correct crowd. Save your money and buy this novel in paperback at the 1/2 price book store."
2,Interesting concept lacking follow-through.,"Just finished this one and was left with the feeling that half the text could have been omitted without hurting the story-line. I really did like the concept of the book, but was disappointed that it got lost. A book about Holy Fire shouldn't lose it. This one does."
2,Disappointing,"Holy fire is the second book I had read by Sterling and now my opinion of Sterling is in question. Heavy Weather by the same author was definitely in the area of 4 stars, while this book paled into insignificance by comparison.This book seemed to meander and stop and meander some more as though the author was just trying to fill the pages. The central character even had no vision or goal set and I think this was where the book failed in my opinion. There was no goal. There was little challenge and there was no ambition to the character.I kept hoping that there was going to be some massive revelation around the corner and instead it just fizzled out at the end.I was disappointed, but went into this book expecting to love or hate it based upon other reviews that I read before buying it."
2,Get young and bum around Europe,"Overall the idea of turning into a young person again when nearly at the twilight of your life is perhaps the dream of everyone, yet when Maya gets this chance it seems she doesnt do anything with it.The book started out strong with her escaping to find her own way but quickly the book lost its way and just like the main character just kept wandering back and forth.This to me is too bad as I normally consider this author very strong in his writing but I get the feeling he just want sure what to do with this so he kept writing and writing till the book was filed."
4,good stuff,"Well this is the first book bu Bruce sterling i read. it was assigned to as a part of my literature class at the local community college. it was a good book. it is set in the future where old people are the richest and have all the power, and those who could afford it could live longer lives thanks to life extension procedures. The main character is an old lady named Mia who has spent her whole life being cautious and never lived her life to the ""fullest"" Mia realises that her life sucked and went in for a radical procedure that made her young again. but she was under strict observation, she fled to europe and had meet alot of people as she tries new thing she had never experienced before. good read not alot of science fiction to confuse the heck out of no one,."
1,Zzzzzzz,"Too long, boring plot (near zero drama), peppered with numerous implausibilities from the school of sci-fi writing that thinks it can throw in whatever utopian, hair-brained idea it likes (almost at random) without regard to context or economic plausibility. Bleah. Three stars for concept, minus two for draining the life from it."
2,"Holy Fire: Too Much Smoke, Not Enough Light","I wonder why I continue to purchase Bruce Sterling's books. This is a good example of a second-rate work of science fiction that has achieved its prominence by riding on the coat-tails of the author's earlier work. Holy Fire is in dire need of new, novel ideas; Sterling merely rehashes old themes and concepts that have achived prominence through other writers' efforts. The concept of talking cyborg dogs has, for instance, been much better done in short stories such as Ron Goulart's classic ""Prez.""This book fails largely in two areas. First, characters were only given the most shallow descriptions. Second, the Mia's introspective processes were poorly explained and barely explored, a significant weakness in view of the book's focus on the tumoil of inner life in the age of synthetic utopia.In summary, this boring and disappointing book ultimately goes nowhere."
2,Didn't Read Instructions,"The people this basket was sent to received it, but never received the thank you note that was attached to it so they had no idea who this was from! We are very disappointed in this."
1,A lousy imitation,"If you want the songs on this CD that were done by the ""original"" Drifters--THEN SAVE YOUR MONEY--'cause this ain't them. This is no ""Magic Moment"". It's more like ""There Goes My Money"""
3,hello and goodbye,"Desgraciadamente creo que no pasaron la prueba del tiempo.Una propuesta que se doblega y que no pasa como un deseo de insertarse en una moda muy pasajera.Grupo de un par de, bueno, tal vez tres canciones y el resto totalmente predecible e insulso, sin ninguna propuesta importante, simplemente es un grupo como tantos que si bien tuvieron sus 5 minutos de gloria, no aportaron nada a nadie.Totalmente rebasados por la realidad."
2,disapointed. you dont get what you pay for.,"Bought these after 2 hours of debate. love the looks but they are beyond cheaply made. the sole nubs mind as well not be there at the rate they fall off the shoes. i truely wish i could give them a better rating, but you get no bang for the buck at all. they wouldnt be have bad if your only intentions was to look at em...yup not very durable though, just my .02im still in debate on wether or not ill give sketchers a second chance.companies seam to forget that they are selling more than just a product..."
3,The shoes look great but slightly uncomfortable.,"The shoes look great but I do feel it needs a bit of more cushion at the bottom. If you walk a bit in these shoes your heels start to hurt a bit, a little bit of more cushion would have been great. Probably I can put in a comfortable in sole to get around the issue. Apart from that the shoe look great and holding up well."
2,"Comfortable, but not durable.","The little rubber studs on the bottom of these started breaking offafter only a few weeks of wearing them. They were not abused in anyway, just a bad tread design. They are however, extremely comfortable."
1,Nice look. POOR QUALITY :(,Loved the look and were comfortable at first...The little Things on the Bottom began to fall off and so over time Ankles and Shins were taking on damage. Comfortable as an around the House Slipper but that would make these a fairly Expensive Slipper in my book! Pass!
5,My favorite skechers,"I really like the Skecher's sneaker line. Minimalist (relatively speaking), sleek, and with elegant lines. The biggest problem I've had with Skechers is comfort and wear. Some tend to wear out very quickly and/or become uncomfortable.These have been most comfortable pair (in black) I've owned and I've owned at least 5-6 different styles of Skechers. And to top it off they are holding up really well after 5-6 years. I highly recommend."
4,musical instruments to make,"Like the book very much. Am in the process of making instruments from this book. However, price for this book is much to high for the value of information. Price in twenty to thirty dollar range is okay, any higher, save your money."
5,Very pleased,My son had to make a musical instrument for school but couldn't decide what to make. Cool Cardboard Instruments to Make and Play arrived within 3 working days and he was able to choose something different and easy to make. He got an A+ from his teacher and a big hug from me.
5,The greatest hockey book ever written,"Ken Dryden has written was many would say as the greatest hockey book ever written. Written during the latter stages of his career he reflects and gives insights on some of the greatest hockey legends that we have ever seen - Scotty Bowman, Guy Lefleur, Steve Shutt, Bobby Orr and others. Any hockey fan would appreciate what he writes, something he does better than almost anyone else!"
5,One of my favorite books,"I was not alive in 70s, so I only knew vague facts about Dryden- namely, that he was a legendary goalie- and even less about the Canadiens. I picked this book up because I'm a hockey fan and wanted to read ""the greatest hockey book ever written."" I was not disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Rather than a typical athlete's ""I was the best and here's why,"" The Game is a wonderful portrait of Dryden's last season. He lets the reader into the locker room and shows not a group of some of the greatest players ever, but rather a group of normal men with enormous talent but all too human insecurities."
2,Scotland Yard Outlook of Hockey,"When I saw this book I said to myself I will give it a try-- After reading parts about the conversations in the locker rooms between players. I liked his own history about the game when growing up and the teams day to day conversations--going to practice, before certain big games. But he has a nasty annoying knack of disrespecting other players on any page in the book. The first read of the book you think it is just great sense of humor, but afterwards I think about and it is a tremendous disrespect to other professional players on his team. An example includes page 110 ""The one original part of his game around which it might be done he seemed anxious to deny."" Page 77 ""On the one hand he is a good skater and forechecker, capable of playing any of the forward positions, a better-than-average playmaker and penalty-killer;on the other, he is not big,not strong, not tough, often injured, a worse-than-average shooter, and has surprisingly little goal-scoring ability."
3,I really wanted to like it,"One word ""Dry"". I tried to like this book. I really tried to like this book. I am sorry, I just can't. Everyone always say that this is the best hockey books ever written. Some say one of the best sports books ever written. I just don't see it. To that I must say that there just must not be any competition for it. I give it a 3 of 5 because I don't hate it. I guess I don't understand it. I recommend you get it and see for yourself it's a classic and worth your time."
2,Booooooooring,"I have no idea what people like about this book. I'm a huge hockey fan. I grew up in Montreal in the '70s -- I LOVE the Canadiens - especially of that era. But this book is powerfully bland. Stupendously vanilla. Ostentatiously uninteresting. I agree with the reviewer Zeiler -- I wanted to like this book. But, I don't care that Dryden felt ""liberated"" roaming the streets of the Village in New York, or that Doug Riseborough was a truly ""nice"" guy. Ugh. If you want a great sports book, read Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four"". At least it opened your eyes to the underbelly of baseball. Dryden is a lawyer and it's written like a lawyer would write -- there's nothing here anyone would object to, so he had no fear of being sued!"
2,Irritating democracy,"2 1/2Somehow this clattering industrial and primitive post-rock manages to stay just left of boredom, though never right of engaging."

3,Teenage angst or Attention Deficit Disorder,"It seemed more like Attention Deficit Disorder or some other mental disease to me. This appeared to be confirmed at the end when he was in the psychiatric hospital. I didn't feel the teenage angst and rebellion. It seemed Holden had his mind made up about his feelings towards every aspect of everything, although sometimes those feelings wavered a bit.I'm glad I read it. I had always been curious about it. However, I didn't really like it. It was difficult reading for me, simply too scattered and all over the place to hold my attention.There were some humorous observations made by Holden and I did get a few chuckles reading it, but I fail to see what all the fuss is about. It was middle of the road to me and nothing more. It wasn't particularly gripping - I could put it down and I did put it down, multiple times, and I didn't particularly look forward to picking it up again.I borrowed this book from the Wichita Public Library."
4,Not so bizarre..,"Once again what was strange to 17th century audiences isn't so unusual to us. However, these pieces do contain a few pleasant surprises and are a little different to those from the usual mould. The sounds are familiar, but there are sudden stops and starts and progressions don't always develop as anticipated.Perhaps it's because these solitary pieces lack standard form that one doens't know what to expect next on first hearing. Not so distinctive as, say, Couperin's chamber music, but still interesting and reasonably accessible."
5,Awsome! (for the price),"For $300, THIS IS AWSOME! The + are: 20x zoom, USB connection, Effects, Titles, Lights, Small price, Nightshot plus, Stereo sound. The - are: Low lighting inside without all lights on, Low picture quality without computer editing. You can also play back video on your TV. Hope this review was usefull"
5,THIS MODEL DOES NOT play old 8mm or Hi-8 at all. Plays digital-8 fine.,I bought it to play my old tapes. It does not. I should have read up on this model. Still I will not return it because it is not the sellers fault. Five stars because it does what it was meant to do. I should have read up on this before buying it.
4,Nice inexpensive camcorder,"I owned this camcorder for 5 years, then mine died, but for the sake of needing an inexpensive replacement that could play my old and new Digital 8 tapes, I bought this same one again. Everything worked great during the 5 years except for occaissional humidity sensor issues. It's very sensitive to temperature changes such as going from indoors to outdoors and vice versa. There's probably better and more modern camcorders out there, and if I hadn't gotten a used one for a good price, I may have considered something else, but bottom line was I was getting ready to go on vacation when my old one died and needed to be able to use the same tapes. As far as why my first one died, not quite sure on that one. I could hear a small part loose inside for months and I think it got to a point where it landed in a spot that caused the tape release to not work, so I had to take it apart to save my tape, killing it in the process, haha."
1,NOT ANALOG COMPAPATBLE,"This camcorder was purchased as a new unit for Cristmas. It came defective, the unit would not accept the tape and continued to eject the tape. It went to the service center for repair. The software to use to look at or transfer the data onto a computer was missing. $38.00 for this CD. The unit will not play an analog tape ONLY DIGITAL, and when Sony was contacted they said the unit manufactured was discontinued. Sony support was of no help either. DO NOT BUY this unit. Jim Powell"
2,Get a mini DV Cam instead,"Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera."
4,"Good cam, but very displeased","Cant understand why they allow others to show extra add on items along with the pic of the product. I guess i am a bit out of touch but i bought this cam because i saw the accessory package picture attached with the pic of the camera, and wanted the extras with it. I got the camera with no tapes, no mini tri-pod, no long life battery, no carrying case, etc. I called Amazon and as expected i got Abdul from India to try and assist me but it is hard to understand them with a heavly accent. When i explained my problem, they sent the exact same camcorder to me, no extras. Now i am having to pay extra to get those additional items when i was lead to believe they were all included. I will be following up on this and see what they do next."
2,The good and bad,"The camera operates good, but I thought it was suppose to be new. It looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom. It does work, but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out."
3,Lacks one essential (to me) feature,"The camera is fine, but it won't play back video recorded on Sony 8mm. Unfortunately, I specifically needed it to ensure access to my pre-2002 archives. I'm including this info, just to make sure that others like me don't inconvenience the seller."
3,Useful for playing old tapes,"I bought this just to be able to play our old Hi-8 and Digital-8 tapes. Unfortunately, it won't play the older regular 8mm tapes."
4,Good for price and easy to use,Got this for my dad for Christmas. My brother then went to Europe 1 week later and took it with him. He had no trouble at all. I don't know if we find it easy because we both own the analog Hi-8 version of the camera and this was just an easy transition for us or if it is just easy to use. It does not play the old tapes from our analog recorders which we knew buying it so don't say nobody told you when you get yours and can't play back the tapes! No problems with video or audio either. Overall it is a great camera for the price.
3,NOT SURE,I was never really sure how to tell if this product was working or not. I am not using it now but maybe will give it another chance at a later date.
2,Poor Software,"Received unit and worked well for task bought it for, however, after trying to use it for more difficult tasks unit failed, tech's said to download lastest version of s/w and that made it worse. Sent unit back and received another in record time. However, have same problems, woking with techs to resolve but none seem to have expertise to reslove s/w problems. To watch TV unit works great to do much more than that is iffy."
3,Good enough.,"This is your basic video camera. I'd say it's good for those who just need a video camera for occassional video recording. It has the basic features, with NightShot as an additional bonus. The picture quality isn't as great as I thought it would be (it's a bit grainy on my 36"" WEGA), it doesn't record in stereo, and I wish it could hook up on my computer, but there's no USB port. I guess for the price you pay, it's expected. I'd recommend it if you're not really looking for something too hi-tech. I wish I could've gone with something better, maybe the next model up, but hey, it gets the job done."
4,Good Replacement SonyTRV 138,"I purchased this camcorder knowing it was not digital ""state of the Art"". I have a Sony Hi8 camcorder vintage 1993 which no longer functions reliably in the playback mode, and I saw the TRV 138 as means to play my existing tapes and transfer them to DVD's. I found the TRV 138 to be half the size of my old unit and the batteries seem to last 3 times as long. Thus it functions well and is much handier to use. It has the fold out color viewer, my old one did not, plus some additional features such as a variety of fade modes. The only negative is my old unit recorded sound in stereo, the TRV 138 does monaural. This is not really a factor in my recording needs. I have recorded music performances and found the sound to be satisfactory"
2,Good player for 8mm tapes,"I purchased this cancorder for one purpose: to playback old 8mm tapes for recording onto a DVD-R recorder. For this purpose it is ideal: low cost; colour view sceen with sound; plays 8mm and Hi8 tapes; rugged and high quality feel, so it may last a long time; apparently the only name-brand 8mm camera available at this time.If you are looking for a general purpsose camcorder do not buy this one for the following reasons1. 8mm and Hi8 is obsolete. When your camcorder finally breaks (as all three of mine did after an average of 5 years use) you will have a hard time finding a device to playback your precious tapes on.2. This camcorder has no ""steady shot"" which in my experience is the most important feature for easy recording of good quality videos.3. This camcorder is rather big and heavy compared to many others available.Steven Woodward"
4,Used Sony Camcorder,"I had been looking for a used camcorder for quite some time. While this camcorder wasn't really in the price range I had in mind initially for a used camcorder, (which ended up costing me $200 including shipping) it was everything the seller indicated it would be. The camcorder arrived when promised and as such I had no need to contact the seller."
5,Excellent Hi8 video recorder,"When our daughter ""borrowed"" our Hi8 video recorder to use on our latest granddaughter, I was left unable to watch or transfer our 40-odd tapes. No local store offered any Hi8 recorders, so I was relieved to find the same model available via Amazon. The first one I ordered was no longer available, but the second (offered for a few dollars more) showed up in excellent condition, and on time. Now if only my DVD recorder worked as well..."
1,Beware that it only records in monoral,"Opened up the box and found that it comes with only a single plug for audio and not two plugs for both right and left channels like all my other not working Hi8 Sony cameras. So can't play back existing Hi8 tapes previously recorded on other Sony HiFi Stereo cameras in stereo. Sony always drops the ball on us formerly loyal customers. They did the same thing with the Beta, where they discontinued the HiFi models first and all you could get were the left over monoural models. What would be nice would be a combo Hi8 player and dvd recorder."
1,Do not purchase this camera -will stop recording forever - black screen,"This is the second Sony we purchased. I received this last year for Mother's Day eventhough it had a tape and wasn't digital. We wanted to be able to transfer our old tapes onto dvd's but wanted to record also. To our surprise when we went on vacation and went to record we get a black screen, playback works, but you can't record. This is common with this camera, save your money and buy a different camera, this is the second sony we have had problems with. check this problem by doing a search and put in the model number, but please, if you want to use for special occasions, how would you like to get sound only? and be faced with costly repairs? Buy a different camera."
3,Buy it on EBAY,"Go to EBay and buy this item. If there is something wrong with it, take it to your local camera shop and have them repair it, and it will still cost a lot less extra than what they want at these stores. That's ridiculous what they want. Other than that, it's a good camera. If you plan on transferring your tapes on to DVD, get a camcorder with S video, this one does not have it."
1,"Wasn't stereo, sold it on ebay @ a loss :o(","Wasn't stereo, sold it on ebay @ a loss :o(. Ads said hifi sound....didn't says hifi ""MONO"" sound until read fine print :oP. Didn't use it, can't say more."
3,8mm archiving,"Steven, i would like to know how you record to DVD-R from this camcorder. I know sony offers a video adaptor, (VMC-20FR) for connecting to a TV or VCR; do you connect to a VCR, then to a DVD-R recorder?Pinnacle Systems makes a DVD Recorder that connects composite video to USB, is this what you use? I too want to preseve my old 8mm analog tapes, and i am looking for the best way to accomplish this."
5,Great for the price!,"Well, I'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A/V world.I bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up. This is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up.Just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape, and start recording away!After you climb the learning curve, of course. My one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive, and they're splattered all over the unit. Be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing, but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays.Oh yeah, almost forgot, the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit."
2,Oh Man...,Ok this is the third Sony Handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options..Sony Messed up with the USB port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the TRV 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the TRV 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality..its fuzzy.. im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the TRV280 back..I hope this has helped
2,No USB Port!,This camcorder can not be used to record direct to your computer or any of the new dvd recorders. You have to record first to video tape then be able to connect your VCR to a dvd recording device. Very disappointed. How hard can it be for Sony to add the USB port? Even my $100 digital camera has a USB port.Don't waste your money on a camera that is already outdated in technology.
3,sno jac,"waited to get to the snow b4 making review.lots of potential to get dangerous.skaters up there liked it.overall,lots of fun."
5,Great snow toy but no snow!,We're anxious to use our cool new snow scooters. They look great but we just can't test them out until the Globe cools a bit more and we get some snow.
2,"Neat idea, but hard to control",Kids used this only one time because they had a hard time controlling the steering.
2,Essentially a book of fashion photographs,"Althought elegantly designed and filled with high-quality photos, this has got to be one of the most egregious books I have run across in years. Bloch, an associate of the Duchess' lawyer, has cobbled together numerous photographs which depict the Windsors at balls, on holiday (from what?) on the Cote d'Azur, in the Bahamas, in Germany, in nightclubs, etc., etc. It is difficult to read this book and not come away with the impression that, great love story though it may have been, the lives of this woman and her husband were an utter waste of everyone's time. How bored (and boring) they must have been! Unless you want to indulge in a little elegant notalgia, don't bother with this high-fashion trash."
4,Wonderful Children's Book,"I found this to be a wonderful addition to my collection of design and patternmaking books. The illustrations are adorable, and the writing is clear.Another reviewer stated that this book would not be useful without the previous book. I have not read the previous book, and I did not have a problem understanding this one at all. It might be that if you do not have sewing or patternmaking knowledge, it would be confusing to just jump right into this book. Also, I'm assuming from the title of the previous book that it contains slopers for children. If that's all that's holding you back, you could just purchase a generic McCalls pattern, and work from that.It was nice to see some details that are ""retro,"" and there was a good explanation of how to face some garments."
1,Flat pattern alteration only.,"I have been looking for Children's drafting, to make historical costumes for my child, so I thought this book would be useful.It wasn't useful at all.This book is meant to have a supplement which includes master sloper patterns.You then use these slopers and modify them to achieve certain design elements as shown in the book.The master sloper patterns that are a supplement are not available.If you are looking for information on drafting children's patterns, this isn't the book for you.If you want to modify slopers or any other pattern (like ones you can buy in your local fabric store) you may find this book useful.Over all, there are better books out there for both issues.Of course this book is outdated as well, being a couple of decades old."
5,HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK,I EXPECT THIS BOOK TO BE GREAT ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN WAITING BY DEBRA GINSBERG.. IF YOU NEED ANOTHER GREAT INSIDE LOOK AT WAITING TABLES...CHECK OUT CLAMCHOWDER.BIZ . THIS IS A GREAT BOOK AND YES I DID READ IT.
1,Does not work,"We have had nothing but trouble with our computer and phone line since we got the catch-a-call. When it was hooked up, our connection speed was only 12 kps - 24 kps. It took FOREVER to get on line or surf the web. We unhooked it from our modem and now we get connection speeds of up to 56 kps, but now our phone's answering system doesn't work and it then rings into the computer instead of the answering maching picking up. It's frustrating and it makes me hate dialup. But not being able to afford broadband or Road Runner, we are kind of stuck."
1,Pales in comparison to other DJ Dan work,"This CD is terrible. I think it is lags far behind DJ Dan's other CDs such as ""Funk the System"" and ""Beats4Freaks"". I was disppointed in this CD. Instead, I would recommend DJ Micro ""Tech-Mix 2000""."
4,Great house CD,Not one of his best cd's but still it is some of the best funky house out at the time. DJ Dan is the premier funky house dj in the world in my opinion.
2,Poor quality coasters,"These are very good looking coasters and they work well on my coffee table, but they are very poorly made. Initially, the chrome stand came with one of the chrome posts broken off. I did not want to deal with shipping them back so I glued the post back to the base. Surprisingly, this piece which I glued back on is currently the nicest part of the coaster set. The small rubber feet which hold the coasters in place slide all around the glass, which leaves a significant amount of ugly residue all over the coasters. I definitely would look elsewhere..."
2,"Pretty, but not",I live in a humid climate and when my cups bled...they bled onto the coaster and onto the table leaving water marks. I didn't keep these long until I had to find some thirsty coasters that soaked up the excess dripping water.
3,Italian Fundamentals,"Really small writing, but packs it all in nicely. The top left corner was bent and beginning to come apart, but some tape mended it nicely."
3,A Bit Boring,"I bought this because I didn't know much about the history of Blur. This early live stuff is like watching paint dry, navel gazing, and is a bit irritating at points. It is a good one-time view, but I have no desire to watch it again. It should only be bought by the biggest fans."
5,Great DVD at a great price.,"The full concert from Blur's best era in my opinion makes this DVD worth the money especially since they play some rare stuff, the documentary is silly at times and very dated but it's cool to see the guys as they really are."
5,Great book for lovers of glass animals,This is an excellent resource for anyone who collects glass animals. The pictures are great and the information is detailed and easy to follow.
5,Excellent Source!,"This book is an excellent source of information for glass animals. The authors are very knowledgable on all kinds of glass.I have several of the books they have put out on glass of all kinds.I would recommend this book for anyone's library and in fact, have given as a gift to family & friends for their book collection to help with their glass collections."
3,Better Than Nothing,"Laura is a brilliant singer and arranger; she is simultaneously modern and recasting old-time country music. So remarkable for a New Jersey DJ! If you are new to Laura, you should start with either of her full-length CDs. Both are superb. This short set is a grouping of demos that are more primitive than her work on the other CDs. Thanks to her lovely voice and quirky song choices, this is worth owning, but it is clearly second to her better work."
4,Indeed relaxing,"We live in a very hectic world and we as humans need to take time to relax. The soothing sounds of Chamber Music is just what the doctor ordered. Coupled with a good book, or just before bed, and the hours kind of just drift away.Sample the sounds online, if this is your kind of music, or even if you are a novis, this CD may be the one that gives you your first dip into ""Long Haired"" music. I cannot think of a better place to start."
4,Wonderful book for toddlers,"This series of books has very simple story lines, with pictures for some of the words. Otto has engaged my 3 year old son... this is his favorite book right now. I am thrilled because he is doing beginning reading. The head of children's books at a large bookstore recommended it to me. I was a little skeptical because the pictures are pretty simple. She did, however, know what she was talking about. It's a good book and a good series.Julie"
4,Love Picture Readers,"I love to read Picture Reader books with my 2 1/2 yr old daughter because she thinks she can read along with me (when the pictures come up in the book) and she is very proud of herself. Most of the picture reader stories are silly stories, but entertaining for the little ones."
3,Bar music,"this cd would better serve as background while ""tapeando"" in Spain or as background music during a tapas party."
3,.,"an interesting if slightly unrewarding release from messrs Hawtin and Vath. As with many techno releases these days there is a genuine lack of entertainment value alongside some well selected tracks. The dialogue snippets grate after a while however, in fairness they do add a unique touch. There is on the other hand little excuse for ""safe"" mixing."
4,Good ! one you should be able to find at borders.......,I had just came out of the dentist and was feeling quite numb.Bought this cd and really liked it. One great thing is ALOTof people who have never heard of sven vath are going to pick up this album because places carry cd's by plastikman/Ritchie but don't usually carry any by sven. I think most people will like something on this cd. When you are feeling euphoric the repetiveness echoes in your mind. If you like it try out sound of the second season or the first cd. Ritchie's EFX CD is also highly recommended.
3,half wrong or half right????,"although richie is clearly god, i feel as though i should warn you about this album: he opens it in fine form, plays wicked tracks (with the only possible exception being 'dirty' - house anthem!! what?? although, not a bad remix). if you are not paying attention to the track numbers, you will notice at some point that the music suddenly begins to get sketchy - and then more sketchy, and then... oh, it's sven. sorry to the fans, and admittedly, i don't know anything about him outside this album, but it doesn't blend well at all! he is a talented dj, no question, but i think if you are buying the album because you love richie, reconsider it - he would understand."
4,"Still a great little book, after 35 years","I purchased this book to share with my 17 year old son. He has fallen in love with Rod's works, much like I did when I was 17. I am quite happy I had the opportunity to relocate these books to share with my family. Rod stands the test of time quite nicely."
1,Don't read this book-burn it!,"I never advocated book burning until being exposed to Rod McKuen. Widely known as a mawkish hawker of twaddle and anthologized only in chapters titled ""Recognizing Good Poetry--and Bad"", McKuen has exlpored new depths of pure piffle with this egregious insult to paper and ink. If you're a fan of camp, Ed Wood, and TV's ""Full House,"" go ahead for a good laugh. If you like poetry, save yourself and flee in terror."
4,"""Plus B-Sides?"" Aren't they all B-sides?","Music style? College-themed bar-band modern Go-go's. The topics aren't earth shattering, the lyrical focus wanders, the production values aren't top-notch--hence my title, but the energy is irresistible. Hey, they were a younger band when they cut these tracks, so if you expected them to get better before their second CD ""Because I'm awesome"" you are thinking backwards. Several things to recommend this:1. They have a bevy of differently timed riffs and beats. They don't beat you over the head with one speed.2. They do realize that musical tone has emotional value; they don't always use that knowledge to the best of their ability, but, again--you can see the learning curve.3. They're funny. There is much to be said for that rare gift. ""Jackie Chan""? Really, who can't smile through that one?"
3,Not what I hoped for,I was hoping this book series would be filled with tribal knowledge for violin makers. Unfortunately they are not. You can do better looking at forums on the web. Only basic information in the books.
3,good for limited application,"Does provide useful measurements, but was not really useful to me in the work I was doing. It has precise but narrow application and is for a person who produces violins- who already has/understands all other information regarding violin making. So, it is aptly titled, but I had hoped it would have a little more general information. I did not expect a comprehensive how-to, but would have liked a little more information on how the measurements are determined, drawn up, etc. I am more responsive to things presented visually rather than only numerically. My rating of it is based more on my expectation and experience of it than on its ultimate value as a source."
3,pick this one up,"The real winning mixes on this are the Ralphi Rosario mixes, hands down. The Junior Vasquez are...just there. The Soulman mixes have great percussion on them. They give the song a great garage vibe."
3,Best quality is size,"I am torn between 3 or 4 stars for this product.It offers a large size which is great!! But there is something in the texture of the cloth (more like chamois than micro fiber) that I find, disconcerting.When I used it on my Mac 24"" monitor, preparing for calibration, I had issues with proper adherence of calibrator (5 attempts and calibrator kept falling off). I then used one of my other micro fiber cloths on the monitor and attached the calibrator without issue. It seems to work on my flat panel LCD television but I must admit, I find myself hesitant to use in on my Canon L lenses."
4,Good reading - a taste of 3 well-known authors,"These are all good novellas, but I found that the Larry Bond story (Lash-up) dragged at times (and the giant 'rifle' should have been explained better for those unfamiliar with the concept) and the Dale Brown book was more than a bit preachy, but the combat sequences were top-notch. The third novella (Breaking Point) by David Hagberg was, in my opinion, the best of the three. I've never read Hagberg before but I will keep him on my list of authors to watch for."
3,I returned It,"The picture looks very appealing on the website but the shoe looks drastically different in real life. There is tinge of Red,Orange which I do not like about this show. Might be good for casual but I wouldnt recommend this for office wear."
4,Por fin el POP-Rock Alternativo Vive!!!!,"4 Estrellas que realmente son 5, Es logico que se escuchen parecidas las canciones y para los ignorantes eso se llama estilo, es su primer albun y estan tratando de encontrar su identidad, he escuchado y escucho el suficiente alternativo en español como para saber que sus influencias son de Enanitos Verdes, Dunca Dhu, Vilma Palma por mencionar( no comparo ojo) liricas realmente romanticas y bien trabajadas sin caer en lo aburrido. Para los calle que estan acostumbrados al ""rakata"" que se saca con un prepogramado CASIO o un MIDI, es Demasiado. Los comprendo. Escuchen el primer CD de Arjona, Enanos, Soda y hasa ellos mismos aceptan que les da pena; eso se llama EVOLUCIONLARGA VIDA AL ALTERNATIVO EN ESPAÑOL!!!!!"
3,Buy one if you're curious,"If you're curious about this vocal new wave started by ""Sin Bandera"" go ahead and buy a CD, but don't waste your time buying more, they all sound exactly the same.Sad, mexican music has some very good artists, these groups really give people the wrong impression regarding Mexican music.Ignacio"
2,"No me gusta mucho su estilo, pero...","a mi hermana le gusta éste grupo, ¿han escuchado la ""carta a PapaNoel"" que éste grupo parla? jajajaja, es lo mejor que tiene."
5,Excellente Producción y talento,"Soy un profesional de la Industria de la musica y el cine y realmente esta produccion esta muy bien hecha, se nota que se dedicaron seriamente para realizarla. Mis felicitaciones a los muchachos, sigan adelante hagan buena musica como lo han hecho hasta ahora. Al vocalista, tienes una voz privilegiada muy comercial, sigue desarrollandola y que Dios los bendiga hoy y siempre. No se averguenzen de cantarle al amor, ciertamente eso es lo que este mundo necesita para vivir mejor y sin duda alguna a nuestro creador, Dios."
5,Draw the Line is Great,"Draw the line is Ghetto Mafia's first ablum and still is one of their best. This album is one of the best I've ever heard made by Ghetto Mafia, and I rate it number one."
4,maf from GA,"tight 1st album they ever released.very rare and oop.i have 2, will sell 4 decent price as well as other rare cds and tapes.EMAIL."
1,Two Thumbs Down,First problem with this item - Is that it does not look like the picture. The candle is not white. It is pink!!Second problem - When I lit it to see the effect of the dripping it took over 15 minutes for a drip affect and it was nothing exciting. It barely dripped.I sent them all back!!
4,Orwell is also a strong critic.,"Orwell is famous for his book ""1984"". but he also is the author of several essaies, whom represent his opinion about the literature.He likes particularly the Dickens production, which he loves for the capacity to understand the popular life in England.The descriptions are strong and able to induce particular emotions, but the style remains clear and cold."
2,Poor selection of essays,"There are 14 essays in this book and 6 of them are Orwell's criticisms of various English writers, including Dickens and Kipling, and publications such as various weekly magazines for kids. As such, they are outdated and would be of little interest to most present readers. Another essay is about what Orwell thought of Gandhi, which, again, may not be relevant any more. I enjoyed only 2 of the essays, Shooting an elephant and Marrakech. The first one is Orwell's reminiscences of a particular incident from his days as a police officer in Burma, while the other one is about his experiences in North Africa. In the latter piece, Orwell offers some interesting generalizations about the insignificance of the lives of most humans."
2,Disapointed with all the religious mumbo jumbo,"This book has some nice lists, but the sheer amount of religiosity is a total turnoff. I did manage to read it from cover to cover, but by 1/4 of the way through I knew that she relies too much on miracles and invisible spirits to be useful. Unless you're a fundamentalist Christian, go find another book on the subject. There are several that do not appeal to supernatural forces, prayer or religious ritual to achieve the same objective. I give it two points because I did glean some useful information on behavior management. Other than that, the book was an exercise in magical thinking."
1,I have two different models. Both JUNK,"I bought one of the 150ft models and it seemed to work well. About a week later I bought a hundred footer for the other side of the house. About a week after that a tooth broke off one of the gears on the first one (150ft)now it makes a clunking sound when I reel it in. I noticed I seemed to have low pressure on the side of the house I installed the 2nd reel(100ft model). I just thought It was low pressure for some reason a certain times of the day. Today it was so bad It wouldn't even powder my sprinkler. So I by-passed the reel and guess what, it's the hose reel. I checked the in and out hose for kinks but found nothing wrong. These things are junk! The reason I payed over a hundred bucks for these is because I have such a bad back. I'd be better of reeling my hoses in manually then continually bending over to mess with this junk. I will be telling my everyone I can about how bad these are. I'm tired of wasting money on things that don't work."
2,love the concept,"I bought this product from an ad i saw on tv,and loved it as soon as i installed it. the problem is that it quit working after about a month of use. I think the concept is great ,but the plastic gears dont stand up to the task. I would love to see it made from metal gears instead."
5,seeing is believing,"I suggest you buy a different hose, Larry. The product works as advertised; but, you can't put a square peg in a round hole. My suggestion to others interested in an automatic hose reel is simply this: try it you'll like it! Only buy a normal sized hose that will fit.:)"
4,Very well written,I thought this book was okay! It needed more suspense! But if you love Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson a lot you should read this book! The plot was faboulous! Great Book! Read it!
3,"Mysterious, but otherwise BLECH","Okay, I admit that this book WAS mysterious and you have no idea ""whodunit"" when you're reading this book. However, it was really cutesy and weird. In a mystery story, when detectives have this ""oh, I am THE best detective and I can solve ANY case"", which Mary-Kate and Ashley had in this book, it spoils the story. I was quite disappointed when I read this book. I almost didn't read the other Mary-Kate and Ashley mysteries after reading ""The Rock Star's Secret."""
4,Appealing appetizer,Well made post-rock in the refined Tortoise vein is a delectable EP of soothingly progressive instrumentals.
2,A good start and a confused ending...,"Miguel Tamen's book presents a theory of things in combination with their different cultural impacts for example in museums and collections in 19th century Europe. The book starts very complex but ends without delivering a coherent theses. This is the main critique after my lecture of the book. The chapters do not develop one into another but Tamen's observations and interpretations remain without a holistic concept. In comparison with other studies with a more historical and genealogical perspective (for example written by D. Maleuvre or J. Siegel) Tamen's book lacks - at least for me - of a coherent theoretical insight. Nevertheless: if someone is interested in ""thing theory"" I can recommend at least the first chapters."
4,An audio sample is worth a thousand reviews...,"Length:: 2:10 MinsBelieve it or not, there are over thirty KJV audio Bibles. From the ones that I have listened to, I would give Dr. C. M. Ward four stars."
4,So far so good for a chinese made tool.,Product review:Works well with plenty of power. Only drilled 10 holes or so. Chuck seems a bit stiff but that may work itself out after a few months of use.Soapbox:I have owned many Milwaukee products in the past and recently needed something with a little more power than my 3/8 USA made drill which has lasted 10+ years of hard abuse. I decided to go with another Milwaukee assuming they would be made in the USA. Unfortunately another manufacturer has fallen to the dark side and gone to the chinese. I've never owned a chinese made tool that actually lasted more than a couple years of light use let alone the stuff I put tools through. It's sad that a great company like Milwaukee has decided to lower themselves to the level of others. If anyone knows of a USA made 1/2 drill let me know. Quality and reliability far out weigh the higher price.
4,Insights into the Great Outdoors,"I have recommended Dr Webb's book to friends, colleagues, and students interested in parks and conservation. This insider's view of the great outdoors offers a useful perspective on the inner workings of the Park Service and offers insights into the relationships between parks and the territories and people within which they are situated. Dr. Webb offers the reader just enough personal information to evaluate her commentary. This book is especially useful as an indicator of the changing role of gender in government service. So - as a record of the adventures of a women in the great outdoors - this book should be read by anyone whose life is touched by the National Parks."
1,Not as portrayed,"When I purchased this book I was hoping for a look at what it takes to be a real leader in the National Park Service. This came across as one womans ""Poor Me "". As a woman who spent some time in one of the parks she writes about, I am appalled at how she portrayed herself and describes the people she worked with. Seems more like venting, and building herself up to much more of a leader than she was. VERY Much a misrepresentation of Ms. Webbs version of the facts and her caring for her employees. Alot of un-flattering mud slinging.I would not recommend this unless you want a ""National Enquirer""look at a very good agency and the good people who serve."
3,Older Semi Hits,"This album was deceiving...it claimed to be a new album, but was just a rerelease of some older songs on one album. But if you like the Bay Area, and the sound, and want to hear some songs you might have slept on 8 years ago, it's a good buy."
5,Best bra,"This is the best fitting and most comfortable bra for me. Since it is not available at this time, I hope it will be soon. ( I might add that it is the most attractive of all the bras.)Maggie McCall"
1,The cover art is the only thing worth looking at in this entire book.,A pathetically drawn interior with a weak story. Don't waste your money.If you want great art and stories check out 'Strangers in Paradise'.Strangers In Paradise Pocket Book 1 (Strangers in Paradise (Graphic Novels))
2,Uncomfortable,Ive got back issues... I had DW throne and bought this backrest. Wasn't happy with it. I bought a roc n soc throne with backrest and compared them side by side... Much better. The DW is heading for Craigslist...
5,Lovely Perfume,"I was Happy with the transaction, Here on time and in perfect order. Takes me back many years when I loved wearing it but have been unable to find it for years, Thanks, Kay : )"
3,Wavy lines!,"This is a great idea. However, the reality is that it is very difficult to use (I applied and removed the product several times with the same results.) It seems to be nearly impossible to apply the product without getting little bubbles or wavy lines in the cured product.I finally gave up and bought new glasses. Nice idea, though. It might work ok for watch crystals or cell phone screens, but the finish is not clear enough for eye glasses."
1,Blurry,I was so excited to get my package of Liquid Lense. I have very mild wear spots on my lenses and there was no improvement and there was definate blurr after drying 12+ hours. So please don't waste your money.
1,Makes glasses even worse!,"When I applied the solution to my glasses and let them dry overnight, in the morning I found that I could not see through them at all because of the distortion caused by the solution running down the lens as it dried. Save your money for new lenses.The company I bought this product from, however, was very fast in processing and shipping my order."
3,"good, but not great","i had expected more from the book when i purchased it. although having a lot of dream topics, i found it lacking in my search for some of my own."
1,Poor quality camera,"I bought two of these cameras as gifts. Picture quality was ok...not great clarity but good color. Good for birthday party snapshots. After a few months, the sliding door stopped working on one of them. And shortly after the warranty expired (1 year) the other camera stopped working. Olympus phone service and Web site offered no help except to suggest that the only way to get it repaired was to mail it to them. For the price of $75.00 they would fix it. As the camera cost me $92.00, I'll just toss it in the trash. And NEVER buy an Olympus camera again!! That's my product review."
5,The immortal Joan Collins,"If you thought she was an evil coniving woman in 'Dynasty', you ain't seen nothing yet! Watch as Joan Collins seduces her chauffer with the fur coat, corset, and his cap! She discusses the mating rituals of rattlesnakes and the guy gets hot under the collar. The next morning she treats him like dirt and it's back to work for the poor slob.Joan plays a European jetsetter out for sex and money. The orgy at the swimming spa is worth price of admission. I'm waiting for this to come out on DVD, but until then I have my VHS copy."
5,A great read..if your interested in Indonesia's history..,"My wife is Indonesian and I plan on going soon. So with the problems Indonesia seems to have, I thought it would be wise and educate myself with the people and history. Very good for people that might want to go on extended stays and try to understand the mind set of these people."
1,dreadful and awful,"I've been a devoted Beach Boys fan for 35 years and never before have I encountered as unlistenable a recording as this. There are 4 worthwhile cuts - most notably Alex Chilton's ""I Wanna Pick You Up"" which actually improves on this beautiful childlike tune's original take with a brighter and more up tempo arrangement. Most everything else is discordant, ugly, annoying and embarassingly amateurish. I don't recommend this to any serious collector unless you want to throw away some money."
4,More Than Just Fun in the Sun,"Exquisite! For long-time Brian Wilson/Beach Boys fans, there's more to the artists' work than just ""Good Vibrations."" This loving tribute focuses on little-known Beach Boys tunes written mostly by Brian Wilson (there are also a few by his brother Dennis and other Beach Boys alum). The real treat is hearing a different side to Brian Wilson than most fans may know, where Wilson wrote about melancholy, simple pleasures like ""Wind Chimes"" and holding his baby daughter in his arms. The mostly UK twee-pop bands do a fine job covering the tunes, with mostly low-key arrangments. If you're a casual Wilson listener, skip this. If you have explored Pet Sounds and anything past 1967, then this is a treat."
3,Is this Showcase new?,"The case is awesome, very protective and attractive.But what gives with the scratch on the front plastic and the indelible smudges on the back? It looks as if it has either been used or quality control is poor. This is my 2nd Contour case and this one is definitely not as nice out of the box.If Amazon is selling seconds or floor models it should be told to the customer up front!"
3,Love everything about it but the belt clip!,"This case is gorgeous and I love the rubber bumper around the edge. The belt clip was difficult to get on and off your belt however, and it will only hold up until the first time you drop it. Now the belt clip isn't usable but the case itself protects the ipod superbly. Just pray you don't drop the thing while trying to get it on or off your belt!"
5,Feels Durable,"I'm two weeks into using this case with my iPod, and I'm pleased. Yes, the plastic scratches up fairly easily. If you're not okay with scratching, buy leather, not plastic. Otherwise, you definitely get value here. iPod fits snugly, the corners of the encased unit feel as if they could absorb minor shocks if the iPod is dropped (although I don't know this for sure, I haven't really dropped it yet). I really feel as if I got a good deal on this case. Recommended."
5,CLASSY - PERFECT FIT,LOVE IT... it fits ipod 30gb perfectly.works great in bose also. will keep your ipod safer.highly recommend this product.
2,Buyer beware,"I bought this for my husband's black iPod (I had the Claro iSkin) and then bought one for myself because it seemed less bulkier and more streamlined than my Claro iSkin. Well, it is lighter, but I agree with another customer that it attracts dust, hair, sediment (easily slips through an opening where the hinge is located as well as the touchpad). And yes, the clip is ridiculous to attach/take off). The back of my iPod has since gotten scratched up from sediment getting into the aforementioned opening, so I'm bummed. The plastic is pretty easy to scuff and scrape, too, so it just looks crappy overall. Since I scratched up the back of the iPod after using this case, I'm kicking myself for not keeping it safe in the other case with the extra protective silicon sleeve. Oh well, live and learn. Be forewarned!"
3,Sony DCR-TRV480 & TRV 460,"The sellers here at amazon are gouging the customers. Though I believe in selling what the market can bear, they are gouging and the customer should shop around. You can get 1/2 the price of the cameras on Ebay. in fact I suspect these sellers are buying from ebay and selling twice the price on Amazon. For those of us like myself wanting to transfer your hi8 videos you are better off seeking a merchandiser who sells the Sony videomans like the walkmans, they are mini vcrs that will do the same as this camera, and you will be able to transfer your hi8's to DVD and you can do so for 1/2 the price they are selling here."
4,flexible camcorder,"New recordings seem to be of very good quality. Also very pleased with ability to play & convert to digital, my old Video 8 and Hi-8 tapes. Sound quality is good but true test awaits a visit to an auto race track. No serious complaints so far. If I had a choice, prefer all manual controls over programming. Overall, an excellent machine."
4,Tasty recipes and pretty easy,I think it's a fine cookbook. The crab cakes are so flavorful; some of the best I've ever had.
3,Great pictures,He is a wonderful cook. Several of ingredients are not readily available in my area. I didn't want to hassle toorder on line.
5,Simply Ming: Easy Techniques for East-Meets-West Meals,Recipes were very quick and easy to prepare. The master sauces can go with more recipes than in the book.
4,This book enhances my love of Asian Cuisine,"What a wonderful cookbook that goes beyond what we usually see and makes Asian cooking accessible to the american home.The style, layout, and content are exquisite. An improvement over his last book Blue Ginger, which although interesting, I found many of the recipes daunting. These are easy to follow with readily aquireable ingredients. The use of rubs and sauces that can be made easily or purchased are great additions to make meals appetizing and quickly prepared.The book presentation is a wonderful read with helpful hints and comments on wine accompaniments and little nuances to the recipes.I look forward to the next one...."
1,Awful Product,"This is one really bad product. I wish I could give it a ""zero star"" rating. After less than 30 days of use the alarm and clock settings went absolutely haywire. The clock would either change the time on its own or the display would turn to hieroglyphics. Very cheaply made product, fit only for the trash heap. Avoid this product...You'll be glad you did!"
1,Broken,I received this item broken. The manufacturer's box had a clear shot. Not in the package from Amazon.Unfortunately I opened it after the final date for return.
1,What was delivered is not what is pictured!,"I bought this for a Christmas gift and even the box shows the circular shrimp top, however when I opened the box, the silver top is not a shrimp top, it's a 3 chamber triangular division. Not at all what I wanted to give as a gift and now no time to get in time for Christmas, so I'm not happy at all about this!"
1,Incredibly boring,Exceedingly boring. Enuf said. Deleted the book from my Kindle. I want my money back. Oh sorry--the book was free. I understand why it's free. It probably was in vogue in the mid-1800s when it was written but isn't now.
1,Might be good if you are as high as he was...,"I love a good comedy CD and this is not a good comedy CD. Nothing about it is clever or unique, just classic lowest common denominator humor (if you're not sure what that means, this CD is for you!) The music is awful, the unfunny bits drag on and on, and the pot-strewn humor is ironically pathetic. As a former stoner, it's not like I can't identify with that kind of humor, but my god, this is one awful production."
1,WARNING! WARNING!,"I picked this one up thinking that it was the Sasha of ""Xpander"" fame. Well, I was mistaken. What we have here is a ""power ballad"" (if you can call it that) by some cute boy. Absolutely useless and embarrassingly bad. Each mix sounds the same as the next, so what is the point of having a remix?Anyways, this song is bound to make teenage girls swoon, but it does absolutely nothing for me."
4,What the hell happened to Sasha?,"A warning to all you trance fans out there. When I first got this song, I had never heard it. But knowing who Sasha was, I figuring that if he put out a single it must be pretty good, I bought it anyways. When i listened to it, my first reaction was ""what is this tripe?"" Believe me, this is not the same Sasha of Global Underground fame, or from the famous Northern Exposure cds with John Digweed. At least, it doesn't sound like Sasha. The once hero of trance and house has apparently turned pop. Or maybe not. I'm just a little confused. Anyways, the song itself is actually one of the better romantic songs I've heard. However, I will be putting it under my ""Music for when my girl is over"" collection rather then my trance collection. Imagine playing this along with a set from Oakenfold. Go figrue..."
4,Insightful vision,An insightful little book on the construction of these beutiful homes. However it does lack complete floor plans. Otherwise a delight for those interested in architecture or this wonderful period.
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for a dictionary that listed new words, such as relate to the Internet and modern business (eg ""outsourcing""). This dictionary is not it! It is very simplistic and is probably useful as a quick guide, although if your level of French is not advanced you won't be able to use it very well, as there are no examples of usage. The blurb is misleading, as this is not a dictionary that is specifically devised for ""a global economy and fast-changing world"". Nor does it specifically relate to the 21st century."
4,a jouney home,"Some reviewers complain about the personal aspects of this book. But there is nothing wrong to blend a personal story into a travel account, is there? To me, the most compelling part of the book, is exactly the fusion, or the divergion, of the monk's and the author's journeys. There are other books devoted to historical or geographical facts, if that is what you are after. What Bernstein describes in the book, the pulls between going-home and leaving-home, pertinent to himself, is also touchingly universal. Leave home we must,like Huan Tsang and Bernstein, in order to come home to find meaning and wisdom in our seemingly mundane lives."
3,If you like Cash Money then you'll love this!!!,"This album is 5 stars for any Cash Money fan. O.K. let me explain why I only gave it 3 stars. First of all I'm not a big fan of Cash Money, B.G. is the only atrist of theirs that I like. Second of all the songs they make are kind of played out in my opinion. With that said this is the best Cash Money album ever made. If you like Cash Money this is the CD for you. I don't even really own this CD but I have heard all of the songs that are featured on it, and they are the best that Cash Money has to offer."
5,can i give this 10 stars,"CASH MONEY IS OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM IS PACKED WITH HOT SONGS AND ALL THE CASH MONEY CLASSICS. THIS IS PRODUCED BY MANNIE FRESH SO U KNO THE BEATS ARE HOT. COP THIS CD TODAY.CASH MONEY 4 LIFE!!!!!!!! HOT BOYZ,JUVENILE, LIL WAYNE, B.G., BIG TYMERS. DO UR THING"
3,You dont know,"THey are the hits. But not all of their hit. Cash money has been around since the early 90's . I cant give it 5 starts because these songs are pretty much 5 years of songs from the later years of CMR, when they been around since the early 90's. The all time greatest hits?? Absolutley not"
3,Combat #2 not As Good as #1,"This paperback contained war stories from three noted authors.The first story was by Stephen Coonts. It tells of an ex Marine sniper and a female military pilot who team up to kill theterrorists who were responsible for killing her parents. In a story authored by Dean Ing a private investigator,a bounty hunterand an FBI agent team up and discover a terrorist plot that couldlead to thousands of deaths.The final story by Barrett Tillmantells the story of a group of retired fighter pilots who battleenemy jets over the skies of California. Combat #2 was not as good a book as Combat #1. I hope that Combat #3 is an improvementover Combat #2."
5,Inexpensive and full-featured,This drive reads and writes pretty much every format you can think of and does it quickly at a great price!
1,Arrives broken every time,"I ordered these. They came in a cardboard box with NO PADDING. They shattered. I asked for replacements and asked them to pad them. Those ALSO shattered because they weren't padded. The third time I called they said they can't promised they'd be padded and gave me a refund! I still want these, but they won't send them again because they can't tell the shipping people to pad them. Ridiculous."
3,Pretty...but,"Thee are very pretty, but, unfortunately glasses tend to slide off the lick surface. It defeats the purpose of a coaster."
2,Packages arrived broken and falling apart,"While the coasters that survived the trip to my house are pretty cool looking, every package of them arrived with some problem or another.These were going to be nice stocking stuffer gifts for friends and family and so I purchased 6 packs of coasters. On each individual pack had one of the problems:1) One or more coaster arrived chipped.2) The hard plastic packaging was torn, cracked, or broken.3) The metallic corner pieces to hold the coasters in place were detached from the glass bottom.Needless to say, I had to glue and tape a bunch of things back together before I could wrap them. I would have returned them, but I didn't have much time before driving down to my sister's place, so each had to come with an apology and explanation."
3,Same problem...,"Like the above customer my coasters came broken (actually it was the coaster holder and not the coasters themselves.) On the plus side Amazon is sending me another order of the same coasters for free, so I will now have 12 coasters for the price of 6...the only thing that remains to be seen is whether the replacement order will arrive broken or not."
4,"Pretty, just not what I was looking for","This seller must have improved their shipping practices because mine arrived with no damage, it was nicely packaged with bubble wrap.The coasters are nice thick glass, and fit into the stand easily. The part that makes them seem cheap is the bottom pads, that seem like they would be prone to falling off only being held on by a sticky glue.I ended up returning this product, not because of any flaws, but because the etched design is not what I expected. The circles on the coasters are not all the same size, they get smaller and smaller from the top one shown in the picture. I wanted all uniform size circles so I sent the item back."
4,The Official Wald Review,"On recieving this product for my birthday, Excitement was satiating my body, as my sole was lifted up out of my brand new addidas shoes, with custom lettering. It is not only a great product, but it satisfies my need to digitally record any video's. The only downside it would have, is the fact that it doesnt have a memory card, so taking pictures is difficult, with the tape. Also, it doesnt have a flash like the cannon, but the Night vision is perfect for those ""late night"" recordings! :)<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:cEnn9l2qThUJ:benjamin.wald.googlepages.com/home+The+Easy+CD+Guy&hl;=en&gl;=us&ct;=clnk&cd;=37"">The Easy CD Guy</a>"
1,PLEASE PASS ON THIS,"Don't do it. Don't buy this camcorder. You WILL be sorry. There.... I've warned you. The camera itself seems to work ok, but the software that came with it is aweful, aweful, aweful. It just doesnt work."
1,Beware Of Sony,"My little advice - Beware of Sony. The quality has decreased over past years badly and customer service and technical support is very bad too. Not to mention the warranty plans and costs to fix things. I just owned a nice handycam DCR-TRV19 that died after one year of seldom use. Something that is obvious factory defect (since many people experience exactly the same problem) costs more than half of the camcorders price to fix at sony service. I advise you to have a look at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=59&threadID;=53316&messageID;=1064984 and see for yourself how Sony treats their customers.Once again, don't be blurred by pretty design. The inside is piece of crap.Sincerely."
1,What a disaster,"I bought this camcorder less than a month ago. While it was working (more on that below!) it was only average in picture quality. Its supposed to have a decent CCD but the outdoor quality was good, yet indoors it is dreadful! If you intend to use this for outdoors, like sports its OK (just OK not superior), but forget about using it indoors - bad in indoor light, awful in low light.Now for the best part......the touch screen stopped working in just a few weeks after purchase. I am careful and gentle with my electronics. Its in the shop for repair and Sony service appears to be bad also."
2,Expected More - But found a fix for a problem on the Internet,"I have not owned a video camera for a while, so in getting the Sony DCR-HC21 I thought that everything would be an improvement over what I had previously. Unfortunately the picture quality is not as good as my old VHS monster. A disappointment. The size is excellent, however. Just so you know there is a tradeoff.I was disappointed that the software which comes with the camera is woefully inadequate for transferring digital movies from the camera to your computer where you can edit them. [Don't even contemplate using the USB transfer as this will give very poor results.] This seems like such a basic thing that people would want to do with digital media, I find it amazing that the software just doesn't do it. [Easy Media Creator does not do it either.] However there is very simple freeware program which you can download at: http://windv.mourek.cz/ which makes digital transfer easy."
2,Great camera...but missing software,"The camera is very nice. It is small, clean, and easy to use. It has clear, steady images and works great in virtually any light.But like a significant number of people have already reported on the web, my camera was missing the driver/program CD. Unfortunately I didn't notice that in the first 30 days, so Sony expects me to shell out over $70 to cover their mistake.I spent over 3 1/2 hours trying to get this problem resolved to no avail. Their support site is virtually useless -- even more so when compared with other support sites on the web. The phone support wasn't much better. I was routed to invalid extensions twice and dropped into an auto-attendant loop another time. The final time they escalated my call to a hangup.You pay a lot of extra money to get the Sony name. Frankly, I expected MUCH better customer support."
2,perhaps better for very lit up rooms,"We bought the Canon ZR100 on Consumer Reports ""best buy"" list but chose to return it after reading many reviews about the loud motor/fan noise during recordings. We next went with the Sony HC21,also a recomended model. It was used in a room with two lamps and a window. The picture appeared dull with the colors and the greys were grainy. Maybe it would have been fine outside, but our house faces North and we can only do so much with lighting. This was not the camera for us even though Consumer Reports, and Best Buy workers recomended it. We returned it and exchanged it for the Panasonic pv-gs150 (about $300 more) but avoided paying the restocking fee and are very happy with the indoor picture on that one."
4,Imporant Experice 2 be shared,Video Quality : Excellent.It is User Friendly & CompactCAUTION : Drawback of Sony HC series camcordersSoftware supplied to tranfer video is pathetic. Search internet for horrible experiences faced by owner of HC series camcorders.USB cable is only to transmit images. If video is tranferred quality is very very bad.If you have SONY memory card and SONY note book it is very compatible else THINK twice before buying.
4,Great little product,This is a great little camcorder. I really enjoyed using it for the holidays! What I did find out is that the transfer software from camera to pc wasn't the easiest to figure out. I am very computer proficient and I had some small issues. I was able to transfer the movies with USB. It was real time video so slow going. All in all I think that this does exactly what they say it does and well.
4,Have not used a Camcorder for over 10 years!,"Sure is small and very easy for my wife to use. The AUTO switch makes it very quick to just pickup and shoot a whatever!I am using battery.com for power as SONY is a bit high on their prices for a battery.The product does what they say and more. It is FUN to use and works well with my computer.Remember, you will need a good size hard drive just to put the movies on if you want to edit them at all!!Yes, I would buy it again as even with my 60 year old hands I can make good videos. Get an extra battery and the external charger and a camera bag. Do not pay > $30 for the bag as the smaller ones work just fine!Have fun and good luck with yours also.....Merry Christmas from New Hampshire, John"
3,Some Corrections for Chris's Review,"A couple things about Chris's review are innacurate, so I thought I'd post a correction lest the uninformed be swayed by his experiences.The firewire (aka i.Link, aka IEEE1394) connection is the industry standard for MiniDV->computer connections. The tiny version of the connector is commonly used because there's so little space available for a connector.Also, the B&W; viewfinder is actually a *plus*, because it allows for a clearer, higher resolution image to be displayed.That's it, just wanted to clear up the impression that this camera uses a Sony proprietary connection. I'm in the market for a camera currently, and if I hadn't already found out otherwise I might have been mislead here."
5,Great Deal,I got more than I expected. A case w / strap. All the cords. Like more than buying a new camera.
2,ahh sony :(,my parents bought this when I was little and filmed everything with it. But it never would transfer anything onto ANY computer we have. The quality also is not very good but the zoom is excellent. I've never really used anything with a touch screen so I enjoyed the touch screen.
2,Not all that great...,"I bought this minidv because Consumer Reports rated it a best buy. Well, it's not that good of a camera in my opinion. The first day I got the camera home I shot basic footage indoors in what I thought was a well lit room and the video turned out very flushed and grainy. Outside it looked a little better, but it was far from what I would even call a good picture. After taking this camera back I plan on cancelling my subscription to CR as well."
1,Terrible Customer Support from Sony,"I recently bought a DCR-HC21 and lost the driver CD that came with it. I called Sony and you wanna know what they told me? Pay another 69+7 dollars and we will send you the CD.I was like, what the hell? I told them that I paid the price of this CD, the only thing that they were going to do is just send me the CD at the expense of shipping and handling or give me a web site that I could download it from. I told them, I paid the price of the program and there is no cost of copying the software once its licence price is paid, right?However after couple of days of struggle I still could not pursuade them that once a program is purchased, it means that it is purchased, the rest is just a matter of copying.So , the bottomline is I am not buying a Sony product anymore, and if you don't want to experience the same thing, you do what I am doing: Stay away from Sony.Tamer Uz"
5,Black Screen can be fixed!,"Well, about 2 months ago, I also got the ""black Screen"" an earlier commenter on this camera got. However, before buying this camera, I was told that this would happen when the camera knew it needed to be cleaned! Ya, it may seem odd, but the camera is doing the only thing it can to protect itself. By turning itself off like this, it lets you know it must be cleaned, and saves you money in the long run by not hurting the camera. Unfortunately, it seems if you don't know, you think the camera is just busted. Anywho, just a heads up for y'all so you can fix the problem before it happens to you.PS - the longest I've heard of one of these cameras going before cleaning is about 2 years."
1,Horrible Camcorder,"I used this camera a handful of times, I noticed that the lcd and viewfinder was black. I was able to hear audio but no video. I did some research and found out Sony had a lawsuit against them regarding the CCD on some of their cameras. Well they refused to fix the DCR HC21 because it was not on their list but the problem was exactly the same. I will never buy another Sony product again."
1,Great Camera -- Useless Software,"The Sony ""Picture Package"" software is horrible. I agree with the other reviews. Sony needs to get their act together. Without the software the camera is useless. (I actually have no complaints with the camera itself, just the completely worthless software shipped with it.)"
3,Nice camera just dont try to put video on your computer,"I was looking for a nice reasonably priced digital camera a few years back and this fit the bill pretty much. It has some nice features but the biggest draw back is it's not really compatible to transfer on to your computer. Which is something I wanted.The USB video quality is absolutely horrible. The Firewire compatibility might work OK, but it doesn't come with the cable. You have to buy it seperate. I haven't tried that. So the only option left is the A/V connection (which most computers do not have). To put a video from this camera onto YouTube for instance, I had to copy the video from the A/V outputs to a recordable DVD. Then transfer that over to a WMV file. Then upload that to YouTube. Not to mention any editing you want to do.Other than that, it's a nice camera. 3 outta 5"
1,Do not buy!,"I'm terribly disappointed in Sony for creating such a horrible product. It is virtually impossible to transfer what has been taped to a computer or CDR, and you must own a Sony computer to burn a DVD. So, now I have many tapes but cannot play them anywhere but on the camcorder, where they cannot be heard, because...unless you are standing within two feet of what you are filming, you cannot hear what you have taped when playing it from the camcorder, and there is no jack for earphones/headphones.Not only is the software user-unfriendly, it runs on my computer even when it is not in use. At times,the computer cannot recognize the camcorder, though it did the day before. If the software is recognized, it takes almost three times the length of the recording to transfer it, and a half-hour tape is split into four or five separate ""films.""Don't buy this camcorder unless you can afford a resentment."
5,jogger car seat adapters,There is no finer jogger than the BOB. The company is fantastic as are all their produts. The adapter is pretty easy to set up and I did actually run with this for many many miles. A godsend!
5,Works like a charm!,"I purchased the BOB car seat adapter so I could take my son running ASAP, and am so glad I did. It works perfectly..."
3,funny positioning,"We have the 2007 Bob Revolution and the 2006 Peg Perego Viaggio car seat. Our car seat does not sit at the correct angle when we use the BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter (tilts too far forward). I'm pretty sure that we installed it correctly. In order to make the car seat sit at the right angle, we have to place a small box (2 in high) on the stroller seat. Best to test out your car seat with the adapter first."
1,Box of 40% dust,"I realize that soft pastels should be soft but I do not expect out of 12 pastels to have 3 that are completely dust (no exaggeration), 2 that are so broken that they may be used as 1/4"" buts, and 3 that are crumbled down to about 2/3rds of their original size. The others are ok (not great) - not at all the quality that I expected."
4,Chi towns BEST kept secret,"I bought this a while back, this man is chi-towns most lyrical man out right now, Worst Fears Confirmed is the follow up to his debut LP, THe Darkest Cloud.....He's one hell of a battle rapper, he has creative flows, punchlines, metaphors, and just str8 up raw wordplay....But not only does he use battle rhymes on this album, he does come out with pretty solid conceptual tracks like 'When Was The Last Time' 'Farewell To The Game' and 'Acts Of Vengeance'....Man is very slept on, yet gaining attn this yr with this album....definetely do not sleep on this one right here....He isnt as lyrical as he was on Darkest Cloud, but its a solid album, 52 mins long and one of the best releases to have dropped this yr.....Buy this and the Darkest cloud today......Support some talented chi town talent like this man: Vakill"
2,Crappy Ram,"I should have bought the Kingston but I opted for this, its a waste of time but its better than having just 128MB so I give it 2 stars, it does not even work if I put in the 128 stick that I have together with it."
3,Not sure,Right now the memory isn't working! I am trying to get someone to check my computer to make sure it is my computer!
1,Not Happy With Product,The product was the wrong size and I have been trying to find out where I can return it and get the correct product but have had no luck - Can you tell me where I can return it and get my money back???? I am not happy at all.
1,"Failed Memtest86 from Emartbuy, defective product, terrible customer service","I order this for my GA-7ZM motherboard, I've been buying RAM for this PCfor several years. I've been using PCs for over 20 years.I ordered it through Emartbuy.The RAM was shipped in a soft plastic bag, no hard plastic enclosure.I ran it through Memtest86 and lots of errors showed up right out of bag,more errors than the stick I am trying to replace that was in use for 7 years. And it failed the Memtest twice, that's a first for me.I contacted eMartbuy, sent the memory back. Their replies shocked me, theyclaimed they tested it before they shipped and they tested again after they got the return, and the memory still works.I can't say about other vendors that's selling this product.DON'T buy from USA eMartBuy, these are not honest people."
1,Not Compatible,I own a G4 PowerPC and was hoping to just jack in some cheap generic RAM. I was unaware that Macs require a specific chip and the only way you will know if it functions with your computer is if you get certified Ram. This Ram actually stopped my Mac from even starting up. Incredible.
5,I needed it . . .,". . . and I got it fast at a low price. I had shopped locally, but it was out of inventory around here. So I went to Amazon."
1,did not work in Dell Dimension 4300,"I bought 4 sticks of 512 MB for 2 of my dell Dimension 4300. None of the 4 sticks worked. I got all kinds of errors. When I went back to old 256 sticks from Dell there was no issue. Since I only paid 10 bucks or so for each stick, it's not worth my time to return them. Live and learn..."
1,Bad memory Bad customer service,"I purchased this memory and it didn't work in my computer after installing it my monitor would not come on. I made serveral attempts to customer service and sometimes didn't hear anything until I sent another email. I finally was told to give them my computer model number and make and I did, then didn't hear anything again and finally I was told to send the memory back. Now that company is charging me all kinds of fees for returning it. After it's all said and done I paid a total of $40. and now with all these fees what the hell are they going to give back to me? Fees like e-bay listing and some other non-sense I order this from amazon not e-bay. Before you purchase this memory get as much info as you can and research"
4,SDRAM For my computer,I needed more ram to get Mint Linux to work and these chips did the trick. I also recommend Mint Linux it works great and is free.
1,Came on time but it did not work with my computer,The memory came in fast but it did not work with my desktop that takes this kind of memory. Dissappointed..........
3,Know what you're getting.,"The RAM works but know what you're getting. I purchase this to re-purpose an old computer (Gateway P-III) for basic network file-sharing but when installed, it only registered 128 MB. After some time messing around with the BIOS, it just wouldn't register 512 MB. I believe some other reviewer stated something earlier regarding this discrepancy so please refer to their review. However, I was able to use it on a different system that recognized it as 512 MB (not my initial intention), so I kept it."
3,"No good quality, Blocks my computer","I had to ask for a replacement because it kept blocking my computer everytime I used it. After it was replaced, it did the same thing once and it has not done it again since then (last week), I dont really use that computer very much, so maybe I'll just leave it like that."
2,"one worked, other one didn't","I bought 2 of these ram sticks for compatible old motherboards. One of them worked perfectly and I am currently using it without a glitch. The other one did not respond from the start, looks like it was delivered faulty (Testing it on a fourth cpu to see if it responds... although not likely). I would suggest if you are buying more than one stick, evaluate the possibility of investing that money in building a new motherboard system."
3,"Good tools, needs more precision",This kit has all the tools you need for those corners. The items could use a little more precision to guide you in making great corners.
4,Good value for the money,"Good product for repairing or making picture frames. This is not professional quality, but a great value for the DIYer. The miter box and saw could be omitted from this set, better off using your own, but the clamp and fasteners are worth the price of the set. Would purchase again."
3,Being a professional Framer,We have not had a chance to use the product yet but being a professional framer that has sold the professional equipment. We have been looking for a fairly inexpensive way to get some of the equipment to use just for ourselves. Professional equipment is very expensive. This looks like it should work fairly well. Check back after the summer and we should know more.
2,"okay for the money, but the pictures oversell it","I ordered this ring based on the photos, thinking that the stone would be a rich royal blue. When I received it, the stone was very dark, almost black. The photo also makes the gold look thick and substantial. The metal is so thin that I thought I was going to bend it by just trying it on. It's a very delicate ring, and not at all what I was expecting. I was surprised because I had ordered a ring from the amazon collection about a month ago, and was very pleased with the quality, so I came to trust that most anything from that particular collection would please me. I sent it back the same day I received it. I can see it being a value for its price, and you probably can't find much better in that range - I think I'm reacting more to the disparity between the pictures and the actual product."
4,"Great Cooler, But Drainage?????","We purchased the Coleman Xtreme 50 Qt. and it really DOES keep the ice for 5-6 days. Great addition to the boat! In general, we love it. But, why did Coleman put the petcock for the drain on the same end of the cooler as the long tow handle? If they had just put the drain at the opposite end, one could leave it open and allow it to drain naturally while being towed across parking lots, docks or picnic areas. As it is now, if you want to drain off surplus while it is standing still, you have to lift it by a short handle and bend over while it drains. When loaded, this guy IS heavy...kind of tough on us 'boomers'. Just a thought...Carol Johnson - Morganton, GA"
2,Does not stack up to others,"I recently purchased this Coleman Xtreme 50 qt on wheels. it has been just fine for keeping the beer cold for several hours, however, the real test came when I went to the beach last week. We had 3 coolers of which one was my Coleman Xtreme. The Coleman went head to head with a 5-day Igloo and a 5-day Rubbermaid and by an enormous margin, the Coleman lost. both 5-day coolers had plenty of ice cubes remaining to keep drinks cold even after 3 full days, whereas the Coleman was down to almost water after 24 hours. I was very disappointed. I'll likely move to an Igloo or Rubbermaid in the future."
3,works,"it is worth the price paid for it. Nothing extra special to get a higher rating, nothing wrong to get a lower rating."
2,THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS!!!,"This CD is cleary being advertised as a Greatest Hits CD with ""Original Recordings Remastered"". That is not true! The term ""Original Recordings"" means the actual recordings that were played on the radio back in the day, and heard on the original singles and albums. This CD DOES NOT contain those original recordings that were heard on the radio. These are NEWLY-RECORDED versions, with new vocals, and new music tracks. (Some people may choose to call them RE-MIXES, but either way, they are new versions and not the originals). Although the new recordings do sound very good, this CD is seriously deceiving to customers. Even on the CD itself, it does not state anywhere that these are re-recorded versions. Therefore, I must give the CD a low rating, because it is not being accurately described."
1,Waste of Time,I was very disappointed with this item. No matter how hard I tried I could not get the adhesive strip to stay in place. Each time I lowered a window the chrome visor went down with it.
4,"Very nice, but fronts didn't seem to fit well","The look great with my chrome bug shield on the front bumper. The ones for the rear windows fit perfectly. However, the fronts felt like they had to be forced. I truly hope they don't fall off sometime down the road as I read in some other reviews."
2,a denali owner,"2 visors had mild scatches on surface forcing me to dislike. and even if they were scatch-free still would've returnedcause they didn't do anything for the denali windows, the roof chrome strip was enough so ordered smoked from the dealernot yet installed but looks better against black and tinted windows"
2,worst production ever,"great bandshorrible productionbig let down from POW too, i mean they only got 4 tracks on here and 2 of them are bad cover songs."
1,85 bucks?,"Enjoyed reading McEnroe's autobio, so did a search & found this. Can someone explain why this book costs so much??????? Sorry Pat, your life can't be that interesting. (had to rate it something - thus the 1 star)"
3,They waited too long to bring the priginal cast back!,"This one wasn't bad for being 4th in the franchise. However, this one should have at least been 2nd or 3rd. It was good to see many of the originals again."
4,Fast & Furious,"This was a good flick, the best one since the first film. They had Vins deductive skills supped up more than the cars."
3,Fast&Furious,Fast and Furious was a good movie the DVD work well on my DVD player and PS2. The cool part of the movie two of the hottest Hip Hop Reggaeton artists Don Omar Y Tego Calderon .
3,Gift for a friend...,The service I got when ordering this movie was great. It was affordable and I got it quick. The movie itself however was not for me. I bought it for my boyfriend who is a Fast & Furious fan and needed the newest to complete his set. Therefore I cannot really rate this movie.
2,rehashing mediocrity,"I'm not much of a fan of the original, and not at all of the spinoffs or ripoffs. Fast and Furious was as entertaining as the original without the originality. I only watched it because it was broadcast. In the age of mma, Vin Diesel's tough guy machismo is comical rather than intimidating, and Walker's beta male as leading man style is an awkward phenomenon. An action movie will only ever be as good as it's protagonist is inspiring.There were a few scenes that were fun to watch, like the tunnel scene at the end, but the fun never lasted long. The only standout was the actor who played Braga, the main antagonist. This movie is summed up by the scene where Diesel and Walker say to each other, ""You thinkin what I'm thinkin"", referencing a plot revelation the audience saw well in advance. That is to say, ""Fast and Furious"" is essentially a collection of well-used action movie techniques stitched together unimpressively."
3,The Boys Are Back!!!,"It has been a long time since I've watched the original, but I knew what was going on and who everyone was. 5 years after the original, Dom and Brian are back together racing, and getting revenge! They are both looking for a man named Braga, a drug lord who recruits street racers to move heroin across the US-Mexican border. If you like the Fast and Furious series, action, and suspense, you'll love FAST & FURIOUS!!!"
1,Because the world needs more ricers,"Terrible movies with a horrifically moronic econobox, fart cannon and park bench wing equipped fan-boy following. These movies are just plain worthless and completely insulting to those with any hint of intelligence."
2,a bluray collector.,my two stars in not toward the movie at all. i love this movie. but my two stars is toward the fact that im a bluray collector and wished my copy of the movie came with the protective collector jacket. and i wish amazon would let you know before hand if it had it or not.
3,great seller and fast shipping,this movie is a perfect comedy if ur a fan of comedy. get a copy of this movie
1,Holy Crap Batman...,"I was thinking new cars+original cast= YAY! I was wrong. This movie barely focuses on cars, it's more about a revenge plot the whole movie. Cars are kind of just a side thing. I say, if you really want to see it, go rent it for $1 at a red box. Not worth it. Tokyo drift was better than this one."
3,"Better than 2, not bette than 1 or 3","Back when the first Fast and Furious came out, the souped up street racing scene was something, though not new, was not well know. Now, after a wealth of street racing movies and the decline in the careers of Paul Walker and Vin Diseal, this movie can't capture the energy of the first one. As a revenge movie, this film definitely has a darker tone, but nothing is really new. At least Fast and the Furious 3 took the series in an entirely new direction, so long as you could believe someone in highschool had a massively receeding hairline."
3,Fast & Furious (Two-disc Special Edition,Great movie. Just very disapointed we did not get the 2nd DVD! It does set up nicely for the next movie in the series/
5,Finishing collection,"I of course have already seen this movie thousands of times. However, I wanted all of the DVDs as a collection so I bought this together instead of having them as a separate intity."
5,Fast & Furious,It's a great video bringing back the main cast and loaded with action. One of the best in the series of movies.
4,america's critic,"cgi through mountain guys come on it looked like doo doo, the story put the collection together great acting was great it just couldn't catch up to the fast and the furious pt1, great cool stuff on blu ray though reccomand to purchase this one."
3,I love cars,"If you love cars and car movies, you'll love this movie. Do not watch this movie for plot or the great acting, it is not a classic :) but for pure entertainment, lot's of action, and great fast cars: then you found the right movie.This is the second best movie in the Fast & Furious series with the first one being the best of the series."
5,Fast and Furious (2009),"Best of all the Fast & Furious movies, and way better than the third, this one goes back to the original story in a well-written, well-acted way. actionpacked way. It has all the originals in it, and is the best directed movie I've ever seen. I gave it five stars because it's badass, and I'm gonna watch it over and over again until my retinas explode.Five StarsAwesome Movie"
5,Awesome Movie,"I saw this in theatres earlier this year, and being an avid F&F fan I would have to say that this is the best- or at least 2nd best Fast and Furious to date ( You can't really beat the orginal). It definately isn't car-porn like the previous two movies, but becasue of its solid storyline I would definately recommend watching this one."
4,Worth the wait,"I really liked the first Fast & Furious, so much that I bought the sequel hoping for more of the same. I was really disappointed in the 2nd movie but once again gave the third installment a try in hopes that it would be more of the first. Once again I was disappointed. So when I heard the new version was the same actors as the first one, i knew I had to give the franchise one more try. I was not disappointed, this is a decent movie with plenty of action, cars, and girls....basically the kind of movie that appeals to all guys and the acting and plot make it worth the time for the ladies. If you like movies with lots of action than you will be happy with the Fast & Furious, its not going to win any awards but it is worth your time."
3,Not the best of the series,"The Fast and The Furious was better, but this was the best of the sequels."
2,Big disapointment,"A big disapointment. With the return of the original cast I expected it to be on the same level as the first installment -- which it isn't. The screenplay has several holes, the excess of CGI images made the movie to look like a video game and very unrealistic (especially the tunnel scenes), and the plot is simply ridiculous. It is worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious, which is not that great. Only the first scene is interesting, all the rest is a waste of time."
1,Gives `mindless' a new name...,"Seriously, I'm a fan of the franchise. I loved the original, despite its ridiculousness. I actually enjoyed the second one, to a far lesser degree, and I really liked the way the rebooted the franchise with `Tokyo Drift'. I was actually excited to see the original cast come together for this fourth installment. Sadly, it's a disaster. I mean, this is barely entertaining. The premise is far too similar in scope to feel anything remotely enjoyable, and while this sites reviewer wants to tout these thrills as being anything but cheap, I must digress and state that these chills are the epitome of cheap. They don't illicit anything genuine. There is a limit to stupidity in a film. Certain films are crafted to serve the masses a dose of `good time', and I can embrace that on occasion and when done right, but this is far from right. This is just plain bad. The acting, the script, the generic feel; everything is atrociously generated."
5,great movie,"wow fast & furious won't never get old i can watch this like a million times, its like seein it for the first time."
3,It was Okay!,A little better than Tokyo Drift but not as good as the first two. I didn't feel like there was as much to do with the cars in this one and it seemed like an awful amount of shooting and violence. Not that I am opposed to movies with some violence and shooting but I just didn't expect so much in this series of movies. It's worth watching if you liked the other Fast and Furious movies!
4,FAST AND CURIOUS,"Another home run for Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. This movie starts out fast and crossing the finish line just in time to save the day. I really enjoyed this the 4th of 5 installments in the Fast & The Furious franchise. I am truely curious if they can keep up the pace in the next; ""Fast Five."" I can't wait to watch and find out.Fast & Furious (2009)"
2,"cool movie, mad about how it was shipped","this is one of the best f.f. movies they made, very good story line and part five is even better, i bought this bluray from amazon bc from the pics it shows it comes in the cardboard packageing bc my other movies i try to buy with that covering, well once i open the box sadly to say this bluray didnt come with it so kinda tickd off bc it doesnt match my other blurays, owell i guess, atleast i got a good deal for it,"
5,"Powerful Music that Doesn't Let Up, Recommended!!!!","This CD really blew me away, after being bombarded by so many other so called ""rocker"" women, I was hesistant when I bought the album but she blows all the others out of the water. From the first track Goddamnit which is a pumping anthem about organized religion through to Don't Be You and Girl Next Door, my favorite track on the album, to the beautiful closer, A Happy Song. The whole album rocks and there is not one weak track on the entire album. The production is great and I can't wait to see her on tour. For those who love Evanescence and even Avril, RPM is a sure fire hit. She has a lot of edge and her lyrics spare no one including organized religion and the government. This is a woman who mean business. Highly Recommended !!!!!!!"
4,Early Moore leaves me wanting more.,"This collection of Jackie's earlier efforts is thorough, leaving me to search for a collection encompassing herlater work."
3,Soul,"This is mostly her earlier work. If anyone could point me to her later work ie.1973-1979. I'm talking about ""With Your Love"" and ""Sweet Charlie Baby"" then I'd have a lot more to say. These album are almost non-existent."
2,"Not great, but noteworthy...","'Precious, Precious' was/is a great song. Unfortunately, Jackie's song writers were too prone to dip into the passive 'my man done done me wrong' bag. 'Willpower' is a blatant ripoff of Joe Simon's 'The Choking Kind', while the other tunes on this disc basically flounder because of poor production and performance.What makes this disc more interesting to me is that at times some of Ms. Moore's vocal stylings and delivery sound eeriely similiar to Whitney Houston's singing in the 90s. Don't believe me? Buy this disc and compare Moore's vocals to say, The Bodyguard soundtrack. At that time Whitney was being courted by Bobby Brown, right? I wouldn't doubt that Whitney was singing along to 'Precious Precious' between sips of Hennessy back then.Download the single 'Precious Precious' because its a great Soul record and Jackie Moore's greatest recording. But I'd buy the CD only for Soul/R&B; historical reference."
2,Other Songs,"It was really her earlier stuff...I'm trying to find a particular song titled ""How's Your Love Life Baby"". If anyone knows where I can get it or what cd its on let me know...."
1,A Book for Insomniacs,"This book, though filled with a treasure of information, ranks along beside college text books for interest. This would be good for one researching facts about this fascinating person, but not for those of us who wish to know the man himself."
4,"Very informative, but....","I sensed that the author had something against Maria Cole, Nat's widow. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but that's the feeling I got. I'm sure she felt she was doing the best thing to help her husband, but others suffered for it. I was thinking that she could have been the female version of Berry Gordy, Jr! She was painted as a overbearing shrew. Overall, though, the book is good. There are some small errors in it, however. You will want to read more about Nat's life, and after finishing this book, that's just what I did. For a more current view and more thorough explaination of the events that happened to Nat, I recommend the Leslie Gourse and (especially) the Daniel Epstein biographies on Cole. These three books together will give you great insight into the man, his music, and his life. Now if we could only get a movie made!!"
3,Nice for a the price.,"I received my Invicta watch last week. It's a little bulkier than I thought it would be. The timepiece is a little heavy and tends to slide to the wrong side of my wrist. It's made for a larger person. The leather straps are rather stiff and don't wrap around your wrist very well, but that may improve with wear. The watch face is attractive, I like the mother of pearl face. The crystal is is very thick, it seems very heavy duty and durable. Fot the price I think it's a nice casual watch. If you have a small wrist, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,I'm little and this watch is big.,"I bought this watch after reading the review bellow.But I just loved it's shape, the mother of pearl dial, the vintage look... And although I'm little with a very small wrist I decided to get it.Of course the stainless steel expandable wrist band was way too big on my wrist. But this watch is better looking with the leather straps on it. The straps are stiff when new but they conform to your wrist in 2 to 3 days of usage. It's a heavy watch, nicely built and I like the fact that it's a 100m waterproof.The scratch-proof sapphire crystal that caps the dial has the lupah feature in it which makes it easier to see the time.In fact this watch looks prettier than what the picture shows."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a great buy, unfortunately I will be returning it soon. The watch is rather big, not something that I usually mind, but it is too thick. The chain band is too big for my wrist, it's elastic and looks kinda cheap. The other leather bands are poorly made (I think) the leather is tough and the band itself is rather thick and poofy. They have a patent leather like shine and quality to them. The colors are also less than stellar, the black actually looks grey. Overall, I didn't like the look of this watch at all. In my opinion, it looks cheap."
4,good quality and style,"Very nice watch. Face is rather large, but wears very well. Nice quality of bands"
2,Not very durable...,"Watch face larger than expected, but did enjoy wearing it. The first time I dropped it, the face shattered and watch stopped working. Very disappointed in how easily it broke. Better off with a Timex."
5,Country music fan from Colorado,"This song not only has heartfelt lyrics but a chorus line that when in concert involves everyone. I saw Chad Brock in concert and he was FANtastic. This song is a perfect example of how fate can change a person's life, if you believe."
5,"Excellent ""Scenes""!","What a great book! Having spent my summers in Susquehanna County, PA, I can relate to many of the places shown in the book. It is full of facinating photos from many years ago and also full of facts about how the railroad changed the way the area looked. I loved the old train photos! I used the book to try and find some of the locations shown within it and with the help of the photos I found many of the places listed in the book, pretty neat! If you are interested in old trains and especially if you are from the Susquehanna County area of PA, this book is for you!! Tim"
3,"""I Represent"" Has Some ""Broken Promises""","This CD is one that either you like or you don't. If you like the song ""Broken Promises"", get the single. If you like ultra fluff pop ballads and trying-to-be-hip white girls, than this CD has your name written ALL OVER IT!! The CD starts off good enough, with the title track and ""BP"" moving along nicely, then it gets stuck in a dreary ballad called ""Stay"". The whole mess goes sour from there. Don't get me wrong, she CAN sing, but she needs better material than this. She could be a good adult contemp artist (like Celine Dion), but she's being passed off as an older Britney, and is just doesn't work. She even looks kind of pissed-off on the cover. There are some spots on the album that are o.k. (""I Cry Real Tears"" is a good one) and there are some that reek (""Wasted Breath"" is a slowed-down version of ""Broken Promises""...I kid you not). Overall, she needs to find songs that fit a Celine, not a Britney, and she will go far."
1,TOO BAD YOU CAN'T GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR,"Anyone who is thinking about purchasing this will be better off...STICKING TO BRITNEY.At least Brit has some talent.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!This is the worst pop album I have ever heard in my entire life.I challenge anyone to find one that is worse.You would think Justin's mom could recognize talent...Tonya,Sweetie don't quit school.I am embarassed to admit that I once owned this album-until I ran it over with my car.However,I do recommend MIKAILA."
4,Yet Another Teen Princess,"There is absolutely no difference between Tonya Mitchell and Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, and all the other teen pop princesses. But if you like all of these artists then you will like Tonya. She has a strong voice with great dance pop and sweet ballads. The production is very well done and not overdone which let her vocals shine. The first single is broken Promises, a killer pop song that should have gotten her some recognition. Unfortunately the song went no where. Other greta songs include the title track I Represent and You're the One That I Want. All great uptempo tracks. She sounds the best on the ballads. Stay, I Cry Real Tears, and Wasted Breathe are lovely. Tonya is very talented and it is too bad that she's just gonna get caught in the mix of all the newcomers in the pop world, considering she is one of the best of the bunch."
5,Terrific movie,"This movie is a wonderful, wonderful film. They really don't make movies like this any more. The music, the writing, the acting.... what a beautiful experience. It's one of those movies that I'll want to watch again, and again."
2,Disappointing,Sad. I didn't care for the actors or their singing. It was like if your local church or high school put on a presentation of RHPS. Patricia Quinn (Magenta) singing Science Fiction was absolutely horribly out of tune and step. The show doesn't improve from there. Had I know Netflix had it I would have rented it. Not worth the $$ !! Suprised Richard O BRien was connected with this. It was a benefits for some charity but it was ungodly bad!
4,A delightful listen!,"I purchased this book on audiocassette and, as someone who enjoys both murder mysteries and cats, enjoyed it thoroughly. The author certainly is a cat person, and she spices the whodunit with humorous cat incidents. Each ""kitty break"" brought a smile to my face. It's also nice to enjoy a family-friendly story for a change."
4,An old charmer,"One of the earlier books in the series, this one has more wit and greater character development than the newer ones do. Qwill is still a working reporter for the Daily Fluxion, and he, Koko and Yum Yum end up taking a room in a boarding house over an antique store in Junk Town. There he finds murder, romance, and even a Christmas bonus amid an array of unique neighbors. There are three suspicious deaths in this book, but it's hardly violent or even especially suspenseful. Instead, it feels like a gentle holiday adventure, with just enough intrigue to hold your interest, and tons of local color."
4,Does not come with Gasket INTENTIONALLY,"I was initially concerned when I received this item to find no supplied gasket. According to Mr. Gasket's web site there has been a design change and a gasket is no longer required with this part.[...]""Note: The mounting gasket has been eliminated from this oil filter adapter kit. Adapter will seal without mounting gasket, it has an embossment incorporated into top of adapter. Adapter will seal to engine block on the embossment."""
5,I love it,"este producto me encanta pues siempre lo tengo en mi vehiculo, aqui en PR dejaron de traerlo y decidi comprarlo a ustedes gracias"
1,Doesn't work.,There was a fire in my kitchen and the alarm was 10 feet away and it DIDN'T SEND OFF A warning. The alarm was only two months old with new batteries.People depend on this to save their life...I hope they get sued for such a unsafe product.
1,"Alarm triggers with steam, but not smoke?","Absolutely useless. Whenever someone is taking a shower, the steam from the bathroom sets off the alarm in the hall 15 feet away. Heaven forbid I boil water on the stove 15 feet from the downstairs alarm--the steam strikes again! I've begun taking the battery out while cooking or showering, which is a pain in the neck. And based on the other reviews, when there really *is* smoke nearby, nothing happens."
1,Should be illegal / recalled / discontinued,"We have a woodstove and wanted to be alerted if during an overnight burn there was back draft, producing smoke. Plus just wanted the reassurance of having the smoke alarm. This unit consistently remained silent when another smoke detector nearby sounded due to smoke. So I agree with the other posters, this detector is not only junk, it could end up killing someone due to its shortcomings. I will never buy another First Alert product if I can help it. Shame on them for not recalling this thing."
1,Drubbing,"As someone who immersed myself, erroneously and unnecessarily,in the world of arms-length, mystic mumbo-jumbo, it is not withoutsome validity that I say that this book was entirely ""retrograde"" when it comes to adding to quality of life. Not only did it make it impossible for me to have normal relationships with other human beings it helped compound any defects that I have found in spiritual systems full stop. It was the line about all tests of love leading to unconsciousness and the following assault of the mystic - ha - voices. Don't ask me ever again to help the gaolers to build the cage so I can lock my heart and mind away from reality in this fairy floss world of shadows and make believe."
2,Succubus - Sucks You Bet!,"As a fan of most Redemption Films, although most are hit or miss but cater to a genre I enjoy, I try to check out as many of their releases as I can. I was excited when I read the Amazon product details for this one, bagged and tagged it as soon as it came out, and was shocked when I watched it. Unfortunately, it was probably the weakest release of theirs I`ve seen yet. All of the product details are fabrications (if not outright lies), as there is no real horror to speak of, no real mystery involved, no dark forces at large, nothing remotely interesting anywhere. To make matters worse, a Succubus is an irresistably beautiful demon who drains her human lover of lifeforce while engaged in carnal copulations, according to mythology anyway, and the Succubus here is a fat, ugly broad you wouldn`t take home after last call in a bulldyke bar... skip this one and slit your wrists instead. Yup, it`s that bad."
2,"Good atmospherics, but light on plot","This movie is generally true to Scandanavian horror. It maintains a generally creepy feeling throughout through effective use of music, camera angles, filters, and the like. If you're into Scanadanavian horror (e.g., Let the Right One In), you're likely to find aspects of this appealing. However, irrespective of that element, the story is thin and very slow to develop, bordering on boring. Also, despite the awful box art, this film is low budget but it has a much more professionally polished feel than the box art would otherwise indicate. Worth a rental for the die hard Scandanavian fans, but should be a lower priority viewing."
2,Traditional Yang-style Tiajiquan,I think that this DVD would be better if it had english translation. Rather than sub-titles. It is dificult to try this tia chi while trying ti read sub-titles.
1,DIDN'T LIKE IT!,I bought this after a lengthy discussion with the manufacturer. I wanted something very small to use at Starbucks. It looks small in the picture--but it isn't. It's big and bulky. Regret purchase.
4,Not a bad choice for an undergrad text,This was the book used when I took heat transfer. I found it to be a good supplement to the lectures and do still refer to it. I wish Mills spent more time on using numerical analysis.Like Any text book it has to be opened and read to be useful
2,"a binding rip-off, literally","I've enjoyed working with the text and I think it's structure is generally fairly good. I have a few problems with the organization of the convection chapters (4 & 5). Working with those chapters requires a lot of flipping back and forth. That complaint aside, the material itself is very good.The problem with this book is that the binding is of terrible quality. I think the book was printed in 1999 (maybe it was 1998, I'm not sure). At any rate, the pages fall out all the time with only light to moderate use (and this is true for everyone in my heat transfer course who got the book). Keep the book opened to a page long enough and it will separate from the binding and fall out. This is a total rip-off for a text that costs >$100 paperback. If a prof assigned the book, I would try to convince him to assign a different book."
5,My Favorite Things - One of my favorites,"An excellent introduction to the work of Mr Coltrane, one of his signature tunes. Along with Giant Steps, this is essential for any understanding and appreciation of jazz."
5,Easy listening and quality of jazz is truly jazz of the 60',I have not been moved by this type of smooth instrumental since the Vietnam war began in 1964. A truely mellow blowing of the clax.
3,A Bit Stale,"Coltrane breaking out his soprano sax and riffing (in an Eastern fashion) all over the title track is, when it's all said and done, great stuff. But I prefer to hear subsequent live versions of the track, which have more bounce to them. The rest of these tracks aren't my favorites from these sessions, the first that Coltrane cut with Tyner and Jones; I prefer the other, bluesier tracks they did on those days. These tracks just don't move me."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is the first jazz album I ever heard and it's still one of the best. I was so bored with rock at the time that I perused my dad's CD collection and found this beauty. Somewhere along the way I remembered hearing the Coltrane was famous and really good. So I gave this a try. This is an EXCELLENT disc to start off a jazz collection. It is easily one of the most accessible recordings in the entire jazz canon. I started here and branched out into many different areas of jazz.The bass and piano vamps on this disc are hypnotic-especially in the title track and the periodic breakdowns in ""Summertime"". Rhino has done a nice job reissuing this for Atlantic records. Absolutely essential."
4,A sacreligious dissent,"Sometimes an old record doesn't sound as good as you remembered. The truth is, this classic original version pales in comparison with the many live versions Coltrane was to produce in the next few years. Here, he still doesn't know his way around the soprano yet, and he struggles, sometimes painfully, to control the horn. Although his, much lauded, radical reconception of the song is still there, it's really not a bad song. It's hardly comparable to Sonny Rollins' versions of ""I'm an Old Cowhand"" or ""There's No Business Like Show Business,"" truly execrable ditties transformed into stellar jazz. For the rest of the album, JC is back on the tenor, so this is an obvious must-buy, but if you want to hear him really tear up MFT, get any of the Impulse versions and hear the difference."
3,Size runs very small!,This claims it is a 3-4T but my daughter is your average 3 year old and the skirt does not even cover her behind. It is an adorable out fit and I would gladly give it 5 stars had the sizing been accurate.
4,Great for the Price,"I don't usually write reviews for products, but after reading the reveiws I decided I needed to comment. I bought the 3T/4T size costume for my 2 year old daughter. I went back and forth debating the size I should get based off of the reviews. My daughter is 35 inches tall and weighs somewhere around 32 pounds. I'm so glad that I got the 3T/4T as I believe the 2T would have been to small. The boot tops fit great, the hat fits her head, and the belt is only a little bit to big. I'm really only putting this review on here to help others with sizing. Overall it is a costume that is going to be used once and then probably sent to goodwill or handed down so for the price it was fine."
2,"Too small, not a 3-4T.","The look of the costume as pictured seems cute, especially on the little girl who appears 3-4 years old, but the costume wasn't made to fit a 3-4T. It looked like it could maybe fit a 1-2 year old, maybe. Rather small, but still cute. Had too send back."
4,Cute,The skirt seems a little short & the shirt a little big. The hem on the neck was unraveling & part of the seam on the skirt was not sewn. However those were easy fixes. Had I had more time I would have exchanged it. I did add some beads to the hat & belt. It was too hot for the boot covers. Even with the few imperfections I really like the costume & hope she can still wear it at Halloween.
5,cute costume,"very very cute and great for the price, my daughter loved it. the costume does look a little diffrent in the photo it looks perfect, when i recived the item i was a little dissapointed about how cheap it looked in person but in the end my daughter loved it had fun in it so im happy"
4,Fun to Play,I have fun playing this game with my family. There is a little bit of strategy and a lot of luck to win.
4,talking caller id,"This is the second talking caller id I have used. One drawback is it only announces the caller once. My previous unit (different model/manufacturer) announced twice, however, this one has several features the previous did not have, like setting up a specific message for selected callers. On the whole, I have given 2 as gifts and have suggested to friends who have also purchased for their own use and as gifts. They have been received wonderfully. It is a pleasure to be able to screen your calls from another room!"
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"It is so nice to hear who is calling you so that you don't kill yourself running for the phone if the call is from a telemarketer or someone else you don't want to talk to. The set up is very easy (it only took me 5 minutes).This caller id has a really nifty feature, you can record a message and specify which number(s) to play it for and only people calling from those numbers will hear the message."
4,Talking caller ID,"This is a great product, but a little confusing to run. It is wonderful for visually handicappped persons, it remembers a lot of numbers that can be recalled later to use. Buttons are a little confusing at first, but it's not hard to catch on to for a sightless person."
4,Ignore that unwanted call,"I like it. It will say the caller number or your recorded ID of the caller (""Mom's cell"", for example)."
5,a good product,I've had this product for 3 years. It's a lifesaver. No more running to the phone to check the caller ID. It let's me know by the number or you can add someones name to let you know who's calling. Also good if you which not to answer the telephone at that particular time and great for when there is more then one person in the household.
3,Great while it worked!,Have only had this for months and one day it was just dead. Tried to make it work again but nothing worked. I liked it so much though I am going to try buying one again!
5,"great device, useful to have a small surge protector","My father has had this particular ID unit for some time, and it works very well. I agree w/ all the other reviews.I had another version/model of a talking ID unit, which recently was fried for a surge/spike from a storm. (I was in the room when it happened.)I recommend using a 3-plug surge protector adapter (one that fits over the electric outlet and not the ""power strip"" version). This will protect the investment from any future, however remote, chances of damage. I got mine @ Walmart."
3,Good & Bad,"This thing works good as far as announcing the calling number. However, when you try to use the programming feature it only lets you enter the information for a split second. If you can talk lightning fast you may be able to get in one word."
3,"Good, but some flaws","I purchased this item about two years ago, so I have some idea about how it works and lasts. It's great to have the caller's name announced, and for the most part, this item works well for a while. However, there are some long-term considerations:Longevity: A number of crystals in the LCD display have gone bad. So, you can't read many of the numbers or letters on the display.Accuracy: I don't know if this is due to its age, but sometimes it announces a wrong programmed name for number. We've picked up the phone expecting one person and found out it was another. It can be embarrassing.I'm looking for another machine and might end up with this model again. It has a lot of features and does work well--for a while."
4,Very good while it lasts.,"This is the second one of these that we've owned. Our first one stopped working after about 18 months. We did not buy the first one from Amazon so we had no avenue for repair or service since ClassCo did not offer any. We missed the convenience of this device, so we relented and bought another. It does work as described by the manufacturer, and is relatively simple to set up and use. In short, it is a great convenience while it works. It would be an excellent asset for folks who are sight impaired."
4,Simple Caller ID for the Technically Challenged,"Plug it in and all of your calls are voice-announced, displayed and easy to review, erase, answer, etc. Great value."
2,Defective out of the box,"The scrollpoint button was sticking in the down position when I plugged it in, and I was unable to get that to stop. Had to return it, and decided not to take my chance with a replacement. I dug out an old mouse I had leftover from a PS/2 and am happily using that."
3,Ok but too simple,Was hoping for more in-depth detail. Pictures are not the greatest. Good for the office to help less experienced co-workers. I'm in the fashion industry.
2,?,"This book is for persons who are just starting out, not tailors. It is good to have reference books in your library but this book has the same construction directions that a vogue men's pattern has in it. If this book costed 5 or 10 dollars it would be worth it but not for this price. Thank you"
1,I Want My Money and Time Back.,What a waste of time and money this movie is... and I'm talking about mine. I rented it and wish I hadn't. I watched about an hour of it and wished I hadn't. Words can't quite describe how horrible everything about this is. Special effects - they look like something Ed Wood might have thrown together. Script - what script? Acting - I've seen better in grade school Xmas plays. This is a definite DO NOT BUY.
3,"Interesting stuff, but way too spacey and experimental","Tadd Mullinix surprised me pleasantly as Dabrye, for after hearing Prefuse 73, I was desperately in search of another artist with similar content. However, this CD is a bit too experimental for my taste, don't expect to dance to this one. Just in the spirit of respecting Tadd for his various interests in electronic genres, I'll give this one 3 stars, I guess."
5,Order was cancelled,"During a pedicure, I found this shade at the salon and requested that it be used and I fell in love with it instantly. Unfortunately, I tried MANY times to order this particular Essie nail polish, but couldn't find it anywhere."
1,"Cheap, Don't Buy If Wanting To Actually Use It","I bought this used, figuring it would be cheap and alright just for fun and to learn solving a rubik's cube for the first time. Boy was that a bad decision. When I received it, the stickers were already coming off as soon as I took it out of the box and there was dirt or something sticky all over it. When I tried turning the sides, it only wanted to turn one way, barely, and you about had to break it to turn it the other way, which just made the stickers come off even more. And it does that for every side. If you just want it for a cheap toy to look at, maybe for a kid, and not use it to actually solve the rubik's cube, I guess it's alright, if kind of expensive. But don't waste your money on this, I regret not just buying an actual rubik's cube. I was very disappointed with this product. I should of listened to the other reviews, instead of buying it for the price, because I just ended up wasting my money in the end."
1,"Don't buy, broke the same day","This is the worst! I am warning you, the work rubik cube out there in the market. I ordered one it was a total piece of junk, it broke the same day just by a single twist. Don't waste your money get an original Rubik Cube."
2,"The product itself was in good condition,","but its instructions were in Japanese. I know the basic rules of Rummy Cube, bat I wanted to read any variations and techniques that they had to tell."
4,Scary and imaginative,"I bought my VHS copy of I Madman from AMAZON.COM a couple years ago. ""Much of Madness, More of Sin"" was Malcomb Brand's first book. Jenny Wright's character becomes hooked on these stories. She also works at a local bookstore and realizes that Malcomb Brand is crazy. She realizes first hand that he is crazy when she sees his face (all the skin is cut off and replaced). At one time he murders a beautiful redhead so he can scalp her and wear her hair. Some pretty scary creatures pop up in her room. Funny special effects. Too bad my tape contains Spanish subtitles.Her boyfriend Clayton Rohner is a one of the cops who think she is crazy and has lost her marbles.I liked Jenny Wright better as a Vampire type sort-of in Near Dark."
5,A Unique Film at It's Best,"This film, while a low budget movie, is a classic as far as I am concerned. It has a unique haunting feel and is a wonderful experience to watch. There is a definate feel of passion, which this movie portrays, but, you also get the excitement of some horror as well. This movie is best watching in the dark. So, grab some popcorn and a soda, then sit down and relax and enjoy this film."
3,Decent B-Movie,"woman is into horror novels discovers this book at the library she works at, while getting into a good book. Copy Cat Murders around her are happening the same as what is written in the book. A well written movie & the same director that did The Gate, I enjoyed seeing the creature effects at the end of the film. check this one out. Worth watching."
2,INTRIGING,"THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. DIFFERENT. JENNY WRIGHT REMINDS ME OF A YOUNG MADONNA. SHE ALSO PLAYED IN NEAR DARK WITH BILL PAXTON & LANCE HENDRIKSON. I MADMAN IS KIND OF NOSTALGIC. INTERESTING & SCARY. A MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE, OR SHOULD I SAY A MOVIE WITHIN A BOOK, OR A BOOK WITHIN A MOVIE? YOU DECIDE."
4,A CLASSIC !,This is a very good & very underrated horror film! The madman in this movie is very creepy! Some of the efx are very out dated but nowhere near bad enough to ruin this awesome classic.
4,Pretty good movie,"Can't complain, it was a pretty good movie. The previous reviews are pretty spot on. I guess it would just depend on the person who watches it. You can't be dissapointed with the movie for the price. Overall worth a watching or two."
2,blah,"This film had a good premise,but the bad acting and poor direction made this laughable and a bit boring for it to bring any chills or scares at all. If you want a better movie,get IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. Avoid this one."
3,This is not a complete Compilation!,"Folks -Simply put, this is not a complete Rodney O & Joe Cooley compilation!How could they leave out ""Supercuts"" ???????That song and ""Everlasting Bass"" are their two biggest jams!""D"" Sooch (Frisco City Floor-Jammers)"
1,Not worth the price tag.,"This book could probably be shortened to 100 pages max.There are TOO many pictures/tables in the book that have nothing to do with the text and the pictures/tables aren't even explained.This book lacks organization.Was not what I expected. Only a handful of sentences helped me understand how we arrived at the modern alphabet from pictograms (pictures that represent words)If you want a book that explains the evolution of written language from pre-history, this is NOT the book for you!"
2,"Simplistic, Cutesy, Questionable Conclusions","This book looked fun and since I enjoy reading about languages and writing how could I go wrong? It is not a really bad book. There are errors in all books but as one reviewer notes, these should not be about your subject matter.Here it is - we have a brief, illustrated history and the assumption (unproven) that the ancient Israelites were the developer of the alphabet which evolved and transformed as it spread around the world. I do not know for sure that this is not the case but what I do know is that the author presents scant evidence for his contention. The ""ABC"" portion of the book was helpful only if one were looking at Hebrew or Greek since the order followed the Hebrew alphabet. The book is not worth the money."
4,"Excellent planning tool, nice design, a bit pricey.","I realized that all of my work projects have a 3-month horizon or less; looking at those months on the wall are a more efficient solution than a whole year. I like the design very much: Buff paper, dark gray type, dark red rules. Looks good in an office. What sets this calendar apart from the others is that the current month is always at the top of the page...so you are always looking 3 months ahead. Useful and tasteful. My only disappointment is that it feels a few bucks overpriced."
4,Good and fast responce.,I recieved the memory within a couple of day. I like the fast turnaround.I would have no problem doing business with this company again.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This movie that is advertised as Beyond Obsession with Henry Thomas is NOT!! The movie that is being sold is Beyond Obsession with Tom Berenger, and it is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. BEWARE OF THIS TITLE, the other movie with Henry Thomas is a real good movie but not avail. at this time. Amazon finaly fixed the DVD ad but not the VHS ad."
1,my review -,movie was hard to understand - too many twist and turns. i bought this for $1 at the dollar store. i started tom beringer - plot was hard to keep up with - felt like a B movies. if you like movies that are vague and don't have a clear point. buy it.
1,Don't Buy!,The item they are listing are not the right moive they are really talking about star some guy named Tom Beringer. It's a movie with the same name. I'm still trying to fix this and get my money back what a rip off.
5,perfume,my friend was highly delighted with the product i am sure i will be buying morethanks Pete Linton
3,I love LouLou but...,"I do believe they have changed the formula. It used to be so potent and long lasting, this latest bottle was weak and hardly lasted. I am disappointed because it is a gorgeous, sweet rich scent; it used to be anyway."
2,"OK, But...","All instrumental and I don't really need another ""Jeff Beck album"". Peter, please go back to being yourself, I miss you!"
5,Does come alive,"Excellent 5 star baby- tasteful guitar work- In historical reference,...nothing here to beat the impact of first hearing ""Do You Feel Like I Do"" on the radio ( the obligitory comparison)but out of that whole double album,how much did you really just love? Most of us still around and alive have probably mellowed a bit and speaking for myself,...I like something that soothes the poor head now rather than banging the gong at full stimulation for an hour,..if ya know what I mean-So it is in that vein that I highly recommend this one-Every track is a winner in my humble opinion-Thank you Mr. Frampton"
5,GREAT GUITAR CD!,"never knew Frampton could play this great. Best secret weapon in rock from what I could hear on this disk. Album reminds me of a Steve Howe solo cd, but with more of a harder rock feel too many of the songs. he also does some great mellow and gypsy jazz type songs. very very enjoyable cd with eclectic mix of different styles of music. [...]"
5,One of the Baddest A$$ guitar cds around!,"I saw Peter Frampton back in the 90's wedged in between Mike Tramp of White Lion and Lynyrd Skynyrd. I knew (at that time) of PF from Frampton Come Alive (along with 6 million plus others!) and was blown away by his virtuousness on stage. His chops were amazing then, and on this CD, well like they say about fine wine...just gets better with age. I am not a fan of instrumental cds...but this is special, in a unique way, because it came out of left field from an artist who musical career has been defined by 1 live album, and in my eyes, a Humble Pie legacy!...great stuff indeed!"
4,Peter does it again...,"I know that Peter is constantly compared to the huge success of Frampton Comes Alive, which is incredibly hard to match...but Fingerprints is a great contribution. I was lucky enough to hear him play Black Hole Sun live before the CD was released, and I basically bought the whole CD because of that one track. The man is a guitar genius, and the fact that he's an incredibly nice guy to boot just makes it easier to buy his stuff and help line his pockets for retirement. ;-)"
5,Frampton Very Much Alive!,"This is just a great cd, especially if you like guitar based music. It's got gifted players, with well crafted licks. It's an album I'll be able to listin to over and over, and certainly will become an old favorite. I knew Frampton was good, but was a little surprised by the quality of this work as a whole. There isn't a klunker on it, it's in no way repetitive, or hakneyed. The licks sound fresh, even though there are still hints of his style that I expected. As the other reviews stated, many different styles are in the song mix. Like the sound bite in the song ""Grab a Chicken"", ""it's crispy, delicious, awesome, check it out!"
3,Frampton is great!,"I'm a big Frampton fan and love his guitar work, but an instrumental CD has to be exceptional, and to me this one isn't. The band is great, the recording is great, but the songs just fall a little short of greatness. I don't want to be too harsh, because I'm rating this on my taste. The next person may love this CD. My advice is to give it a try and decide for yourself. Frampton obviously worked hard on the music. I guess it just isn't for me."
3,3+,"Back in the 70's I thought Frampton was too pop for my tastes. But, I saw him do a television morning show and play the Black Hole Sun. I decided to purchase Fingerprints based on that fantastic performance. Frankly, the Morning Show performance was stellar, the CD version paled.As for the rest of the CD. It is good, sort of like a Jan Ackkerman (sp)release in that it covers a bunch of styles and, IMHO, didn't quite pull out the stops. But it is good. Don't get me wrong.The morning show appearance was GREAT."
3,uneven results,"I think it's an OK album, containing a few excellent versions by Frampton & collaborators but also a few bland covers."
5,Mesmerizing!,"Peter Frampton is better than ever. This album is mesmerizing especially ""Float"" - a must have album. If you don't have it yet, get it."
3,Could Have Been Better.,"Lost Sides has a few must-have tracks(Darker, Break Me Gently (Incidental), Down To Sea, Your Shadow Lay Across My Life, Valley, Crunch and Far From Grace) but most of this album consists of fillers.Tracks such as Blue Water, Analog Bass, Blues Tune, Fourty Five, Suitenoise, Man Who Told Everything (Summer Mix) and Acoustic No.1 would have done nicely to fill the dissapointing tracks on this cd, however the bonus disc makes up for the letdown first disc. Remixes of the songs Words, The Last Broadcast, The Sulphur Man and Satellites and very quality. Recommended for collectors but for those who just want quality tracks your better off downloading the songs above from the internet.(...)"
3,disappointing,"Didn't check carefully. Since I had lost souls ( allright) and last broadcast( fantastic), I had all the songs except a few of which I love 2, not enough to justify the purshase for me. The double album version may be worth it but it's not cheap. Worth it if you're a fan."
4,fan must-have,"Too much great stuff on here makes up for the incidental music bits that are pretty inconsequential. But at least half of this CD is very worth having. If you like their 2 other CD's, this is a no-brainer"
3,"It's ""Lost Sides"" for a reason...","But that doesn't mean everything here isn't worthwhile. These tracks are mostly B-sides and a few instrumentals that were not worked into a main album. Doves fans will appreciate it, but if you have just heard of this band, start with ""Last Broadcast"" or ""Kingdom of Rust"" instead. ""Darker"" is the track that really stands alone, and IS MY FAVORITE SONG BY THIS BAND. I wish they would approach a sound like this again. It's worth more than it costs... ""Far From Grace"" and ""Willow's Song"" are good, but easily forgettable. Everything else is just ok, but still worth a listen."
2,For Decoration Only- Very hard to Play or tune properly- beautiful addition to a music studio,This sitar looks beautiful but if you are looking for a playable sitar to take seriously then this one is not for you. A beginner's sitar or introduction to how a sitar functions. Its worth the money but serious sitar student should look elsewhere. Mine is a beautiful addition to my recording studio and can produce the right notes if you know how to tune it. It does not stay in tune very long and I was a bit dissapointed. That said it is still fun for EXPERIMENTATION OR INTRODUCTION to what a sitar is and can sound like
2,Not so happy,"I purchased this for my son who wanted a real sitar but is only 7. I chose this because another review stated it was perfect for aspiring musicians which led me to believe it could be played and would produce music. Not so! The strings are like the ones you would find on a cheap toy guitar purchased for $1.99. Although the sitar looks nice from a distance, an up close look reveals a very sloppy finish and paint job. My son has lost all interest in this ""instrument"" and I would not give it higher than 2 stars."
5,A must have book for all discus people,"After reading the book,I became able to understand more about the fish they call 'King' of the fresh water aquarium. Both of these men have years of experence in breeding and care of these fish. Jack Wattley has introduced new stirains to the fish world by cross-breeding . I found the color photos in the book to be best stills I have seen in years."
3,Prefer single-blade razors,"While this product did the job, it left me with irritating ingrown hairs. The blades are relatively expensive too. I moved to a double-edged, single blade razor and have not regretted it. It was gentler on the skin, the shave was better and I hardly had any ingrown hairs. The double-edged, single blade is much cheaper too, so it was a win-win change."
3,Not quite up to standard.,"I got this blade in the mail a few years ago, Gillette sent this out to potential customers.I tried it and it's a decent blade. They use 3 blades, but while it is better than single or double blades, the swivel effect from the razor itself makes getting cut by the blades rather easy. I got a cut at least 2 times a month. It would leave me a bit irritated too. The price for the blades were a bit much too.The strips wore down rather quickly, but I've moved onto the Schick Quattro and haven't looked back since."
4,Beautiful Music with Views of the Carribean,"If you are looking for beautiful relaxing guitar music played by world class musicians, you will not be disappointed ... unless, of course you actually wanted to watch videos of them playing! The video portion features ""the exhilarating beauty of carribean vistas"" rather than performance footage of the guitarists. If you counted on observing Manuel Barrueco's technique, you may be as aghast as I was to find the gigue from Bach's 4th lute suite accompanied by views of an iguana! The performances are excellent, however, and duplicate those on the CD by the same name."
2,not a fun game,"I don't think that my expectations were too high. It was a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law, who loves Lucy. We played it after she opened it, and I found myself wishing the game was over. It was embarrassing how terribly boring it was."
2,Not what I expected.,"I thought this game was something different. If you are a true hard core I Love Lucy fan don't bother. The questions are like ""What color is Lucies hair?"" Really? Spend you money else where. We opened it and sold it at a garage sale the next month for 3 bucks."
5,Simply Outstanding with a Simple Understanding,"A lovely collection of calligraphic artwork reflecting on assorted passages from the Scriptures. The make of the book is durable, and the pages are thick. Because the assortment is so wide and the artist offers little comments with each piece, it feels very personal to read and view. I think it was a good choice to use a less literal translation: out of such simple English lyrics come such a beauty - who can refrain from meditating more on the hidden beauty of the Scriptures?This would be a great thing to share with young kids, too; not only for looking at, but also for imitating. This sort of artwork is both fun and meditative, great for memorization exercises and - who knows? - you may end up cultivating a talent that's often under-represented among believers."
2,Door Posts,I ordered this book because the vendor said that it was in like new condition! It was for a gift--I did not give it for the following reason. The book had stamped in it the library where it came from and it was NOT anywhere new looking--it definitely was in used condition and not very good condition. I learned my lesson and will only purchase new books when giving them as gifts!
2,Looks cheap...,It looks really cheap. Strap is flimsy and not worth 50$ and DEFINITELY not worth $250. I got this hoping to use it as a gift but it didn't look high-quality at all. I had to return it.
1,Poor!!!,"I bought this ""Prada"" handbag for my wife. We feel very disappointed with the handbag that we received. It looks very different compared to that of in the picture, especially the strap. The body of the handbag is still ok, but the strap is really pulling down the overall of the handbag. This ""Prada"" handbag looks very cheap! :-("
1,Shame on you Amazon!,"OMG! Are they making people pay through the nose for fakes?! On all of the authentic Prada's I've seen, the emblem is raised. The emblems on the Prada's here aren't. Reading the reviews of the ""Prada"" bags here, I see nothing but complaints. I Love Amazon...for books, DVD's, CD's. But, I'll get my Prada's elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this work; I expected something more ""traditional"" and less ""experimental"" sounding. I'll probably donate my copy to the local public library."
4,Not their best album,"This release is more mellow than Piccolo Amore. While the music is very nice, it never really appealed to me. I guess I got hooked on their happier songs from before. Worth trying if you are a R&P fan."
3,bettet than you know,This movie is one of the first movies that tells some truth about crack. Because this is a movie some parts are just for entertainment but all in all this movie is pretty good. I say its a pretty good movie to start to learn how the crack trade started. After watching this movie read some of the books by gary webb or do a web search on ricky ross and you will be surprised what you find.
3,kilos,"I have become interested in the career of Glen Plumer since his breif appearancein the Sean Penn Vehicle Colors, but more Note wothy South central. I purchasedKilos on a whem not knowing much about it, but I like the little underated movies he's appeared in so far, so I decided to give it a chance. there's not thatmuch to the story but the movie does have it's moments. I think his movies don'talways have the A list as far as production gos but its far above a B movie asfar as acting and production. So I recomend renting it first, but I must saythat I'm not sorry that I purchased it."
4,"Dacau, an inmate's view",Gun was a Turkish journalist who wound up in Dachau. His story is compelling and detailed. It centers on the day the Americans showed up and liberated the camp.
4,"good pick me up, taste suffers just a little","I am hooked. Im ordering around 16 cans a month now. Its a better energy drink than the rest, like red bull or Monster. I like the cola taste ok, the others are kinda pukey. The cola taste for me is better than red bull and monster, and the boost from this product is far superior to the others, largely because of its higher caffeine content. I think you are limited in taste by the taurine, but this cola is the best product on the market now for me."
2,Works. But makes me shake,"Works, but makes me shaky. I didn't buy more because of this. There were times I felt I'll and was worried I'd pass out."
2,First and Last Time For This Flavor,"I like the Green Tea Raspberry. I had not tried this Cola flavor before and ordered the smallest pack which was four. I did not like this flavor and will not order it again. Besides not liking the flavor, the shipping was too high."
4,Inspirational (words are impossible),"I have listened to the best of Margie Joseph, and that particular song, ""Words Are Impossible"", has given me knowledge, wisdom, strength, and understanding to make it through my life. It's a song that you can reminisce, wonder and wish you can do it all over again. It's one of the best."
3,This book is ok.,"I think that this book is good, it is very discriptive, and i think that it gives a good explanation of every character. The main character, Aggie is very realistic, and seems like a very down to earth kind of girl. I would recomend this novel to anyone who likes novel like this, (romance and a little bit of excitement at the same time)"
2,Not completely accurate,"This book really should be called ""Beans to MILK Chocolate"". It describes the process of making chocolate but states that ""the paste is mixed with powdered milk and sugar"".Milk in fact, is just an optional ingredient and this book leads people to believe that chocolate has to be made with powdered milk.I agree with the other reviewer that this book is very short, but that is what this series is like. They are short introductory books that don't overwhelm young readers (which I can appreciate)."
3,Rather self-conscious,"Either the editor has a very heavy hand or all these writers went to the same writing school. There are several good stories here but the writing felt pasteurized somehow... I wouldn't say this is a bad book, but it seems to be trying very hard to be ""literary."" One of the most disappointing stories was from Linda Jaivin, whose ""Eat Me"" book is a bit of a classic in this genre. Can't recommend this book, unfortunately."
3,"Great recordings, but not the original hits.","This CD contains some great recordings by Stevie B, but they are NOT the original hit recordings that you hear on the radio or on the original singles or albums. Some reviews say that these recordings are re-mixes, but in my opinion, they are actually completely ""re-recorded versions"" rather than re-mixes. When I say completely re-recorded, I mean... totally new vocals, new instrumentation, and new mixing. So, if you are someone who is trying to collect all the original freestyle recordings and hits from back in the day, this CD would NOT be for you. On the other hand, if you just want to hear Stevie B. doing a great job of singing his most well known recordings, you probably will enjoy this CD. Also, if you are a big Stevie B. fan and collector who already has the original recordings and you are just looking for a nice addition to your Stevie B. collection, I would recommend this to you as well!"
1,2 of the 3 chips were functionless,2 of the 3 chips did not work and the seller would not replace them!
5,256 Memory,Simple to insert the new memory. Just make sure you know exactly what is compatable with your computer. New memory works great.
4,Dub Retrospective,"The great Bad Brains have never released a recording as satisfying as this one. Full, phat bottom, distinctive tempo changes, and imaginative (dub) versions of their classic songs make this essential for long time fans. The (limited edition?) import version includes a second disk: 28 live tracks recorded from '82 to '92 with HR leading the full sonic assault for which the group was known. This is the Bad Brains record I've been waiting for since the early '80s."
5,Tasty dub reggae with smatterings of punk,"If you like reggae, dub reggae in particular, BUY THIS CD. I was turned onto this by a friend and have since turned on many other friends to it as well. Each time I try to make them listen for a while and guess who it is. The jaws always hit the floor when I tell them it's Bad Brains. Just goes to show that these guys can hit any genre out the ballpark.The production quality is very very good on this album. It's a wonderful album to use when you're listening to ultra high end audio systems.This album became the soundtrack for my life for about 6 months and if you like dub reggae I think it will for you too."
3,"Hardcore,hard rock fans,this B.B. joint is NOT for you","A change in the weather (slightly). You have 3/4 of BAD BRAINS here (HR must have gotten a sore throat...get it?). You have the musicians to no vocals. Also,the hardcore and hard rocking B.B. does what they seldomly get credit for. They smooth things out reggae style. Disappointing? No,not really. B.B. have thrown monkey wrench reggae tunes on every album except I AGAINST I so it's not a big shocker,stunner,let down. Change is good but if you want it loud and hard,this should be the only studio album to avoid. Reggae fans big up BAD BRAINS into your collection with this."
2,DVD lacks Christmas,"Strangely enough, the majority of the cartoons on this DVD have nothing to do with Christmas. I think the Popeye cartoon has a few seconds of a fist fight in the Swiss Alps. There is snow, and that is as close as it gets. The Hawaiian Birds has a few moments in New York winter, but no connection to the Holidays. Now, I am always happy to have another Popeye cartoon, but I was actually expecting it to be Christmas themed.The DVD quality is about what you come to expect from Cartoon Crazy's. The picture is fine, the sound can be a little weird but I like it, and the extras are mainly adds for their other titles.If you are looking for a collection of classic Christmas cartoons, they did a much better job with their second outing, ""A Cute Cavalcade of Classic Christmas Cartoons."" The best cartoons on this DVD, ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,"" ""Christmas Comes But Once a Year ,"" and ""The Shanty were Santa Claus Lives,"" are duplicated on ""A Cute Cavalcade..."""
3,Classic Cartoons... What's with the sound?,"This is definately one of the better collections available in the Cartoon Crazys series. Unlike a lot of their other DVDs, it includes many classics that to my knowledge are not available anywhere else at this time. I reccomend this DVD to anyone who likes old campy cartoons that seem to have little or no point. Like any other Cartoon Crazys DVD though, the sound is a major draw back... and it is the only reason I give it three stars instead of four or five. For some reason, the folks at Fox Lorber have decided to ""enhance"" the sound by adding unnecessary sound effects. This would be fine and wonderful if the sounds blended in with the cartoon. Instead, they are a distraction.Cartoons included that Amazon for whatever reason doesn't list below (which is a shame because these three are some of the weirdest in the collection)... Snow Foolings, Christmas Comes But Once a Year (starring Grampy from Betty Boop), and Christmas Night (starring the Little King)"
3,"Pretty Good, but could be better","The added sound effects do sound a bit different, but nothing too distracting. The improved video quality more than makes up for it anyway; many of these aren't easily found anywhere else, and definately not looking this good. The best toon on the disc is Max Fleischer's Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, but most are pretty good. The major downer is that several of the cartoons have little to do with Christmas. Bugs Bunny in Fresh Hare has one joke about Santa, and The Hawaiian Birds is set on a tropical islands with no obvious connection to Christmas. A decent collection but a few better choices in content would have improved it's rating from me."
5,FA LA LA LA LA,"The Cartoon Crazys folks did it again with this collection of Christmas related cartoons. Great restorations, as always, make this collection a sure fire hit if you collect Christmas related titles."
2,Really disappointing,"Having read the glowing reviews on here, I was really looking forward to this book. I'm guessing the other reviewers were just happy to have a new Prisoner story, since The Prisoner a) only had 17 episodes; and b) ended in the late 60's. Beyond getting a new story about the Prisoner, though, the book is really pretty terrible. In the first few pages, there's a murder that sets up the rest of the book. Unfortunately, that murder is the only thing happens. The remaining hundreds of pages are Number Six and his new galpal 18 walking back and forth, interviewing people, and shooting each other sarcastic one-liners. That's it. The Prisoner was about a lot more than just snappy come-backs and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect something to actually happen in a story after the initial plot point. Overall, it wasn't the worst thing ever written, but if my copy accidentally fell into my cat's litter box, I wouldn't make an effort to retrieve it."
1,Every bit as good,"Every bit as good as all the previous ""Prisoner"" fiction. If you enjoyed the novels by Disch, McDaniel, etc., you're sure to find this one fascinating as well."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF ITS FREE!,MOST OF THE HC42 CAMCORDERS HAVE AN LCD ISSUE. AFTER 1.5 YEARS OF USE THE LCD STOPS WORKING AND DOES NOT DISPLAY ANYTHING.I HAVE GONE THRU MANY FORUMNS AND HAVE ATLEAST 25 OF THE OWNERS FOR 1.5 YEARS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. WORST OF ALL SONY WILL CHARGE YOU AN EXTRA $250 TO FIX THIS ISSUE THATS SO WIDELY SPREAD.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ANY COST!WHAT A WASTE OF $500+
1,No Usability Research Done,"1. Cannot do live video capture of streaming from a tripod, since the firewire and USB interfaces both require the HandyCam Station to be in place (which covers up the tripod mounts).2. Transferring video from this to a Windows machine is terrible. Works fine with a Mac, but iMovie on the Mac is inadequate for capturing video for use on web. Capturing video on Windows is a nightmare to setup...especially if you use a variety of computers."
2,Not compatible with Mac OS X!,Mac users: beware! Apple iMovie and Apple Final Cut Express will not recognize this camcorder!
1,No free driver on the website to download,"Hi,I have lost the CD rom to download the movie from the camera.Sony does not offer it for free on its website. You have to pay $70 dollars to get it again.That clearly disappoints me."
4,Nice CAM,"I was excited when i received my handy cam . I pictured all Niagra falls , ocean city , washington DC , New york etc etc etc.. The vedio quality was gr8 outdoors and it was just more than what i want...For Indoor the video is not good .. when you shoot at night its not visible and if shot in night mode every thing comes like 1930's black and white, and not real.I also used stills and they were good for 1 mb shots. Outdoors they were as you may want them too but indoor or at night they are useless...So over all it is giving me what i expected it too ..I can safely say it met my expectation with it performance. Not an outstanding deal but really a worthy deal to make ..I recomand this camera to people."
3,Poor Low Light and Indoors performance,"I had recently bought one and returned after observing its poor low light performance. This camcorder gives exceptional quality video in outdoors. In indoors with minimum lighting, it produces below average quality video and grainy pictures even with night shot. Especially if you are planning to shoot lot of video indoors (involving kids, for family events), this is not the right camcorder to buy."
4,Great Camcorder Over DVR,"Real Briefly - this camera is great for Instant Recording. I love the touch screen capability - makes for easy viewing and editing. It can also take still photos on the fly, a great feature. It has steady shot and good options for editing tape (fade etc.) The docking station is easy: rechargeable battery and I had no problems sinking it to my PC to download my pictures with the extra memory stick I bought at time of camera purchase. Not the greatest quality for still photos but something is better than nothing. Keep your digital camera.I was at a party with a friend with a Sony DVR camcorder. It took forever to format the new discs and then she had a fatal disc error and lost all her footage while I kept on shooting no problem.I love this camera!!Overall ****stars b/c of OK still shots."
1,Blank LCD screen issue,"Though this product is good when it works, it is prone to blank LCD issue due to usage. There are many folks out there (including me) who have the problem and Sony is deaf to this issue. Please be aware. I would refrain from buying Sony camcorders (In fact, I bought HD camcorder from other vendor)."
3,Sony is ignoring LCD problem,"I bought a Handycam DCR-HC32 in March of 2006. In June of 2007 the screen went black when trying to record. I called customer service and they said they know of no such problem and its an 'isolated incident.' I checked on several troublshooting message boards and the same LCD problem is found everywhere. I do not understand how Sony says mine is an isolated incident when its happened to so many others, including some of these reviews on Amazon. To top it off it will cost a minimum of $171 to get it repaired. What a waste of my money, last time I will buy a Sony camcorder."
1,Don't buy SONY,"Don't buy any SONY products. SONY is not SONY anymore. Many of their products are crappy and not cutting edge. I bougt a SONY digital camera late last year. It broke within 6 months. I sent it to SONY service center and was told that it would cost more to fix it. I got my money back but bought a Nikon. I also bought this SONY camcorder DCR-HC42. I usually buy the extended warranty, but somehow I forgot to buy an extended warranty on this one. This one broke after 1 and a half years. I contacted SONY and was told that I have to pay $201 to fix it.I'm hearing problems with SONY products from too many people- TVs, camcorders, digital cameras, even alarm-clock radios. Don't buy SONY. SONY is spending too much money on Hollywood, not on technology development."
1,It's not your grandfather's Sony...,"Years ago, Sony stood for undisputed, unrivaled quality that could last for a life time. I have purchased a numbers of Sony products over the past few years all based on the faith.No more.One by one, that trust has eroded with the failing products. My VAIO can barely holds itself together in one piece, then the LCD display of my DCR-HC42 went blank, not to mentioned all the battery problems that Sony produced...Goodbye, Sony! the overpriced, under-quality gizmo brand! You have just lost a loyal customer and I am sure you will lose a lot more..."
2,Mine died after one and half years.,"Picture quality and other features are good as long as it works.If you are buying this make sure that you buy extended warranty.Mine died after one and half years,as per Sony cost of repairing it is more then buying a new one :).I paid $500 for this and it lasted only for 1 and half years even though I rarely used it.I see lot of people having issues with Sony handy cams recently.Do proper research before buying a handycam(google for issues others having with the model you are buying).If you buy this product.... don't forget to buy extended warranty otherwise a small issue might make this handycam useless."
1,LCD problem,"Has LCD problem after 1.5 years of use. After sending numerous emails and talking to customer support, sony wants over $200 to find out what the problem is. From the other postings I see, lot of people have the same issue. Would rather buy a new camcorder than spend over $200 to fix this one."
1,"Stoped working, Doesn't record at all, Sony support wants $269.00 to fix this problem","I purchased this model last year DCR-HC40 on 6-11-2004. It stoped working on 06-22-05.The record button is matfunctioning, So it is not able to record.Also it discharges the fully charged battery, as soon you hit the record button.So when you press record button, it swithes the mode to memory card(like on/off switch does) & discharges battery to 3 min. If you keep on external power, than it keep on swicting between tape/memory card on record button press.I have purchased for $599.00, The sony wants $269.00 to fix this problem. Beware what you getting into. Here is there support no 800-282-2848, if you want to confirm this.Beware!!! What you paying for."
3,"Good point and shoot, but not for professional video","This camera offers descent point and shoot type video. If you're interested in making independent films, I would stay away from this camera. For one, there is ONLY ONE CCD. The camera CAN'T shoot in 24p progressive video mode, you're stuck with lame 29.97fps. That means you'll never get that ""film-like"" feel that film-movie cameras have. There isn't a manual focus ring, you have to focus using MENU controls! The camera also has a CCD the 1/5.5"" in size. This pales incomparison to other cameras with bigger CCDs (like the sony fx1 with 1/3"" CCDs). A bigger CCD means better low light capability. Also the max verticle lines of resolution is 520 lines. This camera can't compete with 1080i type cameras that have over TWICE the verticle lines. But it's a good camera for those who can't (or don't want to) spend $40K on a professional digital camera. So don't buy this camera if you're interested in making professional feature films."
3,Below-average movie quality on a widescreen TV,"I have a very nice Sony W1 digital camera with an incredible VGA movie mode (640x480 30fps). However, since I recently purchased a 480p widescreen plasma TV, I decided to buy this camcorder just for the so-called true 16x9 recording mode.Yes, it does record in 16x9, but the quality of the video is very poor. You see a fair amounts of noise and pixels ont he screen. I've tried several things:- DV tape played back on the TV- Indoor movie- Outdoor movie (good amount of sun)- DVD burning- Same thing using my digital cameraResult: my digital camera takes the same quality (if not better) movies than this camcorder.The only difference is the aspect-ratio: my VGA movies do get stretched while the 16x9 don't.Conclusion: while I didn't expect HD quality of course, I did however expect a better movie experience than with my digital camera. Apart from the aspect-ratio being good, the quality of the movies recorded is grainy and pixelized."
2,Watch out for 2 year lcd problem,I bought this camera (DCR HC 42) in 2005 and it worked very well until recently. The lcd screen has gone blank after going dim and off-color first (this all happened within 2 days).The viewfinder is still functioni ng but the lcd gives access to all the features which were responsible for me choosing this camera. Several post on other websites seem to indicate that this is a flaw with this camcorder so invest in additional warranty.
1,LCD Doesn't Work - Sony Wants $211 to Repair It,I purchased this Camcorder a little more than a year ago. While on a recent vacation the display stopped working. Can still take movies and stills but what good is it if you can't review the movies or photos. Called SONY to inquire about replacing the LCD. The warranty was up (one year)and they would repair it for $211. It appears from other reviews that Sony has a problem but won't admit it.
2,4 years.,I have had this Sony Handycam for 4 years. I have had it repaired once. It has been broken for over a year now off and on. I would power reset the camera and it would work for a week then have internal problems again.I called Sony about my warranty and they wont acknowledge it. So if I wanted to get it fixed. I would have to send it to TEXAS and pay $237 for repairs.Over all I loved this camera for 2 years. I bought it went it first came out in 2005. So for awhile I had fun making videos. Now I am looking to buy a new one. Of course I can buy this one for dirt cheap now but there are better models out today I am looking into. So should you.
4,"If you like vibes, you'll love this.","I owned a vinyl copy of this album that got destroyed a number of years ago, so I was excited to find it finally released on CD. Gary Burton's playing on this album is creative, thoughtful, of a very high quality. I have never tired of listening to this album. Give it a try, I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised."
4,guillow kit,"got this kit. so you want to build a balsa kit...total fun until you want to paint it. you need to develop this skill before you try it on the kit you just built. guillow no longer has any paints.soo..when you go to the hobby store.you will find out you are on your own, a lost art .they will tell you to make a test set up a grid with balsa sticks and doped tissue ...and try to see what diffent paints do to it....do it or you will ruin your kit..if you followed guillows book and use wood glue as a dope. the tissue will sag with each painting....good luck, these kits are not for the faint of heart..the guy at our local hobby store started to buid one tossed it in the trash. went back to plastic."
2,OrgPlus Version 4.0,"I purchased OrgPlus Version 4.0. It indicated on the front of the box integrated data management, publish to web, publish to PDF, Excel Integration. It even has a paragraph on the back of the box with ""OrgPlus the complete solution!"" Well, much to my surprise it fails to tell you that if want to do any integration items listed on the box or use with other software you have to ""upgrade"" to a more expensive version, but you are not told that until you load the program and start getting little pop-up boxes saying you can't do this without upgrading. I was very disappointed in this Version 4.0 OrgPlus, especially it's packaging, which was very misleading."
5,Outstanding Product,"This mop does such a GREAT JOB that it's fun to use because the Starfiber MicroPlus Mop it is quick, simple and effective."
1,Creationism propaganda,"This comic book will make anyone with a science education cringe. The ""friendly conversation about evolution"" is in fact a one sided, missleading, collection of fringe pseudoscience writen by creationists for creationists. In a comic adventure, the reader is led through a debate between a creationist and a evolutionist on the subject of evolution. The side of the evolutionist is not based on fact, but rather purposefully misleads the reader. The idea of ""Intelligent design"" promoted in this book, has been banned from the public school science classrooms by the 5th circuit court of appeals: ""that curriculum proposals for ""intelligent design"" are equivalent to proposals for teaching ""creation science"". (Freiler v Tangipahoa Board of Education, No. 94-3577 (E.D. La. Aug. 8, 1997). On August 13, 1999, the 5th circuit court of appeals affirmed the ruling. My opinion, keep this book away from your children."
1,Not so intelligent,"There is no scientific proof to support the intelligent design belief. There is, on the other hand, a massive amount of proof to support the scientific theory of evolution. That proof includes the fossil record and DNA.Scientists don't have to disprove intelligent design's belief in some supernatural intelligence. The believers in intelligent design do, on the other hand, need to provide scientific evidence to support their view if they want it to be considered science.After reviewing this book briefly I was disappointed to find that there was no scientific evidence to support the belief in intelligent design. I don't think intelligent design should even be compared to evolution until it can actually stand up to the scientific method."
1,"I got fooled, should have read the reviews!","This is not a book about Darwin or evolution or science.Instead, it's a very well done attempt to argue that even though creationists are dead wrong in their rejection of scientific fact, there is still room for those who argue that God is responsible for the ""big"" kinds of evolution. That an intelligent creator is responsible for birds and fish and people, and that evolution is limited to moths changing color.Nothing wrong with making this argument (room for all points of view) but I don't buy it, and the cover and title tricked me into buyiing the book."
4,"awsome, but i'm picky!","WOW, these were great, are great! the sound is super good for a $30 heeadphones. the inline volume controll works way better the the old sony ones i had. the paded head peace is very soft and very well made, these fit my head like a glove... or hat i geuss. i only really have two complants, 1. they sit funny on your head( fit great) just look a little silly. 2. i wish the cord came out of only one side instead of both... but whatever. buy these if you want studio style headphones withouth the stupid-long cord!! way better the the $30 sony ones i used to have!"
2,Hard Hitting New Paperback Edition,"At first glance, I was intrigued with the title: ""My Life Tailing Paris Hilton."" But then I realized this book was written by her dog and not Greek shipping heirs.After carefully reading into the intricate clues of The Tinkerbell Code, I found this incredible admission from the little pooch: ""The Valtrexx was mine."" Stunning. It's there. If you follow the clues.""Beware the blonde of Man."""
1,From Tinkerbell to 5 Year Olds,"I saw this book at my local book store, so I leafed through it. I gave in to my curiosity. This is a book written for 5 y/o's. The reading level is just THAT low."
5,SRV book,"I received the book and it was in better condition than I truly expected. Also, it was shipped immediately and arrived sooner than I was anticipating. Wonderful transaction with a great supplier."
2,Depressing book,"Seven years after Stevie Ray's tragic death I was able to bring myself to finally pick up a biography to read something about his life. Unfortunately, this book was the one I found and bought. It is very average, but then again I didn't have very high expectations of these two writers.The information presented is very poorly structured and leaves a lot to be desired. The authors tend to flashback very often and in unnatural places that make the flow very uneven and annoying.I had more questions after reading this book than before I read it. I wouldn't buy this one. Just wait for an authorized biography to come out"
5,Easy read,I bought this book wanting to learn more about Stevie Ray Vaughn and I think it delivered well.It made me more a fan of his and feel deeply saddened by his un timely death. Anyone that wants to know about Stevies early life and about the people around him should get this book. It follows him from when he got his first guitar as a child and his relationship with his brother jimmy vaughn through his rise to stardom the excess the drugs and booze through to him getting clean and sober and onto the awful night in the mountains when he was killed . A sad story .I would recommend this book to anyone.
2,an odd and disjointed romance,"Here's the basic plot: Madison is a savvy business-exec type heroine (if you've read other Leclaire books, think Tess Lonigan) who carefully watches out for the financial well-being of her whimsical, eccentric relatives. But when those same relatives call in Harry Jones, cutthroat financial advisor and son of Madison's grandmother's romantic interest, are they doing it because they don't trust Madison, or could they have a little matchmaking in mind?This book's a bit hard to get through--the pacing's erratic, important information pops up out of nowhere, and the eccentric relatives don't get as much character development as they should. Plus, Madison's major insecurities are not fully explained til the last four pages or so of the story. It's also just kind of crude in places. Skip it, I'd say."
2,Buy this only if you can read very fine print,"I've read the other reviews of this map, and my impression is that most of the reviews pertain to the London Eyewitness Travel Guide, which is a 432-page book that is indeed an outstanding guide to London. (I would give it 5 stars.) HOWEVER, the Eyewitness Travel City Map for London is totally different. It is a sturdy 12-page laminated map that folds out into a single sheet. It has very good detail on the central London area that is frequented by most tourists. However, the print is so tiny that I find its usefulness very limited. It is good for getting a general idea of how central London is laid out, but unless you have the ability to read very small print, it is not helpful in navigating the streets of London."
2,"An index of London, not really a guidebook","I took this book and Frommers to London. This book lists everything,and yet at the same time can be vague when it comes to directions, prices and if something is worthwhile or not. It's an index rather than a guide book. The Frommer's book was as if someone went to London before you did and came back with the good places and sites that you should go to, including restaurant recommendations that I find to be on the money. I'm going to Italy next month and will be taking a Frommer's guide since it gives me prices, times, and what's worth seeing. And...while the individual graphics in this book are good, overall the book is too cluttered."
5,A Must Have,"We only spent a few days in London but this book helped us to plan which sights we'd have time to see. It also has a great map of the tube which helped us, more than once, find our way around Central London. A Must Have!"
4,"Very good and very visual, but lacks more detail","I am going to be travelling to Europe soon and I was looking for new books. I got the eyewitness london guide because of all the images it has. It is a really nice book and really entertaining and the suggested tours are good.My only complain with the book is that it is not so informative about prices like other guides. I would recommend getting this guide just for the visual aspect, but maybe consider buying like the Let's Go London Or Lonely Planet London guide books for budget travellers because they give you ALL the prices informations on everything from transport, restaurants, entrances to sights, etc. For example in London's case, the eywitness guide just mentioons the travel cards to get around but doesn't give information on prices which do come in the Let's Go and LP series."
2,Suspiciously Overrated,"This is a very pretty book. It is very low on content, high on pictures. It has a very useful map and tube map. Personally I prefer more history and explanation in a tour book.It is also heavy. I would not choose to carry this book with me."
4,Worked great,"Bought this book years ago, just for fun, and always loved flipping through it. This summer I went to London for the first time and brought the book with me, though I thought--It's too pretty to be useful. I was wrong! It's a great travel book. The map in the back saved me a couple times when my huge Michelin map didn't quite do the trick. The street-by-street maps are really helpful. It hits all the right highlights. I did not use the hotel/restaurant guides, however, so I have no opinion on that. But as a sights-to-see guide, I can't recommend it enough."
5,THE BEST,I have used the previous edition of this outstanding guide on several trips to London. It is the BEST travel guide I have ever used! Highly recommended.
5,An excellent guide!,"I had to go on a college trip and i had been in London almost a decade ago from 2000,tis guide helped me a lot,it has a lot of info on tourist spots,restaurants,shopping,it has details such as which metro station is near,the address the phone the special features,it has a metro guide a ittle tricky but as soon as you do your first metro try you will use it like a native.It has also general infos on taxi cabs,money,and i strongly advise you to buy it as a fantastic guide not only for London but as a series part."
4,Excellent but no attitude,"This is the tour book equivalent of the one volume encylopedia. Covers the topic well, but not much in the way of attitude. However, if you have limited time to see the tourist attractions, this is probably the best on the market. If you want to see the ""real"" London, get a Rough Guide or the Time Out Guide to London. You'll find out not only what to see, but what's not worth the bother."
5,Eywitness Travel Guide to London,"We've used this guide while taking a Boy Scout Troop to London, twice. Each boy had his own copy, and they not only read it, but they used it frequently. They enjoyed using the building 'cut away' pictures to find all sorts of details. It was like a scavenger hunt. Finding the buildings, locations and other things they had read about 'back home' was a thrill. One item they enjoyed was the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner. Not something we would have thought of, but it intrigued the boys when they read about it and they enjoyed it when they got there. This book is a great help to people of all ages who are discovering London for the first time."
1,Give me a freakin' break....,"This album is so simplistic and terrible, I was not able to ever listen to the whole thing w/o fast-forwarding or skipping songs. I mean it's a freakin' joke when you compare these amateur hacks with Kreator, Sodom or the new kings of Germany: Dew-Scented! I honestly don't see what anyone sees in this record, or this joke of a band...."
3,Not Quite Right,"Guillows missed a bit on this model. They apparently felt that a Piper Cheroke and a Beech Musketeer were identical AND THEY'RE NOT. The wings and cowling in this kit are Cheroke parts. They did get the shape of the fuselage correct, but it looks all wrong with the Cherokee cowling in place. I had to make a new cowling with the Beech down and back sloping chin and the rectangular air inlets. The wing tips were totally the wrong shape, but easily fixed with the extra material included in the kit. But if you don't know what a Beech Musketeer looks like this is a typical Guillows kit; well engineered and fun to build (just not too accurate)."
3,Missing Important Information...,"The very important thing that this DVD is missing is participation from Andy. They could have at least have talked to him and gotten his take on things. I was really interested in hearing what he thought about things, the musical inspirations he had while putting ""Rio"" together and everything else. I miss him."
5,Maybe it's TOO good.,"Rio is just about a perfect album. It's got fantastic hits we all know (Rio, Hungry Like the Wolf, Save a Prayer) a few awesome album cuts that could have easily been hits (Hold Back the Rain, My Own Way, Last Chance on the Stairway) and some arty, darker songs that showed just how talented these guys were (the Chauffeur, New Religion). It might be too good-there was no way they'd ever top it.The extras are fantastic--the original U.S. releases are still my favorites, as I grew up with them, and prefer them to the UK versions. The b-sides are all great.The only downside is that it's the only reissue that didn't come with videos and live concert footage, but there's no shortage of that elsewhere. A wonderful album and package. Too bad it didn't come out 15 years ago when we all really wanted it and would have bought it."
3,"Nice start, but hoped for more.","Overall, its nice to hear more about the making of this classic album. However, I felt there was WAY too much focus on the videos than the actual album itself. Unlike other installments of the Classic Albums series, this focused more on the videos than the ""Behind the Scenes"" of actually making the songs and what went into them and not a lot of ""track by track"" breakdown as normally seen in this series. Its ok, but I just felt it could have been so much more, especially when compared to the other ""Classic Albums"" series."
5,Insights from the Band,"It's cool getting insights into some of the tracks from Simon, Nick, John...and Roger even speaks, quite a bit! Too bad about Andy not participating, for whatever the varied reasons, but I'm glad they acknowledged his work.I wish they had covered all of the songs on the album.It might have been interesting to get commentary from some of their other contemporaries too, or maybe more time with the guys. I'm not sure why Bob Geldof got as much screen time as he did.All in all, though, it was very fascinating and worth adding to any Durannie's collection.Unlike the reviewer who had problems with their disc, mine played fine."
1,Don't Judge a book by it's cover,"I started reading this book and unfortunately it was too irritating when the author ""bashes"" Catholic traditions and beliefs. At the same time he imposes his religious beliefs concerning relics, saints and the Apostles, which is not what the reader pays to buy this book. This book is written in a very biased point of view and not from a serious and unbiased researcher's point of view. I wanted facts and research , not a lesson in religion. I closed the book empty handed. The book may have an interesting title, but it was too much filled with the author's religious beliefs in a way that a reader that does not share his beliefs might find it a very unpleasent experience.For a more balanced book I strongly recommend ""The Twelve: The Lives of the Apostles After Calvary"" by Bernard Ruffin, C. Bernard Ruffin"
4,Good read for the novice theologian,This is a very good read for that person who desires perspective into the possible mindset of the first leaders of the church. Its refreshing to realize that they were people touched by God and not saints dropped from heaven.
1,Sketches?????,"There are no sketches in this book, not happy with the book, also textwas bad, reprinting job not good. Don't bother with this book."
5,THUNDER Strikes Hard,"Dynamo, Mentor, Noman. When I discovered THUNDER Agents I felt like I had fallen into some alternate reality where Marvel and DC combined to create this series. This series has the anything can happen feel of DC's Silver Age along with the pathos of the early Marvels.The art is top notch and the stoires feel like they are moving in a unified direction. A fun step away from the all too familiar Marvel Universe of the 1960s."
2,Lacking THUNDER,"This is really good stuff. Wallace Wood, Gil Kane and company certainly helped raise the bar on comic book art in the mid-sixties. The work is beautifully colored and the reprint quality is superior. However, if you are looking meaningful work from some of comicdom's true masters you may wish to look elsewhere. This work falls far short of Gil Kane's and Wallace Wood's best comic book work. The stories are entertaining but overly simplistic and predictable. There are continuity flaws throughout the THUNDER Agents series.There are four enjoyable issues in this volume. That's right--only four issues. I was hoping for more. Volume #2 only takes you through issue #7. For this price, the original issues of The T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents can readily be had in decent condition. I'm glad someone, DC Comics in this case, has finally given us a archives version of this series. ..."
4,Rocking Dino,"I have had the rocking dino since christmas 2008 and my 1 yr old son loves it. It it beautifuly made, also has 4 songs to rock to that are not to loud and bothersom. I like the rockin dino alot it and would say it is worth buying....I did not give to many star ratings because I have not had it long....."
1,Not as described....,The Danny Dinosaur that was shipped to me was nothing like the product described above. He didn't resemble the picture and looked very cheap. This one played 4 songs- all of which were associated with 4 different shapes that were on the back of his head. The horns made no sounds. I have a son so I thought that the Godzilla roar would be really fun for him. My version didn't have that! Only the 4 songs that really weren't that cute. This was to be a Christmas gift so I a really disappointed...
4,Hear Danny roar,"The chiming music is o.k. enough. Danny takes top spot because his roar is actually that of Godzilla. Yeah, it's not high on volume but they went the extra bit to get the King of all Monsters. My 18 month old can rock in style now."
4,Cute Dinosaur,"I originally saw the rock-a-bye rockers at Sam's club last christmas, and I absolutely loved them, however at the time my son was only 2 months old so I decided to wait, but It was definatly worth it, As of now my son is only nine months and I have to hold him on the rocker and rock him as all he is really interested in is chewing on Danny's horns, so he works great as a rocker and doubles as a teething toy! He is absolutely adorable and I know danny will grow with him and be passed down in the family for years to come (built very durably)."
4,"Cute, but sounds are not loud enough","I bought danny dinosaur for my neice, and it is very cute. The only thing is that the music is somewhat hard to start (have to squeeze the horns) and it is a little hard to hear."
1,Modugno gets a lot better,Domenico Modugno is a master. The man who brought Volare to the Eurovision Song contest for Italy and did not win - has there ever been a more popular song that did not win? This recording of his music does not do him justice though. Avoid this cd unless you have a chance to listen to it first.
4,a fan from Malta,Although not the best but still a good choice from Domenico's songs. A good recording that will help keep Modugno popular for many years to come.
4,Learning to Trust Again,"Professor Madison Evans goes on sabbatical on the Virginia West Coast. She meets handsome antiques dealer Antonio Gates and ends up under his spell. Tony is resistant to romance, but he is smitten with Madison. Can they both overcome mistrust, betrayal to love once again? Very enjoyable book. Sensual, comical and had that one character you loved to hate. Mama Lou was may favorite. Excellent read and a nice ending."
3,Another Match by Mama Lou,"This was a quick read. I read this book in 2 days. Although I enjoyed it and the other books from the Mama Lou series, I did not like the unbalanced relationship. The way he treated her on some occasions should have been deal-breakers. At one point he treated her like a prostitute. Also the confusion went on too long. Grown folk should have been able to figure things out sooner. Finally, for what he put her through, I think he should have had to work harder to get back in the good graces."
4,absolutely great,I picked up this book Friday night and did not put it down until Saturday afternoon. Lovely way to spend a rainy Saturday. I recommend it for busy moms looking for a rainy day escape. I cant wait until Ms Norfleet's next book. I came right to my computer to see who MommaLou was going to play matchmaker for next!
4,"A good, exciting read!!","Crescent Island is such a beautiful place, I almost believe that it exists!! The scenery in this book is excellent, and the characters are so well-developed that you'll want to keep turning the pages, just to find out what happens next! Madison Evans has been hurt in the past and she swears off men, that is, until she meets Tony Gates. Sparks fly when they Madison rents a cottage on his property on Crescent Island. However, their love must conquer several obstacles, including Laine, Tony's ex-fiancee. Tony has been hurt in the past too, and he's convinced that most women are gold-diggers, after his fortune. After they learn the truth about one another, they finally find the courage to trust and find happiness again."
5,Looks can be deceiving,"This book was wonderful, I read it in 2 days. Mama Lou has a good since of LOVE and places people together."
1,LOUD clicking and popping noises!,"This TV makes these horrible clicking and popping noises! It happens at least every few minutes, and they vary in how loud or hard it happens. It is so extremely annoying. The ""tech"" from the store told us that it was a known problem with the TV, that Samsung is aware of it, but it's not defective. Since it's been a couple of months, we can't return it. It's terrible when a company is aware of a problem, but refuses to acknowledge that it ABSOLUTELY IS a defect. They are doing nothing about it."
1,Bad Product,"I bought this Stupid TV at the end of 2007 and kept in storage for two years due to my presence in Iraq with US Army, and when we used it in June 2009 until present time, it required four repairs, which cost us more than a $1000.00. This is the worst TV we ever purchased. Very bad quality, and I swear to God if it fail again, I will throw it from the window. This is the wosrt product, do NOT buy this ever."
2,unreliable,"We have had this set for 18 months! Even with the help of TV savvy installers it was difficult to set up the unit for the correct type of picture quality we had. There were issues with the set just shutting off for no reason. The final was on 8/11/2009 it shut down and would not come back on with a picture or sound. 18 months is too short a time for a tv this costly to fail. Now we have to wait for 1 1/2 weeks for service. Hopefully we will not be told that it is unrepairable. The picture quality when it did work was average, even with HD. It showed so different in the showroom then in our home. I would not recommend this set."
4,Wonderful Picture,"The picture looks great, Planet Earth in 1080P is a sight everybody needs to see.The only problem I have is that the screen's weight will create a small bow effect. Straight lines on the screen have a slight curve, but it doesn't make the picture any worse and the bow is so slight that it isn't noticeable unless you are looking for it.This is a wonderful HDTV with a wonderful picture that I can't stop recommending to all my friends and family."
1,"Great Picture, But Major Flaws Including Terrible Bowing","I previously owned a 720p Sony TV and decided to upgrade....big mistake. I received this TV and have since returned it after a week. The picture is nice and pretty dang clear. The bad is that it bows. It is as if something was sitting on top of the TV pushing down to create a ""bowing"" effect. It is terrible when you watch movies with the wide-screen (i.e. black bars). Also, you can notice it greatly on the TV Guide channel and any other channel like ESPN or CNN with the ticker at the bottom of the screen.Another problem that I had is that even after adjusting the colors for some time, the reds bled a little bit and were just to bright.The good is that the TV is cheap (price) but also bad b/c it is cheap (cheap construction).I do not recommend this TV. I have since bought a SONY SXRD 55 inch for about $150 more, and it is great."
2,Great People - Not So Great Eulogies,"If you want to read eulogies about the rich and famous - here you go, and well done I suppose. I would have rated this book much more highly had the cover not included the phrase ""The Greatest Eulogies of Our Time."" They aren't. They aren't even close.If you want to read great eulogies, then look somewhere else. The best line in the entire book wasn't actually written by one of the book's eulogists. The eulogist merely quoted him:""His brother was worse.""And with that, readers seeking great or at least memorable eulogies can simply move on because they won't be found here."
2,"Unlike the others, I was very disappointed.","Though Billy Dead was one of the best works of fiction I have ever read, Reardon's sincerity is lost in her latest.She is trying altogether too hard.I found myself, sadly, desiring to skip entire paragraphs and when I did, I missed nothing. Then I did the unthinkable. About 80 pages in I skipped to the last two chapters just to get it over with.Much like overacting, she is over exerting herself as she tries to develop believable, empathy evoking characters.Had I never read Billy Dead, I would not read her again. But knowing the talent of which she is capable, I await her next work, with hopes that she relaxes and tells me a story that compels me to read every word."
4,Unusual and interesting,"The protaganist of this novel is not your typical contempory women's lit heroine. And that is wonderfully intriguing and entertaining. She drinks beer, loves her car, paints her own house, prefers her own company, and likes rough sex. But she's also very, very depressed. With good reasons, as we come to find out.The book is a rather dark read but compelling. It deals with an issue too much with us these days. And ultimately asks us to consider the damage of family secrets and lies. Not just to the family members but the community at large.I ran across this book by sheer chance and I'm glad I did. I found the cover design entirely misleading, however. It is much to feminized and wishy washy. Something this novel definitely is not."
4,Please do not be mistaken...,"I swear, the minute a band sees the the most modest of attention or airplay, they are automatically deemed ""sellouts"" by these so-called music gurus. Not all good music is underground. I mean Christ, this cd is great. ""The Best Deceptions"", ""Saints and Sailors"" and ""The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"" are amazing songs. The lyrics are written wonderfully and the fact that its all acoustic is really cool.The artsy-fartsy music critics only seem to like concept, or inacessable sounding cds (A lot of ""inacessable"" music is boring and trite).Call me a psuedo-indie fan, but I'll be that pseudo-indie fan with Lonesome Crowded West by Modest Mouse, Dairy by Sunny Day Real Estate, and The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most in my hand. (I'll also be enjoying myself, unlike many gurus who think the world is against them b/c they had a bad high school exp. Life is only as good as what you put into it)."
2,"Everything ""song"" sounds the same.","Granted there are some decent lyrics here, but D.C. does little to stray from its patented approach and one would be hard pressed to distinguish one song from another. Is this supposed to be the next big thing in music? Sorry, I don't buy it. It's wordy, but not very musical..."
4,Depressing Enough,"An album like this is a breath of fresh air. I've always been a fan of acoustic music, but it's so easy to screw it up. It takes a lot of guts for someone to sing a song with just a guitar backing them up. It's good to see an album like this come out now, when every band sounds just like the next one. The songs are well written, and sing-along worthy. I'm looking forward to listening to it until I'm sick of it, and buying their first album.The only real complaint is that the whole album isn't even half an hour long. Oh well."
2,I did not like this album,"I haven't heard much of Dashboard, so I don't know how ""The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"" measures up to their other stuff. I gave this album numerous chances and could not come even close to relating to the pain this guy is feeling. Here's why: He seems to be spending more time concentrating on how he can make his words fancy enough that he can't actually relate any beauty to me. His voice & its melodrama all strike me as being the tools of a stylistic artist, who while he does feel pain and sadness, is too busy trying to manipulate the listener into feeling it.That is my review - I know that others out there will disagree, but if you really want a taste of well executed lyrics & feeling I suggest artists such as: Palace, Fugazi, Pinback, Sunny Day Real Estate, etc. There's a night & day difference with the maturity you'll find in their work as opposed to Dashboard Confessional's."
1,Idealist lyrics captivate thousands w/ redundant romanticism,"I heard this album many times at my friend's house and while alone and I see the appeal of it, but I think many of its fans are being attracted by what sounds like an inviting song. I read some of the highly acclaimed lyrics and I found them to be redundant with obscure notions of love that any eleven year old girl could come up with.... On the plus side, they have ""touched"" many people with their quips about ""looking into your eyes and seeing the real you who is alone"" and other things like that. I think they could be much more creative. The music is just strumming guitar, with coherent lyrics can be good, but this has just become a couple guys with a guitar spouiting out ideas that make whiny teenagers feel better about themselves. This stuff is definitely not poetry, it's the national enquirer of the music business."
2,Falls Short,"I'm a huge emo fan but cannot stand Dashboard Confessional. Their songs are so slow, and their singers voice just isn't good. There is also hardly any guitar or drums in their music. Saves the Day and Taking Back Sunday are far better and not realy comparable. I don't understand why DC is so much more popular."
5,wow,well first off that girl who said his music needed work and it wasnt that great. well all i habe to say to u is that u must be so stupid that u cant see the wall in front of u the music is great and i bet u dont play an instrument so how can u tell some one they need better music when he does so much stuff. but as for the album its great he has better but its still great with vocals like that he can break through to any person with a life.
1,This Band is not that good.,I just recently saw Chris Carraba on CNN hawking his music in a acoustic format. I came to the conclusion that he is not a very good singer. He was yelling out the lyrics like an adolescent reaching pre-puberty. I am not buying into Dashboard Confessional as music to put in my library. I also sent a detailed e-mail to CNN to stop showcasing such horrible amateur music. I think that we all need our sanity.
1,"Hi, I'm Chris Carrabba.","Hi, I'm Chris Carrabba, and I can't sing. I just moan like a banshee about made-up things that sound so terrible that I act like happened to me. Goodbye now. And buy my albums! It's the only way to escape the torment of reality! I swear!"
1,...,"I bought this cd for one of my friends, and honestly it just isn't my style. If you like sappy love songs, about break ups, and you like whiney voices, then this is perfect for you."
1,How much music can you write about one breakup?,"Enough to fill an entire CD full of crap, as Dashboard Confessional shows. Chris' incessant whining and blubbering about breakups is enough to make even the seasoned veteran of music cringe in sheer horror... Instrumentation in most cases is nice. I will give this CD that. If they had released the CD without Chris whining, it would have been an okay album. Not Emo, Not Rock, Not Good. Plain and simple, you're better off just asking some Girl/Guy one the street to explain the worst breakup they ever had and try to sing it like a 5th grade remedial english class. That should give you some idea of how much Chris really sucks. If you insist on listening to his voice, pick up some Further Seems Forever and experience some music that's actually worth listening to, for all it's worth..."
1,horrible whiney empty and talentless,"I can't stand dashboard. Chris is horrible! This is a travesty of music. Every song is about the same thing. Some people say I don't like him because this is ""romantic"" music. I don't like it because it is complete crap. These songs are nothing and this band should not be recognized for anything."
1,PAIN!,"I heard that this was a great acoustic CD to listen to when you're depressed, so I bought it. After listening to the whole thing, only one word came to mind: ""ouch!"" I've never heard so much whining by someone about failed romance. Sure, I've heard breakup songs by the Deftones, Far, Will Haven, and even Sunny Day Real Estate, but all of those songs occupied ONE slot on the record. This is the same concept repeated in every song on the album with slight variations (eg ""I miss your bed,"" ""I heard about your trip and all the cute guys,"" ""You keep ignoring me""). For God's sake, Chris Cabbera, SHUT UP about your petty little breakup! There are more important issues in the world than you going unnoticed again!If you want to listen to good, emotional, acoustic rock, do not hesitate to buy either one of Neutral Milk Hotel's full-length albums. Or, better yet, check out Daisies of the Galaxy by the Eels. But whatever you do, stay FAR AWAY from this crud!"
2,*sigh*,"it really depresses me to continually read review after review of impressed, devoted listeners to chris carraba's particular brand of garbage. why? well, the picture it paints is just not flattering for my peers who cant get enough, and it would appear there are quite a few of you. its unfortunate that we cannot be considered part of the ""discerning listener"" segment of the population to any relative reliability. only a select few apparently grasp the reality here, which is that this is just standard pop with some decent guitar play (most of which can be replicated by your average guitar player) built around a sham, a charlatan who has seduced plenty with a single turn of phrase. there isnt anything behind it and just because hes reaching the upper limits of the human audible hearing levels doesnt mean we have to immediately assume its real. please dont allow yourself to be trapped by this incessant whining and move on to something decent."
1,This is ...[no good],Average Review:This is cool 'cause I read about it in ...[magazines] and they said it was cool and now I like it a lot even though it is pretty bland and isn't very interesting musically or lyrically.But Chris has some really cool tattoos!
1,0 Stars IF POSSIBLE,Lets all cry and break up with are girlfriend get a couple of tatoos just to look cool preffably stars with a whinny voice and BOOOOOOOM their you have it. A group of people who consider themselves punk. This is as close to a boy band like Backstreet boys as i have ever seen. HORRIBLE
2,Dashboards music is getting worse and worse,"Two stars may sound harsh, but this CD [is really bad].Dashboard Confessional's First album ""Swiss army romace""...rules and simply listening to it and going to the shows when he first started to tour, you could tell that he just loved to play. Now it is like this Rock star mentality, and he is putting [bad material] out their...buy the first ablum, this one is not great, buy you can buy because it is better than listening to dave matthews or creed, but if they ever come out with another LP, i would save my money."
1,I would give this zero if i could,"This truly wretched album epitomizes everything that is bad about emo. This band's singer must be close to thirty but he still writes sappy crybaby love songs like a middleschooler. I guess maybe I can understand how a 12 year old girl might like this in a sort of ""I wish i could have a boyfriend who is as sensitive as the guy from dashboard confessional and has hair as pretty as his too"" way, but other than that i just don't understand the appeal. I hear this band now has an unplugged special on mtv. Dear lord that must mean they are getting more popular. This has gone on for far too long. We must put an end to dashboard confessional once and for all!"
1,the record i have come to fear the most,"Whine, whine, whine. Girls don't like me. Moan, moan, moan. I get off on everyone's pity. Gripe, gripe, gripe. Buy my record so that girl who broke up with me six years ago will be jealous.Buy a Nick Drake or Elliott Smith record instead."
1,this is just horrible music,all i can say about this is that it is horrible music. people listen to it because it makes them feel deep but it doesnt. if you sing about how no one likes you and how much you love other people and throw in a bunch of useless metaphors it doesn't constitute to brilliant lyrics.
1,you have got to be kidding,"no way has music gotten this bad! screaming infidelities has got to be one of the worst songs ever!this band(if you call this ... a band) has no emotion nor diversity. you want emotion? listen to ""death blooms"" by mudvayne or ""fade to black"" ""welcome home(sanitarium)"" ""one"" and ""the unforgiven"" by metallica.thats emotion.this is overrated pop ... written to sweep 13 year old girls off their feet. and it looks as if its working.awwww,do you poor little preppies have it too tough? crying over some fight you had with your boyfriend?metalheads should be crying.our music is being dissed as"" talentless noise"" and other such insults.and metal is being replaced with ... like this. i dont listen to metal because i think the lead singer is a hottie, i listen to it because it has MEANING!which is something you all know nothing of.but oh well.metal is coming back soon and you'll be sorry you ever dissed it in the first place."
1,Pretty trashy,"If you enjoy hearing the f___ word, then okay. But if not,songs on this album should be banned."
4,Great to listen to,"The places you have come to fear the most is a great mix of punk rock love ballads and acoustic-driven mellow guitar riffs. This is a great CD to listen to in the background with some friends or while you're doing your homework.The only problem that I had with it is that (because of the all-acoustic format) the songs all start to mix together and sound the same after a while. Be that as it may, this CD is great for chilling and great for learning to play some of the songs. Buy it, listen to it, love it."
4,Ok LOOK...,"This is a solid album. Perhaps the type of music doesn't suit you, but nonetheless, it's a good one. Carrabba has a nice vocal range, and while his songs aren't the most revolutionary, they are honest and forthright, and obviously he has struck a chord deep within the psyche of many people. It's easy to hate him - he's talented, successful, good looking, and girls love him. Wait, lemme add, it's easy to hate him if you're insecure or jealous. Other than that, this is a good album to drive to or write to or clean to or just chill to. Good acoustic rock."
4,A Great Investment,"I greatly recomend this c.d. Although Chris' Lyrics at times seem very teenage like, isn't that what makes them great? Broken relationships! He does a wonderful job harmonizing with his acoustic talents and it's a shame whenever they add anything else to drown out the acoustic. I hope you enjoy this disc as much as I have. Oh...the great tracks are definitely ""Screaming Infidelities""(better on Swiss Army Romance), ""The Best Deceptions"", and also ""The Places You've Come to Fear the Most""."
5,definitely worth the time,"This is by far one of the best albums I've ever heard. Dashboard Confessional stays true to the following that it has accumulated, despite what some people consider a ""sell-out"" with Screaming Infidelities. Chris Carraba definitely has a handle on his music with lyrics from This Ruined Puzzle and Again I Go Unnoticed. And don't be fooled by the price;... That's not that bad for a cd. You owe it to yourself to give this cd a chance."
3,Strum and Whine,"You've heard of strum und drang? Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most is strum and whine. Chris Carraba's alternative combo feels fresh at first, a version of Guster with angst, but after the first three excellent songs, the CD disintegrates into bland uniformity. It's one long one-sided wallow in the aftermath of a bad relationship with Carraba cast as the permanent victim. It's understandable - he's very young - just don't expect any sympathy from me, buddy. You've covered that angle all by yourself."
4,Soft Happy Goodness,This CD is a really good CD for ANYONE!! Every song is a masterpiece. One of Dashboard Confessional's best CD's this album is so touching...every song comes from the heart. This is a great CD for the regular emo fan ut I would reccomend this album to just about anyone! It's not exactly party music...well it's not in the least...but it's a nice break from hardcore...this is a good CD for relaxing and cheering you up and getting over something....it's so many things...the perfect balance between agreeing with my depressed mood and enlightening me to make me feel happy! Just put this CD on and slip away from the world...if you like any kind of music at all I would definately suggest The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most. Enjoy!
1,Please... you've got to be kidding,"The only thing I can say about this is that people really need to reconsider this music. It is filled with sympathetic similies and emotional metaphors that really sum up to almost nothing at all. I can see how this would fascinate some of America's more romantic teenagers, but I believe that they fall in love with these songs because it sounds pretty, not because it is good music. Essentially, all these songs are people strumming some simple bar chords and singing in not-so-intelligent lyrics about their loves and how isolated they are.Too many people have been hypnotized by these songs because they make them feel that they are part of a deep and emotional experience. I would just reccomend to anyone who listens to this to reconsider what they're listening to."
3,A temper tantrum accompanied by accoustic guitar...,"So no Chris Carraba is not an incredibly talented guitar player. Nor is he an incredibly talented lyricist, despite a few clever turns of a phrase (i.e. ""lips that taste of other's kiss."") And, well, I can't say much for his singing ability either as much of this album seems to have been performed in a tone somewhere between screaming and desperate pleading.However, there is something endearing and very honest about this collection of songs about breakup and heartbreak. Listening to Carraba plow through this collection of ten songs reminds us of our vulnerabilities in love as well as how we tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously in youth.Perhaps like most cathartic efforts this album will sound like a work of genius to the artist and his fans just after the break-up, but after a few years and a little perspective they'll look back a little confused and perhaps a bit ashamed at all the melodrama."
1,a relationship nightmare...,"can you imagine being a girl and being in a relationship with this character? what a complainer. i can see one song about heartbreak, but every single one? come on, man. get a life, chris!i gave these guys some respect for a while cause i dug some of their songs and because DAN HOENER opted to join the dashboard over his former SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE pals. but i can't listen to anymore of this. it gives ""emo"" and it's fans a bad name. if you want to hear the real deal go check out AMERICAN FOOTBALL or PROMISE RING or THE NEW DEATH SHOW. i think you'll find what you we're looking for... music with heart and soul minus the whiny pretention. sorry."
1,Good Lord,Good Lord ya'll this album is truly ama...zingly horrible. Whoever said that he is a truly compassionate person is right because he seems to always want to cry his eyes out in every song just because he can't right one good decent tune. This is the kind of album that gives emo a bad name.
2,This is a bad band.,"This album is not good. The lyrics could have been written by a down syndrome baby. I mean, am I supposed to be impressed because this guy knows the word ""infidelity?"" I mean, that song is so bad. It sounds like they make up the timing every time they play it. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the bassist is cool."
2,More of a performance than music,"I really wanted to like this cd. For many reasons I won't go into here, I wanted to like Dashboard Confessional. Maybe I am too old, maybe too mellowed, who knows but I just can't enjoy this album. There is some interesting stuff, not the least of which are an intriquing vocal sound and some definite song-writing talent. BUT, it just plays unpleasantly, producing at times an irritating and displeasing sound.In the end I see the talent this guy has, but I don't enjoy it as produced here."
1,metalic insincerity,"I'm with G on this emo [junk] - you want metal and ""sincere"" lyrics, listen to Ruby Tuesday by the Stones or Little Wing by Hendrix - trite songs by rockers.Blues and folk music have emo for the deprived ; but I guess they don't have that distancing buzz of power chords played softly or big beats played softly - you emo folks need to listen to good old fashioned power ballads - that's the proper superficial nature of the music you claim is so ""real"" or ""heartfelt"""
1,God awful whining,I borrowed this CD from a friend that didn't like it. I thought I'd have a laugh at it as well. This CD is pure crap. It's so self-indulgent and whiny. You'd think Chris Carraba [singer writer band] would have been done milking a little junior break up for profits. I couldn't even listen to a whole song. He should just do the world a favor and kill himself. If he really feels that bad.
2,I'm scared when this gets to be so popular...,"This music sounds like it should be sung by some lovesick high schooler carrying a guitar around the school rather than a grown person. Even though it is musically and lyrically catchy, you can only have so much of acoustic emo, and this goes five times over that."
5,new to the genre and loving it,"I just started listening to emo punk a few weeks ago. A friend of mine got me into it. I got this cd and could not stop playing it for days. Chris' lyrics and voice are incredibly showcased on this accoustic set of songs. I nearly cry every time I listen to ""This Ruined Puzzle"". Everything about this album is brilliant."
4,Solid Album,"ID say this is definalty worht pick up if your into this style of emo singalong songs. I have pruchased the new album and it really can't comptere wiht carraba's old stuff. but if you wanna a real quality CD pick up ""The Moon Is Down"" by Further Seems forever, thats some quality carraba"
3,It depends,"Well all i have to say is this cd depends on your mood, if your in a meloow mood then this is a good cd to listen too. He is realy good at expressing his feelings, but if your not in a mellow mood than this cd is not one that i would listen too."
5,Signiture Dashboard.,"This is what made Dashboard unique. Acoustic, heart felt music, with emotionally driven lyrics. A 30 minute emotional roller coaster, and i dont think Dashboard could come up with something as good as this. From the amazing 'Brilliant Dance', to the up beat of 'Saint And Sailor', to the magestic 'Places You Have Come To Fear The Most'. This is defiently one of the best records, and its defiently one for anyone whos a sucker for anything acoustic."
5,Breathtaking,"After a recent break up with the first love of my love, i wasn't in the greatest of moods. I was looking for someone who understood, and i found that person in chris carraba. His breath-taking lyrics an powerful acoustic sound put it all in perspective. this guy is truly a lyrical and guitar artist. Thank you chris Carraba for putting it all ito perspective. This cd helped me get through the places i have come to fear the most."
4,Excellent...,"I bought this CD on the recommendation of a friend, and after giving it a listen, I hugged him the next time I saw him. I've never been into the ""emo"" scene, but Dashboard Confessional has something here for everyone. From ""This Brilliant Dance"" to ""This Bitter Pill"", Chris Carrabba makes you feel his pain about those darned girls and what they do to him. ""The Places..."" can be a little melodramatic and overly emotional at times, but those moments are few and far in-between. I'd recommend this CD to just about anyone, minus death metal fans, because it seems like practically everyone has experienced something Chris sings. I would give this CD five stars for content, but I have to give it four for length. Just about a half hour long, it seems quite short for a major label release. But oh well, it's a half hour of high quality music. Buy this CD and enjoy it for years."
5,Dasbhoard is good,"I've read so many bad reviews on this CD, but you have to understand that each song is different unlike what someone said, they sound different and the lyrics are completely different and unbelievably awesome in each song. If you do no like emo , you will not like this music."
3,I can understand why the teenieboppers love this but........,"Ok, I get it. Boy lives in suburbs, his girlfriend leaves him, he's upset, he cries.Don't get me wrong, Chris Carraba has a wonderful voice, and I beleive his lyrics are impressive, although terribly boring. What I have a problem with is the musicianship on this album. The backup band sounds decent, but people, the guy is an average guitar player. So, maybe im different, Im a musician, and play close attention to styles. But, I think the teenagers that are buying this CD in droves are more concerned about the ""he's so spiritual, he puts his heart on his sleeve"" lyrics. Yawn."
5,Dashboard Confessional,"This cd is an outstanding breakthrough in music. The music technique with the lyrics, intercept to make a awesome new sound. The words and phrases used our outstanding and can be listened by anyone. This is a great cd and everyone should try it out."
1,Zzzzz...,"When I first heard Dashboard Confessional, I thought I was hearing the Get-Up Kids, except they forgot to plug in their instruments. I have a friend who's a huge fan, who has force-fed me some of DC's music, and I've come to the conclusion that DC epitomizes the problem of most of today's music: it's just not fun to listen to. And what's worse about DC, is that this Carraba guy basically whines on and on about how sad and lonely he is. I need to find his address, so I can start billing him for therapy sessions every time I hear his music on the radio. If you want some good music, do yourself a favor: get off this website, get down to your local record store, and procure Ramones Mania, the antithesis of this boring, lifeless, and depressing release from Dashboard Confessional."
1,OMG!@ But he's sooooooo dreamy,"Ick...Dashboard is everything I hate about music, he sticks to an image, writes the same song over and over, and he whines like he's 7 and his mom won't get him that candy bar. Seriously you can buy much better emo cds than this, pick up some Onelinedrawing or some Sunny Day Real Estate or just skip to some real emo and pick up a few Fugazi albums. The sad thing is that I see Chris getting very popular in the near future...."
2,what happens when indie goes mainstream,"Well indie fans here's where it starts. Dashboard Confessional has started the push toward the mainstream for emo. This sounds like it was thrown together with the intent of just selling records. It just sounds bad. Dashboard Confessional has combined Goo Goo Dolls style pop and emo to make this unoriginal record. There is absolutely no sincerity in this record, the lyrics are lackluster and ambigous, and the vocals sound like recycled Saves the Day. If your interested in good emo try Cave In, Sunny Day Realestate, Jazz June, Dismemberment Plan, Lifetime, Fugazi, or Jawbox. Ignore this forgetable CD."
1,"whine, whine, whine","nothing but whining. sence hitting the mtv scene everyone seems to be loving this junk. sence most of these people haven't heard any other emo they think this album is amazing. it is not, unless you enjoy listening to the same man whine for an entire cd. granted chris is not all bad. lf you enjoy his voice i suggest his older band further seems forever. much, much better stuff. lastly how can the amazon.com review associate this junk with ben folds. that is an insult on ben folds music"
4,Good product.,Good deal and sure smell's great. I will recommend this product.Fast delivery. Surely worth the money. This was a special treat to myself.I smelled it on a customer of my.
1,Not a fan,The spice in this fragrance smells exactly like Indian food. I love Indian food but don't want to spray it on me. Happy I tried a sample vial before spending any more money.
3,Nice but not excellent,"This is a pleasant smelling fragrance but not for me. I purchased a few trial sized fragrances searching for something new. It is pleasant but has a very strong cinnamon scent that I just can't get passed. My wife liked it but did not love it either. It is nice but I will not be adding it to my collection. However, the musky overtone is very nice and is a mature taste. Try the trial size!"
3,"I like it, but don't love it","It just arrived to my office and I applied one spray. First impression is that it's spicy and reminds me of Christmas. One coworker said it smells like Old Spice. I primarily bought this based off the glowing reviews, but my first impressions aren't living up to the hype. I'll keep using it for a while and update if my opinion changes."
5,Cartier makes exquisite cologne.,"I absolutely love this scent, a little smokey and complex without being too pretentious. It's certainly my favorite of the declaration line. Wow, that sounds pretentious."
2,not what i expected,This was nothing I expected sorry I made the purchase. This was purchased on amazon and I will stay away from purchaseing items like this again.
2,I figured out a way to save as bitmap file,"I also was very disappointed in the fact that the invitations I spent a lot of time working on were not able to be saved as .jpg file, so I could print them off using a photo service rather than my printer. I did figure out a way to save the file as .bmp though. I went to my printer preferences and under ""finishing"" I checked the box to ""show print preview"". When the preview came up there was a save button I was able to click. This saved the file as a .bmp. I did test it and was able to email the invitation. When I opened the attached file the quality was not the best.HTH those who want to e-mail the invites."
1,If your buying because it is vista ready don't!!,I was told by the company to try this it would be similar to print shop for now until version 23 comes out. It is not at all like print shop!! If you are familiar with print shop and like it and want it to work with Vista I would save your money and wait for version 23 to be released!
4,Fine poetry,"Father John O Donohue is a fine, gifted poet. He is a much better poet than prose writer, in my opinion. So if a person does not enjoy his prose works, they may still enjoy his poetry a great deal. Although he is a priest, his poetry is not explicitly religious. Belief in the afterlife is a strong theme in the poems he writes about death. He gives us beautiful and thought-provoking images, which are simple and based on everyday experience. This makes them easy to visualize and contemplate. Aside from the odd spelling of *anam-cara* (sic) in the dedication, the little bit of Irish Gaelic in this book seems to be spared the problems with typographical errors found in his popular books *Anamchara* and *Eternal Echoes*. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy fine contemporary poetry."
3,"Ok, Not done reading it yet but.....","So far, this book is ok. Champion is Chestnut, Right? Not brown or a chocolate color. The Townsends should be sticking their noses in Champion's training and causing problems like they always do. If anyone has a way I could write Joanna Cambell E-mail Me please!"
3,Ok,"This book is not as well written as others in the past. What happened to Glory? He seems to have disapeared completly, which would seem unreal. This book does have its good parts though. My favortie books are numbers 1-4, with Wonder."
5,This is my second review,"Are all you people crazy! 20 was good! It wasn't the best, but it certainly wasn't horrible! I am wondering three things, where are the townsends? what happened to Glory? And in book 23 Ashleigh was pregnant, where's the kid? And to Mary-Kate also known as mroan@alltel.net with your ""Shut Up And Ride"", how many times have you lost a horse you dearly love. I've lost a horse more than a year ago and I still can't shut up and ride! Obviously you can't care too much about horses if you think that a horse you love more than anything is suddenly killed let's see how easy it is to get over that! I cried so much in book 19 and it's one of my favorites because every word that was said about how Cindy felt was true! Book 20 was great and so is Karen Bently!"
4,Highly Recommended as Additional Study Material,I always knew that there were other monarchies in the world besides the ones in Europe. The author goes in depth examining the systems of chiefs of the various islands and then the Royal Family of Hawaii. This is an important book for extra knowledge to be gained about the various systems of monarchy.
1,Cheap,"I never received my first order. I contacted the seller and he did send me another one right away. Disappointed in the product however as it's a cheap made in China bonded leather belt (doesn't look like the one pictured). The thin top layer of ""leather"" started pealing off after one wearing. I wore it once and it's now trash. You get what you pay for."
1,Piece of crap,"Though the seller is fast and reliable, I found the product to be a piece of junk in the long run. Started to fall apart after a few months. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Nice But,"The rack is nice but I would have preferred a depth equal to my cabinets. Also, the grate was bent when received and had to be straightened out."
3,Roll design not for me,"The product seems OK; maybe a little oversized. However, handling a roll shield is inconvenient. There are folding and twist designs I have previously owned and preferred.I returned it."
3,Rough Demo of a Potential Masterpiece,"If I described Liam Hayes' vocals on 'More Becomes You' as a sleepy, occasionally out-of-tune male Laura Nyro, could I also persuade you that this is a good thing?After the promise of the lushly orchestrated 'Found a Little Baby' single, this long-awaited album was initially a dissapointment due to its starkness, both in instrumentation - just piano and vocals with the occasional french horn & organ - and in Steve Albini's one-take production - which means Hayes doesn't always hit the notes.Soon though, these minor points become part of the album's beauty as your eyes slowly adjust to a run-out groove that's wider than the actual tracks (The record lasts under half an hour).The songs are melodic gems which take you to places you only previously reached with the help of Brian Wilson, Jimmy Webb and the aformentioned Nyro.Alan McGee once said he ""didn't understand the appeal"" of Plush. This was probably on the same week he signed Mishka."
4,soul clinic,if you like hank crawford this is one of his greatest cd's a must have for the serious collector.
2,Not yet the One,"Veitch's work is superb, second only to collaborator Alan Moore for originality and intelligence, but 'The One' is not the best example. It's a fun read, but I would recommend Abraxas, the Maximortal, or Bratpack ahead of this. Army@Love, which appeared c. 2007-9, is also extremely good."
5,a sweet find,"I picked this up as a cheap little cassette and it was a very pleasant surprise. Django is great, although not always front and center as I'd heard before. The rest of the players are excellent, but since I didn't get liner notes, not sure who they are. The horn solos/riffs in ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" alone are worth the price of the cd. Enjoy!"
5,Wrong category,"This is actually not a Gino Paoli cd, but a compilation of his love songs played on the saxophone by Johnny Sax and his group."
3,This book has been superseded by AC 00-45F,"This item has had a major update by the FAA, and has been republished by ASA (Aviation Supplies and Academics). Amazon does not yet carry it, although it's been available for several months. The current version, if you want it, is on the FAA web site and is labeled AC 00-45F. The update addresses many of the concerns I expressed in my review of the previous version (below).______________The old version, AC 00-45E, was very comprehensive but... This volume looks like the old software manuals that were written by programmers rather than by technical writers. Lots of detail but laid out poorly, and some of the explanations left me thinking, ""Huh?""Unlike Aviation Weather, which was obviously written by people who loved what they were doing, Aviation Weather Services looks like it was written by people who simply wanted to be done with it."
2,Interesting but music is better,"For the student, this book holds some insight into rasqueado though I found it lacked substance beyond ""here is what someone does"". I did not find its goals of sound and ease of motion to be substantial.Better to watch video in slow motion, find a good teacher and listen to lots of music.Good marketing idea. I bought it."
4,Frogs are people too!,"If you've ever wandered what those frogs,toads and other small creatures are realy up to. Its all explained in this cute story. Aboiut some pond creatures traveling from pond to pond under different stages of the moon to give concerts (croaking etc.in unison) and the many adventures along the way. I realy like how they use fireflies for flashlights and for putting on light shows at their concerts. also how they use their natural surroundings i.e. thorns used as swords etc. A great bedtime story read it to your kids they will love it and so will you"
5,Find Out How Vegas Became What it is Today-Read this Book!,"I recently visited Las Vegas for the first time and wasmesmerized by what I saw. Every casino appeared to have a story behindit, and upon my return home, I wanted to know those stories.The Players is a terrific read. The chapters give just ther right information on each topic to develop a working contextual knowledge of Vegas History. I was particularly fascinated by information on the Glitter Gulch rebels like Boyd and Binion. With the development of the Fremont Street experience, Downtown Vegas is a formidable tourist destination once again.Overall, a great book. Don't let the fact that is published by a university press scare you. The chapters are short and clearly written. The casino business jargon is kept to a minimum, or when it is used, it is explained well. This book deserves more of an audience."
3,Interesting stories. So-so writing.,"These are great tales of Las Vegas, but the writing drags. The research is clearly of the just-believe-what-someone-told-me school. There's still a great book to be written about the builders of the Strip and Glitter Gultch. This book is not the one."
3,A good place to start,"If you are looking for introductory information on some of the most famous Las Vegas personalities, this is a good place to start. Unfortunately, it is not a good place to find indepth information on these men and their connections. The title is also misleading as it suggests that these men are the pioneers who laid the foundation for Las Vegas but in reality what you have is a collection of white-washed bios of the most popular casino owners. The true pioneers are the the men and women who toiled in the sand before the glitz and glam era began. The collection of featured figures read like a who's who of popular Vegas lore but you'll very little that hasn't been documented before on each. Benny Binion, Kirk Krikorian, Jay Sarno, Bugsy Siegel, Mo Dalitz are just a few of the featured figures."
4,"Cheap Quality, Good Sound","I picked these up at a closeout store locally and half expected to end up throwing these away. For the price, I was willing to take a chance. I am glad I did. You can look at them an tell they are cheaply made. I haven't folded them up fearing they might break at the hinges but the audio quality is better than any non noise-canceling set I have owned."
2,Noise cancelling? Not quite.,"Granted these headphones are inexpensive, and not as uncomfortable as the price might lead you to expect. But noise-cancelling? Nope.The major difference that I could tell between the ON and OFF positions in the ANR switch is that in the ON position, it does a much better job of... picking up the funny electrical noises my iPhone produces when it is about to receive a call, or accessing the internet. I was not able to detect any noise reduction at all.Pros:1) cheap2) folding3) has airline adapter & carrying bagCons:1) not great sound2) the active noise cancellation doesn't work3) poor shielding of the ANR causes it to pick up electrical noiseIf you are looking for cheap, and relatively comfortable, go for it. But don't expect truly great sound or any ANR at all. Without the battery, it's a bit lighter, and actually works better."
5,RuroKen 17,"In Rurouni Kenshin Vol. 17 the Shishio Arc concludes. The final battle between Shishio Makato and Himura Kenshin is epic, and action packed thoughout. Each side seems victorius at different points and the reader encounters plot twist after plot twist. Watsuki ends the volume in a way that compleatly answers all questions the Shishio arc has left. I hope the final story arc (Jinchu(revenge)/Eneshi) is equally good."
4,Glen Campbell In concert,This a very good CD. The quality of the live recording could be better. The show is bit short.Glen sounds great!
2,Vendor disappoints,"Watch is fine, but vendor did not include the instruction manual or warranty papers with watch and very fancy box. Left them email message and they replied the papers were ""inadvertantly left out"" and promised to send the materials, but have seen nothing in the mail. They can correct this problem any time and I'll update this review."
2,Uncomfortable but beautiful watch,"Although this watch seems well made and is very attractive, I returned it to the vendor. The stiff plastic band was NOT comfortable and is a custom design which does NOT lend itself to being replaced with any other quality band (like leather). The watch DOES come alternatively with a stainless steel band, but the vendor did not offer this and the price is considerably higher when so equipped elsewhere.Also, the band was too long and there is no attractive solution to shortening it other than to lob the perfectly formed end off, rendering it with a ""hacked-up"" look."
5,Light hearted stories,"I gave this as a gift to a family trucker who likely can relate to some of the amusement. If it makes the day better for his experences, it is well worth the cheap price. Surprised it does not cost a little more."
5,CCD Imaging problem not present in this model,"Just an FYI for some of the previous reviewers: the problem of CCD failure that affected earlier versions of this Sony camcorder line is not an issue in the 2005 models. For complete information on the Sony CCD problem, see;http://www.imaging-resource.com/badccds.htmlFunctionally, this is a great camcorder for the price. The ergonomics are particularly nice - very comfortable and easy to use. Good low light performance. Just wish it had a colour viewfinder and that Sony had included a small Memory Stick."
3,Poor Video Quality - Great Audio - Very sleek design,"Pros- Very Sleek design - compact, stylish and menu through LCD touch panel- Good audio qualityCons- For the price, poor video resolution - video looks edgy when dowloaded via iLink- Not so good low light performance- No small size memory card provided, no firewire cable and no video editing software"
2,Playback feature doesn't hold up.,I have had two of these cameras. Both cameras broke down when it came to the playback feature. That feature is controlled by the touch-screen. Both cameras tough-screen features failed. I would not buy another one.
1,bad product,"This cam corder led screen did not show the colors and silver trim was off on switch, I reviewed this before. vendors need to display defects when advertising a product. I sent it back"
4,Great for point and shooters,The camera is great for point and shoot users. It is very easy to use (although the camcorder menu is a bit tricky) and has very decent images. The software provided is not great.
3,Okay for What It Is,I purchased the book based on a 5 star rating and review at the time and was disappointed. This is a picture book of Bardot from the ages of 30 to 40. There are approx. 55 pictures with a simple introduction.
2,Pleasant read but first half is very slow,"This author writes well but the first half is really slow. The good side of this is the character development but the bad side is that nothing happens and I think some readers will probably bail out before getting to the end. If you are not an ""action"" junky or expecting a horror novel, and you enjoy character related mystery novels with good portraits of local people, then you will like this one."
4,Genre enlivened by a great sense of place and character,"This novel is what genre fiction should offer -- a plot with all the color and energy its subject matter (werewolves) allows, but anchored by a detailed, realistic character and his friends and community. ""Moondog"" has one of the most viscerally appealing portraits one might find of working class northern Californians; it's a gritty character book and slice of Americana -- and a page-turner, too."
4,Jimmie Davis Gospel,This has good gospel songs on it if you're into gospel with country flavor. I purchased this as a gift for my parents.
4,Lady Bug Clips,They were cute but I thought they were plastic and I was surprised when they were wooden. They should match the decor good. Great transaction!
4,Punk n' Roll,"Los Angeles punk band Angel City Outcasts (not to be confused with the Angels from Angel City, Rock City Angels, or Lost City Angels) released their debut album Let It Ride in 2005. They've got a fun, very upbeat sound that's part Social Distortion, part Rancid, and maybe a shot of Avail-style melodic hardcore.Let It Ride is a totally enjoyable ""punk n' roll"" album, even if it's not the most original or creative thing going. You've got bouncy rhythms, catchy melodies and fun choruses to shout along to, which is sometimes all you really need. Besides, punk bands can so easily get too self-important and serious, so it's good to see a band like this that just gives you a good time. Bonus points for their punk spin on KISS's ""Detroit Rock City."" If you're into catchy, upbeat punk rock, Angel City Outcasts are well worth checking out."
5,"A gay mans paradise, but also caters to Breeders","I just finished this book yesturday and though that it was the most flabulous read i have had in ages. Don't think that the book just caters to the ""Gay"" perspective, its a fun hetero read as well. The comical Joel Perry humored me greatly throughout the book, with his funny anecdotes, petpeeves, and biographical stories. It's not only a great buy but a great read too. DOn't miss this book the next time you are browsing through the Gay and lesbian section. And if your hetero, try taking a look you might find something that aspires to you. Enjoy!"
3,HAYWARD-Welcoming Garden,"This is a decent edition, though I can't say it improves on Hayward's Your House, Your Garden or others in the field. The quality of the illustrations really varies, and some locations are redundant to YHYG. I was looking for advice about replacing my front lawn and wish I'd found more here. My top picks for garden design remain Natural Gardening in Small Spaces, by Noel Kingsbury; Front Yard Gardens, by Liz Primeau; and the Piet Oudolf books."
2,All over the place,"I started watching reruns of the Gong Show with my boyfriend, who told me Chuck Barris said he worked for the CIA. After seeing him on his show and hearing about the premise for the movie I thought it would be really interesting. It wasn't. It was just boring and all over the place. Sam Rockwell did really well for what it was."
2,"must move faster, because you can go to sleep!!!","story line was boring. started to move after one hour, but the last half hour moved the best... it is not the kind of movie I would say to someone to go and see. Julia Roberts part was a change for her, but not bad. if this is true about Chuck Berris then I know why his programs were so good when I watched them on TV back in the 70's. DO'NT RUSH TO SEE IT..."
2,attended the premier from the Plaza in NYC...woohoo,"and there the excitement ends...Drew is sooooo beautiful in person vs her screen image and of course the Clooney magic is never ending, cept for this borefest...geez louise, maybe I can blame the editor and GC had tons of useful celluloid and was too busy courting some hot cupcake to oversee the final product, I REALLY wanted to see him excel given his fine performances on the other side, I rermember the banal existence portrayed with Barris's original fructose fodder and learned at an early age to eschew the small screen, curious who wrote the fav reviews, Fincher...Soderbergh...Stone...Griffiths???? guess if I wanna watch discombulated unrealistic lotsa loose ends fare I will enjoy Memento, a high class roller coaster ride... but thx GC for trying, what's next, don't tell me!"
1,You know...,"...I really don't think that this movie had enough montages.And have you ever noticed how people who really like stuff like this and think they're all smart for ""getting it"" can never seem to spell the word ""definitely"" correctly? Huh.This movie sucks."
2,about this movie...confessions of a dangerous mind,I find that the movie is not interesting at all and the last part of the movie shows that he is hosting a entertainment/variety show. The opening shot of the movie in both the sex scene are fast paced and one of the scene was quite funny.
2,Another movie based on a book.,"The book makes for good reading. From the previews that i've seen of the movie,,,,well that's another story. Personally i believe that Kermit the frog would be a better choice for lead role."
2,This movie should get the gong,"This adaptation of an ""unauthorized biography"" of the man who single-handedly numbed more brains in the 1970s than anyone else is barely worth the time to watch it. The only positive thing I can say is that is (if you're a child of the early 60's and 70's) it brings back memories (The Unknown Comic? Gene, Gene the Dancing Machine?)."
3,Watch the movie before reading the book!,"The movie itself is well-acted & fun to watch, but if you've read the book you feel like they left out/changed the most engaging plot points.Sam Rockwell does a great job as Chuck Barris and Drew Barrymore is a sweet, pathetic Penny Pachino which makes the love story of the film work on a basic level. Unfortunately the espionage elements which made up the majority of the book are glossed over in favor of artistic fluff.Barris' friendship with Jim Byrd is cut away to merely boss and employee, while Patricia's eventual fate is meaningless b/c she is shown as a brief sexual fling with no susbtance. It's too bad they wasted Julia Roberts in this part, that was the best part of the book.I would suggest reading the book over viewing the film, but it still has its entertaining moments."
5,Underappreciated movie,"Everyone knows Charlie Kaufman for ""Being John Malkovich."" While that movie was great, this movie is right up there with it. The cast is wonderful, and the plot is so intriguing. It makes you almost believe something that is completely unbelievable, and for that, it is nothing short of brilliant. Sam Rockwell needs more starring roles; he is a great actor."
4,Bizarre biography,"Sam Rockwell is amazingly authentic in his portrayal of Gong Show guru, TV game show producer and purported CIA assassin Chuck Barris. George Clooney does a commendable directing job in recreating Barris' theater of the absurd lifestyle. He also plays a buttoned down and cryptic CIA recruiter who ushers Rockwell through his secret life as a spy.Drew Barrymore is effective in playing Barris' significant other and eventual wife Penny. Although very flaky she provides Barris with a beacon of normalcy in his tumultous and philandering existence. Julia Roberts has a minor role playing Rockwell's espionage contact and occasional love interest.The movie studded with quotes from actual players in Barris life such as Gong Show regulars Jaye P. Morgan, Gene Gene ""The Dancing Machine"" and the Unknown Comic. The flick disturbingly concludes with a somber diatribe from Barris himself that reveals the unfulfillment Barris' life had become."
4,A well titled film,"This is a film that takes a step forward at an intersection in filmmaking. It examines and exploits an individual characters mind to its extremes. Similar to the far reaches of Fight Club and Vanilla Sky, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind shows the true potential of human creativity and imagination. However this film has one thing I had not yet seen; this film is real, about a person whose perspective is not just imagined. Bravo George Clooney; I have gained respect. Well worth your purchase. Four stars."
5,Very entertaining,"How much of this movie is true is debatable, but it doesn't really matter because it moves at a fast clip and keeps your interest the entire time. This movie really brought Sam Rockwell to my attention as an actor who can carry and entire movie on his shoulders.If you like 70's nostalgia, tv game shows, clock and dagger spies, lots of movie stars and good acting, you'll probably enjoy this movie."
2,sam rockwell,i give this two stars for sam rockwell's genius performance. not much to this pathetic movie.
1,BIZARRO BIO,"The conceit of CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND (Miramax) is that Gong Show host Chuck Barris was also a CIA assassin.George Clooney directs this bizarro bio with a heavy hand; there are no nuances except for the uncanny Sam Rockwell as Barris.Clooney's commentary, filled with allusions to classic films, is much funnier than he intends."
1,Junk,"I agree with inframan'a review. If the option had been available I would rate it 0.It is disjointed, hard to follow, and I can't see such a loser becoming an assassin.The better scenes seem to have been stolen from other successful movies such as ""The Eiger Sanction"" and ""Monsieur Verdoux"".It's slapstick nonsense that's poorly done."
1,Did not like it..,"Could not make heads or tails about this movie. I know others loved it, but this is not for me."
4,STRANGE BUT VERY FUNNY...,A very off beat but WAY FUNNY film... Certainly worth checking out... Note especially the cameos by Bratt Pitt and Matt Damon as 'Dating Game' contestants that DON'T GET PICKED - they lose to a FAT GUY...
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #001,"Best:1) Sam Rockwell's impersonation was spot-on.2) The script was goofy and lighthearted.3) It had a fairly authentic 1970's feel.4) We get to see some of the actual ""Gong Show"" people again5) We get to hear Chuck Barris himself talk about things.6) There are lots of special features including commentary.Worst:1) It should have been funnier.2) There are no final answers about Chuck being former CIA.3) There were no Drew Barrymore nude scenes (ha).Recommendation:Don't spend $20 on this one. Wait until you can get it for $10 or less, then jump on it."
1,Awful in Every Way,"Only the second movie in my life that I walked out of for fear of dying a horribly painful death from bad movie contamination. The story is uninteresting, the acting is unimpressive and looking at Sam Rockwell's butt gets dull after the first 10 seconds."
2,Very Ordinary,"George Clooney continues his run of outs with this effort following on from the dismal Solaris. This time although the movie is less of a dud, he (as director) must take more of the blame. On the surface of it, this movie has all the makings of success combining good actors, an intriguing story and plenty of adult concepts. I was really looking forward to this telling of the quirky life (real or imagined) of Chuck Barris. Despite the promise, this movie simply does not engage. There is no real excitement at any point and you simply cannot relate or empathise with the main character. Others will disagree, but for me this movie just meanders along. Delving a bit deeper, the soundtrack is completely poor also, and this does not help to add any vigour to the wishy-washy plot. Overall, the movie is not a complete waste of time, but you have to feel disappointed knowing what could have been achieved with this raw material."
3,Great performance by lead: hard to take story seriously,"Who's kidding who. Mr. Barris did not kill 33 people. He did not get swapped at Checkpoint Charlie, and he did not outsmart treacherous agents around the world. Asking us to believe that he did (or might have) is taxing to downright annoying.But who cares. This movie has a lot going for it. The lead is amazing, Drew Barrymore hits just the right tone, and Clooney's directorial debut is truly impressive. A very worthy rental, but by no means is it a comedy. Consider it a quirky drama, and watch it for the style of the shots and for the very impressive lead performance."
2,I confess its out of my mind!!,"Just want to forget I seen this movie I watch until the end waiting for something to get good, but nothing and I like my true stories ,but not this one .Maybe not in my time chuck Barris a story but not a movie nice try for two stars."
2,"When I see ""Cameo"" appearances in an indication...","Don't believe this movie to be factual, as it has never been documented that this was no more than ""a way to sell the book itself."" Clooney fans will go with great expectations to stare at the SuperStar..however, this movie doesn't deliver. Catch Me If You Can is a much better way to spend an evening out. Wait for Dangerous Mind to come to HBO.Just my opinion."
1,can't believe the positive reviews,"I just got through watching ""confessions of a dangerous mind""so thought i would check here to see comments about the movie and the CIA red herring. I couldn't believe anyone would give this movie even a single star except you have to to post a review. I would rather watch reruns of the shows Chuck Barris created, or listen to Palisades Park. I will probably buy the book to see if it is any better than the movie, I sure hope so. Truth or fiction, this movie was not entertaining or ground breaking in any way. The only thing that kept me interested at all, was looking for cameo appearances. I guess it is best summed up by the final shot of Chuck Barris, which was incredibly sad, but not as sad as the fact this movie was ever made."
2,Cheap quality,Cheap quality AND they shrunk to small size after wash & dryer.Look around for better.
1,Let's be lighting FAST: don't buy this book; don't wastet your time,"Let me say what I have to say in a lighting FAST way (that I did not learn by reading this book): it is tedium itself; repetitive, uninspired, tiresome. As if this was not enough, it has plenty of nauseating humbug supposed to motivate you.Keep away from this book. I am sure you have better things to buy with your money; better things to do with your time; better things to feed your brain with.(By the way: I gave it one star because Amazon does not allow me to give it zero or less.)"
2,Not for everyone,This book really did not help me at all. In my opinion there is too much explanation of what should be a simpler task. I can create an outline a lot quicker than what this book states and without the headache. Maybe I am dense but the way the author explains here is much to complicated for me to grasp.
5,"Breezy in important spots, but excellent overall","I particularly liked how he prioritizes the editing process: Refocus (go back and do it over), Research (need more details), Edit (good, but needs rewording), Tweak (put some zing into it). You categorize each of your smallest sections (chapters, scenes, or paragraphs, etc.) Then re-write all the Refocus ones before moving on to the next priority, Research, etc.I also liked his idea of keeping a ""bin"" for scraps of material you edited out of your draft.The discussion on the preparation and writing phase could only be described as a 30,000 feet view. But that may be a moot point because each type of writing has different requirements. The author succeeds in giving the reader an overall view of the process. His tone is motivational (heavy copywriter; but wait, there's more) and I think that helped because most writers need a kick-start."
4,Reads FAST,"I caught myself a bit of writers block recently, and needed to get back into the game. After some searching, I came upon Jeff Bollow's book ""Writing FAST"" and bought it at face value. And I have to say I'm glad I did. I read it in two days and the approach which he dubs FAST, is easily understood and the whole book is kept in an easily understood language.That being said, though it is a quick and motivational read, you have to get past the sometimes almost maniacally phrased chapters, as Jeff almost trips himself over in exhileration with the technique.A bit too overenthuatic perhaps, but still a good read. Recommended."
1,Not helpful for me,"I found nothing useful in this book. I kept reading, waiting for some nugget of useful information that never came. There are a lot of words here, but nothing useful. I mean, the first three chapters are just fluff. The fourth chapter is titled, 'capture your idea' and includes phrases like 'ideas are incredibly slippery little beasts' and 'use your fear to find it'. Seriously, it's like you're listening to a motivational tape rather than learning about a 'system'. Sorry. I wanted to like this book, but I can't recommend it. Save your money."
1,wrong measurement,"This stone is NOT 12 1/2"". It is 12 & 7/8"". If it were the right size as it stated, it would have fit in my toaster oven. I don't know why the box it came in gives the wrong size. The other reviewers were wrong too. If you need the exact size, this is not the one to buy. Sears sells a 12"" pizza stone on their web site."
2,Not the right size,"I purchased this pizza stone to fit into a toaster oven which could accommodate a 12.5 inch stone at the largest, but this stone was just over 12.75, so no dice."
1,Cracked on second use,We placed the stone on the lowest rack of the oven and set the heat to 500*F. A pizza stone has one failure mode and that is cracking in heat. The first crack we decided to ignore since it was just a corner and we could still use it. The second crack split the thing in half. It is a waste now on its second (and non-consecutive) night of use. Could not recommend.
4,First pizza stone--good so far,"I bought this pizza stone for my wife for Christmas. So far I'm pleased. It really helps make the crust of your pizza come out nice and crispy and cooked evenly all over. We've used it probably 6 times so far.The manual says you should not clean it with soap, you just have to scrape off anything stuck to it, and you can rinse it off with water when the stone is cool. This seems weird to me, not sure if all pizza stones are like that.As a bonus, the pizza cutter that comes with the stone is actually good quality, not flimsy like the old one I had."
3,A tough fighter trapped in a cartoony world.,"Predator looks out of place in this game. The Predator himself looks great & has a huge amount abilites & weapons & different sight visions. The way the Predator jumps up to buildings & has some realy nice weapons to use & alot of different combos. While the Predator looks realy good & detailed ,the people on the street look cartoonish & a little like people in the first spiderman game. And the missions are ok but theyre kinda on the kiddie side. It just felt like the Predator belongs in a cooler darker and more detailed enviroment & sharper detailed enemies. The Predator does have some great moves and alot of good weapons but he's just out of place in this game.The Predator himself deserves about 4.2 stars but the buildings and textures and the goofy looking people seem like there better suited for a kiddie game. 3 stars for the whole package."
5,Estwing Hammers,These hammers are really great tools to use as there is no handle to come loose or wobble . Also the cushioned handle asorbs the shock for driving in pins or riveting or any task requiring a lot of hammering usage.
1,Heaven Save us from such vocal horror,"This performance is frightening, both from the standpoint that 1.) anyone thought this performance was worth recording and 2.) that such a recording would ever be made of such a performer. I am baffled. I apologize if my tone is harsh, but really........what can one except after being inflicted with such music making? There is no style, no vocal enjoyment, and no interpretive expression. Perhaps this recording, and another by the same performer, are vanity recordings. I give one star because no matter how negative this commentary/review is, I give the performer a nod to the fact the she had the ""guts"" to make a recording."
3,"The music is defiant of the status quo, the bomb, but...","Dalvin of Jodeci really put his head out there when he did this song, in fact, when he really decided to go solo. I think he was always a solo artist (like Left Eye of TLC), but I didn't think he was going to sing, especially lead. Although he's not a lead vocalist on the level of KCi or SisQo, but he's cool. I think people are going to trip once they hear this song and see the video, but I'm not going to say anything until I hear his album. I don't think he's a strong lead vocalist (thus far, and according to this song), but he, Stevie J, and his brother, the best producer of all time and multi-instrumentalist, DeVante Swing are by far the best producers and musicians in the history of soulful R&B ever. Dalvin is an incredible drummer and you'll see when you check out some vintage Jodeci concert footage, Dalvin's video for ""Why Can't We,"" and maybe his album. I can't wait to hear his album!"
5,Endurance Double Wire Tongs,"I bought these tongs at a store 4 or 5 years ago. They are wonderful! I use them for grilling, tossing salads, whisking, in the fry pan and more. I have been wanting another one for me and others for gifts. Mine is in the dishwasher 3/4 of the time or more. I just received one and will order more. These are sturdy tongs, not like flimsy ones that have been advertised on TV. I had a couple of those TV tongs that my dad gave me, and threw them away. These Endurance tongs have easily carried large steaks without a problem. Also you can pick up food like baked potatoes or corn on the grill without any problems too. This is probably one of the ten things in my kitchen that I can't do without."
4,Good memory card for the price!,Memory card works perfectly. My computer runs faster now. I have no problems with this working properly. Thanks!
3,Memory review short,Affordable Memory. Memory is always a good thing.Pro: affordableCon: depends on vendor
5,Kalgoorlie love songs by Kevin Bloody Wilson,"This album is not for the faint of heart. It contains course language, but is extremly hilarious! Tracks 2 & 5 are my favorites with his BOLD and positive humor. ""IT WAS OVER"" ( track 7 ) reflects a character down on his luck while trying to get lucky with a ""Sheila""(woman).The characters problem is his inability to get into the ""Sheila's"" undies without blowing his load in his own undies. After listening to this album you should have learned some new Aussie slang and quite possibly be able to understand the opposite sex a little better!!!!!!!!!(from a back country, hill billy, redneck perspective.) BUY IT. BUY IT. BUY IT. TRUST ME,BUY IT."
5,As Represented,This was a used book--just as represetned. It was received in a timely manner. I appreciate good used textbooks to help save money while still getting all of the information provided in a new textbook.
3,Careers Serving Families and Consumers (4th Edition),"The chapters at the end of this book were totally messed up! It went from Chapter 17 back to 14 which really wasn't the first chapter 14, and had a little of chapter 20."
2,Careers Serving Families and Consumers (4th Edition),"As a required text for a college-level class, the tone of this book is better suited to high school level. The content is redundant and somewhat outdated."
3,Disappointing,"I was thrilled to learn of a cookbook which put an updated spin on Jewish cooking. Reading the 5 star reviews added to my anticipation in receiving the book. Unfortunately, the book doesn't live up to my expectations. While the book includes some interesting dishes, the recipes are time consuming and include hard-to-find ingredients. I am a working mother of two and do not have unlimited amount of time to cook.Check out Marlene Sorosky's books. While the dishes are not as exotic, there are plenty of recipes with interesting spin that are not as time consuming. She even includes ideas for make ahead planning and shortcuts."
4,From the list of a cookbook junkie!,"Since I've gotten the Create channel, all kinds of cooking shows I'd never heard of pop up, and Jeff Nathan's was one of them. He hangs out in the galley with some pals, cooking and swapping stories (they're all NUTZ!) having so much fun, I'd like to hang out with them in the galley myself. Naturally, a couple of recipes interested me, so I went looking to see if he had a cookbook--found it thru interlibrary loan, and then just had to have it in my collection. Some Jewish dishes are classics for me (latkes, brisket, etc) but this guy does out of the box kinda cooking--crazy stuff with matzo, like chocolate bark and lasagna--crazy, I tell ya! It's a fun and interesting book to read, just for the fun of reading (as many cookbooks that I buy are), and the recipes are an added bonus."
1,Never again,Product arrived damaged. Re-shipped and never received that shipment-broken in transit so was returned to supplier before it arrived. I can only assume that this supplier is not aware of proper packaging of fragile items. What was not broken was pretty cool though.
2,Old fashined feel,"All in all this movie was not really funny except when there was a mix up with the mail order bride. The rest of it was not so interesting or funny. There was something missing from either the acting or the script, but I am not sure what."
3,Grandad's dream come true.,The first third of this film is hilarious. I just love the way the three old timer sea farers reach the conclusion that one of them has to marry in order that they have a housekeeper to share. The best is the hunt for a bride through the lonely hearts column. The lines are perfectly delivered - the facial expressions a scream to watch as the plan is hatched and an ad placed. But after the mail order bride arrives the movie becomes predictable. It is all grandad's fantasy as young women apparantly fall for 2 old men who look like they won't make their next birthday. Just 3 stars - but worth watching for the very funny first third of the film.
4,Solid portable hoop,"I was very happy with the fact that the shipment was scheduled several days after Christmas and it arrived over a week early. Box was a bit beat up but everything was there except for two washers I happened to already have a supply of. Probably took 5 hours to set up... and you need a second adult for about half of that. Having saw horses or other items to brace the hoop when you install the parts around the backboard was a huge help. Also recommend having deep sockets for some of the nuts (1/2"" I believe). Besides some of the nuts that were hard to reach, the height adjust shock was probably the trickiest part to assemble.Pros: Adjusts smoothly and easily in infinite increments, sturdy for a portable, rim and backboard are solid, looks good, backboard is decent size, set up seems stable with water in base.Cons: Does not roll very easily on wheels (too recessed), especially over uneven ground or up/down slopes."
2,Frustrating assembly experience,"The basketball hoop is promoted as manufactured in the US. Actually most of the hardware is made in China. Two bolts came with a thread that was not long enough and I had to call to get replacement parts. After I received the parts I continued to assemble the hoop and discovered then that two washers were missing to complete the assembly. As I was fed up with waiting, I went to Home Depot to buy the washers. After a week of asembly (and my children waiting to play), I have a sturdy, nice looking hoop but the assembly experience was frustrating. I think that Lifetime should do more quality control."
2,"Dry, but good","Cookies are a bit dry, if not eaten right away, they are pretty hard. Nice selection of gluten-free flavors, though"
5,"Awesome, addictive cookies","Sun Flour's cookies are AMAZING. They're rich and textured and delicious. I can't possibly recommend them enough, unless you're trying to diet or something. Good luck not eating the entire basket in a day."
4,Good read,"This is the 3rd book about McClairen's Isle. Was happy to finally read about the sister of Ash and Raine. Well put together book. I enjoyed the main characters and their dialogue between one another. Still feel like ""The Reckless One"" is the best out of the 3 but the other 2 are good also. All 3 books are enjoyable reads."
2,Total Training For Microsoft Web by Janine Warner,Buy this product only if you are already proficient with Front Page. This is not a program for the Web beginner.
1,Looking for a wedding music... don't stop here,"With so many good bands out there ... - why would anyone want this antiquated CD. Sounds more like a funeral dirge then a simcha (happy ocassion). And definitely agree with the previous review - Wagner doesn't belong on anything Jewish. If you're looking for music for an upcoming wedding - try Neginah or Neshoma Orchestras, Piamenta (if you appreciate an awesome musician), Oif Simchas if you like techno rock, Chevra if you like ""boy group"" ala N'Sync. All can be found online."
2,Not one of the better compilations,"Claudio Simonetti, previously member of the Italian band of the 70's ""Goblins"", has seen his works grouped in several compilations, of which, unfortunately, this is not one of the best. The songs are: Profondo rosso (deep red), Phenomena, Opera, Demoni (demons), Elucubrations, Suspiria, Tenebrae, Ozone free, Craws, Profondo rosso live.Craws is the only track that can't be found elsewhere, and it is a pretty nice piece with a hectic beat. In other versions, as in the album ""X-terror files"", tracks such as ""profondo rosso"", ""phenomena"", ""suspiria"", ""demoni"" and ""tenebrae"" are great, here they are rather plain. Simonetti's other albums are worth a little search effort, I would pass on this one."
4,Interesting Fast Read,"I'm not totally familiar with the stories here so I cannot say how accurate it is. One can easily read it in one evening, wish there were more but I guess there are only so many ""hexed"" movies! The connection of Manson to one film was eerie. I'm not sure if The Misfits was cursed, it just had bad things going on off-camera. An old actor, a writer having marriage trouble, and an actress who had a pill problem. The most interesting though was the story about Genghis Khan and all the actors who died of cancer after filming near a nuclear bomb testing area. Radioactive soil shipped to Hollywood?! Scary stuff."
2,don;t know how to evulate this item,"use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~!"
2,Lots of button and whistles,Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it.
4,Full of Life and Imagination,"This book is a must for all Lucy Maud Montgomery fans...or anyone who enjoys a good read. Anne Shirley is full of life and imagination, making every page more exciting and enjoyable than the last. Anne's adventures through school and finding a family keep the reader interested with every page turn. It is a wonderful story and should be read by all."
5,Normal telephone number rings a normal phone.,I have one of these operating on my home network and it allows a dialup phone number to ring a standard phone that you plug in. Both inbound and outbound calls work well. You do need to be able to forward a couple of ports from your internet visible IP with a normal SOHO style router. I happen to use i-connect as the service that provides my phone number but many others also support this device. You will need instructions from your service provider on how to configure the device. There is also a later version from Cisco which also has a switch built in. This would allow you to operate both a computer and telephone from a desk or hotel room with only a single ethernet connection. The sound quality is similar to compressed voice circuits. i.e. usable for business but not the clearest line you ever had.
5,Insightful essays,"In his introduction to this fine collection of essays, addresses, and lectures, Rene Girard asserts that the social sciences are ""impotent"" and that they need ""the great literary masterpieces to evolve."" He argues the point with great clarity and persuasiveness in pieces that deal with, among other topics, the rivalry among great intellectual figures such as Nietzsche and Wagner, the ability of Dostoevsky's novels to surpass Freud in understanding mimetic desire, and the ability of the mimetic hypothesis to elucidate myth. Girard's analysis of a late work by Albert Camus, La chute, involves a revealing look at its more famous predecessor, The Stranger. This volume concludes with a wide-ranging interview that enables Girard to define his relationship to such thinkers as Jacques Derrida and Kenneth Burke. A powerful and insightful book."
2,"Interesting on the outside, bad story on the inside","Okay... maybe my rating was a little harsh but like I said not one of the best stories(in my opinion). The cover and the summery are both very well done. The story however started excellent, but the plot started lacking the special punch of a good book. The saying ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" is very true in both bad and good ways."
3,A must have for the christmas holidays,"If you own a piano, and love christmas then you won't want to miss this deal. The book had all of my favorite christmas songs, and the price couldn't be beat. Throw it in with the rest of your order."
4,Good book but there is lots of errors,"I had to use this book for my anatomy class. And starting at chapter one practice test there are errors that the editor over looked. Chapter 22 is the worst, with one of the practice test answers saying that PMS is undescended testies. Now you dont need to take a class in anatomy to know women dont have testies lolI contacted the publisher and informed them about the errors. But other then the practice tests being all screwed up it is a pretty decent book. It really helped me and I liked the way the book taught me. i ended up getting the highest grade in class by reading the book, going through the chapter vocabulary and testing my self in the practice tests... I also used the study guide :)"
3,Everything except the cd,"Everything thins was great with this book, other than it didn't include a cd in the cd packet attached inside"
5,Textbook,This book came in perfect condition. It was the best price I could find anywhere and came with a hard cover. A soft cover version of this book was 70$ at my school book store. Thank you!
3,NO EVOLVE CODE,Nice hard cover book. Not the the paper back that they sell at the college. The only bad thing about buying this book is that it does not come with the access code for evolve.
2,Another school book,"The picture it portrayed on Amazon didn't arrive in the mail. This was a way older version of what I had wanted. Other than that, the book arrived in good shape and I was please with the amount of time it took for me to get it."
1,Never recieved my book!,I am very disatisfied. THe amount was taken from my account but I never recieved my book!
1,Wouldn't do THAT again!,"From the day i installed it on my iMac and (and then on my MacBook) it gave me more error messages than anyone could expect. i kept being told to reinstall the program. i did and it still came up with the same error messages and the same reinstall message. It is much more trouble than it is worth and i would never buy the product again. If you have it and want to get rid of it, you can not trash it like any other Mac application. You must put the original disk in and use the uninstall program. Otherwise you will never be rid of the nuisance."
1,Beware: it may not be compatible,"I purchased this item to use with a Yamaha QY100. The device was not able to format or read the card. I was able to format and erase the card in my card reader, so it is not defective in that sense, however I cannot use it.Update January 2013: Bought a new card, sealed in the original package, on ebay. This card worked perfectly. I think the generic cards sold on amazon are sub-standard or defective."
2,"like the movie blah,blah,blah","this was the first spidy book i ever bought.i thought i'd check it out because of the movie and because i am a mcfarlane fan.at least he didn't let me down,the art was fantastic!i loved the way he drew marry jane,a gorgious comic babe.the rest of the book was like the movie,to much talk and not enough action.at least the movie had a great villian,something this book missed.i dont even know how to give a discription of the story because it was jumping around all the time and had no real plot.i realy am not a marvel fan.i think they have good heros,just bad storys.i'd stay away from this one,unless you want to get it used and check out the art,which is far better than the story.that is why i give it 2 stars instead of one."
2,Champion- winner or loser,"I like Champion. but on page 166 it says pride lost the Preakness in the mud but actually Pride one that race, he lost the Belmont on a dry track to a fresh horse and under all kinds of pressures. I'm sorry but you don't see Champion under so much pressure. Also in this book Samantha's hardly ever mentioned, and she was my favorite charecter. Still this book is better htan the other books in the series.I hope that Joanna starts to write these books again. I'm still a faithful fan and I will continue reading the series. But plese bring Sammy back from Ireland, and please write a superedition about the lost years, that occur in book 24."
2,They Just Aren'tWritten good anymore,This seris is not going to last much longer. Karen Bentley has taken all of the good story lines out of it and made it like the perfect little life. I remeber that a couple of the books were so good that I would just cry but now nothing goes wrong everything is always perfect. The Townsends are gone and the good characters have less and less of a part. I think the only way to save the seris is to have Mrs. Campbell start writing again and then a Special Edition needs to be written to get everything on the right track.
3,Good Book,"I've read 1-21 of the Thoroughbred Series. This book is very good! It keeps you interested. Since I have been reading the TB series I've learned SO much about racing. The Triple Crown, Preakness, Jim Bean, Belmont and tons more! This book is about how the courage of one girl & horse can go such a long way! To win the Triple Crown even! Super book!"
4,New,don't get me wrong i loved the book. But there are a lot of gaps. The writing is not oif the same quality. It is a great racing book and i will keep reading it. but i cried when sammy and tor got into a fight and when storm diesd and when wonder got sick but know it is like yeah whatever. I still like the other writers buit Joanna Campbell please come back. And there serie are starting to go on to long about one horse or one person. Just count the books on Ashleiugh and then SDammy and the n Cindy and then Christina. get the picture.
4,it was a good book but it needed more,"ok first of all it was really weird that they just worried about everything in the beginning and then he just wins the triple crown just like that ? i mean come on it pathetic he has to be a super horse like secretariat or something . champion's dam wonder was a good race horse but jazzman was kinda a nobody in the racing and all of a sudden he wins the triple crown , thats ridiculous but anyway it was a good read over all."
2,The Fantasy world of Thoroughbred,"First off, this book just wasn't planned well. They tried to slide six months into 199 pages and that just didn't work well. By the time we were actually in the Triple Crown the whole thing was completed within three chapters. Suspenseful? Not really. The whole thing was so downplayed. Back with Pride raced it was actually exciting. A second thing, this book just doesn't know what's going on. Post position draws for any race are not run like that in reality. For anyone who actually knows what happens in the racing industry, most of what is written in this book shows how much Bentley knows about racing. It shows that she didn't even bother to actually watch a real race or read a simple racing publication to tell her what races are what and when they are run."
5,Nice Small Bible,This is a great Bible to have in your purse not to heavy but you can still read it. I tote it around with me wherever I go. It is nice to have the headings too. It also has nice flexible leather. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have an index.
2,Magnifier; Pocket,"The Donegan Pocket Magnifier is of acceptable Quality. Themagnification of each of the two lenses is about the same.An oportunity has been missed; My other pocket magnifiers havelenses of substantially different powers. This gives me threeuseful magnifications: Each individual lense, and then theircombination."
4,collector's stable,"this cd as other claudio villa cds is required for the collector. as with the other cds, the selections from the 1950's reign supreme, although his voice is superb throughout his career. the wonderful music is only a small fix for the villa fan. what is missing on almost all claudio villa cds is liner notes ( recording dates, orch., acc. singers ). this info would aid the collector in buying various available renditions of many songs.."
1,I just didn't like it. It said something ...,"I just didn't like it. It said something about helping to rid me of bad breath, and it didn't."
1,Highly Dissapointed!,I bought this because they said it was a Breath Remedy Toungue Scraper. That is a brand name. They are false advertisers and they make me hesitant in using Amazon.com services! I wrote them once and did not get any response.
5,Best Tongue scraper,"I've tried a few different types or brands of these tongue scrapers. I prefer this brand over the others I've tried because it doesn't cut my tongue. I love it. The others have all left me bleeding with only a little pressure, they are too sharp. Also, the edges of the other brands are more narrow, which I think makes the outside edge part of the cutting problem. This particular brand has a wider edge that is more rounded so it doesn't cut you, yet is sharp enough to get close to the surface of the tongue. Definitely makes the mouth feel cleaner.Didn't like the $5 shipping charge for a each 2 oz device. Especially because I ordered a few at once and they all came in one package, but I assume that's how they make their money. Would be nice if they lowered the cost for bulk purchases."
1,Not so good...,Doesnt do a good job.. Too blut of an edge. the swath is also narrow.. will not recommend.
4,Fresh,Every one needs to have one of these. This one inparticular is one of the 3 that I have found most Effective. You really see and notice the difference!!!
3,Art Clock Review,Colors didn't match what was shown on the internet. Too green! Doesn't match my kitchen decor.
1,Misleading description,"The description of this product says ""high quality reproduction of an original acrylic painting decoupaged on wood"". Lets see, this high quality reproduction is merely a glossy photo of the painting. The wood is so light that a moving air from a fan can trip it over. Decoupage part I was not able to understand at all."
2,Small. Overpriced.,"It is cute. However, it's too small and noticeable only in small spaces. Seems cheaply made. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't pay more than $15 including shipping. Save your money."
3,"Brad, Brad, Brad !","I was really getting tired of Brads insecurity . One minute you think Brad starts to trust the handsome and fabulous Troy and their relationship and the next he's back doubting him and trying to destroy the relationship . After a while I got tired of this back and forth emotional roller coaster (3/4 of the book)and started to wish Troy would just dump Brad and move on. The story got better around the last 50 pages so I was glad I hung in for finish . I bought the book because the authors were in town (Ptown) promoting the book . Who knows maybe the book just hit too close to home in a, been there done that, sort of way ."
1,Pathetic Revisionism,"The Epsicopal Church's main proponent of blessing homosexual unions basically justifies his view by trying to discredit or at least minimize the interpretation of Paul's writings by painting him as a self-hating, repressed homosexual. Typical agenda driven liberalism - not theology."
1,"Starts with a few points worth pondering, then gets lost.","The author takes very little time in turning what could have been an interesting book and turns it into a political, homosexual normalization diatribe."
2,Very Poor and Lame Production,"I thought this movie was weird and boring. The kids hate it. Its got a little moral to it, but its pretty cheasy and the acting is very bad. Its almost like a bunch of neighbors got together and said ""let's make a movie"". I think this film is a waste of money and a backyard production. I was not impressed."
3,"On time, twisted ...","The books arrived on time, just a corner of the two books was a little twisted. That's not very important but for the price ..."
5,Green's Operative Hand Surgery,The book is beautiful with great content. The condition of the book is neat and perfect with incredible discount and the best is that the book was new!!The books (two volumes) arrived much quickly than expected. I do recommend this seller
5,One of the best shower gifts I received,"I loved this when I opened it at my shower. It's a really sweet memory book, and a nice place to help us remember some of the milestones in our life. There's enough space to get somewhat detailed, but not so much that I will feel overwhelmed each year, or forced into it. I recommend it highly!"
1,Personalized note written in book and stains on cover,"I purchased this gift for my wife for our 1 year anniversary. Paid for expedited shipping, the gift arrived and once she opened it we found it had already been written in and has stains on the front & rear cover. She was disappointed and so am I. They were willing to except the return but honestly the product was listed as used, in good condition but I am expected to pay for return shipping which I believe is extremely unfair considering the dishonest listing."
5,Excellent gift!,I originally purchased this book for myself and thought it was just beautiful. I have purchased at least 6 more of these books for friend's weddings and anniversaries. All of them have enjoyed it as much as my husband and I.
5,Our Wedding Anniversary Memory Book,Purchased this book as a wedding shower gift a year ago and visited the couple this year and they loved writing about their first anniversary and look forward to writing about the upcoming ones. I would love to have one myself!
4,Exactly what I was looking for...,"After searching around for this type of book for my sister's first anniversary, I was very happy to find this one. A few years ago I had bought myself a book similar to this at Hallmark, and I was disappointed to find out they no longer carry it. This book is a great way to keep track of your yearly happenings as a couple. There's a space for a photo each year. It's a great gift idea!"
5,Start a tradition,"I found this book shortly after I married just over two years ago. I thought it was really original and a great way to make each anniversary a special time. My husband and I have only celebrated two anniversaries, but each year as we sit down to read over the last years, write and reflect on the year just past, we enjoy it more each year. I highly recommend this book--just think of the memories when you look back over 50 years one day! It is a great tradition to begin."
5,Our Wedding Anniversary Memory Bood,"This is a great product. Just enough space for each anniversary to jot down some notes and keep a photo. You don't have to write a book. I bought this book for my daughter's first anniversary and it was so well-liked and used, that I bought 2 more copies to save for my other daughters when their 1st anniversary comes around.The illustrations decorating the pages are beautiful and add just enough beauty without going overboard. I wish I had had this when my husband and I started celebrating our anniversaries!"
2,DVD 2001 Filmed in 1967,"Not meant to be accurate, but a nice old cowboy and indian story.When I saw 2001 on the DVD, I thought it might include ideas and facts from Stephen Ambrose book.Too bad for me."
2,Everything you think you know about Custer,"is probably wrong. Including this movie.This ""movie"" from the 1967 ABC series ""Custer"" is just plain wrong in everything. Poorly produced, Indians all wrong even when the series was trying to make them sympathetic. Custer as a single man, no mention of family (which was the core of his life) because that would have been too restraining for the TV show.I gave it a 2 as a curiousity of the time.And FYI it's Wayne MauNder. Who went on to another tv western then disappeared. I believe he was a record producer into the 90's."
1,Crazy Horse & Custer.,"Thinking this was some obscure italian western I might enjoy,WRONG.Crazy Horse & Custer, turns out to be some old T.V.film from somewhere,Made in the U.S.A. The film is interesting in a strange sort of way but let down by a really lousy transfer.Though at only [price],not too much of a dissapoinment."
5,Bosch Oxygen Sensor,"This O2 sensor is about as close to OEM as you can get for your vehicle! My 94 Probe was really running rough and that unburnt gasoline smell coming from the engine was ugly....ditto for the check engine light coming on. I reset the computer, installed the new O2 sensor and within 200 miles, no more check engine light and no more ugly gasoline smell! She's running 100% better now but this brand of sensor comes highly recommended! San Antonio, TX {Home of the Spurs!}"
1,"CD awful, book Ok","The book is written for beginners; children who are beginners. The accompanying CD is absolutely awful. The reading in French does not sound like native speakers. The reading style is very unnatural. The voices of the readers are high pitched, and their attempts at drama are irritating, not entertaining. It sounds as if it is being read by a couple of junior high students, although that is not the case. In sum, I would not choose to buy this even for my children for more than 5 dollars."
3,not as good as i had hoped,"This is fun, but like a good joke is best the first time you hear it. Bluegrass versions of ""popular"" songs, pretty good musicianship, worth a fun listen about once a year, or for making your kids laugh."
4,great cd if u like real rap real hip hop buy this cd,buy this cd because its a head bopin cd a cd that u can listen 2 with out changen songs.
3,Why does everyone thing a good cd is great?,"This is a 3 1/2 Star cd. I would like to know why everyone who writes a review either thinks its the best rap cd of the year or the worst. This is a good cd, but not great. I admit I was very disappointed in his first cd. This however is a great improvement. He has come back much stronger, but it is still lacking something. I would definetly go get this cd because this is just a sign to come of what Cassidy has to offer. I hope he gets out of jail, and comes with some more fire. Stand out tracks include: The Problem vs The Hustla, I'm A Hustla, On The Grind, Crack, Can't Fade Me(with Nas), 6 Minutes of Death(Fab and Lil Wayne), The Message, and I'm A Hustla Remix."
4,He's Back!!!,"B.Reese (Cassidy) is back in hs grind. After is commercialized, cake ass first debut, split personality. He wanted to show everyone critic and hater that he's still on top. he went crazy on this album but to bad he cant get to celebrate his own album release.well i know hes innocent so until to get out hold ya head up cass."
3,"For True Cassidy Fans, Which I'm Not!","Cassidy tried to take ova' the rap game with this album. Too bad he failed miserably. This is another bad sounding album just like Split Personality was. ""I'ma Hustla"" is a tight song i agree, I rush to my T.V. set to watch the video, but what about the other songs? They sound like trash, wit' wack beats by Swizz. Cassidy needs to shy away from Swizz, and team up with Just Blaze if he wants to be a permanent success in the rap game. Oh Yeah, look out for my man AZ with his new album comin' out in August! I'm Out!!!"
2,Hit&Miss,"I dig Cassidy's Flows&the way he puts certain things down,but He still doesn't have it all together yet as a Artist to determine which way he will roll.His Mix tapes are on Point,but His Major Album Releases have Moments,but nothing that quite rivals His flow on the Mix tape Underground area.this ain't a Bad album,but it ain't quite Good either to me.better than His Debut.I dug ""Hotel"" with Him&R.kelly but I also saw a Cat being used for a Accessible Sound&Groove."
5,The Hustla on top,"This is a great CD but thier is still room for improvement, Cassidy is by far the best freestyler in the game right now!the best singles are the one with lil wayne,and fabolous, and also the first track is crazy!!!"
3,Not a Hustla Homie,"Don't get me wrong, cassidy has a sick flow and killa punch lines, but this album wasn't what I thought it would be. (To me) Swizz should have handled a little more of the production load. This album is not a complete waste, but it could have been a tad better..."
4,great product,"Received the mount in two days. All hardware is top notch, mount is very sturdy and I felt comfortable hanging my plasma from it. Was up in less than 45 minutes and looks great in the room, I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a quality mount that is easy to install. The tilt adjust is a nice feature. Great Product."
4,George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"This grill is a great product. Was easy to assemble and works well inside or outside. Since it is electric, there is no mess like grills using charcoal. Also, no propane to worry about. Requires an outlet either indoor or outdoor. Easy to clean. Drains grease into a supplied pan. Gives you the option to use it on supplied stand or without. Has a thermostat control that heats up grill quickly and cools down almost as fast when done. Since it is rectangular, has more service to work with. Grill cover is light and easy to use. This grill is a great value for the price."
5,Great Kitchen Helper,I love the convenience of this grill and the many options it afford indoors as well as outdoors.
1,Item Broken When Recieved Terrible Customer Service,I purchased this item for a gift at Christmas and the entire bottom of the grill was broken upon delivery. We followed the exchange policy and contacted Toastmaster immediately for the replacement part and was told they would send it out. When a month went by and we received nothing we contacted them again and was told it was on back order. Well that was 4 months ago and many emails that are now unanswered and we haven't received any replacement parts and Toastmaster is now ignoring our emails.I will never order from Amazon or Toastmaster again for their terrible customer service and will be contacting the better business bureau with my complaint.
5,Exactly what I needed,"Extremely simple and easy to use device. Requires no external power source. Perfect for working at home and connecting my work laptop to my home keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Easilly switches between home computer and work computer with no added desk clutter!"
4,A simple reliable device for home usage,"The IT department in my company tried to used such a switch to connect two machines of mine: one is a Win XP Server, one is a docking station for an IBM ThinkPad running Win XP Pro. It just did not work: either mouse got no response, or keyboard, or both. So the IT guy threw it away and tried another one, same brand/model, still did not work.I picked up the one threwn by that IT guy and used it in my home, connecting two Win XP Home desktops. And it has been working for 3 months. It happened twice that I needed to unplug/replug the connections, probably due to that the switch got power supply from one machine which got turned off. Other that that, it has been working without any problem. Since I think I've tried it long engough, now I am going to get rid of one old moniter of mine."
2,Would not buy this KVM,"I was extremely surprised at how poor this KVM performed in my simple home setup. I have 2 ps2 machines (XP, RedHat9). I bought this and had to return it in one week because of the problems I had. First, I could never get any of my mice (Microsoft Optical Intellimouse, Microsoft Wheelmouse, and Logitech mouse) to be recognized. So, I just used the monitor and keyboard functionality for 7 days. While the switching between machines worked as advertised, I had keyboard problems. The KVM caused typed characters to be missed by the computer or a single keystroke would end up being recognized as 2 or 3 strokes of the same letter by the machine. My only option to get any work done was to slow my typing down significantly. I would not recommend this product and recommend users to pay the extra [money] for the Belkin 2-port KVM Switch (cables included but not built in unit)."
1,Avoid this product,"I bought this product about 2 years ago. It worked fine for about 3 months. Sat connected without switching for about 12 months. Recently I went back to using it and it just refuse to switch between the 2 computers any more. The LEDs would flip back and forth, keyboard and mouse does switch but the video just stay locked on the same PC. I have an IOGEAR KVM switch which I bought around the same time and that has worked flawlessly. Don't know what to do with this piece of garbage, can't return it. Sigh :-("
1,"Worked great for about a year, then kaput.",This switch was awesome for about 1 year. Purchased it in April of 2004 and until last night it worked flawlessly. Now the primary display blinks on and off repeatedly.5 stars for the switch in working order.-4 stars for crapping out after a year.= 1 star from me.
2,Doesn't fully support Logitech MouseMan,"This product does not fully support the Logitech MouseMan Optical mouse. Linksys' product data sheet claims ""Compatible with Virtually All PS/2 Keyboards and Mice"", but what they don't say is that all mice are treated as a generic wheel mouse. Once this KVM switch is installed the thumb button and other features of the MouseMan Optical mouse are lost."
1,Non-existent technical support,"I need several KVM switches of this general kind, but need to find out if this permits the use of a PS2 to USB adapter.Two hours on the phone with some folks in Bangalore (or thereabouts) has left me with more questions than answers.WHY would we buy a product from CISCO>/LINKSYS when their tech support people are so clueless?"
2,Laptop users beware,"Bought the product to connect a Compaq desktop and a Dell laptop, found that I couldn't use the product on the laptop due to mouse interface issues. READ THE LINKSYS FAQ BEFORE BUYING THIS PRODUCT FOR SIMILAR APPS. Probably ok for two desktop apps."
2,Frustrating to use KVM,"Having used an older Linksys KVM for several years, I chose Linksys again. Unfortunately this was not a good choice. The hot key switching does not always work. I use a Logitech Cordless keyboard and Cordless trackball and the double click does not get processed quick enough to switch about 25% of the time. Get a hard button KVM as well as hotkeys."
1,Possibly the worst KVM Switch I ever used,"As title says, this kit is possibly the worst KVM switch I ever used. I used this switch to connect my laptop (with a port replicator) and a desktop. When swtiched to the laptop, the mouse just hangs. In the rare occasions when mouse responds, the middle scroll button is not working. After removing the KVM switch and connect mouse directly to the port replicator the mouse works fine.The story is not finished yet. When switched to the desktop, the Video image on the monitor is twisting constantly. The mouse is responding yet the middle scroll button is still not functioning.All the problems go away when connecting keyboard, mouse and video directly to the machines. I don't know why this product gets high rating in the first place but I am pretty sure this KVM switch of mine will go to landfill pretty soon."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased this KVM switch about 5 months ago or so, and it has always given me a flaky performance. Switching between my laptop and desktop has been very intermittent in performance: sometimes it switches, sometimes it doesn't. Also sometimes the scroll lock key doesn't respond when you hit it twice to make it switch between machines. To make it work I have to unplug the switch from all my devices then plug them all back in. It is a very big pain in the rear! Also when I boot up only one machine it doesn't like that. It seems to like it better if you boot up both machines, ack! I hope this thing is under warranty; if not I will go with a different manufacturer. I am very disappointed with this Linksys product!"
3,Good price if you can live with slightly blury video,"The price on this switch/cable setup is very reasonable, however, I immediately noticed a slight and annoying blur on my monitor. The blur became so annoying that I've disconnected the cable and will likely not use it. I'm back to switching my keyboard, mouse, and monitor manually when I need to access my Linux box (or using VNC which is OK, but not as snappy as being at the console).I could definitely live with the bluring if I were using the switch on a set of machines that I access infrequently. Unfortunately one of these systems is my main computer that I spend 10+ hours a day in front of."
5,Does what it says,This product does exactly what it says that it will do. I am happy with the performance of this product. The only thing that I wish was different is that I would like a switch to toggle with to be located on the KVM itself instead of having to use the hot keys inorder to change computers.But this product is worth the money anyways and I would buy it again in the future.
1,"worked for about 1 minute, then died","I received it today, and connected it to my primary pc. As described in the manual, the little green light lit up. A few moments later the little green light went out. After that, the little switch never came back to life. The keyboard and mouse would not respond. Never attempted to connect my second pc.The receptacles for keyboard and mouse are not snug enough to securely capture the plugs. Any movement of the switch will dislodge the plugs."
2,All but Useless,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the most annoying problem with this dictionary is its limited vocabulary. The cover boasts 30,000 vocabulary entries, but they are most certainly not sufficient for anyone who wishes to communicate successfully in German. It is designed to be easy-to-read, with larger-than-normal print and plenty of white space, but I rather wish they had made the text a couple of sizes smaller and filled the extra space with useful vocabulary. It's also rather silly to give childish phonetic pronunciations for every word in the dictionary, since German is, in most cases, very phonetic and easy to pronounce in the first place. Conspicuously absent is some sort of section on irregular verb conjugation, such as can be found in many other similar dictionaries."
1,Stay Away,"As a long-time satisfied NAV user on the PC side I decided to go with NAV 9 for mac with my new iBook. I have tried running the scan three times. The first two I cancelled after 3 hours without completion. The scan runs slowly but just about grinds to a halt when scanning the python files (.pyc,.pyo, etc.). I am now in the middle of my third try and after 2 1/2 hours it is still going. I think it is shameful that Symantec would release this product as compatible with Panther when it clearly is not. The suggestions I have gotten from Symantec tech support have been worthless!"
1,Broken (Un)installation,"I couldn't be more disappointed. I have installed it successfully twice in the past, but my latest effort has been nothing but disappointment. I have been working on this for a number of hours, and continually get stuck on the NAV Update, where it successfully retrieves the various update files, but can't apply the last ""Virus Def"" (or at least couldn't Process it in 8 hours...). Worse, is that the product refuses all attempts to uninstall itself either (Unknown errors...). So, I'm left with a newly built machine, with a non-functioning NAV which won't successfully install nor uninstall. I am quickly reaching a point where I will need to wipe this disk and reinstall OSX from stratch. An anti-virus program should not be written so poorly to have to require this..."
1,Unnecessary,"Sure, you can buy this software and protect your Mac, but the question is, ""Why would you want to waste your money?"" There has not yet been one virus written for the Macintosh. (That's right, not a single one.) And even if you download a Windows virus, it won't work, because Windows programs can't run on Macs. Also, Microsoft Word's macro system can deliver viruses, but these do not operate on the Mac, much as a Windows virus cannot operate on the Mac. Don't waste your money on a product that protects you from viruses that don't exist."
4,A must read for every scuba diver,It promises to leave you hanging off the edge of your seat. A. K. Stanley has done a great job bringing the adventure of diving in a new light in a modern day world. Never again will you get narced without thinking of this book. I highly recomend this book every diver.
3,Acrobat 5.0 NOT included,"This item is a training manual: ""Abobe Acrobat 5.0 Classroom in a Book"". Acrobat 5.0 must be purchased separately. This was not entirely clear from the product description, and I thought it was an educational version of the software (which is comparably priced at my local student bookstore)."
3,"Okay, not great","I bought this for meditation aide following my gym workouts. While the music is relaxing and her voice is somewhat soothing, I found it hard to suspend myself completely due to the poor audio quality. It's not grainy or distorted, but when you're trying to relax your mind, the sounds of a fire truck siren in the background is distracting. That is just one example. I also heard people moving around in the background, bumping things, etc. Its like they took a half-decent microphone and did this in their living room, then added the music later.Those flaws may not be a deal-breaker for some, and if you're not using headphones you may not even notice. For me it sort of ruins the experience."
2,Too fast...,"I was looking for a good guided meditation to use after some breathing exercises. I downloaded this as it got good reviews.I was rather disappointed and frustrated after my first attempt. I have been meditating for 3 years and have found great guided meditations, but this one does not work for me: she asks several questions and only gives you a few seconds to visualize/receive the answers. Too fast! Her voice is nice, but the fact that I am still in the middle of visualizing the previous aspect/answer when she starts talking about the next topic, defeats the purpose of the meditation. All previous guided meditations have allowed me ample time... I'd rather sit there and wait than be rushed. Rushing is not a way to spiritual growth, in my opinion.If anyone can recommed better (or more patient) guided meditations, please reply. Thank you!"
4,Great Voice and imagery,I will be looking for more of Lisa's meditation CD's.Very enjoyable and just the right length. The music is very soothing and fits the imagery.
5,I really enjoy these meditations,They are wonderful and help me get into a peaceful and healing meditative state. I alternate one each day and really look forward to this time each day. I have heard probably 20 or so other meditation CD's and this is one of my favorites.
1,Very disapointed,"I bought this after all the good reviews, I think she spoke to fast doesn't really allow you to get in the zone, I didn't find her voice pleasing actually it was really annoying to me, so much that I had to turn it off after 5 mins. I also thought the scenery she was trying to create to be cheesy and hokey. Good thing this was cheap. These are my opinions, I understand... hopefully she is trying to do some good in the world, and I appreciate that, her style did not fit what I am looking for, sometimes you have to weed through the BS to find what your looking for."
3,Clear but repetitive,"Fine, but Isobel Aura, a mystic, visionary & healer has better meditations covering every possible situation in life and her meditations sound far more healing and centering always with a powerful empowering feel to them. She has a beautiful british melodic voice set to angel music. Isobel Aura's are far superior to any I have heard before."
5,Great way to relax,This CD really guides you through meditation easily and calmy. I have trouble staying focused during meditation but having someone guide you through it really helps!
5,Best Moisturizer Ever,"This is simply the best moisturizer I've ever used, by far. It does an exquisitely good job of moisturizing and then lasts and lasts for hours on end. It also has a very mild, inoffensive scent that is suitable for just about anyone. Although marketed for eczema-prone skin, it can be used by anyone of any age. A very high quality, French made product."
1,Did not work,"I used this for my girl with severe eczema and it didn't work. Perhaps this is more suitable for a baby with just sensitve skin, not full blown eczema."
1,Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream,I used this cream on myself when I had an eczema outbreak on my hands. Please do NOT use this on children/infants that cannot verbalize. It BURNED horribly. I have tried numerous types of hand creams with the same results. MY RECOMMENDATION would be to use the Aveeno cream product for children. It WORKS and was pain free.
1,Does't seem to help my little guy,"I love mustela's shampoo, face wipes, cleaning solution, and baby lotion, but this just doesn't do it for us. It doesn't help my little guys skin at all. I want to finish using it because it pretty expensive, but I am on the hunt for something moisturizing to help with his skin."
1,Main ingredient: petroleum jelly,The main ingredient in this is petroleum jelly which you can get for 99 cents at WalMart.Use Hydrocortisone 1% and it works wonderfully well for eczema. It's the only thing that helps me.
2,"It's OK, BUT try something else first!!","I bought the Mustela Stelatopia cream, the wash, and the milky bath oil when my little girl was about 1 month old. They somewhat worked for a little while, but they don't completely get rid of the red patches.... They work, but they are more expensive and they don't work as well as....OK, here is what works for my child: (1) I apply a thick layer of Cetaphil cream (not the lotion)all over after bath or whenever the skin looks irratated, (2) I stopped using any baby wash until the condition greatly improved, then only use baby wash no more than once a week, and rinse well. At the beginning, I applied Cetaphil on her several times a day. After about two or three days, all the redness went away. In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl's skin looks perfect."
4,nice smell,"One concern was the lack of a smell with most hypoallergenic products, however this one had a mild nice little smell. It did not disappear completely into the skin though....left a slight greasy film.Overall pretty good, but in retrospect I prefer the Davies Baby balm."
5,"Wow...no more problems with dry, itchy skin","This winter, my face was all dry and itchy. The facial cleanser (Kiehl's) and moisturizer (Ren for sensitive skin) that I've been using were just not working anymore. In fact, they were making my problem worse...my skin was getting more irritated, dry and red. I tried Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream which was advertised as good for eczema-prone skin. I've been using this for more than 2 months now and I no longer have a problem. I use the cream right after I wash my face in the morning (using Mustela cleanser) and reapply at night after cleansing before bedtime. No more dry, irritated skin! I'm so happy with this product and highly recommend it to my friends."
2,Did not work,"I am very ready to love it, I heard it is wonderful from exzema-prone skin. But it did not seem to work that well. My daughter kept complaining every time I put it on her, probably it stung her itchy skin a little. I do love the bath gell from this brand, it works great as soap for body/diaper area/shampoo."
1,Bad baby cream,"The cream is too oily, not easy to absorb. Thought it is fragrance free, it has a strong oily smell. And it doesn't work for my baby's eczema. I am thinking throw it away, but it is too expensive...."
5,A Compelling and Coarse Tale That You Will Not Be Able To Put Down!,"Shooting Dr. Jackwas a great crime story that I could not put down that made me run out to the bookstore to buy Norman Green's next three novelsThe Angel of Montague Street,Way Past LegalandDead Cat Bouncethe very night I finished it!Right from the get go Mr. Green makes you feel the pain and discomfort welling up in his characters anxiety ridden lives that are starting to spin wildly out of control. The novel's setting and characters are thoroughly believable, not like the usual unrealistic and trite type seen in all too many crime stories.The stories `less than upright citizens' end up in trouble with some `even less than upright citizens' (who are themselves in trouble with some `much less than upright citizens') and can only get out of danger by setting up an elaborate sting.All of this frenzied complication and suspense is brilliantly set to the backdrop of alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution."
3,Average First Novel,"Norman Green would like his ""Shooting Dr. Jack"" to be a gritty crime novel of the Andrew Vachss mode. Indeed, it has the right elements; shady underworld characters, a heartlss neighborhood, and and good amount of violence. Neverheless, it feels like a novel written by someone who has spent their life outside looking in at the world of crime. This novel, while interesting and with enough compelling characers to pull it along, never quite feels authentic. Despite its attempt t be street hip, it is actully quite conventional.Would I recommend this novel? I suppose I would to anyone who likes a good crime story. It is moderately ententaining, but not all that memorable."
1,I gave up after 100 pages and 3 tries,It didn't have anything to keep my interest. Maybe you have to live in NYC to like it.
4,Useful in the Kitchen,"I purchased this when it was one of the Amazon ""Deals"" and for the price I paid, this is an excellent product. The pizza cutter/server is poor and I do not use it, but the pizza pan and deep dish pan are excellent and alone worth the price. With the exception of the cutter/server, this is a resilient and well-made product that I highly recommend."
3,"Works fine, cutter cheap and not needed","The pan works to keep the pizza together, the finish keeps it from sticking and the perforated bottom, keeps the crust professionally crisp. I tossed the pizza cutter almost immediately as it was cheap and didn't really do the job. Other than that, you can't lose with this pan set!"
3,Seems worth the price,This was a daily special that I got caught up into buying. Haven't used it yet but seems substantial and I may give it as a gift because it's packaged so nicely but then again I may just keep it. It was a special price so seems worth it.
5,Fantastic,I have used this DVD many times. I enjoy it a lot. The descriptions are very precise and the instructor is good. I would say I am a beginner when it comes to yoga.
1,Not good for HelloGoodbye fans,DO NOT buy this CD if you are looking for something by HelloGoodbye (one word). This is by a totally different band with almost the same name: Hello Goodbye (two words). I was very disapointed with this CD because I was expecting something from my beloved HelloGoodbye. BE WARNED!
1,for the guy that also posted,your an idiot for buying this.it says most similiar to senses fail and static lullabydummy.
4,Overlooked history,"This is a terrific little book. I guess my only disappointment is that there aren't more personalities built into the first chapters. Those chapters are packed full of information, but not as story-like. As the friendship between Dicker and Hans developed, the story grabbed hold of me. And the last chapters - perhaps telling of times Hans could remember better - absolutely held my attention. As truth is stranger than fiction, it was impossible to know what would happen next. I read this during the holidays and I think it makes a great Christmas story, though certainly not limited to the holidays."
4,excellent flashlight,"This is a nice flashlight, and for someone who is not a gadget freak it is almost worth the $$.Two comments:1. The beam is bright, but cannot be focused, ala maglight.2.The self stick tape for the charger didn't last very long, it then has to be screwed to a wall for easy access.minor complaints for a tool grade light!"
2,"Works just ok, fogs way too quick",You have like 2 seconds to see your teeth because it fogs almost instantly...so its just ok
1,STUPID!,this had maybe one good story!I could write better from my life!!!its ok if you have nothing to do and its raining!dont expect anything more!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Writing is fine, but ultimately boring","It's well written but I got bored quickly. It may be the authors, or it may be because many of the stories are extremely short. There's no room to develop the story so all the characters end up seeming similar. I tried rereading a couple stories, thinking maybe I just wasn't in the mood the first time. But they weren't memorable the second time either. When stories about menage a trois (or more) aren't memorable, something's wrong."
1,A disappointment,"I thought this would be hot and interesting, but the writing is somehow very ordinary and a disappointment. It's not a good sign when you have to force yourself to focus and finish a story about a threesome! It's all just sort of generic -- here's three people, they get it on, here's three more,they get it on, etc, and none of the characters very interesting, or even sexy."
4,pretty straightforward,"This book is definitely interesting and well written, and puts forth generally plausible ideas from many bright, well respected people. A few of the ideas seem a bit hard to swallow, such as Paul Ewald claiming that many of the major human diseases, such as bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's, will be shown to be caused by viruses. But for the most part the book is plausible, interesting, and even somewhat entertaining. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
5,Excellent collection of essays,"In brief, the book covers a very wide range of scientific disciplines and has the courage in its essays to try and estimate how the future in the various disciplines will pan out. There are some very interesting trends in current research brought to light, and some very interesting put downs of old trends that were accepted by the scientific community and the public at large. A good read, with varied fields covered. Language is at the level an educated layperson can understand."
3,I don't think I'd use this product without ...,"I don't think I'd use this product without the tongue scraper, as it seemed to only do half the job. It didn't taste bad. Perhaps the tongue scraper and spray could come as a set."
4,It worked quite well -- one would expect ...,"It worked quite well -- one would expect the name alone would be enough to scare bad breathe away. There were two minor things that I didn't like, however. One was the taste. My wife has an aerosol breath spray that really tastes good. This one has a medicinal aftertaste to it. The other has to do with the tongue scraper. It sounds fairly silly, although I suspect it would help. I'd be startled if I walked into a restroom and observed another person scraping away. I'd be reluctant to use such a device without complete privacy."
5,An inspirational plan for success!,"Successoloy, is by far the most powerful and comprehensive plan for success I have ever encountered. Scott Rogers has managed to create a book that addresses both the personal and business side of an individual's life. With humor and an easy style of writing, Successology, teaches one to evaluate who you really are, what one projects to others, and then how one is perceived. The book is filled with tips, as well as, interactive worksheets in the form of questions and quizzes. He concludes the book with a ""Success Formula"" that is truly brilliant!As a side note, after reading this book, I had an opportunity to attend one of Mr. Roger's seminars. The book can only be surpassed by his live presentation of ""The Science of Success"". He truly personifies all the lessons he so cleverly teaches. His wit and wisdom are inspirational. This is a must read!"
1,That '70s Catechism,"No reliable information on authentic Catholicism in these pages. However, as a period piece, it may have some utility to those trying to appreciate the confusion in the Church in the days following the Second Vatican Council on the part of those who took most of their information from the media without actually reading the conciliar documents."
4,Good Overview of the Faith,"I thought the book was excellent. Perhaps those that have written critical reviews are better schooled than I in the teachings of the Church. The book is easy to read, thoughtful, and gives references for further reading.I would always agree that reading the catechism is also desirable. The U.S. catechism is also fairly new, and also very well written. But this book would be a good place to start to learn about the catholic faith."
1,Book for thinking Catholics?,"Many claim this book is for ""thinking"" Catholics, a term associated with a group of American Catholics who wish to forgo two thousand years of tradition to conform the Church to their expectations of modern, American, liberal morality.Quite simply, this book is a blending of the teachings of the Catholic Church with the moral beliefs of the Democratic party. The truth is watered down to cohere most generously with the sensibilities of certain Catholics in America.This book is not loyal to explicit Church teachings. Notable areas of dissent include contraception, the ordination of women, and basically every other tenet of the Catholic faith which is rejected by ""liberal"" Catholics.It saddens me that this book is used for RCIA classes. WARNING! If you are looking for a book to teach you the Catholic faith or a book for an RCIA class, LOOK ELSEWHERE! Learn pure, unadulterated truth. Ignore feel-good stuff like this."
1,Horrible,This book is one of the worst I've seen on presenting Catholic truth. The fact that it has been so widely used explains one reason why so much confusion exists on Church doctrine. Don't buy it.
3,new Convert,"I am a new convert to Catholicism and just got confirmed this last easter vigil. I was given this book by one of my RCIA instructors. I just recently ""found"" it and began to read it only after I was confirmed. I read it in almost one sitting (not in order of course). I think this is a great book that gives nice historical contents and some ah ha moments. This being said,after having already finished my RCIA course and all of my questions were answered there, in the catechism or on detailed books in areas where I wanted additional information. i will say that I thought the chapters on the Bible and on Saints/Mary were very good and are great for references.If you are a ""Cradle Catholic"" and are feeling out of touch I suggest this not be the book for you. I think it is too Protestant and TOO BASIC I would suggest signing up for the RCIA program. It is not just for converts, anyone who wants to know the Faith/Religion more are invited to attend the weekly meetings."
1,"not awful, but definitely not authoritative","Wilhelm treatment of theological and moral issues tends to be much more liberal and subjective than official Church teachings. I wouldn't go so far as to call him or the book heretical, but I would caution against taking this book as any sort of official compendium of Catholic doctrine"
1,Catechizing Against Catholicism,"Heretical. Wilhelm presents incomplete offical Catholic teaching in many areas, often followed by discussion of why he believes a Catholic does not have to believe or follow those teachings. He never defends the Catholic teachings with which he obviously disagrees. He endorses dissent in issues such as the immorality of all abortions, ordination of women, the existance of Hell, the immorality of contraception, calling God ""Father"" and many others. Not a book anyone interested in authentic Catholicism has any business reading. The Catechism of the Catholic Church is where you find offical Church teaching."
1,Disturbing Book,"Years ago, when I owned an earlier edition of this book, a Protestant friend opened it randomly to discover what was, I think, a heresy. I suggest avoiding this book."
1,Inaccurate Presentation of Church Teaching,"Not only does this work currently not have an imprimatur, it originally had one. However, the Vatican, after many years and likely complaints, forced the bishop to withdraw his approval from the book. This is a very, very uncommon occurance, and shows the subtle danger in this book. Just because it selectively quotes Church documents does not mean that it is faithful to the teaching of the Church. The material on conscience and many moral issues are especially dangerous. This book DOES have an excellent lay-out, and is easy to read and understand. If only it actually taught Catholicism!"
4,Interesting Storyline,"Martyr's Cry:A Bishop Hunter Mystery by Larry D. Bohall, is an interesting story with well-developed characters, dialogue, and plot. A very appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc.Beverly Hills, California"
3,entertaining but predictable,"A friend recommended Martyr's Cry by Larry Bohall and so I ordered the book (being the huge mystery freak that I am). I found this writer's story entertaining enough though it was a predictable story. I did enjoy the heroine however. Would I read another book by writer Bohall? Yes, I think I would."
5,Buy this book!!,This is a theology students dream. It must have taken one many years of serious study and labor to compile scripture references in this way. Passages from the holy books of every major and most minor religions are represented here and grouped side by side by topic for quick comparison. On almost every subject the harmony of thought is staggering! It makes one wonder why religious leaders ever quarrel with one another. It's a great book for study and even better to browse. I started reading it in my doctor's waiting room and got hooked. I found myself actualy looking forward to going to the doctor! If you'd like to sample divine wisdom from many cultures and ages. Buy this book and you'll refer to and enjoy it for a lifetime!
5,A testament to the brotherhood of man.,"This book takes different topics such as faith, dealing with adversity etc. and quotes various sacred text that discuss that topic. This book is a wonderful testament to the fact that we all believe in the same God even though we may call him by a different name and that we are all brothers and sisters. This book opened my eyes and introduced me to some sacred texts that I had never heard of and would like to learn more about."
4,a treasure,Great for presentations and sermons to use all of the sacred writtings the world has to offer in a logical manner.
5,Perfect,I've always believed there can be common ground within religious & idealogical thinking and this book seems to support that idea. A wonderful resource for anyone interested in better understanding the basic tenets of someone else's faith system and how it can relate to heir own. A must for anyone dealing in the humanities and especially for anyone studying comparative religion .
5,Heavenly,I had read parts of this book online but it's so nice to have the book itself. I have been reading a few pages every morning to start my day. What a testimony both to God's love and human brother- and sisterhood to see how much different religions really have in common. I am learning so much and am challenged to become a better person.
5,Sharp Enough to Make You Bleed,"Look, these are razor blades, so handle with extreme care. Why ""extreme"" care? Because they fit into a unit where the blade must be bent and a slide placed over the blade. It's during this process that you're most likely to be injured. It reminds me of a similar tool from 20 years ago that used X-acto blades to remove callouses. Well, both did the job and both make me nervous. And since you're about to use this on the bottom of your foot, they are more apt to slip. You can't have it both ways, but you can be careful."
2,Mixed Feelings,"This outlet cover comes as a single or as a 2-pack.In the single pack case, the contents are: the outlet cover, two screws, a spacer (similar to a washer), and 2-3 screw covers.I bought four outlet covers, and found them to be a little cumbersome to install. Once they were installed, I noticed that 2 of the four didn't work properly. Evidently, if you screw them down so that they don't feel loose on the wall, the snap-back mechinism doesn't snap back. I loosened it until it snapped back, but now the outlet cover feels loose.I returned them and got the horizontal safety outlet covers. Those you can screw in tightly and it doesn't affect the snap back. Plus, the horizonal ones have fewer parts. Additionally, the top of the screw that comes with it, is painted to match the plastic. (The draw back is that it is almost twice the price.)"
5,A REAL Film Classic,"I normally do not review films. I don't consider myself a ""movie-nut"" or anything like that. But, there are exceptions. The Graduate is truly a classic work of filmmaking. The acting by all is top-notch. The chemistry/tension between Benjamin and Mrs.Robinson is absolutely amazing. Ben encapsulates in his character what almost everyone has felt at that point in their lives - the lack of direction, the loneliness, confusion,etc. I also like the fact that the end is not a pretty, happy-ever-after kind of thing. Although he does get the girl, the expressions on their faces betray a bit of insecurity and uneasiness. I found that to be very realistic. Such is life. It is rarely 100% good. An astounding piece of work. Yes, it is old, and those weaned on Adam Sandler movies will find it slow and uninteresting, missing the finer points of true acting and great directing at its finest. Classic."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"There's been so much written about this classic movie, but I'd never seen it until recently. With that said, the movie isn't as funny as I had expected or hoped. Some of it might be Dustin Hoffman's acting - I like him in other movies, but he comes off pretty annoying here. Part of it might be that the movie pushed cultural boundaries and spoke to issues in the 1960s that don't have as much resonance today. Some scenes were just too over the top - like Hoffman's parents forcing him to go scuba-diving in the pool. I just don't get the humor there.The movie made great use of Simon and Garfunkel songs for the soundtrack! It really becomes part of the film and tells the story. Frankly, it's probably the best part of the movie. It would be nice if more movies weaved pop music in their films.Bottom line: if you liked The Catcher in the Rye (or stories like it), you'll like The Graduate. If you're like me and hated that book, you won't find the movie that exciting either."
2,Couldn't relate,"Knowing very little about camera angles, sountracks, lighting, and so forth, I can only talk about the story line which, I must say, is absolutely horrid. A college graduate fools around with his parents' (married) best friend AND their daughter. Are there repercussions? Sort of, but he still gets the girl in the end. The one redeeming quality of the movie is the symbolism discussed in the reviews below. But the story simply left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
4,as I remember it,"Boy, super listening to the simon and garfinkel music again. All the good feelings come back. The picture in blue ray is sharp and the music delightful. Story still holds up. ""Plastic""Mrs. Robinson are you trying to seduce me. YES."
5,Hello ripoff my old friend,"I give it five stars because it is great film. As for my title, that is because I got the DVD for my dad for Christmas. But, I got him the regular edition. He said after watching it, that its funny that the DVD edition of the most important film of the 60s doesn't have any special features. Little did we know that there is another edition with special features. The Sound of Ripoff."
3,Lack of director's commentary,"I agree with Daniel that the lack of the director's commentary on this DVD is lamentable.Nichols' commentary track some years ago for the Laser Disc edition is, to my mind, the very best audio commentary ever made."
4,Excellent Movie - So-so DVD,"This is my favorite movie of all time. There is a lot more here than a comic love story. The more you watch it the more you understand it. However, I was disappointed with the DVD. I also have the Laserdisc and the sound quality and the commentary on it are far superior to the sound and the extra stuff on the DVD. Nevertheless, you can't beat this movie so if this is your only format option - get it!"
2,"""Graduate"" should go to summer school","Would you really want to see a movie that has to be explained to you? I don't know what THE GRADUATE is supposed to mean. Like 2001 A SPACE ODDYSEY and MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE GRADUATE does a great job of confusing the heck out of you to the point where you think you must have seen something great. THE GRADUATE is worth seeing (for free, on TV) once, I guess, because it takes you somewhere (an affair with your girlfriend's mother) the movies rarely go. Also, the late Norman Fell does a superb job playing the kid's landlord. Director Francis Ford Coppola uses symbolism well in pictures such as THE OUTSIDERS because his imagery relates to the story. But the director of THE GRADUATE must have thought symbols could substitute for a story. They ought to send THE GRADUATE to summer school, or better yet, film school."
1,I am confused!,"Let me see if I get this right about this ""classic"" film of the 60's. Boy graduates from College, then has a torrid, sordid affair with his Dad's best Friend/Business Partner's Wife.He then goes thru a phase of alienation with his parents. Then he breaks off the affair with Ms. Robinson in order to stop the marriage of her daughter. So that he can run off with her. There by by ruining Dad's business and a marriage.But on the plus side it has a great musical score. It sounds a lot like something out of Larry Springer to me. But then I could be wrong!"
1,The worst movie I have ever seen!,"I don't understand why everyone likes this movie so much. To me, it is absolutely the worse film i have ever seen. We saw it in my film study class and i just couldn't even stand to look at the screen after a while. it is extremely boring, the script is the kind of funny that you get, but don't feel like laughing at, the music is okay, but can't salvage the movie, and the directing is just asking for people to fall asleep. i'm not someone who goes for meaningless movies, quite the contrary. however, i don't see any meaning or symbolism in this movie at all, i think it looks like something that is a very bad, first attempt at filming. i could probably do better in my backyard with a camera. don't watch it, it'll be the worse, most boring time of your entire life! i wouldn't even give it any stars, i'd give it negative stars if that was a choice!"
1,"Bad movie, no donut","I was 21 when this came out, it was pointless then and still is.Hoffman was no actor and still is not."
3,OVERRATED DONT YOU THINK?,"Im a huge fan of films, and I find unique aspects in films that make me enjoy a film much more than possibly the average viewer.This film is not only incredibly boring in my opinion, but Dustin Hoffman is unbelievably annoying to the point of wanting to strangle him. This is not bad film making by any means, but definitely NOT to my taste."
4,The Graduate,"Good movie, Although What would you do if it happen to you? I am not Mr. Goodie two shoes, But I think I wouldn't give into the temptation,so it's messed up what he did. I mean ,darn right cold. So there is No Morals Or ""Morale"" to this story. I don't think he should be forgiven."
4,Classic addition,"You can't go wrong adding ""The Graduate."" I enjoyed the Dustin Hoffman interview extra. Don't expect too much from old classics on the DVD extras. The movie though has upped my collection in quality classics for sure."
3,bringing back the 60's,I saw this movie quite awhile ago so I don't know what is going to be different about the new relase but when I saw it I thought that it was very typical of the times that it was made in. Dustin Hoffman was young and wrinkle free and he was very new to the whole acting scene. I felt that there were some slow spots in the movie and his part made me feel slightly uncomfortable but I really enjoyed the music in the movie so I guess that I would see it again.
3,Audio Commentary,"I own the LD version of this movie. It was put out by Criterion, which continues to do a wonderful job re-releasing classics on the DVD format (check out their ""Joan of Arc""). And, yes, I have listened to the informative, witty and incisive audio commentary a numbe of times. It was not Mike Nichols who gave the audio commentary. It was UCLA film professor, Howard Suber."
4,ONSLAUGHT OF TIME,"You cannot really mess with or criticise a classic, can you? I don't want to anyhow, but I guess I can just add my stamp of approval to a film that is timeless. The same dynamics could be at work between people and within human relationships at any time in history. This film has given us a commonly known reference to predatory middle aged women ""Mrs. Robinsons"". The film is remembered for its original story, its brilliant performances, and for launching the career of Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross. Anne Bancroft, too, was brilliant. Simply an unforgettable film with unforgettable images."
5,Recent college grads should see this!,"I saw this movie because the author of the book that the movie was based on went to my alma mater (Williams College) and Ben was supposed to have graduated from there, though its never mentioned by name in the movie. Anyways, I found it very amusing how the old saying that the more things change the more they stay the same holds true in this movie; there will always be college grads who are clueless as to what to do next! The DVD picture quality was excellent."
1,Another utterly pointless re-release from MGM!,"This DVD is just the (also utterly pointless) re-release from 2005 with ""Best Sellers"" slapped onto the cover. The re-release I'm talking about contains the same exact transfer as the 1999 Special Edition DVD. It's non-anamorphic, just like the SE, and contains the same extras that you can find on the SE, which were ported from the 25th anniversary laserdisc.My advice to fans of this film: Try to find the original 1999 special edition DVD."
5,The Sound of Silence...,"is what you would have heard before i reviewed this movie. I am astonished i am the first person to take a minute out of their day to do it. I mean the music is incredible. Hoffman is incredible. However, in spaces he seems to overact and become less than human, nearly flat. This is the only knock on the movie, however. Hoffman is brilliant in most places. His ability to keep a straight face in places is admirable. The camera work is original, especially the scene in which hoffman is submerged by his parents into their pool. Bancroft does a wonderful job. Its worth owning for the music alone people."
4,Jennifer's The Graduate Review,"The film The Graduate is a classic 1967 release that is directed by Mike Nichols and released by Embassy Pictures. The film earned $50 million in 1968, which is number one money maker in that time.Director, Nichols, won the Academy Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for 6 other Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actress. The soundtrack featuring songs by Simon and Garfunkel was gold in 1968 and ""Mrs. Robinson"" was number one on the charts for four weeks.College grad (Dustin Hoffman) does what his parents and other people tell him to do including family friend Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who tells him to have an affair with her. Then he falls in love with her daughter Eliane Robinson (Katherine Ross), and finally finds something he wants to do with his life.I give this film 4 stars because I thought Dustin Hoffman did a good job. I thought that the music complimented the movie nicely as well. It was a good film."
3,What can I say...Dustin Hoffman rules.,"This is sort of a romantic/dark comedy/drama. Dustin Hoffman does such a good job in this film, his voice is just so perfect for the part...it's sort of fun just listening to it. I rented this film right(well not right after but) after I saw Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" which is now my new favorite film, I read an article that compared the two movies, you can see the similarities in the two films ""Garden State""is more or less ""The Graduate"" of generation Y"
2,A boring movie not worthy of being in the Top 100 List,"The Graduate is the type of movie you only see once; it has nothing of charm or interest, I can't seem to understand why it's #7 in the top 100 movies of all times. The only thing good about it was the great score(soundtrack), but besides that you should be safe choosing something else. Sonia"
3,Major classic - again botched by MGM,"MGM took the initiative to re-release this major classic (one in my personal top-5 list.) But again they didn't bother to do it right.This release is served up as a non-anamorphic (non 16x9) widescreen edition. Translation: If you have (or when you get) a widescreen TV, it will look substandard.A better alternative, if you can play Region 2 PAL DVDs, is to get the Euro version, which is enhanced for widescreen TVs. In addition, the color rendition of the Reg 2 version is far superior to this one (and all previous Reg 1 versions). But that alternative isn't perfect as you have to deal with a 4% speedup.Phooey on MGM."
2,Non-Anamorphic Again,"I thought that MGM was re-releasing ""The Graduate"" to provide consumers with an anamorphic transfer.Wrong, wrong, wrong.If you have the original DVD from a few years ago, you may as well keep it. For some reason, MGM has chosen to provide another non-anamorphic transfer - which begs the question: Why bother to re-release the DVD?Very disappointing."
5,THE Coming of Age Movie,"This one is fantastic and very relevant even now a days. Dustin Huffman's breakout film has wonderful performances by all of the actors, a great story, beautiful filmography and a fantastic sound track by Simon and Garfunkle."
4,Mike Nichols Classic Film,"I must say when i first saw this movie i fell in love with the story. Yet it does become repetitious towards the end. This is the movie ""i am certain of"" that made Dustin Hoffman what he is now.""Are You Trying to Seduce me Mrs. Robinson?"""
1,Raving insanity at it's most boring,"The worst movie I ever watched all the way through. I was drawn in by the high rating and awards, but then spent the whole show waiting for the movie to get moving.The characters are totally unconvincing, there is no sensible motivation for any action through the whole show, just wildly implausible things behavior no logical cause. Pathological non-functionality. Neurotic Passionate obsession with strangers. Raving insanity at it's most boring.There was some random nudity and a few minutes of stripping, perhaps this is a ""tame"" old fashioned version of scandalous, plot-less pornography?"
5,Simply Great Movie,"This one of the top ten best movies ever made and the Simon and Garfunkel sound track is one of the best ever written.Well directed,acted and written. Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are wonderful but do is everyone else including Kathryn Ross and William Daniels Look for the late great Norman Fell and quick on screen appearances by Mike Farrell, Buck Henry and Richard Dryfuss."
2,Goofy,"All of the characters are cartoon figures. This is an 'intelligent, funny satire' only in the sense that 'Springtime for Hitler' was too. 'The Graduate' is a filmthat appeals most to those who are too short for true satire."
2,only turning 21?,"Why was Benjamin JUST turning 21 at the time of his college graduation? Most people have have been, at the youngest, turning 22 at this time. Did I miss a line about him skipping a grade, perhaps?"
2,Just not that good....,"There are two things that even make this movie tolerable. First is the way it is directed. The camera angles and the scene to scene directing are really cool to watch. Second is the great soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkle. It kicks in at just the right time and really adds to the movie. That being said this movie stinks. The storyline is absolutely revolting. Can anyone honestly imagine doing what benjamin did? By the end of the movie I couldn't stand him. People make him out to be the hero of the movie, but he is actually just a stupid kid. There were also a lot of holes in the plot. Benjamin seemed too old to be just graduating college, and he seemed too stupid to be 21. Also, I have no idea why elaine decides to go for him after he slept with her mother, many times. It is just too gross, weird, and stupid to ever happen. Don't ever pay any money for this movie, and AFI what the heck were you thinking? Number 7, please."
5,"Here&#65533;s to you, Mrs. Robinson","Heaven loves you more than you can say, hey, hey, hey. Some of the best music of the 60s, by Simon and Garfunkle, makes up the sound track for this iconic movie with Dustin Hoffman (looking impossibly young), Ann Bancroft (looking incredibly wicked and sexy), and Katherine Ross (looking incredibly innocent). Mike Nichols directed this film that highlights all that was good and bad about the 60s.Who among us will forget Hoffman standing at the bottom of the swimming pool in scuba gear during the party at which one of his father's business friends has just poked him repeatedly on the chest and said, ""I have one word for you, Benjamin. Plastics.""Coerce your teenage kids into re-watching this film with you. It'll give them a better sense of how it was back then than anything you could try to explain."
5,amazing lyrics,"This is an incredible landmark from my college days, when I played it unceasingly on my stereo and in my head during study breaks and philosphical walks on the beach or in the woods. The semi-depressed yet edgy and sometimes rebellious songs are Young classics for me from that period of my life. The power of music! One of my all-time favorite lines from many Neil Young favorites is on this album: ""Though my problems are meangingless, that don't make then go away..."" I use that one all the time. Thanks, Neil!"
4,doesn't play on Pioneer DV578-A,I have the same problem as another reviewer-I notice the frequency rate is 176khz which is rare. Maybe this entry level player cannot handle this output. Yet it plays on my cheapish Victor mini system (DVD-Audio) only available here in Japan. Strange.
1,Won't Play on Most DVD Players.,"I have 5 DVD players and 3 MacIntosh computers. This DVD-A disc WILL NOT play on most of my DVD (not CD) players. It will play on my computers! I have dozens of DVD-A discs , and they play on ALL my DVD players. This disc won't.I would have rated this disc higher (probably), if I could have heard it."
2,Very Disappointed!!!,"I am a huge Neil Young fan and that is the main reason why this album disappoints me.This is not classic material by the godfather of grunge; it is basically a commercial shot into a time where nearly everybody was trying to be a so-called singer/songwriter and trying to make money out of it.Dont get me wrong, there are some good songs here and there that are listenable, but, my expectations were much higher from one of my all time favourite musicians ever."
5,One of his Best--,I adored this one upon release on LP-and to this day still do-It is a great listen overall and a must have for any Neil Young fan-Walk On is a fantasic piece mostly in response to some Skynyrd comments off Sweet Home Alabama-holds up well thru the years..
5,Ambulance can only go so fast,"Long ago,I was told (or I read) that Neil Yong hated this album, maybe because of his personal circunstances by the time of producing it. Perhaps that was the reason why you could never get it on a regular CD until now. For me, that is one of his best. Two of the songs are really terrific: On the beach and Ambulance Blues (you should change your mind about this song, Neil; it is not a stupid tune: you touched the heart of many listeners by doing it; you moved my very soul!!)"
4,"A masterpiece from Young's ""dark"" period","Aside from the dull ""Vampire Blues"" and the annoying ""For The Turnstiles,"" this one is hard to match. ""Walk On,"" the only upbeat number on the release, is quite funky and features some of Neil's most creative electric guitar playing. The slow ""See The Sky About To Rain"" is atmospheric, highlighted by Neil's strong keyboard work. ""Revolution Blues"" ranks among Young's best electric tunes, with lyrics that are disturbing and funny at the same time. Great rhythm guitar work here from David Crosby. The second side boasts the moody ""On the Beach"" with memorable lines such as ""I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day,"" and the acoustic-themed ""Ambulance Blues,"" which I never grow tired of hearing. I'm not sure what Neil's trying to communicate (he admits in the lyrics, 'It's hard to say the meaning of this song'), but the music, featuring some unforgettable fiddle, more than makes up for the disjointed words."
5,Just heard for the 1st time and listened to it 5 times this week,Wow unbelievable that this was panned by the critics when it was released. It is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.
5,His most enduring album,"I got this album when it first came out on vinyl and thought it Neil's best album along with the harrowing Tonights the night. I read David Crosby ridiculing this album in Record collector a few years ago, and that has got to be enough of a recommenation to go out and buy it. Crosby has had a less than stellar solo career. This album, for me is somewhere between the Goldrush stuff and Crazy horse. I like the lyrics here especially, very different and memorable. The music is tasty without drowning out the lyrics as I feel is the case in some of the Crazy horse stuff. Nice album all round. It's nice to finally have a copy on CD"
4,One of my favorites,"I am so happy to finally see this album released on CD. While it may not have originally gained much critical acclaim, it was always one of my favorite Neil Young releases. Amulance Blues is one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard. And some of the lines in Revolution Blues are funny and scary at the same time. This album and the other recently released albums (Hawks and Doves, American Stars and Bars and Reactor) are not for a casual Neil Young fan. But, if you have acquired the taste for Neil, you will definitely want these albums"
5,Great Information,"Have seen and or hunted many of these animals discussed here, Many are more prolific here in Texas and doing really well. Some in greater numbers than in there own home lands."
5,Exotics on the Range; The TexasExaple,"I have Axis, Blackbuck and Fallow on my ranch. Other than brief synopsis on the net its very hard to find in depth detailed info. This is perfect and its provides the historical and biological information I have needed. It's well written, readable and gives all aspects. It far exceeded my expectations. I also appreciate that its hard bound for long term repeated use."
3,Green Prada small Militare nylon bag,I was so excited to get this in the mail. It is a great bag but it is small and the zipper is a little tough. After all women only shop for the brand names of things....am I right girls!!
2,Dualit lite toasters are made in China,"Response direct from Dualit:the only toasters that are not manufactured in China are the Dualit Claasic range, Newgen and Vario, these are manufactured in the UK, but the soft touch is now discontinued and replaced with the High Gloss. Only the 2 slot Lite toaster is manufactured in China."
1,Bagel setting doesn't work at all,"The ""bagel"" setting DOES NOT WORK! I thought it was a defective product, but after returning it for a replacement, the second one does the same thing. The outside heating elements do not turn off like they should, and the outside of the bagel gets burned.NOT recommended."
1,lasted only 18 months,"Paid over $72 in July, 2007. toast would pop out of toaster sometimes landing on floor. Occasionally worked but quality of toast not very good. Yesterday the handle wouldn't stay down and will have to discard it and purchase new one. Certainly not worth the money! Am buying cheapest one from Farm and Fleet store.disgusted from Milwaukee, wi"
2,ourtwotrees,"We bought this toaster after looking at reviews and assessing the quality thinking it was the correct choice. Were we ever wrong! We have yet to get a piece of toast which is not burned or under toasted. It has 8 settings and so far we have not used any setting past 4 as 4 will sometimes get the job done with minimal scorching. I can't see that the bagel setting does anything over and above the regular setting. We are extremely disappointed in this item. I am giving it 2 stars because it's such a good looking appliance and I'm hoping we got a ""dud."" Am sending it back and continuing to look for the elusive perfect toaster."
2,uneven toasting,"I have disappointed with the performance of this toaster. After weeks of research I purchased this to replace my 8 year old Cuisinart which had been discontinued. Six months later I have yet to get an evenly toasted piece of bread and have to continually adjust the settings. Unfortunately since I purchased it through Amazon's merchant online, I can't return it. Wish I'd gone with the Braun."
3,Disappointed,"I decided to ""invest"" in a better toaster as urged by my family. After researching reviews I chose an entry level Dualit. Now mid-April one side has popped out and the plastic frame has cracked. The two screws in the metal are for show only. I can only guess that it is an expansion problem. Very disappointed in the construction--it toasted well."
2,Disappointing for this price,"Toaster looks better but performs far worse than $15 ones I've had. In order to avoid having soft, untoasted sections, I have to char others. One side of the bread is always several shades darker than the other, making the darkness-preference knob meaningless. Also I have to leave the toast in the toaster for a couple of minutes after it's done or else it comes out charred *and* limp, almost like it's been in a steam bath. After a couple of minutes, it crisps up a little but by then its no longer hot enough for which to spread on natural peanut butter.ETA: This toaster set off my smoke detector while I had it set on level 4 today. The bread isn't even completely toasted, just singed badly on the edges."
1,Poor Quality for the Price,This Dualit toaster is very expensive. The Dualit toaster only lasted a year before the side screws broke free of the cheap plastic casing. We only operated this toaster once a week.I wrote to the company..... and they suggested I take it back to the store. (Who keeps a toaster reciept for a year)
1,toaster,"The toast is uneven, burnt on one end and underdone on the other.This is not a toaster I would recomend."
1,Don't buy it!,"If an item tends to have more good reviews than bad reviews I'm more likely to give it a shot. Pass this toaster by. The bottom of the bread gets significantly more brown than the top of the bread. To get it to toast evenly I have to flip the slices mid-toast. If this was a $30 toaster, fine, ok. But it is not. It is not worth your money."
2,Beautiful design but not so good in performance,"Bought this model from another source for the same price listed here. I have a friend that has the expensive 4 slice ""commercial"" toaster and have heard Dualit is the best so I bought this toaster. It is very difficult to even get the toaster to engage. The lever does not work well and it takes excessive force to get the bread to stay down. Determining the length of time for the toast to stay in the toaster is a crap shoot. I recommend the potential buy either pay the full price for the nore expensive model or buy something else. This model is a disappointment. :("
5,Excellent toaster,"This toaster works very well. It toasts very evenly if you toast 2 slices of bread. The instructions inform you that if you toast one slice of bread, the side facing the empty slot will be darker, since heat transfers from the empty slot. This is definitely true. The lift lever is a nice feature. If it is difficult to remove whatever you are toasting, you just lift up on the lever and it elevates the item for you to remove. The crumb tray is easy to empty without making a mess. The toaster is solid and very good quality. It also looks nice and goes well in a kitchen with black appliances."
2,Not High Polish,"I returned this item because it said it had a high polish finish - it did not. It has a flat black matte finish. Cannot comment on how the toaster performs, since I returned mine because it didn't match my other shiny black appliances."
3,Not free shipping,"This isn't a comment on the toaster itself, but about shipping. While the toaster is sold by Amazon and the listing indicates free shipping, when you check out a shipping charge is added. I called amazon customer service and was told this item doesn't qualify for free shipping. Add between $8 and $15 to the cost. FYI."
4,What's a boy to do?,"A frenetic, funny & memorable book of short stories about the life & times of Jeremy Theodore Grabowski, the summer the girl next door decides to liberate the women of the world & gets a crush on Jeremy; he gets noticed by the neighborhood bully & his parents think about re-locating to Arizona.Kevin Carlson's maps of Jeremy's street, yard & room & all his illustrations add delightful images to the crazy stories.This is one book you'll be reading under the covers in the brightness of your flashlight!"
2,I've listened to better flamenco,"I love very much flamenco music, as well as the Portuguese fado, but I have to say that I expected this CD to be better. It contains only 10 very short songs and compared to the other flamenco CD's I have at home, this one is not that good.It seems to be more commercial than traditional, something meant for people who are looking for combinations of ethnical and traditional things adapted to the modern standards.However it was an interesting experience and I dont think I will throw it away - Im sure I will listen to it from time to time."
4,old school style pre computers,"This is the third book of Murray Bovin that has been updated and revised. This is in the style of the old school text books from the 1930's to the late 70's. They cover much more of what was thought you should know than well you can get by without it. With this knowledge data base as they call it now you will be able to over come problems and work stoppages that cause other to give up in the art metal field and to move on to something else.The book has plenty of B&W; pictures, charts and working drawings. The plans bring back the warm and fuzzy memories of shop class from 9th grade thru high school. They are mostly in the art deco, and 50,60's style that is now much sort after. I own it I use it and I enjoyed reading it.This one is not for the have to have it at the end of the day crowd."
4,House session,"Great deep house grooves on this (2)CD collection,Classic garage It will make youwant to dance all night.This is a Djs must have."
1,This is not Styx,"The departure of DeYoung De-toothed this band. Styx was a rock band with an original sound. The original sound is gone, the rock is gone. This weak remnant of Styx is proof that DeYoung was more than just a talented vocalist, he was the heart of Styx. With the heart gone, the corpse is in decay. Boring, mundane, heartless, mild.As the poet said, a rose is a rose by any other name. Conversely, Calling a band Styx does not make it so..."
4,Cyclorama ~ Styx,"I thought, without Dennis DeYoung, Styx is nothing. All those live cd's which were pretty bad. Lawrence Gowan sings good on his own songs, but he sings terrible on Dennis DeYoung's songs. But okay, about this album, I like it very much. It doesn't sound like other Styx albums, but that doesn't matter, this is a good album. The songs of Tommy Shaw are very good. James Young's songs are good too, especially 'These are the Times'. But I think if Tommy would have sing on that song, it would be even better. I think that James Young should not sing anymore, he used to sing very good, but not anymore. Lawrence Gowan has written some nice songs and he plays the keyboard well. But he can't sing half as good as Dennis. The songs from Glen Burtnik are good as well.If you like the old Styx, then I can't say if you will like this. It is different from other Styx-albums."
3,Jim Emerges,"Let's cut to the chase...JY has the only artistic voice that emerges here. ""These Are the Times"" aptly represents a personage and time most of the reviewers I've read don't have an opportunity to understand. This is Jim's best work as a songwriter.The song is is an emotional salute to his brother. God bless.Lest we forget, it's all about reaching the listener."
5,Another great effort by a great band!,This CD has become one of my favorites right next to Shaw/Blades Hallucination. Obviously these guys have great chemistry and work well together. This CD is worth every penny that you pay for it!
1,File under: 'Where are they now?' catagory.,"You know the band is having an identity crisis when they are trying to sound like bands 1/3rd their age.This album blows. It might not be as bad as the horrid ""Brave New World"" but it's still craptacular.And you know they are grasping at staws when Billy Bob Thorton makes a guest appearance on the album.What flummoxes me is what, pray tell, the great Brian Wilson (of ""Pet Sounds""/""Smile"" fame) doing rubbing shoulders with Stynx?Inquiring minds want to know."
1,No Dennis DeYoung - No Styx,"This is a sad pathetic album. The musicianship is professional but the songs are just aweful!If you remove the brain from the body, what happens...I love Styx - This is not Styx."
4,No Dennis...But I Have To Say It Could Not Be Helped,"Styx is a rock band...that being said...Dennis simply did not want to write any more rock songs. That of course is his choice. Easy to understand...Yes it was wrong in the way Shaw and Young gave Dennis the boot, still, he needed to go...if you want to have the memories just listen to the Return To Paradise album...Now as for the songs on Cyclorama...top notch material except for a few duds (Kiss Your Ass Goodbye, Bourgeous Pig) and the numerous slams at Deyoung (unnecessary)"
3,These are the times .(for the New Styx).,Thank you for not putting out Grand Illusion Part 2.Thank you for being you.Carry on chaps.
1,BRING BACK DENNIS!,STYX WAS THE BEST GROUP OUT THERE!I WILL NEVER BUY A STYX ALBUM THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL....JUST MY OPINION...
1,Cyclorama (Music or comedy album?),"Got the new album today. Most of the songs are pretty good. Takes me back a few years. Sounds the Styx of old. I would recommend this album to all Styx fans. They could have left out the comedy tracks and played some more music. Who wants to listen to Billy Bob anyway. The comedy tracks must be inside jokes to the band. They should have stuck to music, thats what people pay for when they they buy a Styx album. Guess they are trying to keep up with younger acts."
1,Styx Cyclorama Yuck!,Save Your Money. This CD is not worth the money. There is maybe one or two good songs. Styx just isn't any good without Dennis DeYoung on lead vocals.
2,"Close, but no carrot.","Sorry to disagree with the review, but after hearing the 1st three songs from the Styx web site, the rest of the CD is very disappointing. Waiting for our time, These are the times and One with everything are very good! They remind you of Equinox and Grand Illusion. But the rest, Yuch!! They should be begging Dennis DeYoung to return and save them. L. Gowan.. I am sorry but he is just BAD, he cannot sing or write! When I saw other reviews and listened to the 3 songs, I was really looking forward to the rest of the CD. But now, I say Download the MP3's from styxworld.com, Don't spend your money on the rest and dream of a perfect world or a ""Brave new world"" where DDY was still part of Styx!!!"
1,Why???,"I really hope that they haven't release this.As a Styx fan for well over 20 years I found this album terribly disappointing. Tommy Shaw seems to lost all writing skills in these two Styx comebacks, which is strange since he made may good songs as a solo artist and Damn Yankees and Shaw/Blades member, but still I feel that ""On my way"" was the last decent song he have written.I was not too pleased with Brave New World, but at least it had some good moments, and Dennis DeYoung saved the album from total failure with his songs. No such luck this time, songs in this album are totally brainless and idealess mess, and the stupid talks included seems to confirm that they have declined back to childhood level again.This is very sad, since Return to paradise was extremely strong comeback and live album, but they totally failed to carry on after that."
2,Is That IT,"I can't believe after all the hype and anticipation for this album to come out, That this was the best they could do. The band members had mentioned prior to the release that this was a colaboration of all of the members. I thought there was more musical talent than this. Well, it is quite obvious that the current Styx lineup is suffering terribly over the absence of Dennis DeYoung. The music( guitars, keyboards, drums) sound nice, but the lyrics and the vocals leave much to be desired. I have been a Styx fan since 1974, and I believe that this is probably their weekest effort to date. A good analogy would be, if you were a carpenter and wanted to produce better work, you would not cut off your best hand. I think they goofed on this one. Good luck next time."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I find it pathetic that the remaining members of Styx (JY and Tommy) would stoop to this level. I really thought they would be above the personal attacks on Dennis (without whom the band would not even exist). Take Journey for example, however bitter they may be with each other they still have shown enough class since the departure (no pun intended) of Steve Perry to refrain from immature mud-slinging. The new guy is equally irritating, he sounds like a cross between Ronnie Lane and the mayor of munchkin land.JY and Tommy...why must you be such angry old men? Two stars for a few good songs is a stretch for this one."
1,A Lack of Class,"This has got to be the most tasteless piece of drivel ever created. It is hard to believe that 2 of the band members (Young and Shaw) were long-time members of the Original Styx group which entertained countless millions of fans during the 70s, 80s and early and mid nineties. This was a real class act when Dennis DeYoung was at the helm but I cannot find even one song on this CD that is not offensive to me."
1,A Complete Waste,"I am afraid that Classic Styx fans will find this CD distasteful in the extreme; filled with hostility and bitterness. Among the most blatant slaps in the face to former bandleader and hitmaker, Dennis DeYoung I list the following songs: Killing The Thing That You Love, Do Things My Way, Bourgeois Pig, Fooling Yourself, and Kiss Your Ass Goodbye.It is a sad commentary that the driving force of this album seems to be taking aim at their former mentor."
5,Start From Scratch,"If you can forget the comparisons to previous incarnations of this band, you'll find this may be the best classic rock effort in years. By anyone. Don't compare it to Styx of the seventies or bemoan the absence of DDY. Just listen and enjoy these incredible songs in the here and now. As far as I'm concerned, there's not a weak track here. Like several other reviewers, I'm partial to JY's These Are The Times...and Tommy Shaw's One With Everything, but everything else is first class as well. I applaud this band for creating something this diverse, creative and just plain amazing. Start from scratch and I think you'll love this CD for what it is. A new beginning for what is still a viable and exciting band...in the studio and on stage."
1,There are BETTER albums to buy,"Your chances of going into a CD store and picking a CD, totally by random, that is better than Cyclorama are VERY good. Painfully mediocre is a hard thing for me to say but, it's true. And when you understand that I bought this at the Styx/Kansas/John Waite concert you can understand how disappointed I was. And I bought the $30 autographed edition,too!I really wanted to sit back and enjoy this album. But it's not going to be a memorable CD and probably will be collecting dust in clearance bins very soon."
3,Styx! Back Again?,"As an avid styx fan, I don't know what to think of this new compilation of songs! I mean, I mean.... It starts off good with Do things my way, and Waiting for our time (classic styx sound), then the music gets weak to me cause they invite in other artists (some I've heard of, some I haven't). There are a few other good songs after the first two...These are the times, One with everything (more classic styx). Like some other previous Styx albums, it might just have to grow on me over time! This will not however convince me that the group has gone sour..."
3,Good...but not Styx,"I really don't mind when former members of a band get together to play music. The tunes may even be great, which they are here. The problem I have is when one or two members use a neme already associated with a five member band such as Styx. Maybe the band name could be YOUNG SHAW OR STYK."
2,where's dennis?,"i couldnt wait for the cd to be released, then when i finally got it, it was less than thrilled. i love tommy shaw, but i was hoping dennis deyoung would have made a contribution. the music is okay, but i think the cd is missing dennis' song writing ability. maybe i just need more listening time, but i dont like it right away."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I ONLY GOT A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO 30SECS OF THE FIRST 5 TRACKS. I'VE BEEN A STYX FOLLOWER AND FAN FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS. THIS ALBUM JUST ISNT UP TO STYX STANDARDS. YOU CAN TELL DENNIS ISN'T INVOLVED. I ENJOY ALL THE MEMBERS OF STYX PAST. EVEN GLEN WAS/IS A GOOD ADDITION SINCE HE FELL INTO THE GROUP SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHILE FILLING IN FOR TOMMY SHAW. THE NEW DRUMMER DID AN EXCELLENT JOB FILLING IN AFTER JOHNS PASSING, IN WHICH ALL STYX FANS MOURNED. IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL WHAT THE SONGS ARE ABOUT BECAUSE, WE CAN'T HEAR ALL THE LYRICS. FROM WHAT I GATHER, THESE FIRST FIVE SONGS ARE INTENDED TOWARDS DENNIS...THIS WILL BE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ALBUM FROM THE STYX ORGANIZATION."
1,Absolutely Horrid,"Oh my gosh, Tommy Shaw and JY have personally ruined what was once a great band. This album just grates on the ears. They miss Dennis DeYoung tremendously. The songs are uninspired, trite, and in too many occasions immature and tactless with their constant badgering of Dennis. Really uncalled for.Don't waste your money on this - thankfully not many Americans are as I notice it is down to 1685 on the Amazon chart. If you want good Styx buy Paradise, Cornerstone, or Grand Illusion. Or better yet, buy Dennis DeYoung solo."
3,Styx back with Cyclorama.,"People:Styx back, with a new CD studio record: Cyclorama.For the stygian fans is a new oportunity to refresh revival the new band. In the first time I look like listen a 70 decade CD Styx: more keyboards an chorus like Grand Illusion, but I yearn the voice of D. Young, for me,..... the voice of Styx!!.Very nice the lyrics and Yames Young and Tommy Shaw perfomance.Excelent drums and keyboards sets..In summary: for selective fans!!!.Enjoy It!!!"
5,Best Styx album in 20 years!,"This is the first Styx album that actually sounds like Styx since Kilroy Was Here. Instead of trying to re-invent themselves, Styx approached this album trying to sound like classic Styx, and they do! I actually heard several of these songs live before the album was released and I was immediately impressed. Dennis DeYoung's absense is only missed for sentimental reasons- Lawrence Gowan is a perfect replacement whose songs are much stronger than DDY's contributions on the last two albums (Brave New World and Edge of the Century). ""Kiss Your Ass"" is a fun anthem that I love to blast in my car. ""One With Everything"" is an ambitious nod to the seventies art-rock style of Grand Illusion, complete with moogy-sounding keyboard solo. ""Killing the One You Love"" is very moving. And I know it's cheesey, but I like the hidden tracks at the end."
5,Severly underrated!!,"A Styx album that is often bypassed!!I heard that sales for this album absolutely stunk. There's definately no reason for that. An amazing album for all lovers of progressive rock and AOR. If you like older Styx, this is right up your alley. It has everything a Styx lover would want, brilliant ballads, heavier songs, beautiful lyrics, and a typical Styx sounds that brings back memories of Paradise Theater.A very safe buy indeed..."
5,Long live Styx,"This new album was well worth the wait. I waited with anxious hope to see what this new line-up would produce. The great harmonies performed on this album are true blue Styx, and then some. ""These are the Times"" and Waiting for Our Time"" are classic Styx. ""Fields of the Brave"" is a great first Styx effort by Gowan. ""Kiss Your Ass Good-bye"" was quite amusing and great fun to listen too. The balad ""Yes I Can"" brought chills, Tommy and Glen's voices blend perfectly, like they are one and the same voice. I highly recommend you purchase this album!"
3,try looking forward...,"I really don't have a problem with Styx doing an album without Dennis Deyoung, however, Cyclorama ends up being a tribute to Deyoung. Nearly every song includes overtly or thinly veiled derogatory remarks aimed at Deyoung. This gets very tiring very quickly. Hopefully the next Deyoungless CD will actually find the band looking forward with a bit more optimism in their lyrics and a bit less vitriole directed at their ex-bandmate. There is some very good music here, so apparently Styx hasn't hit a creative wall, and maybe they've gotten all the Deyoung bashing out of their systems now. So, Styx, go ahead and make another concept album, but please leave Dennis out of it."
4,Improved my health and energy,"Not into self-diagnosis but I was having typical thyroid issues cold feet, very exhausted, brittle hair. This has really made a difference. Have new found energy no cold limbs at all. This product made a big difference in my health."
2,I haven't seen any difference,I don't know if it does anything. I'm not loosing weight but I'm not gaining either. Can't say that I would attribute it to the product.
3,Substitute table salt with this.,"Takes 2 stars off because dropper is made cheap. Plastic, bent and looks fragile. Also the liquid is not 100% clear. I'm not sure if all kelp extract looks like this but there are definitely some floating algae in there.Warning: some researcher found harmful amounts of arsenic in OTC kelp extracts. Not sure if this product is completely free of arsenic. Please do some research before you buy.Otherwise a cheap alternative to iodized-salt."
3,Buy the powder instead,When I bought the powder I went to A store called marlene's in Seattle and I found that the powder form was more reliable than whatever was in this bottle.when I received it.it was clear and smelled like old water from a used tire.6 months later it's off color and smells like kelp.I guess it had to age.idk
1,liqui-kelp,I did not like this at all. The product is like dirty water. How do I know that it is Kelp and not some dirt that some just says that it is kelp. It is gross and I wonder how sanitary it is to drink this. I can not comment on its effect since its too gross to drink and I won't. Wish I can return it but shipping is probably more than the refund. I would not recommend this.
2,Not Helpful!,"I bought these thinking that they would be a big time-saver. Yes, they saved me time from looking up meds and then hand-writing them on cards. However, when it came time to be quizzed by my instructor, I found myself fumbling through the information on the card.The layout of the cards makes it difficult to read when you're trying to answer questions quickly. Also, some of the information on the cards is not as clear and concise (Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses is soooo much better). The verbage ""too scientific"" and not in simple enough terms so that students can put into their own words the actions, contraindications, etc.Do yourself a favor and don't get these cards. You'll save yourself from fumbling and it's probably worth writing out your meds just for the sake of learning!"
3,Needs a bit of work,"The book starts out smoothly but as the chapters progress the bio/story line becomes a bit fragmented and choppy. Towards the end it seems more like a gossipy he-said she-said tabloid style pitch than a fact-based level headed story. He did reveal some very interesting info about the entrenched Olympic game culture and the extent of homophobia found in that industry and nationwide. Overall: Amusing at times, but the author (Mark Tewksbury) seems a bit flighty and indecisive, and is not the stalwart masculine rock of a man that I was hoping to read about."
4,Straight Up and Out Talk,"Mark Tewksbury is an inspiring person and a well-admired athlete of the Olympics. I'll be honest and say I was approaching this book from a shallow viewpoint. Though he was a swimmer, not a diver, it seemed like his ""coming out"" story would just be a pale comparison to that of Greg Louganis.This is not the case, however, as Mark's story is told with an elegance and difference that makes it stand alone. Do not expect high dramatics or shocking revelations, but there are well-learned lessons here and simply an amazing personal journey. It reminds us that each gay person's evolution is a unique story. What I most appreciated was that he dared to come forth with his relationship as part of a three-way couple, a theme that's unusual even in gay autobiographies.We've had the stories of Louganis, Billy Bean, and others, and this one joins the chorus in helping us recognize the special challenges that face the gay athlete in the coming-to-realize and coming-out processes."
3,"new low for the Olympics, Gay Games & OutGames","Mark did a fairly good job in destroying any respect I had for the people responsible for putting together the Olympics, GayGames and the newly formed OutGames. His story was quite interesting and for the most part well written. I don't know if it was his intention but I agonized over all the frustrating in-fighting at Olympics/Gay Games/OutGames that was depicted in graphic detail. I was saddened that our gay brothers and sisters could not come together and cause one games series for us. Mark did a great job making me feel the pain we all go through with the anti-gay bigotry. I also enjoyed the way he showed the upward progression of acceptance from the time he was a teen to his 30s. I applaud Mark for this contribution and recommend the book."
2,overpriced,"Killer CD that I bought awhile ago. To bad the interweb has it for cheaper to download. It's not like the CD has killer info or lyrics in the sleeve. But its a hard to find album, so it is what it is."
2,Talking Caller ID,"Works spradically - not dependable. Will not work with AC adapter, even though directions state that it will."
2,"Okay, but not great","I've had other ergonomic keyboards before from Adesso and really enjoyed them. This keyboard however is flat, which is not at all what I wanted. The function key support is alright, but sometimes malfunctions. As has been noted previously, the 6 key is on the wrong side of the keyboard. The software interface for the keyboard is patchy at best and does not always work well. The USB ports on the keyboard work okay as long as you're not plugging in external storage devices; for some reason, the devices have a nasty habit of disappearing from the desktop. About all that can be said is buyer beware, this may not be exactly what you think."
1,don't bother,"Buying this keyboard was a mistake. Yes, the keypads are separated, but flat isn't great if your wrists really need ergonomic. More annoying is the poor quality--one of the keys doesn't have a spring, meaning you lose quite a few letters while typing."
1,drivers don't work,"I bought this Adesso keyboard because I liked my old one so much. This is much flimsier, rocks when I type and WORST of all, the downloadable drivers do not work on my mac book pro (Mac 10.5.6). Every time I connect my laptop I have to re-identify the keyboard. I do not recommend you buy this."
4,Adesso ergonomic keyboard for Mac,I have been using the keyboard for about a month now with no problemsThe new mac keyboard is next to impossible for anyone with large hands to useOnce you try an ergonomic board you will never go back
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"As other reviews have pointed out, the choices for ""ergo""-shaped Mac OS keyboards are pretty sparse. I bought this keyboard in January 2005, and I don't think I'd buy it again. First of all, Adesso's support of the function keys (across the top) is pretty lame. I've had to bug them for updates, and even with the updates, a few of the function buttons don't work. Also, the key action isn't for me ... the keys are spongy-feeling, and the travel is too long. I also find that the keys bind if you hit them even slightly off-center, which I find rather annoying. But it's a matter of taste ... clearly some people like the action/feel of this keyboard. Someone mentioned that they don't care for the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, but I prefer it. Too bad it's only for Windows."
3,Adesso Intellimedia MediaPro,This is not a bad keyboard but I ended up returning it because for small hands it is difficult to span the split keys and it had a broken mail function key. Got the Microsoft Wireless Laser keyboard and mouse instead. I don't use the mouse but I like the keyboard a lot better.
3,Not that great,"I got this because typing makes my wrists ache. It's okay, but the keys are cheapish, and the layout isn't as nice as a Microsoft Natural, which is what I'm used to. I'd really prefer something more along those lines."
1,keyboard,"The keyboard does not perform what it says it does for Mac OS-X. The function keys do not work, yes I did install the software that came with the keyboard. Disappointed!"
2,NOT QUIET,"I bought this keyboard to use w/my Mac b/c of the great reviews and because it was SUPPOSED to be quiet. It's no more quiet than my regular keyboard. It doe have a lot of bells and whistles and looks to be a great board, but I'm returning it because it's NOT QUIET and that was the main reason for me replacing my current keyboard."
3,good enough ergo kb,"Setup was easy. Key action is nice and fairly quiet. USB ports are nice.I'm giving it three stars because I dislike the cd eject function being put onto the f12 key -- it's annoying to have my widgets pop up and I wish they would have given that function its own key as the Apple keyboard did. The power key _is_ fairly easy to hit accidentally if you try to pick the keyboard up. Another star-removing nit is that the ""6"" is on the wrong side of the keyboard split. I'm sure the designers did it for looks but it throws me when I'm typing my phone number. These are nits, though. Overall, it's a good enough ergo keyboard."
3,"Good keyboard, mostly","I bought this keyboard because it is compatible with my new iMac. I had a MS ""comfort"" keyboard before, and while it worked with my Mac, it lacked certain functionality inherent in Mac keyboards.Unfortunately, when I followed the instructions for installing the supplied software, as well as freshly-downloaded drivers, I ran into two problems:1. The media function keys don't work.2. I am unable to open the app to access the keyboard's functions.I am beginning to think the drivers for this keyboard weren't set up with the new Intel Core Duo iMacs in mind. I've contacted Tech Support, but have yet to hear from them.Nevertheless, the Mac keys still work (mostly), and it's the only ergonomic Mac keyboard I've found that doesn't cost a small fortune, so I will continue to use it. I just hope they come out with a driver that supports the Intel-based systems quickly."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this keyboard because it was the only reasonable priced ergonomic keyboard out there made especially for the Mac. Since I was switching from a PC it seemed important to have the correct keys (and not just use a Microsoft keyboard that was ""Mac compatible).The first keyboard I got didn't work. Plugged it in, fired it up and nothing. Had to send it back. Second keyboard worked, sort of. None of the function keys at the top work (volume, CD controls, etc.) and after two years of use my wife complains that she has to press extremely hard to get the keys to work (I haven't noticed this--either I use it all day and just got used to it, or I type harder than my wife).The only reason I haven't replaced it yet is because I can't find an ergonomic keyboard designed for the Mac that's under $100. I'm thinking about just going with a Mac compatible keyboard and dealing with the difference in Mac vs. PC keys."
3,50/50 shot at a good one,"This is the second keyboard of this type I had to order. The first one did not work well. I create marketing pieces for a large university. The ""I"" and ""P"" keys stuck and we had several print jobs that had to be reprinted or just weren't caught and had embarrassing mistakes go out. Unfortunately, this was the only ergonomic keyboard I could find for my system, so I had to get the same kind and hope for the best. This one (that I purchased from Amazon) does not have that sticking problem, so it has worked out well.Just a word of advice - if you purchase this keyboard, be sure to keep the original carton...just in case you have to send it back. I didn't keep mine, so I had to take a loss and just pay for a new one, rather than return the defective product."
3,Sound is not very good,My 2 year old son got this for Christmas last year and was initially very excited because he loves music. However the piano has a very tinny sound and doesn't even come close to a real piano sound. Also the stool and piano legs have to be tightened often and can come off quite easily.
