5,Oldie but goodie,This is one of my favorite all time movies. The robot really has a funny personality and the animation of the robot is great.
3,Short Circuit 2,"A fun adventure even though the slimy antagonist's overzealousness is carried a bit too far. Our copy had no subtitles, and the Near-East dialect of one of the primary characters was quite hard to understand at times. However, Johnny Five, the robot, is endearing and we enjoyed the action and even Johnny's near demise."
4,great movie! johnny five rocks! no extra features though...,"this is a great movie, i remember watching it as a kid in the early 90's. i had searched online for years trying to find it, and stumbled upon it here. i wanted the blu ray version. i wasn't expecting much as far as quality, i mean after all the movie was produced in 1987/1988.i was pleasantly surprised however, picture was crystal clear and sound was very crisp. overall a lot better than i expected. the only reason i didn't give this five stars was because there are NO special features. it's just the movie and subtitles.other than that, great movie for adults and kids alike!"
3,WARNING TO PARENTS - NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS!,"This film should be rated PG-13 due to the prolific swearing in nearly every scene. There were even a couple of sexual references. My 3 year old pulled this off the shelf at the rental store from the family section. He's seen the ads for the upcoming Walle movie and the robot on the cover of this DVD box has a similar look.While this film might appear at first glance to be a good candidate for family viewing - it isn't. Adult's who liked the first film will probably enjoy this sequel, but keep it out of reach of your young children, unless you'd like to expand their vocabulary!"
5,A gift for my son who is doing family history,This book is a gift. I know my son will be thrilled with it. Thanks for the fast service. Fantastic
1,Harvard University Press published this!,"All men are thoroughly reprehensible monsters, criminal psychopaths until they are rehabilitated by the love of a good woman. The author doesn't believe that gay people exist, but if you could convince him, he would no doubt suggest that gay men should be corralled into shot-gun marriages so they could be rehabiliated by the love of a good woman too.I can see the new constitutional amendment: all men, gay or straight, must get married to women by age 18, or go to prison. Or does the author believe that all men who are unmarried and over age 18 already are in prison?"
4,The Real Deal,"It brought back memories of great fun, ""real"" club music and an era of dance that combined the art of classical ballet & freestyle street/club dancing."
5,Not a HUGE underground fan,But wow - what an amazing documenatry on an era that would have been cool to be a part of. Good job. The old footage of NYC and Chicago and how everyone looked and acted was great. Was too young for this or the Studio 54 era/vibe but if i had to choose i would have been a part of this way before the other.
4,NYC old skool Clubbing!,"Few words to say ""DO you like Disco Music!? Do you like House Music!? DO you want to learn more the underground movement of the late 70ies and early 80ies in NYC!? BUY IT"""
3,Old School revisited,"For those who enjoyed the Garage in the day this is a must have. Just enough stuff on Larry and those who produced the milieu of that period. Will definitley make you want to do more research on the club and the time period. Hey, producers, what about 12West, Crisco Disco, the Loft, the Saint, Pyramid, etc. Places that made Studio 54 jealous..."
3,Interesting but Missing something,"Coming from Chicago, being a DJ, and who loves house and dance music, we always heard of Paradise Garage and Larry Levan, and of course, Frankie Knuckles, but this should have been called the Larry Levan story. I love the old footage from the club, and the information about other places like ""The Loft"". What is missing is what made all this clubs so special......THE MUSIC!!!!!! The movie started with ""Disco Circus"", but it had very few songs through out the piece to really take you back. They should have gotten at least some of the Salsoul collection movie the movie along. I wanted to love it, but it's ok."
5,Back in the day,Ramos does a great job of documenting the beginning of the underground Black gay club scene in New York City. For me it was nostalgic. Great footage and interviews. Kudos to Ramos for putting this project together on film.
1,No illustrations in this edition,"This seems to be the only hardcover edition, sadly, and we ordered it because of that. But it has none of the wonderful Harrison Cady illustrations. This review refers to the Aegypan press edition."
3,intriguing,"I enjoyed reading this book and finished it rather quickly. Genuine feelings and experiences from the authors about their own parenting journey. A little disappointed though about the topic of spanking. Though the authors emphasize their belief in this particular method should be limited and only with young children, it still gives the impression that it is preferred. I would also like to see more emphasis on parents' responsibilities and accountabilities in this difficult task of parenting. Overall, I appreciate this book and has recommended to others."
2,"Man, this hasn't aged well at all","Saw this again for the first time since 1983. I'm struck by how dated it feels. The hairstyles on the women are very Reagan-80s, all blow dried. The men don't fare much better. It's now a period piece. This was so big when it came out, and acquired a certain cache after awhile. But the soundtrack, innovative in its day, is very tired now, compared with all the copycats that have followed. I recently visited Beaufort, S.C., where this was filmed. They are still dining on it there, almost 30 years later. Watchable, but only to see how badly it's aged."
4,hmmm..,"While I get a kick out of watching younger versions of Glenn Close, Kevin Kline and JoBeth Williams, this movie just makes me feel OLD. Maybe that's because I AM old. Kind of dated plot, themes, music, etc. Nostalgic for some, but I didn't think Meg Tilly was as hot as the film thinks she is."
4,"enjoyable, but frankly my dear, id rather be in secaucus","i managed to miss this: one of those generational impact movies, and never caught up to it until now. it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were NOT cliches when this movie was released, but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all 8 stars. and of course there IS that soundtrack. still, the movie ripped off ""the return of the secaucus 7"", and tho i havent seen that in a long time, my guess is id prefer it on a more core level."
2,bunch of rich middle aged white people whining,"hey get real people, the worl isnt the way you want it? get over it. I am in my late thirties, going to night school, taking care of elderly relatives and worrying about the bills. Wish i was rich so i could whine about unfair life is"
5,Funny and love the soundtrack,"The ending is sort of, hmmmm, how would I say, ...... ""can do without it"" but the rest of the movie is fun and entertaining. Love the music, love the actors, just fun and I'd watch again and again."
4,Great movie,Arrived on time. I have wanted to add this movie to my collection for a long time. So glad I could.
5,A MOVIE WITH HEART,"This movie doesn't need special effects, a high budget, or a mainstream following to rank it as one of the best films of all time. It is a brilliant story of friendship, brought to life by solid, believable actors at the summit of their game. The score will take you away to a different time. The story will make you reminiscent and nostalgic of your own youth and your friendships. This is a movie everyone should see. Words are hard to describe its sweet pain of loss and life...MTS"
1,annoying subtitles could not be deleted,It was impossible to get rid of the very annoying subtitles. This is one of my favorite movies so I was very disappointed.i
4,How about a Special Edition Blue Ray release??,I thought this movie should get an upgrade on special features. How about a commentary with the cast or Kasdan?Deleted flashback scene that was to be at the end.A nice new transfer would be wonderful too. Do it for the fans.
5,My most favorite movie EVER!,"This video exemplifies life and relationships I experienced firsthand as a ""boomer""- Class of 1968. Included in this well directed flick are a great cast of talented actors illustrating extremely believable dynamics. And, no matter how many times I watch, my pleasure factor and interest have not diminished."
1,Highly Overrated,"Having heard rave reviews for this film, I watched it with high expectations. Unfortunately, about halfway through I was thoroughly bored, and two-thirds of the way through, I hit fast-forward. Other than cult stuff, I would rate this as the worst movie I have seen."
1,Yuppie scum sell out,"This movie, more or less, was the one that launched the boomer controlled media's obsession with the 60's and glorified that generation's selling out - moving from social activist, to self centred yuppie scum. Although sporting a good cast, this is one reprehensible movie."
2,The Mediocre Chill,"Although trying to have a very adult, sophisticated air, this movie is really about as sophmoric as The Breakfast Club, just with somewhat older babies. For a somewhat better take on the lost aspirations of one's youth, That Championship Season did a bit better job of it, if in an equally obvious manner.But at least The Big Chill IS about adults, made for an adult generation, something that just a few years later would rarely be seen out of Hollywood. And, what a cast!"
5,A BIG Chill!!,"I watched this movie last night for the second time. I had forgotten almost completely what It was about and as I watched it memories just kept comming back. This movie is so incredible!! Not only is the music fantastic, but they have the best assortment of actors! It was great! The Big Chill will always live on!"
3,The Big Chill was just okay.,"I saw this movie because a friend recommended it to me after we went through something similar to what happened in this movie. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. It could be because it failed to portray the situation the way I experienced it in real life, but I just didn't really care for the movie. So, it gets 3 stars from me. Others may like it more, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from renting it if they want to... but for me, it was just okay."
3,"Too much talk, not enough action.","It took me 20 yrs. to finally get around to seeing this movie. Frankly, much of it was lost on me (though I did think Tom Berenger/Sam's Weber's attempt to jump into the seat of his convertible was hilarious). It seemed that at least two thirds of the action of this movie was the characters sitting around sipping white wine, smoking pot, listening to oldies, and lamenting their friend's passing and their own slowly dissipating lives. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that I'm Generation X; I may have held a deeper appreciation for this movie if i were a Baby Boomer."
4,Brings back the memories of old college friends,"This is a movie for anyone who has returned to a college reunion or a funeral and went to college in the 60's. The ideals of the 60's have been replaced with jobs, mortgages, broken relationships and children. The reality is most are living a life of yuppie affluence and out grubbing for money. Their parents were right, study hard, get a good job, marry someone with a future. I don't recall the movie depicting anyone who went to college and really didn't make it afterwards."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:The fact that The Big Chill takes itself seriously doesn't mean you should: this is a slow-moving drama about college buddies reuniting after one of them dies which features the requisite drama and tears but never manages to be terribly interesting.
3,"Good tunes, but....","When I first saw this, I liked the movie but I still went away kind of disappointed. Guess the reaction to the story, such as it is, would be: Heck is THIS all we amounted to? This was what 1968 was for?Alas, in many cases that is true. The Pres has since confirmed just that."
2,"Skip this, and watch...","... John Sayles's ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" instead. As usual, the small-budget independent film puts the Hollywood product to shame."
1,The Big Zero,"I had heard so much about this movie over the years. Watched it finally and could not believe how bad it was. What a total waste of film and time. Was there even a script, or a production person that wasn't obviously stoned out of his/her mind, to this month old rotting hamburger helper movie, someone forget to bury?"
1,My boyfriend and I walked out when it was on at the Theatre,"So many years later, I decided to give it another try. It was worse than I remembered. If you enjoy watching a bunch of boring losers sit around and whine, you will love it."
1,What a poor excuse for a movie...,"I had heard so much about this movie, all good, that I looked forward to watching it. It was awful. What a waste of 1 3/4 hours! I know a lot of people love it, but it was not my ""cup of tea."""
4,A strong ensemble cast,"Everyone in the cast does a good job in this film, particularly Kevin Kline and Glenn Close as the couple who host a group of old friends for several nights after the death of another friend. I had seen it years ago, then just again today and, though one might hear some whining now and then, it's not irritating.The only thing I find intrusive on occasion is the soundtrack, which has great songs but tends to interrupt the narrative instead of to advance it."
5,Should be 12 star rating!!,"i just love, love, love this movie...the soundtrack and all!! Can watch it many times!! I saw this movie when it first came out in the 80's...and continued to watch it over the years, and it still moves me."
4,SOMEONE IS MISSING,"Second film of director Lawrence Kasdan, THE BIG CHILL could have been a confidential movie reserved to the 1970 american college educated generation. Fortunately a great cinematography and 8 outstanding actors have put some universality in Kasdan's screenplay.I saw THE BIG CHILL in the theaters in 1983 and what has stayed in my memory from this film is its first scene : the preparation of Alex dead body for the funeral. With a 1970 musical score. Really haunting.Most of the picture has very well passed the test of time except maybe for Sarah's amical sacrifice of her husband's fidelity. A little bit ridiculous in my opinion.Bonus features consist in a documentary with interviews of the director, the cast and the editor as well as SILVERADO's theatrical trailer.A wish you were here DVD."
2,"Good acting, lousy script","Self-indulgent boomers miss being irresponsible teenagers. Poor babies. Well, they get to pretend for one more weekend and we get to watch. Wonderful.I weep for the present."
3,A blast from the past,I am sure this was a big movie in 1983. I enjoyed the movie but you could tell the age.
4,Clear and Precise,This book was written for the inexperienced Christian who lacks understanding of soul ties. Thank you for clarity on this subject based upon scriptures.
4,Understanding Our Emotions,"When you truly understand why you feel attached or pulled back into a relationship that is not good for you, you work harder to make sure that it doesn't happen again. Breaking all soul-ties is getting rid of the bondage and the weight that holds us back from our true purpose in life. Awesome reading material!"
4,Answers to negative results,"I found this book to be very helpful in dealing with mental, emotional, spiritual and physical bondages. Some parts I did not agree with, but most of the book is very informative. I have shared this book with several students."
4,A new world is coming,"Great story. I have this in Italian and the English original version. Great story. Very simple but well done and the characters are designed with psychological accuracy. Reading this I forget problems, I enter in a new world and this is the magia of Hamilton. When you are reading you are in the world of the writer. Excellent literature."
2,Never really worked,"This thermometer is a great concept, however, it never worked. I replaced the battery, but that didn't help. It turned on and looked at though it was going to take a temp and then...nothing. My 3 and 5 year olds did not like how it sat in their mouth."
3,It's okay,"you child or you still has to hold the thermometer in place to get an accurate temperature reading, but it is easier than some of the other oral thermometers."
5,It a great thermometer,It the best thermometer I ever had work great for my child its very easy to use and read wish I could buy as a gift for my friends it hard to find but I thank I GOD that I Have one I give it 5 stars for sure Timex Please made more
4,Good Deal,"This is one of the most convenient thermometers I have ever used. They are no longer available in stores, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon..."
2,Bridge on the river kwai review,"We brought this film as we are going on a holiday to Thailand at the end of the year. We began researching Thailands history and came across this movie in an internet search one day, so we came to amazon and purchased it!It's a story that kept us interested for most of the movie. Towards the end it drags out a little bit, to the point where we actually had a conversation instead of watching it. Overall I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5."
2,"ZZZZZZ, ZZZZZZZ, ZZZZZZ. TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER!","THE DULLEST MOVIE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! The plot development takes forever, and the climax is just as slow. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE... if you want a good movie, then watch ""The Great Escape"". That's a good movie!"
1,"""A benchmark for war films"" ? I hardly think so!",How Amazon could rate this as a benchmark is beyond my understanding. This movie is so far removed from the reality of the episode that it is an insult to the troops who endured the events. Perhaps it would be best if Amazon relied on combat veterans to critique war movies.
4,"A very good movie, especially for its time.","This movie is definately above the curb of the average fifties film. The acting was simply incredible, Guiness giving one of his best performances short of ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The cinematogrophy is typical sweeping David Lean style. The end is simply one of the best I've ever seen in a movie; the camra pulling away to view the whole vista, the doctor simply stating: ""Madness. Absolute madness!"""
5,My Favorite Film.. Where's the DVD?,"This is my favorite film, and I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD. The film is amazing because the story is so powerful and consuming. Four fascinating, well-acted characters drive the film until all elements become one with the incredible climax, one of the finest filmed sequences in the history of film. The major film element here is actually irony. Characters act in a manner that wouldn't be predictable, yet the director weaves a picture where it still makes sense and upon reflection seems appropriate. Holden, Guiness, Hayakawa, and Hawkins all deliver complex, multi-faceted performances. Guiness delivers one of the finest performances in film history. David Lean should be a household name as is Hitchcock and Spielberg. Incredible! The vhs widescreen edition is of very high quality."
5,Smashing success...,I found this movie to be excellent produced and the charaters played by the actors came to live on the screen. This was a movie about tradgic times and places. The senior man in the prisoner of war camp was given the opportunity to work with his capturers and make it possible to give his men a means of surviving the war with dignity and purpose.
5,Tremendous War Film,"One of the best films ever made. Very few war films before or since that have come close to River Kwai. Kwai was one of the first films to show war in a negative view. I would not go as far as saying the film was anti-war, it was more realistic about what war does to men then other films of its day. Alec Guinness gives a tremendous performance (worthy of Oscar he received) as the British officer in charge off the POWs. William Holden gives one of best performances of his carrier as an American solder. By far my favorite film from Director David Lean"
4,MOVIE,"Ordered this movie and it downloaded without any mishap. I watched it all the way through and it played great. No complaints. I don't have a DVD to keep, but then I hope I have my hard drive backed up."
5,One of the very best.,"If you are a WWII buff, this one is a must for your collection. A plus is that the acting is supurb!"
4,4 Stars,"The movie is an excellent adaptation but can't quite match the mastery of the original novel. It has an all-star cast. The cinematography is fine as is the pacing. If it lacks anything, its the depth of the novel, which is a common failing in film adaptions. I recommend it for war and drama buffs alike."
5,Bridge on the River Kwai,An excellent portrayal of life in a Japanese prison camp. This was so well done that the exceptional quality of the filming shines out over some of the films created today.
5,Great Performances All Around,"From the Colonel Bogey March at the beginning to the last ""Madness"" at the end, this movie is a lot of fun. Alec Guinness is outstanding as the British officer obsessed with soldierly pride who realizes the depth of his obsession just a tad too late. William Holden is also great as the grunt-posing-as-office who is part of the mission to find the bridge of the title, though I think Jack Hawkins steals the show from him in their scenes together. Get the film. You will enjoy it."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time,"It got 7 Oscars in 1957. It is based on a real story. The song glues to your mind. And the 2 set DVD has nice extras that add to your admiration of this title. It is not the state of the art in restoration terms, but it won't let you down, abolutely. The story is well above any scratch you might see. It makes the battle between two cultures greater than any battle on the war."
4,A Bridge over time,"As a 23 year old, it is hard to understand all of the hype that surrounded The Bridge Over The River Kwai. From what I understand, the scene where the bridge is blown up was one of the most dramatic special effects of its day. In this era of computer animation and digital enhancement, this is hard to imagine.Evaluated in the context of its time, this movie is no doubt a classic. The acting, the direction and the cinematography are all first rate. The whole production is based on the true story of the American POW's who were held in a camp and forced to build the infamous bridge. I am guessing for all of its acclaim, it is very close to the actual events that happened.Everything on the DVD is good. My only beef is with the chapter selections, there are not enough of them. You find yourself having to fast forward through chapters to get to a specific point. Other than this small issue, this is a DVD worth adding to your collection."
3,"Good Hollywood Movie, But Check Out the Documentary","Just a quick comment: There is an outstanding documentary titled, ""The True Story of the Bridges on the River Kwai"". The real deal was a horror story, involving torture, cruelty, starvation, and atrocities. The Bataan Death March was a lesser WWII footnote by comparison. Many of the Japanese involved were tried at the end of the war and hanged for war crimes.The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai (History Channel)"
2,This made me think of renting Bataan (1943) with Desi Arnaz.,"I will watch just about any movie with William Holden in it and I have been curious to see the much hyped The Bridge On The River Kwai. Well, I was disappointed and was very bored by the film. It made me think of renting Bataan (1943) with a young Desi Arnaz. Not many bonuses in this DVD. I do like the computer special effects in ""Main Menu"" and the selection to show a frame of the rain during ""subtitles selection"". I love the sound of rain. Idea: Some company should make a DVD of two hours of rain."
1,Don't bother wirh the BluRay version,"I bought this movie on BluRay thinking it was a remastered version, but alas, it looks like they just took the DVD and wrote it onto a different format with no visual improvement. What a disappointment! The quality is NOT BluRay. I bought Patton on BluRay and Wow! I was blown away by the difference from my older DVD format. I will send this back and wait until they do it right, and will look more closely at the fine print before assuming BluRay means better video quality. How absurd."
2,What a Disappointment.,"I am a big fan of David Lean's films, and the idea of having The Bridge on the River Kwai on a fully realized Blu Ray thrilled me. And then I got this disc.The movie, of course, is wonderful. The picture, while more than okay was less than startlingly lovely. But the BIG disappointment was the sound -- here remixed into 5.1 channels of compression-free Dolby Digital.General sound quality, too, was okay. Until, about 20 minutes in, when my speakers started to spit out occasional (say every five minutes) ear-splitting 'cracks"" -- the type that long experience tells me can blow a tweeter.My system has the sound decoded by the Blu Ray Player - a Pioneer BDP-320 -- which then goes to an Onkyo 606 receiver.Never before (not since)has my system reacted this way to a visually perfect disc.Anyhow, back the disc went to Amazon. The disappointment remains."
4,Great Flick,"Again it was wonderfully acted. Had superior actors, that few today can match. It made one feel for the characters and what they were doing."
4,The Bridge on the River Kwai,You should show processing and handling fees on to price of item before it is tobe purchased. For future purchases of movies I would want the DVD format to bein full screen not wide screen.
5,"Why is word ""Barbarians"" edited out of blu-ray","I'm a long time fan of this film so it was only natural to want to add the blu-ray to my collection. Impressive boxed set and picture quality. But what I am not impressed with is their editing out the word ""barbarians"" in one of the films most memorable lines ""We'll teach these barbarians a lesson in western efficiency."" What gives? If their going to alter the film in such ways it should come with a disclaimer. I was going to donate my dvd copy but I think I'll keep it now."
3,Video is Good; Audio Not so Good,"I have returned two copies of this BluRay due to loud clicks and pops in the audio track. The video is more than acceptable although not ""stunning"", but the DTS audio is surprisingly defective. This was the case on two different top of the line Pioneer Elite BluRay players. I would not recommend this purchase until a new pressing is available."
3,What have I done?,"This motion picture, like most war films is fictitous. The building of a bridge over the river Kwai presented a group of captured British soldiers merrily working on this project. Notice none of them seem overly concerned that they are p-o-w's. Bill Holden, freshly shaved and tanned does his bit. Not all that good."
4,Among Lean's best,"While not as grand as 'Lawrence of Arabia' in its depiction, it is definitely among David Lean's best movies. Lean takes enough time developing the characters and plot, and presents a very satisfying movie with (what's most amazing to me in most of Lean's movies) a grand climax achieved with precision but without the use of CGI."
5,The Bridge Over The River Kwai,Great W.W.2 movie. With William Holden a great actor. I sure do miss him. He puts these new actors to shame. Good movie for any war buff to add to his or hers collection.
3,The Two Babylons,"Written originally in the mid 1800's this is a very difficult text to read--somewhat at the level of a King James Bible. The content is quite important, however the reader will need a great deal of patience to muddle through the language barrier of the past 150 years."
4,"Very interesting, thought provoking.","THE TWO BABYLONS, or the Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife.While I've only been able to give this a skimming right now, it's very interesting, especially since I USED TO BE Catholic and was having ""issues"" with the church for a long time. Good read for everyone interested in religious doctrine and practices."
1,Sloppy reasoning and faulty conclusions of an axe-grinder,"Hislop's work commits a fallacy which says that superficial similarities between two religions means that one borrowed from the other. His fanciful history is mostly from Hislop's own imagination and he often misquotes his sources. He says that candles in worship are used by a false Church which follows Bablon's mystery religion, but in scripture, both Old and New Testaments, we find the use of candles by God's people and in the heavenly worship. He objects to the tonsure of religious orders ignoring the fact that St. Paul in the book of Acts shaved his head as a sign of a vow he made to God. Space prevents me from listing all of the errors in his work. Interestingly, a popular updated work based on Hislop's book called ""Babylon Mystery Religion"" has been discontinued by its own author at a financial loss because its author was honest enough to admit that upon further research, he had to reject Hislop's contrived fantasies."
5,excellent referal,"""Hislops book, The Two Babylons, would be a valuable addition toyour library"".Dr. J. Vernon McGeeThru The Bible Radio"
5,"Hislop provides details of the origin of many ""Christian?""","Don't let the title disuade you. Where did the various holidays, icons, symbols and beliefs originate. Many Christians have no idea where their beliefs originated and how these many ""Pagan""rituals became adopted by the church. Why do we worship an evergreen tree at christmas? Who's birthday is really being worshipped? What about the rabbit at Easter, birthday cakes, rings and crosses? Such pain staking details provide the reader of the actual Pagan origins of Christian's holyest beliefs. See for yourself and be astounded"
1,Heresy,"This book is pure anti-Catholic heresy and should not be in the Catholic section. It is filled with false analogies and fabricated theories which any first year catechumen can easily disprove with Catholic Tradition and Scripture. It was and is still used by those who seek the destruction of The One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.Pax Christi"
1,"""Roswell"" for Anti-Catholics","There are many honest historical (and modern) quarrels one can have with the Catholic Church. They don't excuse savage bigotry such as this. A challenge for the positive reviewers below: do what I did - go to a well-stocked protestant theological seminary's library (for me it was Garrett in Evanston, IL and Trinity Evangelical in Deerfield, IL) and cite-check some of those impressive footnotes (and get ready for that feeling of betrayal - but at least it confirms the honest impulse within you)."
4,Things Are Often Not What They Seem,"Majoring in the substance of the Puritan case against the papacy, this book is upsetting to Romanists, but remarkably enlightening to the serious church history scholar.It is not particularly easy reading, but the content is solid and well documented."
2,Hard reading,"This book is a hard read. It's old and written in old language/style. He also seems to repeat things over & over, just in a different way. I started skipping sections and then just gave up on reading it. I hear others referencing information in the book, so thought I'd like to get it. Most of the stuff mentioned is repeating over & over about Nimrod's wife & son and then the Catholic church."
3,Archaic but important synthesis of information,"Hislop's analysis of the convergence of church history, archeology, and paganism provides a helpful synthesis of information rating five stars. Three complaints. First, the language in both diction and sentence structure is quite archaic making it a bit of a challenge to read initially. Second, Hislop's anti-Catholic bias does distract occasionally times. Finally, the print is miniscule; it's not a book for those with poor vision. Overall, it is a enlightening but slow read."
1,Lunatic Fringe,This book is for the lunatic fringe. No doubt they still believe the earth if flat! This book is propaganda not history. It simply confirms the prejudice of the simple-minded.
1,This book should come with a warning. . .,". . .CAUTION! CONTAINS HATE SPEECH! (But I suspect that will never happen.Noted historian Arthur Schlesinger, Sr has stated that anti-Catholicism is America's ""deepest bias"". Nowhere is this bias made more evident (or more absurd) than in this ridiculous book.As a non-Roman Catholic historian and theologian, I am deeply saddened that those who hate the Catholic faith cannot manage to disagree like Christians, but rather, must resort to anti-historical, anti-theological, anti-biblical, and frankly, anti-Christian hysteria.Give this book ""0"" stars -- and give it a miss (unless you are a collector of the worst that 19th century nativism has to offer.)"
1,Utter garbage,"Blatant falsehoods about Catholic belief and practice aren't enough. Blatant falsehoods about pagan belief and practice aren't enough, either. No, Hislop has to tie it all up with a profoundly illogical thesis, which is that if enough similarities can be found (or contrived, or simply invented) between ancient thing A and modern thing B, modern thing B must have developed from thing A. Clearly, if I'm a writer, my name is William, and I hang a javelin over my fireplace, I must be descended from William Shakespeare, right? Hardly. This isn't history. It's a fraud. Read Woodrow's ""Babylon Connection"" for more."
4,First Second-hand book,"It will probably not be my last. I did not expect mint, though ""collectable"" would lean that way. I would like to know if there is sun damage, prior to the purchase. Other wise very well."
1,Rubbish,"Everyone should read Ralph Woodrow's book ""The Babylon Conection?"" to see how flawed Alexander Hislop's research is. Hislop's book is rubbish and is fuel for anti-Christians to attack all Christianity not just the Catholic Church. Many of his sources and footnotes just don't check out. One star is too generous."
1,Rubbish!,"One star is much too much for this. It should be below zero. This is one of those ""I can't believe anyone would buy this"" kind of things. Don't. If you just can't stand not knowing what it says, its on the internet and you can save yourself some money. It is basically 19th century anti-Catholic propaganda. I am sure that it has as much to do with paranoia and predjudice concerning Catholics in England and Ireland and any study of Babylonian influences. The author gives himself away in this regard.The suggestion that the Druids were the recipients of Babylonian religion is just downright absurd. And I'll bet Native Americans would be interested to know that the Buffalo Dance is really a Satyr Dance from mediteranian paganism somehow transplanted??? Because they both use horned headgear?????This is just really baaaad. It would be laughable except for the glowing reviews of some others here. Now that is scary."
1,Garbage cloaked as history,"This is a book for bigots and the ignorant. There is nothing in this trash that cannot be disproven by any decent secular historian. Protestant scholars and people of honor have come out against the distortions and out right lies writtten and read by people of narrowor little intellect. Turgid and mind numbing in belongs right along side ""Mein Kampf"" and ""The Protocols of Zion.""Stupidity at its worst."
1,Why is this book listed under Catholic books?,I would recommend that you read Signs of Life: 40 Catholic Customs and Their Biblical RootsSigns of Life: 40 Catholic Customs and Their Biblical Rootsand/or Rome Sweet Home: Our Journey to CatholicismRome Sweet Home: Our Journey to Catholicism. Both books are written by a former Presbyterian minister and theologian with years of ministry experience in congregations of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The books are easily understood and avoid casting aspersions on other churches.
1,Unreliable!!!,"One author, Ralph Woodrow, who used Hislop's material actually had the sense to check it out for himself. To his astonishment, he found out it was full of errors - top to bottom. People who thrive after material like this would probably long for the writings of David Duke and Louis Farrakhahn as well. Time to grow up people!"
1,this is not the film SINFONIA DÁMORE,The picture of this VHS is wrong. This is not SINFONIA D'AMORE with the baritone Gino Bechi.I was looking for this movie but difficult to find.
4,Juan Diego: Messenger of Guadalupe,"I buy this movie for my grand kids 6 and 8 years they love it, very good messages for all of us,we really enjoy it"
3,Get great color and easy application but wasn't waterproof for me,"Beautiful color, easy glide-on, but for me, the eyeliner did not stay put as I had hoped after reading the other reviews. I know I can be hard on eye makeup, and believe it or not the NYC waterproof liner stays on the best and it is the cheapest."
2,all-over-the-place(s like this) Erratic is the word,"I had heard of this band before but never took too much interest... I recently bought a CD lot on Ebay and this CD was on there... The potential is there, but I was very put off buy the blatant mess these guys are making... changing things up every 20 seconds, using all kinds of instruments (ALL OF THEM)! changing melodies, vocals, everything! The songs aren't memorable at all and end up being much more annoying than pleasurable. I came on here to see how liked this album was by their fans and apparently most people agree that this album is erratic when compared to the bands previous releases. So I will definitely give them a chance and check out those albums because, as I said, the potential is very evident!"
2,Disappointment,"This cd was a huge letdown. AIH's prior two cds were both amazing. Its odd for an artist to drop in quality this drastically in the space of one cd... The single Heart it Races, was the only song I enjoyed. The majority of the tracks feature the male singer's voice and omit the beautiful harmonies from incorporating a female voice. This album sounds angrier and lacks the fun/easy-going feeling of their other cds. If you're a fan of Architecture in Helsinki, download Heart it Races and skip this album. I hope their next cd is better."
3,Erratic,"More ""serious"" album. Not as much fun as the first album. Still some good ideas in here, and a few excellent songs."
2,"Screechy, out of tune schlock rock","Reminds me of Scissor Sisters. ""Debbie"" is a fun song, but that's about all I could stand. I can see a lot of people enjoying this type of manic, desultory rock. Architecture in Helsinki is certainly inventive, but what they invent does not appeal to me. The vocals are screechy and out of tune, the arrangements are maddeningly often out of sync - I'm sure intentionally, and the electronic noise makes me feel like I'm in a bad nintendo game. As I said, there will be many who love this stuff. Good for them! You can have my copy."
5,jazz guitar of the highest order,"""Portraits of Duke Ellington"" is a phenomenal disc! This is jazz guitar of the highest order. The tone, the intellect, the soul, the technical proficiency, the elegance -it's all here. While I've probably listened to this tribute about a thousand times, it is as fresh as ever. ""Portraits of Duke Ellington"" is one of those rare recordings that stands alone for active listening or can melt into the background when necessary. While 'Caravan' is perhaps my favorite song, it is the album's elegantly somber tone that most resonates. Given the seemingly little fanfare for this CD, it's an unappreciated gem. There are no unnecessary notes on this disc; when it comes to jazz guitar, this album is gilt-edged."
5,F_ckin' Grawesome.,F_ckin' grawesome. Great and awesome. Grawesome. Deeee-lectable to the fullest. Sit down and have a listen...papa Joe hits the nail on the head.
4,Samla Mammas Mana - Totally Unique Stuff,"How does one describe the music of Samla? That is a difficult question. The obvious comparison would probably be Frank Zappa, but these guys really have their own sound that owes nothing to anyone else. Everything is done with a sense of humor that permeates this entire disc. I have come a bit late to the Samla camp and this is the only album that I own. The disc is comprised of both live and studio material at least some of which is improvised. I really don't have anything else like this in my collection. The instrumental work here is superb. The vocals leave something to be desired, but then again they are not really meant to be taken seriously. A narrator of sorts ads some humorous asides throughout the disc and the music is often manic in its approach and style. This album is not something that I pull out very often and it had to grow on me a bit, but there is no doubt these guys are totally unique and worth checking out if you like more adventurous prog."
4,Jesper's side of the war,"I thought this book was okay but I didn't go crazy for it. It should have been based on a real person so you would actually know what the people felt like, for real. The book didn't seem real enough."
3,Grilling tool set,The utensils are good. The clasps that hold the top and bottom of the grill basket together do not do a good job of keeping it closed tightly.
1,Don't waste your money,I specifically bought this because it was industrial. Plastic is not industrial. Drilling the hole for the lock I was installing I was waiting for the jig to break. Then when I went to drill the hole for the bolt the flange did not fit the 1 inch bit.If you do order this product get a magnifying glass because the instructions are in impossibly small print.
5,Irwin Door Lock Set,Super product A must have if your doors haven't been bored for keyed entry and deadbolts.What a quick and easy way. Love It
1,useless,"I almost ruined my door using this jig. It is very unstable and doesn't allow you to see if your hole saw is tilted or straight. The hole saws are also very quick to dull,(about 5 seconds). I have had much better results with the tape on templates. Save your money"
4,A different Duke than I'd ever heard before,"Have you ever heard Duke sing? Well, once you do (on only one piece) you'll understand why he stuck with composing, playing piano an leading the band. However, this recording is unique and has lots of great music to offer. It is thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Cream O' The Crop!,"Pendulum is to DnB, what Metallica is to Rock...Overlords! These guys are at the top of the list, AND on top of their game! I've been a fan of theirs for a couple of years and this is the best I've even heard them (of course, these are some of their best hits). Nice compilation...if you're looking to get into DnB...this is a good start...and finish!"
5,awesome album,just found out about thsi group....its amazing how uk music takes a long time to blow up in the us
2,Tarantula and Slam are the only ones worth your time,"Tarantula and Slam are basically the only songs you need to hear here. All the others (especially the overrated title track ""Hold Your Colour"") are not nearly as exciting as they are. Skip this one, skip ""Jungle Sound Gold"" and skip ""In Silico"". Pendulum needs to release more ""Tarantula""-esque songs or I'll stop coming back again and again."
1,Garbage on a CD,"This compilation of second rate Cuban music was apparently made to capture the dollars of those not familiar with quality Cuban music. In the whole collection there are probably one or two decent songs, with the rest being next to pure garbage.Don't waste your money."
5,Great Salt Grinder,"I like the easy adjustment from fine to coarse. Easy to handle, comfortable in hand. I also bought the pepper mill and am equally pleased with it as well."
5,Love this pillow,"What a great pillow. I had been complaining for quite some time about soreness in my left shoulder when I woke up. My chiropractor recommended this pillow. The price scared me at first but the pain grew worse and I went for it. Within two nights the pain was all but gone, and now after several weeks of using the pillow, I can't imagine how I ever slept without it.Note - An odor was evident at first, but like my shoulder pain, it was gone after a few days."
3,Just Didn't Hold My Interest,"Clever, but for some reason the writing style of the authors just didn't keep my mind engaged. Wonderful story, but I just found it a dull read despite the clever and unusual packaging of the topic."
3,In response to an ignorant pig,In response to the first reviewer. Why does he assume that Eugene Robinson got his job by Affirmative Action? How can he assume that White people have no Black Blood in them? Look at the descendants of Thomas Jefferson. He seems to be bitter about Affirmative Action programs.If we did away with people like him there would be no need for Affirmative Action programs.No one would assume people of color to be incompetent.The majority of his review is about quotas. Not about the book. I hope he gets some counseling. I think he needs a hug.
4,A personal story and a quietly intelligent book,"I read the book immediately after hearing Robinson on NPR's ""Diane Rehm"" show and found it one of the most quietly intelligent books I have read on the subject of race and color. Having been to Brazil recently (and speaking some Portuguese), I was eager to see how he analyzed the socio-racial scene there. This book is not a sociological tract--it is a highly personal book, the story of the author's own odyssey through his personal history and the various societies in which he has lived. By thinking about Brazil, he really does see issues of American society and history in a much clearer light--and helps us see them too. There are a string of revelations here. I would want to argue with him about some of his conclusions, but I thought Robinson came through as a man of great integrity who has put a lot of himself on the line here. I recommend the book highly."
2,worked for me,"product worked as advertised, would buy again. don't know much else to say, it's a power adapter.if you need it...buy it"
1,Loose Fit,I have never had a problem with a cord not fitting well into an outlet - but it is way too loose! It keeps falling out and I have to buy a new one.
1,Not Good Quality,The quality of this product is very bad because it broke now it is not useful for me. Today I ordered from different company/member from Amazon. Hope this quality will be good.
5,Works fine - good quality,Non polarized (same shape both sides). Good - works - it should - its a simple cord.
1,Shoddy,The plug doesn't quite fit into a regular socket. It's a little loose and will simply fall out unless you bend the connectors outwards.
5,fits my HP printer,"Lost my power cord to my old HP printer. Was worried this wouldn't fit, but it is perfect, just like the original. Good quality and arrived sooner than expected. Best price I could find on the net."
5,Just what I needed!,This is a universal cord that I used to replace one broken for my Technic electric piano. Item arrived in new condition & works great. Shipped quick too. Thanks!
5,"good price, fast shipping",the total came out to 5 dollars for my purchase. i couldn't find this item on its own anywhere. i would've had to buy an ac converter too for a ridiculous price. this items works just fine. the shipping was fast. totally worth the total price.
1,Substandard product,"The cable is skinny and no mark to indicate the wire gauge or any standard body approval. However mark on the male head indicate 250V 6A, which obviously mismatch with the cable capacity. Furthermore, the male metal prongs thickness is so much less than the standard US plugs and cannot stay in the wall socket. It falls off from wall socket very easily."
1,Poor Quality,"Beware of the cheap price. Product is cheap quality. After two weeks both ends of the cord had splitting on the outer sheath, which exposed the inner wires."
1,very bad quality,very bad quality. it is not safe at all.you might pay the same amount or more but you are going to safe your stuff and your home.
1,"low quality, loose in socket","If you buy this item your experience may vary, since each supplier will probably send you something different. The ones I bought would not stay in the wall socket - the fit was so bad the plug would simply fall out, or stay loose with bare metal exposed."
3,Good enough,"It looks good and fits perfect, thus the three stars. We bought two for two different laptops, the first cord fail intermittent, the second failed two months later. 2 out of 2, could be a coincidence, bat batch, what do we know. Anyways: good idea to keep some cords in the drawer in case of trouble."
2,Not a good buy,"It's hard to find 350x reading glasses in most stores so I found these online and ordered several pair. Sorry, they don't last very long because the earpiece breaks. I used to buy three pair for $20 at Sam's and they lasted forever; however, they don't come higher than 300x. I'll keep looking for glasses they last longer."
2,"Not bad,not greaat","These glasses have worked fine for me, but the design in rather ""old"" looking. Also, the left side temple piece came off about a month after I got them. I found the screw and fixed them but the hinge is poorly designed."
4,would be 5 stars but....,"Even though i found it when i looked back at the ad after my order arrived..... i didnt see that it was a single pair of glasses when i ordered, had i known i would have ordered elsewhere. but they are nice glasses... good frames, just wish it was the 2 pair i thought they were."
3,+3.50 Reading Glasses,The glasses were reasonably priced and it is hard to get this strength reading glasses over the counter. The only downside is the size of the glasses. They are so small that they remind me of the 1/2 glasses that some people wear and look over the top of. I am not sorry that I got the glasses but I certainly wish they were bigger so I wasn't looking over the top of them.
4,Rita In Her Prime - Wowzer!,"This is one of those films I never think is all that good, but I keep going back to it every four or five years. Perhaps it's just to get another look at Rita Hayworth while she was still THE glamor woman of the period (1940 to about 1948). At times, she is just jaw-dropping stunning.Glenn Ford provides some narration and does his normally-competent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more. He is really good as the rich husband, just fascinating to watch.This film would have been so much better had it been cut about 20 minutes. It bogs down a little over halfway through (but recovers). The dialog is what makes this story interesting for the most part, particularly in the first half of the film which is far better than the second half, and that includes the cinematography. The second half is a lot more melodrama than film noir."
5,Hate is the Only Thing That Warms Me....................,"This film is a prime example of how a superb cast of actors can save a mediocre screenplay. The story as another reviewer has noted is utterly nosensical in almost every way, but that is part of the charm of the film. Much of the dialouge between the characters is campy. The highlight of the film is Rita Hayworth singing "" Put The Blame on Mame "", This film is one of the best of the Film Noir films of the 40's and it was without a doubt the performance of Rita Hayworth's career."
5,"Anger, Revenge ... Ah, Love","Gilda is one of those movies which really helped define the film noir cycle of the 1940's-1950's. Rita Hayworth is powerful as the femme fatale who is ruthless; and then, yet, sympathetic. Glen Ford is the protagonist, but not the hero. Great (and dark) acting. Its in glorious black and white. The viewer gets so involved in the acting and the story, one forgets it is not in color very quickly. Themes to watch for: the male figure is strong in regard to just about everything except when it comes to interacting with Gilda. The femme fatale is tempting. Watch Gilda and begin to understand what film noir is all about.-- noir fan."
2,Good phone if you never leave it off charger,"Everything about this phone is good, except the battery life. From the very beginning the phone would go dead after 5 or 6 hours off the charger, even with no use. Now, several months later, they're only good for a couple of 5 minute calls before I have to switch phones. Customer service is useless--they acted as though their faulty product was my fault."
2,Disappointing,"We have owned this product for about two years and already had to purchase new (expensive) batteries for the handsets because they would no longer take a charge. Now the new batteries no longer hold enough charge for the speakerphone to function - if you press the speakerphone button, the battery life immediately goes to zero and the phone dies (and you lose the call). From the beginning, these phones would die if you left them off the charger overnight.The design is very slick and appealing, but we found that the features were clumsy and disappointing. You can't convert a caller ID number to a phone book entry because it doesn't include the ""1"". Phonebook entries on the two handsets are independent and can't be transferred. There is no headset jack.Overall I would not recommend this phone. We bought it at a discount at BJ's, and for our replacement set I'm paying more attention to customer reviews and will probably go with the Panasonic KX-TG9344T."
1,Also disappointing!,"Have had this phone less than 2 yrs, deleting messages almost impossible, button does not work to delete, skip, repeat or stop. Answering machine still runs and shows a message taken when no message is left. Would prefer a phone that answers when taken off charger instead of having to push the button to talk. Would not purchase this phone again."
5,A must for cross-stitchers,A must for cross-stitchers who also purchased Joan Elliott's Oriental Odissy.The book is very colourful & the patterns are bright & easy to follow.I love all of Joan Elliott's patterns & books. I'm always looking for more.
2,So-so account of sad event,"First of all the Kindle version is ridiculously poorly edited. I've never seen such a poor product put to market honestly.The account in the story had some redeeming elements in it, especially the aspects of how tough the women in the story were. However it was very union-biased and didn't quit tell a true account of both sides. Had it been more balanced I might have given it 3 stars."
1,Please,"If you expect anything even approaching an objective and truthful retelling or analysis of the Phelps Dodge strike, you'll be sadly disappointed. Kingsolver picks a series of unsubstantiated and self-interested stories of the strikers and completely ignores the horrible violence committed by the unions...."
3,A Carpenter Classic,"This movie's pretty good. For a horror movie. I say that because the movie doesn't have much violence, but it manages to stay thrilling. John Carpenter really did a good job on this one, eventhough some people may not like it, because it is not scary.If you think about it, it is more of a thriller. I wouldn't say this is the best John Carpenter film, but it ranks up in that area.Also the soundtrack. The theme music is very spooky, and the tune is just good to listen to.This film is pretty good."
4,Underrated,"Horror maestro John Carpenter's underrated adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the better King page to screen adaptations, and it's one of Carpenter's most suspenseful. Keith Gordon (Back to School) plays Arnie, a picked on high school kid who gets the car of his dreams with Christine, the only problem is no one else seems to like it, and it's not long before various people start getting picked off. While it's doesn't stay completely faithful to it's more spooky source, Christine manages to be an all the more terrifying excursion into suspense. The visual effects for their time are good (including some nifty and creative camera tricks), and the finely chosen cast (including future Baywatch star Alexandra Paul and Harry Dean Stanton) do great work. Carpenter's effectively creepy score also works great, and it livens up suspenseful scenes. This special edition DVD includes a lively commentary by Carpenter and Gordon, as well as some interesting featurettes on the film's creation."
4,A Carpenter Classic.,John Carpenter's adaptation to Stephen King's novel was a fright scare at the least. This film is about A teenage boy obsessed with his ol' car Christine. Well what happens next is predictable his car is maimed to kill anyone that he may not like but without him driving it. Still maybe corny to some but features a great Score similar to Halloween 3 by Carpenter. Features Alexandra Paul in a pre Baywatch era.
3,wasn't taken good care of,"When this movie arrived it had several stains on the cover. When opened it had dirt in it, and when we played it, it froze at a few parts."
2,Bad adaptation,"I liked the book a lot, and was excited about the movie, but it turned out to be a dissapointment. The characters were very bad and didn't really fit the part, and terrible acting. The car was still pretty cool, but they changed so much stuff in the movie, it was kinda boring. Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe it was bad, but my opinion is don't get it."
4,needs DTS!,"this is one of my favorite john carpenter movies, second only to halloween. it is also one of my favorite stephen king stories, so i have no complaints on the movie itself. the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of five, is because once again sony has rereleased a movie without given it the treatment it deserves, (at least as far as sound goes.) the picture looks fine, but there is no change in the sound. a movie like this deserves DTS. it would greatly enhance the sound of the engine when christine is on her rampage, plus it would bring out john carpenters score. it seems like the only time sony releases a movie with DTS, is with their superbit collection, which would be just fine if you could choose what movies they release in that format. o well, hopefully they will start adding DTS as an audio option more often in the future, or bring back superbit, christine would greatly appreciate it, as well as legend of zorro, and underworld evolution."
2,In All Honesty!!!!!!,"This movie really wasn't that great because a whole hour goes by before the car really does anything special. Christine could have had the potential to be a good movie but, it turned out to be kind of, to be frank: BORING!. I won't lie, I liked the part where Christine got revenge on the guys that tore her apart but, as a whole the movie just didn't measure up to my expectations."
4,Finally Christine on DVD done right,"I am soooo happy to see this finally released on DVD the right way.It is currently available on DVD and has been for some time now but that dvd was obviously rushed into production as there was one big thing missing.Special Features.This is one movie I want as much special fetures as possible and you'll get them with this new realese they areFeaturette'sChristine,Fast and FuriousChristine,Finish LineChristine,Ignitionthere will also be a photo galery and deleted scenes.The only thing I am disspaointed about is they still have not released the trailer wich has kept his from being a 5 star rating"
5,One of the greatest horror movies made period!,"This movie is just awsome. I loved it as a kid and still do. I f you like horror movies and classic cars, this ones for you!"
4,better than i remember,"for some reason i thought this movie was only mediocre, but then i rewatched it, and to be honest, it is quite good. john carpenter did a good job making it. good acting, good effects. good job overall. quite enjoyable."
5,reallly good scary movie,"I personally think Stephen King is a wonderful author and his movies are just as great, Christine is one of my favorite Movies and as old as this movie is it will alway's be scary in it's own right way's and just make's you shiver and want more."
3,A Low Octane Thriller,"This film does not do justice to the book. Many important details were changed and some left out all together. Carpenter abriged many elements of the story that made it scary, such as the nightmares, the car's strange smell, and the lights on the dashboard that seem to turn into eyes. The film manages to be entertaining, but lacks the suspense and emotional impact of the book."
3,Not as good as the book,"I read the book before I saw the film and was a bit disappointed. The movie skipped over a lot of the main theme - the fact that Arnie, as well as going insane, was turning into the cars previous owner, Mr LeBay. There was a lack of substance to the film but it's still worth watching to see the car rebuild itself from a heap of mangled metal. If you like the film, you'll love the book even more."
5,very happy with purchase,My purchase came quickly and I was very happy with the product! It was brand new and in great shape....all for a great price and great service!
5,Great cult classic,Christine is a great DVD if you enjoy that genre. It was the movie that started me on the road to enjoy horror films.
3,"great movie, poor sound","This movie is great. What can I say! The picture quality is excellent. Sadly, I was disappointed with the 2.0 stereo sound, which makes no use of my subwoofer. On my duntech speakers there was definately something missing without the subwoofer rumbling the room.If sound does not worry you, buy this one. It's a great movie."
3,too far off,this is a good movie but not close enough to the book.However i still liked and would say to people they should see it
4,"""Carpenter/King Classic!""","Keith Gordon, John Stockwell and Alexandra Paul star in JohnCarpenter's 1983 horror film based on Stephen King's novel.A teen gets possessed by his 1958 Plymouth Fury that killspeople. This is a great film and this dvd has good pictureand sound plus neat extras. I recommend this Carpenter/King classic."
3,Its ok but needs work,"The idea you can rent off Amazon is a great one but the video was a little choppy, Besides that, it was a good purchase"
5,Is that you Cunningham?????!!!!,"I love this movie! A must for anyone's collection! Brought back so many memories! It's crazy and a bit violent, some rough language, but never should be forgotten as one of the cult classics of our time!The DVD arrived in perfect shape also."
4,As good as Cult Favorites get......The video transfer could be better,I loved the movie.This version has lots of extras to let you intothe world of making christine.Was more darkly funny and romanticthan scary.The visual effects were really good for 1983.Cudos toJohn Carpenter and the no-name cast who elevated this to thecult classic status it deserves.The one con it the video transfer is questionable.They neglected to clean up theold film dirt during the digital transfer.A Shame as everything elseis great.A Great Movie....recommmended A+A+A+
5,Chistine,Love the move Christine. Since it is about a Plymouthautomoblile and I a member of the National PlymouthOwner's Club the movie makes it more interesting andexciting to watch.
2,"Here in my car, I feel safest of all","High school nerd sees the car of his dreams and has to have it, ignoring the history of deaths that come along with the purchase. But this is no ordinary car, it's alive. Follows up with the predictable development: parents don't like car, bullies trash car, car gets even. Some of the cast choices are good but whatever talent this movie has, it needs a better screenplay. Preston is wife of John Travolta and you can see the bum Blossom in HOME ALONE."
1,Ugh! What a waste!,"The only ""horror"" in this movie was seeing any number of classic 1950's Plymouths mangled in the process of filming it! If they had to trash so many cars, why couldn't they have used something like a Pinto that no one would have cared about? The plot? A high school dork is slowly ""possesed"" by his demonic car. Gee, that's scary ..... NOT! What a goofy concept for a story! When King is hot, he's hot (""Misery"" being a classic of suspense and psychological terror) but when he's not, he just plain sucks!"
1,John Carpenters first dud...,"The reason I love John Carpenter is his movies are entertaining. They may be scary, creepy, atmospheric, funny, whatever but generally entertaining.Today I just finished watching Christine for the second time and for the first time in many many years. Boring. Not scary, not creepy, not atmospheric, not funny. Not anything but boring. Boring.I suppose if I believed in supernatural cars this might do something for me. But I don't and it doesn't. In my opinion if one goes through the Carpenter canon in chronological order this would be his first dud. Even the usual great Carpenter music that accompanied so many of his movies back then is missing. He relies on commercial hits of the past.A dud. Did I mention the acting is horrid? The acting is horrid. Unless you are a completist or it does not take much to entertain you, I would say avoid this dud. Disappointing to say the least."
1,Horrible- if you read the book,"This movie was the biggest disappointment of any Stephen Kings books. If anyone read the book they would know about the deep characters built, and the story line. Instead the worthless John Carpenter skipped the real story of Christine, didn't even have the Lebay alive at the beginning and just his brother- please. This is like a movie version if you bought Cliff notes. I was never more disappointed in a SK book to movie in my life."
5,Christine the movie,I recieved the DVD Christine and viewed it immedaitely. It was good condition and recieved in timely manner. Enjoyed it very much.
5,"For Laci:A mother's Story of Love,Loss, and Justice","Very well written, Having lost my own son at age 11, I can truly empathize and experience a lot of the same feelings as Sharon Rocha. Writing this book had to have been very difficult for her and she should be very proud to carry on Laci's legacy this way."
5,Heartwrenching...,An absolutely true insight to the life of Laci Peterson. Written very well by her mother Sharon Rocha. She gave the readers exactly what they wanted to know about the girl everyone wish they would have known...
5,A RARE GLIMPSE OF THE GIRL BEHIND THE GORGEOUS SMILE,"I've followed this case very closely & after how many books...finally, we actually get to know something about Laci, besides how she ended up in death at the hands of her monstrous husband. Sharon Rocha does a remarkable job detailing how her world spiraled into despair starting on Christmas Eve 2002. For those 5 of you who still believe in peterhead's innocence, you need to read how he (& his parents) treated the family of his ""amazing"" wife in the aftermath of her disappearance. Some proceeds from this book will benefit the Laci & Conner Search & Rescue Fund to aid in the search for other missing people. I totally agree with the other reviewer ""Sharon, Laci would be so proud of you!"""
5,excellent book,"EXCELLENT BOOK, GOOD SERVICE, WOULD OF LIKED IT A LITTLE SOONER, GOOD CONDITION. HAVE READ MOST ALL THE BOOKSOF THIS CRIME.THANK YOU AMAZON AND THE DEALER I ORDERED FROM. ANOTHER HAPPY AMAZON CUSTOMER, S"
5,one of the best books I've ever read,"being a mother, my heart bleeds for Sharon...I cried through the whole story - that Scott deserves nothing less than eternal hell - he did it - there is no doubt - I just cannot believe the difference from ""lover"" to ""murderer"" - I've seen it, not the murderer part but know of hot/cold people - it boggles the mind that even when they(Laci's family) tried to extend sympathy to the Peterson family they said ""F you"" in those words - I cannot get over that unless their own shame for what their son clearly did astounds them as well - I don't know - I just know that this book is amazing and I kiss my little ones extra hard because I cannot imagine having to go through something like this - God Bless Sharon, and Ron and Bret and Amy - hopefully you shall find peace - never again will I sweat the small stuff - this book had more of a profound effect on me than I thought it would - every mother/father should read it - it's unreal...."
5,"For Laci: A Mother's Story of Love, Loss, and Justice","I was born, raised and lived in Modesto, Ca. until 2005 where this story originated, after this terrible tragedy had occurred. I felt compelled to purchase this book and it came to me in impeccable condition. Amazon.com has proven to be the place to purchase books, music, etc. without worry about the product being in good condition or of good quality. You can't go wrong with Amazon.com."
5,Moving Reviews....,"If I had the money, I would rush out and buy this book after reading all the moving reviews written about it. I still tear up thinking about this Mother's love for her child..."
4,From the heart,"This book is obviously written from the heart and soul of Laci's mother. This is one strong woman. To hear the gut wrenching things she went through, I cannot even imagine as a mother. This was very well written...you could really feel the pain. I am glad she wrote this book. I hope it in someway helped her through the grieving/healing process. God bless you Sharon."
3,How could there be any doubt?,"It is evident Sharon Rocha isn't a literary giant, but, she definitely is a mother who loved her daughter.I got some insight I didn't have before on Scott Peterson. He's where he belongs. Actually, it's unfortunate he isn't the one who's head is somewhere in the bay."
3,Gift,I purchased this book for my daughter. She read and finished the book and told me that it was well written and that it was very interesting reading. I didn't read it so I would be hesitant to recommend.
1,Righteous,"Reading the book made me, at times, feel sick to my stomach. Sharon Rocha's righteous position is hard to bear. Is she the expert when to decide which of Scott Peterson's behavior is appropriate and which is not? Anyway she draws the line and basta. She has no doubts once she has made up her mind and she somehow manipulates the people around her to feel and express the same. She's been through hell and at the same time she highly contributed to make the investigation a circus. I hated the way she treated the Peterson family, how she interprets their very actions. I had the notion that if it was her decision there wouldn't have been a trial, her point was made long before."
4,The loss of love,"This is a compelling book which reads very quickly, as it is hard to put down. Sharon Rocha paints a lovely portrait of her daughter Laci. You can't help be empathetic as evil moves in around her. I have an incredible amount of respect for her and the search-and-rescue fund/foundation she created. This tugs at heartstrings and elicits tears. I can't help but cry."
4,Was very interested in her perspective,"I followed this case from the begining, and was riveted. I always wondered what Sharon Rocha though and felt as she went through this horrible tragedy. While reading the book, I kept wanting the story to change, as if I didn't know the ending. I also kept shaking my head at the senslessness of Laci's murder. I learned details of the case I hadn't heard before, and a different perspective of some of the same things I'd read in other books, namely the disgusting behavior of the Peterson family."
4,For Laci...,"Sharon Rocha allows us to get to know her and her daughter, Laci as she writes about their life as mother and daughter. I disagree with her scenario about what happened to Laci and who caused her death but her story is heart wrenching and emotional. No matter what you believe about what actually happened, Sharons book was a great read and my thoughts and prayers are with her and her family. Highly recommended. Thank you."
5,A Mother's Love is Like No Other,"As someone who actually went to school with Laci, this is by far the best account of who Laci truly was as a daughter, sister, wife, and mother-to-be. Who better to know that than her own mother? Their smiles are the same, their spirits are the same, their love is as strong as any love can be. This is a testiment that will transcend time and provides not only insight into Laci's meaningful yet short journey, but also a mother's love and determination for justice. I was fortunate enough to experience Laci's smile firsthand, but for those of you who have only seen it through the media, Sharon Rocha gives you the sweet and poignant story behind that very smile."
3,Interesting and tragic story from a mother's point of view,"I found this book to be helpful in seeing such a tragedy from a parent's point of view when losing a child to murder. The entire world is familiar with the story of the very self-absorbed husband, Scott, murdering his very pregnant wife Laci. What they may not know is the extreme lack of rights available to the victim's family or the tedious and exhausting court process they must endure. I found this an honestly written book by Laci's mother, Sharon, with no agenda other than to shine a light on details that were not always shared with the public regarding this case as well as trying to help other parents through a similar experience. Although a very tragic story, it was an interesting read and very touching. You get a very strong sense of just how much pain the family had to endure and still must endure and I believe this to be well written book for its subject matter."
5,loving story,best book i read in years.. lacis mother has made us feel like we know the real laci.. her pain is felt by anyone who reads this book..couldnt put it down..
4,Truthful,"It's a sad story. I believe that the author of this book gave me all of the honest answers about this case. The author is the mother of the victim, and it seemed like she wrote the story so her friends, family and volunteers could read it. That's why I believed that this book was truthful."
5,"Bravo, Sharon!","I still can't stop crying as I write this, having just finished this heart-wrenching, inspiring book that should be a must read for anyone who is a mother or who has ever loved a child. Sharon Rocha brings her beautiful daughter to life again and ensures that Laci will live forever. She certainly will live in my heart forever and will always have my thoughts and prayers with her. God Bless Sharon Rocha and her angel, Laci."
5,An excellent read,"This was an excellent book. I truly feel that the right person is where he needs to be after acquiring the information in this book. My heart continues to go out to Laci's family for the cruelness they had to live through. I passed this book along to my friends and family so that they may enjoy this book. Almost immediately after reading this book, I saw ladybugs on windowsills everwhere. I couldn't help but to think of Laci each time. My prayers will stay with you!"
5,Best read in a long time,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was totally in awe of Sharon Rocha for her strength and determination to bring justice for Laci and Connor. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who was as enthralled with this case as I was.Clare Scott, Las Vegas, NV"
5,For Laci - Very informative.,"I found this book to be informative, and it let the reader know the feelings of the Mom (Sharon Rocha) and the whole family. Sharon was completely devastated with the loss of Laci, and I think this book also showed what a cad Scott Peterson really was. I've never read about such a cold person, with no friends to call his own, and he married a beautiful girl with so many friends, and these girls stuck by her even after she was missing, and were on her side all through the trial. It was all about getting justice for Laci. Sharon had so many loyal supporters, and it just shows the warmth that people all over had for the unknown girl called ""Laci"", and also the Modesto Police Department who also gave their support! I recommend this book highly."
4,A Mothers Journey,"I have read all the books on the case. This book is an intimate look into a mother's journey resulting from the death of her beloved daughter. There was more to who Laci was as a person (she was a daughter, BUT also a friend, wife, sister,daughter in law, aunt..). This book is ONE perspective of Laci as a person. Sharon Rocha brings her to ""life"", in the way only a mother can. If you are searching for new facts, evidence or smoking guns- this is not the most accurate book and certainly not the most objective out there (nor do I believe that was Sharon Rocha's intent). The focus is on her daughter and her feelings and insights as a mother). I was disappointed in the jabs at the Peterson family. I feel it kind of took away from the story and Laci's memory, somehow. Taking this with a grain of salt, if you are looking for insight into a mother's journey through a wrenching, tragic loss and into part of Laci as a person, this is the book for you. Lovely pictures as well."
5,The love of a mother...,"Well written, straight from the heart. Lacy's mother, does an amazing job despite her hurt and loss. I read the negative reviews and cannot fathom how some people would even consider defending such a person. (person???) The negative reviews only made me want to read this book even more. Thank you to the 1-star critics...."
4,"Sad, but a much needed story for Laci!","Sharon Rocha wrote from her heart. The story kept me interested the whole time. A few things may have been redundant but she was genuine and real through out the book. I could feel the joy in Sharon when she talked about Laci and her childhood. I could feel the sadness when she talked about Laciand when she went missing! Now that Scott is behind bars (where he needs to be), I hope she can find peace. A good but sad story!"
5,heartbreaking,"This book, in a word, was heartbreaking. It very much shows you the hell that Sharon Rocha went through after getting that 5:17 phone call from Scott. It shows you, up close, what Scott's reactions were to the different situations - how he and Laci met, Laci's life before Scott, and how awful Sharon's life was after Laci. It talks about the trial and how difficult that was. This is an amazing read, heartbreaking as it is. I strongly recommend it."
3,so-so valve caps,"they are a recycled plastic/paper product, so they have no sheen to them. they work great, and look good, but just wish they were shiny (as pictured)"
2,Very slow read!,"I bought this book because our sorority alumnae chapter chose it as a book club selection. Not one of the ladies was able to get through the book. The book should not list an author, instead list the person who compiled a bunch of other peoples ideas together. Most pages had more in the footnotes section than on the page. It was accurate - from what I read, but extremely dry and devoid of any life. What could have been a historically accurate depiction of the struggles that women went through to start their own collegiate social clubs, was instead a pieced together collection of excerpts from other books."
1,dg products are very porely made and dont fit,hidg products are very porely made and dont fit if you call dg they say that they dont know why it will not fit and have not had problems with them but if you get on some of the forums and read you can see all the problems. on the plus side the store i bought it from was great they returned it and gave me a full refund
5,My Favorite Training Partner,Received as gift - along with a personalized leather case by ValetStand. I just clip it on my strap and walk around. This is my most used training tool.
1,Nice Idea but not a good product,"I have used the Tascam CD trainers for many years and I bought one of these MP3 trainers when they came out. I liked using the MP3 files instead of messing with CDs. However, the controls on the MPGT1 were kind or crappy and never work as well as the play, stop, rewind, loop, controls on TASCAM's CD players. The menu system is awkward and the big bumpy wheel control is just a crappy control."
4,Great but not perfect,"I agree with all the good reviews on this product. It has increased my abilities more than any method has. But don't expect great sound quality when you slow down MP3's, it's not pleasant sounding, but definately still helps in snagging those quick notes and phrases. Other downside is having to step through the menus everytime you want to slow down or speed up the song, that feature should be available straight from the thumbwheel on the unit. Last complaint is when slowing down, the only increments are -4, -8, -12, -16, -32, -50. Going from -16 to -32 is a huge jump. There needs to be a couple more levels in between. (Going from -32 to -50 is huge as well, but that's just going from very slow to painfully slow.)Overall I think I'd still recommend this product, just not sure if the lack of more slower speeds will become an issue or not over time."
3,A few gripes,"I agree with other reviewers. Yes, it is very easy to use. No one seems to talk about the FX features. You can add special FX to your guitar sounds - metal, reverb, chorus, crunch, etc. I find that aspect of this rather cumbersome because you need to drill down in to several menus in order to change a setting."
4,Waiting on the next blessing,"Lisa - and those who hear your voice/music. You are so from the gut with experience, Spirit and Truth...and I love it. There's nothing better than hearing someone sing with conviction.... sincerely and genuinely; keep letting Christ and your own style flow thru you. I have loved witness for many years...even when other music seemed stale. And to see you perform live is electrifying because you allow your personality to shine thru as well. Keep changing and growing with these times - Witness too; Loving ""Appointed Time"" cd - The Lord does fight my battles!! Under www.pre-destineemusic.com - i am just a fledgling myself... I hope to touch as many people as you have with the gospel of Jesus Christ. If I could see you - I'd give you the biggest hug and kiss; you and your husband/family ARE blessed. Always a fan!!A brother in Christ,JesuGuruDouglas"
4,If you like Chri Kattan...,"I heard this movie was totally hilarious. I would not go that far, but I did enjoy it and it is quite funny if you like Chris' humor and I do!!"
3,Okay for a bargain matinee,"This movie has its funny parts, but sometimes it's a bit too corny. The Corky character has its moments, as he tried to make good in the mob family he's been estranged from. Also, it's good to see Peter Falk is still working. And the ending is actually pretty good, as Corky succeeds in getting the goods on his father away from the Feds and is reunited with his now adoring family. Go see it at a bargain matinee."
4,Quirky,"Led by SNL funnyman Chris Kattan, Corky Romano is a hilarious movie that surpassed all expectations that I levied to it. I did not have much hope for it since lately, whenever an SNL star goes off and does something on their own, it seems to be a total a complete failure that just humiliates themselves and the show to a maximum.Well, Chris Kattan does a great job here. He's fresh and quirky. There are not many people in Hollywood that can pull of humor like this, and Kattan does a brilliant job.The movie has a strong script with a strong supporting cast. I didn't much care for Peter Falk's character, but everyone else was very well played. There were many one-liners that caught you off guard.I don't give it five stars because the film did take a long time to get going and at the end it kind of dropped off. But, besides that, Corky Romano is one of the year's most surprising movies. 4 Stars"
3,Corky Romano,"A Hilarious Comedy!It kept me entertained and laughing throughthe whole entire movie. It stars Chris Kattan, Peter Falk, Chris Penn, Peter Berg, Fred Willard and Richard Roundtree."
3,A gift,I bought this as a gift for an adult child. It was a request from them and I have not seen the movie.
2,Ehhh...,"I am a giant fan of ""Saturday Night Live"" and admittidly a fan of A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY and SUPERSTER, heck, even THE LADIES MAN. I like Chris Kattan. I thought he was great in MONKEYBONE. But his latest movie goes a bit too far. Yes, it does have it's funny moments, but ultimatly falls flat. I laughed, actually, I laughed a lot. But I wondered why I was laughing and sometimes felt bad. There are a lot of missed oppurtunities and way too much slapstick. Kattan does comedy (and physical comedy) well, but in CORKY ROMANO, his routine is dry and shctick way over the top. C-"
3,Corky is Chris Kattan's finest hour!,"A hilarious , stupid , silly and sometimes gross comedy starring SNL star Chris Kattan. He is a member of a family full of mobsters , but he is an Assistant Veternarian. The family makes him go undercover as an F.B.I agent because The F.B.I is sending people undercover as mobsters too. If you like silly comedies with Chris Kattan , buy this immediatley! Starring: Chris Kattan , Vinessa Shaw , Peter Falk , Peter Berg , Chris Penn ,Mathew Glave , Vincent Pastore , Richard Roundtree and Fred Ward...."
1,Corny Romano...,"When it comes to SNL inspired films, you kind of have to walk in expecting them to be rather corny. I did that, but then again, there are a slew of SNL spin-off films that have carried their own weight or at least proved to be entertaining. The problem I have with `Corky Romano' is that it just plain isn't funny; at all. The premise is promising, in the vein of comedies of this nature, but it just doesn't deliver the goods as I had hoped it would. I've never been a huge fan of Chris Kattan. His breed of funny just doesn't work as well on him as it does on SNL castmate Will Ferrell. Kattan tries too hard, and it shows. Alas, some will like this and that is cool, but this comedy was NOT my cup of tea. You'd be hard-pressed to find a gag or joke that lands just right; most of them flutter awkwardly to the floor. You can skip this one and rest easy knowing you didn't miss anything."
2,put a cork in it Corky,"man, Kattan is so annoying in this movie, I, I just wish it was never made for some reason but I cant deny that this was ok funny, yes I say it it was ok funny. the highlight is when Corky is wacked out of his skull on cocaine and he starts acting crazy in front of the kids, so hilarious. otherwise its a movie full of unfunny and dry jokes and nonstop nagging and whining from Peter Berg and Chris Penn(whos gay in this one and is wrong). Peter Falk(Columbo) is wasted as Pops Romano. one bad, wrong joke of a movie"
2,corky romano,I don't recomend this movie to you because it's supposed to be a comedy but it wasn't very funny. Well maybe some parts were funny but not really. That's just my opinion but you could see it if you wanted to. But i'm just saying it wasn't very good.
4,Seal -A-Meal Rolls 11 inchX 18foot,Good size for sealing food. Shipped quickly and much better price than in the stores. will buy again when needed.
1,Flimsy And Leaks!,These never seal - there are too many leaks because the quality is so cheap - I've never seen bags so flimsy. Another problem is that quart sized bags were to be included as advertised; not received. We have been going crazy trying to make these work but every one we use does NOT seal properly! Waste of money and time!
3,Miss leading!!!,"Rival FSSMBF0626 11-Inch by 18-Foot Seal-a-Meal Rolls, 2-Pack...they are a two pack either they are so thin or shorter than 18ft, just measured they are 9ft rolls...they should say Seal-a-Meal 2-Pack 9ft rolls each...miss leading completly...oh well lesson learned..so beware..."
4,"Good product, but...","I was mostly happy with my purchase. The rolls do what they're supposed to. My only problem is that the details on the sale site also mentioned 3 1-quart bags would be included, and they were not. If they aren't included, the part of the description that mentions them should be removed."
3,Seal a Meal Bag,This is not the original plastic bag refill. It is 50% thinner however does have the texture of the original bulk bag roll. Do not expect this product to be as durable as the original roll of bag material. It is priced as cheap as possible however is expensive based on what your getting (cost per bag).
2,Not the same product as in the picture?,I just received this product and nowhere does it say Rival on it. I'm wondering why the picture clearly states Rival and the box i received has SealaMeal on it. Nowhere on or in this package does it say Rival anywhere. I really expected exactly what was shown for the item description and the picture should match. I have not used this item yet so it may be a decent product but this false advertisement really pissed me off as i could have had this same item ad Target for the same price minus the shipping but i wanted the Rival name as that is what i researched and found most people to like the most.
1,Rip OFF,"Item is improperly advertised. The rolls are 11""in by 9'. The AMAZON AD STATES THAT THE ROLLS ARE 11"" X18' EACH. They are 9' each. If you scroll down, you get the truth.Item being reviewedSeal-A-Meal FSSMBF0626 11-Inch by 18-Foot Seal-a-Meal Rolls,set of 2 rolls"
2,The product seemed as if it had been used.,"I chose this rating because, the box was open and the bags appeared to be used. I will not order this product again."
4,Works fine but not the best value,"These rolls work perfectly in my cheapo seal-a-meal. I find the description makes it a bit error-prone - for example the Foodsaver rolls on Amazon give the size per roll, whereas this one gives the total size. So when you compare remember to take that into account. That's my only reason for docking 1 star - I do like the product otherwise."
3,It's ok!,"Seals well and is strong but it's not clear on any of the sides, so you can't see how the food looks and it's not pleasant to look at.I say it's worth it but if you have acouple dollars extra, get the foodsaver rolls!"
2,Misleading title,"The title states TWO 11 inch by 18 feet rolls, this is NOT TRUE! It is 2 rolls that TOTAL 18 feet!So you are not getting 36 feet as it sounds. Be aware! And you do not get free bags as the listing states."
4,Great!,I really enjoyed this book. It is an emotional and in some places heartbreaking book. But I really liked the characters in this book and I could empathize with them. This story reminds me of the power of suggestion and small town ignorance. But it is also a story of redemption. I would highly recommend it.
5,A must read for any romance fan,"Kay Stockham delivers an emotionally charges story in, Man With A Past.Joe Brody, newly released after 10 years in prison, is treated with distain upon his return to his hometown. Joe has always sworn he never harmed his newborn daughter. All he wants to do is rebuild his life with his widowed father.

Their connection is very emotional and wonderfully sensual.Man With A Past is an exceptional story. It really makes you feel the pain and the joy of these two characters. This books tugs at your heart and is a treat from beginning to end."
3,Telephony ABCs,Covered most of the information needed to compilean RFP for a new system but lacked some of thealphabet soup that most manufacturers tack on totheir equipment or software!
3,Missing something,"This book do have a look of terms and reference but disappointingly, I cannot find some popular terms such as LMDS, MMDS and DTM. I suggest that everyone should have a look first before you buy this book."
4,Very Helpful,This is a great book for someone is starting in the telecom field! It explains all the little acronyms that I hear around the office and I have a better understanding on how the telecom industry works!
1,Utterly Useless because of Factual and Editorial Errors,"This book attempts to define many of the terms/acronyms, etc you encounter in daily life working in the internet and telcom world. Unfortunatly, there are so many errors in this book that it makes it useless at best, and mideducational at worst. In 10 minutes of flipping through pages, I counted atleast a dozen errors, and that was enough to put any information presented in this volume into a questionable state.Examples, according to the book: A T1 is also known as a DS0 An OC3 has 255 Megabits of bandwidth, and an OC192 is 3 OCs.I was hoping for a handy desktop reference and got oh so much less."
5,Impressive reference--Photos and graphs are excellent.,Impressive reference. I found the photos and graphs to be excellent exhibits to assist in further defining and explaining the terminology.Jess Holden
2,Often incomplete and sometimes inacurate,"The best parts of the book are its explanations of telephony plant. When the book attempts to explain larger industry topic and operational support, it becomes very vague and at times quite inaccurate. Is good book to give you an idea about the telephony industry, but don't quote it!"
2,The more I read it the less I like it...,"When I first reviewed the McGraw-Hill Illustrated Telecom dictionary I thought it was a great find, I even recommended it to students in my TrainingCity.com Voice & Data training classes. Not anymore. The more I read it the more errors and incorrect information I find. For example a table in the book identifies OC3 - OC48 as having the same bit/sec rate!Conclusion, the CD-ROM is nice, but I recommend you avoid this book and buy Newton's Telecom Dictionary."
1,Missing something,"The book is big and contains a lot of terms. However, it is not even close to comphrensive.Are DWDM, LMDS, MMDS and DTM popular words? Are these things you want to learn more? Are they important in this Telecosm? They are ALL NOT in this book. Totally disappointed"
3,"Out of date content! However, good explanation, good CD-ROM.","Good explanation, good CD-ROM dictionary, but sorry for the content, it is out of date, I can't even find these two important acronyms or should I say, two important protocols - ITU (International Telecommunication Union), ETSI (European Telecommunication Standard Institute)"
2,"Not great, very thin...",I sent these back because it only has one small pouch of lavender filling that only heats one side of the hand. Not good enough! The mitts I had before surrounded the entire hand with filling but they're worn out and I can't find another pair like them. Too bad because the outside is really nice.
2,And she teaches writing??,"Good plot, bad writing. Did she ever take writing classes herself? Did she ever hear of ""show, don't tell""? Too, too precious at times!"
3,"Biography is wide-ranging, but short on analysis.","Ms. Dearborn's book, though a good read, seems to be mostly an update of the previous biographies of Mailer. It's not clear what else she brought to the subject. Her views of Mailer's books are fairly representative of conventional wisdom (she liked ""Armies of the Night"", didn't like ""Of a Fire on the Moon"") and her efforts to chronicle his personal foibles are fairly predictable. I admit my bias as an unabashed Mailer fan, and perhaps that led me to expect more discussion of the literary aspects of Mailer's life, since the personal matters had already been examined extensively by Hillary Mills and others. Still, I enjoyed the book."
1,"A useless, redundant assemblage.","Mailer stands as one of the most biographied of living important writers, and you wonder why Dearborn bothered with this project at all. I would guess it was precisely because there is so much already extant material, primary and secondary, that she thought the material would fall together in a sing song formula, a recital of grimmly familiar facts. Such seems the case. The ""unprecedented"" access she has to you materials in regards to Mailer's work and life is a reedy claim, a dead blade of grass the wind blows away, and the author's absolute inability to bring any insight, interpretation or analysis to Mailer's work is infuriating. Now , one may presume, Mailer's career is at a point when the longer view of a 51 years of writing is most what this work demands, and Dearborn gives us summer re-runs. This book is like reading old gossip magazines. One mourns the trees sacrificed to print this screed."
2,a boring weatern,"I did not like the movie Silverado. In the movie there needed to be more blood in the movie because i like seeing blood splater all over the place. Also because i never really liked westerns.This western was the same as any other, good guys bad guys and a sherrif. In the movie there are alot of gunfights but not alot of killing.There was also alot of bad acting in the movie.So i recomend you save your time and money and watch a movie that has alot a blood."
2,the boring movie,"From my opinion the movie is boring and they need more blood and violence. They need more matrix and the sound doesnt help the movie at all. If anyone wants to take me to the movie i would say ""no"". And if i had to say one word about the movie it would be"" BORING"". And i would never pay my own money to go watch the movie. ""I didnt understand it and i didnt like it""."
1,Forgettable,"Let's face it, Director Lawrence Kasdan is too much of a contemplate-your-navel film director to make a good Western. Like his intermidable ""The Big Chill,"" ""Silverado"" is overly long, overly chatty and a total bore. Sure its got a great cast (though these days, the presence of Kevin Costner might make one reconsider the use of the term ""great""), but they are wasted in the wake of an unnecessarily convoluted plot. If you want a great modern Western, try ""Tombstone"" or ""Unforgiven"" instead."
1,A Boring Western Movie is... Silverado!!,"Have you ever seen a Western movie that you didn't like? Well I have,it's called Silverado and I hated it!! I had to watch it in class but I didn't pay attention in some parts. I like movies that are funny,scary,and that has drama. Silverado is not a good movie so DON'T see it! The soundtrack is boring and I don't like how it was. The movie wasn't interesting and it made me fall asleep in some parts. I didn't like the way Silverado was all about guns and killing. I don't like cowboy movies. This movie isn't a good movie so don't spend your time or money on the movie."
1,a terrible western,"my opinion on this movie is that it was hard to beleive that none of the ""heroes"" were fatally shot or killed. They must have been shot at 50000 times for each of them and they were not even killed. They should rename this movie ,""The Invincible Four"". I really find it hard to beleive that the wild west was like that. I look for a movie to stick to the boundaries it was given for ex. if this movie was set on boundaries like the Matrix .. where you can fly, dodge bullets, jump on horses, jump in the air and shoot people.. then it would have made more sense but it was not set on those boundaries making it a stupid , hollywood film that really was just .. terrible. Also you all know that Jake screws around too much and would have been shot.. Mal with his stupid two shotguns fighting 6 people in a bar and winning was absurd.. Emmet getting trampled on by horses and not seeming to break any ribs.. Paden messing around with all the females and not getting hiv.. it was very bad."
5,Great deal on a movie,"Just what I wanted, two movies for a great price. I couldn't find it locally, but found this great deal online. Just as described too."
4,Back to Basics,"Now I tell you, I give my right arm for a western like this one. This is a modern day Classic by Lawrence Kasden, and he did a good job on this one. The Music Score is just great and if you remember, they used this opening music for one of the NBA's Alstar games years ago.Add this to your collection of Westerns along side ""John Wayne"" and ""Clint Eastwood"" Classics. I like ""Kevin Costner"" in this one."
5,"A very great Western, lots of talent and stars in this one","A truly great western and one of a few modern ones that can hold there own with any made in the John Wayne and early Eastwood era. Lots of stars in this flick with a very young looking Costner and a whole bunch of talent in small roles that will later appear as costars or stars in entire movies. The plot is very well written the characters believable and the shoot out scenes lots of fun to watch. The horse riding and cinematography are both very beautiful. I first saw this in the theaters and was impressed, it is still fun to watch. A very strong recommendation to any that like westerns but I would venture that any movie watcher would at the very least not feel they wasted time. A good movie to own can be watched multiple times."
5,Love the movie,Love the movie. The price was reasonable. The service excellent. Good deals are always great.
5,Silverado,I love this movie..It's about 4 men who end up meeting and saving each others lives on their way to Silverado..There's killin' and great Saloon scenes and 1 really funny scene with Scott Glenn running through some theives hide out..U will really enjoy this cowboy flick..
5,technically superior DVD and great movie,"This DVD has the two most important technical things to look for in a DVD format: widescreen anamorphic video and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. The latter is stupendous, with discreet sounds from each speaker, you really feel as though you are *in* the movie (compare this to the trailer in the special section to get a feel of how the sound has been enhanced for this format)The movie is wonderful with an unbelievable cast and wonderful performances from each. Fans of Kevin Kline, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner will be especially happy.This is a happy addition to my growing DVD collection"
4,Always a favorite,"Have enjoyed since first viewing many years ago. One of the early movies in ""surround"". A western fan all my life."
3,Twisted story,The storyline is bizzare. Acting is good and filming is good. I would recommend it to a die hard western fan. Not a family oriented film.
5,l used hate westens movies,l used to hate western movie but i change my mind l say silveroda that movie change a hole lot of my opinion about weatern movie.That movie had a lot what i find in a movie .IT had lots frighting shootouts drama it fun to see.that what western post to have.i did think this movie was going to be weatern with cowboy horse gunshuting and barfright .this was good movies not like other western movie that have nothing to with hole movies .the muasic was great it made it more intersing the movie u jump out if your set.silveroda was a good movie to .if you never see a western movie you should see this one .
5,One of the Great Westerns!,"This is one of the most beautifully photographed, intelligent, positively flavored and exciting westerns you are likely to see. I rate this up there with ""Magnificent Seven"", ""Wild Bunch"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""The Searchers"" and ""Tombstone"". All cast members are superb and perfect in their parts. There is humor, but realism in costume and sets. Linda Hunt is marvelous, as is Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner. Scott Glenn's best film in my opinion.The action is non-stop, but not gratuitous... for every bullet means something. This is also okay for teens, since blood and sex are at a minimum and the action is so intense.For sheer beauty of photography, and scope and expanse, you can't beat this one... and the new DVD transfer in anamorphic widescreen is clean, clear and color corrected. The stereophonic soundtrack with the gorgeous score by Bruce Boughton will move you.Top marks for this one!"
2,NOT A VERY GOOD WESTERN,"I didnt realy like movie very munch because I,ve seen better westerns than that one. the only thing I like about it is that tere was a lot of gun fights in the movie there was kidnapping fires . I wouldnt see it in thearters i would just wait for it to come out on dvd or vhs .In awestern I would espect roberys breaking out of jail moe hanging.I thought the movie kinda suck because the bigining suck a lot . The way this movie identifis a western is that theres cow boys and guns farms horses and cattle. One of the forshowdowing is when someguys got jack by bad guys."
3,I would have enjoyed it 100% if...,"...Kevin Costner had sunk for real in his waterworld, and so would not have been able to spoil my pleasure watching an otherwise fine cast. Luckily they were too many for him, so he could not ruin it completely. But I'd like very much to see a remake with anybody else able to act, so I could put 5 stars."
3,The intersting riding,I never had really seen this movie but i thought it was pretty cool for a western movie.But sometimes the movie was pretty boring. This movie was not my kind of movie .My kind of movie is action and movies that are really funny.This movie had alot of action and shooting .This movie has alot of good actors.This movie will be better if it had more funny parts.I recomend to people if their western movie fans too watch siverado.
2,MY OPINION,I REALLY DON'T LIKE WESTERN MOVIES BECAUSE THEY ARE BORING AND HAVE NO MEANING TO IT BUT THAT IS MY OPINION. BUT IN THE MOVIE THERE WAS GOOD AND BAD GUYS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE.THE PARTS IN THE MOVIE THAT I LIKED ABOUT IT WAS THE PARTS THEY WERE FIGHTING IN .THE MUSIC THAT WHEN'T WITH THE MOVIE REALLY FIT THE THE MOVIE BUT NOT THE TYPE OF MUSIC I WOULD LISTEN TO MY THAT I WATCH ARE HORROR AND COMEBY. I WOULD TELL A PERSON THAT IF THEY LIKE WESTERN MOVIES THEY SHOULD WATCH IT BUT IF THEY DON'T I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD LIKE IT. AND I AM LOOKING IN A MOVIE IS THAT THEY ARE NOT BORING AND HAVE MEANING TO IT.
5,Kevin Costner at his best,I really enjoyed this movie witch i own on DVD. It is a great western with pretty scenery and wonderful costumes. I think this should have won ACADEMY AWARDS. It was nominated for 2 but never won. Asham it is sutch a great film!
5,A whole lotta fun,"I remember first seeing this film (as a little kid) in 50mm. The screen was huge, showing every last detail of the beautiful countryside panoramic shots that fill the movie. I was blown away. Then I got to watch a truly fun story with great acting, sometimes cheesy dialogue (but I don't mind), and an honor and spirit that's hard to find today. Cleese's cameo is truly great and Costner is downright fun in his second over-the-top performance (Fandango being the first). Great fun and even moreso in widescreen."
1,Bad DVD version of a wonderful film...,"They tried, honestly tried to give this film the release it deserves. The problem is they managed to mess up the aspect ratio on the initial release. That's probably why this edition of the DVD has since been discontinued in favor of the extra special 2-disc edition. Amazon # B0007MAO0MOn a normal television the image appears squashed. On a widescreen TV it appears in 4:3 mode and still appears squashed. You have to manually expand it with the aspect setting on either your TV or DVD player. Either way it's unwatchable. Get the 2 disc version instead."
4,good for any person,"I'm not a fan of westerns but ""Silverado"" was a good one. It had a lot of action and it never became boring. A good movie to me is something I can watch over and over and not get bored I wouldn't mind watching it again. ""Silverado"" in my opinion had something unique to it, it had an African American and it had someone funny in it too. Not all westerns had a cowboy that was funny, they where all serious and I think that more western movies should be like ""Silverado"" in some way. Jake ( Kevin Costner ) was my favorite character and my favorite quote was said bye him too! ""All I did was kiss a girl"" I like this quote because he said it funny and it's the reason why he got in trouble. Well the sound track in the film was in my opinion to dramatic, but it wasn't to bad it fit into the movie perfect but they should tone it down just a bit. But Silverado over all was a great movie and I recommend that you at least see it once."
3,silverado review,"I did like the movie a little bit. There was to much background music, and that kind of made it boring. The sound track does help the movie because in the parts where there is action they play the music. in a movie i like to see action and comedy, even if there is a little bit of comedy it can still change the movie. the foreshadowing that i saw was when he showed the money to the cowboys. I also saw when the black cowboy came to get a drink at the bar and they didn't let him. something that makes this movie suck is that they played the music to much. What make this movie unique is that there a lot of action, and that every part of the movie falls in place , to make the movie make sence. That is my review."
1,Da Silverado,I don't like westerns cuz there is to much violence and i don't like violence.I also don't like it cuz they try to make some jokes but they weren't funny only grown up people think they are funny.I watched this movie cuz my teacher made me watch it and then write this review about it but seriously i'm not in to this kind of stuff and it doesn't call my attention. Maybe it is cuz I like movies funny comedy and scary movies. Well this all I GOTTA SAY! PEACE!Oh wait the suond track was better than the movie Liked the beat.
1,I Hate Adult Western Movies I like Cartoon Movies Better !!!,Ive never liked western movies . I did'nt like it because they tried to be funny!!! This movie made wanna fall asleep there was this movie that is a western but its cartoons it was better then Silverado!!! my only favorite western movie is Fivel Goes West !!! which is a western.its because im such a little kid cause i only like cartoon movies even though im 14 i dont real get intrested in westerns i didnt want to watch this movie but it was a school assignment so i was kind of forced to watch this movie.I dont recamend this movie to any one because if i say its a great movie id be lying to you .Its not entertaining! this movie is made for older people i recomend it to the adults not the children!!!!
1,"extremism i s good, in moderation","this movie, as a western, is worse than a john wayne b movie from the 30's.other reviewers state that the 'kasden brothers were paying homage to the traditional western genre'. no, no they weren't. they were completely lost, and should be forgiven, or forgotten.i can easily see that this movie is on a par with ed wood's movies.watching these reknowned actors (actresses) in this terrible movie begs the question: do any of them feel that this was a good movie still? or do they run for cover whenever this movie is mentioned?this movie is worth watching because it is so very bad.alvin"
2,What I Think About This Movie,"I think tnis movie sucks. The reason I think it sucks is because it boring, it did not catch my attention at all, and there were really no exiting parts in the movie that I like.If enybody were to ask me what I think about this movie I would tell them to save there money, or there time and not watch it.Personally I thought the scenes in the movie were quite not interesting.So really I think this movie sucks, and I wouldnt suggest this movie to enybody.I think they could make this movie better by changing everything."
1,silverado,"Ididn't like this movie.Ithink it sucked.It hade no comedy and it was boring.I think westrn movie's for old people.silverado was a very boring movie.The actors were ugly and there clothes are ugly & dont match,the music sucks it made the movie worse then it was then it is.It wasn't my type of movie.i've seen western movies before i never llike them.I dont recomended to nobody."
3,amazing western,The movie silverado is just another western movie. A good movie to me is a movie with a lot and alot of action and humor. i usually dont see westerns but this western movie cathed my attention because of the action in it. What i didnt really like from the movie was the soundtrack because it was to dramatic. This movie overall had a good plot. This movie is unique because ive never seen a western movie and this one was interesting
3,only for people who likes western,"i thought that the movie ''silverado'' was an alright movie. it had all of the good qualities for a good movie. it had good camera work, action, suspense, and just the right actors to play the characters. it was really tight how the four main characters met. you can tell from all the foreshadowing that they were gonna end up being friends. the soundtrack of the movie definetly made the movie a little bit better. what makes this a unique movie is the suspicion. i never expected the bad guy to be ending up as the bad guy.the quotes that i liked the most were ''this used to be a peaceful town'' and ''LETS GETEM!!!!'' i think that the movie could have been better if Emmet dies.that would have made the movie more dramatic.i would definetly recommend this movie to a person who loves western and action movies."
3,I HATE WESTERN MOVIES,"I hate western movies what makes the western movie totally suck for me is that when there is a lot of fighting going on, people are dying and also when it's too long. What I like about western movies is when people are not getting killed.What I see in the movie that makes it western are guns , cowboys, horses, american people and black people. When I first saw the foreshadowing I knew it was going to be a boring movie for me depending on a person if they like fighting movies or not. I think the soundtrack was really good it gave you hints if something bad or good is going to happen. So in the movie they treat black people badly. They don't care if they are dying, they don't where they are dying. In addition, there is a lot of shooting going on in the movie. Anyway if you ask me if Iiked the movie I did not like the movie. Maybe you will depending on you if you like ' 'WESTERN'' movies ."
2,I hate weasternz,"I don't like weasterns becuse they are always the same, a crapy showdown between 2 best friends at the end. The movie had action but the beggining was almost predictable. The movie is just like most other weasterns it gets realy old realy fast.The story some what roled on good. But it could have been better. I think there was to much emotion in this . But the soundtrack sounded real good."
2,Musical score overbearing,"I love this film...alway's have and I think Linda Hunt is great..The film score for the blu-ray release is way over done and just interrupts the story....you have to keep turning down your receiverI hate that such a fun film is like this, the only other film that has music that gets in the way is Ronin."
5,Best Western in Decades,"Start first with two convicts (Glenn and Kline), add in a young gun (Costner)and a black buffalo hunter and slaughter house worker and you have one of the more realistic Westerns ever made. Simply a pleasure to watch and the Kasdan brothers wrote a great script. The blu-ray copy isn't really all that much better than the upconverted ""Directors Cut"" DVD and unless you have a blu-ray player and 1080p TV, spend less money and be just as happy."
4,Pass the popcorn.,"A word about DVD production. Bad DVD's just happen. My particular disc came with flaws. I couldn't get rid of the French subtitles and the last fifteen minutes of sound was bad. I reported this to Amazon and they replaced my disc with a smile. No problem. They even informed me when they received the returned disc and assured me that I wouldn't be charged for the replacement. It's always a pleasure doing business with Amazon.The movie Silverado is FUN. Doesn't have a nodding acquaintance with fact or reality. A real popcorn and soda pop and chocolate Saturday afternoon Western. The music is great. I think I'll buy the sound track. The scenery is terrific. Maybe I'll visit New Mexico or Big Bend this year. The actors, including Kevin Costner, don't get in the way too much. Saddle up your Orville Ridenbacher or Paul Newman ""Real Movie Popcorn"", shut down your brain for a little while and relax. It's fun."
5,Awsome Western,"When I heard I was going to watch a western I thought I was not going to like it. I did not think I was going to like the movie because I mostly like futureristic movies. Everytime I finish watching a movie I always think to myself `` What makes this a good movie ?``. I say action and drama is what makes a good movie. This western has all of that and more.What I thought made this movie ``Silverado`` a typical western is that it has gunfights, bar fights, bank robbers, hostages, and showdowns. This movie was very exciting. I liked the soundtrack very much. I believe that the little scenes help the viewers figure out whats happenning. I would say this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. If I would recommend this movie I would to everyone I know."
4,Modern Western,This is one of the frist western movie I ever saw. This movie is a good movie if you want to see people shooting each other and bruning houses. This movie has alot of shooting in it and people getting shot ever time in the movie. This movie would of been better if it had more action. The sound track had good timeing in the movie like when there were shooting the muisc came out and it sounded great.the sound track was cool in the movie.Some of my favorite parts of the movie is mostly the shooting. The movie would of been better if they had more shooting and less talking. It was hard to predict what was going to happen next.This was one of the great western movies I have ever seen.
4,Very useless gimicky cardboard box.,"Yep, it won't close very good either. Almost a major headache to put the slip cover back on. And trust me you need to put it back on. Bad design there. They are right the scrapebook should have been designed to fit in the case. Which lacks the chapter insert. Since i own the old dvd set I simply stuck that chapter insert in the new set. Disc 2 of this set is absurd. Nothing much new. And the interview with Kevin Costner looks to be in the same room and chair and setting he used for the interview on The new Bodyguard dvd. Now I see why this is $13.99 and not more. Basically a rush job. The only reason to buy it of course though is the Superbit presentation. ;) The running commentary is a bit of a laugh though :) Loved it.They also seemed to have fixed the closed captioning. The original was just embarassingly wrong."
4,Chess Advantage 3=Chessmaster 7000,"I seen this in a store and bought it without checking out the reviews. I dont like Lego Chess, Combat Chess, Ultimate Chess, or Cyber Chess. They are just filler. But Chessmaster 7000 is very good. It has alot of good training drills and many different strength players to play against. So I feel it was a good buy. But I was unaware at the time that there were newer Chessmaster's out. So this is alitte high considering that Chessmaster 7000 is the only good game. I would recommend buying just Chessmaster 7000 by itself or a newer version if you can get it cheaper than this bundle."
5,THREE PAGES AND I WAS HOOKED!!!,"I saw the author on TV and immediately wanted to buy his book-It can be a ""handkerchief read"" at times, but Hanut compensates with a very irreverent sense of humor and a great sense of compassion and fairness-I learned a lot, cried a lot, laughed a lot- What else could we ask of a book??Highly recommended!!!"
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!,"Hanut has a unique gift of incisive analysis, unusual clarity of thinking, mature and articulate style and a miraculous capacity to synthetize creatively and imaginatively vast amounts of seemingly disparate data;I truly believe this book to be the first of a new school of writing, half way between the mundane travelogue and the vision quest This book is a small masterpiece."
5,This book is a treasure!,"A metaphysical and campy joyride through the sunbaked streets of Mexico City. Surprising, erudite, inspirational,kitsch,this treasure trove will delight anyone seeking his/her own connection to the Divine Mother of the Americas;The tradition of 'great' writing we once thought lost returns to us in this very beautiful book;"
5,Excellent!,"The author establishes a seminal argument for the true wrongs at the core of catholicism. His prose is thoughtful but spare. his work is an exemplary blend of polemic, poetry and journalism, a outrageous and furious tale. Wonderful!!!I recently spoke with Mr Hanut during one of his L.A appearances; He is a very nice and very articulate young man. A wonderful new talent and new energy to hail!"
5,F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!!!!!!!,"This is an outstanding book!Eryk Hanut brings to his work the imagination and artistry of an alchemist storyteller. His prose is clear, elegant and easy; His sense of observation is sharp but kind and never superficial, absorbing as well as intelligently sympathetic; In short, ""The Road to Guadalupe""is one of the best books I've ever read, a unique perspective on Mexico and on faith, explored with the most eloquent style>Ruth Ann Dorey"
5,David Bradley is the smartest man alive.,"It's a crime that there's only one other review of this book. David Bradley is a great non-fiction write and what's more, he is the smartest man alive. I saw him in a documentary dealing with Huck Finn and he was just insanely intelligent. He even answered the question of whether or not art is political. he is, tha baddest mutha in the world."
1,Pretentiously Racist,"I can't believe all the reviews of people gushing over this awful book. Bradley is clearly a pseudo-intellectual more intent on ""proving"" how smart he is and less on telling a story. The book is clearly anti-white without even attempting to mask it. The book never really explains why an obvious black nationalist is married to a white woman except to ""get whitey!"" The narrator admits to raping a white woman and his wife acts like it was justified? Please! The story drags and drags and then goes no where. I wasn't at all impressed with any of the characters, the evolution of the characters are nil and Bradley does WAY too much blaming every black problem on the white man. It's a tired topic and Bradley adds nothing too it."
4,Mexican Janis Joplin,"I just wanted to hear what she sounds like, given all the contoversy. I like it. Sort of a Mexican Janis Joplin."
4,Mount Downpour lives up to its name... sort of.,"Although I really like this showerhead, there are a few issues worth mentioning. First, there are only two settings, Showery downpour, which is nice, or massage, which is also good, but thats it. Nothing else. So, if you like those things which have 241 different settings, all of which are basically the same, then this one isn't going to satisfy your quest for the ultimate shower experience.The other thing is the adjustable hose could stand to be a lot longer. I am 6'3 and I needed it to be a bit more flexable.So, if you can deal with these things, then purchase away..."
5,"No longer in production, was my favorite scent.","I used this for a few years almost exclusively as my night-time cologne. It had a very dark, unique smell that people always noticed, in a good way.Sadly it's no longer being made. I felt the need to add this review in hopes they might start making it again someday."
2,Galilee hohum,I am a fan of Clive Barker but I found Galilee to be a big dissapointment. The reader was promised a firecracker ending but in the end only got a damp squib.
1,NOT FOR NIGHT-WATCHMEN OR PEOPLE OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY!!,"Cliche as it might sound....ahem....I'm a huge Barker fan. I've read and re-read nearly every novel and short story he's written, and even if I had been told prior to reading ""Galilee"" that it was a departure from from CB's usuall style, or that it was boring, I still would have read it. I usually complete a Barker novel with similar feelings to that when one returns from an exotic vacation,.... vivid memories of strange sights and customs and regret that you couldn't have stayed longer. With ""Galilee"", I found myself wondering if it would ever end."
2,"Wonderful start, but got lost somewhere in the middle","A great fan since ""Weaveworld"", Clive Barker has never disappointed me, both in his writing as in his movies. Reading the back sleeve of his latest ""Galilee"" I counted to buy his best book so far, but how wrong a person can be. After an intriguing start, a tantalizing idea about the two opposing families and promises about a possible clash of godly forces, I was left with turns in the plot, characters and storyline that almost completely put me off. Too bad that a beginning so impressive can grow so stale, and takes so many pages to do so."
1,"Slow, slow, boring, boring","This one of the fews books I coudn't finish. I've gotten through 2/3th of the book, but that was about as much as I could handle. The beginning wasn't horrible, but then it just went downhill. A weird mix of fantasy, bible, and kama sutra. Half-god jerking off a horse??? The title of my review pretty much says it all - it was very slow, very boring, and pretty tastless (no, I am not a prude, but the book was tasteless nontheless). This was the first Clive Barker's book that I've read, and I probably won't try another one for a while."
1,This book stinks!,"I was somewhat interested in the first few chapters of the book. I soon realized, however, that the book was going absolutely nowhere, fast. None of the characters were developed at all, I saw all of them as predictible and boring. Rachel and Galilee the worst! I was not convinced of the Geery evil in the least..."
1,A poor attempt to move from his field,"Clive Barker has amazed us with WeaveWorld and Everville. His charcters are rich and involving. Every book so far has been an occasion to take the week-end off and spend 48 hours in suspense and awe. What happened here? Seems that Mr. Barker has gone the way of Stephen King. Once a great master, King has lost his touch of affecting our psyche and making us look over our shoulders at night. Barker had that same affect until Galilee. Great horror novelist should avoid the romance novel and stay with there art, scaring the hell out of the reader. I hope that Barkers recent trend with Sacrifice and Galilee is not the end of another great horror writer and the beginning of another Stephen King ""Insomnia,"" or ""Rose Matter."""
2,"Sexy, but not very special","To be fair, I don't think anything could live up to IMAJICA, one of the best fantastic novels ever. It's got great sex, but there's no grand passion. It has magical beings, but no real magic. I finished it, but it left me lukewarm."
5,magical realism meets the southern gothic,"Yet another testament to this man's genius. Mr. Barker should once again be applauded for his continuing evoulution as an artist. He has taken the gothic romance into new forays of surrealism and decadence that blend together in a sugary darkness that is all his own. Clive Barker should be listed with the ranks of Rushdie and Pynchon not the other hacks he's continuously lumped in with. For all those whiners concerned about this not being horror enough stick to heavy metal and Koontz and leave the ""literature"" for adults."
4,"Well written, but at times a little disappointing","I have enjoyed many of Clive Barkers Books in the past and I think he is an extremely skilled writer. I thought Galilee was written exceptionally well, but I believe the ending was a little dispointing, and was a bit of an anti climax. i enjoyed the style of the writing and it was exciting to read. But I felt that the ending did let it down."
1,Bizarre,"I would give this novel a zero if I could. It has no redeemingqualities. The story is a hallucinogenic nightmare of cliches,predictable (boring) characters and the requisite orgy scenes mentioned in passing.Another reviewer correctly summed it up as a cross between X-Files and a soap opera. Add a dash of salacious talk show and you've got the plot.Pure drivel."
2,Clive Barker in Anne Rice Territory,"Sad to say, this one is a clinker. Mr. Barker has taken on a subject that would better suit Anne Rice's prose style and her temperament. This simply is a silly book, inflated, badly structured, and, finally, dull. Clive Barker is a far better writer and a more clever deviser of plots than Ms. Rice, but this reads like one of her lesser efforts. It was a real disappointment."
2,Had to put it down,"I don't understand the 5-star reviews of this novel. I've read everything that Mr. Barker has written and continue to buy his novels as soon as they are released, which may have been a mistake this time. After 250 pages, I still feel that the story hasn't gotten anywhere. I've hung in as long as I can. Galilee will go back on the bookshelf until I run out of things to read. I hope Mr. Barker reads his readers comments, and if so, I offer this...your imagination is far too vivid and your talent far too large to have wasted the time of both yourself and your readers with this."
5,Amazing Story,"Clive Barker does it again! Another book that you do not want to end. Unfotunately it does, but the end is left open to a sequel."
5,An amazing trip for the mind and the soul...,An amazing tale that spans the imagination. Looking forward to more from Mr. Barker as always!
2,Barbara lives on,"I read Imajica (both volumes) last year, and I must say I was gobsmacked by the sheer brilliance of Barker's narrative and imagination. So I started reading Barker's Galilee with relish, expecting an intriguing and fascinating tale of mysterious gods and goddesses, etc. But, woh! After some 200 hundred pages, it felt like I was fourteen again, reading my daily Mills & Boon paperback! I mean, the Rachel character was just soooo predictable and how on earth did Galilee decide she must be the one and only after sooo many (women...and men...and children...)? Nope, your standard Barbara Cartland yarn here: from rags to riches lass finds out her handsome John John Kennedy look-alike husband has somehow turned into a monster, but fortunately is bedded by the super-endowed Galilee who whisks her off (eventually...) to his ""kingdom"". Boring....and Barker must definitely have a sequel in mind....."
2,Dallas meets the Munsters,"The Geary family are a bore. I think Barker's been watching too many soap operas because this book is a snooze. Does he really expect us to care about these characters? They're rich, good looking snobs. I'm supposed to get all teary because some billionare has a bout of diherrea? Poor little Rachael was told not to swear in bed. Awwww life's just not worth living. This is weak stuff."
3,Barker takes a different path,"Clive Barker's books tell a lot about the man himself. Most of his books explain his own personal philosophies in one way or another, and Galilee is no exception. An epic novel detailing the anguish and love of two families entwined by fate and by action, Galilee expresses Barker's personal visions in a languid and less graphic manner than Weaveworld or The Great and Secret Show, a style that sets it apart from his previous novels. The tale is told by an observer this time, and not by the novel's main character Galilee, and takes many pauses and meanderings which come together in the end. The style is almost more Victoria Andrews than Clive Barker, but it is still engaging and thought-provoking, and still makes obvious his own thoughts on life, if you can read between the lines. It is clearly apparant that Barker has written this novel with a movie in mind, and with a little luck he will get this beautiful story turned into a film that does it justice."
2,Not what I had hoped...<yawn!>,"Unfortunately, this was my first Clive Barker novel and it was less than I had hoped it would be. Although Mr. Barker can paint some pretty images with his poetic words, GALILEE really left me wondering what the point was. I suppose not being a romance fan didn't help either..."
1,A poor attempt at romance without the fantasy I expected.,"If you want romance, you'll have to wade through three quarters of this disappointment for one erotic moment. The only other image that sticks in my mind was the description of a fellow who ""mined"" something from his nose a flicked it away. Except for those ""highlights,"" I'm sorry I kept with it. Hey Clive, stick to the Weaveworld theme!"
2,Not Clive's best...,"While this book was interesting and engaging, it was too long for its story. This story, I believe, would have been great with about a quarter of the story cut out!!! And the end was really not that well done or creative. You expect a lot more and get less. Read Imijica or Everville. These are his BEST works..."
2,Whatever,"Difficult reading. Unfocused. Parts of the book were very good but in the end, it left me feeling somewhere between wanting more and being happy it was finally over, like feeling nothing. Sort of like this review... *usually Clive Barker is The Greatest but not this time*"
2,The never ending story,"This is my first Clive Barker book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought the book started out great, with interesting characters and a mystery about the relationship between the families. It really bogged down in the middle, and seemed to drag on and on. But I stuck with it to find get to the good finish that I thought was there. Well, it never arrived. The last two thirds of the book never lived up to the build up. The mysteries of the past were briefly commented on but never really explained. I guess this means a sequel, but I won't read it."
1,Out of his genre.,"Clive Barker writes excellent thrillers, but with ""Galilee"" he is out of his element. I optimistically plowed through 400 pages before giving up, but the book was just too slow-moving, lackluster, and ultimately insignificant. I have no curiosity at all about what happens in the last 236 pages - that says it all."
1,Tragic,"I share the dissapointment of us all who disliked this book. Let me say only this: I never give up on a book I started so I finished it and than immediately took it to a local secondhand bookstore and sold it for 1 EURO. I only got this much because the guy liked the cover art. That's all to say...Barker is really a great artist! He should have started ABARAT some years ago and skip this ""I have to write something with lots of love and so, 'coz my publisher orderd me seeing the success of James Cameron's Titanic!""BmanHungary"
2,A Let Down For Barker Fans,"In the times of Cabal, Weaveworld, Imajica, The Thief Of Always, and The Books of the Art Barker was one of the best author's of his time. Galilee is a complete letdown for all of us and a softie for someone like Barker. Along with Sacrament these are his two ""mushy books"" and I myself dont recommend them."
4,Clive Barker ROCKS!,"Galilee uses the writer within the story technique that Stephen King has been using with some frequency of late (Green Mile for instance). Barker uses this to meld together what is essentially an historical fiction novel with the modern time resurgence of the narrator. Personally I don't care if Barker is writing romance, horror, or fantasy... he is brilliant. This novel surely had more of an Anne Rice flavor than any to date, but I still enjoyed it greatly. Not really getting to the climax at the end is my only strong reservation, but having just spotted the release date for G2 I hold judgement (with much anticipation)."
1,What happened to the king of horror?,"Clive has long been my favorite fiction author, I really hope this book turns out to be the product of a ""slump"", as opposed to being a new direction. This book moves along with all the speed of continental drift, it is drawn out, and simply boring. It reads like the classic ""boy meets girl"" story, with a bit of the supernatural thrown in. If your looking for something similiar to Imajica, Great and Seceret Show, or Weaveworld, your bound to be dissapointed. The only other work of Clive's I could relatively compare this with would be Sacrament, which I found to be rather thin."
2,Much Too Much of a Good Thing = Overkill,"A promising start reminding me of the classic gothic novel, the story line begins to unravel in psychotic episodes supposedly experienced by the character/author. I could just imagine Barker saying to himself ""Gee, can't figure out where this is going so let's be truthful and let the author say he's loosing his ability to tell this story."" This leaves the reader feeling manipulated and foolish to continue reading hoping that something would at some point ""come together."" Being a true fan, I stuck it out but was disappointed in the queasy kissy face ending."
2,Swedish fan #1,Ther's a certain pattern when I look around among the reviews. All the girls seem to enjoy the plot when the boys find it ridicoulus. Because I'm on of the latter I don't find the book very good though it had its moments. We know you can do better Mr Barker (sorry girls).
5,thumbs up,"An interesting page-turner that had me guessing what would happen next. Had to fight myself between this and Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE, since I was reading them both at the same time. That's saying something about GALILEE"
3,"A grand story with promise, but doesn't deliver the goods.","Clive has sort of gone out on a limb in creating this novel. He is more than capable of writing a romance book, but I don't get the endearing passion between the two main characters, Galilee and Rachel...I think that its a allusion sort of to the late Princess Diana marrying into the Royal Family and being less enthralled in the rigors of the regal life that was expected of her. The Gearys clan seem to be underdeveloped in that their actions doesn't seem plausible to me, especially Mitchell...Clive needs a greater infusion of horror lurking under the surface of the story also. A nice attempt though Clive"
2,Disappointing - especially for a Barker book.,"The master of horror and oddly fantastic worlds has underdone himself with Galilee. It is a fasinating story of two warring families that leads the reader into thinking that there is going to be a catastrophic battle, all in the name of love. The story drags on and on with promisses of war, death and destruction but to which none ever happens. The book is filled with all sorts of information, past and present, and takes the reader through the ages of time but does little in what we expect to happen. I was hooked for the first half of the book but then I just wanted to finish it. Read it if you are a Barker fan but be forewarned that it is NOT what you are used to. It could have been condensed and made shorter and I think the author ran out of material to work with in the end. I would compare this novel to Rose Madder by Stephen King but Rose Madder is a better read."
4,A commendable Title,"I really am entertained when I read Clive Barker- the worlds he creats are often whole and unto themselves. However, this is not horror. Compared to his first offering, The Books of Blood, this is tame. Regardless, his perfection of lyricism is always apparent in whatever he writes. Overall, he will impress you with his scope and vision in this novel- you may well find yourself completly immersed in the damn thing! If you are a fan of talent, I recomend it. When you close the last page, you will still resound with the events and images contained inside its covers. A good read from an exellent author to any thoughtfull reader!"
5,Globe Master Sun Glasses,Great quality unfortunately it just didn't fit. The best part though was it was not a problem to return this item for a full refund. Thanks.
5,The Aviator,"So short of actually becoming an Air Force Officer and Pilot, this is about the coolest thing you could do for yourself. Nothing says don't mess with the best like these Aviators, and while AO might not have the best rep in the aviator market think about this. . . what do the Thunderbirds wear? Enough said."
5,Great sunglasses for the price,"These are great sunglasses for the price. Made in the USA, real glass lenses, American Optics has a military contract so these are the real deal. Classic, timeless style.They are a bit heavy, but you get used to that. Also, it would be of benefit to have them professional adjusted at your local optician. Most of them will do this for you for free. This will result in a better fit for you as not everyone's face is the same.The nearest competitor is Randolph Engineering sunglasses. Those are also very good but they cost like three times as much so I'm not sure that they are any better for the money.I do wish these had a earloop rather than bayonet straight design as the bayonet doesn't seem to fit as well for me. But this is a minor complaint given the price paid."
5,"A bit heavy, but highly recommended","Good quality sunglasses for males or females at a reasonable price. Glasses seem a bit heavy, but this is the first pair of sunglasses I have had that have glass lenses and a good quality frame so I don't have anything to compare them to."
5,Excellent Vendor,Item was well priced and exactly as advertised. It arrived quickly and well packed. Good buying experience.
3,Not dark enough and too big,They are too big for my face and are not dark enough. Also when I wear them on my bike they channel wind directly to the inside of my eye and make them water.
3,"Nice quality, bad choice of style","Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these glasses, though if I purchased again I would not get the bayonet style, they are frequently slipping down the bridge of my nose. Pretty annoying actually, but I suppose its my fault for choosing this style."
2,Not a fan,"Ive been using cheap wrap around style amber lenses in the cockpit for the past few years and they work pretty well. I decided to fork over a little more money for these, and I just care for them. They are flat across the eyes which leave the sides wide open causing glare from behind. The grey lenses are decent for bright days, especially up in the flight levels. As soon as you get under partly cloudy sky, everything is too dark, especially the cockpit. They don't seem to offer any haze penetration either. In the first week I got big scratch on them. Other than that, the construction feels decent and the flat ear pieces fit well under the headset."
4,Great glasses at a great price,These are great sunglasses. The optics are really good and the construction is solid. And you can't beat the look. Some may find them a tad on the heavy side due to the use of real glass but I like the solid feel. I was concerned that they aren't polarized but so far it hasn't been an issue. I have a smaller face and have trouble finding a good fit. The American Optical's in the 52mm are perfect for me. The case they come with is nice. Nothing fancy but it does the job. I do wish they came with a cleaning cloth but that's a minor complaint.
5,Fantastic sunglasses!,"I ordered these after a friend who is a pilot loaned me his. I wanted glasses that had a military aviator look without the price tag of the fancy designer brands. I couldn't be more pleased. The temples flex but are a snug fit, the black frames look great with the gray lens, and the optical quality is excellent both outdoors in direct sunlight and in the car driving. I have owned everything from Ray Bans to Prada, and of all the sunglasses I have had, these are the best. Cannot beat the price, and the look. A definite winner!"
2,Most tracks seem unfinished,"Tony Levin is clearly a talented bass guitarist with the soul of a true progressive rock artist. This album, while conveying this talent and soul, unfortunately falls short in terms of giving the listener a full fledged, finished product with most of the tunes. It's like a handful of rough studio mixes and jam session recordings were suddenly deemed good enough to release. Every track shows promise but many could use editing and tweaking of some sort. This CD goes in my car for background driving music as a rhythmically interesting album, but it's not for living room, bedroom, or party listening."
4,Anything He Touches is Good!,"This record is growing on me everyday. There is nothing radically different about this prog rock record, but it is solid, well written and performed and sufficiently powerful. Best tune is ""The Fifth Man"". The writing is very good. The players on the record are all top-notch. This is prog rock that is niether dark nor bright. Extremely well executed! It as something on it for everybody that respects Tony Levin's work` or prog rock in general, Very little vocals. Great spin!"
5,Playing nonstop,"I have been playing this cd nonstop since it arrived from Amazon the other day. The Tony Levin Band is playing live in a nearby city, in a few days, and I just wanted to be familiar with the songs they are going to perform. This cd rocks, with heavy prog style basslines, and soft, sublte moments that fit together perfectly. ""Tequila"", ""Aquafin"", and ""Ooze"" are my favorites at the moment. Any fan of Tony Levin's should enjoy this cd, and try to see them live if they come near your town."
4,A great family kayak,"I own this Kayak. It was given to me as a gift and purchased on Amazon. I use it for rowing on midwestern lakes with both my 9-year old son, and solo. It points well, thanks to the little skeg in the back, and it's light enough for me to load and unload from the roof of my van single handed.I have only noticed two drawbacks after a full summer of use. The seat backs are ""hinged"" by a light bendable metal that are destined to break with time. I like to turtle my kayak on the roof of my van, and that requires punching the seats down into a horizontal position--so as I mentioned, it's only a matter of time before the thin metal strips falter. The other concern is that the boat only has webbing on the rear deck and not on the front. I plan to address this with an after market kit. That's my winter project....All things considered, it's a great little boat, a great source of enjoyment for my family and I, and deserving of recommedation."
5,Skull vale covers,These little guys look badass. They are easy to install. Twist off the old ones and twist these on. It that easy and look great.
5,way cool,"awesome look on my Corvette!nice quality, great price.easy to put on, am I skull, skeleton freak, for most everything..very cool!"
4,Love them,"I love these,they look great on my car.i would tell anyone to get these.They are great gifts for birthday or christmas"
5,Cpas,My old man is going to love this. It was here sooner than said. Product was not scratched and brand new.
2,Not what I expected.,"When I received this item I was a little disappointed. The plastic molding wasn't the best, but you can't expect chrome for the price. They look ok from 5 ft away. Not all that amused with red eye sockets."
5,"""Skull's Stuff"" Is Good!","I purchased other ""Skull"" stuff for My truck and these Valve caps fit right in. Good quality and good Amazon Vendor-looking for more add on options, Amazon let's me know what's out there on my Amazon recomendations page-all's good!"
2,"Blunt ""Blade""","I'm a sucker for Asian cinema but ""The Princess Blade"" doesn't cut it. Set in a corrupt, futuristic Japan, young Yuki leaves her assasin gang to discover her royal roots as a princess.Don't let gravity defying martial arts (simillar that of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") and the sword slashing gore-factor (simillar to that of ""Kill Bill vol.1"") fool you. The bullet-dodging scene in the beginning is worth a peak but I suggest hitting the stop button after that."
1,Waste of my money.,"This movie was absolutely horrible.The action is cheesy and not even remotely well choreogeraphed. There are a few decent moments mixed in with a whole lot of junk.The plot takes up the middle third of the movie, and it's a total joke... I could forgive the crap plot - if it were just an outline supporting the violence. But when you consider that the action isn't worth a dollar to watch, the plot suddenly comes more into focus.Don't waste your money."
4,very pleased,"Much better than most female hero movies. I appreciated the fact that the romance wasn't the main point of the story, in fact it was quite understated. The action scenes were short but well worth it... alot of the ending moves were brilliant and unlike anything i've seen. Any talk of a sequel? How about Princess Blade vs. Kill Bill?"
4,Terrific action film with sublime fight choreography...,"In a dark future where Japan is once again under the rule of an emperor who often seeks the help of the Takemikazuchi clan as hired assassins to help control probable resistance. Yuki, a devoted assassin, has been raised by the clan from early childhood and she finds out that the clan leader, Byakurai, killed her mother when she was just a child. Angry and motivated Yuki seeks out Byakurai in order to carry out her revenge, but he is too powerful for her and she must escape. In Yuki's getaway she crosses paths with Takashi who works for the rebel forces. Takashi is suspicious of Yuki's motives, but it soon appears to Takashi that she is not sent to kill him. Princess Blade is an action packed love story that attacks the audience's attention with sublime fight choreography as it offers a good cinematic experience."
4,"More, More...","They could of done so much with this one, the story line and all the characters - or maybe I just been viewing this from a directors chair, its a cool kung fu flick"
4,Unexpected Pleasure,"At first I was very critical while watching this film; the quality of the picture; the acting; the camera work during the action scenes. But then something happened, I started to care about the main character. Then, even when I felt the action scenes could've been shot better, I got involved in them. I ended up really liking this film. It is slow in parts, but just to develop a story. I was surprised over all. I think it is worth renting."
3,"Worthy, Yet Overhyped, Effort","After checking out this movie from hearing so much about it, I definitely had to say that this movie was okay. The movie felt very professional and had a lot of potential, but in the end it seemed forcelly chopped up and incomplete. I really wished this movie went into a lot more detail and filled in some of its plot holes. If you're an Asian cinema fan, it's worth a look. I would highly recommend a very similar, yet more complete and superior, Japanese flick called ""Azumi"" by Kitamura, which came out around the same time."
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH,I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie. It seemed very empty to me! The fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me...maybe if it was longer it would have been better? I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!! sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie.
2,This movie was a major let down,"Acouple years ago there was a Asian Film Festival in Philadelphia. One of the films playing at that festival was Princess Blade. However I missed the screening and was very upset. When I was finally able to purchase the DVD release of the film I was very excited. However after viewing the film I was very disapointed. The main problem I had was that the heroine is not a believeable asassin, during the action it seems like she can barely hold onto the sword. The film is not very well acted and this does take away from character development. There are a few fights in the film that were somewhat entertaining. That is why I gave the film 2 stars, overall I did not enjoy the movie at all."
3,Earth Angel,"I really enjoyed the book. Unfortunately it really didnt go into explaining a whole lot about the ""dabblers"" group. After hearing about Earth Angels at a siminar I was really intrigued and drawn to the book. I was extrememly interested in finding my niche because I have never really fit in. After finding that my group was the dabblers I was so excited to learn more only to find out there was VERY VERY little info. The book does cover the other types of Angels very well though. Guess when you buy the book you have to just hope you are not part of the dabbler group. Dabblers will remain lost."
3,twinkie and shallow,"This book has some interesting notions but it is very much in the fuzzy pink unicorn class of 'new age' books. For example her concept of 'fairies' seems to come from Disney cartoons rather than the awesome and formidable Sidhe of folklore and Craft teaching and experience. There is no depth here, no grit in any of the sections. All just too aerie la-la for me, but it does raise some interesting issues and is not expensive so what the hey. Enjoy it for what it is without expecting it to be more."
5,THE book if you're questioning!,"If you've ever had even the slightest interest in this subject, if you've ever had the slightest doubts about your own heritage...this is the book to read. It won't give you all the answers, but it helps you realize your own.This book is small, simple, and not detailed at all. And because of that, it's everything you need when you don't want to plough through a hundred textbooks looking for answers."
3,Some of this is elsewhere. A rehash.,"Okay, so I figured out I was an angel and star person hybrid. That was useful, I guess. This book will definitely help you identify yourself. You won't feel so different as you know that there are other people out there like you - that's comforting. I appreciate how Doreen puts it all together, but honestly, most of the book is old information from other books that she's written. She just made the information gel. You'd figure it out if you've followed her as long as I have, especially if you listen to her show on HayHouseRadio."
3,Wish it was more detailed,"I enjoyed this book, but it is a very small book and I found myself unsure whether I was an incarnated angel or not. I had most of the characteristics but not all. Although she has a little quiz, I didn't find it very helpful. I don't understand why instead of making two small books without very much information, she didn't just make one large book with more information."
3,Calling all aliens,"While I feel Virtue made a great attempt to give insight into the reasons why those of us who do not ground into Earth energy very well, describing our Other energetic origins, this book leaves a lot to be desired. Aspects of it seem to present a pretty picture, and don't focus on the full scope of what it means to find balance between being in a form, yet feeling spiritually drawn to other stellar homes. This book makes into a very broad stroke layers of strata that can't, and really shouldn't attempt to be summed up in a pocket guide."
5,I love this book.,I really enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it to others!Also check out this novel: Angel Lover by Cynthia Cody
3,",","Essentially this is a short hand overview of otherkin ideology. Not a bad book if you are within the community; but if you aren't it'll leave you a little baffled. The book isn't so old that the mention of the community should have just been overlooked either, so I wonder about that."
5,Amazing author,It is great to finally find someone who writes about all the subjects that I have know about and have experienced first hand. All of her books are very uplifting and informative. We often tend to believe that there is nothing more than meets the eye and nothing is further from the truth. I have since purchased another three of her books.
2,Earth Angels... ?,"I read this book about four years ago and boy, what a trip now looking at it again. It is nice to think about but I wouldn't take it too seriously. Some nice ideas but read it to make up your own mind. Don't bother buying brand new."
5,"""TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT' Hemingway","A film that gave Hoffman his first Oscar and Streep the first of her record 13 Oscar nominations. Just promoted to a high ranking advertising position, Hoffman arrives home to find Streep packed and moving out,leaving son Henry behind with daddy. One can sense what's been going on; the old story of a ""wired"" father spending too much time at work, and a mother who ""needs to find herself"". She does so, spending 15 months in California, seeing a shrink, and landing a lucrative job. Meanwhile, back at the ranch in New York, Hoffman has nobly been doing ""double duty"", bonding well with his son, although the stress finally catches up with him. When he loses a vital account, he's fired by his best friend. At the same time, Streep reappears and sues Hoffman for custody.Welcome to the Alamo circa 1836.The final 20 minutes are too absorbing to describe, so get hold of a copy and see what you missed almost 30 years ago."
5,Sensitive portrait of divorce.,"Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep is the best film of the '70s to win best picture. This is one of those films that have a heart, soul, and incredible acting from both of its leads. To me, this is Hoffman's best performance, he plays the husband whose wife has just walked out and left their son behind, Hoffman plays the character so real and gutsy. Streep plays a not so nice person but you learn later on in the film the reasons why she had to leave and start a new life for herself. I highly recommend Kramer vs. Kramer, this is a must for any media collection. Enjoy!"
1,1 star NOT for the movie,Is there any chance the movie studio will get a clue and reduce their list price?! DVDs are cheaper now...wake up already. This DVD has been out going on 3 years now. It's time to slash and burn the prices.
1,Typical 70's trash,"We thought that we would be safe renting a PG movie, but true to 70's form, it should have been rated R! They show a woman completely nude! The description says that it is a movie about family values, but it is the furthest from family values. It portrays a woman leaving her son and husband behind because she ""isn't happy"", and proceeds to show the husband sleeping around. Definitely not a family movie by any standards."
2,Awful twaddle,"This won a load of Oscars. Why? This is as bad as ""Ordainary People"". I don't want to see movies about ordainary people and their rather sad and meaningless lives. I don't want to see ""worthy"" dramas about divorce. I don't want to see the effect of divorce on ""cute"" children. Heck I don't want to really see children in movies at all."
1,Garbage,"One Word: Overrated.In 1979, there were many wonderful films to watch like Apocalypse Now.This, however, is not one of them."
5,Blu-Ray Kramer,"Great! One of my favorite movies and looks great. The interviews at the end, too, are AWESOME. Really really good. It was fascinating hearing Dustin, Meryl and the producer and director talk about so many things! It turns out Dustin Hoffman basically helped re-write it. They wanted to give him a writing credit and he refused. He was getting a divorce so so much of it was from his own experiences."
3,We've come a long way,"I saw Kramer vs Kramer in DVD a few days ago and thougth that it didn't age very well. The first part is a flawless drama about how the perfect yuppie life changed to Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), after his wife decided to leave him with their small son Billy (Justin Henry) so she can find herself.Hoffman is wonderful: charming, vulnerable; the kid is cute an cries like a pro, and Meryl Streep is perfect as the unhappy young mother. New York City is beautiful and it's easy to emphasize with the dilemmas of mother, father and child; but when it comes to the part when it becames a courtroom drama, the argument of each lawyer are weak: Joanna won't be a fit mother because she has a demanding job, and Ted won't be a fit father because he sacrificed his lucrative job to care for his child.After seeing Kramer vs Kramer and the way they supossed to deal in the late 70's with child custody, as Virgina Slims would have said: "" We've come a long way, baby""."
2,Five Oscars for this peace of fluff?,The voters must have been on drugs or paid off to vote this run of the mill movie 5 Oscars. Dustin Hoffman's performance pails compared to Roy Scheider's in All That Jazz. Kramer vs. Kramer over Apocalypse Now for Best Picture? Director Oscar to Robert Benton over Francis Coppola for Apocalypse Now and Bob Fosse for All That Jazz?
2,Tear jerker,I will be the only one not to rave about it. Somebody explains to me: Is it Cinema or TV Soap????..
4,1979. Oh yeah.,"So divorce and child custody were huge issues in 1979. Hee haw. I think the bigger, more timely issue that plays out in KvK is Hoffman's insensitivity to Streep's wish to live a more fulfilling and well rounded life. At first it's hard to get drawn into Streep's perspective, especially with the Adam Rich clone making cute with Daddy Kramer. You start off thinking, ""How could she just up and leave that little muppet? Bad mommy!"" Some may question the Streep Best Support Actress deal, but her courtroom performance in the last act fills in the gaps and you can finally empathize with her.I don't like the tacked on last scene. It kills it."
2,Double standards aren't anything new,"I saw this film when it first came out and I must say what must have made it Oscar material was the subject matter - not the story. We see here the seeds of the downfall of the boomer generation as well as the usual double standards in play.Let's get this right -- Streep's character mothers her son for 5 years but somehow that is not as wonderful as Hoffman's 18 month investment? Somehow his shorter time ""counts for more."" Streep leaves for 18 months but somehow that is ""more"" than Hoffman's abandonment of his family emotionally for 6 years? This is the same thinking behind now calling actresses ""actors"" because that ""means more.""Please - I don't know how Meryl played that part with a straight face. And of course HER best friend of 6 years supports him not her! It's interesting that whenever women take a step forward - the men always have to compensate. The court scene was RIDICULOUS in its stupidity and lack of believability. Next please!"
5,Touching,"The child did the best acting, although the parents were great,too. The film reflects the societal phenomenon of increased rate of divorce in the U.S (when the film was made). Of course not to say every divorce is bad, but the film surely reminds the viewer the value and warmth of a family."
3,"Yea, a little too difficult","I mainly bought this book because I was so impressed with all the figures. After receiving this, I don't think I will ever be able to use this book. Everything is way too complex."
5,Easy clay characters,The instructions are very easy to follow and I have been able to create wonderful characters to the amazement of my friends and family.
4,Perfect Student Edition,"The Folger Libray edition is very useful for students who are unfamiliar with Elizabethan language, customs, and other oddities. The opposite page of the script acts as prompter, dictionary, and general explainer. My students found the edition easy to use and helpful."
5,My Favorite of All of Shakespeare,"This drama is my favorite of all of Shakespeare's plays. I love Shakespeare's humor, and I actually have found myself literally laughing out loud at the wry humor of the main character Hamlet. But, I'm not a person who usually enjoys books that fall into the ""classics"" genre. So that just shows how fantastic this drama is. Once you get used to the language, this is a quick read that is very enjoyable and I find myself going back to over an over. Shakespeare was a genius playwright!"
3,Hamlet,"I decided to finally write reviews for all my past purchases from Amazon just so I can be fair and return the favor to other people. This apparently was the first item I bought from Amazon. Don't remember what I paid for it exactly from the screen that I'm in now, but I probably didn't pay much for it. Anyways, it's a good book to have from a classic-story point of view. It's only $6 with free shipping from Prime, so it's a bargain if I've ever seen one."
5,Art as its finest.,"One of the great feats of human imagination, Hamlet is one of the most complex, perspicacious, and aesthetically brilliant examples of literature, and this is a great edition."
4,A truly BLOODY play,"""Hamlet"" is considered, by some, to be Shakespeare's best work. I am not of that school of thought. I've read it. I've watched it played on a stage. I've watched a movie or two based on it. It could be better.Hamlet (the character) has problems. Apparently, his step-father killed his father. This obsesses Hamlet, who,also, is depressed, manic, neurotic, and fearful. Still, count up the dead bodies that accumulate during the play!One of the problems with the play is the ""play-within-a-play"" that goes on for too long. The complete Hamlet can play for over four hours, which is not good for business. Fantastic directors usually manage to get it done in under three hours. Usually, 10% or more of the lines get chopped. The play still drags. Also, usually, someone much too old plays Hamlet. Hamlet should be played by a 16 to 18 year old. So, it is easy to go wrong with this play.Nevertheless, this play fascinates us, all. Do not be satisfied with only one version of this play."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when I received this book. I know I ordered a ""used"" book, but there is writing on almost every page--all over the page. What's more, whatever is written in the book doesn't even pertain to the play at all. Just some high schooler's to-do lists and even a page covered in purple stars and hearts. In addition to the writing, there were sticky notes everywhere that were marking who knows what, and the book in general was in poor condition. Frankly, I am embarrassed to even read this in public. If I find a cheaper one somewhere else I will buy that and toss this one."
3,Shakespeare is Shakespeare,"Teacher said this was required reading. As far as I can tell, it's true to The Bard's style and penchant for requiring 10-15 minutes per page to read. For me, pure homework."
2,overused,even though I bought a used addition . the book was extremely man handled and over used. I will be more careful next time when buying used.
1,I've heard better from Mark Chesnutt - Not impressed at all.,"And to top it off, an Aerosmith cover? Gimme a break. Yet another country singer, picked by the Powers That Be in Nashville, to try crossover songs. Leave rock to rockers, and keep country in country.You know what? Hank Williams Sr. would have never done an Aerosmith song. You know why? He wrote his OWN DAMN SONGS!Anyways, I like alot of the other music Mr. Chesnutt has done. This one is just plain bland. Not enough taste for my Cajun buds. And kinda weak. I'll leave it for those who like it."
5,Lo mas grande,"Creo que esto es la mas grande recopilación de Miguel Mateos, faltandolé solo el tema ""Perdiendo el Control"" que es el mejor tema compuesto por él."
2,tepid rehash of old materials.......,"If you're looking for new materials, do not bother with this release. It is a loose grouping of old cartoons. While the cartoons are in themselves excellent, no new value has been added by the new animated linkages. Imagine if you would a nightclub operated by Mickey. On halloween, all of the classic villains arrive to watch cartoons. Then Mickey has a bit of a struggle and the show's ended.I am afraid that this release is all too typical of the recent Disney animated sequels. The characters are great, the animation good, but the plots are rotten. Disney is in danger of damaging its reputation. Please, Disney. Come up with some good plots!!"
2,"Another ""cheapie"" is right!","I waited months for this DVD to come out, thinking that maybe Disney would begin to realize the demand for more villain entertainment. I was really disappointed. There were a few really old cartoons that I had not seen since I was a kid but other than that, it was really cheesy with no real story or anything inventive. They basically slapped together some old toons and put a new label on it."
4,Good fun!!,"My 4 yr old daughter loves this! I was worried that the ""villains"" theme might scare her, but it's only lighthearted fun. I don't have all the shorts that people are complaining about here, so it's a treat for me not only to have them all on one video but also it's a good prelude to Halloween next month."
2,Not at all what I expected,"When I got this, I expected to see one big story with interesting plot twists. Instead, it's just a bunch of Disney shorts mixed together. It doesn't focus on the whole ""House of Villains"" thing at all, in fact, for half of the film I'm wondering ""when the heck is this thing even going to really start?"". It ends with one of the dumbest battles ever. Basically, Mickey takes a lamp and [draws] Jafar into it, and all of the other villains scream and run. Hello? I'm pretty sure that all of them combined are much more dangerous than Mickey, even without Jafar. It barely even focuses on the villains at all, giving them maybe 5% of the entire screen time."
1,Mickey's House of Villians,Villain's? Beware! It's a good thing for the adult crowd that Disney has guaranteed your satisfaction or your money back. I'm very disappointed in the program. I expected to see more villainous action instead of the sleepy new and old restored footage put together in this remarkably boring DVD and Video.
5,Autistic grandson watches continually,I cannot review the contents of this video. I purchased it for my autistic grandson who had worn out the same film on VHS and requested one on DVD. His mother tells me he took it right to his room to begin watching it as the VHS had broken some time ago and he was really missing it. All I know of it is the kid really likes it.
4,Entertaining and a great addition to your Halloween Holiday movie collection!,"Anyone familiar with Mickey's House of Mouse will recognize the formula for this movie. The villians come into the House of Mouse and everyone is treated to Halloween movies, until the time comes for the villians to take over Mickey's place! While some of the vignettes aren't really Halloween oriented they are still enjoyable, and certainly the addtion of such classics as: ""Trick or Treat"" and ""Lonesome Ghosts"" will be a joy for any true Diseny Fan. Some parts might be a little scary for sensitive or small children, but otherwise it is a lighthearted entertaining Halloween Treat!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I expected a little more out of Disney, but with their track record lately, I don't know why I was surprised at their lack of creativity. I thought this would be more centered around the villians trying to take over the ""House of Mouse"", but instead it was mostly old Disney cartoons with small clips of the villians plotting a take over in between. Definately NOT a DVD worth buying. My son begged me to purchase it, but I rented instead. My daughter, who was 7 year old at the time, was terribly bored throughout the movie. The only reason I rated it with 2 stars instead of just 1 was because my 6 year old son enjoyed it, however he has expressed absolutely NO interest at all in seeing it again. If you really want to see it, go for it, but I advise you to rent it first before buying."
2,Not as good as it should be,"Read this review before purchasing this product. When I saw the trailer for it I was very excited. The trailer had all the villains but they were shots from the original movies. I personily love the villains, lets face it there the best! I thought if it was as good as the original movies I would love it, but sad to say it does not compare to any classic disney movie. Most of the time it was just old and new cartoons that were pretty boring. My favorite villain Maleficent had only one, I repeat ONE line in the whole movie! You may like this film, or you may not. I would advise that you rent it before atcually buy it."
4,Fun for kids,"This is probably more for kids...my daughter (5) loves it. It's a nice assortment of different cartoons with a Halloween theme. It's not very scary or suspenseful, though, just fun."
1,Quite a Jip,"What has been promoted as an all out battle between the Disney good and evil is merely a cable Halloween special with a hefty price tag. Overly laden with the old ""classic"" halloween cartoons that are replayed every october and new (mildly to little entertaining) strips written just for the show there is very little plot. It is true that in the beginning Mickey is in control and then Jafar kicks him out, and later they try to ""out Magic"" eachother in a final ""battle."" However the entire plot of the movie, which comes in tiny spurts in between clips, can't last any longer than 5 minutes in entirety, effiectively making it simply another cartoon. This is not a movie to waste your money on. You can see almost the same thing by flipping to the Disney channel in late October, although the cable version may be slightly more interesting."
2,HUGE DISASPPOINTMENT,"As a fan of the great Disney villains, I eagerly looked toward this release, thinking I could see my favorites in one film. Well, WRONG! This is nothing but a series of Mickey/Donald/Goofy shorts strung together with a Halloween motif. You see the Disney villains on the front and back of the DVD cover, inside on the insert, but hardly in the movie! I don't know why the Disney folks allowed this sham to take place. If they wanted to release these Mickey, et al shorts, do it without the idea of the Disney villains. There is one scene where the villains sing a Broadway-like number, but it is too brief to be enjoyable. Maleficent, Cinderella's stepmother, etc are all relegated to just scenes where they sit in a cocktail-like sitting watching these mini-cartoons of Mickey and his friends. Knowing the likes of Maleficent, etc, they wouldn't stand for such goings-on! This is like watching Disney Animation 101 with the guise of Advanced Disney Masterpiece. AVOID!"
4,My kids are hooked on this dvd,My kids love this dvd. This was the 2nd I purchased this dvd. The first one got lost and it is one of those shows the kids had to have. It's especially fun around Halloween.
5,House of Mouse is a Rockin!!! Come on a knockin!!!,I had a Halloween Party in my classroom and this was perfect. It is for any Disney Lover and it combines old school cartoons with new school characters!!! Don't miss it!
5,Excellent Product,Excellent product for an excellent price. Wish this vendor also stocked and supplied the 11-inch vacuum sealer bags.
5,Useful and reusable,"We have really taken to the Seal-a-Meal system, which we use to package all our food purchases that are going into the freezer. My husband washes the used bags and uses them as the outer package on the next bag (simply seal the edge without using the vacuum), which reduces the cost...otherwise rather high, although you can argue it is cheap if if protects meat from freezer damage."
5,A great story!,"We've had to read this book many, many times to our little one. The adventures of Alexander and his new friend, Willie the windup mouse is just very sweet. It teaches children about friendship, being a true friend, and also, being there to help that friend even though you may be giving up something that you want in doing so. It's very sweet how the story ends with Willie becoming a real mouse because of Alexander's unselfishness (or was it really?). Alexander has a new playmate because he was willing to give up being a windup mouse so his friend wound not go into the trash. Just a very cute story and, to be honest, I couldn't resist saying, ""here Lizard Lizard"" when coming to the part of the lizard (remember the Taco Bell commercials with the dog saying that regarding Godzilla?). It made for a great laugh by all and now, my little one always asks me to say that when we come to that part of the story. Great imagination builder."
5,ALEXANDER AND THE WIND UP MOUSE ALWAYS A GREAT CHOICE,This book was always a favorite with my kids . Recently I was invited to a baby shower and the invitation asked that a book for the baby be included in the gift so we could start off the baby with a small library of reading material. Along with the request was a sticker to put in the book to tell who the book was from. This book was the first to come to mind-
1,Not for the PS2,I bought this game after looking at under the PS2 section and purchased it. After it arrived i found out that it's for the PC and it's a DVD. If you zoom in on the picture it even say's this. After this little dissapointment i went ahead and tried to install it on my computer. My DVD drive didn't even recognize the disk. This particaular version of the game as far as i can tell really sucks and if i were you i would avoid it with every part of your being. The other titles on the other hand are great. But please do not even attempt to click the purchase button on this titel. Especially if you don't have a computer.
3,Superman Flashlight,"My son likes this flashlight, but plays with it very little. The problem is that you must squeeze the trigger just right to make it the light work. It should be easier for a child to use. Other than that it is well built."
3,Beautiful Swing But Our Daughter Likes Portable Swing Better,This swing is beautiful but awkward to move from room to room. The toy bar does not come close enough for my daughter to ever get interested in it and when it's swinging the toy bar moves itself back behind the seat every time so she can't even see it. I guess the motion of the swing causes it to do this. We also have a small portable swing that my daughter likes much better. The portable swing was quite a bit cheaper too. The colors of the portable swing are brighter and the toy bar actually comes a lot closer to her. I do like the open top of this swing . . . we purchased a cradle swing in the beginning but bumped our daughter's head on the toy bar every time we used it so we got this one. This swing really hasn't been worth the money for us. It basically sits in the living room as a beautiful item to look at.
2,Mobile can be dangerous,"This swing is all right, my son loves to swing in it and it's useful when he's fighting sleep...it's what will finally get him to give in. But, my son is only 3 months old and the mobile has fallen off and hit him in the head twice now. The first time it fell off I thought I had attached it wrong, or too loosely. I left it off for a few days, and today I reattached it, assuring that it was SECURE...I was doing the dishes and my son had fallen asleep in the swing and all of a sudden I hear a bang and he just started SCREAMING. The mobile had once again fallen off and hit him square on the top of the head, leaving a red mark just to the left of his soft spot. I immediately came here to my computer to write this. BEWARE of the mobile! Also, my mobile, like the other reviews, also swings back out of baby's view. I have now taken the mobile off and will LEAVE it off. Too dangerous for baby.Good swing, terrible mobile attachment"
3,"Nice swing, but not for us unfortunately","I wanted it for the fact that it matched the rest of the set, however my lil guy wasn't a swing baby. He wanted nothing to do with it ""AT ALL""!!!!! I give it 3 stars because when we did have him in it, the mobile would constantly either move behind the seat or pop out all together."
1,Dead Motor!!!!!!,"I bought this swing for my daughter when she was a month old. I loved the look of the swing, plus it gave great head support, and it didn't hurt that my friend had the same one and loved it. Well about a month after I purchased it my friend's motor blew on her swing. Luckily babies r us gave her a new one. I figured she just got a bad swing until this morning the motor on my swing blew as well. Only after 3 months of using it... and it's not like my daughter over used it... I put her in it only every other day for no more than 20 mintutes so it's definately not from wearing it out!!!! For the money I paid for this swing I expected to use it for a second child!!!! So 2 of these swings motor blew that can't be a concidence!!!!!"
3,"She loves it, but it has problems","I just bought this swing last week. The lights don't work and neither does the music. We have to take the batteries out of it in order for it to stop swinging. Makes loud clicking noise. It still works though, surprisingly. My daught loves the swing, but the type and brand don't matter. We are going to get a new one."
2,There's better stuff out there!,"I hate this swing. It was a gift, and the box looked pretty. It was kinda difficult to assemble. The music is kinda whine-y, but my daughter seems to like it. What I hate most is the way the 6 speed feature works! There are two buttons, a green one for slow and a red one for fast. Then you push the green/red button once, twice, or three times to pick the speed. Really annoying!! The music button is even more annoying! When you just want to turn the stupid thing off, you have to push it three times! The quietest option is sooo faint, that sometimes you can tell if you're just going crazy or if it's still on!I was in Babies R Us the other day, and there are much nicer swings now! They have knobs that you can control speed/volume, instead of having to push stupid buttons a hundred times."
4,Almost perfect,"I LOVE this swing and so does my baby boy. He has been using it since the week he came home. He is 4 1/2 months old and still enjoys falling asleep in it. I agree with the other people who mentioned the mobile of bears fading into the background...but my baby isn't as interested in the bears now that he is getting older, so I just took that part off. I like that the music keeps playing and that I can turn the volume down. It seems to keep us both happy :-). I highly recommend this product and very happy we bought it. If you are looking for a portable swing this wouldn't be a good option for you; Although, my husband and I have carried it up and down the stairs several times (sans baby) and seem to do it with little difficulty---just have to be creative in the way you carry it. Still running on same batteries!!!!!!"
3,Not the best swing out there,"If I could go back, we'd get the Ocean Aquarium swing. We got the Windsor one since we had the carseat, stroller, pack and play and travel crib. The Ocean Aquarium looked like an eyesore. Our daughter was bored in the Windsor swing though she spent hours in her Ocean Aquarium bouncer watching the fish. We never had any mechanical issues with the swing. In hindsight we should have gotten the Ocean Aquarium swing."
3,"Okay, but became dangerous with age","My son is six months old today and this swing has now become a hazard. I used to put him in it when I had to run to the bathroom or to throw laundry in the dryer. I figured it was a safe place to leave him for a few minutes. My very curious son, however, has learned that he can reach out and grab the bars! I would have never seen this trick coming, and I wouldn't believe it had I not seen it myself. If I knew then what I know now, I would have gotten one like the Ocean Wonders which does not have bars in front of the child. When he was younger and a bit less grabby, it was a good swing."
4,A wonderful purchase.,"We received this swing as a gift from a friend. It is a beautiful swing, easy to assemble, reasonably priced and has a wonderful variety of music and swing speeds that all babies can enjoy. You won't be disappointed."
2,This swing is just okay,"I requested this swing for my babyshower. I have my 3rd daughter and needed a new swing since my last child was a baby 7 years ago. I do like the open top, and I like the colors I have ( a green plaid). But I do not care for the size. My daughter is 4 mo. now and she is a big girl. She does not really fit comfortably in the seat that seems not quite wide enough for her. I am not very impressed with the buttons you have to push a dozen times, and we have a decent sized house but the swing just seems to ""big"" at the base. Maybe this is normal for full sized swings but I don;t really like the amount of space the entire swing takes up. This is just my opinion. Hope this helps someone. :-)"
3,Good Product-Poor Packaging,"Item was shipped in it's ""display"" carton, not overboxed. As a result, the carton arrived dirty with corners crushed. Although this does not affect the swing's performance, as a baby shower gift, it looks pretty shabby in spite of its being new."
2,BAD motor,This swing never worked consistently. At first thought it was draining batteries but realized it's a motor issue. Now the motor is shot (of course it's past the warranty period). Seems a common theme based on other reviews. We didn't use it very often either.Bought the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Swing used for our second child (didn't want to spend another $100 on a swing) and have not had any problems. Have used it twice as much as we used the Graco.
3,Great as long as you don't want to use the mobile,"We bought the entire Windsor line because we love the pattern and are wildly impressed with how well the stroller handles. The problem is with the bears. Our baby would watch them (like she watches the ceiling fan) and when they would fall to the back, she would get mad. Once, the mobile fell off completely. I never put it back one because I am afraid it will hit her. She has used the swing daily since birth and now at 4 months, she still likes it. We also like the music and volume feature. I don't think the swing is loud at all. I am disappointed in the performance of the mobile, but otherwise I think the swing was worth what we paid."
3,This swing really strikes out ...,"My husband and I bought this swing in a sleep deprived state after coming home from the hospital with our little girl. Normally I would look at all the reviews first before buying. I also have the same complaints:1. I nearly broke the tab off the first time I closed the tray - it's very awkward and doesn't line up well.2. The mobile falls back behind the swing when it's rocking especially when you choose the high speed.3. The motor is loud.In addition, our baby didn't really like staying in the swing too much. The few times she fell asleep, she would either slump to the side or her head would slowly move forward until it was touching the tray.Also, I bought some suction cup toys to attach to the tray hoping that she might like being in the swing more but they wouldn't suction on to the tray. For our next baby I'll buy the Fisher Price cradle."
3,there is something else...,This purchase that i made was fine.. but you people have the nerve to send me an email asking me to rate this game.. after what you did to me with my very last purchase... i am shocked.... thanks for nothing i won't be shopping through you any more
3,"Fun game, but not a game you can replay","This is a great game with a great concept, but you cannot really replay the game. For the price that I see that people are selling it used (about $10), it is worth that. It is somewhat easy, but not too easy. The game was super fun, I just wish it had more depth. I give it five stars for being fun, but only 3 overall. If the game was more expensive, each of those would go down."
3,"Cute and fun, but juvenile and unrealistic.","I read a positive review in the Philadelphia Inquirer on this game and searched the mall high and low for it when it first arrived. While the game is fun for a little while, its cutesy cartoon graphic format is not the sort of (simulation) game I expected.And as for producing and mixing music, which I really looked forward to, don't get your hopes up. What you'll find are little knobs and levers, but not a re-creation of what its like to mix in a real life studio.The rest of the management game is very much a game, so... perhaps that really IS realistic.This is a very simplistic game with an average level of challenge to it. Truth be told, my interest didn't hold out long enough to make it past the fourth level. Worth the 20 bucks though, ...I guess."
4,"A Fun, yet Vulger, game","I have to say that I am getting such a kick out of this game. I have been waiting for a program like this to be relesed forever. Finally, it has been, but there is one problem. This game is incredibly vulgar! Almost anytime anyone in the entire game speaks you are greated at least one F word per sentence. Luckily this game is rated M, and rightfully so. If it wasn't for the uneeded language this game would have a five star rating. Deffinatly recommended from me, but not for younger players by any means."
4,IT IS THE BEST I 'VE HEARD YET FROM THIS CHOIR!,THE ALBUM IS AWESOME.AND THOSE MUSICIANS ARE DYNAMITE! IS THE CO-PRODUCER MARRIED? HE'S A HUNK!AND MR JAMES HALL DIRECTS THAT CHOIR WITH SUCH ENTHUSIAM AND ANNOITING!
3,Ok case,This case was very cheap. It fits the iphone 4s ok but is a little loose. Ok for the price but I would not buy again.
4,country aint cool?,"just like c.c turner I too first heard the man who loved beer on the radio bak in 95, i immediately had to go out and get it...since then I have bought all the albums...some dont fill their potential, some tracks are the same as others...this c.d however is lounge music at its most mellow as only lambchop know how. the first track of the bonus c.d ""corrosion"" is hauntingly on the verge of something darker than you want to think about. Beautiful."
3,Lambchop Mood Music Disappoints,"Lambchop's last album, ""Nixon,"" was wonderful and enchanting while this new effort is rather dull and monotonous because there are no real melodies here, just the lead singer languishing through melancholy lyrics in a sort of tongue-in-cheek cocktail hour meets country western. In ""Nixon"" the slow songs were beautiful melodies whereas in this current effort the songs sould like someone with a case of deep depression talking over half-baked instrumentals. At best, ""Is Woman"" makes decent background music. I love Lambchop and wish I could have written a more promising review."
3,Nixon without string machine,"Previous record by Lambchop "" Nixon"" was my favorite of Y2000, this is just a half of it. Songs are good, but strings are missing, that's the main minus."
2,A-Musing,"How Lambchop became pegged as an ""alt-country"" band is a grand indie joke, a collective brainwash by unenlightened critics. On their sixth release, Is a Woman, Kurt Wagner's unclassifiable crew of rotating musicians is an absurdist lounge act in Vegas. These 11 tracks rarely rise above a whisper. This quietude - initially compelling - defeats them. Each song begins with a calm authority drawing us in, yet without much in the way of modulation, nearly every one drags midway, until we lose what little narrative or thematic thread is there. The tunes evaporate before they're over. Through it all, Wagner muses: a backporch philosopher on a muggy, long afternoon. How very southern of him."
1,Dullest of the Dull,"...Words can't describe how unimpressive the songs are. If you dig really bad lounge music completely devoid of melody and emotion, this is the album for you! Awful!!!"
4,provocative and worthwhile,"Though it may seem a little dated, the issues and questions Martin raises are still relevant today. This thoughtful book speaks to the alienation and detachment many women feel at the hands of modern Western medicine and should be of interest to anyone studying medical anthropology, cultural andthropology, sociology, or women's studies. Some people may have problems with the methodology or feel that the book is pushing a feminist agenda (personally, I thought the chapter on PMS was a little muddy) but most people I know who've read it have found something in it that they can relate to even if they don't agree with Martin 100%."
4,ACROSS THE SEAS AND SIZES,I bought this ring as it looked ideal for an outfit I had and was going to wear to a wedding with a victorian theme. unfortunatly American ring sizes are numbers and UK sizes are letters and I was told by amazon that size 7 was an S and as that is what came up on amazon I trusted it. The ring would not even fit my little finger. fortunatly it fitted my daughter who is a size M or N so it fitted her perfectly and so she had it.otherwise I would have had to send it back. This is a pretty ring and she likes it a lot. The delivery was fast and customer service polite. if you like 'old fashioned' or 'victorian' style jewellery then you will like this.
5,Loved it!,"This is and will always be one of my favorite films! Gena Rowlands was absolutely unforgettable as Gloria. She deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar nomination for the role. The little boy John Phillips was adorable as Phil, ""I'm the man!"" Everything from the story and direction by John Cassevetes was terrific to the score by Bill Conti. I will always remember this film. It is in my Video collection! I will continue to enjoy it over and over. babymldaol.com Don't miss this one!! Forget the remake it has nothing to offer. is"
1,Am I the only one that noticed???,"WOW i cant believe im the only one that noticed that it's been recently remade with a sci-fi twist in ultra-vioelet, which I've heard also sucks."
3,"Would be 5-stars, but this video was cut/edited","Sudden Light: Donegal's NovelOne of my all-time favorite movies, easily worthy of 5 (or more stars), in the theatrical version. BUT, for reasons unknown, this one was cut in at least two key scenes, and probably many others. The scene in the apartment, when the shooters come in, we no longer see the mother and father with their guns and the shootings of the grandmother, mother, and father, and, off-camera, daughter. Instead, the camera is on Gloria and the kid in her apartment (something that wasn't in the original, as I recall). The scene where Gloria is on the curb with the kid and the mobsters roar up in their car. In the theatrical release, Gloria says, ""Suck on this!"" as she points and shoots them, point-blank. Major slice in the video, no ""Suck on this!"" You can see the jerkiness of the cut. I'm amazed that this was done. Interested in continuity errors? [...]"
5,Stage Lighting as Art,"Without a doubt, the best book on the market in its treatment of stage lighting as a vital dramatic art form. There isn't the usual multitude of chapters on the basics of wiring, bulbs, equipment which is obsolete before the book reaches the shelves, blue + green =?, etc., etc. Dr. Palmer simply explains how to create a beautiful picture on the stage. This is the step up for which the professional lighting artist has been waiting. Congratulations Richard."
1,This is a rip off,This was purchase as a paperback book where the purchasers thought it was in color. This is totally unusable since it is in B&W
3,I like Jai's music but was disappointed with Mondo Rama,"I have quite a collection of Indian classical and fusion music and have been a devotional singer for years. I also love Miles and SRV. I really love Jai's/Pagan Love Orchestra's muted trumpet/Miles Davis/devotional sound from parts of his first two realeases and think he is the best musician in the devotional genre. I understand what Jai is doing with Mondo Rama, but the result in my opinion doesn't work well. A perfect example is the Beatle's ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", one of my favorites. I was wondering when someone was going to cover this song, but was disappointed with Jai's attempt; it fell flat. Though I love both, I find the electric guitars and ""phychedelic"" sound very detracting from the devotional feel of his music. I think Jai needs a really good producer to show what he is capable of doing. He has all the components, but isn't really bringing them together as well as he could."
5,Mondo Heart,"We've been waiting 4 years for a new Pagan Love cd and it's been worth the wait ! Jai Uttal's musical vision has maturedimmensely since the great ""Shiva Station"". He brings a new conception to ancient prayers (we can pray and dance at the same time!), and dives deeper into an expanded pallette of sounds, musical themes, moods and colors . Listening to this collection of songs, I feel like I'm travelling across the globe.You have to listen to Jai's version of the Beatle's classic, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", and the Hebrew prayer for peace, ""Shalom"", to understand the vast scope of this CD."
3,So-so rama,"It's not Shiva Station, sadly. Although more complex on the surface, Mondo Rama is somehow less interesting and aurally appealing than its truly transcendental predecessor. The dubbed-in elements and techno trickery can't replicate the dense groove and instrumental interplay of, say, Station's amazing ""Night on the Ganges"" or even the plaintive ""Conductor"" from Beggars & Saints. If you're new to Jai Uttal, try one of those albums instead."
4,Wonderful tribute to Baltimore.,"While Baltimore Sun's columnist Michael Olesker (a native) is too liberal for my sensibilities, his ""Baltimore, ""If You Live Here, You're Home"" is a wonder read.A collection of his columns between 1979 and 1995; it's a respectful and loving paean to the city of Baltimore.The heroes, characters, politicos, sports figures, neighborhoods, crime and missing friends are featured subjects.It resonates for all who enjoy, love, live or work in Baltimore.Well done."
2,So bad it could be used for shark repellent,"I like monster movies, I like Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno and I love seeing things go ""BOOM"" but Godzilla was so dumb and derivative that all the fun was ....... out. It felt more like a really long preview than an actual movie. Some of the effects were very well executed but like ""Independence Day"" I just didn't get excited by the havoc. I guess my biggest complaint is the utterly shameless ripoff of the end of ""King Kong"" with poor Godzilla's final heartbeats pounding loudly for all to hear. Geez, couldn't they have ripped off stuff from a GOOD movie? ;) P.S. I know I shouldn't be looking for technical accuracy in a movie about a giant lizard rampaging through New York but... a Sidewinder missile blowing the top ten stories off of the Chrysler building?"
1,You people are reviewing for all the wrong reasons!,"There shall be no SEQUELS! The rights to godzilla have gone back to Japan and the TOHO company.This was not Godzilla!The two directors butchered him.There were a thosand things they could of done to raise Godzilla out of the pit that they put him in.Here are just a few:1.Keep the original sound track.The rap songs were out of place.2.Godzilla breathes fire!He didn't not in this movie.3.The name Godzilla is not the director's toy to play with,nor is he the director's pet iguna,which upon this was the image done with.4.Most important!Kept the original script!There was a much better one before and it had godzilla breath fire,defend the earth,go to Japan,and fought an another monster(a huge Gyphon).The script is on the web.One more thing:Was I expecting Shakphere? No.just Godzilla,like the name implied.He wasn't in this moive."
1,BEYOND CONTEMPT...this is NOT Godzilla! (ZERO stars),"For any young or ill-informed movie fan, let me say this: this movie has NOTHING to do with the traditional Godzilla. Do not waste even a moment of your time watching this movie. It is a colossal waste of time and money...the producers of this movie did not have even a remote clue about the magical world of kaiju eiga."
2,How could they do this to Godzilla?!,"This film is probably the best example of where movies are heading nowadays: big special effects, little or no plot. The acting was terrible, as was the script. It was meant to be funny and clever, I suppose, and it achieves the funny part, though it falls short of clever.As for the special effects, yeah, they were good, but they completely butchered Godzilla. So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit, but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI! In the new version, Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex. How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal, bird hipped dinosaur anyway, even through extreme mutation? It's just cheesy. Also, the baby zilla remind me WAY too much of velociraptors.Even if this film was meant to be a parody, as some have argued, it shouldn't have been. They should have let some TALENTED directors recreate this story for all it's glory."
1,Made by Japaneese NOT,"I was not very impressed. I would rather watch Raymond Burr in GODZILLA as this. Special effects was not impressive. For a good monster movie get The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms for a really good terror and special effects or War of the Worlds."
5,Godzilla,I bought this dvd for my son who loves Godzilla. Great movie at a great price! I highly recommend this movie.
2,bring back the old godzilla!!!,"If i was really really bored, i would recommend this movie. Although it IS watchable, the plot is too thin and the acting was horrible...The only thing that saved it from a one star rating was the special effects"
2,"Godzilla lays an egg, in more ways than one.","Godzilla is WHAT?!?! Godzilla is a giant fish-eating(?), egg-laying(!), tunneling(?), no-breath(!) creature, of varying intellect and size, that stomps around New York for two days, leaving the Keystone Kops, er, U.S. Army, to do most of the damage to the city, with minimal civilian casualties. How do we explain this? Simple.This was actually a different movie, with the soundtrack redubbed to replace 'Atomic Iguana' with 'Godzilla'. They should have kept the first name. I'm glad my folks bought the DVD instead of me, and I'm still trying to get a refund from the theater."
2,Not for those with intellectual tendencies.,"I rented this movie because, well, it was Saturday, the week-end, you know, and because I had always liked the Godzilla movies before this one. This was a real clunker. I wish Matthew Broderick would have quit acting after ""War Games"". What a dry, boring performance. And that girl. I can act better cutting my toenails than she did in this movie. I did like the new Godzilla better than the rubber suited lizards of the past, thought they too have their charm. Why did Godzilla have to die in the end? I would have liked for him to have stepped on Matthew Broderick and his ditzy girlfriend and finished the movie giving a huge roar of triumph as he destroyed NYC. No big loss in my opinion. And the story...STORY? What story. The best scenes were of Godzilla running around the city dodging the military's finest. All, in all, I would like to edit out all the humans and just have Godzilla destroying things for two hours. He was the best actor in the film!"
2,It's called a script...learn to write it,"Okay, the G-man is cool, the characters are colorful, and even though it is set in the disaster capital of the world (New York), the movie has too much freakin' rain in it!!! But that's not the biggest problem...Where the heck did these guys learn how to write?! Godzilla was a great idea with a bad script. Just rent the darn thing. If you watch it and then buy it, Godzilla should stomp on ya!"
5,GOTTA LOVE THIS ONE.,"THIS IS AN AWSOME GODZILLA FILM.OK GODZILLA IS IN NEW YORK INSTEAD OF JAPAN.THIS GODZILLA CLIMBS UP BUILDINGS AND GOES UNDER GROUND.HE IS AWSOME IN THIS FILM.HE IS FAST AND GOES THROUGH TUNNELS,AND THAT PART IS COOL.THE BABYZILLAS PART WAS COOL LIKE IN JURRASIC PARK THE PART WITH THE RAPTOR CHASE.I CANT TELL YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO DIDNT SEE IT HEHEHEHEHE."
3,I was not that far off my seat,"the movie didn't exactly move 4 me but it was OK. and all the people who though it was great, no offense but no ""awesome"" action in it."
1,This movie really sucked.,I'm sorry I bought this video. I don't know what I was thinking. This was a horrible production.
2,ONLY Jean Reno and the lizard made this film watchable.,"The special effects were in a word - cool. The movie was in a word - bad. Any movie that has characters who make me want to physically abuse my TV has a problem. At least Jean Reno was a highlight in an otherwise ""enh"" film."
1,Avoid at ALL COSTS!,"No stars for this piece of.... well, you know. In this version, Godzilla has no fire breath, runs AWAY from tanks, and is female. Despite what the director says, laying eggs = female (he claimed it didn't mean Godzilla had gotten a sex change; yeah, dude, next time you ovulate, let me know). Bad acting, bad dialogue, scenes directly ripped off from ""Jurassic Park"". An insult to Godzilla and his fans.Everyone who's seen a REAL Godzilla film is pretty much familiar with the genre. Why these clowns felt they needed to ""reinvent"" the character is beyond me. As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".Godzilla reduced to a big iguana. 'Nuff said."
3,"BAD STORY, GREAT DIGITAL SOUND !!!!","for the story , they mess with the Japanese legendary monster , different shape , at least they kept the same roar fx , as for the sound quality , this movie was made for the digital theater systems , now on blu ray yes the sound will be great , the dvd contains DTS system , now with true HD it may look better for a popcorn movie ."
1,Don't bother buying it without a torch in hand.,"They should've left the king of monsters to the Japanese. Atleast they could convince a guy to burn up in a hot suit while giving one [heck] of a show. The only times I liked the movie was when Broderick was nose to nose with Godzilla and when Godzilla jumped onto a building and did a classic roar to the skies.Bottom line, read the review title. And the only reason I posted 1 star is cuz I couldn't leave it blank."
1,&#65533;ú&#65533;{ Godzilla &#65533;&#65533;s much better...,"I don't know where to begin...Hollywood strikes again. The powers that be decided to ""improve"" the appearance of an already aesthetically pleasing icon. Then, for months and months, the media made us endure hours of ""this is not your daddy's Godzilla. This is new and improved.""I was disappointed to see the result...a giant iguana!The ""instant Godzilla"" comes across like, ""sugar, butter and artificial, instant junk food"" recipes. (Compared to products that have real ingredients and where the process is just as important as the results).What a waste of film. I saw the 2000 movie from Japan. Not the best but still a sigh of relief.I hope Hollywood did a better job when they remade ""The Ring."""
5,Gaint Monster Flick!!,"Great Gaint Monster Filmreminds me of the Gaint Monster films of the 50s(ie..the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms,the Gaint Behemoth,Godzilla)but with much better special effects!!"
2,Too much focus on special effects!,The old Godzilla movies had character. I grew up seeing them as a kid and thought Godzilla was great. This movie just focused on special effects and forgot about giving Godzilla some life. They should have put some humor and character into Godzilla in this movie.
3,Godzilla: Amazing and Awful,"It is what it is. The special effects, circa 1998, have held up well and deserve 5 stars. The story line, the acting and especially the dialogue, are uniformly awful and deserving of 1 star. Thus, I've split the difference. The only way to enjoy Godzilla, in my view, is on a large screen, with a really good surround sound system, and with low expectations."
1,Not The Same,"The movie wasn't bad. But, it really didn't have the Godzilla feel to it! It didn't have the Toho effects in it that we all have got to know! The Godzilla franchise should stay Japanese! And Mathew Brodericks acting in this is less convincing! Us Americans should keep hands off!!"
1,This is NOT Godzilla. Hollywood screws up again,"If I could give this less than a 1 star rating then I would. It get's half a star.Here's the short review. This movie is not a Godzilla film. It does not have the spirit nor the LOOK of the Toho original classic Japanese Godzilla.If a studio is going to make a film about a classic monster, due some research first and be respectful toward the character and his meaning and symbolism.Want to see a Real Godzilla movie, go watch original Godzilla (1954) and of course watch GODZILLA, MOTHRA, KING GHIDORAH: GIANT MONSTERS ALL OUT ATTACK."
1,"The worst ""G"" movie ever","This movie is a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the godzilla name. Matthew Broderick & the Iguana suck. You will be better off buying Godzilla 2000, which was the most amazing Godzilla movie ever."
5,My Favorite Popcorn Movie.,"OK OK, its not the greatest movi, but its fun. It's the perfect ""PUT YOUR BRAIN ON HOLD"" movie, for a Friday night. If you have a home theater system, crank it up, its even more fun."
2,"Not as bad as Independence Day and Stargate, but ...","one could think of a lot of better uses for the $100 million they dropped on this throway film. I give it a 2 only because Matthew Broderick is in it. I really should have given it a one.After seeing Stargate, I thought these shmucks would've have been run out of town. But no, give them even more money so they can make even more drech. Spare yourselves the disappointment. See something else. Anything else."
4,Why do people hate this so much,I am a huge godzilla fan and is kinda one of them This is a great movie there has alot of action in it sure he didnt look like godzilla but who cares get this movie.
4,Disaster,"I enjoy to classify movies to genres, this one, I suggest it to be a disaster movie. For a horror, usually the monster is only at the most the size of a dinosaur. This one, with the size of maybe the Statue of Liberty, is too large to be a monster, better say it's a disaster. You know Hollywood movies always raise new suspense again and again. So in this movie, it first make many baby godzillas, and for the baby godzillas, it's maybe only a horror singly, but there are so many, in total they are still a disaster. Finally they are destroyed by the air force. Then it makes the seemingly dead old godzilla alive again. Surely there is a continuous fight for this. It is said that the godzilla was mutated by radiation, so that's the point, people should always be careful that their new inventions can harm themselves."
1,They still could not..,"They made it with decent special effects, a nice jab\ode to Siskel and Ebert, the made godzilla look like an actual creature\animal that could exist....but it's still not a scary as a guy in a rubber suit kicking around model trains and balsa-wood models."
1,Buy Gojira Instead,"I have no problem with CGI instead of a guy in a rubber suit. That being said, this is NOT Godzilla. Godzilla looks like Godzilla. The filmakers could have made a CGI version that still looked the real thing. You can't just create a totally new monster and name it Godzilla and expect people to accept it. Well, on the other hand, I guess you can, but the real fans will not accept it. Also, Godzilla is a male. And he breathes atomic breath. And he attacks Tokyo, not NYC. This film is Godzilla in name only. What the filmakers did is the equivalent to making a James Bond film, casting Angelina Jolie in the title role (Jamie Bond), and changing her from British to an American.Oops. I've said to much. I hope I don't give a producer out there any stupid ideas. Hollywood is insane."
5,here the scoop,"first of all it has godzilla as the japanese wanted him.the plot is cut up into pieces: find godzilla, see if he is leathel, kill him, find baby godzillas, kill them, escape. it has great acting. for the people who say it has bad acting youve seen to many japanese godzilla movies they have bad acting. plus what did you want an american guy in a suit? heck no!!!! it would look fak and we have the technology to do better. if you dont like cgi, go see movie with clamation, minatures, and suits.ITS A GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,awful awful movie,"Words cannot describe this over-hyped, high budget disaster. Godzilla in New York sounds like a great idea, too bad 'great' never made it to any of the other levels. The whole thing is ridiculous, from Matthew Broderick collecting home pregnancy kits, to mini-Godzillas taking over Madison Square Garden. Brave French fighters join in on the act (ha ha ha!!!!!). They left a loophole at the end to make a sequel, just pray that it never happens. The Japanese should be scratching their heads wondering what the hell Hollywood was thinking with this disaster."
1,What were they thinking?,"After being a Godzilla fan since the age of four,I was really looking forward to seeing the American version back in the summer of 1998 and all I can say is ""What a big mistake this was?""That wasn't even the Godzilla we all know.Stick to the Godzilla movies of the past and of course Godzilla 2000,don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
3,"Overall good movie,stupid godzilla","This movie has an overgrown igauna rather than godzilla.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is bacause the action and stuff like that is good.But this Godzilla looks like drunk igauna than godzilla to me.The japinese godzilla is WAY better than this one.Also on the summary on the back of the movie says he bigger than ever.Yeah right!The original japenese version is 492 feet tall while this one 100 feet tall.Now lets get to the good side of this movie.The action is good and the movie thrilling.To make it simple what i think of this movie:Great movie,idioatic godzilla."
2,GET JURASSIC PARK INSTEAD,"I think most everyone saw this movie and most wish they hadn't. The movie is essentially a great exercise in special effects. I have to admit that I enjoy the characters of Matthew Broderick and especially Jean Reno, but the rest of them are just too cheesy. I don't know who let the lines in the script get through, but there should have been a much better plot for the film. I bought it to crank on my sound system, but now that Jurassic Park is out I can only see Jean Reno fans buying it."
1,Don't bother........,"OK, first, let me start of by saying this is NOT a godzilla movie. any true gojira( if you dont know who that is you have no reason to keep on reading. )fan should be ashamed if they actually liked this. If you want to see a true masterpiece, I would suggest the original 1954 movie, directed by Ishiro Honda."
2,not the best godzillla film......,"in this film godzilla does not look like...well godzilla, maybe because this godzilla is digital .the end part is the biggest let down godzilla is killed by missiles!!the old godzilla eats missiles like breadsticks! i gave it two stars becaues i liked the baby godzilla part."
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE'S I HAVE EVER SEEN,Godzilla is one of the worst movie's I have ever seen in my life. It's such a rip off of Jurassic Park and the graphics for the little dinosaurs are completly terrible. Plus very bad acting.
1,Another effects movie and nothing else.,"I grew up in a simplier time. This was the late 50's and early 60's. As a kid I'd spend my Saturdays at the neighborhood theatre enjoying grade B horror films from Roger Corman, Hammer and, of course, the latest Toho Godzilla movie. When I heard Godzilla was being remade into a multi million dollar film I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately I got my wish. After seeing this new version of Godzilla I had the same sinking feeling I had after seeing Godfather III. All the money the producers threw at this picture can't save it. A confusing script, an overdose of cheezy computer generated effects, sloppy editing, mis cast actors, weak music and alot of money waisted. What is sad is the fact that the money was there to make it right. It all starts with a decent script. Give me King Kong vs Godzilla any day over this mess. Hopefully, someday, Hollywood will remember how to make films, not video games. Jamey Moore"
1,"Big budget, Big Flop!!!","This is the poor movie I ever seen in my life, even if the specials effects are good, the money can't buy quality."
4,A good movie,"Godzilla is a great movie i have to say, but the old Godzilla movies were much better. Godzilla is definitely back!!!"
1,At least I saw it for free.,"Let's see, now. A giantic dinosaur travels from the Pacific to the Atlantic (via walking through Panama with no one noticing it) and goes to New York city for a secluded place to lay its eggs. It hides in Madison Square Garden and no one can find it. Yes, the movie makes that much sense throughout. I feel that I've been personally slapped in the face by the movie's makers. I hope Toho studios made a ton of money by selling the rights to Godzilla. Their creation has been shamed. Now send him back to Japan and Toho where he belongs! That's where we love him!"
3,Hmmmm. Let's look at what it had to offer.,"Godzilla was fun, but not intelligent. The cinematography was good, the only good acting was Hank Azaria as Animal. Everyone else had a stereotypical personality. Big G looked great. To be honest, I wished that the writers refrained from showing his full body until much later in the movie. I liked the bits and pieces of him that you saw at first. It kind left the rest to your imagination. I didn't like the crowd scenes though. Everybody was just running around like idiots, only doing it because the director told them to. None of their fear looked legit. It was campy, stupid, yet entertaining fun. It could have stocked up on brains before it went for the special effects."
3,Good entertainment but not more,"While I watched some of the Japanese Godzilla movies I was obviously also excited to see this big Budget production from Hollywood.+ Godzilla looks more realistic than in those Japanese budget productions+ Storyline...who cares. As long as there is lots of destruction ;-)- Fun: Less trashy movie. But to be honest. That's why I watch the Japanese versions.So, as a summary: Entertaining, but no positive surprises at all."
3,Decent film,"To me this film is a-ok. I like Godzilla's new appearance. Much better than his cornball, kiddy- appealing old one. Also, Godzilla in ths film exists independently of those in the old Japanese series. This is not a sequel to the Japanese Godzilla films, people. It is a self-contained movie. There's no inconsistency between this and previous Godzilla films. And this film has subplots (one poster said it didn't)."
3,Wrong Title,"Frankly, it's called Godzilla, but it's really a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms."
2,great looking DVD; lousy movie,"You've read the reviews, this movie stinks, but rent the DVD at your local video store. It's chock full of neat features: animated scene selections, a huge lizard foot that stomps down your screen every time you make a menu selection, trailers, documentary film, trailers for the original REAL Godzilla films.As for the movie itself, where the heck was Godzilla? Every time the going got good and Godzilla was getting it on with the New York skyline and swatting down pesky helicopters, boom, the story cuts back to the dull, dull humans and their dull, dull relationships. You watch a Godzilla movie, you want to see Big Green kick some Aishe, you don't want to see some dumb scientist pine over his dipsy-doodle girlfriend.And the end of the movie was a crime, utter and absolute. It didn't make me sad, it made me angry. A great classic movie monster like Godzilla humiliated by the U.S. Army, I mean, come on! It was a crime, an absolute crime. END"
4,"Not the best, but made my list","From the director of Independence day comes along probably the only movie since the 1970's that had a giant monster as the lead cast member. I liked this movie, and it holds up after repeated viewings."
1,They are ruining the legend.,Godzilla(1998) is the worst godzilla movie ever and is a disgrace to the real godzilla. One of the worst remakes of all time. Lacks the fun colorful campiness of some Godzilla flicks and the heart and true seriousness of others in the series. Also Godzilla doesn't look like godzilla he looks like regular Computer Geneated Crap! THE WORST REMAKE EVER MADE!!! Skip this and watch the rest.
1,I've Seen Thousands of Films and Walked Out of Only One. This One!,"I'm a huge movie buff. I've seen thousands of films--the good, the bad and the ugly. But I've walked out of only one. This one! The script is drivel and the acting is putrid. It neither believable, nor campy. Just a ridiculous mess. Avoid this like the plague. Just look at the number of one star reviews it's gotten here. And I gave it one because there was no lower rating allowed. It deserves a negative 5! Please don't patronize this crap!"
1,Godzilla's Supposed to Be Scary,"The problem with this remake of the horor classic is that its makers missed a few crucial points about the main character. The original came not long after atomic bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the stark black and white images of Tokyo's destruction play like a glimpse into the collective unconscious of Japan's traumatized people. The monster is nature [...] by man, the ruthless and inhuman will to destroy, the retribution of the gods upon man for the sin of the nuclear age; in a word, Godzilla is TERRIFYING!In the remake, we get instead an overgrown lizard who just wants to have her babies in peace. Which is fine, but shouldn't a remake of a classic convey more of the original than just its title?"
2,"Far from great, but not THAT bad","""Godzilla"" is one of those movies where you're better off just watching it for the special effects rather than for the script, story or plot. And the special effects ARE good although nothing groundbreaking. Matthew Broderick seems miscast for this role but he does a fairly credible job with the lousy script. After all, an actor can only carry a movie so far if the script and plot fall flat on their face.But I have to admit that I sort of liked this movie, SORT OF. No, I'm not claiming that it's great or a must-see. But for those of you who appreciate good special effects and cheap thrills it might be worth at least a rental. Just remember to put your brain on neutral and don't expect that much."
1,This is not Godzilla!!!!!,This movis is awful to put it mildly!!It should not even be called godzilla. Let's take a look at him. He's an overgrown iguana made by a french h-bomb. I mean he was running wildly away from some little helicopters shooting bullets!This movie is a dissapointment to us G Fans!!
3,Know this...,"This creature's name is Zilla, and was featured in Godzilla the Final Wars. The real Godzilla beat the mississippi out of Zilla and fried him like a turkey with his hot breath. Just so you know... he was beat up by the Original. Beats me why producers decided to go with this version of computer generated monster- but the story was okay so I gave it 3stars. I own it, it completes my collection."
2,BLAH,My rating refers to its connection to Godzilla. It was a great monster movie but Iguanosaurus is NO Godzilla! My family liked it so much 'coz of the special effects. they even think the new Hesei film G looks cheezy. This a Godzilla abomination.
1,"Compared to the other 22 movies, this one's awful!","I get more of a smile when I watch the Big G's death scene in Godzilla Vs. Destroyah then when I watch this entire movie! (and trust me, if you've seen Godzilla Vs. Destroyah, you KNOW that's bad!)"
4,Not as bad as alot of people say.,"I am a HUGE Godzilla fan.This movie is not all that bad.It does not have the charm of the early G-films but it is alot better that than Everything in between ""Destroy all Monsters""-1967 and ""Godzilla vs. Biolante""1989.Have some fun and don't be overly critical- thats what Godzilla movies are all about.If this film were to be titled something other than Godzilla, I guarantee that all the Godzilla fans would have loved this."
4,"What if it wasn't called ""Godzilla?""","I really liked this movie, but probably because I've never been a Japanese-Godzilla fan. It was a decent moster-movie with some fun effects and a (psuedo)-scientific storyline.I think this movie may have been better reviewed if it weren't called ""Godzilla,"" but maybe that's just me."
2,Not that good--but if you've got nothing better to do...,"This movie is certainly not what one would call good, but it certainly is entertaining.Finding the urban jungle of Manhattan a suitable environment, a creature deemed ""Godzilla"" after the popular character of B-movie fame, rampages through the island in search of food and sanctuary. Naturally the army is called in, but despite their advanced weaponry, ""Godzilla"" manages to make a mockery of their attempts to bring him down.But where the army fails, a motley assortment characters, a scientist, a French secret agent, and a couple of journalists succeed.Added to this is a lame love interest element and the occasional bit of slap-stick humour, and you have a suitable film for killing a couple hours on a cold winter's night."
2,What a Disappointment!!!,"Well, I admit I was interested in this movie when it came out. I actually saw it in the IMAX--what a waste of money! First, the two main characters seem like mindless airheads. I expected more from Matthew Broderick. Still, it is GODZILLA after all and part of the old school Godzilla was the whole campiness of it all. I was disappointed more than anything else..."
3,I returned this,"I had to return this because of the region code, but if it had not been for that I think it would have been a real treat to see the original Japanese edition of this film that some of us remember seeing on TV when we were little. If you get the right region code, this should be a treat."
4,"Whats in a Name? ""The Rhedosaurus returns!""","For the life of me I can't figure out why this is titled Godzilla.Anyone who has loved the TOHO classics will be disapointed. It lacks TOHO's ""Godzilla"" child like personality to say nothing about Godzilla's Biped(Man in a monster suit)swagger.The reason is simple it's been missed ""labeled"". In fact it is a good updating of ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"". In this movie the beast is a (CGI) quadra-ped once again terrorizing New York (Not Tokyo). Eating policemen and finally meeting his /her end in/on a New York Landmark.The movie is not all that ""bad"" although it is played a little ""too cute and tongue and cheek"" for the Scifi genre. The movie also suffers from over the top special effects.Enjoy the Ride!"
3,Would'nt be bad if it wasn't named 'GODZILLA',"I went into this movie with an open mind- you have to. It's not the same old TOHO man-in-rubber that all true G-fans love. The special effects were extremely well done, but the plot left something to be desired. I think I would have preferred if the movie company would have named this ""Beast from 20,000 fathoms II"""
2,Good SFX bad most other things .,"Once again as summer hit , the multiplexes were filled with all nonsense SFX driven movies . This the most hyped film of last year turned out to be one of the worst . Like most blockbusters this relys on stunning SFX which it certainly has however the plot is extremely shallow and the script is full of cheesey dialogue . If you manage to look past the poor script at the wonderful actors they try to hoist this out of its rubbish status but not even they can salvage it . However many SFX they put in Godzilla will always be a man in a rubber suit ."
1,"I wish I could give it ""0""","Change the title and I'll give it three stars. This is NOT Godzilla. This is a movie about a giant iguana that is about half the size of the King of Monsters, and has none of his strengths or powers. I saw this in the theater...only the money I spent kept me from walking out. Search for Godzilla again and purchase the new Gojira/Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition DVD. Use this DVD for skeet practice only."
3,COOL FLICK (3 1/2 STARS),"This was a pretty good movie. I like when the old man is fishingin the Hudson river, and Godzilla comes out, it's cool! I boughtthe dvd about 5 years ago, and I'm happy I did. The special FXare very good, and so is the sound quality. If you like the oldGodzilla movies, you'll love this updated version! Enjoy!"
1,"A terrible, terrible, debacle of giant lizard-ness.","I really don't know what these guys were thinking. Maybe their thought process went a little like this:Exec #1: I have a great (read:stupid)idea!Exec #2: What is it?Exec #1: Remember those old Godzillla movies?Exec #2: The ones that were really cool and didn't feature Matthew Broderick?Exec #1: Yeah! Let's make a movie that's the complete opposite of that!So that's how we got H-bomb-proof lizards turning into asexual she-beasts rampaging about in Manhattan. There are documentaries about cardboard factories more interesting than this. And if that doesn't put the terror of this movie's idiocy in perspective, think about this: I've seen Ernest Goes To Camp SIX TIMES, and I still refuse to watch this trash again."
2,The Japanese Do a MUCH Better Job,The look and flow of this American film is very disappointing. Don't bother. Try some of the 1990's-2000's Japanese versions.
4,Loved IT!,"Ok Ok Most people who saw this Gozilla thought it sucked. I think it didn't though. The reason most people don't like this Godzilla is because Godzilla doesn't have an enemy to face plus the raptors and there being 2 Godzilla's (or at least that's what I think). But I loved it because it took place in New York instead of always being in Japan, Godzilla just being himself, the mouths of the people actually going with the words, and a good cast."
1,T' was commercialism that killed the beast !,"This is not Godziila, perhaps a giant lizard attacking NYC, but those are two different things.I love the campiness, bad dubbing, and low tech effects of the early (real) Godzilla flicks but most of all I love the SPIRIT that those films were made with.This high-tech 1998 mis-named Godzilla movie is just a long string of computer effects, corporate sponsors and overall emptiness. No spirit or purpose (other than $$$) whatsoever.A product for the indiscriminate masses."
1,Adding insult to injury,"What were these morons thinking when they made this film? Not only is this brain dead, it's an incoherent, Jurassic Park rip-off, and it utterly destroys the original Godzilla legend/theme. The original ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" is about more than a giant lizard stepping on people and buildings, it's a metaphor for the horrors of war, anti-nukes, pro environment, man and his machines are destorying life, etc, etc. What is this movie about? A retarded mutant reptile that doesn't even do that much damage (it eats fish and the army is responsible for destroying half the city). Come on, Hollywood, do something crazy: make a new, fresh, original film!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It's GREAT for What It Is...,"This movie is based on 20-odd, cheesy, Japanese monster movies featuring an actor walking around in a giant rubber suit, smashing cheesy models of Tokyo and military hardware. So, for what it is--an updated version with an INCREDIBLY-ARTICULATED, computer-generated creature, but a cheesy storyline and plastic human characters--it's a GREAT step forward on a stale movie series! Sure, there are a bunch of disappointing moments (he only breathes fire twice, go figure!), but overall it's a fun flick. I got a good chuckle out of the obnoxious French agents, led by Jean Reno; I even cheered when the baby Godzillas got a taste of their first French food in Madison Square Garden! Buy it, enjoy it, watch it, and goof on it with a bunch of friends; it's destined to be a good party movie!"
1,"Please, watch paint dry- this is a wretched film.","Wow, all that money and they forgot...a plot! Poor actors! poor audience! The 'monster' was cribbed from Lost World... You can, to stave off boredom, count the numerous cliques, or plot holes...or better yet- take a nap- a more effective and enjoyable use of time."
2,Yawn!,"Boring! People can't kill Godzilla one way, they do it again, and kill him! Bad jokes! However, the graphics were good, but I still hate the new Godzilla from the old one."
4,For Academy Award winning performances - buy GWTW,"Yea, yea, critics panned it. So it wasn't original and character development didn't. If you watch a movie called ""Godzilla"" expect it to be cheesey, FUN and cheesey, with FUN in all caps."
2,"Great atmosphere, good effects, but acting? Story?","The summary kind of says it all. Nice try, but the producers would've been better off spending a little more on the writing and the director should've shown up for work."
1,What did they do to Godzilla?,This movie is horrible. They changed Godzilla all around. When Godzilla blows its fire it isint even the correct color. Godzilla looks more like a Lizard than a Dinosaur creature. The acting was horrible.
5,BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!,"Bottom line Great Creature, Great Effects, Great Story, Great Acting, Great Action. Overall THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!"
2,"Almost, but no cigar.","They had it, had the idea, had the willingness of the audience, and then just threw it out the window. The had nothing holding it together. One or two scattered good parts, but then nothing in the middle to fill the holes. Almost had it, then just couldnt hold on."
3,"ACTION WAS GOOD, REALISM BAD","Great action but the main characters wouldn't die! first they get stuck in the car in Godzilla's mouth, then they have to fight off a herd of baby godzillas in Madison Square Garden??? If you like action though , its smashing baby!"
1,An awful terrible movie,"Do what you an to avoid wasting your money, time, and soul on this classis piece of Hollywood trash. Boring, boring, predictable, predictable, flat, lackluster, and yes, even the monsters aren't that cool. SNORE zzzz zzzzz zzzzz zzzzzz"
2,"Great giant monster movie, but not Godzilla","I wish I could give this two ratings, so here it is:How do you rate this item (As a Godzilla movie)? *How do you rate this item (As a giant monster movie)? ****This flick is entertaining, has great SPFX, and acceptable acting. The problem? The title of this movie is GODZILLA. We all know this was Emmerich and Devlin's attempt to give us an American Godzilla movie, but they fell way short of that goal. If you want to see our big Ape-Whale in true form, go get Gojira, Godzilla 1985, vs. Biollante, or any of the 90's Godzilla movies. Even Godzilla Final Wars is top-notch Kaiju fare. If you're expecting a Godzilla movie, avoid this like the plague..."
1,America Harleys Chevrolet NOT GODZILLA,Hey I love my country but the Japanese had something. And the producers and the director of this film should not have Americanized it! Rubber suit and cheesy back drops made the Kaiju the best. The problems begin with a horrible plot not very original. Pathetic acting from some decent actors.Chalk this one up with the remake of Lost in space as bargain bin fodder!This phony Lizard gets DEALT with in Godzilla final wars youll be happy to know.What killed this is...GODZILLA is NOT a female! Everyone knows Godzilla is a dude!Him and Anguirus use to pound beers then beat up on monster zero and his gang while they were stationed on monster island.
1,We hated it!,"Me and my kids love Godzilla flixs; the monsters, the fighting, the special effects, the jets, bombs, lazers, and the .... sunshine! This movie is terrible because nearly all the Godzilla shots are at night or are underground; there are almost no complete body shots of the G-myster. Plus there are no other monsters; it's just Godzy against helicopters and jets. We loved GZ VS Megurious, and GMK."
1,Round-eye Godzilla BAD!,"This is not Godzilla. This is a Jurassic Park T-Rex on steroids. If you want to see Godzilla, see the Japanese films. This film is basically a remake of the 1956 movie Godzilla, King of the Monsters and although the original is in black & white, it is far superior to this movie. If you like special effects, this may be the movie for you as ""Godzilla"" does look impressive, but unlike the real Godzilla, the CGI monster lacks character and soul. Sorry folks, but the Japanese have got us beat as far as making Godzilla movies and well they should since Godzilla is a Japanese original and 99% of the time the original is the best."
1,POS,"POS got to me so fast, and i couldn't wait to pop it in and watch it! To bad that all I was able to see was the fbi warning for copy right infringment. That was followed by a midnight blue screen, like the disc was blank. Great, POS."
3,finally a godzilla for the whole family,"Finally! A godzilla movie with a realistic monster. A movie that the whole family can enjoy, not just small children. The man in the rubber suit in all the other godzilla movies was even more ridiculous than Barney. Rubber suit godzilla could barely move. .The only problem with this movie is the acting. it is very very bad."
5,An excellent remake of the original(s)!,This movie is better than the original(s)!Godzilla is much more realistic than in the original(s).The special effects in that movie are the best you'll ever see!
3,Worth The Price,"I can not believe how negative the reviews are for this movie. It's not perfect, but it is entertaining. The acting is sufficient for a monster movie, and the cast do a good job considering IT IS A MONSTER MOVIE FOLKS. The special effects are of the ""Jurassic Park"" caliber. I don't get the hostility towards this movie. Oh I get it, if you like a movie with a man in a rubber monster suit, cheesy special effects, toy tanks, plastic Lego cities, silly plot lines and terrible overdubbing then don't bother with this Godzilla. Rent the old Japanese movies. I always thought they were bad with the exception of the original with Raymond Burr. The story line of this Godzilla is fast paced. Just when you think the movie is over, you get to see just how much punishment a New York City taxi can take. If this was made by our friends in Japan it would have been called ""Godzilla Attacks New York"" The price is a couple dollars more than renting it, I feel it is worth the price."
1,NOT A REAL GODZILLA MOVIE,"This is NOT the Godzilla we know and love, this is a feeble Hollywood fabrication. Godzilla is invincible and canot be killed by wimpy human armaments of any kind & has laser vision eyes. Hollywood mooks think he's a fish eating, fire breathing lizard that can be killed with torpedoes & heat-seaking missiles. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. I'M PISSED!Cool CG graphics, reminiscent of Jurassic Park... Watch the old Godzilla, or give him his real powers back!"
4,GINO,"First things first, if you are a massive fan of the Japanese Godzilla and are expecting to see a kickass CGI version of the classic tale, then this movie is not for you. This movie has basically nothing to do with the original except for the idea of a giant lizard tearing cities apart.But this is not a bad thing. This movie is an enjoyable monster-flick with good CGI and half-decent story (nothing amazing, but really not that bad), and you will enjoy it if you like monster movies and do not compare it to the Japanese original."
3,good movie but like everyone else has said...,"it is NOT Godzilla. The old Godzilla relied on strength and its atomic breath to win in battles and/or destroy the city it wanted. This Godzilla has to rely on wits and speed to do...watever its doing. GINO(Godzilla in Name Only) is not very strong. its big and fast, but it cant take a hit to well. (3 missles and it died). but at the end we see one of its eggs has survived..... Does this mean a sequel? If they do make a sequel(and i dont mean that cartoon GINO thing), it had better be better than this movie. Peace"
1,Ugh! Simply horrible!,"This was one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to walk out of and/or demand my money back. Toho had finally killed off their monster, however, this stinkeroo offended them so bad that they had to bring the real 'G' back to get the offensive taste out of their collective mouths.It would not have been so bad had it not been for the whole ""baby godzillas"" sequence. I can think of a dozen other things these talentless hacks could have shown us to fill in the time.Let's hope that Toho doesn't ever forget about this."
1,"Bizarre, and not in a good way","I should have read some reviews before I watched this, but I was thinking, what could go wrong? Little did I know....Well, the big thing that goes wrong is that the big monster is not Godzilla. I don't know who or what he is, but he's not Godzilla. I have to guess that the people who made this movie had never seen a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, this rates -10, because Godzilla is simply not in it.As a generic monster movie, it's really not very interesting, and not particularly well done, aside from the special effects. The ending would be lame if it weren't so bad. I am guessing that the people who made this were probably not monster movie fans either."
1,Point missed,"The magic behind the original Japanese Gojira series of movies is the corniness of the plot as well as the cheekiness of the special effects. Just as the ""Batman"" movie completely lost the ""comic book"" feel of the original series, this movie loses the entire sense of the character and allows the ""plot"" to deteriorate into nothing more than a ""shoot 'em up- blow 'em up"" movie with a lot of gratuitous violence toward an animal whose only crime is the fact that it is behaving like an animal. I literally threw this in the trash 3/4 of the way through the movie."
5,deeply powerful,brilliant and funny: cast of charactersinnovative scenes and situationsgreat cinematicsgreat plotscary as heck creature put to life on screendeep storyamazing endinghave this on dvd and love it every time I watch it
1,LISTEN TO ME BEFORE YOU REVIEW THIS TIME!,"THERE WILL BE NO SEQUELS! The rights to Godzilla have gone back to Toho! And THEY(Toho) ARE MAKING ANOTHER JAPANESSE GODZILLA MOVIE!(called Godzilla 2000,going to be great) This movie is flith and not worthy of the name."
1,Godzilla Dies?,"The first live action (American made w/German director) attempt at Godzilla, and zilla gets blasted at the end of the movie but a couple of rockets and dies. WTF was Roland Emmerich thinking???? The Japanese have been doing Godzilla for over 50 years and he's still alive! One of those movies were sequels were planned but the studio had other ideas."
3,Brain Stew,This Movie Was a major Let Down To Us Godzilla Fans.It Gets 3 stars just because it has a remix of the amazing song brain stew by green day.
1,This is NOT Godzilla,"Here it is, what every Godzilla fan wanted. Hollywood and a big budget, and this is all we got? First off, the French? The French saves the day? Please, my mother can beat the French. Second, a lame storyline, it is like Jurassic Park in NYC. Babyzilla's that look like raptors. The king of all movie mistakes, you have a product that fans all around the world know, and YOU CHANGE IT? Give me a man in a rubber suit that looks like a T-Rex than a CGI iguana on steroids? No radioactive fire-breath, no one running thru the streets of NYC screaming Godzilla! Thank God, Toho came out with Godzilla 2000 and basically said ""Forgive us for letting Hollywood make that horrible movie! Here is what you wanted!"""
3,Forget the title- watch the movie,"I'm sorry that all the people who love the Japanese Godzilla should dislike this movie so much. It's a good, fast-paced monster flick; nothing particularly original, but it moves right along and has great special effects. It's nothing like the Japanese Godzilla and I have a suspicion that if the producers had called it something else the reviews would have been a lot more positive. Once you treat it as just a sci fi action pic, it works quite well."
1,This DVD is a ripoff.,"Even if you like this the Tri-Star Godzilla this disc is a rip-off. Its exactly the same as the previous release. They just left off the trailers, which were good. Added a long trailer for Sony's other Godzilla releases which is awful and in some places deceptively shows scenes from the wrong movies (EX. The teaser for GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH shows the Godzilla Ghodorah battle from GMK: Giant Monsters All Out Attack and the one for GODZILLA FINAL WARS suspiciously shows a lot clips of there own American version of Godzilla while omitting clips of the real one.) andalso added three episodes of the animated series. bUt they are three of the same episodes available on the Animated series discs. Youd be better off buing one of the previous releases from the used discs. They go for about $1. (and no one is taking)"
1,GOD-AWFUL.,"I heard this movie was really bad before I rented it, and so I said to myself, I said self...how bad could it actually be? All those millions of people who warned me can't all be right. This is what I get for being hardheaded! I actually found myself rooting for poor Godzilla. Think about it, all she wanted to do was find a place to lay an egg and raise and nuture her child. Is this any reason to persucute this creature? With all the so called geniuses in the science lab, could they not have found a way to tame Godzilla, rather than attack her and annilate this presumably docile giant lizard? This movie is a sad commentary on humanity. It portrays us as over-zealous human beings reacting to a situation with extreme violence rather than thinking it out and dealing with this encounter in an intelligent way. This was a very cruel movie."
2,So bad it could be used for shark repellent,"I like monster movies, I like Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno and I love seeing things go ""BOOM"" but Godzilla was so dumb and derivative that all the fun was sucked out. It felt more like a really long preview than an actual movie. Some of the effects were very well executed but like ""Independence Day"" I just didn't get excited by the havoc. I guess my biggest complaint is the utterly shameless ripoff of the end of ""King Kong"" with poor Godzilla's final heartbeats pounding loudly for all to hear. Geez, couldn't they have ripped off stuff from a GOOD movie? ;) P.S. I know I shouldn't be looking for technical accuracy in a movie about a giant lizard rampaging through New York but... a Sidewinder missile blowing the top ten stories off of the Chrysler building?"
2,I Was Rooting for the Monster!,"The Godzilla effect is eons better than the one of the cheesy Japanese films but that is about all that this entire flick has going for it! The characters portrayed by Broderick and others are so uninteresting that I was hoping that they would meet an early demise. Which is to say, the unbearably bad movie would have been over much sooner than it was.Like another reviewer, I DID like the Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page tune heard over the end credits."
2,Ehh....,"While this is a moderately good monster movie, this is a horrible Godzilla movie. It's virtually identical to ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". And another thing that bugs me about this movie is the total lack of research. In the film, the AH-64 Apache helicopter is shown as a one-man chopper with guns on either side of the cockpit. The real AH-64 is a two-man chopper with one machine gun mounted UNDER the cockpit. Also, the creature's claws are all wrong. Lizard claws are flat on the bottom, whereas the creature's are rounded, like birds. And whoever came up with that ""within a year, these 200 babies could become 40,000"" line should watch the movie again. The first one wasn't able to lay eggs until it was at least thiry years old. Thirty years seems like planty of time to hunt down and destroy those hatchlings."
2,A Total Shame......,"Godzilla could of been a really good movie. That is, if it didn't have such a stupid and pointless plot, bad acting, awful direction, was more scary and actually had a purpose. It was a poorly-done, deeply flawed, pointless disappointment that I don't recommend.I rate Godzilla 5 out of 10. The special effects were sort of effective, and it is a total shame the whole movie wasn't as good."
2,A flop,"Sad to say, ""Godzilla"" pretty much falls flat on its face. The characters are mostly stupid and many of the lines in the movie are chessy. Some of the special effects doesn't quit make up for that and I really expected this to be a great sci-fi movie of '98. I can't believe the guys that made that awesome ""Independence Day"" made this. Oh well, maybe ""Godzilla 2000"" will be much better."
3,overblown,"Godzilla is no more than an overblown no-brainer. It does have impressive special effects,but nothing else. The acting isn't among the greatest and it gets more predictable as it goes along. Almost to the point of being unintentionally hilarious."
2,Size does matter... but the argument doesn't,"This film doesn't even reach the cheesy entertainment retro B popcorn genre, you'll enjoy this one only if you are mind-retarded, ID4 was a hit one is a punch out. And probably a sequel which promise to be worse than this one will be released."
3,Operative word here....fun...,"Godzilla, though not as thought provoking as the Japanese original (sans Raymond Burr), it does deliver on basic entertainment.Decent special effects, some good scenes. Lots of the acting was pitiful, yeah they tried coasting this in on the coattails of ID4. Yeah, seen the plot before. Glad I got a dollar off on the rental.Not as bad as some people make it out to be. The DVD was a good example of the tech. Though not a keeper.A decent beer-with-buddies-armed-with-rubber-tipped-dart-guns to shoot Matt play girlfriend flick, when nothing really matters what is going on the screen.Fun.And make sure you get it as a discount rental."
1,yuk!,"worst monster movie ever made, the japanesse films were bad, but good. this just completly sucks. this monster is nothing at all like the REAL godzilla. i'd say the special effects were good, but that's not enough to save this waste of time. i own every godzilla flick but will not include this in my collection. can't wait to see how godzilla 2000 turns out."
1,Godzilla Goes High Tech; Viewers Stifle Yawns,"Frankly, we were all better off when Godzilla was clearly some guy in a rubber suit stomping miniture sets. While the original and its sequals may have been decidedly low-tech, they possessed a certain fun-ness which made them entertaining at worst-- something which all the millions poured into this film's special effects couldn't buy."
3,I promise you all...,"that if I ever get to Hollywood, I'm gonna redo ""GODZILLA"" and give the loyal fans what they want---the fire, threats, big feet, everything."
1,Why I rated this one (1) star...,...is because that's the lowest the web-site would otherwise allow ! ( And I've already spent far too much time bothering to say so !!! )
2,Hank Azaria was the best part of this piece of [junk]!!!!,"I sat through this movie, watching a giant monster stomp through New York, yet Godzilla never appeared.To me, Godzilla will always be a guy in a rubber suit stomping a styrofoam copy (a poorly constructed one) of Tokyo. That's the ONLY way to enjoy Godzilla."
1,YAWN!,"This is one of the worst movies i have seen.Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have made good movies like ""Stargate"" and ""Independence day"" but this almost made me sleep.It has the worst acting iv'e ever seen and the humor doesn't make you laugh.Godzilla itself looks like the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and when they find Godzillas nest it's directly ripped from aliens(Except the eggs are bigger).The little godzillas are also from Jurassic Park and so is the car chase.But the biggest mistake is to make Godzilla so damn weak:The original Godzilla zould be shot at half of the movie by a whole army and still it could destroy the whole Tokyo,but for this new Godzilla you just need a few missiles to kill it.What was the point in making this movie."
1,grrrrrr.,"Alright, this film sucks. No other way to say it. No plot, no good acting, and it as the worst 2D special effects. Time to bring back the guys in the lizard suits. AND THE MOVIE IS TOO DAMN DARK! You can't see a fricking thing! GRRRR!"
1,Very Little of Interest for Godzilla or Movie Fans,"Just plain bad idea. The film makers obviously thought they were updating a classic but unfortunately captured none of the original spirit. That would have been OK if the movie had turned out to be good at what it was but, alas, it was not even a good special effects monster action movie."
3,Why call it Godzilla???????,"The movie could of been name the ""Killer Muntant Raptor"" or something...enjoyable...In a FX SciFi Monster movie kind of way...but it was ""NO GODZILLA""!!!... sorta of like calling Arnold's ""Conan the Barbarian""..Conan...Conan Where???....Godzilla Where???....Why call it Godzilla???"
5,"A thrilling, spine tingling, motion picture. Or just great!","The movie was very good. I liked most of it but I would have liked to have seen Godzilla incinerate something because it is vitious, not becaus it's tring to defend itself. Overall it was an excellent movie!*****"
4,Fun to watch and entertaining!,"People who watch ""Godzilla"" shouldn't take this movie so seriously! Its purpose is clearly to be enjoyed. This movie is meant to be fun to watch and entertaining, and that's exactly what ""Godzilla"" did to millions of people around the world. Grrr!!"
4,A classic monster movie,"How any true Godzilla fan could hate this movie is beyond me. It delivers in many important ways, most notably the monster. Godzilla, as he is here, is perhapse the most impresive screen monster yet. Yes the movie has its problems. The acting is stale at times, the destruction could have been a bit more wholesale, and I would be the last person on earth to complain if Godzilla had had atomic breath. But at the same time the chase scenes are intense, Godzilla's new look is great, Godzilla is also remarkably intellegent, and the Babyzilla's provide a rational for Godzilla coming to New York. All in all a darn good movie. And a damn fine Godzilla movie! The best this genre has produced in over 50 years. Go, go Godzilla"
2,"a heartless, brainless and souless film","other than some fine effects work, this is the definition of bad filmaking. Bad script, bad acting, bad directing. (get the idea that this film is bad!)an empty souless film that wastes the talents of its FX crew. With none of the charm or style of the best of the original films,and only a big frightened iguana as the monster. one huge missed opportunity. by the way... have i told you that its also BAD!!!!!!"
3,This movie was OK.,"If you haven't seen this movie, let me tell you that the star Matthew Broderick doesn't do a good job. Being an intelligent biologist is not his thing, it's the same story with Maria Pitillo (Audrey). The 200 foot lizard, Hank Azaria (the camera man that nearly gets stepped on in the commercials), and Jean Reno (the french secret agent) make the movie worth watching. Thoes three keep me watching it."
3,"Great Special Effects, but bad acting.","Godzilla was just another Sci-Fi thriller that gives you a rush, but had mediocre acting. It had an O.K. plot. The Soundtrack was better than the movie."
3,"Uh, well...","I'm a big fan of Roland Emmerich. I think he's one of the greatest finds of the 90's as far as film directors go. ""Stargate"" and ""ID4"" were fantastic. Godzilla is flawed. Matthew Broderick's acting in this film was oddly insufficient. (Did he REALLY want to do this movie?). Jean Reno was by far the most interesting as a French military man. Not the awful piece of puke that most people saw it as.(Hey folks, the new Godzilla is cool-looking if not the movie itself). But definitely not the strongest of Emmerich's films. Better luck next time."
3,"It was okay, but boring.","It was diferent. Pretty good, but I don't know. It wasn't that good at all."
2,Worst Movie I ever Loved,"No plot, poor to mediocre acting, BAD editing, (Godzilla was anywhere from 50 to 500 ft tall). But that said, It was an action packed joy ride from begining to end. I'm embarassed to say I loved it."
1,God forbid!,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Unless you are really bored, and all the other rentals are out, do not rent this. DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE (unless you like to torture yourself).Bad plot, horrible acting, and you have to suspend more than just your disbelief."
2,Well........,"I think that this movie could have been OK if it had not been called ""Godzilla""! It should have been called Jurrasic Park IIIor whatever it would have been at the time. I have always loved Godzilla, and I mean the real Godzilla. The sad part is, I can see that this movie was trying to give a modern view of the old Godzilla films, but to no effect. A budget does not make a movie. It was not the actors, it was the plot! Nothing else needs to be said."
1,movie,I purchased Godzilla for my son for Christmas and we went to watch it and it only plays a third of the way through
3,"Not too bad, but......","Ok people. This movie doesn't deserved to be trashed as much as it has been. The movie was actually pretty poorly done, but there were good points. Think what you will, but the monster design was much better than the old one (Which, from me, is a massive compliment). The movie didn't really fall apart in my eyes until the movie lost focus on Godzilla and we got a bunch of BS about the creature rapidly reproducing. This is where the movie just got horrible. Another problem is Godzilla's shifting size. Still, with the new design, a more stable size, the elmination of the baby factor, and the return of Godzilla's radioactive plasma breath (It's NOT fire), a sequel could easily blow the japanese movies away. Still, if you're a big Godzilla fan, I'd suggest Marc Cerasini's series of novels. They present Godzilla as a far more powerful and unstoppable force than any movie ever has. Maybe they should make a movie based on those novels...."
5,"Well, I like it.","I don't know why everyone is putting down the new GODZILLA. They complain it doesn't look like the old one; well, they were told from the start to expect something new. They complain the script is weak; well, so are many of the Toho Godzilla movie scripts. But enough editorial. This movie is a special effects bash, with just the right touch of humor. Personally, I LOVED this movie. Even the human characters had appeal. Especially Animal and Mayor Ebert :-) I have all 22 Toho movies, so I know what I'm talking about. Buy GODZILLA today!"
4,Godzilla,"Godzilla gets a lot of hate but it's a really good movie. It is nothing at all like the original Godzilla, but if you take it for what it is you'll really like this movie. It's directed by Roland Emmerich who is the master of disaster movies and is sporting a decent enough cast. Where Godzilla really succeeds though is the scenes of the giant lizard rampaging through New York City causing chaos and destroying things. I know that all old school Godzilla fans will hate this but if you're just looking for a good fun movie to watch that will pass time you should check this out."
1,Emmerich should have done community service for making this,"He flat-out admitted he didn't like the original Japanese Godzilla, so why did he even bother making this? Why didn't Hollywood give the project to someone who was actually a fan of the series? Why did Toho give the OK to Emmerich in the first place? Oh yeah...money.This movie could have been passable on a superficial level if it was maybe 30 minutes shorter and didn't turn into a Jurassic Park rip-off half-way through. The effects are good and the action sequences are exciting enough, but it takes a while to get going, and most of the human characters are incredibly obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and stick with the decent Japanese Godzilla films like Gojira, Mothra vs. Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Biollante, or Godzilla vs. Destroyer (the latter two have yet to see decent DVD releases in the US)."
1,Derivative and Bland,"Godzilla is just one more sad product of a film industry more interested in lining its pockets than creating quality entertainment. The film is unimaginative, predictable, and entirely forgettable. The fact that the name of a beloved classic was besmirched in the process only adds insult to injury.Stay away from this mess and check out Jurassic Park, or even Cloverfield, instead. If you see Mathew Broderick give him a nice kick in the groin for signing on to this vapid and derogatory piece of trash. You can try to do the same to Jean Reno, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Crap.,"I often enjoy big, brainless action-fests (I even liked Double Team). I'm a fan of many (but not all) of the old Godzilla movies. However, neither of the mitigating factors above could keep me from detesting this ""film"". It just sucked. The filmmakers apparently saw The Lost World about thirty times, and copied all of it in a New York setting (along with rip-offs from King Kong and other classics). Tell me, just how does a 400 foot lizard stay hidden in the middle of a city? And did you notice that, every time Godzilla MIGHT have been wounded by something, everyone thought he was dead and started cheering? (And the monster is constantly referred to as ""he"", but with anything that big it shouldn't be hard to tell what gender it is.) By the way, even the special effects were bad. It was always obvious that Godzilla never existed anywhere except inside a computer. And the movie was an hour too long. And it didn't even look like Godzilla. And... sigh."
2,Writing Counts! It takes more than killer FX to make a movie,I feel bad for the wonderful Digital FX crew at Centropolis who put in the hours and the talent only to be let down by Director Roland Emerich and whoever wrote this totally flawed script. This was NOT written by a real screenwriter as every stupid mistake possible was made. Worst is the outright disrespect for the viewer's intelligence. For example in one scene an old man drops a fishing line off a dock into the east river and suddenly he hooks Godzilla who is at least a mile out to sea. Also this massive Creature simply disappears in midtown manhattan -- give me a break. This movie was annoying beyond belief. The DVD is worth getting only for the visual FX supervisor's comentary as the movie progresses.
2,A DVD to avoid,This DVD has good sound but has a huge shortage of plot. If you like the original Godzilla don't go near this turkey.
3,Not as bad as I had heard,"I, too, was afraid to waste my money, but I really like action shows. I was pleasantly surprised. I wish casting directors would forget Mathew Broderick (I will NEVER forgive them for casting him in Ladyhawke).Also, I can glady suspend belief and enjoy a ridiculous tale about giant lizards. I can't accept a smart scientist loving a dumb blonde no matter what bad things she does. How can special effects be so wonderful, and the characters suck so badly? Is it THAT hard to do a decent job with the 14 minutes these people are around?"
3,"A not-too-complicated,thrill ride of a film.A crowd pleaser!","Even though GODZILLA was dumped on big time by all the critics I think that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have accomplished another amazing spectacle. Even though the film wasn't that complicated I enjoyed it thoroughly,the special effects were amazing. Broderick did an excellent job, a likeable character, although throughout the film you may spot a couple of corny actors. This film was a real crowd pleaser and to tell you the truth I LOVED it! Buy it, I did."
4,"Big & loud. OK, size really does matter!",Godzilla is a fun movie especially with the subwoofer in gear! The menu treatments alone are worth the purchase price.
2,Good effects with a little bit of plot.,"The effects were unbelievable but the plot was a little too simple. All they said is that Godzilla was created during the nuclear winter in the Atlantic. That is too childish. They should have been a little more creative. Perhaps, Godzilla was a descender of the Dinosaurs that lived in the Bermuda triangle or something. They didn't think too hard to make this movie. But when it comes to graphics it is extraordinary."
1,awful awful,these guya tried to cash in after the succsess of id4 and made a ugly godzilla bad acting no script no story and just plain badness i would give it 0 stars if amazon had the option
1,This movie stinks,"Whatever you do, don't buy this movie. Broderick is terrible and there is no plot, just some big monster trashing New York. The special effects are mediocre, and anything else isn't worth mentioning. If it was possible to give this movie no stars I'd do so. To tell the truth, if you want anything about godzilla get the sound track, which is okay."
2,Jurasic Park3,"I can tell you right now that the producers should've made a third Jurassic Park movie. Actually, they already did. The dinosaur was a ripoff of the JP movies. The music score and production design were great, but that's it. Very disapointting."
1,Easily the worst movie I've ever seen.,"Godzilla did accomplish one remarkable feat -- even in today's vast field of cliched, brainless Hollywood action flicks, it managed to stand out as being mind-numbingly stupid. The only place this film belongs is in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Maybe then it might be marginally entertaining."
3,"As ""okay"" as they come","There really wasn't anything bad about this movie except that it really wasn't very good. The acting is mediocre, the special effects aren't bad and the script is so-so. It simply failed to rise above the normal the way that movies like Independance Day and Armageddon did. Watch it once but no more."
4,Not as bad as they say,"I am a hardcore G fan, so I can understand how my fellow Godzilla fans hate on this movie. I think most people are scared of the change this movie brought to the big guy. The effects are amazing, theres no arguing about that, it may nmt be our cup of tea but it is definitly a cool movie, and I overally like it."
3,Change the name on the cover,"If he's ""Zilla"" then change the name on the disc cover to that. Apparently he's called Zilla because they know he's not Godzilla. It might have gotten better ratings if the producers of this film didn't try to pass ""Zilla"" off as Godzilla. That's why I believe the Japanese came right behind them and made Godzilla 2000, then they took a shot at ""Zilla"" in Godzilla Final Wars by having the real Godzilla blow ""Zilla"" away."
3,Size does matter!,"When this movie premiered, my local town also premiered a 21 screen theater with digital Dolby stereo auditoriums that was soundproof from the screens on the next walls. That complex is still up and running, but Godzilla seemed to be a great way to break in a mammoth complex with state of the art screening. There is also an IMAX next door. So this movie holds fond memories of a giant way to begin a new era of multi screens, and those screens now boast 3D viewings for many movies. Popcorn & hot dogs never tasted so good. Edwards, Fresno, still rocks for the new century. Godzilla did me proud for the mind blowing effects, and anyone who takes the premise seriously shouldn't be living in America."
3,A good watch,"I'm not a Godzilla fan, but I am a fan of disaster movies. This movie by no means comes close to topping the list, but it was fun to watch. I own the DVD and Blu-ray, and the first thing I noticed with the blu-ray version is that the deleted scenes were... well, deleted. Maybe I missed it in some menu somewhere, but once you know the deleted scenes, its quite annoying when they aren't there. The picture quality is ok and doesn't seem that much better than the upconverted DVD."
1,Movie Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS FILM SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!! I was insulted that anyone would expect me to enjoy this never-ending painfully depressing movie, that tries to appeal to fans by making second-rate acting, and a terrible story, but make it all up to it's fans with quality visual effects. Okay, so the techinical stuff was cool. But as far as visual effects and sound quality goes, there are plenty of movies out there with much better visual effects, and sound, that also have a decent story, and decent acting. The point of all this is Godzilla was a terrible film, with a boring story, and characters who could have been disembowled by Godzilla and I would have not cared one bit."
1,Horrible,The movie is horrible. Acting is crummy. Godzilla is all messed up. I would get something better like Godzilla Vs. KingGhidora or Godzilla Vs. Spacegodzilla.
1,"It was just as bad as I though it was, and then some","Gee, this movie sure was pitiful. Not only was the lizard unrealistic looking, it was the typical average unimaginative green thing with mega fingernails. Where's the creativity? As usual, remakes of old masterpieces flop, and this is a prime example."
2,would be good if it wasn't godzilla,1.godzilla is not that WEAK!2.godzilla looks nothing like that!3.this movie make's godzilla look bad!all in all... horrible movie! godzilla can't even breath fire!
2,I like this!!! i like this movie allot...,"this movie blows!, i wasted a perfectly good 7 dollars and wasted 1 hour and 40 mins of my life!!!!!!! and after i watched it i threw it into my fire place and then buried the burnt to a crisp remains in a small pit in my back yardthe best part of the movie was the credits and an even better part was turning off my tv!, i did enjoy eating popcorn while watching it though, go ahead and rent it but dare not to buy it, owning this dvd is like a plague and will cause you to do drugs and will also cause spontaneous combustion to your tv, house, and viewers if this movie to get 1st and 2nd degree burns to the eyes and chest."
5,EEPS! GODZILLA!,"I thought it wuz a great film. It's pretty weird how the minute you think, "" Oh, this movie is over"" , a new prob pops up. Good good film."
4,Godzilla,"This was not the typical Godzilla movie. The special effects and storylines were good and well laid out. I think it was a more contemporary, fun and entertaining Godzilla. And don't forget the eggs...."
2,Crap,"I think movie reviews are funny because they really don't mean anything and everyones taste is differet. BUT, since Amazon wants me to write this, I will:This movie sucks. It's crap. It's a shame money that could've fed homeless people or even gotten homeless people off the streets was spent on the creation of this.OH, and then they put it in Blu-Ray! Even more money!We bought this for my father in law as he has no taste in movies. If you know someone like that, then please, buy this."
1,Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is so awful!!Go see the original Godzilla films instead!!The Godzilla on this movie is soooooooo verrry pathetic I mean he gets killed by helicopters!!And then the second half I wanted to puke!Attack of the baby Godzilla retards!It's a ripoff of Jurrasic Park which is better than this movie at least!!And finally the acting is so terrible especially Nick's girlfriend Audrie,my grandma could act better!!This movie is a disgrace to the original!!The original Godzilla could easily fry this monster into a crisp!!Hell the origanal Godzilla could stomp this monster into the freaking ground!!Let's pray this movie never get's a sequel!!"
3,GODZILLA is on vacation and anothor one takes place,I did not like this verison Godzilla is so weak!!! He cries and yells in pain with 1 bullit he gets killed in 4 rocket launchers. The Old version is better This ovie is not good this is not godzilla this must be his Weak Cousin BOOOOOO!!!! BOOOOOO!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!
4,Movie critics can kiss my ---,"i hate movie critics, i honestly hate them. what a job to sit, watch a movie, and bad mouth it. and to think roger ebert's getting paid to be a pessamist! GODZILLA was an awesome movie. good acting, great music score, record breaking special effects...this movie has everything a giant-lizard-attacking-NYC movie should have. Hank Azaria and Jean Reno delivered mind boggling performances and i enjoyed all of the historic landmarks getting destroyed. GODZILLA was much better than the original japanese films. nothing against them or anything, i'm just saying that in Emmerich and Devlin's GODZILLA, you can't see the zipper."
1,"Please, Hollywood, please!","Sitting on my sofa two nights ago, I caught Godzilla on The Movie Channel. I decided to watch it, and realized soon after that it will be one decision I will regret for the rest of my days. Who went to the theater to see this? And why? Special effects that weren't even well-crafted, a hokey-pokey plot that lets viewers down at every turn, acting that totally bites the big one, and the overall effect that this movie was made in the hopes that it would gross mucho money. There was hardly anything surprising in this film, the special effects were horribly done. Every lizard, while supposed to have a scary feel, always looks computer generated, and should only scare the computer animators. The acting is flat and lifeless, which seems to be what wins over most audiences these days. A big Hollywood no-no by all accounts."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I GIVE A 1 STAR TO THE DVD NOT THE MOVIE. JUST SOME NEWS FOR YOU GUYS. DON'T BUY THIS DVD. I BROUGHT IT LAST MONTH AND FOUND OUT THAT A COLLECTOR'S EDITION DVD WILL BE RELEASED. SEE BELOW.Sony has set The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold, G (2005), a G/You Got Served 2-pack, Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King - Special Edition, Godzilla: The Series - Monster Mayhem, Godzilla: The Series - Mutant Madness, a new Godzilla: Special Edition (the Roland Emmerich film), and a Left Behind Collection 3-pack (including Left Behind: The Movie, Left Behind: Tribulation and Left Behind: World at War) all for release on 3/28."
2,This is what happens when people try to use special effects to compensate for actual quality,"The reason this is rated two stars is because one is the minimum, and I thought I should at least give it something for the effort. It';s obvious that a lot of effort went into this. No, i'm not gonig to give any pretence that this effort pays off or that it makes the movie worth buying. There are only three reasons to buy this, which are as follows:1) If you found it as part of a G Movie box and buying the box is cheaper than buying the other G Movies individually.2) If you're extremely bored and want a movie that's over two hours because you believe that watching it has to at least be better than doing nothing3) If you want a perfect example of how 21st millenium movie directors (mostly in America, but occasionally in countries like England and Korea) prioritise special effects, the least important part of any movie, above anything else."
1,Another Squandered Opportunity,"You turned Godzilla into a pregnant iguana.You had her running--RUNNING--from the military.You cast Ferris Bueller as a scientist with some long Greek name.You then ripped off JURASSIC PARK by having a climax in Madison Square Garden with hundreds of mini-Godzillas, which might have been really cool--if we hadn't seen the Raptors in JURASSIC PARK I, II, and III.How could Hollywood screw up a Godzilla movie?It's not like it was very high bar to jump to begin with, but all the money and special effects and resources of American cinema can't buy imagination."
1,Its all about the lizzard,"I can remember as a kid,always loving Godzilla.I loved watching the old 1950&1960's Japanese films.This one however,is a far cry from any of the classics,and sets itself up in history as one of the ""Big Block Buster Boobs"" of the summer.Kids will love the movie for the moster,because it does look impressive on screen,and the special effrects are fantastic.The story is ok,but infentile at best.It was very predictacble,but I think the story itself was engineered that way.All in all,I would'nt pay a red cent to own it,it really is'nt worth it."
1,Godzilla or Jurassic Park?,People who rate this as 5 star i mean what in movie you thought was cool.I thoguth it was interesting until they showed godzillaI was like Tyranosarus Rex with Spikes what the hell happen to Godzilla.Then from then on the movie sucked.People rate this as 5 stating that its better then a moth showing up and better then those cheesy flicks??? OK I guess I mean it seems some of these people never saw godzilla movies and mean I dont blame them but how you going to compare with new technology then old technologyof course the new is going to be better.Special effects are good I have to say but not Godzilla.You got little godzilla bastards running around like wannabe Raptors trying to kill people?Im telling If you a G fan this movie was not so hot if you want to buy it I suggest you Buy Jurassic Park cus you will see alot moreof dinosaurs then this movie.
1,If only ...,"If they'd called it something else - say, IGUANZILLA - I might have gone to see it in the theatres. But I KNEW they'd screw up the look and feel of the legend.GODZILLA without:- strontium 90 breath and glowing spines- moody soundtrack which has been consistent since the '54 original- regeneration which makes him almost invulnerable- cheezy human super-weapons- 'evil' monster opponent (optional)just isn't the Godzilla which has captured the imagination of a couple of generations of theatre goers. Any more than trying to do a remake of A CHRISTMAS CAROL and leaving out Tiny Tim and the Ghosts. MAYBE a potential sequel could be saved IF we find out the newly-hatched baby has mutated yet more and turns out being more like the Japanese version. Oh, and hire the guy who orchestrated the Japanese version's soundtrack, too."
1,What a waste of my life,"This movie that I refere to as G.I.N.O is terrible. The directors were trying to make a Godzilla movie and they failed. That thing was not Godzilla. The only similarity was that they called it Godzilla. The monster could run up to 200 mph but only used its speed to run away from helicopters! The real Godzilla wouldn't have done that. Plus, its head was real differant and its spikes were all weird looking. Also, I could easily tell that Gino was a CGI creature. In other words, poor CGI. The main story was really dumb. Gino lays a nest and all the babies hatch. It should have been more like battle another monster in order to be a Godzilla movieSPOILER: In the end the stupid iguana died because six missiles hit him! Then the heart beating scene was a terrible rip-off from King Kong.Overall this movie BOMBED! The DVD was okay, the special features were just not very good accept for the Featurett. If you're looking for a Godzilla movie then this is not one of them."
3,There's only one godzilla and he's not it!,"I liked the movie but he does not deserve the godzilla name, and there's only one, and in my opinion he does't deserve that name. It should be called Giant lizard attacks New York. But I still liked the movie."
2,"Broderick 1 star, Special Effects 1 star",I honestly did'nt like Godzilla. A couple things I said are the only bright spots of the movie...and that's about all.
2,"CAMERA-SHY, SIZE-SHIFTING KANGAROO-LIZARD","EVEN ROGER EBERT AGREES: this movie stinks. I know that the ""old"" Godzilla was just a guy in a dinosaur suit, but I liked it! Now here's a monster that seems to change in size every scene. For exanple, in one scene it is only 50 feet tall(when it's taking the fish), and then it can use skyscrapers as stairs and can fill an entire subway tunnel. AND NOW THEY'RE MAKING A SEQUEL?!"
2,"Eh, I don't know what to say","I mean it. I really don't know what to say. This movie had so much potential to be the best Godzilla movie ever made, but Devlin and Emmerich screwed around with it and made it into one of the worst G movies. The special effects are incredible, but that's it. Matt Broderick just doesn't look fascinated enough by the monster to make his reaction believable. And this is some of the worst acting and lamest one-liners I've ever seen in an action movie. And they used the classic Godzilla's roar!!! It just doesn't sound right coming out of a giant iguana. And the blowing up of Madison Square Garden looks like it was done last minute. But, just the fact that this movie had so much potential, but the that's all it was. Potential. The end effect is a bad movie with good special effects."
2,Godzilla was okay in this movie!,"this was not what I expected. I mean my mom and I love the Japanese movies with Godzilla fighting different monsters. But in this one he just running around desroying everything in Manhattan,New York. The movie would have been better if Godzilla was fighting a monster. I added this movie one star because I like the effects on Godzilla and there are only three scenes on this movie I like. The one when Godzilla was just entering the city. Near the end when Godzilla's eggs were hatching and the babies were roaming the building chasing the four main characters.Godzilla got trapped on the Brooklyn bridge and he got shot four times(I think). This movie had only a couple of good scenes but overall it wasn't that good throughout the movie."
2,Godzilla 1998 (US),"First of all, let me just say... this new ""godzilla"" doesn't cut it. I mean, he is nothing but a big giant wussy thing. He gets caught up in a suspension bridge, gets hit with about 6 to 10 missiles (I don't have an exact count) and THAT kills him? COME ON! What's up with that? He's nothing compared to the old godzilla.I grew up watching old godzilla movies where the people were dubbed in, and those really entertained me. That godzilla is cool because he is unstoppable! Out of all the hundreds and hundreds of missiles and rockets and bullets and bombs that have hit him, none have really killed him!The reason that I gave the movie 2 stars is because it has a really cool nuclear test in the beginning.In conclusion, I don't believe that this thing deserves to be called ""godzilla""."
2,"Not a Disaster, but it Comes VERY Close.","""Godzilla"" is just like the creature after which it's named: big, loud, and without direction. The plot only serves as an excuse for the movie, and the special effects are PlayStation silly. Matthew Broderick looks blank and does little to spice things up, and the dialogue is choppy. Oh, the soundtrack has a single from P. Diddy, who annoys me to no end. I can't say ""Godzilla"" is a complete disaster, but for an effects-heavy summer popcorn flick, you can do way better than this."
1,What happened???,"This had some of the elements for a great movie: Godzilla and a big budget. But the bad elements, bad acting and no plot, ruined the film.What we got was a boring, stupid, overblown mess. I assume the makers of this dreck got bored too since that had to throw in that terrible ""love story"" subplot and the ""baby Godzillas"". Even feeding Matthew Broderick to Godzilla at the film's start would not have saved this awful, awful movie."
5,See it again!,"Solid monster noir, with a title creature who's character traits rivals the best work of Ray Harryhausen, no joke! A nolstalgic celebration of 50's atomic monster movies imploded unto 90's eyeball kicks, with none of the cynicism of Armageddon. Best Cg creature of all time!"
1,This Stinks!!!,All that hype...for what? This movie stinks like a clogged up toilet! Thia cheesefest was all special effects and dumb one liners! And who would ever believe that cab chase scene at the end?
2,Not worth the hype,"What happened here? We were hyped into thinking it'd be a psychotic pyros-laden joyride, and it turned out to be a rain-soaked hunt for a pregnant iguana who's never shown totally in one shot! The acting isn't a huge improvement over the Japanese dubs, the plot is the same as all the radioactive monster on the loose films, and the monster itself is never seen clearly because of all the rain (clever trick since the monster looks so dumb, with its gangly arms and Leno-size chin.) The monster itself is a wimp compared to the old Godzilla, who would have eaten NYC for breakfast and shrugged off the volley of missiles that ended up doing the iguanasaurus in. The FX were pretty good, although you could tell they were CG. Not as good as the Japanese outings."
1,Please don't do this again,"Well, Jean Reno was cool...a bit comic - like he wasn't in the same movie as the rest of the cast or G. It really bugged me the way the directors wanted to make G to an animal with instincts and motherhood instead of malice. The only point that it lights up is the chase but by then I was already dead. Roland and Emmerich's G is really streamlined and could have been scary. I'm sorry it's not. Just to top it of the very worst lines are in the end of movie proving my theory that even the writers couldn't go the distance."
2,A sound effects gourmet!,"Ok, let's get one thing down before this review goes any further: this movie is a two-star movie on the basis of its storyline. There are some elements of the film which will give viewers a few surprises, but overall, it is an example of a lack of intelligent filmmaking.However, on the basis of sound design, this movie is one of the best films ever. From the very beginning of the film, the soundtrack exhibits excellent qualities when it comes to utilizing the .1 LFE, from the vintage footage of H-bomb testing to the giant lizard thundering through the streets of New York City. Almost every scene, whether it has to do with the musical score or the sound effects of the scene, the surround sound is fully enveloping. There is no other way to describe this DVD: the sound design alone makes it a must for anyone into sound effects design."
3,Should have a different title.,"The movie itself wasn't that bad....rather cliche'd but what movie isn't no days. I just think it should have had a differnt title.....this wasn't godzilla as he should have been portrayed. Godzilla never ran from a fight, godzilla was more of a threat....let's face it this creature was a wimp compared to the big G. Watch the movie for fun....just don't expect GODZILLA."
3,Good Movie. But that's not Godzilla,"I enjoyed this film when it first came out. The only problem is The monster isn't Godzilla. I've seen their first designs of the monster for this film and it totally looks like Godzilla, they should have stuck with those. Instead they made him into a giant weak lizard. What I did like about this monster is that it did move like a dinosaur. The crew said they tried to make it more like ""The Beast from 20,000 fantoms"" which was the Grandfather of Godzilla. If that was the case, they should have called it ""The Beast"". But this film wasn't bad."
5,SO glad I found these!,I couldn't find sheets for the mini co sleeper anywhere except on amazon. The sheets are great and fit perfectly. The are way safer than trying to put an ill-fitting sheet on the co-sleeper and/or not put a sheet on at all.
3,"Item is great, price is too expensive!","I purchased the mini co-sleeper which is great. However, I was very upset to find out that the sheets were $15 a piece, especially when you need at least 2-3!! What a rip off. I would suggest trying to find a generic fitted sheet at a store that would fit and sew on some velcro."
1,NOT 100% Cotton as indicated in description,"Upon receipt of the sheets, I read the description indicating the sheet is 65% polyester and 35% cotton. The description for the item provided by Arm's Reach and sold by Baby Bungalow state made of 100% cotton. Very disappointing. Between the cost and the shipping, this product is substandard.Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Fitted Sheet"
3,Co-sleeper sheets from Target,"The product is fine - it fits, though the sheets are a bit rough; that will probably change with repeated washings.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM THROUGH TARGET. The shipping costs were ridiculous."
2,Not 100% cotton,"We ordered this sheet because the price seemed reasonable, and it was advertised as 100% cotton. Received a natural sheet, as ordered, but it was 65% polyester and 35% cotton. We saw this same problem in someone else's review. These are sheets from the Arm's Reach company. Seems like they've changed their composition, or Amazon hasn't updated the website to reflect the product they're selling. Be aware."
2,Not so great,"The velcro that attaches to the mattress does keep the sheets snug, but getting the sheet off requires some force and can pull too [...] the seams of the bed. I don't trust that no damage is going to occur.I bought the expensive organic sheet from Arm's Reach for the mini co-sleeper, and I like it because the velcro does not attach. Maybe that's a flaw, but it is so much easier to get on and off (and avoid damaging the bed), and it's plenty snug. Plus, no pesticides used with it."
4,Worked For Me,"A little pricey, and a bit on the thin side, but these sheets fit perfectly. I tried to get away with using some off brand ones and had issues with them bunching."
5,PERFECT FIT!,"This sheet is strong enough to protect the baby from scratching or any other danger related to sleeping on the bare mattress. However, it is also soft and gentle for a good baby sleep! Excellent product."
2,I don't like Polyester,Just received my mini co-sleeper sheet. Will return it. I did not notice but it's 65% polyester. I myself would never choose to sleep on a poly sheet. Why should my baby? Hardly anything could be better than cotton for a baby's sheet!.
2,scratchy sheet,I wish another company made sheets that fit the Arm's Reach cosleeper because this sheet is not of such great quality. It's not soft even after washing. For the price they should have made a better product.
2,Why are these so expensive?,"Arm's Reach really knows how to rob people. These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them. I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind. But considering that this is an item that you'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up, it pains me to pay full price for them. The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed (possibly b/c of all the velcro?). I've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage. But, if you're the type of person who does everything by the book, the air drying can be inconvenient if you don't have another clean sheet on hand."
5,I like it better than the sheet that came with the crib,Nice sheet. I hang it to dry and it dries quickly. Stains seem to come out better on this sheet than the one that came with the crib and I think it has a better feel to it.
3,"not good for ferrets, but...","Are treats supposed to be good for anyone?My ferrets love anything that tastes like peanut butter, so this is their favorite treat. I mix it with a larger portion of healthy food and give this mixture to them every other day as a treat. MODERATION."
3,Drab But Relevant,to the economic times the world is going through. Middle aged men are often terrified of starting a new career from scratch and this story shows the lengths one man will go to save face in front of his family and friends. I like that he wasn't a victim and that perhaps this was a phase he had to go through. It's a little depressing for my tastes though.
2,Moody nonsense,"Evidently getting fired or laid off in France is more traumatic than in the US, judging by this film in which a man is so freaked that he can't tell his family he's jobless. Instead, he kills time hanging around and eventually sinks to selling counterfeit goods with a semi-crook. In the end, he gets a new white collar job. More than two hours of moody non-action. You're never quite sure what's going on, but actually very little is. I don't understand the great reviews. It also pictures an uglier side of French suburbia I didn't know existed."
2,Intriguing & dull,"Ok, it is boring..... ~ 1 hour of watching a guy drive around? please.....But it is also intriguing. What makes this guy ""tick""? How will he resolve this mess he's created.No masterpiece, no bomb, but interesting in a thoughtful (not action) way"
1,Take a time out-please!,"'Time Out' is a typical French film in that nothing much happens. It is at first a relief not to be confronted with explosions, shootings, computer-generated aliens, or the other staples of Hollywood films. There is, however, nothing of substance to hold one's attention. After two hours of watching the lead character wander around trying to convince others (perhaps even himself) that he has something 'big' in the works, I finally screamed at the screen. ENOUGH ALREADY! It's simply BORING and LONG. Perhaps the director is trying to communicate to us the feeling of hopelessness and restlessness that the unemployed main character is experiencing. That's just what we need: the cinematic equivalent of waiting in the unemployment line. No thank you!Those who are about to snore salute you!!!----------NOT RECOMMENDED EXCEPT FOR THOSE WITH INSOMNIA---"
3,A good place to start studying with this book but you need +,"The Master Plumbers exam in Hawaii is a very poor test, This one book will not get you passed.Hold this thought I'm a Licensed master plumber meaning I took the test in these other States and passed already, MP in Co., MP, NM, MP in AZ& Hi.. I ignorantly thought this one book & my 50 years of plumbing would get me passed NO, I had to take test twice to get a passing score, but the Hawaii test was written by an idiot that some one first knocked their brains out.Do your home work, If you ask and discover fail rate is excessive, find a test prep class specific to your State, you'll be Money ahead. I don't wish to malign the book seller just help you pass exam."
4,Excellent,"The only flaw is that the straps are a bit too flimsy. Otherwise, the tap valve is great and a lot quicker than other kinds of valves."
2,Too Much but Not Enough,"The book tries to cover everything about the 1911 but does not give much detail. A page or two on each subject. If your looking for real information on buying or reworking a Colt 1911, this is not the book you want."
1,"1911 Enthusiasts ""Must Have"" Book","If you have an interest in the 1911 pistol, you can't be without this book. Comprehensive both historically as well as mechanically when it comes to this great pistol model."
5,It's a Classic...,"All four of the Karate Kid movies contain great wisdom from Mr. Miyagi! Definitely worth watching and owning. Other than a little bad language, they are safe for the whole family. We find ourselves quoting Mr. Miyagi frequently after watching these!"
4,"The Karate kid box set , -1","I absolutely love the Karate kid trilogy. It's actually what got me into martial arts in the first place. 1, 2, and 3 are pure heart and brilliance in my opinion. The beggining, the journey and the return. Part 2 is my favorite simply because its the only one I owned as a child which I recorded off of TV during Hurricane Hugo in th 80's. Which is quite Ironic if youve seen the second part. Now that the movies are DVD we can all enjoy the great movies of our younger years, as well as extra features whcih I couldnt believe. Anyway, I recomend the box set to anyone any fan of any of the movies, save the 4th. (movie which does not count)."
4,Great Classic 80's Flicks!,"For those that grew up in the 80's, these are a must-have nostalgia collection! First two are top notch, with the third one coming in as just ok ('bad guy' & 'love interest girl' really did a poor job of acting), with the 4th a nice finish to the series. Worth the price I paid for it so I'm happy with the purchase!"
3,5 stars if you throw disc 3 away,"The whole family loved part 1, and part 2 was even pretty good. But, the whole experience will be ruined if you watch part 3. Part 3 is ridiculously awful. The villains are so extremely evil, it's very unsettling to watch. You keep waiting for something good to happen, but it never does, until that last 3 seconds of the movie.. BUT, that doesn't even come close to fixing the extreme dilemma. The team of villains, lead by an infinitely rich psychopath, end up with even more reason (not that they ever really had any reason in the first place) to continue torturing Daniel. If you want to feel good after the movie, then stop after part 1 or 2. Part 3 will leave you wishing for a part 4 where ALL of the evil predators get mauled to death by lions."
5,great gift set,"It was very hard to find the movies at local retailers so I was so excited to find the whole set for only $20. And it was delivered within 3 days of ordering it, just in time for Christmas!"
3,Sportsfan,The films are entertaining for kids and adults alike. One very disappointing thing is that there is no indication that all the formats are wide screen. There is nothing on the packaging or the description ot the item.
5,Does It Get Any Better?,"In the 80s we saw some huge Blockbusters and modern day Classics. IMO, The Karate Kid (1-3) is a modern day Classic. Part 4 just isn't what the first three were, but I don't know that it is right to do a comparison.This is something that every DVD own should have in their collection. The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is the only thing that can compare.Pure Greatness."
4,"""Good Karate Kid Set!""","Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and Hilary Swank star in these drama films.The Karate Kid- (1984) A bullied teen befriends a Japanese handymanwho teaches him karate. The Karate Kid II- (1986) Mr. Miyagi facesan old foe and his nephew while visiting Okinawa with Daniel. TheKarate Kid III- (1989) Daniel and Mr. Miyagi face a karate champhired by Kreese and his war friend. The Next Karate Kid- (1994)Mr. Miyagi takes an angry 17-year old girl under his wing. Theseare great films and it's nice to have them together. Each havegood picture and sound plus some neat extras. Get this goodset."
3,The Karate Kid Part 2 review,"It's not as good as the first one but it also not that bad. Even though it had it sappy moments it continued the story and it wasn't a cheap remake of the first one like part 3. Overall,rent it not buy it. I give this disc a 6 out of 10."
3,Karate Kid part II,"The movie is great. The sound does not go along with the people talking. In other words, the tracking is off. This is the only problem I could see."
3,Not as good as the first.,"Although not as good as part I, Karate Kid II is still a worthy sequel which is almost as good as the original.The movie starts off where part I ended right after the tournament. Miyagi has some issues he needs to resolve in Japan -the homeland of Karate- and allows Daniel-sahn to go with him. The entire movie, in fact, transpires in Japan, where both Miyagi and Daniel-sahn encounter personal problems of their own, namely from bullies, and are forced to resort to karate to solve them. While the movie has interesting Japanese cultural elements throughout, the final fight scene wasn't exactly spectacularly-choreographed and turned cheesy when Daniel-sahn uses clasped open palms to slap the crap out of his enemy, his inspiration being a chorus of wooden paddles being sounded simultaneously. Still, not a bad flic."
4,pretty good,"i hear many bad things about this movie, but i find this film pretty good. not as good as the first one, but i think it's great. good acting and a good story. really, this movie is not bad."
1,BEST Movie EVER! Worst Extras DVD!,I love this film! I want everyone to still buy this dvd! The movie is the best film ever made.but..The DVD Extras are terrible! I couldn't even get through the Commentary Track. I hate when they have 3 or 4 people all trying to talk at once! They should have made 2 SEPERATE Commentary Tracks!!1 with Pat & Ralph1 with the Director & Writer.NOT all on one track talking over each other.
2,Cheap Packaging,The movies are good but they put III and IV on the same disk and therefore in the same case - pretty cheap if you ask me.
5,Karate Kid still a favorite with pre-teen boys,"Enjoyed the movies again after all these years. I think that this is a feel good film set to watch with your child, especially one that has faced bullies. There isn't maybe a karate championship in most kids futures, but it opens the door to talking about being a new kid or a kid that is the target of bullies. Also, it is a sweet, happy ending film that gives a glimpse of Japan and you can watch it without worry as it is family friendly."
3,It was good.....a long time ago,"well I have to admit that I liked this movie when it first came out and I was 12. The mystery of Karate and of Japan was Fascinating. Well now I'm an American living in Japan and I have to tell everyone out there that they have Japan (Okinawa), the culture, the people, and even karate ALL WRONG. I find the movie more humorous than entertaining. They don't have karate fights in the streets like the movies....."
2,AS to the question what happen to Elizabeth,"It was Mentioned that She left him for a football player right after the fight. Ahhh doesn't make sense, but niether does part 3.I think this is a ok sequel it ain't bad, but it ain't good either.The storyline is pretty bad, but we get alot of good Cinema Moments that help this film.still.... bad Sequel."
1,Makes the first Karate Kid seem like a documentary,"The first Karate Kid movie was, let's face it, completely unbelievable. But still it was an enjoyable fairy tale for kids as well as adults and the relationship between Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio went along way toward bringing charm to the story. This movie, however, takes the apprenticeship to ludicrous extremes, continuing to emphasize its already dubious premise that a martial art is something that can be quickly and easily mastered. Somehow ""the kid"" and Miyagi end up in Japan, getting involved in local hi-jinks, and even more unbelievable tournament than in the first film, and some old rival of Miyagi's who practically stalks him like a serial killer. To this day, I can still hear him uttering that infamous threatening line: ""Three Days, Miyagi, THREE DAYS!!!"" Where's Jerry Zucker and the Airplane crew when you need them?"
2,Poor Sequel,i tought the sequel didn't live up to the 1st version. i guess its just a typical sequel. the god father part 2 is the only good sequel and i still know what..... the sequel also should have had elizabeth shue cuz she was fiiiiiiiiiiine!!!!!
3,Present!,Nothing to say. This is why I do not fill out these things. I do not want to write a required number of words. It is a pain in the rump.
3,What happened to Elizabeth?,"In my opnion, the first Karate Kid was by far the superior film. However, the different cultural setting and new characters in the 2nd do keep the movie interesting. Still, I agree with the question, what happened to Elizabeth Shue. Granted, she was a little over-weight in those days, but dang...it's Elizabeth Shue!"
1,What a total rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Here I sit anxiously awaiting my boxed set, just busting at the seams at the opportunity to see KKI in widescreen. I am a huge KK fan ... I have the first one on Beta, VHS, and DVD. I also have the soundtrack on cassette and CD. I have the paperback book versions, some of the action figures, and the script. I love this film; I know this film. I just popped the DVD in and to my dismay I see that even though the box says remastered for HD, absolutely nothing was done to clean the film up. It has the same dust specks in it that the original DVD had in it. What's worse, this isn't even widescreen!!!!! The lowlifes simply cut off the top and bottom of the original and called it widescreen. I compared it to my original full screen and you are missing parts of the picture. I am very very disappointed and will be seeking to get my money back due to their false advertising."
5,Great buy,This was a great buy and I am very happy with the purchase. The item was in great condition and arrived promptly. Thank you so much.
3,Still not believable,"Ralph Maccio is simply too young and too soft looking to be credible in the role of an ultimately super tough karate fighter. And the puppy love continues from the original film, only they had to ditch the first girl friend and provide a beautiful young (but older looking than Ralphie) Japanese girl who immediately takes to our hero for no discernible reason. In the end, the antagonist is just too tough looking and tough behaving to make the ending plausible. Like the original, mildly diverting if you have nothing better to do."
5,blast from the past,"these movies are just as great as i remembered them...ralph macchio was hot in the 80s, skinny, but he pulled it offpat morita has got to be the coolest neighbor everand watching the karate kid II reintroduced me to a great peter cetera song: the glory of loveso rock on ralph macchio, peter cetera, and pat moritaoh yeah, hilary swank get's in on it at the end too"
4,Karate Kid Collection,High quality visual detail and sound reproduction. A decent must see classic :)
4,Notation,The book is good if you can read the old notation. It left me frustrated from time to time because I'm so used to the new notation (ex. 1.e4)
2,"Teaches the openings to be even, not to win","The author shows a game and in the same game there are 600 variations. Very difficult to play thru.As well, the author will gave an example of an opening and after 10 moves claim - both sides even: Why learn an opening to be even, learn an opening to win."
1,Well built useless radio,The radio was really well built and looked great. However it could not hold a station and was pretty useless as a radio.
2,FM and Shortwave Pocket Radio but No AM Band,"I was going to get one of these radios, but the radio is missing the AM band on it what if they would just make another model with LW and AM bands, you basic 145.0 to 300.0 kHz and 520.0 to 1710.0 kHz bands. It's a good radio but it needs the long wave and AM broadcast bands. I hope that Hummer will make a radio with AM/FM/Shortwave."
2,OK,"The amount of light output by this device, requires you to be up close, and is not great at illuminating more than one subject."
4,"Good seller, OK product",Had a smooth experience with the seller. Product was delivered prior to the expected dates.
4,Small but pricey,"I just received the HVL-HFL1 (video light and flash). It is small, light and compact but since I ordered, I realize the HVL-HL1 (video light only) is available and is about $100 less. Since the DVD-403 comes with a flash (albeit small), I am going to return and reorder the HVL-HL1 which is about $40. The video light was the main reason for ordering this for me. If you do want the flash capability, it does look well built and stylish (and did I say small). I guess the small size is a benefit of using the camcorder battery (rather than built in)."
4,great Leatherman,I bought this for my son-in-law who lives in Alaska. He had another model that kept closing up onto his hands while he was using it. He loves this. He raves to everyone how great this leatherman is and how wonderful I was to buy it. (My daughter gave me the hint that he wanted it.) I will be buying my grandson one in a few more years. Great item!
4,"Everyting in One, but it bites some times!","I love the ability to open the knives without opening the whole tool! I also love the micro screw driver and the ability to change out bits for allen keys and square drive. It is the best multi-tool I've ever owned. My only problem is that when you squeeze it together there is a pinch point and I've gotten two blood blisters from it in the 9 months I've been using it. I also wish it had a spring return for the jaws. I have a wingman that has this feature and I love it. The wingman is a very great multi-tool as well. Much lighter than the wave, but far fewer tools. They are both great. This is a heavy tool so if you are looking for something lighter the wingman is a great option, but if you want it all this is the one for you. I definitely noticed the weight on my belt so I ended up going to a BDU style belt to hold this and my mini mag light. Spec-ops Better BDU is awesome for this and made in USA unlike many others."
5,Good pocket tool for the price,Bought this a few weeks ago and love it! I don't really have anything bad to say about it....like that it comes with different bits for the screwdriver.
3,"A Slow Beginning, But Worth the Wait","If you can tolerate the slow beginning, this book has an intriguing premise. At the 1933 World's Fair, a young father races through the crowds, with a premature baby in a hatbox, to Dr. Leo Hoffman. Hoffman raises money for his premature baby hospital and research by exhibiting the tiny babies in glass incubators to the public at fairs.By nightfall, the young man is dead outside a tavern on the fair grounds, the baby is safely ensconced in an incubator with filtered oxygen, and we are introduced to the characters next door to the hospital - Caro, the stripper/dancer and her dwarf-like cousin, St. Louis, who acts as a body guard.The characters are interesting and the story moves along after the slow start until the last dozen pages when the story takes an odd and inexplicable turn that leaves you feeling like something important flashed by without you noticing it. But Brown's writing shows great promise and her next book should be an interesting one as well."
2,"Yeah, the ending...","The title was intriguing enough to make me pick up this book and I read it just a few hours because it held my interest so. I do love that in a book. But I too was sorely disappointed in the non-ending. I guess it just depends on if you want to really think and come up with your own ending or if like me, you don't have time to read much fiction and really just like to be entertained. Though I enjoyed reading it, I always feel like I've wasted time when it doesn't end ""right."" For that reason, I likely will not read any more from this author."
2,The ending is missing...,"The book is interesting, especially the part about the babies and their nurses...but the ending just isn't there. It's as if she got to that point and couldn't come up with any good resolutions.The book starts slow, lots of background info that seems to drag on and on.Guess I have to say I was really disappointed in this one."
2,I just couldn't get into it!,"I love books about neonatology, so I thought that I would really like this book. Boy was I wrong. I only got to page 30, and ended up returning the brand-new book. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the story, but I didn't like the writing at all, so I decided to stop. Just to let you know, I am a very avid reader, and enjoy almost every book I read. This just wasn't a keeper. My advice: before you buy this book, read all of the reviews, or borrow it from the library."
5,Exquisite,"I first heard ""Perfect Time"" on the late-night New Age program, ""Echoes."" The lyrics made me sit up and stare at the stereo -- Christian music on ""Echoes""? It's now one of my most treasured CDs. I'm trying to memorize ""Gra De"", which isn't easy since I don't have the Gaelic. I've recommended this recording to many of my friends, Christian and nonChristian, musical and nonmusical, because it is exquisitely lovely, spiritual without commercialism."
5,Beautiful Christian Celtic Music,Maire has accomplished something in this cd which few people have. She's compiled a cd of Christian music in her Celtic/World music style that is both reverent and yet not stifling. It is very beautiful and relaxing. The detail of having some Celtic lyrics included gives the music an almost mystical element. I very much recommend it to everybody. It is my favorite of her cds.
2,"Ok, but...","This CD is Ok...but, don't listen to those who say the Christan message is not to imposing, because it is! All she sings about is Jesus, Jesus and, yes, Jesus. Not that that is nessicarily a bad thing but...And all the songs seem to have the same tune...Well, if all this is Ok with you, then, by all means,go ahead and buy it!"
2,"Her singing is gorgeous, but . . .","Maire Brennan's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful, and for most this can be rated a fabulous album. You need to understand, however, that this is a decidedly, in your face, unavoidably christian album. For those, like me, who are recovering from christianity, it was an unpleasant surprise, but not one for which I will fault or judge Maire Brennan. I just wish I had realized it before I had bought the album. It would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category."
4,Refreshingly new,"I've read the critic's on this CD. It's the first time I've listened to Maire Brennan and I found her CD refreshingly new. I love celtic sounds and the contents of her songs convinced me that this is not another CD who only uses Christianity to ""sell"" their CD's (which I have found on oither ""christian"" CD's). I enjoy this CD very much and do recommend it."
4,loved it!,"I own several Enya albums but had never heard of Marie Brennan untill one day when I walked into a store and heard her album playing over the sound system there. Brennan offers hanuting celtic melodies mixed with lyrics about faith. If you enjoy Enya, check out Maire as well!"
2,Lacks syncopation and variety,"As a listener I pay attention to the music, not the words, so I am not making a comment on the quality of the lyrics. I purchased this album after owning Whisper to the Wild Water and Misty Eyed Adventures and was disappointed. Misty Eyed Adventures had a wonderful quirkyness and stylistic variety to it and Whisper to the Wild Water had wonderful melodies carried forward by moving sycopated beats and great arrangements. Perfect Time plods along and I find it bland. I would not buy it again."
4,Very good introduction to Tai Chi Chen Style basic steps,This Video is a very good introduction to Tai Chi Chen Style basic steps.It helps you practise and feel the special (Silk Rolling) mooves of Chen Style Taichi.But its price (more then 40 or 50us$) seems too high to me for one introductory DVD (amongst 4) to a martial art.
5,This is a must have if you're serious about studying Chen Tai Chi Chuan!,"This DVD set is one of the most well put together and demonstrated self-teaching series I've seen so far. Sifu Jose Figueroa has taken movements from the Chen Tai Chi form and broken them down into their essential components and applied them to Silk Reeling - Chan Ssu Chin. He shows each movement from front back and sides as well as explains in easy to understand terms, how to practice the movement.Excellent Job!"
4,an MBA degree in less than two hours !,"------- not nearly as salacious as valley of the dolls, but far more human. nor is it as zany as earthgirls are easy. it absolutely nails the slightly drug-hazed days of the '70s, but doesn't forget that business has to make a profit. kind of a male fantasy (but also kind of a female fantasy - warren beatty is as beautiful a guy as one'll ever see . . .) without all the in-n-out of the skin-flicks.Big"
1,"Shampoo, the review","Why one star? The DVD I received is a European version and won't load in my DVD player. This after waiting weeks and weeks for the arrival of the Shampoo DVD (including reading a bunch of Hollywood-insider stuff like books from Sydney Lumet, Joe Eszterhas, and Julia Phillips) and re-watching Chinatown (written by Robert Towne who penned Shampoo), Harold and Maude (directed by Hal Ashby, Shampoo's director) and Being There (also directed by Ashby and FWIW, quite terrible). So there you have it: too much anticipation followed by a DVD that won't work in America. Buyer beware."
1,shampoo dvd,this dvd is from england and will not work in any of my dvd players (this includes blueray)no where on the discriptiondid it say this. how stupid!!!
1,Misleading,Who ever thought to look at a region code? I bought this item under the impression that I would be able to view it on any DVD player. That's not the case. Apparently this DVD is coded region 2 which can not be viewed on a US DVD player. Very disappointing to say the least!!!!!
1,Shampoo,Total waste of money. This dvd will not play on my dvd player. It is meant to play on region 2 dvd players. Why sell a dvd in mthe U.S. that must be played on European dvd players? What a rip off.
2,This movie did not age well.,"When this film came out people praised it for capturing the ethos of the 70s. Looking at it now, the film is painfully slow and unengaging, and the production looks gritty and cheap. You may get a chuckle out of some of the costumes and the hair styles, but you could get those from other 70s era films as well, e.g. Nashville. Rent this one if you must, but don't waste your money on it."
5,Adult comedy classic!,"Netflix is truly wonderful because I haven't seen this movie in maybe 20 years and it is still the ultimate adult comedy. How can you go wrong with a Robert Towne script that is far more inside than anyone under 40 will ever know. What is truly great is at ""The Bistro"" the camera makes sure to pick up a portrait of Ronald Reagan...A good 10 years before he took office. Jack Warden has never been more hysterical when he spots his wife talking to his mistress and then proceeds to forget her name.This is Beatty's movie to be sure...and nothing can prepare you for what is quite possibly the ultimate wake up call to lost youth. It is a perfect gem."
3,"Wow, Totally Overrated!!","Okay, yeah, sure, there's some good scenes in this film and a few very funny bits and I think Lee Grant - who won an Oscar - is pretty good in this. I also found Jack Warden to be, as always, totally entertaining. But truly, this is not a great film by a longshot and Warren Beatty, who I like, seems for the most part sort of lame in this film. His character is so passive, even in the love scenes, it's hard to see how or why he was a sex symbol (in this film at least). Maybe it's a you had to be there 70s sort of film. But is it a satire? Is it a morality play of sorts played out in decadent 60s L.A.? Or is it a comedy? Honest to god, I don't know WHAT this film is in the end and I think the main reason for this is that IT doesn't know either. All I know is by the end, when [spoiler alert] Beatty doesn't get his way, it's hard to care much. For a great 70s film, I'd look to other classics like FIVE EASY PIECES."
3,Eh.,"The Amazon write-up kind of overdoes it. The movie may MEAN more than it actually IS, and that's not really a compliment. I didn't hate the movie, but it wasn't extremely interesting either. Funny, no. I don't know how it gets billed as a comedy. I can see the social commentary angle, but Beatty's main character is too annoying to be funny really."
1,junk,both the slide and the rocker look fun but are very poorly constructed and leak air. Very difficult to get return authorization through the internet. would not reccomend.
1,FUN FOR ONLY ONE DAY,"All the kids had a great time sliding down until the bottom tore away from the slide and it leaked. It tore at the corner and could not be repaired. Too bad, it was so much fun, everyone was so disappointed it could not be used by the end of the first day. I had thrown the box away once it was set up so I had to dry it off, stuff it in a trash bag and bring it to UPS for them to pack and ship which costs almost 40.00. The good news was Amazon refunded my entire purchase price including the 40.00 shipping and handling. . It would be a great product if they could reinforce the bottom."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun","My kids love their new Slide. My kids are having a blast on the slide, best inflatable toy I have purchased for our Pool."
2,Strong on fun weak on longevity,My two boys ages 8 and 11 and their friends had a blast the first four days on this slide. Unfortunately the bottom part of the slide which goes into the water is the culprit. It does not hold up well and will tear away from the body of the slide after repeated use thus the slide deflates. It is basically irreparable. Too bad - this was a good pool toy but not worth the hefty price tag. A redesign would make it better.
1,Deflated within a few hours,"I bought one of these slides 3 years ago & it was made w/ VERY THICK plastic. We got 2 long hot summers out of it before a thorn on a berrry bush popped it. So this summer I found the same slide online & bought it. Wow was I wrong. When I took it out of the box I was shocked at the THIN plastic, but blew it up anyway. 2 hours later after 2 64 lb. boys played on it it was half way deflated :-( What a poor product!!"
2,Cosmic Slide,"This slide lasted approx 1 month, My kids are rougher than most the bottom landing area ripped, and the entire slide was then useless. If your kids are on the smaller size, I could see it lasting a season."
2,"Fun to have, but it lasted one day","It's a lot of fun, but we returned after one day as there was a hole on one of the welding lines. Only kids used it, so I cannot say that it was stressed out a lot.They should just sell it cheaper with no warranty and you just know it is just like renting it. But if it doesn't leak air, then you are lucky to keep it for another ride.I retunerd it and got a full refund. Thanks Amazon."
1,Slide doesnt slide!!,Even with water flowing down this slide the kids find this slide almost impossible to slide down. It just DOESNT slide! Plus the bottom float part lays on top of the water surface and stops anyone from getting into the water. Kids hit that part and just sit! I guess the whole thing just doesnt work.
3,Get off the tangents,"Although I revel in any material on this subject, Marty lost me with his many side bars. I read the book to learn more about the race and the details of competitors accomplishments and agonies. I did not read the book to learn about Disneyland, the Concorde and sled racing. Also, although Marty claims to have coined the term, ""adventure racing"",if you look on the Eco Challenge web site, Mark Burnett claims it for himself. Having mountain biked with Marty just 2 months before Equador '98, I was not impressed. My book will be much better."
1,Great book for the adventure race spectator catching the bug,"The book took the reader through the emotions associated with adventure racing. It was an inside look at how it feels to desire to compete and complete an adventure race. The story does not get lost in overwhelming technical details of individual events, rather developing the whole experience of being driven with desire. I only wish the book would have been longer."
1,Marty need to actually finish a Raid before claiming so.,"While the book is at times an entertaining read, it is a work of fiction. Mr. Dugard has never completed a Raid or an Eco-Challenge in his life, though he has attempted many. All one has to do is speak with the numerous teammates he's left angry, frustrated and disgusted in his wake to learn the truth of Dugard's adventures. To imply that he actually completed a Raid is both a disservice to the readers and a slap in the face of adventure racers who have persevered enough to truly finish -- completing all sections of the course with their team. While Mr. Dugard might lay claim to being an adventurer, he is no adventure racer and in no way can he lay claim to that term -- Mr. Fusil is the founder and ultimate father of the term and the concept."
4,Surprise! CLASSIC Film Noir!,"100% fun film-noir rollercoaster in which Mickey Rooney plays an amoral mechanic who makes one horrible decision after another, getting himself stuck deeper and deeper in the quicksand of his predicament. The plot is hokey, but so satisfying...it includes a great femme-fatale and a swell part played by Peter Lorre. The photography is top-notch, and the San Francisco boardwalk (nighttime, natch)scenery is wonderful. Rooney is actually very good in this...he makes you root for him even though he acts like a jerk all the way through the picture. If you've ever dug yourself into a well of trouble, you'll really relate to this one! Enjoy!"
1,Buy the VHS - not the DVD,"Good story and acting. But the DVD of it - this black-&-white film was really washed out. It's watchable - but you will always notice the dullness of black and white contrast. A stupid way to manufacture it. I'd bet the VHS would be a much better picture quality. So, I ordered a VHS copy, which I haven't received yet. 4 stars for the movie story, acting, and enjoyed the old actors of those different times, not really all that long ago."
2,Mickey Rooneys acting very good as usual but plot weak.,"The story line was not up to the standards of a Mickey Rooney film of that era. The story starts off with Rooney oweing $100,00 for a watch and snowballs into a series of crimes that lead to 'murder'. If your not a Mickey Rooney fan save your money and time."
3,One thing leads to another.,"Danny (Mickey Rooney) borrows /steals $20 from his employer for a night out with a worldly woman he has just met; intending to return the money in a few days after he gets paid, before discovery; but things do not work out as planned. Danny is extorted by mean men and later by bad men into more serious crimes to stay out of jail; ever deeper into crimes.The appeal of the film is the believability of the situations Danny finds himself in. Filmed on location in Los Angeles. Peter Lorre is the bad-guy.This is not an Andy Hardy type film, but sort of a film-noir without the mystery. It is intriguing with good character-actors and realism. The film claims a happy-ending; has a good moral; but it is not a happy-ending. Thus, it is not a feel-good, film. I am a happy-ending guy; so only 3-stars.I watched it on Amazon's Video-on-demand."
3,Replacement tips,A search of the net for Waterpic replacement tips led to Amazon. Price was right and service was prompt.
3,Jet Tips,The product has not performed as well as my originals. The water pressure is noticeably lower.
1,Goodman's sent wrong item,"Well I really don't know how well the 4-pack of Teledyne piks (BRJ4) works because, even though it's clearly what I ordered, Goodman's, without notice, sent me the Official WaterPik 2-Pack (JT-70E) in its place for the same total cost to me as what I had paid for the Teledyne 4-pack.Two piks in place of four? For the same total cost? Of course I got cheated. But is it worth the hassle of returning the package (paying postage, etc.) and reordering? Obviously not. It's not worth writing this review either, except to spare others from dealing with this dishonest company."
1,"not the product shown, or even close","This order was a complete rip-off. I ordered the product shown and was sent a shoddily packaged and manufactured copy. No where on the package does it say Teledyne or Water Pik. I received a package with the letters Wp-Brj on the front, absolutely no manufacturing info anywhere on the package. The clear plastic cover looks like it was removed and pasted back on by a two year old. I have no intention of using this product. I will return it immediately and will inform Amazon of the poor service from this company."
3,It's a pity...,"It's a pity that the image for this product is not clear enough to make out what models for which these are compatible. Maybe then, they might acutally sell some. Even a decent product description would come in handy."
4,"Expensive, but you need them","What else can you do when you need to replace your tips? Well, order new ones, but be ready to pay more than you think to buy/ship them.Do they work? Yep, as promised."
2,**,"Talent shines in spots in this film, but overall the narrative thread goes in unbelievable directions. One surprise is seeing Dick York (who played Darrin in the TV series BEWITCHED!) give a wonderful dramatic performance. Yeah, Darrin from BEWITCHED gives a wonderful subtle performance in a serious part! I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it."
4,Who knew what pain a man could go through?,"Oh George, You ride a pony don't you. You like to ride ponies, but you don't like dirty girls in the big apple. As movies go, it's a movie in a movie and daughters are sad sad monkeys. Oh Yeah! Not since Pretty Baby has the world been so ha-cha-cha. George C. Scott is a sly fudgey."
2,"This books is about the BBC, Not CS Lewis","I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting to read about what Lewis said in those historic broadcasts. And why. But the book is filled with the ""how"". Not even the ""how"" from Lewis' point of view, but the ""how"" of the BBC staff. The story is well written and the book flows well. It just wasn't about a subject I found very interesting, or I should say, it wasn't about the subject I wanted to read about - What Lewis said in those war time broadcasts. Why he said what he said and What impact the broadcast had. A little of the ""how"" would have been interesting too."

3,"Smallest, Most-Portable, Rack-Mount UPS","Searched for a an ultra-light-weight UPS for a mobile rack system. This was the best I could find, and so far, I'm very happy with it. Powers a MacBook Pro, external monitor, and x3 external hard drives for ~20 minutes."
2,Can't handle a load,"I don't know why they make it seem like it can handle servers. All those outlets but if you use more that two it shuts down until you lower the load. If load is so critial, they should give you a clear reading of the load and not start out green only to turn rad and shut down."
3,A good movie... hopefully a better DVD,"I'm not going to delve into the story line as others have already done that. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. At 121 minutes long this movie seems that it was limited in how much of a story it could tell. The film makers are tasked with explaining brand new societies of vampires and wherewolves including new rules (which I don't mind... these are FANTASY characters afterall) and unfortunatley character developement did not get all of the screen time that it should have gotten. The visual feel of the movie was great, almost Gothamesque and the soundtrack matched the film perfectly. The Audio / Visual effects were very good too.I sincerly hope that a extended DVD will be released with 30 minutes more footage to explain the story a little better.Still, after seeing this movie last night I felt that my money was well spent. In its present form... this is a entertaining movie."
4,original and entertaining,"fairly tired subject matter gets a nice boost in this movie. Rather than go point to point over the movie, I have only to add that the plot is great and never drags, the settings and scenery look fantastic, and the best part: they did not over use wires and impossible body contortions in the special effects to make it entirely unbelievable.Great show and great special effects. Kate in BluRay? a must have!"
2,Close but no cigar! This movie bites...ina bad way!,"The concept was great and the initial visuals, although not new still set a nice tone. The vampires jump off a tower and land as if they just stood up off of a couch. Sharp teeth everywhere, glowing eyes, and guns a blazing...all else is downhill!The vampires show NO SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES other than the jumping and only the head lead vampire (not Kate Beckinsales character) show any strength or ability to do anything but shoot guns!It tries so hard to be The Matrix meets the occult but ends up being the bondage vampires with no powers against the really big hairy werewolves! At least those guys fought fair and had cool transformations! As was previusly mentioned ian another review the vampires even have reflections! I wouldn't be surprised if they even walked outside by day!Stay away from this one!"
1,Not so good,"I bought the movie thinking it was going to be a great action movie, YEP, it isn't. The wolfmen are ridiculous, it's always night in the movie, it's claustophobic. And the plot is involved. The script it's very weak and Kate Beckinsale doesn't look like a vampire, in fact, the vampires are the less resemblance to a vampire."
1,Underworld Is One Of The Worst EVER!!!,"I bought this movie last night, BIG MISTAKE, I had never seen it but i read the online reviews and it seemed to get good reviews so i decided to get it. I only gave this movie one star because i had too, It was some of the worst acting i have ever seen, The Werewolves looked stupid/retarted. Kate Beckinsale was the only good thing about this movie and not because of her acting. If you havent seen this bore dont waste the time or your money like i did.Overall I can sum this movie up in one word.....SUCKED!!!!"
1,Never Again,"Save your money, this one wasnt worth it. I wouldnt buy the DVD either.Len Wiseman scores Kate Beckinsale and that seems to be all he was after to begin with here.A waste of seven dollars and fifty cents."
1,Not so good horror movie.,It's not a good horror movie. The action is not exciting. The plot is so so. And so is the acting. There's no horror nor suspense here.
1,Buy Blade.,"This movie was completely stupid and crap. I have watched and owned it, but I got rid of it finally. The movie makes little to no sense and is just plainly boring and would drive death to suicide. It is mostly in it for the straight male society. Buy Blade. Seriously."
1,No spanish subtitles,This version does not come with spanish subtitles. It stinks. What happened with you Sony Pictures? Why did you include italian subtitles and not spanish subtitles?
3,I DIDN'T GET IT,"I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES AND I STILL DON'T GET THE MEANING OF IT. I MEAN, I LIKE TH SPECIAL EFFECTS AND EVERYTHING, BUT I DIDN'T GET THE PLOT AT ALL... I RECOMMEND THAT U WATCH IT FIRST AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT."
2,"Actually, 3 stars.","Though the story here is a fun new twist on an old tale (Romeo and Juliet), as a fan of the vampire movies and books i found the way they were portraied a bit offsetting. In addition, the movie seemed to have too many sub-plots that weren't developed enough or simply forgotten. Exciting overall, after Time the movie grows on you."
2,Why repackage a horrible film?,"This is just another plot to make money. I don't know why they would even bother to repackage such a horrible film. I fell asleep trying to watch this at least three times. It was a huge disappointment for me. The extras on the DVD aren't going to save this. It wasn't worth watching then and it still isn't worth watching now. Don't buy this, there are better films in this category that are actually worth watching."
1,Perfect example of a Bad movie making its way up the Boffice,"Extremely boring, i felt like leaving the hall half-way through. I really don't understand what people liked about this movie, i dont understand why it was such a success. The acting was horrible, average special effects and the storyline was obviously a rip-off from blade. The action scenes were badly executed, and look extremely fake.This movie basically tries very very hard to hide the fact that they copied nearly every aspect (including camera angles,costumes) from blade. And what's with the sound effects? The gun Kate Beck uses sounds like a toy gun.There is nothing good about this movie, the main reason IMO ppl thought this movie rocked was because there was nothing else to watch when it came out.So in conclusion, Bad movie with cool looking ppl in black to attract the juvenile crowd+ released at the right time = Success ."
1,Underworld,"Would not recommend buying from this company. I got the movie and it wouldn't play at all, and they have not responded to any of my e-mails to resolve the situation."
1,Please don't. It is AWFUL.,"While it is true that my awful may be your guilty pleasure, you will probably be saving yourself some time and loot by not buying this movie. The story doesn't hold up. You won't care about the characters and their struggles. Werewolves fighting vampires? Great concept! But like so many Hollywood concepts, the story just doesn't make it sing."
4,Very Entertaining,"Underworld was a suprisingly good movie. I was ready for a typical vampire movie, but it turned out to be a nice, modern twist to a very old genre. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel."
5,This movie rocks!,Underworld is magnificent! It is a battle between Lycans and Vampires.From the music to the dark set. This movie is awesome! You get pulled into the movie at the opening when you see Vampires watching the city and then they go in for the hunt because they see Lycans are in the city and following someone. It starts out with action as they start a whole scene fighting one another. It is not your typical love story it is more based on Vampires vs. Lycans but you get a sense of love with Kate and Scott. But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie. You will not be displeased with this movie it has a lot of cool special effects and the blood going into Viktor was neat. I love when they also walk into the house and the cool techno music was playing and the Vampires were just all sitting around while they crew walked through. It is a great movie with great heart. I read some reviews and not sure why so bad I usually hate movies like this but I love this one!
3,"Pretty good, but couldve been better","This movie was really pretty good, but there were a few things about it that I really didnt like. Pretty much, the vampires and the werewolves are having a war that has lasted for centuries. The werewolves have a plot to create a hybrid species between the vampires and werewolves, which will be stronger than both. Although the real plot is more complicated than that, thats it in a nutshell. I really thought the storyline was interesting all the way through, and the acting was pretty good. But the thing that really aggravates me about this movie, are the guns they use. This really had the potential to be a really great action movie, but when the action sequences come and the vampires and werewolves are just shooting eachother, that kind of defeats the purpose of making them vampires and werewolves, they might as well be humans. Overall, Id say this movie is worth a rental for 3.99, but nothing more."
3,A ripoff of The Matrix and Blade,"If you are into goth and if you liked The Matrix or the Blade movies you will probably like this movie. Others beware!!! Hollywood has clearly run out of ideas and this movie proves it. Hollywood just loves to beg, borrow and steal and that's what they do with this movie. How many sequels, ripoffs and remakes do we need Hollywood? Enough is enough. Come up with something original!!!!"
5,Great Movie,"I thought I would not like it, but in fact I loved it. I was very amazed and await a sequel."
4,Good Start,"I would certainly advise getting the extended unrated version of this film. It fills in a little more of the story and helps flesh out the story more. Filled with tons of extras at a reasonable price makes this worth the purchase. The movie itself is good and the special effects are top notch. It falls just a bit short of being a 5 star movie, but the disc itself is 5 stars."
3,"Interesting Ideas, poor execution","The whole concept of Licantropes vs. Vampires is very interesting. So is part of its mythology: the way old vampires are recycled, etc. The big problem with this atmospheric movie is in the guns and how the action scenes are shot.Why supernatural beings need guns?The thing is when they start shooting each other they are no different from your average Schwarzenegger movie: bad aiming, lots of shots, bigger guns, lots of mayhem. Everything made more confusing by the look-alike types of the characters (except the wonderful Beckingsale).At the end there are big holes in the plot (SPOILERS *** why wasn't Amelia strong enough to fight the werewolves to mention one).It felt good in the theater but later, looking back, it felt like the average summer actioner. With the only plus of a couple of good ideas."
4,Bashful's DVD Summary #017,"Best:1) It's stylish, dark and gothic to the hilt (for people who love that kind of thing).2) The creature effects makeup, CGI rendering and fight action was outstanding.3) There's a complex story to go with the visuals and things happen that you won't expect.4) There's plenty of special features including 4 documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.Worst:1) You may, like some, think that it's TOO similar to other high-budget films (like ""The Matrix"", ""Blade"" & ""The Crow"").Recommendation:If you really like vampire and werewolf movies, this film adds yet another twist to the old legends. If you liked the the slickness of ""The Matrix"" and the savageness of ""Blade II"" (the films I think it's most like), then I'm willing to bet you'll like this one too. Get it."
4,Good,"This title has 5.1 PCM apart from Dolby Digital 5.1.But I didnt find much difference between PCM and Dolby. Picture quality is good. It has single disc, unrated version."
3,Nice movie if you aren't too demanding,"I watched this movie last Sunday evening and found it entertaining. The plot (an ongoing war between vampires and their former slaves, werewolves)was promising, although perhaps more could be expected from it. Fine image, great soundtrack and the kind of gothic scenarios that I love. Acting was good, and Ms. Beckinsale looked gorgeous in her Matrix-bent vampire outfit. Action sequences were fine, except for the effect of the very last sword coup, which I found hilarious rather than impressing. Bottomline: It won`t make history, but is not boring at all, if you like this genre."
4,Underworld,Originally I was disinclined to see this movie. I thought it was going to be some cheesey vampire movie. I was channel surfing the other night and came across the movie on HBO and figured it wont hurt to watch it and if anything I'll fall asleep. I was up till 5am making sure i saw the end. The movie is very intersting and keeps you glued. The emotions and attitudes of the characters are believable. The computer graphics are obvious but they look good. The storyline is a bit up in the air. It seems that the writers just wanted to get some information out about vampires and werewolves and their histories together. Aside from that the movie played well and kept me awake when i expected to fall asleep. I bought this the same day (which is rare for me because i save every penny i find for my future house and car)
5,One of my favorite movies....,"Underworld is a beautifully crafted movie about Selene (a vampire) who tries to help a human that the Lycans (wherewolves) are after...all while trying to find out many unanswered questions....why do they want him...has one of their own betrayed them? She finds herself liking him and goes on to help him even though it's forbidden to do so. She soon learns that her human, Michael, is someone very special...This all happens while a war between vampires and wherewolves are going on. The uncut version includes a sexual scene that was cut out of the movie, just for your information. I highly reccomend it...look for Underworld: Evolution...coming to theaters soon as well!!!!"
4,Great!,"OK, it was a bit over goth. I wish all the vampires did not dress tlike they came from a White Wolf party at Dragoncon but of whell. The plot story was great, acting great. I liked it so much I got the two disc version. I hope they make a sequel."
4,Underrated by the critics,"This is a genre film that appeals to those of us who enjoy gothic fantasies -- of vampires and werewolves. Not so much derivative as developing the imagery of the genre. The story is about loyalty and betrayal, and the style is heavy action, very escapist. Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful and effective in this role. The visuals are dark but not tritely done -- well done. The plot moves fast, twists and surprises... Very good."
4,Underworld is Crazy,"If you think this looks cool, go see it. I'm not going to give this away, but the movie does get better as it unfolds. In fact, it's ... a political power play which keeps you guessing. The characters of Viktor by Bill Nighy and Erika by Sophia Myles are the better vampire performances in a decade. Viktor is a true badass and Erika is a cunning goddess. The story twists and turns; the ending was left open. Most of the actors and actresses are British, so it has a different flavor than say Blade or Queen of the Damned."
1,Vampires Vs. Werewolves - In a battle of Accents.,"In two words: moronic & pretentious. If I had to waste more words I'd say there was never a story here. The amount of time spent viewing this was excruciating - I stayed because of a friend. The plot isn't worth mentioning. The actors do nothing. My favorite scene was when some vampire jumps on top of a car and sticks a knife inbetween the driver and passenger side seats, like he thought someone might be there. This isn't Horror, this isn't smart, this isn't gothic, this doesn't deserve a sequel. I hated when 'Viktor' is revealed to be the badguy behind Selene's parents death, like it's a big revelation and we're all supposed to feel betrayed by this character or like anyone gave a damn."
4,Great vampire flick,"First of all I really enjoyed Underworld, and I think that the plot is a good. There's enough action to keep everyone interested but the movie involves more than just gruesome violence. There are twists in the plot and an interesting story line. Also, the performances by the actors/actresses are good. Another thing I enjoy about Underworld is that it's not disturbing or scary. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the Blade movies, the Crow and Frailty."
4,good,underworld was a pretty good movie. which has alot of action. and i was impressed with most of the scenes from this movie.
2,Should have been better...,"In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun. Think of it Vampires versus Werewolves. However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story. Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates. Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film. These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls?However, the movie is not a total train wreck. There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV. It just could've been better."
2,Pass.,"I was a bit disappointed with the original release: major plot holes, choppy action sequences, lousy soundtrack, total waste of the picture-perfect setting of Budapest, cramped character development and a hokey ending. Still considering the budget they had to work with, it was impressive enough as a first film.So I picked up the extended cut. Blah. It didn't fix any of the problems. There is nothing on the disc (for the film) that isn't included in the novelization (which was, sad to say, poorly written). If you've read it, you don't need to see the extended cut. If you haven't read it...the book is cheaper.This disc makes for a better rental than a personal purchase."
3,Eeeeh,"If I had been expecting this movie to be anything more than cool to look at... I would have been pissed.The movie started just as advertised: hot chick in shiney leather with a big gun, adequately bearable, if not vastly erotic.There are 4 kinds of movies. The first kind having a thorough and well thought out plot. The second consisting of bad cliches and painful dialogue. The third has no plot or any creative elements whatsoever. The 4th, however, is the rarest bird of them all. The 4th kind of movie actually manages to bring the plot backwards, so there is absolutely no hope in ever being entertained.This movie was a 3 1/2"
3,"It was entertaining, but not great.","A semi-stylish, only-okay action/monster movie with a muddled plot about werewolves-vs.-vampires and stuff. It's okay, though: the film moves fairly fast, and Kate Beckinsale looks great in all those tight leather/vinyl jumpsuits. It's no ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" but it was okay for a no-brainer rental. It was lame, though, that so much of the action was just people -- um, I mean, monsters -- standing around shooting a bunch of automatic rifles and pistols... We already see plenty of that in all the non-monster movies; didn't need it here so much."
4,Waiting for a sequel,I like monster movies. I watch alot of them. and underworld is a very good example of the genre.The Special effects were used very effectivly to support the plot not overwhem it. As I have seen the movie twice there are lots of little details that made the movie even more enjoyable the second time.PLEASE note this is an action movie not a romance. there is a very light undertone of attraction but rather than push it they stayed true to their characters and kept it low key. There maybe more love interest in the sequel. There is definatly enough depth to this world and enough loose threads to make it worthwhile.The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is I want to see the extras on the dvd. there is more to this story and I can't wait to see it.Bottom line- Go see the movie but don't expect epic romance expect a heroine who's world is about to turn upsidedown
3,Good horror/action movie,"This movie seems to be a cross between Batman and Blade. I didn't really know what to think at first but after having time to reflect and rewatch it, I really like it. It has a pretty good story and acting with great effects. The dark mood of the movie is also very nice."
4,Improvement over the original,"I really loved the original so when I heard there was an extended version I just had to get it. While some of the additions are insignificant, others are very significant. Over all, it adds to the exposition and creates a smoother flowing narrative and a clearer picture of this world. Some dumb movie executive probably ordered the cuts just because it was too long for those who have a short attention span. If not for the DVD format we might not have seen this as it was intended. I would probably give it 4 and a half stars if it were an option. But, I just cannot quite give it 5 because of Bill Nighy and Shane Brolly's C- performances. As for the second disc I never watch that stuff. I'm sure I'm not the only one though."
1,Skip this rip-off version,"If you're like me, you are really - really - getting tired of producers, film compaines, whomever there is to blame re-re-re-releasing the same DVD with different packaging, and calling it the ""Ultimate"" or ""Supreme"" or ""this time it really is a Limted edition"" special releases. The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more. You'd be better off spending your bucks elsewhere.There is NOTHING to make this DVD stand out from the original release. I was looking for extended fight scenes. Nope. OK, how about more history or plot? Nope. The extra footage really should have stayed on the cutting room floor. You WILL not be happy if you already own the original release and waste your money on this lame release."
4,Perfect Picture/Perfect Sound/Almost Perfect Movie,"This Review Is For Underworld In Its Blu-Ray Incarnation.I Have Just Finished Watching The Movie And All I Can Say And Think Is ""AMAZING""!!!The Picture And Sound Are Simply Incredible.This Is The Type Of Movie They Would And Should Use At An Electronics Store To Demonstrate The Advantage Blu-Ray Has In Both Its Picture And Sound Over Standard DVD.Not To Overlook The Incredible Story Line,Acting,And Computer Generated Graphics.This Was A Movie That Drew Me In From The Beginning And Never Let Me Go Until The End Credits Rolled.I Am Looking Forward,Now,To See The Sequel ""Underworld Evolution"".If You Get Only One Sci-Fi/Horror Movie On Blu-Ray Give This Movie Serious Consideration.It Will Most Certainly Be A Movie I Watch Many More Times Then Once.I Would Rate This Movie 4 and 3/4 Stars If That Was An Option."
5,Great Movie,"If you are into suspense, horror, sci-fi, action, fighting and/or vampire type movies, this is a great movie to add to your collection. After you get watch this, you will definitely want to purchase the second one too. I bought them both at the same time and think they are great movies."
1,NOT THE EXTENDED VERSION!!!!!!!!!!,"Only 2 hours long. My DVD is about 10 minutes longer. Why would I purchase a Bluray standard (unrated, not extended) cut."
2,Not what I expected.,"When I saw the cover of this in the video store, I thought to myself that this was going to be a great vampire movie. I was very wrong. This movie was a big disappointment to me. Half of the movie was no talking and shooting..boring action at that. The two stars are for Kate Beckinsale and the few gory parts of the movie that I enjoyed. The extras are even poor on this DVD. Nothing there except a few trailers and some other boring stuff. This movie was so boring that I fell asleep every time I tried watching it all the way through. I FINALLY managed after the fourth time of trying to watch it. I would not recommend this. A rental is about all it's good for."
4,it's alright,i didn't really care for this movie because i expected allot more action and even though it was cool i didn't like Kate Beckinsale in this movie and it isn't what i expected.
3,Could have been better,"Much has been written about the sparse acting and plot. The plot actually wasn't that bad (although a little Star-Trek like). I overall liked this movie except for Kraven, who just plain can't act. But once again, Kate is sooo cool and hot that she literally carries the movie on her back. Unfortunately her performance makes the other performances show as being hideous. Nice cinematography - sure it rips off the matrix. Also disappointing that it didn't show more vampire changes."
2,Defective DVD,The dvd has 2 spots were the playback stops even after cleaning the disc. I don't see an apparent defect on the disc.
5,Great Movie,Underworld is a great movie. I love their clothes and how the people turn into wolfs. Don't remember what they are called in the movie. This movie is so awesome. I can't wait to watch the second movie.
2,"Cool, sexy main character in a flat out bad movie","While this movie has an interesting/cool concept and a cool, sexy main character; its issues destroy it. Those issues are tons of bad writing, a poorly written plot and bad camerawork in the very few poorly action scenes that this movie has to offer. Overall, this film sucks ass, skip it. 1.5/10"
4,Must have!,Kate's performance is incredible. Good story and great special effects. Wish it lasted 10 hours.
4,very entertaining movie,"action packed, fast paced and all the elements of storey telling, certainly not a academy award winner,but good value for your buck !"
2,Let Down!!,I remember watching the previews for this movie and getting excited for a werewolf showdown with vampires. But unfortunately the previews showed the only good parts in the whole movie. I expected a action thriller but was bored to death when this dragged out movie just wouldnt end. Some action but few and far between. It was a let down.
2,UNDERWHELMING & BORING?,"How is it possible that a movie about vampires versus werewolves with a woman as hot as Kate Beckinsale in the mix can be dull? Somehow they managed to dull down the excitement that the trailer promised. If they had sexxed up the scenes between Scott Speedman and Beckinsale they might have saved this movie, but all the special effects and shooting wasn't enough.Hard to believe this movie was as dull as it was. Rent or buy something else."
2,"Had much to promise, but didn't deliver","Seeing the trailer many times before the movie came out, it looked like one of the strongest movies in atmosphere in past couple of years. When seeing the movie, I was disappointed to such a high extent. Very limited in action, and attempted to be philisophically strong but just proved it redundant. This movie was easily the biggest disappointment in 2003. If you didn't see it, I highly advise it stay that way and watch something like Freddy vs. Jason or 28 Days Later (better horror movies in 2003)."
2,Wow... Just wow.,"Imagine a movie with tired ideas, ridden with cliches from the insiddious goth ledgends of vampires and the like. Now add on some terrible acting, and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. I mean, the werewolf's transforming would have looked better if it was stop motion for gods sake. So, you have imagined it? Good, now don't see it. I might have set your expectaions too highly with this review, for as bad as I have made it sound, it is actually far worse. Not House of the Dead bad, mind you, but pretty terrible all the same."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I had high expectations for this movie, I mean come on, the eternal war between werewolves and vampires with a hot chick starring in it. However I found the movie to be unoriginal, poorly constucted and written, with some of the worst special effects this side of 1990. The filmmakers were too ambitious in my opinion, if they had worked with about $20 million more in the budget it might have been worth seeing. The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, which was very cool, including some very nice use of filters creating a dark but polished look---think matrix. Otherwise the use of stop-motion was ugly and uninspired, and I found the dialogue to, rather than generate compassion or hatred for the characters, leave me unsimpathetic and uninterested. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE."
1,hhhmmm didnt you say this was a vampire movie?,I would like to say that I like this movie but I hate it. When I paid to see this movie I thought it would be Dracula in the year 2000 or something but I was blown away at how different it turned out to be. it appears that you no longer need a stake to kill a vampire or the fact that they can see themselves in mirrors (bedroom looking at laptop scene). Dont they hide in the shadows trying to seduce women for bloodsucking anymore?But on the other hand this movie did have some good wholesome action in it that I can enjoy the special effects are pretty cool to. if you like action and a forrbiden love story in between this is the movie for you.But overall if you are the hardcore old style vampire fan (like myself) then this flick is deadweight to your movie collection
2,unbelievely stupid,"This movie, while it had some promise, failed miserably to deliver. The story of vampires fighting werewolves was resonable enough, even though werewolves do seem to have the advantage of daylight. This is the first movie that I have seen that have made werewolves thinking creatures. In vampire mythology, they have no reflection, do not cast a shadow, have superior hearing and sight and incredible strength. Not in this version.It turned out to be a love story. Part one of a love story."
3,Nice try but not really new or exciting,"As a main stream, vampire/werewolf movie this was nice.If they were trying to break some new ground here - sorry, they just didn't deliver.The idea that werewolves and vampires both came from a common human ancester was a new idea but didn't really go anywhere.They did lay some nice ground work for a second - and very likely superior - movie.Worth watching once but not one I'd spend money on to own."
1,"Um, pardon me, but was this supposed to have a plot?","Well, sorry, chaps, but it didn't. A huge dissapointment from a very promising concept."
1,UNDERWHELMED,"If I can think of one movie that I HATE, it is ""Underworld"". I was so excited to see the battle of the vampires & werewolves, and laughed through this whole movie. I HATED HATED HATED this movie. The costumes were apparently borrowed from the Warner Bros vault when ""The Matrix"" was through with them. I didn't know vampires suddenly have reflections in mirrors (one female is looking in a mirror deciding which dress to wear and has a reflection!). Who is paying for the online account and cellphones that the vamps use???? Do they send the bill to the LAIR BELOW THE STREETS!!!????? What's up with that???? Dark, dreary, depressing, horrible acting, horrible script, clothes from a better movie, sets from ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"". Skip it. Send it back to the Underworld and get it out of ours."
3,If only this could be a SuperBit format of 134 mins run time,Why can't ALL Extended or Director's Cut version format be available in SuperBit format?Why not release a 134 minutes for a SuperBit instead of having Theatrical Release Run Time of 121 minutes for this Underworld?I truly love SuperBit format with DTS.
5,Underworld- The Review,Underworld is an awesome movie. It is not very gory aand they dont say many cuss words. It is a good movie.
4,"Not a bad film, despite any bad review's you may read.","The idea behind a secret war between Vampires and Werewolves is something new at least, but throw away any ideas you may have about a battle of teeth and claws. Most of the fighting is done with high-tech weaponry. In fact the only actual act commited by any of the Vampires, that resembles what you would think a Vampire would do, occurs late in the movie. The Werewolves (Lycans) do tend to show their tendancies more. They ""make the change"" quite more often.But this film goes past a mere sci-fi gory bloodbath. Although it doesn't really seem like one exists early, there is a plot. And it's not a bad one, but the film does tend to get pretty predictable. That would have to be it's main downfall.If you can put aside the predictability and the lack of Vampires being traditional Vampires, then this film will go over quite well with you."
3,Good popcorn flick.,"OK, this movie didn't win any Oscar awards, which really suprised me until I remembered that Oscars are given to movies that (1) I dislike and (2) have some sort of ""artistic"" message. Well, Underworld failed on both counts. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief to an almost unreasonable level (if the vampires are so powerful, how come the werewolves beat them like a rented mule in every fight?) and put up with some really poorly acted scenes (ie: every one that has a confrontation between Beckinsdale and the #2 vampire chick), but in the end, it's a fun movie to watch. Don't worry if you don't love it, because you'll forget about it totally within half an hour.Unless you're in love with K.B., don't buy this. Just go rent it the next time you've got 2 hours to kill."
3,Take the matrix and throw in some vampires and werewolves!,"Tight leather outfits, gothic look, lots of automatic weapons and just enough vampire lore to make it all fit. Good stuff. Not overly gory. Really quite tame. The werewolves are a bit scary. Not for the young."
3,Very entertaining movie good for a rainy day,"I liked this movie very much, being a fan of vampire movies and books, I got this movie as a present and really enjoyed the visuals, action and the goth-like presentation.And using the film to explore race and social issues in a vampire/werewolf context was very interesting, good movie for a rainy day."
3,UNDERWORLD,"I thought this would be another cheap Blade/Matrix rip off.It actually stands on it's merit, with another concept.This is no Blade admitidly and Kate Beckinsale is certanily no Wesley Snipes! But let's face it she gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money on the looks department. Besides that she is confident in the action department, with the token twin handguns on display. I like the plot of werewolfs feuding with vampires,the twist is good for what it's worth.It's nice to see Bill Nighy as a super villian, escaping type from ghastly Brit comedies like Love Actually.At the end of the day order a Pizza and drink a couple of Budweisers and enjoy the show!"
3,"Underworld, Underachiever","This movie has a great premise. vampires versus werewolves in an all out war for supremacy. fighting fang and claw... Oh wait they're not, they're using guns and wearing long black coats. sound familiar?The main problem with this movie is that director Len Wiseman has stupidly decided to forget about all the old mystical roots of werewolves and vampires in favour of copying popular action movies like Blade and The Matrix. The performances are adequate enough and the action is watchable, though not very original. the art direction is good and Kate Beckinsale in a catsuit is always worth a look, but it could have been so much better. if you want a more original horror action movie check out Brotherhood of the Wolf or Blade."
3,Striking but Confusing,"At least this movie looks great--although at times it's so darkly lit I couldn't see what was happening. It moves fast and sometimes it's hard to follow but for about 2 hours, it's worth the look. One curious note: although Kate Beckkinsale is a vampire, you'd never know it. She's just like some edgy, model-looking dame who occasionally jumps off a l5th floor balcony. I wanted more monster transformations, a la Howling. She's surly, moody and doesn't have much charisma. The hero is a real babe!"
4,Cool vampire vs werewolf movie,"It was nice to see the beginning of the Underworld series. I saw this after watching Rise of The Lycans, and the movie made a lot more sense after seeing the first Underworld. The video quality is ok, but it's standard definition which is to be expected. I watched it on my tv through my xbox; there weren't any visual problems. The visuals in the movie were pretty good for a nearly 10 year old movie, good sound too. I really have to check out the new Underworld, but I think I may have to wait until it comes out on Blu-ray."
4,Underworld,"I purchased this because it was my brother's favorite movie and we didn't have it on DVD. It's a good movie, though a little cheesy in some spots for me. I honestly prefer the second movie to this one."
5,Selene Is Hot!,"I love everything about this movie, especially Kate as the hottest death dealer in the universe. I can watch this over and over. Great story, fantastic special effects and awesome action scenes."
3,Extended cut NOT Director's cut,"I'm a big fan of this movie, and the extras that come with this version are nice, but I wish I had of chosen the theatrical release. The extra footage that you'll find in this version is quite good, and does a better job of explaining some of the plot points and character motivations, and I did enjoy having the director and both main characters doing the commentary BUT the footage that was cut was cut for pacing reasons and as a result this version tends to drag on. If there's ever a director's cut I'll consider buying that, but, given the choice, I'd rather the good pacing and tempo of the theatrical release than the extra story points."
5,Ummm,"First off this was a good film. Second, it wasn't scary; and it definitely could have been better. A Vampire verses Werewolf film should be action intensive; and although it did have action none of it was ever in slow motion. (So the watcher never got those cool ""matrix"" shots.) And most of the action just felt like those old westerns. Draw a gun bang, bang, bang. ""Oh, one guy went down and the other's running."" ""He got shot in the back."" ""Okay the good guys win."" Not really what should be created in our modern world; but! If you can get over that it had a vary good story line, and some cool morphs between humanoid and wolfish. Plot was a Five Star. Acting Five Star. Photography, Five Star. Action, about two."
3,Malas especificaciones del producto,"yo compre este DVD porque claramente especifica subtitulos en Ingles, Español y Frances, pero al recibir el producto, me doy cuenta de que !NO! tiene subtitulos en Español. La pelicula es exelente, pero lastima que no incluya el sustitulo en español como ahi lo especifica"
1,"Based on the movie, not the DVD","I saw this movie at the theater and was pretty disappointed. It looked interesting, lots of action, maybe some romance. Instead, it was a gorgeously shot boring movie. My husband, a former comic book geek, absolutely hated it and almost fell asleep during the predictable, often nonsensical story. Also, some of the myths about vampires are blatantly disregarded without explanation, like why these vampires can see their reflections in mirrors. The costumes, set, and cinematography were great, but I would never buy this movie, or even tape it off cable TV."
1,This is a RIPOFF!,"This is a fun action movie - this review is not of the movie itself, but the ""unrated"" DVD version. There is nothing in this film that would change the rating anyway - it's just schlocky marketing of the worst sort.The extras are a joke, but the commentary is pretty decent. The extra film footage is just some gratuitous sexual footage (and precious little of that) about a sub plot we already knew existed in the theatrical version of the film! The ending of the extended cut of the film also allows for a sequel, something that just ISN'T going to happen. I think they knew that, which is why they made the ending of the theatrical release different.THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THE FILM THAT WARRANTED A SPECIAL RELEASE!Again, I liked the film, but this product is a complete ripoff at the price they're charging.Buy the much less expensive theatrical release.[...]"
3,Hot Kate Beckinsdale average movie sorry blade is best vampire series.,"Hello i just watched this for first time after seeing Awakening which was just above average movie is pretty good and enough horror action violence to keep you entertained throughout but i wasnt over scared watching it or wanting more after watching it sorry also action scenes were just ok nothing special, overall movie is watchable but probally not view again for awhile after watching this series, i prefer Resident Evil or Blade a bit more."
2,Good but..,It was a pretty good movie but even for having prime it cost far too much to rent :( Maybe we could consider prime members getting an even better discount?
3,Not enough action,"Movie was definitely not what it was built up to be. I thought is was a decent movie worth watching, but there was not near enough action scenes. I think there are like 3 through the whole movie and only 1 of them is of any length. The action scenes and the special effects were good when they actual happened but the movie left alot to be desired. The ending leaves the story ready for a sequel, lets just hope if it is made they action put some action scenes in."
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!","This was an EXCELLENT MOVIE. I can't wait for the sequal!!!Believe me when you see those vampires fight you just have to ask yourself ""Can Buffy the Vampire Slayer beat THOSE kind of vampires?"". My answer is no...no...NOOO!!! Man if Buffy had to fight those vampires from this movie, she would be dead in a minute. Man they will take little Buffy and turn that woman out until she is dead.Well...that is beside the point. However, this is a GREAT MOVIE WITH A GREAT STORYLINE ENOUGH SAID."
2,cliche-flavored eye candy,"it's moments of lucidity can get pretty good, but this movie suffers from trying to weave too complex a plot. In addition, it frequently makes no sense and frequently looks like a game being played in ""god"" mode as characters never run of ammo, go to bullet-time, and actually use the drawn-out villain explanations to, ohmygosh, well, I geuss I won't spoil it for you. Suffice to say, none of these villains could take out Captain Obvious. No one acts like this unless they are reading a script. No one. Maybe pro wrestlers. . . .Nothing in this struck me as new or fresh, just rehashed death scenes and ridiculously present mood music. Goth to be goth, for nothing else.Is it just me, or does it look like they ran out of money for the final fight scene?Check out Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere (book beats film) for a much deeper story, characters, and your own choice of mood music."
4,"Very good, but it will require a brain to follow.","If you could not follow the movie, give up. I am very tired of hearing about people that cannot follow the Matrix or any sci-fi movie that requires some kind of intellect to follow. Maybe we can have theaters pause movies every ten minutes so the room can get together and discuss what is happening before it is too far into the movie for some to follow. Amazing.This movie was well done. I must admit I had read harsh reviews and wasn't expecting much. It's full of eyecandy and if you like the idea of a dark and different story then go for it. I'm not a die hard vampire / werewolf fan so it may not be as accurate as expected, but overall the movie was quite fun."
3,"Not Bad, but not great",This movie had so much potential but I feel that it never came through. I love the idea and the atmosphere it provides is excellent. I can't honestly put my finger on it but this movie is missing something. It's hard to find a really good horror/sci-fi movie these days. I thought this one might be it but the story and the action just don't cut it. Would I watch it again? Of course I would! I just hope that the extended edition has something more to offer.
4,Best vampire movie i seen in a while,This was one of the best vampire movies i have see in a while. Other than the fact that Kate Beckinsale looks really good in this it was a well put together film. It has great special effects and alot of action. You wont get bored watching this. It has the dark and gloomy atmosphere that a movie should have. There was no unnecsary love scenes that made it boring and drug out. It is not a film of vampire seduction and sex. Great movie for vampire fans.
4,Fast service,This movie came to mme in perfect condition and arrived 2 days early..awesome service /definately would buy again...
4,GREAT NEW LOOK FOR KATE,"I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.I HAVE SEEN KATE BECKINSALE IN HER USUAL ROLES (PEARL HARBOR/SERINDIPITY) AND WAS A LTTLE SCEPTACLE HOWEVER, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE IT WAS HARD NOT TO COMPARE THIS TO THE MATRIX CROSSED WITH INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE BUT SOMEHOW THIS WORKS AND MAKES GREAT VIEWING..THROW IN SOME GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS..THINK AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (NOT THE TRASHY REMAKE IN PARIS VERSION) AND THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE FEEL OF THE MOVIE.FOR THOSE THAT LOVE A BIT OF ACTION WITH A TOUCH OF ROMANCEYOU WILL BE SURE TO RATE THIS MOVIE HIGH..I LIKED IT A LOT MORE THAN MATRIX REVOLUTION AND MATRIX RELOADED ,LETS SAY ON EQUAL STANDARD OF THE ORIGINAL MATRIX..CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF THEY MESS UP THE SEQUAL TO THIS AND IM SURE THERE WILL BE ONE.ENJOY I DID"
2,dull and boring,"besides of the good special effects of the werewolves aka lycans, this movie was very dull and boring. some good fight scenes. very slow and is a great movie for getting your parents to fall asleep so you can sneak out of the house"
1,Puh-lease......,"I waited in anticipation for this film, only to be let down.You've read the reviews. Here's why I don't like it-Bad acting...No good storyline....Too predictable.This is your basic predictable, starring FX only movie. You want to watch a good, fun vampyre movie? Go watch ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" or ""John Carpenter's Vampires""."
3,An average movie,The movie could have been very good if the character and story line would have been further developed. You always felt that you were droped in the middle of a story. If more of the questions would have been answered than it would have been a very great movie.
5,Absolutely Mind Blowing!!!,"This movie is first off, one of the best vampire movies I have watched recently. This is leaving out the point which the plot is about vampires hunting down the remainder of the Lycans(werewolves). Kate Beckinsale is an absolutly amazing actress. This was the first movie which I have seen that she was in. Her part in this movie is as a Death Dealer is an extremely serious role. I do not believe she smiles even once. That takes a great skill. Back to the movie. It is about a vampire who falls in love with a human. This human, Michael, is bitten by a werewolf and begins to see flashbacks of memories of the strongest Lycan. This werewolf's name was Lucian. As Selene(Kate Beckinsale) tries to help Michael....Just buy the movie already. No dissappointment guaranteed.(For a good laugh, look at Lucian's face when Michael has his flashback at the Lycan's dwelling!)"
2,Ugh,"This is one of those movies that could have been great. I mean really, really, really, cult movie to the max. great... Only they missed.The story line is wonderful, but for the first thirty min. you are left wondering what is going on. You have no idea past history until over half way through the movie. I have seen this tactic done before in other flicks, and this one just didnt get it right. I was left wondering for far to long who was who and what was what.Although the concepts between the two waring factions in the film were wonderfully contrived, the fight scenes - scenes important to all battle movies, were horrible! I kid you not, my husband and I could do better play acting than this when drunk.So what do I recommend? See it if you are bored. If for no other reason than the laughs at the ""sliced head"" scene."
2,Boreing and Not very scary,"I thought this would be as good as the Blade movies, but it definitly is NOT. The acting made me sleepy and it was not scary at all.THIS IS A BRITISH MOVIE. So if you didn't like the Tomb Radier movies, then you sure won't like Underworld."
3,Underworld,"I saw this movie a while back, and while it isn't the best movie ever, I do love the mood and theme. Vampires vs. Werewolves. And it's made much better in beautiful High-def. This movie will never win any awards for acting or plotline, but for a modern day take on the classic ""horror"" creatures it is entertaining. I got it off Amazon for about $14.99 and it was well worth the purchase, but I probably wouldn't pay more than 20."
3,Vampire vs. Werewolf,"Not bad, not great, but not bad. If you ever read the World of Darkness series from White Wolf Press it will be easier for you to get into the story and grim backdrop. It was a good story and pretty good cast. But I feel they could have gone in another direction using the original story idea. They just went with the same old, boring, 'girl falls for guy' theme."
3,Lycan not Lycon,"First, id like to say that this movie is interesting, but they could have done better with the sfx.Second, the werewolves are called lycans for a good reason-a lycanthrope is a person inflicted with lycanthropy-lycanthropy is the ability to assume characteristics of a wolf or the delusion that one has become a wolf-lycan = werewolflukos = wolfanthropos = manthere, now people cannot complain about calling werewolves 'lycans'"
2,Beckinsale in latex rules - flick sucks,Kate Beckinsale looks smoking in this movie in her latex outfit but there is no other reason to watch the flick.
4,Better then people think!!!,I caught it when it was out in theatres last summer and really liked it.I picked up the DVD the other day and I think it was even better this time then when I first saw it.The only thing I wish was better was the hybrid.The end result wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.But I was happy with the overall movie.
2,Underwhelmed,"Okay, the premise was interesting, Vampires versus Werewolves (Lycans). But who wants to see them duke it out with GUNS??? Adding to the stupidity, the Vampires shoot silver nitrate bullets, and the Lycans shoot (I'm not joking here, folks) daylight bullets! The acting is rather hammy. The dialogue is such a waste, many times it really seems as though it is simply there to fill time. I will admit that the movie got better as it went on, and in the end, I would call it midly entertaining. Really, though, nothing more than a hybrid of The Matrix and The Crow movies. Unless you are a serious comic book geek or insatiable g*th cow, skip it."
4,"Duh, there's going to be a sequel.","This was just a hint of things (possibly) to come. Actually, lots of little hints. So quit whining about there not being enough detail or enough of a love story."
4,very good nevertheless,Not a 5 stars as this cannot match the level of matrix and mostly Van Helsing which is an absolute reference in this catégory.This movie can hold a good place in yr dvd collectionenjoy it.
5,AWESOME!,This movie is awesome! I am definately going to see the sequel in theaters. Kate Beckinsale was great. So was Scott Speedman. This is like another Van Helsing movie. Only with not that extended in action content. The only flaw in my opinion is that the werewolves weren't that real looking.
5,had to buy it again,I love this DVD. I had the original release but had to buy the unrated version. Totally worth it just for the comic book and sketch booklet alone.
3,DAMN! KATE BECKINSALE IS SO HOT!!,"I guess that was my first notion when I saw this movie. Kate Beckinsale: she's hot. (In an English sort of way.) Once I got past all Beckinsale dressed up in a tight-fitting PVC catsuit (Every man's dream!) I realized that this was a pretty well-developed movie. In terms of its story, it's been done before; but I am a sucker for the Westside Story/vampire werewolf love angle. As the movie moved along, I became impressed by its level of creativity and invention. And it's a beautifully styled film as well. In the extended cut, we are treated to lots of extras, included a very entertaining audio commentary by the director, Beckinsale, and Scott Spedman. In addition, the documentaries that are included in this set offer loads of information on the entire process of creating this entertaining movie."
4,Enjoyed this movie in Blu-ray,"I enjoyed this movie. The way the story was written is good. The picture quality is top notch, really deep blacks and well colored blue/gray hues. The sound was OK, not the best (the gun shots could have been louder). And of course Kate B. kicks werewolf/vampire butt in this movie."
4,"Bueno, pero esperaba mas del producto","Anteriormente rente el DVD y la pelicula abarcaba completamente la pantalla, es por eso que solicite este DVD (por el widescreen), aunque independiente de eso hubiera esperado mas extras en esta edicion.La historia era algo que se venia esperando, vampiros, hombres lobos, sociedades secretas y obscuridad. Muy buenos efectos en la transformacion de los hombres lobos, aunque nunca entendere como es que en la europa oriental, todos pueden hablar el ingles con una fluidez que asombra."
1,movie is horrible,"One of the worst movies ever, its better when u watch it in spanish cause then u at least dont have to hear the stupid dialoge. Only good part is Kate Beckinsale man shes hot."
3,A STUDY IN APATHY,"UNDERWORLD is visually impressive, with its dark, dark underworld and the lack of real ""color"" in the film. Blues, greys, blacks, and of course a little blood red(even it is dark) combine to create an atmospheric world of evil. Lots of flashy special effects and imaginative camerawork. The cast does some good work: Kate Beckinsale, Shawn Brolly, Bill Nighy, and Michael Sheen in particular; Scott Speedman walks through his role as a zombie, which is not part of the horror menu here. So what's wrong? The movie has no real likeable characters, as if one should like a vampire or werewolf, and there is such disregard for human or other life that it left me feeling vacant and unaffected. Nice to look at, but empty calories."
2,Spongecake.,"Did you know there has been a war going on for hundreds of years? And it all started because the upper class and lower class dared to fall in love and have an abomination for a baby? Master vs. Servant! Father vs. Daughter! Oh, the drama! How can they fit all this into one movie! Easy, Underworld leaves out any sense of character development and relies on convoluted and cliched story lines. But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?). It's like eating Twinkie. Oh sure, it was fun to eat, but once it's gone you wonder why you ever indulged."
1,"Laughable,wannabe vampire flick....","I was forced to go see this movie when it was first released and I laughed through the whole thing. The acting is terrible and I could,in no way, feel any sympathy for any of the characters. The screenplay is awful and there are huge gaps in the story that are never resolved.Go see a Hammer Studios vampire flick, such as Taste The Blood Of Dracula. You'll thank me."
4,"a review that doesn't give away movie, .........be surprised","Unlike most/some I had an idea of the story but never bothered to listen to the details. Given that I believe, as I do with many movies, that it is best not know too much about the story so as not to build up any expectations. Even with that I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't too much of a love story (thankfully!) and the plot had a few little surprises (but don't look for any big twists). There was just a slight shift in my perception towards the end, which was one of the nice little surprises. I like horror/vampire movies, strong female characters and I won't usually admit this, but I'm beginning to believe that I am a closet goth. I got really excited when I learned that there's a book (I'm sure better detail) but not that it was a movie first, oh well."
2,Underworld,Okay I bought the DVD and watched the film. The effects were great but the story needs some help. This movie is like Gangland's of New York but add Vampires and Werewolf's to the mix and presto! Let the biting and howling begin. Also the movie does not really end it sets itself up for a sequel (let's hope the plot is better) If you enjoyed the Matrix or Blade then this movie is for you!
5,This movie is great!!!,I saw this movie a few days after it came out in theaters and I loved it! I don't understand why people are so hostile about the movie. The only thing that was like the Matrix was all of the slow moving stuff (Which is in almost every movie nowadays). Underworld was so much better than any of the Blade movies and Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Selene. This was definately one of the best movies of the year!
3,Not bad,"This movie wasn't as bad as i expected. It actually had some sort of plot with a sequel in mind but isn't that what Hollywood is all about these days? After watching this movie, i'm looking forward to seeing underworld: evolution."
4,A film with a story instead of flashy effects,"This film was way better than I had expected. OK, the special effects are not all that great. On the other hand, the story and the acting are more than adequate, and that means more to me. I suppose one of the problems with the film is that the borders between good/bad are extremely blurred. As in most wars, good and evil depend on whose side you are on. This film is way too complex for an ordinary horror/action flick.The film might not succeed one hundred percent in its goal, but it is close enough, and does not fall flat as too many other films do. It is exciting all the way through."
4,Good and entertaining,"The movie was good, generally speaking. The pacing was acceptable and it had everything on it, action, romance, a good plot and all. But almost at the end of the movie something happens that it doesn't make sense at all and it made me loose interest in it. Still I highly recommend the movie if you are looking for a variety of events."
4,Quite well executed film,"Underworld is an extremely under rated film. The vampire and lycan (werewolf) cultures are depicted quite accuratley, Kate Beckinsale is amazing!Its also very refreshing to hear Maynard's (lead singer from A Perfect Circle/Tool) voice in a film again (last time was in Escape From LA, to the tool tune ""Sweat)Very good story, action, and a love storyGreat movie"
4,Underworld Extended Cut- Acceptable,"Anything that makes a movie more exciting, and more detailed, is allright with me. Deleted scenes are one thing but to intigrate them into the movie is pretty much ok. I actually thought the scenes were gonna be stupid bloopers. They weren't. Without giving up too much, here are some details.Michael tells Selene about his life in the interegation building.Kraven and Erika get intimate and conspicuous.There's a whole new story about why the Lycans want Michaels blood.It's not everything but in the end, it all boils down to what you see. I recommend trying to find this at a rental place before buying it off Amazon."
4,I completed expected less,"I thorougly enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to. I went in knowing nothing... I feel as though everybody else seemed to know it was a vampire vs. warewolf movie beforehand. Anyway, perhaps that's why it was a surprising treat to me. I thought it was well done and far more enjoyable than the trailers or the poster makes one think. The poster reminds me too much of that Purple Rain guy!"
3,Soundtrack missing?,I may be mistaken but this version seems to be lacking the music that I remember from the theatrical version. The credits list about six songs. But I don't here anything but a little back round sound. Is this just my DVD? Some kind of manufacturing problem? I'm confused. Great movie though.
5,Excellent blu-ray disk,"One of my favorite recent movies. An excellent blu-ray transfer, and good test of contrast and black level. Some blu-rays are inferior to the best DVDs, but this is one that is very sharp, three dimensional, and demo quality."
5,Can't wait for the third in the trilogy!,"I love this series! I read a lot of vampire books, but finding a good vampire movie was extremely hard. I've watched maybe two dozen and they all sucked. This one and the sequel were exactly what I've been looking for--fast, weirdly believable, dark, and with a touch of romance. highly recommended."
3,I would rate this higher but...,"I really, really liked the theatrical release of Underworld, so when I finally got a Blu Ray player I picked it up on blu ray pretty quickly. While the visual and audio is fantastic, I wish they had not added in the extra footage. None of it was relevant or really entertaining--I don't need to see Kraven and that blond floozy making out for 6 minutes at a stretch (I'm not a prude, but jeez, it was BORING--no T&A;, no character development or plot advancment...what the heck?). The rest of the extra footage was pretty much the same--pointless and boring. There were bits and pieces of scattered throughout, but it really all belonged on the cutting room floor. It made the movie less enjoyable for me.The picture quality was great, the audio quality was great...but I just want the theatrical release, not the extended. There's a reason stuff gets edited!"
5,Superb Blu-ray Hi-def release,"The film is stylish and highly entertaining. Kate Beckinsale gave a stellar performance in this movie.Besides many included extra, this Blu-ray release features superb AVC video encoding and outstanding uncompressed PCM 5.1 soundtrack.You'll enjoy this must buy Blu-ray release."
4,from an extra's point of view,"Having the fortune of participating in the first day of filming as an extra, I eagerly anticipated Underworld's release. This vampire vs. werewolf film was shot almost entirely in Budapest, Hungary. I believe they chose Budapest for its old city feel and for the numerous underground locations. As with many other fans of this genre, I was excited by the prospect of the vampire vs. werewolf storyline. While I thought the plot was pretty good, I felt that it was a little too complicated and difficult to follow at times. However in the end the pieces came together quite nicely. The acting was pretty good as were the special effects. It was interesting to see Kate Beckinsale as an action hero...She did quite well!"
4,Rented Underworld,"Enjoy the vampire genre, this one has a more detailed and imaginative back story for the characters, I found it very intriguing."
5,Enjoyed all of them,"Good Vampire vs. Lycon flick, I enjoyed them all pretty much. Story is okay action is great and drama and suspense is in there a bit as well. No name actors did well also at least none of them I really recognize from anything else."
1,don't buy into the studio BS,"I liked the movie, but it really ticks me off that they release the DVD and then a month or two later they release an ""uncut version"" Don't support this kind of actions for the greedy studios. Buy the original version. Let this ""uncut"" version fall dead on its face and show that consumers won't take this from these greedy studios any longer. (The only exception being the Lord of the Rings extended versions) Vote that you find this review helpful if you agree."
3,"So close, and then the guns.","I could have loved this movie. It looked great, had interesting characters and used a decent rehash of the old vampire vs werewolf story. But why oh why have all these exotic beings with supernatural abilities, and then bring it all back down to a hokey shoot-out by introducing the idea of both sides having guns that can kill the other. One of the great things about vampire or werewolf movies is that they are so hard to kill, allowing for great hand-to-hand type action scenes. To beat the biggest bad, you should have to be Really Good. But allow either side to be taken out by a bullet from afar, and what do you have? It might as well be gangster flick or WW2 yarn."
3,Kate Beckinsale alone is worth the whole movie!!!,"Man, this woman is simply gorgeous!!! And gorgeous in a natural, simple way, and not a silicon-Botox-fake blond way. But that would be useless if she could not act. But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called ""Pearl Harbor""). She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of ""fuel"" (Carrie Ann-Moss should have learned from her when she played ""TRINITY"" in both sequences of MATRIX...)And, sometimes, I just don't understand critics. This movie received a lot of backlash. Sue, it's far away from perfect, but critics are always complaining of brainless action flicks, with no substance (Bruckheimer-kind of movies)... UNERWORLD is nothing liek that. It constructs its history slowly and carefully, until reaching its climax."
2,the noise deafened their brains...,"i'll agree that the action and the lighting and the costumes were all very impressive for the first twenty minutes of this ""Matrix shoot 'em up rip."" Once the actors started talking plot and motivation, however, the entire picture fell apart. The ""Awakening""?--is this a leftover Buffy episode?Kate Beckinsale was fine; Shane Brolly as her sexist leader were dreadful. Scott Speedman (one can't judge his skill because he had nothing to do) had the worst part of all, the MacGuffin--or plot mover. He was just tossed around until his big stunt double fight scene at the end.As for plot, the motivation was right out of an afternoon serial. These are creatures of supposed mythic proportions at the end of a centuries old battle...for this? oh, please...It's a darn shame that so much talent in other areas and visual potential was wasted on this flimsy piece of drivel.Let's hope that the sequel will have a bit more thought--and some real characters--behind it."
4,Whoa!,"Where do I sign up to be bitten? Interesting movie--great, GREAT cinematography and costumes. If Kate Beckinsale didn't own you before she will now.Judging from the ending, a sequel is inevitable. Hopefully the plot holes (and there were many) will be ironed out for the sequel.Good clean Gothic fun."
1,rent the Matrix instead,"This is one of the worse movies I have seen in some time. Gore and moody lighting alone do not make a movie worth seeing. The effects were anything but special. It also completely ripped off the Matrix in sound and visual effects. Poorly, too, I might add. Do not waste your time!"
1,"""Blunderworld""","Wow, a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves... ""Underworld"" looked like it was going to be great, but it was a huge disappointment. The story has been overkilled so many times. The action lacks style. The special effects weren't very special. A kindergartner can draw better werewolves with his or her foot. I'm sorry, but do not watch this waste."
3,"Liked it, but just have one question...",I THOUGHT VAMPIRES COULDN'T BE SEEN IN MIRRORS ORELECTRONIC DEVICES! OOPS.
2,Very Dissaponting,"What a waste, I was expcting a very entertaining and cool film judging from the trailers. I was wrong, predictable, slow paced, and, above all, BORING. Too bad."
2,It entertains a little bit!,The maincharackters is absolutley bad acting...the silver car did not fit to this movie...lolthe story of love and 2 arguing famalies are like romeo and julia...its cool story..but the endfight is just ...blua..as the boy gets to the mixture of WW-WP ... they just painted him green...thats so stupid..i expected a big killing monster wich fights against Victor but they just painted this guy with green color..lol what the..fu..
2,Response to A viewer from TN's comments,Despite the movies flaws it is obvious this reviewer did not pay attention to the film. At one point it was mentioned that the coven owns a company that produces plasma and cloned blood. So that's how they can pay for their cell phones.
2,Uninspired,"Underworld had potential, and perhaps that's why I'm disappointed. Vampire vs. Werewolf; its actually quite simple and they screwed it up. The writers apparently thought that Werewolves needed a nerdy name, Lycans and Vampires needed redeemable qualities; they don't eat humans. The point of all this resides in one bad vampire king. I think it would have been much more interesting if neither the Vampires or Werewolfs would have had redeemable qualities. Making monsters act human for the sake drudging along an unoriginal love story with no payoff is just stupid. The only reason I gave it Two Stars is the background scenery, costuming, and some of the special effects."
2,Nice Sets! Weak Movie...,"The nicest thing I can say about UW is, ""Hey, this would look great as a Goth/Industrial club!"" Unfortunately there's not much else positive. Maybe the problem lies with the fact that the premise is so promising... a centuries old blood-feud between lycanthropes and vampires. Had the underlying concept been weaker maybe it wouldn't be so disapointing. But alas, when you make big promises you have to follow through with a big delivery... something this film just could not do.The fact that these unique, legendary creatures would have to resort to a non-stop gun battle is a trite cop-out and it just never lets up. UW never fully takes advantage of the inherent abilities of the monsters themselves and makes them just glorified mortal humans. The plot twists provide nothing to get excited about. Like a few others I had to try for several weeks before I actually made it all the way through. Just boring really and unoriginal while it could have been so much more."
3,UnderEstimatedWorld,"Note: This is not an oscar worthy movie nor are the performances worthy of any golden globe. No way. No how.Ok with that out of the way, what we do have here is an AWESOME KICK BUTT vampire vs werewolf flick that *yes steals from others* but don't all hollywood writers, producers and directors take a little bit from each other? So don't whine and complain. Kate Beckinsale as Selene was the perfect choice (even though she says no more than hmmm 20 sum words the whole movie) and Scott Speedsman is also perfectly cast as the poor smuck who gets bitten by one of the Leiken. The sets, the costumes, and the music (all in errie and bass thumping 5.1 dolby digital - DTS would've even been better - but thats ok) Overall regardless of a somewhat not really there story and very little dialogue this movie I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good popcorn movie that KICKS BUTT and will give your home theater system a serious work out!THREE AND HALF STARS OUT OF FIVE!!"
4,"Nothing special, but a good way to spend an hour and a half","Underworld is nothing more than what the cover shows: a slick looking action movie with vampires and werewolves. That is all it really needs to be, in my opinion. This movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does have some tightly shot action sequences, and Kate Beckinsale breathes uncommon life into the usual cardboard cut-out 'bad girl'."
4,Cool entertaining movie,"I agree with many of the people giving good comments about this movie. The movie feels a bit shallow but it is very entertaining. Yes, we've seen the action before but believe me the movie feels different, i guess because of the werewolf-vampire story.Go see it. By the way, Kate Beckinsale was charming and played beautifully (better than the Matrix's Trinity. And I've no doubt that Kate is a very talented actress)."
5,"underworld is very different from twilight, in many ways...","I watched this last summer, it was a roller coster ride! With a beautiful lead actor as selene and a cute guy playing michael corvin. I had found to be very drawn to selene and michael's relationship, it is unlike an edward and bella relationship and very different in many ways. I love this movie it is the end the very end! Lots of vampire and werewolves, and very little love in the movie. Michael sheen is in ths too his character is awesome I love this movie! I recommend this to any who loves vampire or werewolves!"
2,Bad! The story is horrible!,I am sorry this could have been a movie that had potential. It just got worse! Vampire and guns just don't seem to mix!!
3,Great film. Mediocre DVD.,"I'm not going to review the film itself here because I think the Underworld trilogy is ace. However this particular DVD version did not impress me much. The picture seems murky and so does the audio. It looks like a bad DVD rip, to be honest. In addition the subtitles are big and blocky; not very pleasing to the eye on a larger HD screen.I guess I couldn't expect more at that price."
1,Not a good puzzle,"I was expecting better quality from Learning Resources. It's a cute puzzle, but made very poorly.The wood breaks really easily. The pieces are not cut well and makes it very hard to get the puzzle together. It's a good concept, but not worth buying.We tossed ours after two days."
2,Not that great...,"The idea behind this puzzle is great, but the execution...not so great. The pieces are not cut well and they are very rough around the edges. Also, they do not fit well together. They fit together so tightly that as soon as the child gets one in, another one pops out and it is very frustrating. My 5 year old with excellent fine motor skills even has a hard time doing this puzzle by himself. [...]"
2,les plus grandes chansons vol.1,"This audio CD is a live concert recording, and the sound quality is awful. The lyrics are muffled and the background musicians are barely audible. Nowhere on the webpage for this CD does it say that it is a live concert. You have to open the packaging and inside there is a small notation that it is a live concert (but listening to just a few seconds of the recording makes that apparent)."
4,Great Condensed Version!,"You can decide for yourself if the Golden Dawn Enochian Magic is the right Magic for you after reading this book. The book is a very condensed version of the Golden Dawn Magic but it is great reading, not dry at all and allows you to get your feet wet. If you decide to dive in then your best purchase would be The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic by Israel Regardie. The book is pretty expensive but very much the manual of Golden Dawn Magic. The illustrations are exquisite and many are in color."
2,Thorougly Bad. But you can't fail to learn SOMETHING!,"Bad: 1. Uses Golden Dawn set-up of the elements, something that does not correspond with Enochiana. 2. Uses wrong hexagrams in rituals. 3. Uses unicursal hexagrams, and claims them to be an old, but unused GD-creation.Good: It has all the elemental tablets in the beginning of the book, so when i was going through some studies of mine, I didn't have to flip so many pages to find them. My thumbs are so happy.Although: If you believe that the Golden Dawn tradition has the Complete And Only Anwsers To Everything, this might be a book for you. Else go buy Donald Tyson's Enochian Magick for beginners."
2,not impressed,"In the product description it said, ""...heavy-duty tripod that's ideal for regular SLR cameras and video camcorders."" I use a small Panasoic digital camcorder and this tripod does not perform well. In fact I would be surprised if it did well with a still camera. It supposedly has a ""3-Way Fluid Pan Head"", but it is not smooth in pan and sticks. The mechanism to loch the plate in is also inadequate and loose.I do like the tripod portion (not the head). It is light and the legs are easy to adjust.This is not a prosumer product."
3,Newest Recording of Cortez,"This is the newest recording of Spontini's opera and it has perhaps the best sound quality of any I've heard. While the singing is perhaps a bit wooden, I'd recommend it if only to hear the complete opera without it sounding like it was transmitted through a tin can on a sting. Wish it were sung in French, however, I don't think there is such a recording.I noted that the ""overture"" was quite different from earlier recordings."
5,Can't believe I'm still playing this game...,"Granted, my machine is pretty old and can't handle much more complicated than Tropico. But I still play this game at least once a week. It is that interesting and addictive! The music is wonderful, the graphics are not spectacular but are bright and easy to see on my old monitor, and the gameplay is varied and very open. I like the variety of scenarios as well. If you have an older computer and need a game, get this one!"
3,What it is,"Includes Strategy Guide, expansion, 12 new scenarios, guildbookGood buy if you don't own Tropico"
4,WOW,"It is better than the others because you save so much money and besides, the game is so cool! I mean, it is not every day you rule an island in the ocean."
2,Hmm. Too complex for me,"Well, this game was an okay game. The graphics were good, and the audio was nice and all, but in order to appreciate and have fun with the game, you have to understand a lot of political terms and junk, which I don't, so I didn't enjoy the game very much. Try the demo first before you buy it to see if you can understand it all."
5,Outstanding...,"This was my first novel by this husband & wife team. The story was full of romance, intrigue, and wonderful history. The Boston setting was both quaint and unsettling, as was accurate for the era. Although ultimately a love story, this book also served as a reminder of the sacrifices made by unsung American heros of the Pre-Revolutionary War and beyond. Portia Edwards was a delight; lovely and selfless. Pierce Pennington was a magnificant hero, handsome and intelligent and loyal to those he loved. The secondary characters were interesting and very realistic. Captain Turner was clearly unwell mentally but I didn't feel sorry for him; he was indeed evil. I do look forward to reading the rest of the McGoldrick books."
3,It was ok,"The item arrived quickly but I was disapointed that the clown was prettier in the photo than when I opened it.Packaging was very protected, box was bent up."
4,Old fashioned fun,I really enjoy this movie. It is a fun family movie that gives you that cozy feeling. The actors are a hoot so sit back relax and push play.
2,very dry and uninteresting,"As a 1st generation greek-american I was initially very excited to read this, but found it very difficult to get through. I waited chapter after chapter, hoping it would flow better but found it difficult to get through. It's such a shame as I've got every reason to read it."
3,Good for an afternoon suspense,"This is not the type of novel that will keep you up at night, but the plot has an interesting premise that kept me reading. The book reads quickly, I finished it in a day. The 3 core characters are interesting and involved, although all other characters remain on the periphery. Part of the suspense is derived from the fact that the cat and owner cannot communicate about what they experience. The ending is weak, I think, and attempts to bridge two worlds that are not compatible. Overall, though, the plot moves well and makes the book fun to read."
3,Lacks good characterization but plot is interesting,"HERE KITTY, KITTY is a thoughtful novel about the beauty and the cruelty of nature and left me with both a feeling of hope, wishing the author's world of was possible, and a feeling of sadness knowing in reality it probably isn't. Parts of the story were a bit hard to stomach, the author paints vivid and painful images of the brutality of man and nature but they make the story all the more powerful. Being owned by a cat myself, I can vouch for the authenticity of Billie's character, her scenes were accurately done with care and were interesting to read. This is a book for those with a strong stomach who have a soft spot in their heart for the injustice done to animals in the wild."
3,A potentially good plot with an unwise pivot,"This novel by Leavitt has a potentially good plot as it provides space for portraying the psychology of a mother who is going to discover a homosexual relationship between her beloved son and the object of her own affection. However, the tone first half of the book does not match with the second half's. The first half focuses on the development homosexual relationship between the son and the pianist, and the second half suddenly explores the madness of the mother, and the novel at this stage is centred with the use of stream of the mother's consciouness, which consequently leads to a rather abrupt ending. Still, Virginia Woolf's works and Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS are the excellent examples explaining how to use the stream of consciousness to lead to a (post)modernist ending."
2,Waste of time - Don't bother.,"Flat one-dimensional characters. Unbelievable, unrealistic dialogue. ""Big"" words, pretentious, silly metaphors. Ending completely disappointing and unsatisfying. Many loose ends."
1,Vapid and uninvolving.,"Despite some tantalising glimpses of Leavitt's descriptive prowess (the final paragraph is a ripper), I found this book a real disappointment. The relationships- between Paul and Richard; Richard and Joseph etc were unconvincing, the plot weak and meandering and the denoument (if one can call it that) whimpered, rather than roared. Even the familial relationship (which Leavitt usually explores with panache and compassion), between Paul and his mother, was forced and flat. As another reviewer stated, this book is very 'white bread' and after the wry, sly and poignant 'Arkansas',a great disappointment to me. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library and saved myself some money!"
2,Very light reading,"I wanted very badly to like this book. Set in the world of classical music with all the grandeur and pomp that implies, this story fell flat. A younger man falls for an older, famous man. Not a very original concept to begin with but it gets worse. The mother falls for the older man, the older man's agent/lover falls for the younger man, etc. It's just a mess. There are no truly likeable characters here and even the beautiful imagery of Rome, San Francisco and New York does little to spruce it up.OK -- here's the real reason I wasn't thrilled with it. Not one good sex scene. Nothing titilating, nothing disgusting or revolting, nothing scary or dangerous. It was so white bread middle of the road it was boring."
3,"""Only the mediocre are always at their best."" (- J Giraudoux)","Read all the disparaging comments above, but get Page Turner anyway. It's scenes admittedly don't combine into a perfect concert *BUT* what other author has DL's ability to delineate the dynamics of gays & their families?Imagine mothers @ a PFLAG-type meeting discussing their sons' being bottoms! David Leavitt has the talents of a CAT Scanner and I love his images. As usual, lots of unexpected couplings, reversals and abundant olfactory information.Page Turner also provides a peek into the world of the piano concert business and the cities of New York & Rome. The book was an interesting vacation companion.I read everything DL writes, just as I buy every update to Quicken. Both are always worthwhile!"
4,An extremely thought provoking novel,"As much as people criticize it for the structure of the novel, I feel that the overlying love story between Paul and Richard is extremely touching, they both truly embodies the typical teenager and his infatuation (dare I say love?) with the middle aged man who never seems to be able to commmit. As Paul's character develops, his innocence towards love and relationships can still be seen for his love of Richard. An extremely thought provoking novel......and touching."
2,Where are we going with this?,"Leavitt breaks new ground in a story of middle-aged lust and teenage infatuation. While his writing is still in brilliant form (albeit inconsistently so) and he succeeds in the poignant observations of dilemma and resignation inherent in many homosexual relationships, there isn't much in the plot and characters to care about. The book is essentially a series of sub-plots that aren't sufficiently developed and the abrupt ending can only be described as a plunge into inconsequence and emptiness. Leavitt has been sharper and more elegant in his early novels and short stories. As a follow-up to ""While England Sleeps"" which I consider his best novel, this outing is a puzzling dissatisfying disappointment."
2,Not very good,"I continually read Leavitt's books and am continually disappointed. This time, even more so.There's barely even a book here, just an outline and a few funny passages. The characters are one-dimensional and the ending is just plain ridiculous."
1,Boring junk,"David Leavitt proves once again that he doesn't have anything interesting to write about, and writes about it in an appropriately uninteresting way."
1,"boring, boring, boring","After having read this extremely boring book, I realy wanted to know why David Leavitt wrote it. Just to show us that he knows some facts about pianos and classical music? Normally, one develops a certain feeling for the characters, (well, that's what novel writing should be all about) but in this case, I could not care less what happens to this teenager who is absorbed in his own problems and the other main characters. There are better books around."
3,Getting older,"I think Leavitt is entering his middle age because he's now describing the love and the passion that a middle-aged man can feel toward a young boy, he doesn't speak no more about young love as in Family Dancing, does he? Maybe the time has come even for him... I don't like the end, so sad that the proud Paul doesn't find any love"
2,The title is deceiving.,"The idea was good, but I thought the execution of the story was a bit weak. I kept thinking that something ""more"" would happen with Paul, but was let down when I got to the final page of the novel. The novel ended abruptly, which left me upset that I had spent the weekend reading the novel. I liked Leavitt's collection of short stories, ARKANSAS, and thought this novel would be similar read. Unfortunately, it just left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth."
1,Page Turner? - more like Pot Boiler!,"All of David Leavitt's writing to date has shown a sensitivity and lightness of touch that is rarely encountered. Sadly the current work is crass, clumsy with wince-making tinges of arrogance. The characters are one-dimensional, unsympathetic and implausible. This is much like too many other gay novels that purport to describe the rarified lives of the New York 'A-Queen' set, and are only likely to be of interest to those in that set. I am no literary critic, but I know that David Leavitt is a great writer who is capable of much better than this. As one who has derived great enjoyment from his writing I hope 'The Page Turner' will prove to be a temporary aberration. Avoid - and keep your former impressions unsullied."
2,Leavitt's weakest to date,"Imagine a book, half set in Italy, about a younger man's relationship with a (famous) older man, with a silly mother figure who weeps constantly and finds out her son is gay when she looks under the bed...Sound good so far? Thought not. It seemed to me that Leavitt thought he'd better write a book called The Page Turner before anybody else did, then pretended to himself that any old story would do.Very nearly a waste of time."
3,round the world in eighty days,I very like this book and i wont that you send me the books and i very thenk to you.
3,Information is dated,"Based on other books and research on the web, I found the information to be rather dated. However, the personal stories of people coping with scoliosis are helpful."
1,scoliosis,"I thought this book might be interesting as my kid was recently diagnosed with scoliosis. It was a bomb. Boring and not very realistic. Not current with practice and excluded all non conventional practices including correct diet and alternative health practices of living with scoliosis. If you just want to hear repeated what your child's orthopedist told you, read this book."
1,More Liberal whining,"If you are a member of the Labour Party, this book is for you. If you have any sense of economics and the demands of the world economy you will quickly realize that this book is a bunch of bunk. More liberal/labour whining about how ""Unfair"" the world is"
5,A Gift of Flavor and Health!,"I'm on Atkins; my girlfriend's on the Zone. Too many diets for one couple? It was until she gave me Deborah Chud's beautiful book. It works with both diets, as well as the ones our friends and relatives are on (Schwarzbein, Protein Power, Sugar Busters!, Carbohydrate Addicts, and all the rest). It's also great for people who aren't on ANY diet (like my Dad), who might like to cut back on carbs for weight loss and cardiovascular health. Before receiving this book, I faced a steady stream of low carb meals lacking flavor and imagination-- with no one to blame but myself. My girlfriend rescued me with The Gourmet Prescription. Now we're eating Grilled Shrimp with Spicy Cashew Sauce, Roast Chicken with Rosemary-Garlic Paste, Porcini-Laced Veal Roast, Spicy Greens with Roasted Tomatoes and Peppers, Roasted Garlic Asparagus, and Hot Sesame Green Beans. Is anyone on your Xmas list on a low carb diet? GIVE THEM THIS BOOK! It's a gift of flavor and health."
3,The Gourmet Prescription,"Although it's a beautiful book filled with inspiring and delicious recipes, I must now buy a stove top smoker to prepare most of the recipes presented. I was disappointed that the majority of recipes required a particular piece of kitchen equipment - it's like buying a bread machine recipe book without owning a bread machine. Although smoked food can be tasty, I fear I would tire of the smoky flavor. I will try the recipes that don't involve smoking, but I don't see buying a smoker just to try the rest."
5,Flavor plus health can equal delicious,"Most healthy recipes are bland and boring, but this interesting, well written, and beautiful book made me want to cook and eat according to Ms. Chud's Gourmet Prescription. Usually, I skim a book, buy nothing, and forget about it, but this time I actually ordered the stovetop smoker and plan to use it."
5,Dessert aficionada,"I am a dessert aficionada. My eyes run first to the back of the cook books. Appetizers, chicken and fish are afterthoughts. Not so in Deborah Chud's ""Gourmet Prescription"". From the foreward onward, Dr. Chud's personal, seasoned experience is intrinsic to each recipe. I never thought I could get so close to an onion with so much savor and so little tears. Her tomato dishes have taken me on a Journey far beyond the boredom of salads. Now when I see plum tomatoes in the grocery, I'm eager to roast or smoke them. She makes each recipe sing, especially the short selective fruit desserts- and that's even without my favorites: sugar/flour and butter. Kuddos to Dr. Chud for bringing new healthy adventures to my table."
1,Not a gourmet cook,"If you have cornichons, ume plum vinegar, adobo sauce, white truffle oil and fenugreek in your pantry, this book is for you. I, however, donated mine to the local library."
2,More work than it's worth?,"This is a beautiful book, and the recipes sound great, but all I had to do was read the first 20 pages to realize ... this is NOT a cookbook for anyone who has a life. Does the author truly expect me to spent 4-6 hours every Sunday smoking vegetables for the upcoming week? I am convinced that I can be healthy by practicing moderation and learning to listen to my body - perhaps the Zone and low carbs can help - but until I can be a full-time, stay-at-home cook, I will need to rely on other ""real-world"" cookbooks."
4,Very funny at times,Mike Epps is hilarious. Him and Ice Cube seem to have good onscreen chemistry. The torture scene in the bathtub had me on the floor. All Mike needs is the right script to take hime over the top like Chris Tucker
1,Terrible!!!,This movie [is bad]. It is a waste of time to see. Its worthless and annoying. None of its funny and Ice Cubes fame is the only reason this movie even has a chance!
3,Ice Cube goes through the motions,"I hate to be negative, but Ice Cube has been involved in some much better movies than this. It's not a terrible movie, since it has a few good laughs and some cool action sequences, like the wacky opening scene. But it's not exactly the most creative storyline, and I wonder if the people involved were really putting their full effort into it. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought that Mike Epps was pretty funny. The bad guys were pretty cool too, and Ice Cube did an okay job with his acting. Overall, not a great action movie by any means, but worth a look. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."
2,too much swearing :(,"every other word was F--K and MF, so I was disappointed with it! I still love Ice Cube though."
2,all about the benjamins gets all about nothing after awhile,"yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you."
1,Yikes!!,I Don't even wanna remember this junk.Ice Cube is a Cat that back in the day Made Some truly Great Music but after around 95 He truly fell Off&became one Big Logo.while I applaud His Success His work as a Film Maker&Music Maker leaves alot to be desired.as for Mike Epps? He is about as Funny as a Byron Allen Film or anybody that has Served as Host of the MTV Video Awards Show after Chris Rock.in other words it's very Wack Company.the Stunt Camera Work was interesting for a minute as was the Background Music in places but overall you gotta No.
2,Trite,"The Fridays gang steals some diamonds. Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be. His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve. Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin. Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something."
3,It's... o.k,"A great cast, but sadly not a great film. It tries to intertwine it's charectars ( a la MAGNOLIA), but hardly gets even close to that kind of genius. Some of the charectars were very well written (Jeff Daniels in particular), but some were off the wall ascrewball (Gary Sinise doing a Bill Gates impression or Josh Brolin just being stupid as a video clerk), and I didn't feel they worked. These types of films are meant to focus on charectars, but I just didn't feel compassion for them (Anna Paquin, ugh!), and oh, did I try! Funny and poignant at times, and a great monologue by Joan Allen, keep this film afloat, but after the first half hour, It's the Rage is...Well... It's not so great."
2,Scattershot,"Based on a play (which I've never seen), ""It's the Rage"" follows an ensemble of coincidentally linked characters either perpetrating or victimized by gun violence of all kinds. The ultimate message-a gun is the only thing separating an ordinary but otherwise stressed out person from becoming a murderer-seems reasonable. But the film's flashy and shallow textures undercut its own serious agenda. Or maybe it's the other way around. In either case, ""It's the Rage"" may be intriguing on its Tarantino-esque surface and commendable for its anti-gun social message, but the film can't help but fail as these two impulses fight it out. Ultimately, ""It's the Rage is bloodless in every sense of the word."
4,back up batteries,i purchased these batteries as a precaution for when/if power is lost.Last time going to the store just before the storm the crazy people trying to buy batteries were really pushing everyone.Not worth it
2,battery?,"Well they shipped them promptly, they were well packed, a fair price...But they were half dead to dead on arrival should've expected as much it's the chance you take when shopping online :/"
2,Quickly drained batteries,Used these batteries in flashlights that we bought for our kids. The batteries didn't last 24 hours in them before they needed to be replaced.Spend the extra money and get batteries that will last! Wish I did...
5,Excellent Deal,"My husband buys these regularly for his Xbox controllers. These are a great deal, and last for quite awhile. Will purchase again."
5,C batteries that saved Christmas,"Nothing is more disappointing then to have a Christmas gift that you are eager to play with , but it takes batteries and no one has any. I went to my daughter's house for Christmas with this pack of C batteries and a pack of AA's. It saved Christmas."
3,as you would guess...,They are batteries! They go in flashlights and such make them work. They are round with a shiny end on each side.
1,"Poor Writing from a ""Professional"" Journalist","This book is written in such an amateurish style -- with scads of misspellings (""sicsinct"" for ""succinct""), bad punctuation and terrible grammar -- that it made me doubt the professional status of the writer. Do editors in Hollywood really hire this woman to write?Her advice is scattershot at best. The layout of the book is a mishmash of fonts, type sizes and pull-quotes. There's no flow to the chapters; no valuable advice. There are lots of photos (as amateurish as the writing) of the author with various celebrities, going back to the early 1980s.If you're looking for real tips and strategies for dealing with professional media, look elsewhere."
2,A lot of hype...,"Lot's of flash, but no real substance. Her advice to reduce everything to soundbytes may work on tv, but doesn't carry her through a book."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the upbeat ending and Karl Malden's 5-minute long rant seem not to jive with the rest of this intelligent and downbeat script, On the Waterfront is a fine showcase for Brando and a solid film; I feel uneasy about the way it defends those who named names in front of HUAC or McCarthy, but that doesn't spoil the movie."
4,"""One of Marlon Brando's best films""","It's not hard to see why ""On The Waterfront"" won the Best Picture Award in 1954-Great actors like Marlon Brando,Karl Malden,Eva Marie Saint,& Rod Steiger-Memorable dialogue like ""I coulda been a contender""-Great screenplay by Budd Schulberg & superb directing by Elia Kazan-If you haven't seen this film before,what are you waiting for?"
5,Pleased,"The DVD was promptly shipped, and in excellent condition. I would recommend this seller to anyone."
2,Suprisingly Disappointing,"Everyone has seen clips of Brando's performance in this movie and it is commonly referred to as a classic so I was disappointed to see how poorly this film has aged. I guess at the time it was considered gritty but now it seems a very stylized, almost phony, grittiness. Brando does his Method acting thing and he's brilliant of course but the dialogue he's given is for the most part, horrendous. Brando doesn't have the benefit of Tennessee Williams' talents here as he did in Streetcar Named Desire. The dialogue creaks along with a lot of embarassingly bad speeches that seem unlikely to occur on the docks. Both Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint give wooden performances. If you go into it knowing you're seeing a creaky melodrama and just want to see Brando do his thing, maybe you won't be disappointed. But I was expecting a lot more."
5,One of Hollywood's Most Uplifting Moments,The story of Brando's charactor's decision to fight for whats right regardless of personal consequences. But to me the star of the show is Karl Malden who plays a Catholic Priest willing to put his life on the line to live as Christ told him to. His speach following the murder in the cargo-hold is one of the most inspirational moments in all cinema.
5,One of the major achievements of Elia Kazan!,"Elia Kazan was one of the challenging directors in his time. This film meant a true landmark in the category of movies which showed with merciless the underworld linked with the sindicates. Marlon Brando (30) won the Academy Award in 1954 with this incredible performance. With this one Brando added another aditional achievement to his kinetic career . Very few actors in the world are capable to compare with this outstanding actor.Eva Marie Saint made a worthy acting. Rod Steiger , Lee J. Cobb and Karl Malden also were extraordinary . The script was simply marvelous, direct and without any hole and with splendid art direction.One of the top movies in the american cinema."
5,Hall Of Fame Film,Marlon Brando this is the Kind of Film that is timeless.Marlon Brando showcases His Chops&the Man shows Why is One of the Greatest Actors Ever Period.what a Battle? He wins you over here.Karl Malden is solid as well.I see the outfit that lead to the Streets of San Francisco.no matter what the time period a Classic Film has no Date.it captures so much&more.
3,"Great film, poor transfer",The movie is among the best ever made; it is beyond reproof. Period. But the transfer is an embarassment. Good grief! There's a moth fluttering about in one scene on the screen they used for the transfer. A moth! Didn't anyone actually watch this before it was released?
5,A Classic,"Tough, realistic, and poignant story. They were all good actors, but this was really when Brando was at his best."
5,Gritty Drama,"On The Waterfront was released in 1954, but even today, it remains one of the grittiest and uncompromising films of all time. Director Elia Kazan examines the seamy underworld surrounding the shipping docks in New York City. The starkness of the black and white cinematography adds a sense of despair. The main reason to watch this film, though, is Marlon Brando. His portrayal of a has been boxer is a text book example of method acting. Mr. Brando chews up the screen in every scene he's in and gives one the best performances of all time. There are some excellent supporting turns from Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and a young Rod Steiger. Mr. Brando finally won the Best Actor Oscar after being nominated 3 times prior and Ms. Saint won Best Supporting Actor while the film took home the Best Picture award."
5,The Greatest Movie of All Time,"On the waterfront, in my opinion, is the greatest movie ever made. It had everything pathos, romance, and while it did'nt have a happy ending(a big plus) it left you as life sometimes does unresolved but with a feeling of hope. When I first saw the movie on WOR years ago I think thats when I first became aware of injustice and the courage of those who fight(most times against the odds) injustice and prevail. I truly believe that whatever activist leanings I have started with this movie. Very impressed Stings now as it did then. A must see for its subject-might v right, it's acting-method- and the direction of one of the greastest film directors of all time.Who directed the greatest actor this country has ever produced Marlon Brando."
2,"Brando is excellent, but ...","Marlon Brando's performance is still watchable: subtle, surprising. So ... just damn good. He clearly modified his part on the fly, to make it compelling and real.But the movie is barely watchable: melodramatic, unreal, unceasingly moralistic, and the music by Leonard Bernstein is so badly over-the-top it makes you want to scream. The rest of the actors are all sporting their soap-operatic gestures and their radio voices and their canned character quirks. The script is well-structured but the dialogue is terrible ... except in Brando's case: he's like a magician who's stumbled into the middle of a high school play.By the way, the DVD is full-screen, not widescreen. Which is a shame, because the cinematography is quite interesting. The features on this DVD are worthless."
3,Benefits from on location filming a lot,Plus a lot of outdoor scenery in that on location. Gives it realism. Look if this movie had been made in a Hollywood studio it would of been only half as good. Brando did well but he's vastly overrated here on this site. There really isn't any swearing or other 3dimensional behavior by characters in film. I think for sure it was a combination of elements more than just MB himself.
5,The perfect film,"Since this movie has been analyzed for 50 years, there's no need for that here, so I'll just register my personal feeelings about it. Seeing this movie 10 years ago, in my immaturity, I thought it was ""boring"". After re-watching it now, I have to say that this is probably the perfect film. Realistic, dramatic, didactic, with the superb acting of Brando- wow! I can hardly think of a way that this movie could have been bettered. If any classic deserves its reputation, it's ""On the Waterfront."""
5,Simply The Best,"On the Waterfront, in many ways, is a profound, deep and provocative picture. The acting is superb, led by Brando, who reaches out beyond any acting in any other movie. He is so natural to an extent that you will forget that this is a movie but reality.I have seen this movie many times, with each viewing I tend to indulge more and more in each and every tiny detail. Elia Kazan has a done a wonderful job. Also the casting is unparalleld.This is a timeless classic that is essential to any movie library."
5,It is a good movie!!!,I believe this was an interesting movie. I especially liked all the actors in the movie. I strongly recommend that other people definetly buy this movie. It is a smart buy!!!
3,Great Stars in a Dated Film,"Presents many great stars in the prime of their careers--Brando, Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint (in her first starring role.) Yet, in the context of contemporary standards. the plotline is clearly dated, and the acting somewhat histrionic and stereotypical. As a result, the viewing experience is just not as good as one might expect given this film's classic status."
5,Brando At His Coolest!,"As many times as it's been imitated, you cannot help but be moved when Marlon Brando says 'I coulda been a somebody, I coulda been a contender'. Truely a classic and an asset to any video collection."
4,"Not like HorrorMan ""HM"" Described","It's just a movie and it's not meant to (nor does it claim to) be based on the actual book of Revelation, which in and of itself may very well be ""fantasy."" Don't take yourself too dang serious.This film has dream-like imagery and an understandable plot if you keep it simple and don't try to base it on (or compare to) your religion.I don't agree with the negative reviews, but I certainly understand.Peace."
3,"Small film, apocalyptic premise","THE SEVENTH SIGN(USA - 1988)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby StereoCarl Schultz' supernatural drama is a very low-key affair, despite its apocalyptic premise (the impending birth of a young woman's unborn child threatens to unleash God's Final Judgment on the world), but it establishes and maintains a genuine sense of impending doom all the way from the opening scenes in Haiti and the Negev desert in Israel, to an uncompromising climax in the execution chamber of an American jail.It failed at the box-office, partly because it doesn't live up to its ""Omen""-esque potential, and partly because it's simply too clever for mainstream acceptance. The dialogue is laden with resonant phrases and descriptions, and viewers will need to pay close attention to catch many of the appropriate references, all of which have a bearing on the characters and their quest for moral redemption. A small masterpiece, ripe for rediscovery."
3,check the region!,"this took over a week to ship even though I live in NC which is where it ships from. the dvd would not play because apparently there are ""regions"" and the US is region 1, this movie will not show in region 1. the seller did though respond promptly, and supposedly is sending me a refund or a region 1 dvd. I had never heard of ""regions"" before, so be sure to check that if you're buying a dvd here"
5,FANTASTIC MOVIE,"I really enjoyed this movie, saw it in 1989, but watched it again tonight on cable, and I still say this movie is fantastic. The actors are great, the director is great, and the film overall is great. I cry at the end everytime I see it."
5,"Most underrated film I can think of, it is simply awesome!","A fantastic film worth watching over and over again. Demi Moore's best performance. Jurgen Prochnow's (David Bannon) performance is remarkable and unmatched. I love Apocalyptic films and this one is up there with The Omen in my opinion. Best quote of the film: David Bannon speaking to Avi: ""Remember it all, write it down, tell it; so people will use the chance she has given them."" A great last line for any movie. Watch this movie hundreds of times and I guarantee you will never get tired of it. After viewing the film for the first time I suggest that all people take David's advice and stay close to God no matter what your religion is."
1,Confusion & Nonsense,"This movie is such a mishmash of nonsense that I could not watch it to the end but turned it off part way througgh. I found the character Demi Moore played repulsive, doing illogical things, illegally entering the room of the renter & examining his things, etc. I have read and studied the Bible for over 40 years & am well acquainted with what it says concerning the end times when God judges the world. Opinion here was presented as fact among other things. There is nothing in the Bible of which I am aware that indicates a baby can be born without a soul - soul-less - & be alive. A body without a soul is dead physically. Such a baby is referred to as stillborn. This movie is just confusion & chaos. There are apocalyptic movies that make sense but this is not one of them. It is a total waste of time"
1,Hideously bad.,"Demi Moore's tortured screams of ""Noooo! Noooo!"" at the end of this garbage heap of a film were very appropriate, since that is exactly what I was thinking after realizing I had wasted 90 minutes of my life on this incomprehensible nonsense."
1,The vhs tape broke my player,"It broke my tape player. I like the movie though. The movie is very entertaining, though not very scriptually sound."
2,The Seventh Sign,"I remember seeing this as a kid and thinking wow how scary? and seeing it again thinking the same,but I take issue with(SPOILER,if you Have not seen it,do not read further)The Priest being portrayed in the utmost negative light,GodForbid the Rabbi or some Moslem is portrayed like that in Hollywood.The whole end of the world thing reminds me of the ""Left Behind"" stuff from Protestant sects and how they take advantage of Revelations,the way God is portrayed as a Vengeful God A-la Old Testament,it seems to be like a typical Protestant taking advantage like they do with Sola Scripture.The movie itself is not bad nor does it seem to be blasphemous(I could be wrong),the acting and Jesus seems very intense,But nobody knows when the End of the world is they say not even the Son."
1,Not Biblical,"The Seventh SignNot Biblical,the movie try to rewrite Bible Scriptures, by misquoting them. Poor story line. It is not worth buying A Christian or non-Christian buying. Don't waste your money I gave it one star rating, but it don't even deserve that. I threw it in the garbage because it is garbage."
3,"Messiah with a German accent, why not?","All the characters are very annoying. Not too intellectual either. I guess, those who like Demi Moore will like the movie, I am not one of them. Three stars out of respect for Jurgen Prochnow only (What is he doing in this movie anyway?)"
1,brainless catastrophy,"one of the worste movie of all time. senseless script, overweight actresses, no budget FX, demi moore looks like a trailer camp bumer and yet she was choosen to save the universe.zero. the bible is used to explain the script for 1.5 hour and then, chazaaam ho after all little jesus changed his mind, the end of the world is for some other day.big laugh"
1,Poor quality printing,The quality of printing of this book is the worst I've ever encountered. On many pages the last sentence is missing or the bottom half of the lettering is cut off. The Amazon return/replacement process is absolutely blind to the problem since all they did was send out another copy of the same poorly printed book. Frustrating.
4,"Good book about flying in the most exclusive ""club"".",This is a very good book on what it takes to fly for the Israeli air force and fight against arab terrorist in the skies.Highly recommended
3,Pretty thorough lambasting of an unlikable character.,"If you're a follower of the Kennedy saga, there may be little new material here in the biography, JOSEPH P. KENNEDY. But it's interesting and highly readable. It covers everyone from JPK's ancesters in Ireland to Caroline and John Jr.'s generation. Jackie comes off well. But there are a lot of unpleasant things about Rose I'd never heard before. And there are things I knew about but never knew the truth behind -- like the tragedy of Rosemary.As I read the book, I thought he made statements that would be considered controversial. But as I read on, and looked at the notes and bibliography, I realized Mr. Schwarz did indeed appear to be well informed. It's oddly written, with some really long sentences and some anecdotes stuck in totally out of any time sequence. If only for the insights into the worlds of politics and Hollywood, it's well worth your time. And it's pretty enjoyable."
5,Great Game,"Love this Game! My husband's family grew up playing this game and It is hard to find in this board game version in any store. The game I bought had age to it, but we are okay with that because it is exactly like the one he grew up with and that I have learned to play."
4,Two For One Video Game Classics For Mac,"A seller at Amazon featured this game for an excellent price. The game is actually two classic games: Original Bejeweled and Alchemy designed to work on newer Macs. Bejeweled 2 is graphically more pleasing to the eye, but the original game still has its charm. Alchemy is also a great symbol puzzle game. The games run pretty much flawlessly on new Intel based Macs and provide hours of relaxing gameplay."
3,don't bother,its such a small container and really this stuff is in most blended rabbit foods anyway
5,Bunnies' Delight,"My 8 Bunnies will even kiss me in the morning--as long as I have a can of Ecotrition in my hand ready to pour a few precious kernels onto their fresh bunny food. These 'treats' for bunnies are like feeding kids spinach that tastes like chocolate; now wouldn't you like to find THAT food? Well, for the bunnies, it's all in this little can--beans and greens or nuts and veggies, best try a little bit of both, but get a few cans when you order, your bunnies will thank you, too, with the kiss of anticipation and appreciation."
4,Can't wait for summer.,This product actually shipped with another hat and came to me as pristine as if it were encased within a steel box. Bravo!
4,fun,I purchased this for my 1 and 2 year olds. After reading reviews I made sure to find a space to fit it. We also inflated it a week before the birthday part to clear any plastic smell.Since it's so big the kids did find it before the party but they love it.Plan to get at least 300 balls though. I probabbly spent more on balls than the ball pit but it's worth it because the kids play together often in there.
4,Good Buy,"I give this ball pit 4 stars because my niece loves it! However, I would agree that it looks bigger than it is after you get it blown up - and you do need more balls! I bought this for my 13 month old niece - and she absolutly loves it - however after only 2 months with it - it is starting to rip at the seams in some areas - this could be due to the fact that she doesnt care to use the door on it - she just climbs over the edges. However, i gave it 4 stars because it is one of her favorite places to play - its like her little playhouse! Also great buy since I have amazon prime and didnt have to pay for shipping!!"
3,"Fun, but not durable enough.","We gave this to our 2 yr old for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. I did buy extra balls when I ordered it and that helped a lot. Sad part is by the 3rd day we had a whole in the front street lights. The good part, it is constructed with different areas holding the air so the whole thing does not collapse. But it is difficult to re-seal with patches when the leak is in the seam. She loved it, but it is tough to maintain."
4,Good for the value,"Unlike a lot of other users, I had no problem with the smell, however, I did set it outside in the yard for a few hours prior to blowing up the first time, I didn't unfold it or anything, just took it out of the box. I thought it was going to be huge after reading other reviews, in my opinion it was not huge, but was larger then most ball pits. I did buy 300 more balls and that was perfect. I have a 3 & 5 year old and they love this. It holds up to them. I don't leave it up all the time, only a few days at a time, like on weekends, that way they don't get bored with it. Definitely buy more balls for it. Also I don't know why it is called Slide'n play as there is no slide anywhere on it."
2,ripped and deflated,This ball pit would not stay inflated. It deflated the first day we got it. It would not keep air in it no matter how many times we pumped it up. The seems ripped in many places. This would have been a great product if it were made better. Good news is that Amazon accepted my return of this product and refunded my money.
4,Birthday party fun,"Purchased for my Grandson's first birthday party with older children in attendance. We planned on having the party outside with other activities however, a tropical storm prevented that. We cleared the dining room, set up toys and the smaller size ball pit in that room. The kids had a blast! Kept them occupied the entire party. Even the older kids said it was the ""best party ever"". Durability of the product is great."
2,"HUGE, leaks, kid loves balls, pit not needed","Bought for my 9 month old, will crawl in and out, even with her weight, it leaks and needs to be inflated in the front for use each time. She loves the balls though. If id didn't leak it would get a 4, obviously it is poorly made. I paid $[...] with free shipping, so for that money it is great. Wife hates it though due to its enormosity."
4,Josh & Noah's mom,When I bought this back in September Amazon was selling it for $[...]. Now it is $[...]? Something is wrong there. For $15 it is a great toy but I can't see spending much more than that on it. I bought it for my 2 year old's birthday party but even my 8 year old had fun playing in it. The lamp posts popped after just a few days but the main part of it was fine for a few months. After 4 months it started losing air really quickly and I couldn't find the leak so we had to throw it out. My 2 year old asks for it almost everyday so I am planning to buy another ball pit but would never spend what they are asking now for it. I can't imagine anyone would spend that much on it. It certainly isn't worth it.
4,KK's mom,This gym is a perfect size! My son got this for his 1 yr birthday. he enjoys climbing into it on his own and throwing the balls around. Con- should come with more balls. Got to go out and purchase extra.
3,Big ball pit but pick up extra balls and pump,"This is a good sized ball pit. However, it comes with only fifty balls and your going to need about four hundred and fifty to fill this pit up. I was also a bit annoyed to find no pump was included.My one yearold loves jumping in it and the seperate air chambers are a plus. If they told you that you would need to purchase more balls and pump on the box I would have given it four stars."
5,My son loves it....,"I love the ball pit. All the kids that come over to the house love it also. I bought it thinking it would entertain my 10 month old son. He loves it. The only thing that I don't like is that it only comes with 75 balls and that isn't nearly enough balls to put a dent in it. I had to buy 300 more ball to put in it. Also it says that it is a slide and play ball pit, there is no slide to it. I don't know where they get slide from. But overall we love it now that there are lots of balls in it..."
3,you will never know where the air leak is on this toy,"This is a very good toy in terms of fun...but once it gets an air leak,you will never be able to detect it unless its a hole. I bought this for my 15 mth old daughter for some summer fun. Unfortunately, its in the box, because after playing with it indoors for three weeks it leaks air and i cannot find the leak."
3,one month toy,the toy is great to play with while it last. but after about a month it is already coming apart at the seams and wont hold air. the toy is great but the durability of it sucks
3,The ball pit......,"I would rate it with 5 stars had it come with more balls. It includes 75 balls, and when reading it, that sounds like plenty. Well.....It isn't. The 75 don't even cover the bottom of the play area. Outside of that....it is a great buy. Just make sure when ordering, that you order additional balls. At least another 75-100."
3,"Not Bad,,,,","This toy was ok, and our daughter loved it. It was a bit of a chore to blow up, and a huge hassle deflating it for storage. It's impossible to fit it back into the box to put it away.Our biggest complaint was the small amount of balls that came with it. There weren't even enough to cover the bottom of the ball pit. It also had a hole in it after the first use.Not bad for the price, overall, but we will definitely be buying more balls to put in it."
3,Smaller then it appears,We got this for our 16 month old for christmas. It looks bigger in the picture then it is and we were a little disappointed with the size. Our 5 year old wants to get in and play with his brother but there really is not enough room for both of them at the same time. Other then that it is fine. Our 16 month old is happy with it so I guess so are we.
4,My daughter Loves it!!,I have a 16month old daughter and she absolutely loves her new Ball pit!! It's very durable. It does need to be reinflated about every 3 or 4 days depending how rough your child is with it. Also there aren't nearly enough balls that come with the product. I had to go out and buy two more packs of balls just to fill it. So If your thinking about purchasing this product make sure you buy plenty of balls!!
