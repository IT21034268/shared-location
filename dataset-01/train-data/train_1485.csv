3,Darwin's Delimma,"The Cambrian explosion is viewed and explained. Filmed fossil discoveries of four different continents today, this documentary shows and explains how inexplicable this explosion of life was in Darwin's understanding. It then shows how the mystery has only become more and more inconsistent with evolutionary theory. Narrated by scientists and scholars, this documentary will appeal to a person wanting to understand and discern this issue as it relates to origins of life. It would not appeal to someone for light entertainment."
1,enough,"please. the world is and has been a natural and evolving entityit is a HUGE leap from finding as yet unsolved problems with darwinism(and how many ARE solved. how much evidence!) to creationism, a truefairy tale and the last vestige of primitivism."
2,"Back to school, creationists!","It shouldn't surprise us that the legitimate scientists interviewed, such as Dr. James Valentine of Berkeley, have since distanced themselves from the film, claiming they fully support the evolutionary explanation of the Cambrian Explosion (which lasted nearly 100 million years; not such an explosion after all). Dr. Valentine in particular claims he had no idea the film-makers were intent on attacking evolutionary theory.In contrast, the other talking heads such as a Richard Steinberg, Stephen Myer, etc., don't have relevant PhD's in the field, and are associated with the Discovery Institute, who are single-mindedly promoting so-called Intelligent Design (although the film, deceptively, refers to it by name only once near the end).The oddest claim of the 75-minute film may be that body designs are not specified in DNA. Did they somehow miss classwork on HOX genes? In the 21st century, we expect more than that."
1,The Religious Method,"Once again ID proponents start with their conclusion in mind and then look for evidence to support it, ignoring any that doesn't. Fancy graphics + faulty logic + pre-assumed outcome = Fail."
5,A Problem With Evolution,"Darwin's Dilemma was the Cambrian explosion of new animals and new animal body designs in a very short window of geological time. There is no evidence of the transitional forms that Darwin's theory requires in this stratum. According to Palentologist Stephen Gould,""The fossil record had caused Darwin more grief than joy. Nothing depressed him more than the Cambrian explosion."" Darwin's theory of life forms evolving over time through a multitude of small, undirected steps is still unaffirmed. After 150 years of continuous searching of fossile beds all over planet Earth no transitional life forms have been found. Scientists and scholars answer questions about the Cambrian explosion and the inferred Intelligent Design in this documentary. It is very well designed and produced."
1,more ID bull.,"Intelligent design is an oxymoronic inanity. This is more deceptive garbage designed (not even so intelligently) to promote a sentiment which insists that science is a threat to religion. If you want to take in real science, read Gould's Punctuated Equilibrium. That's a real discussion and examination of Darwinian gradualism."
5,Darwin's Dilemma ; real stuff,"For the cerebral in search of knowledge ; this is 'documentary' and informative . If you enjoy the debate of DARWIN vs. the FACTS , or are the opposition , you can listen intently to a clear presentation of fossil history .I most certainly recommend Ben Stein's ""Expelled ; NO intelligence allowed!"" as a companion . Ben has more humor with many of the same PHD/scientists .So , pull out your grey matter and popcorn . I sat through this twice first evening . Nicely done ."
2,Disappointed,I fell asleep watching this video. The Cambrian explosion must be interesting to biologists and paleontologists but for a layman like myself I was hoping for a more dynamic presentation. I was truly disappointed.
1,Funny,"This film was hysterical.I liked how once it became obvious that the aim of the film was to promote the theory of intelligent design the rhetoric came fast and furious.They alluded to the fact that the chemistry of the seas in the Precambrian were different than during the ""explosion"". Since arthropods use the minerals dissolved in the sea as their raw materials it might have bearing on why the left no trace earlier. I rented this on the basis of the picture of the trilobite in the listing. So I had a good laugh at myself when the whole ""no watch without a watchmaker"" argument was used.I recommend David Attenborough's ""First Life"" instead of this show; although there were some nice pictures.They also left out the Ediacarafossils of Mistaken Point that date from the Precambrian; some of which display primitive arthropod features."
4,I bag to differ,"The four star rating reflects the term ""large"" in the bag's advertisement and the questionable purpose of this bag. In quality, it is a 5-star bag all the way w/o exception -- for a point and shoot or hybrid (point and and shoot w/ interchangeable lenses). It IS NOT for a dSLR unless the dSLR is small and has a small standard non-zoom lens! But, what owner of a pocketable point and shoot needs a bag!? with a shoulder strap!? with an exterior zipped pocket!?"
1,Way TOO small,"The bag looks good so there's no problem there. The problem is that it's too small. Somehow when viewing the picture, I thought it was larger. In fact the description even says 'large"". Dont be fooled.It couldn't hold my Canon T3 and one lens. The fit was too tight and I had trouble getting them out of the bag. About the only thing I would put into that bag is a small point and shoot camera and even then it would be difficult to add anything else.This is a very small bag. If you need something to carry your camera and lens in, this is not it."
5,Great value especially w/ free shipping,"I had an amazon prime account so this product cost me a total of 1.99 dollars. For that price, it was an excellent deal. The bag is synthetic leather of course, but it's still better quality than ones made with textile material as it is waterproof and has a high gloss look to it. The only immediately cheap looking part of the bag is that the straps are connected by plastic not by metal but I don't expect it to break anytime soon. Fits my canon 350d dslr perfectly with lens taken off and placed on top."
5,A story you won't forget,"Intuition is more than just the name of a beagle. Intuition walks alongside all of us. It cries out, it licks our face, it will lead us out of danger and guide us to glorious places. We just need to learn to listen to it, trust it, unleash it.Take the time to really read this book. It may appear simple on the surface, but there are so many important messages and layers for those willing to pay a little extra attention. (just take a look at the discussion group at the end)Want to learn about life? Want to learn about business? Want to learn about motivation? Want to learn about spirituality? It's all in Free The Beagle.Some books are forgotten days after being read. This story will stay with you for years to come.p.s. Listening to the CD is even more fun than reading the book."
5,more magic from the wizard...,"Free the beagle...its as simple as that!An uplifting and ingenious insight into our world (personal and professional) provided, once again, by the wonderful Wizard of Ads!You'll learn something new and be challenged through every sentence!"
5,a deeper meaning,"Upon first review, this book seems like a cute little story with some obvious symbolism that any fool can interpret. It's not until you get to the end that you realize just how deep and profound this tale goes. I've read it 3 times since I bought it last month and each time something jumps out and smacks me in the face. I'm willing to bet that the next time I read it, something else will get me. Unfortunately I've got a list of friends who I need to lend it to first, so I'll probably have to buy another copy!"
1,Inspirational Pamphlet,"""Free the Beagle"" is clearly written for the same audience that will inevitably write five star reviews for ""The Secret."" Barely scraping by at 86 pages, with liberal illustrations and plenty of white space, the book actually relies on ""discussion questions"" and a round table conversation in the appendix of the book just in case the reader somehow missed the overt symbolism.And as the Matrix sequels made abundantly clear, hidden messages do not a great story make. Unless you enjoy hearing a smarmy narrator try and convince you that Faith is a prerequisite for a successful life (never mind atheists, agnostics, and unbelievers)or a business, depending on your interpretation, then be sure to leave this read on the self-help bookshelf, where it belongs along with other pretentious and painfully shallow and superficial works. Hardly qualifying as a book, I can only guess how poorly its sequels turned out."
1,This is biased-stereotypical text,"I do not recommend teachers purchasing this text if you work in a public shool. The age recommended is 3-8, but I do not think that this would suffice with my first graders. They are left hanging and wondering. I am sorely disappointed. I expected much more factual information about the true traditions of each country as opposed to actually Christmas, as Christmas is not the majority celebration for most of the countries listed."
1,Religious celebrations only - not celebrating different cultures,"Any ""cultural"" info included in this book is drowned out by the religious celebration traditions. It often seems to almost demean the other fabric of the childrens lives that is not christian.I bought the book to use it to teach different cultures and traditions around the world, but it is a book about ""selling"" christianity. I understand Christmas is a christian celebration and would definately include that in our studies, but there are already many, many books that cover that aspect, like the bible for one. Don't waste your money on this book.Do not buy this book for any other reason other than to see what it's like to be a christian in other countries as viewed through a christian's eyes only. It is not a diverse piece of literature. Quite the contrary, it falls far short of that."
3,LIGHT READING...,This was the first zebra regency romance that i read. I was a little dissapointed even though overall i liked it. For some reason it just seemed far fetched to me that throughout the whole book..Villiers and Laurentia...are so much in love but never have thoughts beyond kissing..PLEASE!!
4,Poor Little Rich Girl,"I have always held a fascination for people who grew up with a real sense of religion that later fell away from the faith. I bought this book expecting something akin to the movies that are so prevalent nowadays about the catholic schoolboys smoking and getting caught by the nuns and hit with a ruler across the wrists. Instead, I was greeted with an amazing tale of Mary and her sad loss of her parents, pitiful existence with her aunt and uncle and twisted ""saving"" by her West Coast relatives.The childhood she had was less than perfect, I agree, but the fact that she survived it and lived to create such a wonderful literary account of it almost makes me appreciative of her having to go through it. The chapter on her grandmother is so reminiscent of my own mother that I had to laugh out loud at times.Well worth the read and the struggle through the many latin references and unfamiliar religious practices."
2,A Conglomeration,"This is the type of book that I think of as a conglomeration but not really a book. That is, she had published several magazine articles, then gathered them together and made a book. I find that style difficult to get into. She glossed over too much; so many years were packed into just a couple pages.It irritated me after I kept reading and reading, and she kept criticizing and criticizing the people who raised her after her parents died. I sure didn't blame her for criticizing her father's side of the family. But her criticism didn't end with them. She didn't have many kind words for anyone."
1,Have these reviews been put up by the company?,"If you read the other reviews of their dishes it is like night and day to these. Others beware because I do not believe these reviews are legit.My review of their products is:Beware, Beware, you will be burned twice!My husband got burned severely after putting the microwave proof mug in the microwave. Was treated by a doctor several times and missed several days of work. He was scarred and still sensitive. The company made us jump though hoops with documentation of the burns and expenses incurred. In the end they said they would not reimburse us and it was not their responsibility.Burned by the mug and burned by the company.Beware of this company."
3,"Works well, but way too expensive","Portable air conditioners are popular in parts of Europe and Asia but never here in the States. They differ from our traditional window- or wall-mounted ACs in that they reside entirely inside, hence draw air from inside the room. There's an exhaust hose that connects to the outside. The upshot is they are energy efficient and work well, but for mysterious reasons they are really expensive. Probably because they are niche markets. DeLonghi is the best brand in this category and the EER rating on this 10,000 BTU unit is high while you can still run it on regular 110V, no need for converting to 220V as with older 10,000+ BTU ACs. The DeLonghi appears to be well built and it has four wheels so you can move it around. But the high price... If it were less than half of that, I think everyone should get one."
1,Leaks water!!!,"Within 30 days of periodic use, this unit has leaked water, thoroughly soaking the oriental rug on which it was placed. Further, the water soaked through from the second floor to the first and dripped on our leather chair. I have followed all installation and use instructions to the letter. The included Service Manual from DeLonghi provides no ""troubleshooting"" advice only a State listing of authorized service centers--of course this happens on the weekend.This disappointment comes on the heels of a 2 week delivery time using the ""Free Super Saver"" shipping.Overall, highly disappointed with this purchase and trying to return the item."
1,"More Heat, Less Cool","I bought one of these a few years ago and couldn't wait to return it. When you have an AC unit in a room, it generates heat -- there's a reason that a window unit hangs *outside* the room. There is heat dissipation along the exhaust hose also, and at the window: if your window has 2 sections, the heat can rise just outside the lower section, and re-enter at the window dividers. At least, understand that a 10000 BTU unit in the room does not equal the same outside the room, because the room is not insulated from the machine. I had this unit in a small bedroom -- maybe it was windy in there, but it really wasn't any cooler. The unit did act as a dehumidifier, and required a fair amount of emptying. Anyways, don't, don't buy this thing -- it does nothing, and it's expensive."
4,five summers later no problems,"I bought this in 2002 because my landlord doesn't allow window units, due the dripping and ugliness factor of window units. This machine has worked perfectly for five years of extremely hot summer days and nights. I set it on maximum cool and fill it with water twice a day. Spent a lot of money, but well worth it! Yes it is heavy and noisy and after five years it rattles a little. I spilled candle wax down it by accident two years ago but it still keeps working! One thing I have been doing that may be the reason for it's trouble free existence is that I flush it every summer month with descaling fluid."
3,adequate.............,"The instructions were not real clear , but a person with an average amount of mechanical knowledge would have no problem . My main complaint was the 3/16 diameter screws used to fasten the bracket to the Olivea LCD .The 37 "" weights in just under 50 lbs . The WM30D comes with an assortment of larger bolts , but they would not work with the Olivea .Other than that the WM30D is well made and adequate ."
1,No Intructions = Confusion,"I bought this and had to take it back as it did not come with any instructions on how to install it, plus there are a large number of extra parts to make it compatible with a wide range of LCD/TV's. However, how am I supposed to know which parts go with my TV? The quality of the wallmount itself seemed to be fine, but I will never know how well it would hold up because I couldn't get it installed."
3,"Good Mount, Minor Problems","Mount worked out O.K.. Got it properly mounted, but not without difficulty. Instructions contradict actual mount. Instructions say don't overtighten mount to TV, but only gives you a few round holes which don't line up to the 27"" Olevia TV. You end up using slotted holes, which means the entire weight of the TV, to kept it from slipping down is dependent purely on how tight you make the screws. Could have been designed better considering it is an Olevia mount for an Olevia TV."
3,Africa,A good historic perspective of the Eastern African contenent its history & progress to the present day;
2,Workshop poems,"Matthews' book, like many others being published these days, suffers from the dreaded workshop flu. These observations, unfortunately, fail to rise above the everyday, because it's as if anything strange, unusual, vivid or unique has been edited out. She's a careful craftswoman, but the ephianies remain buried in a system of images and symbols that don't tell us anything new. It's a shame, and a disappointment, that she doesn't trust her own voice more thoroughly. For a book in a similar style that soars above to truly engage, try Claudia Emerson's the Late Wife."
5,A New Literally Light is Shining!!,"I simply loved this book, Put this one next to your langston hughes collection. Amazing first effort."
5,"Cozy, Sweet Read","Deborah Raney has created a lovely story of mistaken identity, healing of broken hearts, kindness of neighbors, and the strength of Love in lives. The characters, Madeline, Adam and Ginny grow on the reader's heart like ivy on trellises. If you want to read a book that stirs the heart and leaves you smiling, this treasured gem is the one!"
4,Witty,"Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Delightful and uplifting, it's a book I'd recommend to anyone."
1,Product is ugly,Product is ugly and doesnt complement the gorgeous looks of the Treo 650. Returning it...
3,ok with mods,"Pros:*The Belt clip works well and it is easy to remove the phone in one motion.*I think the case looks pretty good and fits snug.*The plastic over the keys actually makes them easier to press with your stylus.Cons:The plastic.*The plastic over the screen is definitely a problem. It is hard to touch the screen with the stylus without significant amount of pressure and it is even harder at the edges and corners. And you can pretty much forget using your fingers.However, I just cut the plastic off from in front of the screen which basically solves that problem.*The plastic over the 5-way button also makes it harder to use. I will probably cut that off too.*The plastic over the other buttons means you can't really type by feel alone. (like feeling for the dimple on the ""F/5"" button)Overall I wouldn't recommend this or any other case with plastic over the screen unless you're going to cut it off. Or maybe if there's one with the plastic molded to the exact shape of the front."
1,flimsy & poorly engineered,"I wish we had read these reviews before buying; we just returned from 5-week 4,700 mile vacation using this rack with the 2"" adapter. We had to use bungee cords to keep 2 bikes from wobbling around. The plastic sleeves the bikes sit on moved a couple of inches during the course of travel so that frames were not parallel. The plastic straps did not prevent one bike from slipping off the forward end of the carrier. The front of the bike was stopped only by the rear bumper of the vehicle. We're past the 30-day time to return this piece of junk, so it's headed for the trash..."
1,NOT for 4!,"I bought this bike trailer in a pinch a week and a half ago just prior to a road trip. The greatest decision I ever made was throwing the receipt in my wallet...Just in case. Well, 1200 miles later midnight last night, ""Just in case"" stepped up to the plate. The bar that extends from the hitch 1 1/4"", bent slowly, like a banana! Yesterday morning, it seemed like it was slightly bent... by midnighht, the men's bike (highest of all) on the outermost space had about 7"" of clearance.... :-( Talk about an emergency... I'm 1200 miles from home, in rural PA!God bless Craigslist! I ended up driving about 2 hours (R/T) to solve the problem...If you need to mount 4 bikes... you're going to have to ""suck it up"" and get the 2"" fitting. The conversion kits are an inferior solution."
1,Do not buy this one!!,"This bike rack is faulty! You have to snap the ""buttons"" in order to secure the bikes. If you use it as much as we did during our travels this summer, your fingers will be raw on the tips from trying to snap buttons repeatedly. It ""wobbles"" from the hitch, also, no matter how much you tighten the bolt. I definitely do not recommend this product."
4,Love the Schwinn Hitchrack 4,"I bought this rack at Target yesterday and paid $108 plus tax. Far less than the $250 the bike shop wanted. I installed it today on a Toyota 4Runner and the assembly and installation were extremely simple. I installed this in a 2 inch hitch. Contrary to other reviews complaining about instability and wobbling, this rack is extremely solid. I'm assuming the complaints are coming from people who simply didn't follow the instructions or didn't use all the right parts. The tilt down feature is a little less than elegant but seems to work fine so far and allows me to easily open my tailgate with the rack attached. I would definitely recommend this rack to anyone (assuming they can read and follow instructions)."
1,Does not engage securely on a 2 inch hitch.,You would think your bicycles were mounted on a metronome the way this rack sways back and forth. Zero Stars.
4,Sturdy Rack for the Car,"This bike rack does a great job of holdig the bikes. It is very sturdy and I love how the tie downs work. It is nothing like bike racks of long ago where you had to use bunge cords and rope. It was a bit hard to assemble, the hitch nut that goes inside the receiver pole would not stay still while mounting. We ended up having to tape it in place and then it worked. I also like that it can adjust so you can get into the trunk."
1,Too wobbly for comfort,Bought it; set it up and stuck in on. Loaded bikes and feared for my life! Far too slack a fit in the 2 inch hitch for this thing ever to stay vertical; off by a good 30 degrees; tried to shim it but no joy. Packed it up and returned it within the hour.Am buying the Allen 4 Bike rack based on good Amazon reviews.
2,Too Wobbly!,"The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy! I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn. I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch."
1,DANGER - DO NOT BUY!,"One word for this product: GARBAGE! We just purchased this rack to carry our two bikes. We have a 2"" hitch, which is supposed to work with this rack. The bolt which is provided with the rack is barely long enough to work with the hitch. The rack was incredibly unstable and ultimately caused the cheap plastic setting inside the hitch setup to strip, leaving the bolt spinning freely. When we returned home, after a total use of 8 hours for the rack (4 there, 4 back), because the plastic piece securing the bolt was stripped because of instability, we were unable to detach the rack from the hitch and had to have it cut off the SUV!!!! What a piece of garbage. Not only should you not buy this product, but they should find the engineer who designed it and fire him/her and then find the manager who approved the design, and the groups that tested it, and fire them all!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible bike rack!!!!,"This is the worst bike rack ever. Wobbles like crazy, afraid to drive for fear the bike rack will fall over. Tried lots of things to try to make it better, but nothing seems to help. Don't buy this bike, it is useless."
5,A wonderful retrospective of rural Manchurian-Chinese life,"Wonderfully written and beautifully illustrated book about the lives of the Chinese in the Manchurian frontier land before the Communist revolution. This is a Chinese rural life set in the abundance of the newly opened Manchuria, a time and place very different from the rest of land hungry China. The lives of these pioneers reminds one of those of the American pioneers of the Midwest prairies. The people in the story are brought to life as they make a living in this land of freezing winters, wolves and endless landscapes."
1,I just didn't like it,I read the description & bought 2 copies - one for my father-in-law and one for me. It may have encouraged him to finally start writing down some family stories but he made no comment about the book which means he didn't like it. I could not get into my copy although I have tried several times -- and I usually finish every book I start. I did not think the writing was that good & it did not get my interest.
1,I Have to Agree With the One Star Review,"I thought the illustrations were nice, a bit childish for an adult book, but still nice, and that's what the one star is for. The writing was atrocious. It wasn't even grammatically correct. Like the other one star review, I couldn't get into the book because the writing was just so bad. I feel sort of bad for the author, but maybe she should stick to illustrating. She does do that well."
4,Small powerful product but not while you are driving,This is product is really cool. Audio quality is good but it didn't work very well while I was driving. Also hooking this unit to the phone is also bit tough. I couldn't feel/hear the snap sound when it latches with the phone. I wish there is a better way to hook this to the phone.
5,Works Great - Nice and Clear,"As soon as I opened the package, I called about 4 people to test the clarity, and it was great. When you dial with the speakerphone attached, it sounds like the volume is too low, but it does get comfortably louder. Everyone I talked to say they heard me clear, and I heard all of them clear. I love it in the car also. It is very lightweight and pretty easy to stick in your pocket to use everywhere. The only thing I would add, is allowing voice-activated dialing while it is attached. And it would be nice to have a plastic carrying case to protect it while taking it ""everywhere"" I go."
4,Its Very Convenient...,I bought this speakerphone a few weeks ago and it has been great using it when i am driving or shopping on the internet ( HA HA ) Its definately a handsfree system that should be available for every cell phone. Those stupid ear strings get in my way. Don't like them!!! Well I love my speakerphone... thank you Amazon for directing me to the right to where i need and for the seller you were also great. thanks
5,A Loving Family in the 1920s,"My family and I discovered this book on a summer vacation in Cape Cod. Ever since, whenever we've found it at used book sales we've snapped it up to give to friends. Warm, hilarious, endearing, inspiring (to parents hoping to create the same quality of memories for their own children), this book, though set in the 1920s and very much a part of that era, is in its depiction of family relationships, timeless.One of my favorite memories is of my father, a dignified man, now deceased, attempting to read aloud to me a section dealing with Pop and the Reader's Digest... he was chuckling so hard he was hoarse and had to stop and wipe tears from his eyes. (Twelve years later I can still see him.)Buy this book and dive in for a wonderful read."
5,I'm Never disapointed in Joan Hicks as Miss Marple,"When I picture Miss Marple my minds eye sees Joan Hicks. Such a wonderful portrait of Agatha Christies slueth. I've enjoyed this title time and again. Some one is murdered at the Vicarage of all places, who could have done it and why. The ex-wife, the lover, the unhappy daughter? The ever observant Miss Marple can piece it all together. Some people think these A&E Miss Marple movies move too slowly....but if you love Agatha Christie (like me) you will not be disapointed."
3,"first, ignore the title","The title 'Action Hero Superstar' is quite misleading, songs are generally personal and emotional, and not ironic or humorous. (The lyric booklet contains lyrics for a song the CD was named after, although if the song is on the CD I couldn't find it. It doesn't seem to belong with the rest of these songs anyway.) The vocals on this CD remind me of the Cranberries, although there is never the bellowing of songs like 'Zombie'. I found the tone of the CD to be inconsistent, it is too boisterous to fall asleep to, yet too quiet to be enjoyed while driving."
1,Don't read this book if you're happily married,"For all this book was touted as a look at divorce and life with exes, it was really just ""Karen Karbo's personal life."" Whenever she had a chance to expand her scope, she ruthlessly restricted it. When she had a chance to discuss issues on a broader level, she brought them back to the personal. And what a peach of a personal life it is, too. I've never felt quite so soiled by a book. Perhaps it's a sign of her power as a writer, but by the end of the book I was questioning my own very happy marriage. So now I'm warning everybody I know about this book. If you're happily married, and you don't really want to look for reasons to contemplate what divorced life would be like, just stay away."
4,"Tour De Force, a bit chaotic","Excellent idea, nolte, coburn, and spacek carry this movie through a somewhat chaotic script. Different, deep and thought provoking, unlike most mindless dribble comeing out of hollywood."
1,What a waste of talent!!,Slowest dumbass movie I've ever seen!! Nick Nolte & Sissy Spacek must have been hard up for money to be involved with this garbage!!
2,Boring,Very boring and drawn out. Not one of the best Nick Nolte movies I've seen for sure. Even Sissy Spacek has done better than this.
2,so-so,This started out ok and then got weirder and weirder as it went on. I don't know if it was the editing or the strange dialog or the odd storyline. The filthy language was offensive too!
5,Reality Supreme,"An all star cast brings to the screen the decisions that everyone has to face atsome time or other during life; we are what we are because of how we were raised.That is not to place blame on parents for something that we have done on our own;but, to analyze the basis behind the action. This conundrum is so greatly shownin this film that it should make each and everyone of us sit down and think aboutwhat we have done or are about to do; it is the individual's decision, not someoneelse's. To compare this film with a natural disaster such as an earthquake or avolcanic eruption will show the viewer how well the actors in this film show theheart wrenching decisions we all face on a daily basis."
2,B O R I N G,"I have to admit right off that I didn't watch the whole movie, perhaps the ending was worth it but you'd have a hard time convincing me of it. I watched an hour and 15 minutes of this movie and just couldn't see continuing. At this point in the movie I had a fairly good idea of where it was going to end - seemed to be a cover-up, that quite a few people were in on a murder. No matter - it was very slow and very very dull and boring. If the ending was exciting as heck it still wouldn't be worth sitting through this to get there.Obviously, I would NOT recommend this movie."
2,Bad,If not for Nick Nolte it would be the worst movie ever. Can't believe he was in this. It had no attraction really from beginning to end.
4,Excellent acting,Both Nick Nolte and James Coburn gives a performance of their career. And with co-star Dafoe and Spacek nearly as good this movie is a craftmanship in acting. One of the best movies of the last decade.
1,This is a very DARK MOVIE!,This is a very dark movie. I would not recommend in to anyone unless you just want to feel bad about life!
4,POWERFUL,"This film is a little gem. It is slow, sad, uncompromising and contains exceptional acting! Nick Nolte is such a powerful actor. His and James Coburn's performances are the heart of the movie. Coburn won the Oscar, but Nolte's part of an abused child who's now a loser of an adult is sooo good that I can't see how HE didn't get the gold instead of Our Man Flint! The final scenes with the final confrontation of father and son are extremely powerful and some may find sort ofhard to take but they are worth waiting for! Willem DaFoe gives a good uncharacteristic gentle performance too. It's good to see Paul Schrader behind the camera in top form."
3,Sobering movie about child abuse,"The movie is really about the long term effects of child abuse. It's subtle to see at first but it becomes obvious as the movie progresses along. It's got a good cast of characters but the subject matter is depressing. Although I watched the whole thing, it's not a movie I want to watch again."
4,AFFLICTION!,"From director PAUL SCHRADER, the man who wrote the scripts for ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull,"" comes this POWERFUL DRAMA about VIOLENCE in the male world! Adapted from RUSSELL BANKS' novel ""The Sweet Hearafter,"" this film features a couple of powerful performances by NICK NOLTE and JAMES COBURN (in his OSCAR winning role)! Nolte plays Wade Whitehouse, a small town cop whose life of failed relationships, hard drinking and repressed agression is about to EXPLODE! Coburn plays his ABUSIVE FATHER in a first-rate SUPPORTING CAST that includes Sissy Spacek, Willem Defoe and Jim True! The Nation's Film Critics picked Nolte as BEST ACTOR n 1998 in what is far and away is best performance. He might be an OVERLOOKED actor, but do not overlook this OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE!"
5,Really Hit Home,"As the son of an alcoholic, this movie really moved me. Nick Nolte's acting is top notch and the sense of sadness and foreboding (Wade's tooth) make for a gripping story. James Coburn did an outstanding job of playing a drunken jackass, hence his best supporting actor win.It's a depressing movie for sure, but one that will leave you assessing who and what are important in your life."
1,Affliction,"I hated this movie, it was long and depressing and I didn't see any point. I wish I had never paid to see this movie. I love the actors in other movies, but this one was horrible."
4,A Surprising Book,"I never expected this book to be anything but horror. I was pleasantly surprised by it. The author shows he can delve into the life and relationships of mainstream fiction without blinking an eye. Even if you don't read much mainstream you should read this one, it's a book that will make you think."
4,Straub is Excellent as Always,"Although this is not really a horror novel it's still a great work. The focus is on the family dynamics and relationships of one man, a musician returning home for a vacation and to give a concert in his local area. The characters are intriguing and mysterious. It was fun to watch Elliot come to terms with the people and events going on around him.A great book for anyone who appreciates Straub's work. I highly recommend it."
3,Bought for more than the content,I purchased this book first for the fact that I am on the cover. I actually read it and found that it was ok.
5,Awesome!,"I don't even know what to say about it. It was just great! There were times I had to catch myself from calling it stupid. I realized though that it wasn't the book, it was just my reaction to what some of the characters did and unfortunately people actually do those stupid things. I have to call this book reality-fiction because as far I know it wasn't meant to be non-fiction and it was so well done, I wouldn't feel right calling it just fiction. I can see this book as a movie and I casted everyone in my head as I read. Until then, you'll just have to settle for the book and I definitely recommend it!"
4,I enjoyed it!,"I enjoyed this book. It was different. In the beginning, it started off slow but once it picked up...I couldn't put it down. Although I enjoyed the dialogue, the ending could have been much better. Good luck to Mr. Johnson on his writing career."
5,sleeper hit,"This book is definetly one of the sleeper hits of the year 1999/2000. The book is superbly written with charachters that are believable and so real you can feel their pain throughout the story lines. This story is told from an african american males perspective about what happens when a parent walks away and does not contact his sons for years. Can the fences ever be truly mended and what excuses, reasoning or logic could that parent have to explain to his 3 sons the reasons for losing contact. I highly recommend this book to men and women of all ages, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is truly a must read!!!!!!!!"
5,Just Brilliant!!!!,"This book touch my heart, with the opening pages regarding Julius having cancer. I was able to fully relate to him trying to reconcile with his children. My dad has the same illness and he is facing his own fears of making peace with his children. R.M. Johnson touch on many fears that a family torn apart faces."
5,A Jawdropper.,"What an incredible book. I stumbled upon The Harris Men by accident. I was glued to the page as I watched these men unfold before me. Johnson is a terrific storyteller. Please, please, please, please, please tell me there's a sequel."
2,LACKING MUCH SUBSTANCE,"I was very anguish to read The Harris Men from so much of what I heard about it. I opened my mind and delve into one of the worse books I have ever read. The characters are beyond unbelief. None were captivating or really very smart.Someone could have been strong,but they were all really pathetic. Better Luck next time Mr. Johnson."
4,Growing up fatherless...,I really enjoyed this realistic story of a family torn apart by the father's absence and the effect it had on the sons and their relationships as grown men. I could definitely see the author in his characters even though I haven't met him.As soon as I finished I was ready for the next book!! -ES
2,not as expected,Not original to the album with this cover. Some of the songs I had never heard before. I guess it was a marketing ploy and I fell for it. Not recommended.
3,music critic,"CD is ok, but growing up in 60's and 70's i don't remember ever hearing most of there""greatest hits"", they must have made it to the top of Americas hit parade bottom 40.I saw the Vogues live back in the late 60's they sang a few of their real hits, it only lasted about 30 minutes, hard to believe that some of these songs on this CD could be listed as Greatest, i guess just to fill out the CD. Wouldn't buy again."
4,A very good Greatest Hits Collection.,"I basically bought this CD because I loved two songs off it, ""5 O'clock World"" and ""You're the One"". I was having a hard time finding them without the dubbed strings added and was very lucky to come across this about 8 years ago on tape. This CD takes you on a trip through the evolution of a group of guys whose voices blend as well as any group. The music is as beautiful as any that came out of the 60's. The problem here is after you finish listening to the CD you feel unfulfilled. There is no chance taking here. The Vogues found a style to be successful and pretty much stayed with it. That doesn't take away from the music, but it does make you wonder how good they could have been had they attempted to stretch themselves.I would recommend this for any music lover looking for ""easy Listening"" music. I still occasionally pull this out and enjoy it, and you will too."
2,Disappointing CD,"There are three songs on this CD I like: Five O'Clock World, You're The One, and Turn Around Look At Me. Everything else is disappointing, a bunch of B-side-type songs ready-made for elevators. Most lack the crisp, bright rock sound that I associate with the Vogues, orchestrated instead by 101 strings. My advice is to buy the songs you want individually and skip this CD."
3,The Vogues - Greatest Hits,The songs are some all time favorites and the harmony just makes you feel so good inside.
4,slamminsteve say enjoy the LOVE !,yes this is a kinda corny CD but let's be serious nah let's not. Let's just sit back with that special someone ...or yourself and enjoy this CD of LOVE!
5,Light hearted and funny for all ages!!,We loved this book! Both my husband and I read this to our 5 yr. old son. We laughed out loud at the author's light hearted approach on learning to ride a two-wheel bike without training wheels! A first time on reading a story by this team of authors. I will seek other books by them in the future. My son loved everthing about this peticular book.
5,scope up the clean,"These bibs are absolutely great for little ones learning to eat.The method of how they are formed and catch the food makes clean-up so much easier for parents. Thanks,"
4,Left a Lot of Unanswered Questions!,"This book is okay. It's interesting and does answer what life was like during the Pearl Harbor attacks from a teen girl's point of view but I felt that the author left some questions unanswered in the end. We could have read more about what happened to Amber Billows and her family. I'm not sure if this book was based on a true account or just historical fiction.It's an easy read and a welcome edition to the series that focuses on a girl's viewpoint during a critical time in American history but I felt that the author cut us short about Amber's family and life after they returned to the mainland. Amber's father was a reporter covering for a New York City paper but based in Honolulu when the Pearl Harbor was attacked.I think the author could have also described in more detail about the attack downtown. Of course, there is some reference to it since Amber's mother is a nurse who went to the aid and life after the attack in Hawaii was never quite the same as before."
5,Early Sunday Morning,"This is one of the first Dear America books i have ever read. I rated it 5 stars because it was an easy book to follow and very educational. It help me understand a different point of view of what it would have been like to been there on the day on Peral Harbor. I think this would be a good book for someone to read that has trouble reading or doesn't like it all that much because i have to say i would be one of those people. This book is fast, fun, easy, and wonderful! If you want to find out what it was like from a person your age then this is a great book for you!"
3,Way too short!,"When i first bought this book I read a lot of reviews saying that it was really short,but I didn't really listen because I LOVED the movie Pearl Harbor so much and I was dying to find something about it.This book, while maybe good for 9 or 10 year olds it is way to kiddishly written and too short for a person any older. It barely even mentioned Pearl Harbor and the attack only took up 2 pages!If you are a teen (or anyone else) looking for something really in-depth about Pearl Harbor try reading the book based on the movie called...guess...Pearl Harbor!It's really good and it differs from the movie so it's not like a flashback.Back to the book, it really would have been good but it seemed as if it were written in a hurry and the Epilogue was really disappointing! All in all I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good.,"Even though I am not a huge fan of Barry Denenburg's writings, this is a very good book. The story of Pearl Harbor is one that will be remembered forever. I had been wondering if they would make a Dear America about it. Anyway, this a very interesting book, especially for those,like myself, who are very interested in World War II"
1,In the trash bin!,"I will not be finishing this book with my child. About half way through the book the author uses the word ""godd***"". Not only is this word offensive to me and my beliefs, but it also has absolutely NO place in a child's book... NO place. I sincerely hope the other Dear America books do not contain language such as this, as if they do they will join ""Early Sunday Morning"" in the trash bin!"
3,An Okay Book,"I liked Early Sunday Morning, but it didn't seem long or interesting enough. On the other hand, my best friend LOVED it. It did give a good glimpse of what it nwas like early that Sunday morning."
4,excellent but short,"This book was one of the most excellent Dear America books I have read. It was well written, and to the point. I will let the other reviewers tell what the story is about because they have done a good job at that, but here are a few pros and cons.Although the story WAS short,it was short for a reason. The writter starts a new diary every time she moves. The story did not leave me ""hanging"" as I would have suspected from so short a story.My only objection to this book was that the writing was unrealistic considering the age of the person writing it. The girl was supposebly 13, but the book read more like it was written by at least a 15 year old.This book is well written, entertaining, and informative. I recommend it."
3,Okay,"Barry Denenberg has done better than this, but I still thought it was an okay book. It was sort of cheesy. The conversations went like, ""Here's your coat and hat? What's your hurry?"" when people were leaving their home after a dinner party. They also start paragraphs for no reason, like they would just put ""Yummy."" I am not saying that that is wrong in any way, but I think that it is just kind of annoying, especially after talking about sweet potatoes and yams.This book is about a girl named Amber Billows who is 12 and lives with her Mother and Father and Brother, Andy. Andy likes planes and on December 7, 1941 his knowledge comes to use identifying the Japenese planes attacking Pearl Harbor. I thought that part was sort of weird, but, who cares. Well, you may want to read this book to find out."
4,Earley Sunday Morning Review,Early Sunday MorningSummaryThis book is about a girl named Amber Billows who experiences the Pearl Harbor attack. She always moves her family can never settle down and she hates this. Soon they move to Hawaii and right after they get there Pearl Harbor is bombed. She makes a new friend that is Japanese is worried because her dad was taken away by the police. Amber's dad and older brother (Andy) went out and found the dads' location and the family felt better.I like this book because it has very good transitions. The book is very fluent and good for fluent readers who don't like choppy books. It is very smooth and flows well.I dislike this book because it could stand a bit more description other wise it was wonder full.From a one to five with five being the highest I would give this book a four because I could stand a bit more detail other wise it was over all great.
3,Not that good,"I didn't really like this book. It barely had any thing about what happened December 7th. It was some what interesting, but it had hardly any thing to do w/ it's subject. Not really worth reading. Even if you know every thing or if you know nothing about Pearl Harbor, this isn't a good book. I won't be reading(or recomending) this book again.~Atalanta"
4,Awesome!,"This book was awesome and a little sad. It gave a great insite on what happened at Pearl Harbor, to kids especially. Barry Denenberg wrote this book very well. If you've enjoyed other Dear America books then you will this one."
2,"Poor Quailty T, Nice design.",I received my YES shirt in a package marked large. Inside the package was a poor quality thin extra large shirt with no tag showing the size or care instructions. It was a nice design though. Gave it to a larger friend.This is the second review I have made. The frist similar one seems to have been deleted.Bob
3,Not a bad little film to pass the time,"Well...I was quite surprised by the film to be honest. I am a big zombie movie fan and this was a nice distraction. It is very campy and even a little bit silly at times, but there are some out and out good scenes here too. Don't expect Romero, but all in all the film holds together and the zombies look creepy."
2,Prison of the Bi-guys,"First of all, this movie is not scary at all. The characters walk around the prison until they are frozen in place at random and then killed. You do not feel for any of the characters, and you can't even cheer them on since they just get stuck where they are before you even know they are in danger and then it is over for them. This film is a great example of horror writers who have no education on the basic elements of horror.Why should you even check this film out? This film is quite progressive on the issue of sexual minorities. There are three bisexual guys in the film. One who hits on another character, while the other two reflect upon their sexual history with each other. It comes as quite a surprise in this film because it seemed to come out of nowhere. It inadvertently normalizes the experience of sexual minorities and is worth viewing for that reason alone."
1,DEATH ROW,"Poorly done zombie flick that never scares up any scares, and has some preposterous gaps in credibility and editing. Where in the world did the blood come from that brought the executioners back? Why was the most despicable character in the movie the only one who survived? What was this thing about Bill being hired to beat up Christoph? Huh?....no one in the cast can be accused of acting; you may recognize Samuel Page from ""The Brotherhood"", but the rest of the cast is pretty unknown and will probably stay that way.Directors should also realize by now that watching zombies move slow mo in their death walks is about as exciting as (one of the characters in this movie says: An episode of Baywatch Nights).Ho hum."
2,Pretty generic,"No surprises. I confess that I do not know this genre very well but it seems pretty generic without much to make it stand out and make up for poor acting and predictable story and script. I did like the setting and the lighting. One reviewer says three guys were bi. Maybe, but maybe they were just ""modern"" youth -- and if that was the only unusual element in the film, then more could have been done with it to add a little more drama. So all in all I see this as a generic B college-age-students-and-somewhat-creepy monsters film in a cool setting."
3,"Prison of the dead So, so...","Now a days its hard to find decent horror movies, however iam a big fan of the b movie genre anyways. So, i headed down to the video store and Prison of the dead caught my eye. The tagline ""Theres no parole in hell"" seemed interesting and it was a full moon so i gave it a whirl. The acting was not all that bad and the 3 prison guards looked decent. However the scares and the gore were just not there. I suppose the director elected to have the viewer use their imagination on the kill scenes (blah!). If you like some plot twists and an overall errie feel give it a chance."
1,I've seen some crappy zombie movies in my day but this one takes the cake.,"I have never ordered a zombie movie from Amazon and then felt like I wanted my money back until this one. I am a huge zombie fan of novels and movies and any other medium that the genre is exploited in but I have to say this was the biggest disappointment in a zombie move ever. Those other people who gave this movie a good review must be the friends and family of the director or something, either that or we didn't watch the same movie. I mean is it me or were the only zombies we see in the movie the same clip shown over and over of some cloaked guy ""rising"" from the dead? I could go on ranting all day but suffice to say the movie stank and if you are a huge zombie movie fan like me... if you have a brain you will probably hate it."
5,Incredible!,This was the most incredible Zombie movie I have ever seen. State of the art special effects and wonderful acting. Superb storyline and incredible directing. A++
1,escape while you can!,"I was going to give this movie a harsh review, then I noticed the single review that already existed for this movie. The person loved it! So I thought that perhaps I had selected the wrong movie. There is no picture for it listed.But just in case there is only ONE Prison Of The Dead let me just say this. No action, no killing, no prisoners! If this is the movie I remember,then the only good part about it was that at the end they interviewed eact actor. It was sooooooo funny, because these actors were taking the interview so seriously, like they were on Johnny Carson's tonight show (the movie seems that old). Anyway, do not waste your time on this one. I'm off to find a good movie to review now."
1,this movies blows!,"if you can get this movie for under $3.00 do it, otherwise leave it be. youd be better off to sit in front of your tv with it off for 80-something minutes.not even really a zombie movie. there are i guess what you would call zombies, but they dont eat any one. everyone knows that zombies are hungry for flesh. it looks like the movie was made in about a week on one set. theres a tease of seeing some erotica, but then your let down hard.unless your a stoner and can sit and watch bad movies, just for watching bad movies, steer clear of this one."
1,negative infinity stars!!!!,"The movie starts when these annoying yuppies go to a prison. One of the yuppies performs a ritual that's suppose to scare the other yuppies. But it was a joke. OH but the ritual actually DID did raise a whopping 3 zombies from the ground and they hunt down and kill those fools (YES! THEY ALL MUST DIE!!!!!! I ACTUALLY WISH THEY KILLED THEM IN REAL LIFE!!!!!) and turns them into zombies as well. :) So one final yuppie survives the whole thing and that's all! THE END!OK! I HATE THIS FILM WITH SUCH BURNING HATRED!!!! The acting is so annoying, I actually punched the T.V. to try and shut them up!Especially that one yuppie who kept licking his lips (that should tell you something). Everything about this movie is stupid!!!!!!(not many zombies)most entertaining part: when all those yuppies DIE!!!!!!!PEACE, and RESPECT :)"
1,"typical Disney: looks good, no substance",This disk has very little to recommend it. It's little more than a collection of dinosaur-themed games -- and pretty uninteresting (and annoying) games at that. Nor is there any educational content to speak of. My six-year-old son lost interest in it after about 10 minutes.
2,NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE,"I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THIS GAME. THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT PART OF THE GAMES THEMSELVES,THEY ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SEGMENT.BE AWARE THOUGH, THIS GAME TAKE UP ALOT OF SPACE FOR ANYONE WITH AN OLDER SYSTEM. THE ONLY PART MY 5 YEAR OLD SON ENJOYS IS THE DINOSAUR BUILDING GAME."
3,Dont Believe The Cover!,"So I only bought this DVD because it featured Kasey Potteet (Myspace babe and AKA Diana Prince porn starlet) I thought the series would feature allot of episodes with her but was kind of sad that shes only on one episode. The show has a variety of actors and its not like they are in more than one episode. Its a ""reality"" show in the vein of The Real World and to be honest its a little on the tame side, I have really seen soft core porn that is more explicit. Oh the episode that featured Kasey, eh not really worth it, she gets all snobby and bratty so she is kind of a pain through most of the episode, shes a real buzz kill but she does have one decent sex scene and is featured in a badly filmed ""threesome"" so I would skip this dvd or at least buy it used like I did because you would be a sucker to pay full price for this."
5,Bette Midler's Cool Yule CD,I just love this CD. Bette Midler is truly a talented entertainer. Music is very swingy at times. Easy to listen to. I'll be buying more of her in the future.
5,BETTE I love YOU!,"She is a true entertainer, very few of them around these days. She has a wonderful voice and energy about her and does so many great Christmas/holiday tunes to enjoy and it always in my mox at Christmas time."
2,cool yule,"i have been a fan of bette for many, many years. i bought this cd in anticipation of yet another of her fine accomplishments. what a disappointment! i don't know what style the producers were going for on this cd, but it was completely flat. the christmas songs left much to be desired. and then to throw in a couple of past hits which had nothing to do with the season?don't waste your money. sorry bette, you can do much better than this."
1,Ho-ho-ho-hum,Bette is great on her Rosemary Clooney album but this Cristmas effort falls flat. Get the Anne Murray Christmas album; better music by far.
5,Bette Swings Christmas,Fabulous Bette... How wonderfully she joins traditional Christmas with her unique swing style...
5,Bette Midler's COOL YULE,"Bette's lst Christmas recording...GREAT!!If you like Bette, you must add this to yourcollection!! Also on recording, a specialrendition of ""From A Distance""."
3,Did Bette run out of Christmas songs?,"I love Bette Midler, but hey, 37 minutes is not very much music for your money! Many best-selling CD's play twice this."
5,Love Bette,"I have always loved Bette , but I don't know if she ever had a Christmas album, so when I heard about it on T V , I could not wait to buy it.No stores at the time had it, and I could barely wait.It arrived the day before Christmas, I almost missed the season for listening to Christmas music, and this was a year I truley needed some lifting up.THIS ALBUM WAS AWESOMETHANK YOU BETTE MIDLER"
3,Cool Yule-Bette Midler,"Fun CD, really enjoyed it. Would have liked it better if it had more upbeat songs on it."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS CD's EVER!!!,"I own a lot of Christmas music and this is one of the absolute best - not a bad song in the bunch! She is clearly having a blast on the ""fun"" songs - her duet with Johnny Mathis is adorable! The more somber songs and hymns are properly reverent and moving and her Christmas version of ""From a Distance"" will bring tears to your eyes... this is everything a Christmas cd should be! ENJOY!"
3,"ALMOST Totally ""Cool""","Normally, I give Bette a 5-star review for her CDs when they deserve it. I must admit that I don't think this one rates that high, despite what others here have said. (I'd give this 3 1/2 stars really, but I won't quibble over that half-a-star.)The album seems a little skimpy at 37 minutes and I think NOT recording ""Santa Baby"" is sort of unthinkable. I mean, HOW PERFECT A MIDLER SONG IS THAT?Still there are gems on this -- the duet with Mathis, the Hawaiian number (great fun) and the new Christmas version of ""From a Distance"" is inpired. It just won't be my favorite Christmas album -- but then again, it may grow on me."
2,Not Your Best Bette,"I've been a fan for years, and I thought (for some reason) that this would be the Bette of old that would add her fun quirky personality to some old classics. However, The Divine Miss M went with a more sophisticated approach. If you like that Bette then go for it, however, if you like the fun original Bette, opt out."
4,"If You like this album, You'll LOVE Breaking for the Holidays","If you like this album, you'll love ""Breaking for the Holidays""! New recordings of Classic Christmas songs with divas like Bette Midler, it has Chaka Khan, Sandra Bernhard and American Idol favorite Vonzell Solomon!Cool Yule & Breaking For the Holidays, two must haves!"
4,DeLonghi PAC210 Review,"Set-up took only 5 minutes in my attic bedroom. The exhaust tube/window sash adaptor was simple to install, but I would suggest you plan to supplement its temporary installation with some weather-stripping.This rolling unit is solid, and the controls are convenient and easy to operate. Adequately cooled a 90 degree room in about 2 hours and kept it comfortable afterwards. Adjustment of the thermostat is simple (twist a knob).I agree with another reviewer that the exhaust tube gets warm, but this is to be expected given the unit's mechanism of action. I don't see it as an issue.The enclosed instruction manual is sparse but covers the basics. Reads like a translation from Italian (which it is).The unit is also a little louder than I expected based on previous reviews, but I'm very pleased overall. It has made an unusable room very comfortable!"
3,So close to being so good!,"The chief reason I read this book is because Tobias Wolff offered praise for this writer. I found the writing and the pace wonderful. I felt the author sacrificed direct story telling for mood and ambiance especially at the end and this was really disappointing. For people who liked this book, I so strongly recommend Susanna Moore's IN THE CUT. Please read it. Talk about a satisfying, not run-of-the-mill mystery. Terrific. I will certainly read Mr. Griner's earlier collection of short stories and keep an eye open for any new books, but I really hope he is not one who thinks that satisfying a reader's baser instincts is beneath the job of a writer."
1,"Worst GPS ever, stay away from it!!!!!","I got this GPS for $325 in November 2006. First few weeks were a nightmare.Upgrading from version 3.06 to 3.11 took about two months. This GPS is really a piece of work. Maps are very old - maybe 5-6 years. Always getting the message ""searching for route"" . You have to keep moving to get any directions. When you stand still it doesn't respond. Last problems I had when I missed my flight / vacation because this Teletype's GPS was giving me the opposite directions few times in NYC/ New Jersey area.Don't buy it, don't waste your time and money. I have MIO C310 - much better GPS for half the price of this junk."
1,Piece of junk.,"This is a rip off. All claims are BS. Short battery life. Software locks up. POI's must be on Neptune cause there not from around here. The video display reminds me of Atairi Pong from the 60's. This thing is more lost than the 3 blind mice. I used a friend's Garmin Street Pilot on a long trip and it performed like a dream, very very useful. Don't be like me, listen to my friend and buy a Garmin or other well known brand."
1,Worthless,"Tele Type WorldNav 3100 Deluxe GPS is not beneficial GPS for the navigation because it doesnot provide the basic services such as Transportation like Taxis, Amtrak, Recreation, etc. So I can rate this product 0000000000000."
1,One Star for Packaging and 0 for the rest,"WorldNav 3100 Delux couldn't find my town on the map and they blamed Google maps, said my town was too small. I looked up my town on Google and Google had my town and all the street names. Having used a Garmin 350 for a couple of days I had realistic expectations. It's unfortunate WorldNav put their money into packaging and too little into development. How can they stay afloat selling a product that performs so badly? Twenty bucks wasted on postage not to mention my disappointment and time trying to make it work. Guess I'll bite the bullet and buy a Garmin 350."
4,Good value for money,"I bought the unit directly from teletype for $250 (special promotion). While waiting for delivery I read the horror stories about it on various forums. TT tech deserves 5 stars for fixing the problems in a few days. When I got the unit, I updated it with latest firmware and it works great! I wish the screen size was 5"" and not 3.5"" but that's not possible at this time for this price range. It would put the unit in $800 range.MP3 and Nav work great. I don't plan to use picture viewer or movie viewer feature on this.Why not 5 stars......the maps are older. It does not have the freeways built in last one year. I know it's not really TTs problem. This is what they got from TeleAtlas. But as a customer I have a problem with this.Overall highly recommended unit."
5,A JOURNEY WITHIN (peaceful existence),"I title this review a peaceful existence because I played this cd while on a stressful hurried car trip to work(morning rush hour)...much stress...and aggravation with the people on the road and the total lack of road manners here in New York. I found that playing this tape soothed my anxious spirit and made me more tolerable of the other drivers on the road. I loved the tape so much, I took an alternate route to work, less traveled and a little longer...but I was able to hear more of the tape. The feeling lasted well into the morning and I felt more tolerant, friendly and helpful to those around me. Thank you! You may have saved my blood pressure and heart alot of stress...not to mention the people around me. Thank you.....this tape is an audio-PROZAC."
3,3D photography of sex,"I bought this book out of curiosity. The photography was 3D (using glasses) and was good 3D. It may be the first guide to 3D sex but ""truly sensational"" overstates the sex aspect. Additionally the 3D effect was compromised by some of the photos covering two pages making it difficult to get the full 3D effect due to the binding of the book. I am somewhat disappointed in the book."
5,One of my favorites,"Swerve is an album I have kept coming back to over the years and never been disappointed. Howe Gleb manages to create some desert ether with his garage band, Giant Sand. Beyond the two crazy bridges, this is a great collection of songs that become a unified composition. The upbeat Can't Find Love is great opener. My favorites are ballads Trickle Down System and Former(Not ""Forever"", as noted above) Version of Ourselves. Howe Gleb does a wonderful desert drenched version of Bob Dylan's Every Grain of Sand that's down right moving! Unfortunely, the creative bent of Howe Gleb has led to some hits and misses over the years: you can pass on Rant, but Swerve is a true masterpiece."
5,The Folk Remedy Encyclopedia,This was a gift for my mother. She uses the book daily for helpful tips for the entire family. I recommend this book to anyone that believes in old folk remedies.
3,Monopoly 2( Jewel case),The pkg. was damaged so I never got a chance to play it .I sent it back. they never sent me another one I guess I got the last one.
5,Nick at Nite?,"Upon reading her poem Nick at Nite, you will understand just why I like Ms. Duhamel's work. It's crass, frank, funny, and altogether moving. The only question I would pose her if I did have the chance is whether her play on the words Nick at Nite was intentional or not. Either way if you enjoy witty poems with a bit of sentimentality to it this book is for you."
1,Poetry?,"I could barely get through the book. Duhamel's philosophy seems to be ""first word, best word."" The poems are without rhythm; no attention has been paid to sound. The poems are simplistic, predictable, and contain subject matter that has been written about by many other poets with greater success. Sadly, the poems, for the most part, are without heart and do not reach for the universal--they are self-indulgent and boring."
4,Still fresh,I used to play in the SD music scene with John Lee (aka Aminature). he even did a one month stint in my own band. John write with originality and verve and keeps his musical chops sharp and clean.This is still the best thing they ever did.
5,Great coverage!,I can't say enough good things about this concealer. I actually wonder why it took me so long to give it a try. It matches my skin tone and makes my skin look flawless. It glides on smoothly and doesn't rub off. I love all of shiseido products and this one is a must have!
5,The Absolute Best!,"Seemed like a bit much for a ""Can Caddy"" but worth every penny. I read a review by someone else who tested this item's ability to keep beverages cold and tried it myself there was no comparison between this and anything else I've ever seen or used. Buy it NOW!"
2,Thermos can insulator,"The supplier did write that 'styles may vary', and it did. It is not a genuine Thermos product but likely a fake, sold as if it is a Thermos product. Its silicon black ring around the neck is very thick and inconvenient to drink from, and not what is shown in the picture. I wish they had told that suppliers/manufacturer may vary, instead of 'styles may vary'. I had a genuine Thermos p2700 can holder, which is much more convenient and better quality."
2,Not worth the cost.,"Works best if thermos is chilled before use. But even then, may keep inserted can and contents cool for longer than usual, but not sufficiently so."
5,So Much Better Than Those Cheap Foam Ones,"What's not to like? This is well made, attractive, and keeps a can cold for hours. The rubber ring on top for a grip is a nice addition. Well worth the money, tho a bit expensive for an item that cost about a dollar to make in China."
4,"Clean lines, does keep can coldish after an hour","I've been using the Fridge cozy which is bulky but until the gel thaws the can stays very very cold, even on the beach. In time the Fridge peels and looks terrible at least now I do not look like a homeless person trying to keep a can cool. I found the Thermos only worked about an hour to an hour and 1/2 which for most people I bet would be fine. I have a drink with me at all times so I was hoping for a little longer. Today I'm trying it out of the freezer but since there is no gel or anything to hold the cold I'm not sure it will make that much of a difference. THe top to me is just like a tire and feels good while holding it. It fits in cup holders, keeps the can colder than it would on its on and looks a lot better than what I was using, so I like it. Since it's not much bigger than the can I am worried I may accidently throw it away one day. I'm going to get another one and try to get another Fridge for the beach."
5,Great product.,"It looks clean, professional and does a great job keeping my drink cool! What more can you ask for. Recommended to all that like a cold beverage but can't drink it all at once."
5,Thermos stainless steel can insulator,I was impressed with this when I bought this can cooler. I am even more impressed now after using this product. It does keep your cans cooler longer than the regular can insulators. It is very light weight and easy to carry and to hold on too. The outside does not get cool so your hands never feel the cool. I have even thought about ordering more just to have around for others when at my house. Well worth the price.
5,Worth it!,"I was hesitant to shell out the cash, but I'm happy I did. They work, and you can tell there is a difference. I think that these will last forever. I ordered two and they were at my door the next day. Very satisfied!"
5,Best can cooler ever!!!!,I was looking for a new way to keep my cans cool to take to work/for home. When I take it to work I hate coming to take a sip out of a warm soda. My job is busy and constantly has me running around so when I get a chance to take a drink I do. This product is absoluately amazing! It is a bit pricey but it's worth every penny! I took a sip out of my soda in this thermos an hour after opening it and it was like I had just taken it out of the fridge! I have to have a soda in there longer but I'm sure that will come up soon. I highly recommend this product!!
5,excellent choice,I am very pleased with the quality of the product selected. is of the articles that I liked and I will come to order
4,Love it,"This is the best coozie ever!!! A soda can fits nice and snug but, the beer cans are loose. It does keep the can colder for longer than the rest!! I will be purchasing these for friends in the future!!"
4,Scientific review.,"I received my Thermos insulator and I thought I'd try a scientific test in evaluating it's effectiveness. I used two cold cans of soda, one with the insulator and one without and tested them over a 3 hour period in a 78 degree room. I took the temps using a Thermapen device, an accurate cooking thermometer. The can WITH the insulator started at 35 degrees and after the 3 hours, gained exactly 20 degrees, while the can WITHOUT the insulator started at 35 degrees and gained 36 degrees. The performance wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, but is still exceptable in keeping it cooler. Definitely better than drinking soda at room temperature. Oh, I ended up using paint thinner/mineral spirits (and elbow grease) to clean the nasty gummy goo off after taking the label off."
5,Back to buy another,"We bought two of these on a spur of the moment whim at a office supply store several years ago. We use them at work and home, but sometimes we forget and leave them. I am ordering two more so that we have one everywhere. They are simply amazing at keeping a soda cold. They are strong stainless steel. There is a small plastic disk on the bottom that has came off of mine the last time I drooped it. The rubber around the top slips off for easy cleaning. For all the abuse it has taken it has held up well. This can insulator will ad class to your can of soda unlike the foam things."
5,Very Classy Beer Cozy,"I have bought and given out over a dozen of these units.Way better than fat non-metallic foam pieces of s#&t.; The secret is that design provides ""isolation"" between hand and container, greatly reducing the heat transfer from your hand into your cold drink. The beverage can contacts the unit only at the rubber rim at the top and one or two small contact points on the bottom. Stainless steel thermal conductivity (16.3 W/m K) is lower (better for this function) than carbon steel (51.9 W/m K.Practical results of this design are:The cozy does not chill your hand while carrying a cold beer.Smaller diameter fits comfortably in hand.The stainless steel looks great after over a year of frequent use.Design allows to you to drink beer at a lower rate since you are not trying to finish prior the beer warming up."
3,Not all 12oz cans are created equally!,"The Good:I really wanted to like this product, and at first I did. 1. It looks cool. 2. The brushed metal doens't pick up fingerprints. 3. It fits nicely into my cup holder of my car. 4. As the other reviews state it really does keep your product cold, if that is your product is a soda.The Bad:So far the couple of different beer cans that I have tried to use with this have been slightly too small so they rattle around inside the insulator and you don't have the superior vacuum insulation effect as with the with soda (and no, i don't drink beer in my car!).I probably wouldn't have bought this product if I knew that to begin with."
5,It really works!!!,"These can insulators really do the job. We have had them now for a couple of months, and they really do keep things very cold for extended periods of time. A great product"
5,Awesome,"Really does the job well of keeping a drink cold.Doesn't do to well if left in direct sunlight though, but no biggie."
5,Can cooler works great.,"This is a great looking Thermos, can cooler. My husband uses it for soda at work, mostly in the summertime.It looks very sleek and really keeps a cold beverage, cold....longer than if it was not in anything.Worth the price and works much better than the foam type can cooler."
5,ALERT - NOT a pack of 4 - individually sold,"Denso 5344 Spark Plug (Pack of 4) Amazon delivered as a single plug, rolling around loose in the package with a slightly crushed box. I saw it said 4 pack, needed 4, and got 1. These look like good plugs, but I can't review the plug itself, just warning buyers that you will not get what you pay for.If I get all 4 I'll happily update. First time I've been screwed by Amazon :(UPDATE: Finally got 4 plugs (still no joy for the pack of 4 description) and got then installed into an '09 WRX which was a feat in itself. The engine runs more smoothly and I've had no issues at all with fitment. They were gapped correctly right from the box.Do yourself a favor and take the driver's side plugs out from underneath the car and save yourself the headache of removing ducts and batteries. It takes about 2 hours to do all 4. Be patient and torque to 15 ft/lbs (10 if you use anti-seize)"
3,SHIRLEY YOU JEST,"Before THE EXORCIST there was Joel Delaney. Steeped in early 70s psychedelia, this meandering tale features an unexpected Shirley MacLaine as a snooty New Yorker whose hippie brother Perry King (in his film debut) starts exhibiting bizarre violent behavior.The movie examines clashing cultures prevalent then and features a controversial climax featuring Shirley's 13 year old son.Both MacLaine and King are eerily effective and while nowhere as terrifying as THE EXORCIST there are some disturbing moments."
2,"Reviewing the story, not the format","I had read this book when it was originally published many years ago and quite enjoyed it. Just recently rented the DVD and was not too happy with it, even though it does stick pretty closely to the original storyline.As I recall, the main character was more sympathetic and likeable than as played by Shirley MacLaine. The book also did a much better job of explaining how Joel became possessed. But the main problem with this movie is the last third or so. The abuse of the children was stomach-turning and much more extreme and dragged-out than I remembered in the book. I almost felt as if I were watching child pornography. Or perhaps reading about this part did not make as big an impact as seeing it acted out. As far as the ending, that is totally, totally different.Read the book, instead!"
5,Who does not like Shirley M. Films?,"Shirley is great to watch in this dated but fun to watch movie, She's great! I love films from this era and it's a different world so that also makes it fun to watch."
1,get them someplace else,I ordered this a long time ago and I'm still waiting. I was told it would take 2 weeks. It's been over 4 months.
3,this is not worth the money,"Johnny Thunders being recorded is excellent. Actually attending a Thunders show was riveting. Listening to one of these horrible sounding bootlegs is ridiculous.Because he was such an enigma, record companies with normal equipment did not officially record his shows. I believe that most of these recordings are just recycled bootlegs from the cassettes that have been floating around for almost three decades.Great songs here but very frustrating to listen to.I guess the response to that would be that these recordings are the only documentation of his live work. As a consumer, it is frustrating to listen to these second rate recordings on today's digital technology"
2,Old School Economics,"This book is not that useful. The English tips and hints are not clear or specific. Rather, the author makes general comments; too general to be useful in practice. Moreover, there is nothing to do with Economics. The Economics the author (rarely) mentions is the Economics people used to study decades ago. There are quite a few better books around. Don't buy this one."
3,Bleh,"As interesting as Deirdre McCloskey's work is, it's about as exciting as the title ""Economical Writing"" sounds. McCloskey certainly has a certain style about her writing with my favorite part of her writing when she assured us that the person that said ""Tell them what you are going to say. Say it. And then tell them what you said"" is currently burning in hell."
4,Practical information,The book provides good guidance and practical information. It is a good acquisition if you are interested in writing documents in this field.
2,Ho Hum,"If I remember correctly, this was put together after Jimi's death. I'd take the time to look it up but I just listened to it and I'm now so bored and depressed that I simply can't bother. So the formula is like this: dredge up some old studio stuff of Jimi jamming a mellow groove, then let some dude rap over the top of it, saying his own name ad nauseum in some sort of drooling self-tribute. What a waste. Probably enough to make Jimi hurl."
2,"wow, I didn't know that about bigfoot...","A few things this movie taught me:- the wolf is Bigfoot's only known traveling companion- Mountain goats commit ritual suicide by eating cement- There are no remains of dead Bigfoots because the dead are carried thousands of miles to be dumped into glaciers.- dying people can channel mental messages from Bigfoot- if you die in the arctic, Bigfoot will find your body and carry it to the nearest townThis film is overly long, usually boring, but occasionally very amusing."
2,not my cup of tea,"Sabrina Jeffries is an automatic buy for me, but I should have passed on this one. I really didn't like it and ended up skimming most of it. I didn't care for Christabel. Never warmed up to her and that is the kiss of death for a romance novel. If you don't care about the characters, the book isn't going to work. I haven't been real wild about this whole Royal Brotherhood Series. I'm anxious for her to get back to something else. Hopefully, it will be more like her earlier works. This one is a stinker."
3,A book with a twist of whist.,"I really like s. Jeffries' books. I'm never blown away by her storyline because it's always the same, but her prose is beautiful, and that's a lot to ask in this day and age...This book was fun to read because it focuses on the game of whist and its clever moves. It added spice to an otherwise predictable and somewhat kitchy love story."
4,a shrew blossoms into a swan,"Of the three heroes of the Royal Brotherhood series, Bryne was my least favorite. He was always businesslike and unemotional. But when he finally gets his own book, sparring with the heroine brings him out of himself. He turns out to be a tough talking wisecracker who is actually marshmellow inside with a need to help the helpless. The heroine starts out as an irritatingly helpless ugly duckling but develops into a swan who can take charge of her own life and help Bryne out in the process. The aggravating couple at the beginning of the book turn into an engaging team by the end."
4,Pretty Good,I have read this book over and over again because I find it so interesting. But I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because after I read it once there were some parts I skipped over. I have read the other books in the series and enjoyed this one the most. I would definitely recommend this!
4,Excellent review of a complex game.,"Brady is known for being informative without revealing the excitement behind each game. For Perfect Dark, expect no less. This guide is much more entertaining to use than Prima's as it leaves much more for the imagination. Consider it; don't let the mere page numbers of other guides dissuade you from purchasing this excellent ""hint"" (not give-away) book."
1,Didn't work and hard to return,"The company was nice enough to send two of these, but neither one worked on my laptop. They both had strange effect on the charging and the mouse pad. When I asked for a way to return, they basically said to just send it back. Of course they didn't provide any funds to do that. Finally they sent me a postage paid pdf. I wouldn't do this again and I still need an adapter for my laptop. Hopefully I will receive my money back."
4,Factual and nicely produced,"This is a factual review of Joey Dunlop's career. It is a very nicely produced hard back with great photos. It is probably a must for any Joey Dunlop fan. However, it is not anywhere near as absorbing or personal as ""Joey Dunlop, A Tribute"" by author and TT winner Ray Knight. Now that is a fabulous book!!!!You cannot get it on Amazon yet 9/2002, but you can get it at [URL]Keep the shiny side up!"
4,Great book for reading to your kids before bedtime.,"This is a wonderful little book for reading to your children. It has a simple premise of building the story. Each page adds a new line, with a key word represented by a picture. Once they learn what each picture stands for, you will find that your kids will be able to recite the entire sentence. The topic of the book is the Christmas story, but we read it all year round."
2,Look elsewhere,"This feels like a made for TV broadcast that was never intended to be released on DVD. Then was. I think this would appeal to newscast buffs more than natural disaster buffs as this is a great exercise in newscasting, but offers little in the way of doing the tsunami justice. The DVD picture quality is low-medium (okay, but could be substantially better). Taking this DVD, as a whole, into consideration spending any more time than they did in order to achieve a better picture quality would not have been worth it. If you love newscasting for the sake of newscasting then this pretty good (not great), but if you're looking for a tsunami (or natural disaster) documentary look elsewhere."
2,Not contemporary,"If you were looking for any footage of the Indonesian Tsunami, you need to keep looking. This is not up to National Geographic standards. 99% of the footage is old 8mm stuff. I am surprised that my Farudja circuits didn't barf. Informative, especially if the projector is off."
4,a good movie,"i enjoy this movie. charlie brown, linus, peperment patty, marcie, snoopy and woodstock are chosin as exchange students and head off to france. in france they find love mystery and fun. a good movie. you should also really see the sequal to this movie. it's called ""what have we learned, charlie brown"""
4,"I love this movie, just wish they would put it out on dvd for a good price.",This movie brings back sweet memories. I just love all the Peanuts movies but this one is very special. It reminds me of the trip I took my Senior year to Paris and the surrounding countryside.
4,Peanuts take a trip,"I would really love for the goofy studio who controls the rights to this film to once and for all release it on DVD like the fans have demanded!Personally, I loved this movie. Very typical Peanuts adventure and quite well animated in my opinion. Obviously, this was Charles Schulz's ""trip down memory lane"" as his beloved characters journey to a small town in France as exchange students. Along their journey, they experience sites and sounds of WWII including some of the music from the Hit Parade of the time, as heard by Snoopy and Woodstock while they drown their sorrows in glasses of (root)beer served on tap at the local French ""Cafe du Sports.""The theme music was also quite haunting and memorable. I used to own this movie in VHS until the tape got damaged. I'd love to be able to see it on DVD!"
5,BEST CHARLIE BROWN MOVIE YOU'LL COME ACROSS,"When you think of Charlie Brown movies, you think of the Christmas Special or the Pumpkin King short films. There are also those often cheaply produced full-length films that were probably made for television as were the holiday vareity. However, ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"" outclasses any other Chalie Brown movie you will come across. The plot is well scripted, the music is awesome, and the animation precise. Just from viewing this piece you can tell a sizeable amount of time and energy went into this film to make it as good as it is. The jokes are funny (unlike many Peanuts films), and the gang's adventure to France is riveting. Is is truely a shame that Paramount has still not released this classic film out on DVD."
5,What a find!,"When you are a little kid, you are in the movie .This movie was so intriguing because there were no other people but the gang. It was very scary and I think this will capture the imagination of everyone. I love that they are like adults as children. I felt as if I was seeing a naughty pleasure but somehow managed to be ok. It still sticks to me like my first mystery favorite. The Rum and coca cola song playing on the jukebox during snoopy's drunken scene is a great part of movie comedy!! What a great movie! You and your kids are going to France!"
5,The best Peanuts movie ever!!!!,"I love this Peanuts movie. In fact it is the only one I really enjoy. I mean sure there's adults but there in France there has to be more than just the kids. The comeback What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown was OK but not as good as the movie. Great movie and I think anyone who loves Peanuts should watch this movie. A+ all the way."
1,"Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown","Box that had the vhs, was ripped. The label fell off, when I opened the package, and tape wasn't even rewound! I'm not a happy customer. This is a gift for a collector. I would return it, but it's too close to Christmas to order another one, it wouldn't make it on time. This was NOT a cheap item."
1,"The worst ""Peanuts"" movie","I'm sorry, despite the fun of watching Snoopy play tennis at Wimbledon, this one just doesn't cut it. They mystery plot is plodding, the kids are horribly out of their element in the run-down French chateau, and the entire story isn't very amusing at all. Worst of all, the grownups talk! Baffling as the ""womp whomp waaaa..."" speech by teachers and parents were to me as a child, as a grownup myself I realize that was a major part of the charm of the original cartoons. It really spoils this one. Bon Voyage Charlie Brown (And Don't Come Back) strives for the emotional poignancy of Snoopy Come Home, but falls far, far short of that masterpiece from a decade earlier."
5,An oral history collecting the testimonies of the Sixth Marine Division in their own words,"Stay Off The Skyline: The Sixth Marine Division On Okinawa is an oral history collecting the testimonies of the Sixth Marine Division in their own words. The Sixth Marine Division was formed of battle-tested veterans and fought its only action on the island of Okinawa from April to June 1945, capturing most of the ground in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. A gripping compilation that immerses the reader in the experiences of those who laid their lives on the line for their country, Stay Off The Skyline is a primary source enthusiastically recommended for lay readers and military historians alike."
4,good title,"my kind of book, a comment i heard often in korea. love any book about the marines and their exploits"
5,Pretty Platter!,"I purchased this small oval platter simply because I needed a platter to coordinate with my other Pistoulet pieces. I worried it might be a little plain. But when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. The colors are very rich and deep and it has a very nice glossy finish. It is just a very classy piece and a ""must have""!"
5,Same as OEM - half the price,"I've used these a couple times on my 328i and will continue because they're 1/2 what the ""steal""er, I mean dealer charges. These are genuine OEM. Enjoy!"
5,Best OEM Replacement,"If you want to use OEM parts on your BMW but do not want to pay OEM prices, then this is the perfect oil filter for you. It is the exact same Oil filter you would get at the BMW dealership. The only difference is that this oil filter is half the price."
1,Does not fit 1997 BMW Z3 1.9L,"I just wanted to let others know that even though the ""Will it fit"" form says it will fit this model, it does not."
1,Poor Service! BUY FROM DEALER INSTEAD!,I purchased THIS OIL FILTER for my BMW and never looked at it till I got ready to do my oil change at the Computer Suggested Mileage. Then I found out it was the wrong size after I had emptied my oil and thrown out the old filter. I had to hitch a ride to the dealer to buy a CORRECT ONE MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN!When I tried to return it they flatly refused! Adding insult to injury they won't even grant full credit on an exchange ON AN ITEM NEVER OPENED! WAOW! That makes poor customer service! I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THEM OR AMAZON AGAIN!!! RUN!!NOW I HAVE TO THROW THIS AWAY! IT HAS COST ME MORE THAN 2X DEALER'S PRICE!!!
5,Mann Filter BMW E39 (2002),Product fit and worked as advertised. Mann filters reputation is excellent. Amazons delivery of the order arrived before their ETA which is a hughe plus.
5,Great Filters,Thanks for such a great deal on these filters. Hard to find filters at my finger tips at Amazon!
1,Doesn't fit,This filter is too big to fit 2006 Z4 3.0i. Found out after draining the oil :(Ran to the autoparts store and picked up the correct filter (STP brand) which was good because it was well made with good pleats and silicone seals between the ends.
3,They only got better,Noisier than later albums. Sort of has the feel of a practice session where they just happened to have the tape running. Definitely not one of their strongest.
3,lazy but still worth it,"I agree just stick Elevator Music on constant repeat and you will be glad you brought this one. Some of the other stuff should of been taken further the critics seem right when they call it lazy, but maybe Howe didn't want to loose the spontaneousness of it all, they seem to have released a lot of material round this time. Worth a listen if your a fan."
5,AWESOME product!,"This is well made, durable, cute, fun, and kid friendly. Our daughter loves to carry about her baby dolls and stuffed animals-still at 7! This is a great product. I would definitely recommend it."
1,great film but the dvds are damaged,i got this dvd new from amazon when it arrived i checked the surface as i do with all dvds and the surface was scratched and scuffed up and far from new mint condition that should be expected when buying a new item so i requested a replacement from amazon was sent another copy and it was far worst than the first so i sent both back ordered it again and still damaged. dont get me wrong this film is 5 stars all the way but consider yourself to be purchasing an x rental condition dvd because thats what you will likely get unless your one of the fortunate few who get a disc that wasnt handled abusively by the manufacturer buyer beware
2,Southampton Insurrection,"This is like a xeroxed copy of book. Many pages are very blurry, and the pictures are printed very lightly. In fact some are too light to distinquish detail. Also, in my copy the map of Southampton County was missing...very disappointing. Printing from my own printer was clearer than this book. You get what you pay for..."
5,My daddy!,This is my Daddys album. He gave me a free and sigened by him cd! I listened to all the songs. Its a great album!
2,Slipping in quality?,"I bought one of these to replace one we have had for more than ten years that had some wear spots on the surface (after a lot of use). I would have given that one 5 stars. But, this one isn't the same. It looks the same, but it doesn't heat consistently or evenly. It gets much hotter where the coil is located and the cycle between reheating and turning off is more extreme, so you never know what you are going to get. The local hot spots are so bad I rarely use it now."
1,Misrepresented product; won't buy from this seller,"They had a picture of a nonstick grill altho the written description in small print did say aluminium grill. I thought I was buying a nonstick grill and ended up paying unnecessarily for postage both ways (13/- just for return shipping). They did refund just my purchase price, but I hadn't even opened the box (as the picture on it showed it wasn't a nonstick grill.) I will never buy from them again."
1,don't waste your money,"This looked like fun, but we absolutely couldn't get it to work. It seemed to be for an older operating system, kept shutting down, etc. Finally it was thrown in the trash."
2,Oh what should have been...,Ever watch a movie and feel that there was a good movie in there somewhere and they just missed it? This is one of those... Can't blame Coogan or Duff or Thirlby though... Oh well...
5,Excellent film...Hilary Duff is the greatest!,"What Goes Up is a film that far exceeded my expectations for any new upcoming Hilary Duff films. She beautifully plays a character that seems to be searching for something to fill a gap that has been placed in her life by the death of someone she and her friends loved and worshipped. This movie seems to leave the Hollywood mold behind (very thankfully!) and shows us just how realistic life is, and how it's not perfect at all like most movies would try to make it seem. The other actors are fantastic as well, especially Olivia Thirlby and Steve Coogan.This movie is highly recommended and I really loved it. Very fantastic film for our times."
1,WhAt GoEs Up TuRnS To TrAsH,"Honestly this should have re-edited and made into satire - it really has all the hallmarks. Kooky isn't comedy if you're just baffled, and we were.Pretentious and so divorced from any sense of self it's Emo on Acid sensibilities may suit a number of people but we couldn't see the point at all.The plot about a reporter whose life is on the skids, and goes to visit New Hampshire only to find more disasters waiting for him at the school he's visiting, is very weak. the characters are entirely one dimensional and the whole film takes forever to say or do anything.Someone out there will love this - it will hit a chord with someone - but Steve Coogan used to make parodies of this sort of clap trap and really it tries way too hard to a cool oddity and we were just left bemused and bored - sorry."
1,What was the purpose to this movie?,"Muted and never moving, instead finding no insight while dragging its feet along a variety of forced quirks. This movie really struggles to find its voice and to find purpose and meaning"
2,Very ultra-traditionalist,"It's basically a good book if you like traditionalist fantasy. But I give it only two stars because the characters seem more like archetypes than real flesh and blood people (The Wizard, The Chancellor, The King, The Lady in Distress, etc.) For a good read for me, the book would've had to have at least one good and decent Chancellor, and at least one bad and greedy Hand ;-)"
2,For juvenile readers only,"In my early teens I devoured the Hardy Boys series. Recently I reread one of them : how simple and predictable it was! So too with this story. Likely it will appeal to those on a seventh grade reading level, where descriptive writing, basic character development, a creative plot, and an attentive editor's red pen are secondary to simple action. The writer seems to have just plowed along with his tale, and whenever he ran into an intractable situation he'd just pull out another Deus Ex Machina to resolve matters. I mean, who put that first saddle on Esteron?If improbable happenstance jars you, avoid this book. If you're uncritical in your reading and like your fantasies quick and easy, enjoy!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeaasts, win. Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeaasts, win. Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeasts, win. Fight the nightbeaasts, win.Get the idea? Perhaps a little too trite. Look elsewhere."
2,Cheap construction,Came in well packaged. But quality of the aluminum is cheap. This clipboard is made in China and it shows. The nickel plating on the clip just flakes off immediately after opening. I dont this clipboard wil last me very long. The aluminium appears to be powder coated. The clip to hold the papers doesn't look like its gonna make it too long. Very cheap product. Worth about 2-3 bucks.
4,satisfied,"I needed a clipboard that could store papers I needed easy and portable access to and this is what I bought. It wasn't as solid as I thought it would be, but that doesn't mean it's not strong. I thought it'd be heavy, but it's lightweight and has held up so far. I love having a place to keep paperwork that isn't ready for the filing cabinet but isn't front page priority either. I often toss my phone, gum and other stuff in there to free my hands up when going to a clients home. I'm certainly satisfied with this"
4,Good clipboard,I bought this to use on my field trips and business outings and it has held up well to outside abuse.PROS:- Large storage compartment- Securely snaps shut- Great build quality (it is tough)- Light weight and easy to carryCONS:- Price seems a bit steep- In extreme cold or heat it can be uncomfortable to hold (I needed gloves)Overall it was a good investment and will last a long time.
3,Aluminum Form Holder,"This is a nice holder. I brought a similar one many years ago, that one is starting to show its age. I am a teacher, and trying to keep the tidal waves of paper is a neverending task. I like the idea of having a way to hold papers within a clipboard case, especially when I need to do individual assessments for about 20 students. I like the style of this form holder. Clipboard for the top of the case, pen/pencil case within the box. I also like that it is made of metal, not plastic. In the pass, I have cracked, chipped, or broken plastic(or fiber) clipboards. The negatives are the thin aluminum case, I don't think it will last nearly as long as the previous case (which is made of a heavier aluminum). I also think the 1-inch deep case might be a bit too large and clunky to carry around (only time will tell). My previous aluminum case was about 1/2 inch (slim). Finally, the latch which holds the lid in place does not look like it will last too long. Again, only time will tell."
2,Cheap and Sharp!!,"I read the reviews of similar products and decided that this one was the best of the worst. I am not impressed, it is generally cheap and I got a cut on my forearm while walking on a construction site which is why I bought it. I have since bought a clipboard for $1.99 and use a rubber-band to keep the forms from blowing in the wind. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Another thing that bothers me is that the clip damages the top of the papers because it is serrated like a kitchen knife."
2,cheap AND expensive,This board is thin and cheaply made. It also has sharp corners that can cut your hands when reaching in to it. Don't buy this thing....
3,Why so much??? Buyers remorse...,"Item shipped very quickly and was received without damage, but what concerned me was why the price of this item...it's almost $30 !!! It's just your average aluminum clipboard. I've owned many of these in the past and I don't ever remember spending over $20 for any of them... I go through one of these about every six months as they ride in my service truck and are exposed to quite a bit of abuse. So, my mind set was you get what you pay for? Not this time. This is of very low quality, very flimsy, and probably the cheapest model to date. I really don't see this lasting very long at all. My bad!!!"
4,naz still rockin after all these years,"definative history of one of the best underrated rock n roll machines to come along in the past 30+ years...great history and liner notes from 2 of the original band members, and even a ""family tree"" of how the band started and progressed thru the years and oh yes the music! all tracks are live, avd even some twice to show the band's many changes. a few, tho are in <horrors>mono! but dont let that stop you from immersing yourself in great rock n roll as you know it should be!"
1,Oops -- Honan's Errors,"I found 23 factual errors in Honan's book -- when I mentioned this to someone I was told that a reader in Virginia had found 142. There are much better biographies of Jane Austen out there -- for starters, no one has yet surpassed Elizabeth Jenkins', first published in the 1930s, and a fine recent one, a good introduction to JA's life, is Maggie Lane's latest, Jane Austen's World. Don't be put off by the fact that it is slick and, as they say, richly illustrated -- it's readable, sound and remarkably complete despite its size."
5,Konitz/Evans,"This is the first of two CD's with Lee Konitz and Gil Evans together. Although Evans is well-known as a composer and orchestra director his way of playing piano is unusual and surprising. His technic is unsophisticated but incisive. Like Monk or Mingus on piano he isn't equal or similar to anybody.Konitz as usual is performing at his best, never boring and always exiting.Well worth the buying as well as #2"
3,"Fun While it Lasted, but it Didn't Last Long","My oldest son received this gift for Christmas. We have a pool and we were all eager to get this toy out and try it out. It was so much fun while it lasted. The hover craft is fun to steer over the water and, while it takes practice to steer, it's not difficult. But, within a month water got into the battery compartment and the toy died."
1,no endurance and terrible english,"The hovercrafts battery only lasts about 20 minutes, the hovercraft does not work on land,and it died right in the middle of a boat race. The remote control looked used out of the box and this may be the worst toy I have ever purchased. In addition, I'd love to share my favorite quotes of terrible english from the box- Yes, these are true!!!1) ""Flat-out most, Let me passing through the fine time with you""2) ""Warning: Please don't place in the following place.a) nearby strong vibrationb) in the dusty play""3) "" Do not help yourselres to match a charger""Does this sound like a quality product to you???"
5,RC Twin Engine Hovercraft Boat,We are really pleased with the customer service we received from this company. They have been great about working with us until we were satisfied with the what we ordered. It has been great and I'd buy from them anytime.
5,Great age appropriate family movie!,"I bought this and other Herbie movies because I am tired of my son watching movies that are beyond him in age. Herbie is great, there are no swears, and everyone in the family can watch them and laugh. I don't have to worry about my son seeing things his brain isn't ready to process, and it's not as annoying as Nick or Disney Channels!"
2,weak,"I have read Fr. Dietzen's Q&A column in my diocesan paper for years. There is something rather weak and unsatisfactory about it. One cannot say that he is unorthodox exactly. Rather, there is something half-hearted in his presentation of the more controversial teachings of the Church. One gets the impression that he is uncomfortable answering certain questions. He also leaves a lot unsaid that really needs to be said. Mediocre is the word for it."
5,Great book a must read,"I have the hard copy version of this book it is a fantastic book that is a must read, if you like poems, heart felt sentiments and raw emotions you will love this book.Be prepared to go on an emotional journey with the author as he tells his story of challenges and triumphs."
4,"Aha... Okay, I get this","A real thought provoking book on enlightenment - as usual Hillig gets to the point in a very unusal, simple method that is both surprising and entertaining. No long drawn out explanations, just to the point and in your face..."
1,Not the book to buy,"I ordered this book because of the title but boy was I disappointed. There are few words on a page and silly cartoon pictures. This book is a total waste of money. I could not read it. I could not understand the point of it. I am not a beginner at the enlightenment game. I actually am no longer searching to become enlightened but eager to help students on the path. As one who took the enlightenment game very seriously and bought many books from Amazon in the process, I highly recommend you start with a book by Adyashanti (#1) or Gangaji (#2) and don't waste your money on this book."
1,Don't bother.,"I hate to say it but this is a rather silly book, I can't believe anyone actually takes it seriously."
4,drifters,if you like the drifters then this is a must but he is not at his best. his best work is on those doo wop shows very good voice snd music sounds great.
4,An Evening with Charlie Thomas' Drifters,"This hour-long concert filmed in York, PA in 2005, features Thomas and his current Drifters group, Louis Bailey, Jermone Manning, and Stephen Brown, backed by their own band. Now in his early 70s, Thomas and his soulful tenor shine on the staples of their act, ""Up On The Roof"", ""When My Little Girl Is Smiling"", and ""Under The Boardwalk"", and some surprises, including ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"", ""Dance With Me"", ""I Count The Tears"", and powerful renditions of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"". If you've seen Charlie and his group in concert, or watched them on one of the PBS shows and wanted more- this DVD is an ideal selection. The sound and video are top notch throughout and- even better- the money from sales goes directly to the artists themselves. Charlie, who joined in 1958, and Ben E. King, are the only Drifters members to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who are still with us today."
4,An engineer's comments,"As one who had the pleasure to work with BV in the cool shade of Camden, I can't express what an omission it would be if your music collection did not include some of his music. Everyone mentions humor; I'm digging the stuff that's got a little emotion behind it, and that's most of the stuff. Ben would never want a 5-star rating on his work, I suspect, because that would mean a lot of gussy'n up, which he doesn't like to do. What I remember is not redoing vocals much, not adding bags & bags of reverb, using real instruments instead of synths, and a lot of tinkering with instruments other people ignore, such as acoustic bass, glockinspiel, and the occaisional hubcap. To all, I pass on a comment Ben shared with me once: ""If it's got more than 3 chords -- it's jazz!"""
5,The Best,The stick made picking up the rolled out lesfe so easy no matter how thin you rolled then or big.
1,This isn't what you're looking for,"This album only features material with vocalist Tony Martin.You probably want the 32-song ""Best of"" with 29 songs by Ozzy, two by Dio, and one by Ian Gillan.But if you're looking for Tony Martin - not that there's anything wrong with that - this is your album."
2,a little bit on the flimsy side,"I love the Seventh Generation diapers and ordered the wipes. they weren't real bad but they weren't great either. the box was a nightmare to open one handed and the wipes are a little bit flimsy, so I ended up using much more wipes than I did with the commercial brands. I went back on using commercial unscented wipes."
2,dry,i was excited to try a different type of wipes but it is too dry not like J&J. i didnt use the whole box for my boy
4,"A great book, if liked Bridget Jones you'll love this.","This is the perfect book for anyone who's ever had trouble getting off the first rung of the ""up and comming"" ladder. While the book never pretends to be anything more than a good beach read, the writting is witty enough that it aspires to much more. You will feel for the main character, wish you had her friends and by the end of the book My Perfect Manhattan will be your perfect Manhattan."
3,Chick Lit at its Finest,"Happiness Sold Separately is pure, unapologetic chick lit. There's not much depth to the story, and the main character is likable...if she weren't so stupid and pathetic. In college, she meets a good, dropdead gorgeous guy with real life goals who only has eyes for her. He pays attention to her at parties and, when offered his dream job in L.A., he wants her to come along, where he'll support her until she can find employment. She declines.Instead, she now she hangs with her two best friends in NYC, stuck in a deadend data entry job waiting for a man to ""rescue"" her. Um...hello! Didn't she already have that and pass it up?With that said, the book was pretty well-written. The story moves along pretty quickly and (spoiler alert!) has a typical Hollywood movie ending."
1,Buy A Better Book,"This is by far the worst book I've ever read in my college career. Throughout the entire book only two to three main examples are used. Many times the examples are not carried along through the text appropriately and the reader is referred back to previous pages with information that doesn't really help. And, I've found at least one instance where the reader is referred back to an example and then referred back yet again to a different page. Not good.I would give this book less than one star if I could."
1,shame on the Mackworth and Poole,I was a student of Dr. Poole's ( one of the co-authors ) at the University of British Columbia and was forced to use this textbook for two semesters. It is without doubt the worst textbook on any subject in Computer Science that I have ever read. The book is extremely vague and confusing on many important subjects. The book also uses unnecessarily complex wording to describe simple concepts .. at some times it is much like reading code.
1,man i was disappointed,this book [stinks]. i hate it. its a waste of money. i thought i would learn how to do a switch 720 540 flip to a backside noselide down a triple kinked handrail landing in a manual and going over to a trashcan and ollieing it while still in the manual in less that a month and ive been skating scince last week.
2,can't ollie...,"man, I don't know what the heck these guys were thinking. I've been in the scene since Powell-Peralta was a glimmer in their daddy's eye. I tried to do some of the tricks in here the way they described and ended up tearing two ligaments. These guys are dangerous! I gave the book two stars just because I liked the pictures. I tell you what, though... there was not nearly as much info. on the better features of helmets as I like to see. I can't get enough about HELMETS! Skate and create, but for the love of Christo, don't read this freakin' book."
5,Better than a Waterpik,"I used a Waterpik for about eight years but couldn't seem to make it enough of a priority with the hassle of setting it up every time. I switched to a portable Waterpik and didn't like not being able to adjust the pressure and having to refill about three times each time I used it. This HydroCare system is so much more convenient! I use it every day while I'm showering and I never have to worry about mess, filling and refilling, electrical/battery issues, etc. It's easy to adjust the pressure. My one and only complaint is that I'd like to buy extra heads for it and I'm having trouble finding them."
5,At last!,Too bad this is out of stock. I have always wanted an oral irrigator that I could use in the shower. The only sensible place to use one. I'm going to look for their web site or other location for this (even though Amazon is my favorite web shopping site).
3,Remix album.,"I am not a huge fan of remix albums, but to be fair and objective, I will try not to rant on my displeassure or remix material. Basicly, this isn't a great remix effort as far as remix albums go. Many of the songs are a total waste of time. Out of the entire 16 track album, I only found five tracks that I was impressed with. Most of the songs are just same ol' same ol' EBM remix stuff that is getting harder and harder to avoid these days. Track 15 is my favorite track on the album, track 4 is my least favorite. The only good EBM track on the album is Track 11 (Funker Vogt and Stephen Groth of Apop mix). Not the worst remix album I have ever heard, but certainly nothing to get excited about either."
3,It's ok.,"There is an original song on this album that features Stephen Groth of Apoptygma Berzerk. It's a decent track. The best remix tracks on the album are by Gothminister, In The Nursury, and Velvet Acid Christ. Keep in mind that this is a remix album of a really bad Mortiis album (The Grudge). The remix album is better, which is rarely the case. It's nothing to get crazy about, but if your a Mortiis fan or a DJ looking to juice up your set with something a little different, than you'll probably find what your looking for at least a couple times on this album. Personaly, I'm just hoping that the next Mortiis album is better than The Grudge, and hopefully he doesn't go soft on us...err, well considering he started in black metal, I guess he went soft a long time ago."
2,Useful but boring,"I'm using this course for a business class in ecommerce. It was the best book I could find at the time (May 2000). I like the coverage and the approach (not too technical) but, oh my gawd, it doesn't read well. Long convoluted sentences. Diagrams that don't always communicate much. On the plus side, if you're an accountant, this is the probably the best ecommerce book around."
4,RARE stuff,"This book reveals West's beauty secrets and health regimens. A MUST for real Mae West collectors and is WAY out of print, and was never even released in the U.S.! It is ghost written, but very good. The ESP parts are fascinating."
5,"Define ""Normal""?","When Antonia Dillon joins the new peer counseling program at her school, she excpects it to be a breeze. But when she learns that she has been paired up with Jasmine ""Jazz"" Luther, a punker, she is anything but eager. Her only motive to stay in the program is that it would help her get into the advanced placement program next year. Then, she can achieve her dream-going to college a year early. Jazz also has a dream-a secret ambition she can't share with anyone. Nonetheless, Antonia and Jazz seem to be nothing alike- Jazz is a ""punker, a druggie, a gang hanger, etc"". Antonia is a ""priss, a ya-ya, and so on"". But as their peer counseling sessions progress, they find out they are a lot more alike than they think. This book is truely entertaining and original. Teens and adults alike will be able to relate to it. I wholeheartedly suggest this novel to anyone!"
4,Good Read,"I found ""Define Normal"" to be an easy and occasionally cliche, but overall good read. I'm using it for a book club this summer with 9th-12th grade students, and I think the simple language of the book really speaks to Jr. and Sr. High School students. The biggest strength of the book is showing that both sides of the conformist vs. non-conformist battles in school mis-undertand each other - it's much more complicated than a case of the prisses not getting the individuality of the punks, etc. While older audiences may find the book simple, the book will resonate well with a target audience of sixth grade through high school seniors, and possibly even college students with the right facilitator."
5,Different,This book shows how opposites really do attract. You may thinkyour friend has to be just like you but that is not true. This alsoshows that there is no true way to be normal.
4,hard to find,School had this book on required reading list but ran out of copies. I was able to get a copy for granddaughter in time and even saved some cash.
3,a view from the other side,Define normal shows how two difernt children with not too much in common. Can over come the differences to become friends that can last a long time.
2,Not Very Good!!,"I was assigned to read ""Define Normal"" & if not for that, I wouldn't have finished it. I think the age level it was meant for doesn't match the age level that would actually enjoy it. I agree very much with the review that called it dry, it lacked emotion & any depth into the characters. I found it boring & corny. I just don't really think that the author really has much talent. It's not a book someone could really get into. The only positive thing about it is that it's easy & fast to read, only I think a 4 year old could read it. Nope, I would say, don't waste your time & money."
1,sparatically emotional,"i read this book after reading a series of wonderful teen books. this book just did not meet the standards i had set for it. i recommend it for a younger audience of 11-13 years. though it started out on a good note and set a clear mood throughout the initial part of the book, the remained was filled with a cheap and cliched approach. it lacked the real life drama and angst that we all feel. this book was a disappointment. after hoping for a strong and emotional ending that would have pulled the book out of the hole it had dug itself into, all the dirt just fell in on it."
5,"Define ""Normal""","Define ""Normal"" is a book about a girl name Antonia who goes to peer counseling and ends up with a girl who is totally different from herself. Antonia's mother gets very sick, Antonia and her brothers end up in a foster home but they eventually go back home with there mother. My favorite part of this book was when Antonia's mother comes home from the hospital, Antonia and her brothers then get to go home with thier mother. I recommend this book because it could help you if you had a similar problem. It shows that you should not judge people by how they look but you should get to know them first. Also, if you have a problem it could help you if you talk about it. It shows you about how if you just give things time, it will be alright."
3,This book...........,"This book was slow, and very mediocre. I would recommend it to any middle schooler who like sstories about friends.THe irony of this book is that ""Tone"" thinks she is the one who is ""normal"" throughout the book she begins to realize that she is the one, who is in fact not the ""normal"" one. It was interesting. It took awhile for me to finish becasue I wanted to put it down because it was boring. But I finally finished it and the author finished it well. It made me think about what true friendship is.This book shows what friendship is all about. It has all the parts of it; forgiveness, love, fun, fights, and everything that goes along with what a real friend is. This book is ok, but not for anybody who is older than 15."
3,"Define ""Normal""","As an avid reader, I usually don't find too much to complain about after finishing a book. I think this may have to be an exception. There was nothing wrong with the plot itself, but I found it a dry book. However, I believe that if I had been younger when reading this, I may have found it much more pleasurable. It teaches good values and positive lessons. The book shows how to accept people different from you and how to learn from your mistakes. Opposites attract and learn from each other in this book. ""Define 'Normal'"" relays that you can be friends with people that are different from you, and it is possible to look beyond the dissimilarities."
4,"Interesting, even funny at times","I liked this book. It was pretty cool, and on the overall, quite well-written. I finished it in one day though. The story wasn't too long, and I felt the author could've written it even better if she'd put in more to give us more complete, 3-dimensional characters. However Julie Anne Peters has tackled the problems that teenagers nowadays do face, so we can relate. The plot was o.k, really, at first it started off a little not-so-good, but then the story started to thicken and you got more involved with Jazz and Antonia. That was when it started to get interesting and made you want to read on. I liked the part about the girls' peer counseling programs, and their discussions. It seemed genuine enough, like typical conversations, not fake or contrived. Like I said though, this is a good book on the whole, even if not excellent. Those aged 11 and above will probably enjoy it. 'Define ""Normal"" ' makes for good, fun reading."
5,Great book!,"I read this book for my English class, and I loved it! Anyone who goes to school nowadays (well, it takes place in the present, but is relevant to anyone's time) can see a relation from this book to their lives. The way how people judge each other by what they wear before they get to know them and realize they have alot in common. Now I'm gonna stop myself from giving away any spoilers. I'm telling you, READ THIS BOOK! There's not much more to say! Just go! Why are you wasting your time reading this review when you could be reading this magnificent book?!"
1,"Quite possibly, the worst phone EVER made!","I've had this phone for about 8 months now, and what a horrible experience it has been. My god, who created this software? It is unbelievably slow, and literally freezes on average about three times a day. It freezes during texts, calls, internet, camera, EVERYTHING. Oh god, and the battery life? Don't get me started, the first day I bought it, fully charged it lasted maybe 5 hrs. I figured ok, maybe the battery needs to be broken in, WRONG! Battery life has been in the toilet ever since. This is the absolute worst garbage phone I have ever owned."
4,Good Phone - Bad Battery,"I loved this phone. It worked well with excellent reception for about 9 months. Suddenly, it would not hold charge for more than 12 hours even when on standby. I opened the back and noticed it had a BR53 battery. The Motorola web site recommends a BR50 battery. I bought a replacement on Amazon (about $7 including shipping) and now the phone again works great. I wonder if Sprint had Motorola install a a cheaper battery that doesn't work as long for the Sprint phones as a cost saving measure?"
1,RAZR = P.O.S.,"This was the biggest waste of money ever which sucks because i really like the look and feel of this phone. However, when it comes to battery life and ability to hold a signal, it sucks. After using it a month, the battery was shot and getting reception inside anywhere was a crap shoot.Do not be swayed by the appearance of this phone. It is a wolf in sheeps clothing folks. Beware....beware."
2,complete disappointment,This has to be the worst phone I have ever owned. It takes forever for it load or do anything. The sound is muffled. The battery life only lasts a few hours even after a full charge. Hate it! I will never own another one.
4,samsung phones,"Received phones and add'l. products in record time and in perfect shape.So far, only problem is the battery on the phones uses up too quickly."
2,Worse phone ever,"This has the be the worst phone ever! I bought it to help a good cause but the phone itself sucks! I got it in December and not even 2 weeks after I got it the buttons were stuck. So everytime I opened the phone it would pull up my call history and start calling automatically. So I returned the phone for a replacement... Mind you that its barely April and the MP3 player doesn't work anymore. It freezes and then just turns off. The picture quality on this phone isnt what I expected it either. Then the texting fuction isnt very user friendly. As I was writing this review I was sending a text and the phone just turned off. Also, the battery life isnt very good either. The phone is constantly freezing.Looks wise... the phone is great! Its a beautiful phone. But other than that it doesnt have anything else going for it."
1,Not the track list in other review,"I bought this thinking it was Forro Bodo, with pop and rock musicians performing Forro songs, as in the track list in other review. That is not the CD I was looking for"
3,Pretty Good Vacuum,"I purchased this vacuum from a local dealer (and spent way too much,[$]). Chief complaint is that in order to use the tools, you have to connect BOTH ends of the hose... one to the vacuum and one to the tool you want to attach. You also have to change the bare floors pedal on the nozzle (floor thingy) with your hands. My thumb is sore and I have only had the vacuum 5 days...It picks up dirt very good, but be careful on rugs with fringes."
1,Plagiarism!!!,"This book, like many other of this cult's books, was plagiarized from previously published, copyrighted sources. See http://groups.yahoo.com/group/eckankartruth/message/1101 for documentation.For more information about this subtle cult, begin your research at http://www.geocities.com/eckcultIf you're interested in this subject, do a search on the author of the original works from which Twitchell stole material -- F. Homer Curtiss.Information in German is located at:http://vclass.mtsac.edu:940/dlane/german.html"
4,African Cosmology,"Outstanding very well written as far as understanding the concept of time and the begining of the universe from the Bantu Kongo tradition, and who is who as far as some Kongo deities who coincide with the mpungos or deities we know in Cuba, but the author kind of gets a litle bit revolutionary in his way of writing sort of reminds me of Maoist and black power movement of the 1960's and 1970's.But again this book was a collaboration of various writings from the author in different time periods. Overall I like the book and look froward to read more from this author."
1,what a tittle!!!!!!!!!!!,"The best part of this movie is the tittle. I'm not kidding. Actually at some point in the first half hour or so the two main girls suddenly get in a girlie catfight scene rip off each others tops.This and a short part at the end is all the nudity you will see. However the eye candy so to speak are quite large and nice to look at. And as a bonus for sitting through this crap or for those of you who have figured out how to work the fast forward button, you get to see those lovely breasts getting blood sprayed all over them for a good minute or so. Which is great in that sex and death kinda way. (I guess)The acting although not in english language just looked kinda sad and the fight scenes were kinda low budgety. You wouldn't be missing as much as the tittle implies if you never see this movie.On the other hand try Tokyo Gore Police it's significantly better than this."
2,"buy the Boss, its better",I bought this to replace my Boss crossover on my subwoofers and ended up re-installing the Boss. It seems to leave out certain frequencies. I haven't tried it on my highs yet
4,Great Album,"I love Allan's music.However, I think he is better as an improviser than a composer. This is evident (to me) on this album, which is why I have only awarded 4 stars.It cannot be denied that Allan's improvising is in a class of its own. However, his compositions don't seem to sit right with me, although I must admit they do grow on you after you have listened to them a lot.Still, I highly recommend this album, and others like it, in particular: Secrets, Wardenclyffe Tower, Atavachron, None Too Soon, 16 Men of Tain and Truth in Shredding."
3,Not what I ordered,"I would not recommand ordering from this Company, this was the second item I ordered from this company, parts were missing, the stools were to be stationary, they were swivel, very cheaply made, I sent a letter with no response."
4,Little Tykes kitchen dish/pot/pans set,"I purchased this item and the suggested age on the front of the package says 2+ This site says the manufacturer suggests 4 and up. My 2 year old boy has been playing with the set and loves it. I liked this set because everything wasnt pink! The set mathces his Little Tykes Interavtive kitchen that is blue, green, yellow, and white. I'm glad not all kitchens are pink and purple! Boys need to play in the kitchen too:)"
3,Wrong colors!!,"I recieved this toy today and I was dissapointed that it is not pastel colors as shown in the photo. Instead it is silver/gray pots and lids with blue knobs and the utensils have green handles. It doesn't look very little girl-ish , but my daughter has had alot of fun playing with it anyway. The handles on the spatula and ladle are quite flimsy , but the pots and lids are sturdy and fit together well. My daughter loves the salt and pepper shakers because they rattle when she shakes them."
3,Lovely pastel colored cooking set,"I just purchased this today for my 16 month old son as he always seemed to be playing with our cooking pots and pans. I liked the pastel colors on this one - green, yellow, pink, blue. Very gender neutral. The only thing is it doesnt come with make believe food so you have to provide your own. My son was searching for things to put in the pans as he didnt want to play with empty ones."
5,Great Product! Perfect for our wagon!,We purchased this product for a storage spot in a new wagon we bought and it's perfect! Heavy duty and holds a perfect amount of beverages/food/snacks.
4,Thick heavy cream,This is a thick heavy cream that aborbs quickly. The 'vanilla' is a bit strong but fades quickly.
3,"OK, but not great","While this book has some good points, it is not the cure-all it claims to be. There are two major flaws. First, as a few other people have noted, much of the savings is getting donations of food, photography, etc. But also most of the weddings profiled are not ""regular weddings,"" which need the most budget help. Most of the weddings are second marriages, which are generally less lavish anyway, and they are not standard weddings i.e. church/synagogue. As a result, for a first-time bride who wants a church wedding, there isn't that much advise.My final comment: check it out of the library, because it's not worth buying new."
2,Not worth it,"It was definitely neat reading about others' weddings, but the advice in here is impractical, and impossible to follow depending on your situation. As previously mentioned, most of the couples in the book managed to have a cheap wedding by having friends and family donate things - food and photography services, in particular. If you don't have chefs or photographers in your family, this book's not going to be much help.The weddings written about are definitely creative, but if you have a large family or are dreaming of a traditional wedding instead of a $5000 elopement to Disneyland or a casual barefoot-on-the-beach affair, you'll be out of luck with this book."
1,Save your money!,SURE you can have a wedding under $5000...if you want less than 10 people and have a friend whos a photographer or a caterer...according to this book. But let's get real for a second....not everyone has a friend of a friend in the photography business. I'm pretty sure you couldn't even get ONE pictures for $50...let alone a whole album! I should have saved the $10 I spent on this book for more wedding favors! Now I've wasted even MORE money!
1,ridiculous,"The title of the book should be "" How to be cheap without losing your dignity"". It's impractical for most people outside of the midwest. I was given this book as a gift and I promptly donated it to my local public library. I wouldn't dare pass it on."
1,Extort your friends and family!,"According to this book, the way to have a ""Priceless Wedding for under $5000"" is to rope your friends and family into footing much of the bill by providing to you, free of charge, catering services, music, photography, ceremony and reception locations, flowers... and so on. In the price breakdowns in the book, huge ticket items are not even counted as costs if someone other than the bride or groom writes the check or does the work. Oh, and items bartered for are also counted as a ""free"" items. Also, the rings, the honeymoon, ""pre-wedding"" stuff, such as the rehersal dinner, are not counted in the cost. Finally, some of the figures in the sample budgets are totally unrealistic. For example, in at least one incident, under stationary (for 100+) the total would not even pay for the postage (invitation, RSVP, thank-you notes) let alone the stationary itself..."
1,Never let ANYONE other than a WEDDING pro take your pictures,"Even if you have a cousin Billy who is going to photography school, don't let anyone besides a photographer with a lot of wedding experience take your pictures.I am a non-wedding photographer, and no matter what anyone tells you weddings are hard. I have taken wedding photos for friends and other people who just ""needed someone"" or ""wanted to save some money."" Even though I'm a pretty good photographer, weddings are a like no other photography job on earth...the families, the rushing, the stress. I know that my photos weren't just as good as the expensive pros.Trust me, you want someone who has experience with that kind of pressure. You spent the money on the wedding, don't skimp on preserving those memories. It's not worth it.There's a reason why really good wedding photographers cost so much!"
4,Still relevant!,"Was concerned at first that this book would be outdated, but found many ideas and tips that are still VERY practical. Loved how it included real weddings and how they saved $. Perfectly describes step-by-step how to come up with a budget and stick to it. This was very useful!"
1,Not helpful at all,"This book was a total waste of money. The elegant weddings cost so little because the brides have family or friends who provide food, liquor, photos, reception sites, etc. If you have an aunt who is a professional wedding photographer, you probably don't need to spend money on a book that tells you to ask her to take your photos. If you don't have family who can provide these services, or you don't want to ask your friends to provide a dish for a potluck reception, then do yourself a favor and save the money you planned to spend on this book for your wedding itself. It should receive zero stars."
2,Not helpful at all,"I have a large family (9 sisters, 1 brother, plus their kids, etc.), so this book wasn't very helpful.Also, the tips for getting family members to help out with the cake and misc wedding stuff, DUH! The crafty members of my family are going to help me out to cut the cost.This guide is not practical at all. Save your money and be creative with ways to cut costs for your wedding."
1,"Ironically, not much bang for the buck","This book would be great if it were the only one out there. However, it is most certainly not. The only original parts of the book (and by that I mean ideas that you couldn't find elsewhere) were the dollar breakdowns of some actual weddings for less than $5,000. Those examples were very specific scenarios, and if you weren't one of those similar situations(ie: having a friend or family with a home large enough for your guestlist), there wasn't much value gained from the book.Given the target audience for the book are couples trying to get the most for their dollar, the book itself fails to carry it's own weight. Page for page, better value can be found elsewhere, such as Bridal Bargains by Denise and Alan Fields. There wasn't a single idea in Priceless Weddings that I didn't find in Bridal Bargains."
1,Unrealistic advice,"I bought this book with high hopes, only to discover that the author's recommendations involve sponging off your friends and family. Sure, I could save money on a wedding and anything else, if I manipulate my friends into donating their valuable time and services. Almost every example given involved people who happened to have friends available to do photography, help with food, etc. I'm sure my friends would help, but why on earth would I expect them to do so??? This book was ridiculous and presumptous. I'm returning my copy."
5,A Great Complement to Yessongs,"This video is a great video record of how Yes was during their Relayer tour. The sound mix isn't perfect, but completely listenable. Unlike Volume 1 which reflected serious sound problems at the original show, the virtuosity of all of the musicians, particularly Steve Howe, comes through very clearly. ""And You and I"" and ""Ritual"" are performed magnificently, with Patrick Moraz's contribution yielding a different take on the material. The downside to this video is it's length; considered by itself it's short. Even so, Yes is arguably at its best live, and seeing this music played live is much more moving than just hearing it live."
4,Little confused I am as a reader,"If one is to avoid dating a woman unless she is potential marriage partner, how does the author explain that in business or school world, a young man has lunch or dinner or study / business group regularly with young women whom he has zero intention to marry? If he replies that the man does those in public areas, what is an office or a library cubicle anything but alone-time with opposite sex? Does he think that the more such time one spends the more likely the man and woman will end up in bed?"
3,"Entertaining, interesting, but fell a little short","I really enjoyed reading this book. It was short, fairly easy to understand, and had some very comical stories and advice. This professor obviously cares very deeply for his students--and after attending a private, Catholic university for a semester and beginning my second, I can't help but wish I had a professor here that was like who he says he is! It is evident that God is using him on that campus!On the other hand, I had to question the realism of Budzsizeski's stories. If I remember correctly, he might have given some sort of disclaimer about their accuracy, but either way, the book came across as sort of juvenile, at it's worst mocking. I would recommend the book because of its directness and simplicity--for someone who doesn't particularly like to read, it's great--but for the mature Christian, it will seem a little dated and obvious.However, don't get me wrong....it had me laughing!"
2,"GOOD BOOK, BUT OTHERS ARE BETTER","Being a serious Firearms engraver I have seen many, many, books on firearms engraving. This book is only ""fair"" compaired to, for example, ""Steel Canvas"" (by same Author). I purchased it hopeing for lots of Model 94 engravings, but there are few. Most of the engravings are of pre-94 receivers and most photos are Black & White, and some are of only poor to fair quality. I thought this book was over priced for the material it contained. Again I would point the engraver or collector of books on firearms engraving to ""Steel Canvas"" as a book with better quality photos, better ideas, and better overall quality in general"
2,"Cute, but not practical","If you have read my other glowing Pistoulet reiviews you will know that it breaks my heart to have to give a ""bad"" review to this line of beautiful dishes. These are cute little salt and pepper shakers, but unfortunately they don't let the salt come out--it is a frustrating experience to try to salt your food with these! The pepper shaker works better. The holes must not be big enough--or it is the interior design of the salt shaker.I have tried all of the usual tricks--putting a peice of pasta (uncooked) in there to break the salt up--and also putting a saltine cracker in there (hard to do with such a tiny hole in the bottom!) to absorb moisture, but unfortunatly nothing works.They now live in my China hutch for decorative purposes only."
5,Love Pistoulet,"Very cute. I have had no problem with the salt shaker as previous reviewers have. Maybe they have fixed the problem. I was concerned about buying them but thought my husband, Mr. Fix-it, could take care of the hole being too small. I just really wanted to get all the pieces of the Pistoulet set and I'm glad I threw caution to the wind."
4,So cute...yet so useless,"I received most of the Pistoulet set for my wedding, and I'm afraid I must agree with the first reviewer; while the salt & pepper shaker set is very cute, the salt just won't come out of the shaker. Personally, I'm not the sort to go out and buy extra-fine sea salt each time I need salt, just so that my salt shaker will work properly. At first, I thought the salt was damp, but no, the holes must not be large enough.I have pottery tools, so I may try to core the holes out. If that works, I'll come back and edit the review to let folks know.EDIT: 8/1/11I got the tools, carved the holes, and they work great now. Love them! Still have them. They're still cute as can be and now, they work great, too!"
5,The Shadow over second Review,I think everybody that likes baseball should read this book because I thought it was a very good baseball book. The characters are very nice.
4,High Chair Graduation,"My 2-year-old daughter really resisted moving to a booster seat. She didn't want to give up her high chair throne. This placemat made all the difference. She eagerly sits at the table with us with her truck placemat and directs us to put things in certain places (""peas on the concrete mixer!"") As other reviewers have noted the colors aren't that durable -- don't use a serious scrub brush on them -- but that's the only drawback I see. Great way to engage your child at the table."
2,Concerned about safety,"Really cute, but cleaning concerns me. The paint (?) comes off easily just with water and a paper towel. Any little scrubbing causes scratches in the picture. I am concerned that this paint may come off on foods my son was eating. We have only used a few months, if that, and are now moving on to a a different placemat"
3,Cute placemat - coloring wearing off quickly.,Placemat is cute. I've had for two months and the color is coming off (I didn't do anything special to gently clean though)
2,"Cute car pictures, but...","The plastic is thin, flimsy and slides around on the table. Easy to get folds stuck in it. Picture scratches off very easily. Regret purchase."
4,"Fun mix of sci-fi, pop-culture and academia","An interesting and fun novel mixing bizarre elements of sci-fi, pop-culture and academia. A good break from the pompous ""literary"" writers and the standard sci-fi/fantasy fare, but still filled with ideas well worth looking at. Fans of Phillip K. Dick's later work would probably love this."
1,Big People Only,"I have a terrible neck, and was desperate. This is good for big people, but I would say you must be taller than 5' 6."" It does not help you if you have a bad neck either. Try a medical wedge."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered ""Integrating the Arts Across the Elementary School Curriculum"" and ""Art and Cognition: Integrating the Visual Arts in the Curriculum""and ""Arts as Meaning Makers, The: Integrating Literature and the Arts Throughout the Curriculum"". I was so disappointed to see this book had only a small section at the end of the book describing any lesson plans to use integrating art in the curriculum, and the book cost $55.00! I thought for that price I would have had a book full of information I could use in my classroom. I would not buy this book again, in fact I would like to get a refund. Surprisingly, ""Arts as Meaning Makers, The: Integrating Literature and the Arts Throughout the Curriculum"" turned out to be much more informative and useful and it was only $6.97."
1,Doesn't Work,This doesn't work at all. I installed it correctly and my Mac Pro will not recognize it all no matter what I do. Waste of time and money...
4,Works as advertised,"A simple, tough and effective compressor. 2 dials, doesn't need more. Great for live use. Anything more and you're looking at a much more costly product if you want the same or better quality."
5,amazing,Mark knopfler uses very few pedals and this is one of em. Incredible sustain and boost. Makes my thin rig sound more expressive. Makes my solid state sound like a tube.
4,I really like this,"This has a distinctive ""sound"" to it (more like the compressor has a distinctive style of attack/release) and, if you like that sound, it's great. I really do so I'm very happy."
5,Great compressor!,"This compressor gives a lot of sustain, i use this with a PRS SE NICK CATANESE with mics emg-81/85 and a FENDER AMERICAN STANDARD STRATOCASTER and works perfect, adds punch to my clean tone and gain tones also, its essencial in my pedalboard, 100% recommended!"
1,stopped working within two days of light use,my husband bought this along with four other pedals and got two days of playing around with them over the holidays before this one stopped working. He's a pretty handy guy and could not get it to work again. It was returned; they others are going strong.
2,Doesnt do a lot :(,Compared to the vintage Dynacomp the new model seems quite weak. It doesnt have the raw power of the originals and not a lot of comp range at all. Look for an original version...
5,Great recording,Another Tiomkin soundtrack is realeased in it's original form. Well worth waiting for. Bring 'em on!
1,Bringing out my best!,I received this book as a gift and did not give it much thought until I was backing up my computer one day and had some spare time on my hands. While I was looking for something to read I spotted the book that I had laid on my desk. Once I got started with it I shut my door and read it cover to cover. It is just like being in one of those seminars that you never want to leave. I couldn't wait to try out the recommendations.
1,Beware of eldest children bearing gifts,"The featuring of this book on Netscape today bookmarks a new low in pop culture. It was one of the fastest reads I've had in many years. For those youngest sibs upon whom this book was inflicted, keep in mind people like Marie Curie and J.S. Bach. Would you rather heal millions, write exquisite music celebrated down the centuries or be C.E.O. of Coca Cola?"
2,Be Careful!,"This cartridge is supposed to be the same as LC51BK but it will not work in my Brother printer/fax. It does not recognize the cartridge. When I compare the ""real"" cartridge to this one I notice a difference: there is a little plastic pin that sticks out of the top of the ""real"" cartridge and is making contact with something inside the printer. The ""comparable"" cartridge looks exactly the same and fits in the slot perfectly, but does not have this little plastic piece so my printer is acting like the cartridge is not installed at all. BE CAREFUL and check your old cartridge before purchasing this one. It is a great deal but may not work for you!"
3,This is okay ink for the price,The cartridges do not fit in snuggly and seem to not be all the way full. I changed out all my cartridegs on the same day and there is still plenty in the yellow and black but the cyan is empty and the magenta is about 1/3. I do not print very many color
2,Vulgar and unrestrained,"As we all know, classical rules of poetry dictate that no violence must be shown on stage, that the protagonist must be admirable except for one fatal flaw, that the declamation must be dignified and poetic. Seneca violates all of these rules, plus many others. His protagonists are nothing but shrieking hysterical fools, and the stage is awash in blood by the end of every play. As for the ""poetry,"" it is nonexistent. Perhaps I just read a bad translation, but I still recommend that anyone who is seeking a Roman imitation of Sophocles or Aeschylus to forgo Seneca."
3,a novelty that quickly lost its appeal,"Got this for my 2 year old- he really loved it at first, but when the novelty wore off after maybe 15 minutes it quickly went to the bottom of the toy box. Only played with occasionally now. It rarely lands on its feet even after many adjustments. One of our less played-with toys, and the yapping is a little annoying. However it does seem durable and the battery life so far is good- but maybe thats because he doesn't get it out much."
2,Just okay,"I think this book is just a category romance a little bit old-fashioned. So if you want one story with a 1980s touch, this one is for you.It was predictable. You know what is going to happen and when. Very little sexy scenes, and not steamy at all.It was interesting that the hero has his doubts about what to do with his feelings and with her. But I didn't find him very attractive in the end.What I liked most was the heroine, because she has clear ideas and real backbone. She wants a little bit of adventure in her life, knows how to shoot an AK-47 but at the same time she is practical: she does not want just a one-night-stand. So she says clearly 'I have better things to do until you make up your mind, baby'. And one of those things is the laundry. It was funny! In romance novels many times it looks as if they don't do this kind of common things."
4,quietly stunning,"I've loved Mindy Smith's voice from the first time I heard her version of ""..Berkley Square"" on an album that showcased new talent. I've wished she'd sing a few more standards with that incredibly rich voice of hers.I love this album...it's quiet and understated in her usual style but few singers today sound as true as she does and as honest."
4,Mindy Smith develops her unique Sound,"This album is a big improvement on Mindy Smith's debut (One Moment More). The developments will continue yet further, coming to full fruition with her third album (Stupid Love).I can't wait for the fourth album to come out. Will there be yet more improvement? New converts to Mindy Smith can start here, or better yet start with Stupid Love. This album gets 4 stars because Stupid Love is still better yet than this one."
4,A nice listen,"Sadly, she's chosen not to go down the country/folk route (sorry I just can't call it Americana!), but this is still a class piece of recording. The songs are strong, her voice is wonderful and the playing is very good too. Sometimes it's just nice to sit back and enjoy what is going through the ears and tells the brain that you like it!"
5,Sweet Voice,Mindy Smith has a great voice and it shines on her second offering. You will not be disappointed. Just as soulful as her first.
3,disappointing,"I have only recently been exposed to Mindy Smith. A few of the songs on Moment to Moment really grabbed me very quickly. That album is most satisfying, the vocals pure and natural and very beautiful.Long Island Shores...the title song is the the only song worthy of Mindy's voice. My impression is that the folks advising Mindy advised that she go with the cliche vocal stylings which are currently pumping sales for others. I was turned off almost immediately by Mindy's apparent abandonment of her natural style. She has no need to emulate anyone."
2,2.5 stars to be precise,"Great vocals does not a great song make. Yes, her vocals are comprable to that of Patty Griffin, but Patty Griffin she ain't. None of the songs on this album will be remembered past tomorrow and you can't make mediocre songs amazing just with vocals. There has to be music and lyrics to go along with the vocals to make you feel what the songs are saying. I feel nothing for any of these songs. They are mostly lazily written tunes without an ounce of emotion.One bright note is the title track, ""Long Island Shores"". I almost think as though she feels something here, but even this gem is enough to pull this album up to 3 stars."
4,The kind of music I like,"The sticker on the front of Mindy Smith's new CD quotes a USA Today review, with comparisons to Patty Griffin and Alison Krauss in Ms. Smith's singing style. Those are apt comparisons, and I would add Karen Peris too (singer of the Innocence Mission). In any case, this is sublime music -- well written tunes, beautifully sung, and with very good performances by the supporting players. L.I. Shores is an even better album than Mindy's solid debut effort - no sophomore jinx here."
5,Get it!,"Great follow-up to her incomparable first album. Beautiful songs, lightly produced. I'd love to see her live, but she doesn't seem to tour much. Wonderful stuff!"
3,Useful Beauty,"I found this book to be interesting and informative. It had some good suggestions for, as it says, useful beauty. Although most books are on the how to's only, this book did include design ideas. However, the items were not all that unknown and different, so I found myself interested more in the technique he used than in the ideas themselves. I think it is a good beginner book but not really interesting to a more experienced turner."
4,Total match,"I hesitated buying this product for 4 month because in the picture the inside looks so white. I was afraid it not match, as there is no white on the print of the dishes. But, I was surprised to find that the picture reflects the white from the flash and the inside is not as white as it seems in the photo. It matches perfectly!"
3,It's Fine When It Isn't Broken,"I've had a T-41 for about two years. It's been back to IBM three times for new motherboards when the video went out. It's been back once for a new wireless card. A second wireless card is coming via delivery service as I type. This time I get to put it in.I've had several Thinkpads and love their functionality. IBM's service people are friendly and helpful. The problem is that I'm getting to know the guys in Atlanta way too well.I asked IBM to replace this T-41 as a lemon. They responded by giving me an extra year of warranty. That was nice, but every time this thing goes down, it costs me lost time, and for someone who is self employed that is a bad thing."
2,ibm thinkpad,i bought this for my kids and traveling and paid around 150 give some take some.but i would not buy from this company ever again. YES its refurbished but i thought that also ment the battery would stay charged.it dont the only way it works is plugged in the wall outlet all the time.and i got no paperwork(company# or info on laptop) from company on anything with it.dont get me wrong but it dos work when its plugged in.notto pleased cause i got to buy a battery.buy the time im done i should of bought new.
5,Overall lowest cost with proven reliability and quality,"This is the first ThinkPad I bought for myself, the other three that I have been used in the past eight years were provided by the company I worked for.Decision making was easy:1. Overall lowest cost: after deducted the costs for 3-year warranty, high resolution LCD screen, Windows XP Pro, slim and light-weight design and quality material.2. Proven reliability: this means there won't be extra costs to burden my 3-year ownership.3. Excellent technical support (I called IBM technical support once in August, one month after I got T41, and was surprised that the tech. support rep. picked up the phone right the way and guided me step by step to go through the problem I had. They even followed up with a call to confirm the problem has been solved!Yes, I am more than happy to recommend IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) to you. However, the best buy is with $100 rebate from Amazon."
4,"great screen, decent battery, but the cd/dvd stinks","nice laptop. make sure to spend the extra dough and get the 1400x1050 screen cause it is awesome.it has decent battery life of around 3hrs.but the dvd/cd-rom doesnt read anything. not even store bought discs. i have had ibm ship me a new cdrom unit and it still stinks. however because i use this laptop primarily to program .NET i am still thinking about keeping it even though the cdrom is a glaring defect. the problem may be based in windows so i cant say for sure its IBM's fault, but come on. out of the box and it cant play even my store bought DVD's?"
3,NOT a T41.,"Well, it wasn't a T41, it was a T40...and the Wifi didn't work at all...there was no screw holding the HD in the case...the RAM was agonizingly low, can't believe that it came from the factory this way, but, after bloat and XP Pro SP3, it c r a w l s....BUT, better days ahead!{And Jenny, I absolve you Sister, and beg your pardon, and no, that wasn't a joke...I want your forgiveness at this point...I'm the one who needs it not you...I was very wrong to the way I did, and again no, the money going for other peoples gifts at this stage'Don't worry about the laptop, I have a friend with cancer who might like to play with it or something...he might put a bigger HD in it and use it as a LINUX machine, but, I don't think that will happen; he hates IBM more than he hates working of Fords...Yours TrulyRaymond M. Krulczyk}"
2,IBM - No Reliability - Product Sucks,"I bought this New T41 2 months ago, Product is awesome, but after 6 weeks of use, the hard disk crashed, and when i called up IBM, they said that they would replace the hard disk with a new one, and the data from the old one cannot be restored. Lost all my data. So, if ur planning to buy it, I would suggest u to buy an external data storage."
4,Not bad at all,"Music has too big influence of pop, but it is still ok. My biggest concern about this CD is that disk looks like a fraud made in CD writer. Even printed enlcosed brochure has suspicious polygraphic defects. So be careful!"
5,Ran the Stoplight?,"Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all."
2,save a little money and go with the dvd format.,"i love the show, i'm still a fan despite the low rating i gave it. the rating is due to the video quality. as you're probably already reading the other reviews. the blu ray just isn't blu ray quality. most of the story line scenes are grainy. my old dvd's utilizing the upconvert from my player looks more clean than these so called ""blu rays"". however there are some cut scenes, like the flyby shots of miami buildings, beaches and ocean, between story scenes, that are definitely crispy clear blu ray quality. but they're only transition scenes that only account for about 2% of the episodes. not worth the extra money, just get the dvds."
1,WOW!! what a disappointment...,"I'm a big fan of this show and wanted to have at least one season in BR. I read other reviewers and their disappointments, but wanted to take a chance anyway... What a mistake!!! My BR connection is as follow: PS3 connected (via v1.3b 'Thats true HDMI 1080p spec' HDMI cable) to a Samsung 8500 series LED TV...I don't think you can go more pure HD than that, but the result I got was the same as other reviewers... grainy (oh yeah... sound was ok, not spectacular)... Here's a short conclusion for those who want this in BR... Save your money and go get the DVD version instead..."
1,Do not buy this,"I love Burn Notice, I have seen every episode, period. USA and Donavan are exceptional in these drama series. DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY because the quality of the transfer to Blu-Ray is criminal, at least fraudulant. I have a friend who has the DVD version and looks good. This is a disaster and the producers of this farce should be ashamed and the company should issue an immediate recall. A lemon. Shame on you."
5,Best Show Ever!!...Blu-Ray is Very Good,"I only want to talk about the Blu-Ray version. Depsite the numerous reviews saying the Blu-Ray version is horrible, it isn't. I have no idea what they are talking about. I just popped it in 10 mins ago and I think it's perfectly fine. It looks like I am watching it on USA. Those reviews were from 2009, and it's 2010, so mabye it's better than from a year ago.So if you want to buy this, buy it on Blu-Ray because it's worth it and it's currently cheaper than the DVD version. I am not disappointed at all."
2,No Episode Guide with DVD,"No complaints about the Burn Notice series. If you like the show and enjoyed Season 1, you'll like Season 2 also. My criticism is the packaging of the DVD. This is as absolute bare-bones a purchase as you get: just the DVD discs. No glossy fold-out episode guide or anything else came with this. I don't necessarily expect much, but I do expect _something_. There isn't even a hardcopy list of DVD content with what's on each disc -- and I consider that a mandatory minimum for a purchase like this."
5,Best show of its type in years...,"I do enjoy Burn Notice.....Back in the day I loved Magnum/ Miami Vice and such, but they look so slow and dated these days..... great for a nostalgic visit but not much more....Well ""Burn Notice"" is the modern equivalent for 2009. Fast funny and clever with great action, great characters and great script. The show has such a glossy expensive look too. It's hard to imagine that at some time in the future this excellent show will look dated too. Well not for quite a while I would suggest. Enjoy Burn Notice now while it surfs on the leading edge of the new wave. Great stuff, but I think it will run out of steam after this series..... only that many new ideas and directions left."
5,Burn Notice rules TV Land,What can I say? Burn Notice rocks! One of the best television shows ever. Jeffrey Donovan rules as Michael Westen. I cannot believe he and/or the show have not been nominated for some kind of awards yet.
2,Don't buy Blu-ray version,"Burn Notice season two rocks! But I thought I was going to go crazy trying to get all my settings right on my home theater! I figured out that it wasn't my TV, it's the Blu-ray disc, what a waste of money! The picture is worse than SD-DVD by far. Keep e-mailing [...]!!!!"
1,VHS Quality on Blu-ray?,"Do not buy this great series on Blu-ray as the video quality is like a VHS tape, I never knew Miami had snow until I watched this! Buy it on DVD (saving $20 in the process) and play on an upscaling DVD player for better quality. I am now very skeptical on TV series Blu-ray's and always read reviews on the quality aspect first, which is a pity because Blu-ray can look totally awesome dudes!"
1,"Great series, inadequate BluRay transfer: DVD only","You've read the other reviews. The HD version on the USA channel was great. That did not make it to most of the BluRay (curiously, the between-scene landscape shots are in good HD!). You'd think the home video industry is mature enough to prevent this Yugo of a BluRay from being made. What's going to happen because of this fiasco? I (and likely many others) will wait for reviews of upcoming USA series on BluRay before purchase. Maybe someone will notice.I guess it would be nice if there was a ""THX"" for BluRay so we could have an independent certification of transfer quality."
5,LOVE BURN NOTICE!,"Burn Notice is an amazing show! I wasn't a huge fan of it when I first started watching, but the more you watch it, the more you get sucked in! My friend borrowed the seasons from me, and she's hooked now too! I can't wait for the 2nd half of Season 3 to start!"
5,Entertaining,"This series is one of the more entertaining series on tv today. Three friends with entirely different backgrounds and purposes in life find a way to work together and do something good for someone each week. The show blends romance, technology, crime solving, teamwork, and humor. Good guys DO win!!!"
1,Good TV show but sold in a lousy package.,Liked the second season but the package it was put into was not up to the standard of the first season's package.Very cheap box and when you open it discs fall out.Other TV shows are in very nice boxes and this one isjust not worth buying. I will not buy these sets anymore.
4,"It's Supposed to be Grainy, People!","I knew Burn Notice was going to be a hit long before it aired. The plot was wonderful, very original for television. Season one was a huge success as was the second. I love the series with the one exception being the grain.I don't like the grain very much, but I wish people would are complaining about the grain being in the Blu-ray would actually educate themselves on the issue. The grain is supposed to be there, whether we like it or not. If you don't like it, complain to the director of photography as he is the one who wanted the grainy look and feel to the show.Again, it has nothing to do with a bad Blu-ray transfer, it's the way the show is supposed to look. It's that simple.That being said, bring on more seasons. I'd love to replace my inferior DVDs with the Blu-ray."
1,Better to buy the DVD,"The problem with Amazon's ""Video On Demand"" system is that the downloads are not portable. First you have to download and install some software (Windows only, I believe) in order to view/download the videos, and then you can only view them on the PC they were downloaded to. With a DVD you could at least watch them in any DVD player and also watch them on your PC if you chose to do that. My computer monitor is not nearly as good as my television for watching video.Plus, I suspect that the resolution of the downloaded files is not nearly as good as on a DVD."
2,A-Team for today,"Fairly routine television with almost no situation having even a shred of semblance to real life. You might call it cartoon-ish, with a Miami Beach backdrop."
5,My new favorite show,"This is a fun show, with funny characters and funny captions. It seems like a tongue-in-cheek play off of 24 (which I also love), with the captions under people as they're introduced, the split screen action shots, and even some of the plot lines. The twists are unpredictable and the action sequences are realistic ad well done. Highly recommended."
5,In a word: AWESOMENESS!!!,"This episode in BN is by far one of my all time faves and thank goodness Amazon was there to allow me to purchase it!! Hot Michael, Clever-as-a-fox Sam and the devilishly gorgeous Fi take a gang of car thieves out head on! My fave quote: ""Plus, your place is on fire."" COuld watch that part over and over!!"
5,The best portrail of HUMINT and CIA in telivision.,This show is the best show I have ever seen when it comes to the reality of HUMINT operations and the CIA. The show is even more interesting because it deals with a burnt spy trying to get his job back at the CIA. Some situations Michael faces are a little over dramatic but still lie within the range of reality. If shows like Covert Affairs follow this example then tv and movies regaurding the intelligence community have the potential to become phenominal.
4,Burn notice review,I received this product in a very timely manner. I am well pleased with my purchase.
1,DONT BUY BLU-RAY GRAINY,The video is terrible on this blu ray there must have been a mistake made Very grainy I even changed the settings on my tv and my blu ray player no change in video. up date I wrote to fox blu ray and they asked me to send in my copy so i will update what happens with it. UPDATE Sending me another copy we will see what happens when I get it. UPDATE they sent me a new one and it was also bad and grainy. I DONT RECCOMEND THAT ANYONE BUY THE BLU RAY
3,Great Season - Skimpy Extras,Overall the show is fantastic. I really miss the care that was taken with the commentary in the Season One DVD set. In the previous season there was a lot of interesting tidbits with Jeffrey Donovan and Bruce Campbell. This time not so much.
2,Mesoscopic jargong,"If you need the vocabulary, the names, and the important references in the field of mesoscopic physics this is the book for you. If you want physical insight and understanding you must look elsewhere (god knows where?). All derivations start with some random non-fundamental formula and ends in another. Clarity and coherence seem far away."
2,A terrible book,"This book is definitely not written for grad students or anyone who is just interested in the field and wants to get an general idea of it. I'm sure the author could make the book little easier to read, but it seems he just did not want it that way."
5,An excellent book,"The authors have done a superb job of covering all corner cases that one might encounter while loading data in the database. The text is sprinkled with practical advise, do's & dont'sI am not sure if sqlloader development has kept up with the database development (i.e. if there exists a 10g version of the sqlloader to go with the 10g Oracle database). If so, then I wish they will come up with a second edition of the book."
5,Good intro to SQL Loader,This little book is a lifesaver. I have benefitted a lot from the examples provided in this book. SQL Loader can be hard but very easy if you have a guide like this book.
4,A Nice Introduction to SQL Loader,"This is a good book for anyone needing or wanting to learn more about SQL Loader. The book begins by laying the foundation for SQL Loader and discussing ""The Mysterious Control File"". After that it discusses the two types of files that can be loaded - fixed lenght and delimited files. With the basics covered, the authors turn to error recovery and advanced features such as selective loading and direct path loads. After reading this book, you should have a good idea of what SQL Loader can and cannot do along with some of the finer points of when to and not to use SQL Loader. A knowledge of Oracle SQL is really all that is required to understand the material presented. This book is a must have for any shop using Oracle for their database."
4,sophisticated,"I heard one track on an tv show and had to look it up immediately. I checke d out the album on Amazon and thought, what the heck, it sounds good.Turns out I was right.The album isn't really comparable to anything I've heard before.It's rich audio and cool vocals sit on a deep river of bass.Awesome music to calm you down, even better loud. I can't help feeling like it evokes the emotions of jazz--that smooth smoky sensuality.Great!"
4,Rating,I bought the cd for the song bloodstream and I absolutely love that song. There are a few other songs I like on the cd but some I do not.I would recommend that anyone listen to the song bloodstream. It is amazing.
3,A Mixture of Good and Mediocre,"I felt like Hogue didn't always connect his neurological concepts to his pastoral ideas, but rather would spend a fair amount of time on one or the other making only the occasional link between the two. Some of these links were significant and worthwhile, but I would have preferred that he spend more effort integrating the two topics.His section on ritual was potentially worthwhile, but I find that I only really understood it well after having read other works on the neurotheology of ritual such as D'Aquili and Newberg. Until then, I didn't feel like he made the connections clearly and didn't understand why he was making the points he did.It's a decent addition to a collection of works on how neuroscience is connected to theology, particularly practical theology, but I'm not sure it stands alone as a text."
5,Works well.,Works well for usage in infrared goggles.I don't know how well it would work when used as intended.
2,Kinzy and Flimsy,Kinzy and flimsy but I guess you get what you pay for. Very inexpensive but it shows. It works ok on small pots with not much in it but don't try to use on larger pots.
1,Not good!,Product does not stay secure on pots and flips off! Only tried on the large pot that I purchased it for.
1,Fitx-All Pot Strainer/Drainer,"Very disappointed! I should have know from the cheap price but it DOES NOT fit all pots - only my smallest pan, and there is no way to adjust the width."
3,Smart device...,"Disclaimer: I don't own this, but am about to buy one to replace a very old, similar product.But understand that the product will ONLY work on pots with a sharply defined lip. It holds its grip with a curved edge, but must have something to grab onto. It will certainly flip off off a pot with a very straight edge. Be warned."
3,An interesting book.,"The book is accurate in its descriptions and data for the different structures and methods of construction of ships. The only observation I would like to make is regarding the editing: The absence of comas, colons, etc. Being this a book full of references and standards of contruction, in some paragraphs, the sentences are not well structured, making the reading difficult."
3,What! No Bags!,"It has powerful suction, but I can't find replacement bags anywhere. You shouldn't have to go to so much trouble locating bags. They should be offered with the vaccuum cleaner. The cleaner easily tips over when using, and all the attachments fall out. The hose doesn't seem to be long enough, and there should be a better handle to hold on to."
1,Weak Sell,"What a waste of time. I usually find at least one ""nugget"" of useful information in even a bad or formulaic book but this book is poorly written, unorganized, and is either outdated in it's ideas or just flat out wrong.Do yourself a favor and skip this."
4,Soft Sell: A Good Book on the Fundamentals of Selling,"The first half of the book is more about motivation than traditional sales literature. Most of which is solid knowledge on goal setting and motivation.The sales portion is oriented towards the novice but a good read even for an experienced sales consultant as it's always good to focus on the fundamentals.This was my second read in several years and it's a book I would recommend for the general non sales public and anyone new to sales.Title is a bit misleading.John HalloranCertified Gold Exchange, IncOn facebook /certifiedgoldexchangeOn Twitter /cgeinc"
5,"Exceptional Sales Resource, Highly Recommended","SOFT SELL is an exceptional sales resource for both the new and experienced selling professional. Each easy to follow chapter reminds me of things I know, but don't always do, while encouraging me to get back on track. Tim has done an excellent job providing a step-by-step approach for sales people at all levels."
4,Great!,"This text book contains all the necessary information needed for the study of such a complex subject! It's good for undergrads like me, but a more detailed approach is needed if a masters student is to use this book. Burns & Bottino presents to us a systematic discussion of the field of Genetics and in laymans terms, then shifting to technical terms, enables us to understand what the concepts mean and imply."
5,Favorite Cookbook in Our Kitchen,"I recently read that people make an average of only 4-5 recipes from most cookbooks. To date, I've made 17 from this wonderful collection and look forward to trying many more. The directions are clear, the ingredient lists accurate, and the photos are as delightful to the eye as the dishes are to the palate. In addition to the many meze (little dishes), main courses, and soups, the author shares her wide-ranging knowledge of local Greek cuisines and the characteristic flavors of the Greek kitchen. A true classic!"
5,Great Greek Vegetarian Cookbook!,"This book includes many recipes for classic Greek vegetarian dishes. Many people don't realize that because of the extensive dietary restrictions of the Orthodox religious year Greek cooking has developed a huge and mouth-watering vegetarian repertoire. Everything looks and sounds delicious and authentic. The recipes are clearly written and don't require many exotic ingredients. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm always interested in finding tasty non-meat dishes to vary the daily menu and this cookbook delivers on that! The recipes in this book are ovo-lacto, but many of them can easily be adapted to vegan cooking. I definitely recommend this book! With recipes like these, meat really becomes irrelevant -- these dishes are all intrinsically good in and of themselves!"
1,The Greek Vegetarian,"I ordered this book from Amazon and was so much looking forward to cooking from it. In my opinion, most of the dishes seem like side dishes, and they call for unusual ingredients that I would not consider Greek, like Brussels sprouts, and wild rice. I know that this book states that the recipes are inspired by the traditional recipes of Greece, but in my opinion, they were just not ""Greek"" enough! I much prefer :From a Traditional Greek Kitchen: Vegetarian Cuisine (Healthy World Cuisine)By andGreek Vegetarian CookeryI found both in my local public library along withMediterranean Vegetable CookeryRena Salaman is Greek and perhaps her recipes are a little more traditional than the ones in this book. I do like Diane Kochilas'The Glorious Foods of Greece: Traditional Recipes from the Islands, Cities, and VillagesI find the recipes there are excellent, and there are plenty for any vegetarian to enjoy."
2,The greek vegetarian,"The book disappointed me, in that it did not have very good selection of true Greek vegetarian dishes, a great deal of dishes listed I never heard of, or ever seen. That aside some of the dishes seem to be middle eastern and not Greek at all. Disappointed with the book, that tried to create original receipts using Greek ingredients, but ended up really failing on both."
1,This is even worse than the other cookbook of hers.,The trash is too good for this book. It was a waste of my time and money. I can't imagine that this person has ever cooked in her life.
2,i prefer Kremezi's Greek Island cooking book instead,"Diane Kochilas says and I quote,""There is a certain elemental quality to all the cooking of Greece that seperates it from the cooking to the east and to the west, that is from the cooking of Turkey on one side and of Italy on the other.""I am a gourmet cook and I don't know what Kochilas is talking about in terms of Turkish cooking. The Greek foods are heavily influenced by the Turkish cooking in fact it is hard to find dishes that are NOT shared by these 2 countries on either side of the Aegean. Many recipes in this book have Ottoman Turkish origins. Yet the author denies any Turkish influence. Sour grapes, Diane????? I think so."
1,Broke after a month and a half,"If I could give this zero stars, I certainly would. We didn't have this massage table for 2 months when it literally BROKE IN HALF. The client sat up, and it split in half. The clients was not big by any means...I should have known that the price was too low...but I fully expected it to last a year...So angry."
4,Good quality bad smell,I just got this table and it is fantastic quality for the price. It works great.Only thing is it smells like gasoline. The off gassing from the foam is horrible. It isn't a problem for use as the sheets and candles mask any odor but for the last 3 days when I come in the room first thing in the morning it is thick. I can only hope this passes with time.
3,"Thin pad, but otherwise good.","Does it really cost a bunch more to give this a slightly thicker pad? It is a decent table, but it is a little hard. I suppose some people might prefer that, but I want something that cushions me a bit and supports my back when I am on my stomach when getting a massage."
2,mold on underneath of bed,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY SALON. WHEN WE OPENED IT THE UNDERNEATH WAS MOLDED. I RETURNED IT AND HAVE NOT GOT MY REFUND YET. I HAVE TRACKED ITEM AND THEY RECIEVED IT. SO IM STILL WAITING. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.
4,Does the trick,"I have some heavier clients and the table doesn't SOUND as sturdy as my other table, but I've put approx. 300 lbs. on it and hasn't collapsed. The good news is it comes with 2 half bolsters, a little rack, and 2 extensions for your client's arms. It looks nice, comes in a carrying case and is light. For the price it was well worth it!"
3,Only so-so,"The table is about what I expected for the price -- cheap. I can deal with that. Just need something to get me through a couple of years. However, the carrying case is a piece of junk. Not only is it nearly impossible to put the table into the case (or more accurately, wrap the case around the table), on about the third time I picked it up by the side handle it ripped right off. Just a few stitches of cheap cotton thread holding it on. While I'm here, I'll mention that I don't expect the dinky little zippers to last long, either.UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer on 6/20/11, the day I first wrote this review update, and got an almost immediate response -- they sent me a new carrying case that arrived 6/22. So my feelings on about the purchase are still mixed, but I am for the most part satisfied."
3,gave me back problems,"Was not pleased with this purchase. I am an esthetician using it to do facials, waxing, and body treatments on. And it gave me more back problems and it just did not feel right. Surface felt hard instead of smooth."
4,Sierra Portable Massage Table,"The table arrived in excellent condition directly to my front door in a short period of time as promised. It did not, however, have any written information at all, not even an enclosed receipt. There were a couple items in regards to setting up the table that I would have appreciated knowing how to do, as simple as it may look. Excellent offer from Amazon, much appreciated results."
5,"Great table, great price.",Came perfectly on time and seems to be a great sturdy table with great accessories like the carrying case and bolsters.
3,Not enough padding,"I helped my massage therapist get a new table to quickly replace her table that had broken. This came quickly. It was lighter than her old one so it was easier to carry. However, the padding is lacking. If you roll over, it is painful to the hips. I noticed this as did her other clients.It did work for the time she needed to buy a better and more comfortable table. The price is right but should only be used in a pinch due to the lack of comfort provided by the table top padding and the face piece padding."
4,Sierra Comfort Professional Series Portable Massage Table,"great massage table,like the arm rests and ajustable head rest,seems to be holding up well,easy to set up and take down, lite enough to move around"
4,Perfect for students,"I bought this product as a gift to my girlfriend, who is studying massage. We love it! The construction is quite sturdy enough to hold my 200+ lbs, but I would not go jumping about on it. It is quite comfortable. It may be slightly narrow for larger people such as myself, but adding the armrests adds more than enough. Overall, I think that for the money, this product is great. I don't know if it's appropriate for long, hard professional use, but it seems perfect for students."
1,JUNK!,Never again will I buy this product. More cheap Chinese crap. Cracked after third customer! How are we supposed to get our money back?
3,frustrating face cradle,"The face cradle is not as pictured, it is a sharp edged ply-wood ""C"" mounted on metal arms. The finish on the metal arms is uneven and ""lumpy"" on one arm and it wont fit into the hole at the end of the table. Once I was able to force it into place, I had to sit on the ground and brace the table with my feet in order to pull it back out. Also, the face cradle moves once positioned and tightened... and Ive yet to find a way to avoid this. It has one adjusting mechanism for two arms, and there is a lot of give once in place. The wood on the table is unfinished, not a big deal just letting you know what to expect. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if not for the face cradle. I cant even find a link on the order to contact the seller about this?"
2,Not for heavy use,"I purchased this table for my acupuncture clinic because I liked the arm extensions. Unfortunately, within 5 weeks of the purchase, one of my heavier patients merely turned from supine to prone and we heard an immediate crack. Inspection revealed a 5 inch crack in the center of the frame. Amazon was great about taking back the item. Another note is that the padding is pretty meager, so I used extra padding. If you can invest another $100, I recommend going for something more sturdy and well padded."
2,Has a strong smell wood material is cheap,"I bought it, and all day long it has a smelly cheap leather smell, the wood material will make cracking noises as I lay on it. I wouldn't trust this message table for long term use, so I returned it."
2,I wish I looked a little further.,The table cracked when I put the first person onto it. He is 330lbs but it is supposded to handle 120 lbs more than what he is. I am not happy at all. Now in order to return it I have to either pay the shipping or find something to put it in to return it since the box was so dammaged! Looks like I will just have a table I can not use.
3,Nice table but cheap headrest...,"Just received this table this morning. Set up was incredibly easy, did it myself within 30 seconds. The only problem was the head rest, I read the reviews saying that it was flimsy. Well everyone was right. Just to see I laid my head in it, and had my boyfriend slightly push on it so I could see how it would hold up with the working weight, and with a light touch on my head the head piece cracks and falls. I was hoping it would hold up for at least one massage. Guess not. The rest of the table seems great, very sturdy, pretty comfortable padding. So I'm sending back the headrest, lets hope the next one will come through quickly and be a little better quality."
3,No bolsters,"The table as advertised said it would come with two free bolsters which were not included. The table is comfortable and sturdy enough but the box it was packaged in was badly damaged and had been greatly re-taped (I'm assuming at the shipping warehouse. Fortunately, the table was not damaged."
2,poor quality,"I ordered this table for Reiki. The fact that it does not give a ""Working Weight"" concerned me a little, but I thought for the price, it should be able to have enough support for no true working force. Not so, it creaks & cracks when you get on or turn over & this is on people between 150 - 200 lbs!! the seams on the corners make it look cheap, the attachable accessories also look & feel cheap. I guess you get what you pay for, but overall, I am disappointed."
5,Massage table,"I am very pleased with the quality of this product, especially in view of the price. It is very easy to set up, take down, store, and move around. I would highly recommend it for home use."
2,"Head Rest Sucks, Otherwise OK","You really do get what you pay for, which is a cheap, functioning massage table. My wife and I wanted to give each other massages, and it works fine for that. The height options are good, and it is pretty stable (we're of the skinny persuasion, however).My big beef, and the reason I'm knocking two stars, is that the head rest majorly sucks. You can only angle it, but you can't raise it up and down. But it holds your head too high, which puts a strain on your neck, and there is no way to lower it. You have to just angle it down as far as you can, but if you angle it too far your chin ends up on the horizontal bar. It's a frustrating affair and makes it hard to get your head at a comfortable angle. Can't believe they overlooked this when they designed it."
4,Quite Good,"The table is what I expected. It's been put to good use so far, durable, easily portable, and has worked real well for client customer and masseuse. The only minor thing I would say that isn't top rating on it is where the arms rests are placed and the hanging arm rest for hands, its not the greatest position, doesn't really stay put, and have to attach and detach (yes, the other parts are like that too but simpler). But, I hardly use it and there isn't a need for it so it's not a big deal. Just figured I mention it if its a necessity for some people. Again, it has worked real well and quite happy with it. Thank you."
5,well done,appears very sturdy and well made. I think this will last a long time and work like I had hoped.
5,Sierra Comfort Professional Series Portable Massage Table,"The Sierra portable massage table arrived on time and works and feels great !I love it a will recommend it to others .I shop with Amazon all the time and will continue.The only thing i would change it the arm rest , they could be built more sturdy ."
5,The Best,"My husband has been using this deodorant for over 4 years now, we had to import it from Germany since it wasn't available here at that time. He had developed a strong sweat odor and no deodorant we found here was able to completely stop it. Not not mention some of the obnoxious scents they had. But Sebamed does the job, its scent pleasant and it is free of harmful chemicals and aluminum. It keeps him smelling good under the hot California sun all day long. I can highly recommend this product even if its cost is a bit high, it is well worth it."
2,A Poor Imitation,....of Ernest Holmes wonderful interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount. Pompous and egotistical.
4,One Song worth 12.99,"Being a big fan of Muse and having seen them live, I knew what I was getting when I bought this CD/DVD. I wanted to see the Video of Sing for Absolution and see what these guys could put together.The CD only has 2 songs Absolution and Fury. The song Fury is one of the best low bass songs I believe I have ever hear and if nothing else it alone was worth the $12.There is a depressing point of the DVD it is made overseas so I could not watch it on my regular DVD player and thus had to use my PC DVD player.All around great work again by MUSE!!"
4,"From Publishers Weekly, October 6, 1997:","""Riddle lovers will appreciate the not-too-tough questions posed (and answered by lifting the large flaps)..."""
5,How to become an informed partner with your doctor,"A bookfull of simple tests that don't require any special training or expensive equipment,but can tell you when your body systems are functioning normally and when you should consult a doctor. And when you do go to a doctor for a checkup, you can give him or her an intelligent and informed appraisal of what's going on. Tells you things your doctor wants you to tell him."
4,"Beautiful, but incomplete","There's no denying that this is beautiful collection of episodes from a well done series. They are ""neo-noir"" at it's best. Powers Boothe is among the best Marlowes. Regrettably this collection is incomplete. There were 11 episodes in the series and this collection only contains six. I don't know if this was preventable by Goldhil. I do know that three or four of those other 5 have been released on video at one time but have since been discontinued."
3,Enjoyable Series with Excellent Marlowe,"Indeed Powers Boothe is perhaps the best Marlowe and he alone makes the series totally worthwhile. All of the shows are enjoyable but the supporting acting is very uneven. The first 4 shows of the series also show a very limited budget and the video transfers are not the best. However, if you can put these issues aside you are in for a treat as Philip Marlowe comes alive on the screen."
4,Philip Marlowe old style detective.,"The Philip Marlowe series is an old time radio show put to film. The only thing wrong with the series is that there wasn't more shows. I have seen some other reports where people have complained about the music in the introduction, personally I like the music. These shows were not supposed to take place in a modern setting. It would seem out of place to have a lot of loud rock and roll music.Although I have not watched the entire collection, there is another thing that I like about these shows is that there is not a lot of profane language in use. Some people seem to like the use of dirty language, but that is not what I like in a show. To me it takes away from the show, it is a detective show, not a swearing contest.Chris."
5,I wish there were more,Another great series that there is never enough of. Powers Booth plays a great Philip Marlow. The setting of 1930's L.A is superb and the stories are excellent. This was another series I only wished they had made more of and it would be nice to find season one on DVD or VHS.
1,Not closed captioned,"Since this was an HBO production I assumed, incorrectly, that they would be closed captioned but no, they are not."
2,Good Noir sabotaged by bad sound,"Without doubt, Powers Boothe is Philip Marlowe! The stories are good, the dialogue is snappy, the productions not bad at all. But...for the price, the sound is awful. Buyer beware. These discs should be recalled and replaced. In this digital age, for a DVD to get by with such sound means someone is out to rip you off. Do not buy this set. What a shame!"
3,Beware deceptive picture!!!,"I purchased this after not fulling reading every detail of the product description. Although the picture here shows a full set of various cold packs this is actually for Just 1 single 11 x 14 pack , which also doesn't even appear to be any of the ones shown here....its similar to the one in the bottom left of the pick but is a little wider and not as tall.It works pretty well , I would give it 4 star if the description and picture was better!I will attach a pic later myself and I will see if there is a way to report that picture as false advertising because it is not what you are getting here!!"
2,Not as pictured,I suppose these work but I assumed that I was receiving a kit but only received two pieces. Careful reading and the price should have warned me. My mistake. I didn't realize these requied padding. I was far more pleased with the ActiveWraps.
5,Great Product,"These Colpac products are great. I have the 11 x 14 and the neck pack. I recently had one break, but it had been handed down to me. I'd guess it was used moderately for 3-4 years. These get really cold and I haven't seen a better product on the market."
4,Chattnooga Colpac,The Cold Pack was everything as advertised and much less expensive than from a medical supply company. I ordered two cold packs to aid in my wife's recovery from hip surgery. They functioned very well.
5,Couldn't ask for a better cold pack,This Colpac Cold Therapy blue vinyl cold pack can be molded to conform to various parts of the body. It can be used where cold therapy is needed. The vinyl is durable. One in a different size purchased several years ago shows no sign of wear. I would recommend this size as for its versatility and ease of putting in a freezer to chill it.
3,colpac 11x14 review,Product is durable and covers the entire knee by being big enough to wrap completely around. No more strategically placing smaller ice packs. This is the same kind my PT office used which is why I chose it. I love that the gel is super flexible I just wish it would stay cold longer.
5,chattnooga colpac,This is the best ice pack I've ever used. It gets cold quickly and stays cold for longer than any other ice packs I've used.
2,Leak after 4-6 months,"Have finally decided after owning 4 and 3 have gotten leaks, that we need to look at another brand. Really liked the feel but just not durable enough. We don't put stress on them. In the freezer, on the back, then into the freezer. Should last longer!"
4,"Great cold therapy, could use better construction","I've used these kinds of cold packs for years - ice is the only thing that helps my neck and back pain. These are nice and heavy so they get really cold (this is the same style that physical therapists use/sell). If you are not used to this type of cold you may need a towel or two between you and the pack at first but you will get used to it.My only complaint is that the seams are poorly constructed, and after a while they burst and brown goo oozes out. However, I have found a solution that I used on my most recent purchase, and it's still holding up 1 year later. Before you ever put the pack in the freezer, use electrical tape to reinforce all the seams. This is the only thing that helps! It's too bad that you have to do this, but it really works and it's worth the few minutes that it takes to do this."
3,"Nearly perfect, but they don't last long enough","These have been a godsend for me for years. Unlike other cold packs, these stay flexible when they're frozen. This means I can wrap them around my ankle or knee and they make very good contact with the skin the whole time.But then, after a few months they always rupture and leak. And they break on indented/recessed seams, where it's impossible to patch them with any kind of vinyl patch kit. I just have to throw them out.For now I think it's worth it, and I just replace them when they break. I usually get a couple years of occasional use out of them first. But if any competitor came out with a similar product that had better durability they would have my business in a heartbeat."
1,2 out of 3 started leaking in 5 months,Very thin material that tears under normal use. This is not a heavy duty product and I have no idea where to request replacements under the one year warranty.
4,It's OK,Does what it is supposed to. Will keep a nice cool for a while and will do the trick. I have not had any problems with the seams coming apart as some reviews have mentioned.
5,Chattanooga Colpac Cold Therapy - Blue,Just what my husband needed after complete hip replacement surgery. He used it a lot. Still like new. Great item.
5,cold pac,Best cold pac on the market works very well and is also very durable. Only thing you gotta watch for is using it on bare skin right when it comes out of the freezer.
4,As advertised,"I have not used this item yet. It is like ones I've had in the past. It keeps cold for a long time and flexible to mold it to the neck, back."
5,Helps the pain,I had shoulder surgery and needed to ice it afterword. This cold pack worked well. The pack came just in time!!!
2,Busted and leaked within 3 uses,"I have tried a lot of ice packs, and they always start leaking at the seams over time. I usually get about 6 months of regular use out of them. Of course, I just toss them in the freezer folded in half, often put weight on them when I ice certain parts of the body, and I tie something across them to hold them in place with some pressure. So, it seems reasonable that they won't last forever, but I doubt anybody else wants to treat their ice pack like fine china. I've tried a few different brands, but went with this one because it had good reviews for holding together. Nope, it was the worst one I've ever tried. It was not able to withstand much at all before it started oozing ALL OVER. At least the others would just ooze a tiny bit and I could throw duct tape over the tiny hole, this one was not repairable. Prior to breaking, it was great! Nice and cold!"
4,Ok...,"I got this icepack as I use them a lot for my back and I like the larger ice packs and wanted something on par with what I get while at the chiropractor. I picked this one because of the great reviews, but I am kind of disappointed with. It is a good solid ice pack that will last for sometime, but it does not seem to get as cold and last as long as other ones I bought from a local department store. I like the increased weight and it is a little more flexible than my old ones.If it got a bit colder and lasted longer, I would have gone with a full 5 stars."
2,Not what it seems,"I ordered the ice packs thinking it would be what was shown on the link. 7 pieces, rather I only received one of the 7."
1,Poor quality,"This is a poorly designed product. After a few months, the gel inside the pad clumped together and hardened. What a waste of money, these guys should be ashamed of themselves selling this garbage for top dollar."
5,"Bad Back, Great Ice Pack","I always used those little rectangle ice packs for my aching back. Then I went to Physical Therapy and they have these ""big boy"" ice packs. So I cam home and immediately got on Amazon and sure enough there were all sizes of ice packs. I got the 11x14 and it's perfect. I keep it flat in my freezer and either tie it on to my back or just sit with it between my back and a chair. I wish it came with a cover of some sort but I love having a big ice pack and not having to keep moving the smaller ones around. Delivery was fast and timely and no complaints with that!"
1,miss leading,I ordered al these coldpacs and all I got was the 11/14' . I'm loving the colpac I recived. But I want the rest of the items I paid for...Very miss leading.
5,Colpac Cold Response,Colpac Cold blue vinyl pack is excellent in every detail and accurately advertised. I use it on my back in daily physical therapy exercises. It is convenient and is a bargain at the price.
4,11 x 14 is perfect,"The 11 x 14 is really a perfect all-around pack for knee, back, neck, etc. We've been using it daily for several months and it has held up well."
4,Great Cold Pack For Knee,I bought the Cold Pack - ColPaC Brand - Blue Vinyl 11x14 to use after knee surgery. The first one arrived with a small leak. Amazon sent the replacement overnight. Talk about service!I have been using the cold pack daily for a month now. It freezes quick and lasts long. Perfect for my knee.The new one works wonderfully. I am very happy with it. 5 stars for service 4 stars for the product. Only because of the leak. Accidents happen and I understand when they do.
2,"Skip this ""Portrait""","Although the Cambridge singers always perform beautifully, this is not a beautiful album. The selections vary from sacred to secular, from a capella to full orchestral accompaniment--so it's hard to sit and listen to this as a program of music. The sound quality sounds like someone pushed the ""reverb"" button on an old electric guitar amplifier. If you're looking for a Cambridge Singers album, I'd start with ""Hail Gladdening Light"" ASIN B0000031HJ, and then go on to ""Faire is the Heaven"" ASIN B0000031H7 by the same forces. Both are collections of English Church music that are more even and are programmed more logically."
1,SO SAD I PUT THIS PRODUCT ON MY DANE PUPPY!!!,"I just wanted to keep the dog smell out of the house so I picked this product because it seemed to have good reviews. Now my poor great dane puppy's coat is dry and he has dandruff. He even started to cry when I put it on him because it contains ALCOHOL, which will burn if he has any open cuts or sores. I had NO clue. I thought he was just being whiny. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! It says ALL NATURAL, making you think it's safe but ALCOHOL will only hurt your dog. Very disappointed."
5,spray,help with allergies for us animals lovers and we wat ot keep ouroved pets close to us and nve let them go
4,seems to work,"we dont have to use it too often. during the summer months I felt like our wire haired pointer was smellier than normal. this did help a lot to neutralize the smell. Since we arent allergic i cant speak for the dander part. Now that its colder he doesnt smell as much, but I guess it would work fine in between baths."
1,meh...,"What a disappointment this product was. I was so hopeful that this would help reduce my allergies to my cats, especially paired with the allergy reducer spray. It did not. Like the other nature's miracle product I purchased, at least it smelled ok and dried quickly."
5,Works great!,"I have been almost unable to breathe at home lately because of our two huskies. I bought this and as soon as I applied it to the dogs, I was able to breathe again. I'm amazed."
3,How do you go about hiring a burglar?,"When Bernie's dentist, Dr. Sheldrake, asks him to burgle his ex-wife apartment, what a guy to do? Supposedly, Crystal has a stash of jewels that her husband wants back. Unfortunately, while Bernie is searching the apartment, Crystal comes home early. Bernie ends up getting locked in the closet and once he manages to get out, finds Crystal dead on the floor with a dental instrument stuck in her chest. Now Bernie must find out what happened to the jewels while trying to avoid being accused of murder himself when his dentist, Dr. Sheldrake, points the finger at him to take suspcision away from himself. An amusing read that reqires some thought since there are several other key players in the mix."
4,"Lawrence, Meet ... Lawrence","If you miss Lawrence Saunders, then meet Lawrence Block. His series reminds me a lot of Saunders' Archy McNally, except that Bernie's on the other side of the law!! But the gist is the same, bachelor, swinger, funny, and always entertaining. In this installment, he steals jewels,which are stolen from him, doesn't kill someone the police think he killed and sleeps with a girlfriend that ain't his. But he puts everything (well, almost everything) back into balance by the end of the story, though he doesn't get the jewels or the girl. A good read, and an entertaining plot that doesn't give itself away until the very end, it will make you want to get the rest of Block's series. Easy going fiction."
1,Does not work with windows XP,Dont waste your money.Its sad that a program with 2006 in the title doesnt cleanly work with the typical operating system used in most computers in 2006. The program will not load at all. The web page promising support was not helpful at all. I tutor math and was looking for material to use to assist students. There is no way I would hand a child this frustration. Try instead the programs available at www.thinkwell.com
2,Solid but not quiet,"While this is a well built PS, don't be fooled by the ""silencer"" moniker. It's not silent by any means. I bought it to replace an Antec TruePower that I thought was bad and was disappointed at how loud the fan was.There are too few power connectors, but I have many devices, including an extra case fan. This PS does not appear to control fan speed. It may have some circuitry that quiets itself, but it did not manifest itself while I had it installed.I took it out and sold it elsewhere. Bought another Antec, which has PS controlled ""fan only"" power connectors."
4,Power Supply Replacement,The power supply fit perfectly into the E-Machince computer. The information at their web site provide some very helpful information about the differences in power supplies. I would recommend the company.
2,A Dream that did not come true!!!!,"My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts.We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny."
1,Disposal Ad Wrong - Item NOT needed,The information on the Waste King Disposal page was wrong - I did NOT need this item or the Disposal Adapter. Now I'm out an additional $18.00 for no good reason.
1,Amazon suggested it,I didn't need this part. Be careful what Amazon suggests you will need. I will cost me more to ship it back and is more expensive than one from Lowes or Home Depot
5,Not really necessary with my disposer!,"Purchasd this item as a ""suggested purchase with my disposer..."", when in fact I had the item in the from my existing disposer and didn't really need a new one. The ""didn't really need a new one"" was expressed by my plumber who would have happily installed it."
3,Didn't need it,"The product was probably OK, I just didn't need it. Sorry that Amazon prompted me to order it."
5,This is Bigger Than Life,"Seldom seen home video footage, newly-released interview captured shortly before his death, footage of the crime scene, and recollections from such close friends and collaborators as Easy Mo Bee, Raekwon, Ditty, and Method Man, this comprehensive portrait of a hip hop superstar will have fans dusting off their old copies of Life After Death for another, nostalgic listen. Jason Buchanan"
3,Biggie Movie,This movie was a bit more interesting then i expected because it goes throughout the whole story of big and not just the commercialized stories the public always display
1,Notorious B.I.G.:Bigger Than Life,"Good for the BIG fan,tells his side of the story and a look back at his life which ended tragically sadly. I am not a fan of him or his music so I am biased however this should appeal to his fans even if the casual ones or the so-called backpackers."
5,Wonderful and Inspirational!,"I love this book, it is full of creative and beautiful patterns that can be adapted to make many other things. My favorite are the 4 lace hanger covers! There are a lot of edgings for tablecoths, napkins, hankies, towels, sheets, pillowcases, curtains and more. There is an amazing bedspread, a pomander, preserve covers, doilies, a basket cover, and so much more I can't remember it all. A lot of the table covers and even doilies, could be adapted to make baby blankets and shawls! It's just such beautiful lace, I love looking through the book again and again. The materials for the projects are easy to come by as well."
2,"Traditional Lace Knitting, Second Edition","What a complete disappointment. I love lace knitting and have been doing it for decades, but this is a travesty...a waste of time. For having been printed the first time in 1997 (11 years ago), just think about your grandma's house from the 1950s and that is what you will get...everything dripping in lace.Now, don't misunderstand me, there is nothing wrong with towels, pillowcases, napkins, or placemats having a little bit of hand-made knitted lace attached. But I draw the line at doing all of that work for a wine bottle cozy, lace clothes for freaky looking dolls, or preserve jar covers. It's just too over the top.There are better lace books out there. Barbara Abbey's ""Knitted Lace"" being one of the best. ""Heirloom Knitting"", ""First Book of Modern Lace Knitting"", and a few others. If you really want to look this book over check it out of your local library before spending the money."
3,"Stylish, works, gets in the way of some open chords","It looks nice, and it clamps down just fine, so far has loosened its grip, but ironically, since I bought this because of its low profile, it turns out to get in the way of open B7 chords.I can't remember if the thin black capos that every body has do the same thing. SO, I can recommend this, if you understand that it will make some open chords difficult."
2,Gets weaker after about a month.,"This capo was great for the first few weeks I had it. I then realized that the spring inside it became a lot weaker, and loose.Now it is difficult to get it to hold down the low E string."
4,It is pretty good!,It is really good and it provides a really good and firm grip. You won't regret getting it for this price.
5,Dunlop Capo,"Excellent capo for my electric guitar.Great quality,buy it now,you won't have regrets about this buy.Now i can play Hotel California."
4,Easy to Use,I was a bit hesitant to buy this capo because I had read a few reviews stating that it was a bit hard to open. I did not find that to be the case. It was very easy to use and good quality.Thanks for a good quality product!
1,Terrible. Just falls apart.,"I use capos a lot and this one was one of the worst.At first, it worked well. It fit comfortably in my hands when moving it, etc. Then the side caps came off repeatedly until finally they were lost and every time I went to put the capo on my guitar, it exploded! There is one large spring in the hinge that keeps the tension there. without the caps on the sides it just falls out. Terrible defect."
3,Not for kids,"The product seems to work well and does its job, but requires adult hands. I bought this for my 11 year old son. He uses both hands and still can't get it on and off cleanly."
4,Works fine,"Not the prettiest capo out there but works fine and I like the texture of the almost rubber padding and the price is good. Love the ease of using a squeeze capo as well and not having straps or screws to deal with. Takes a little practice to clamp without pulling the strings out of place, but I've had similar issues with other capoes..."
5,No Frills Easy Capo,"What can I say? Its a solid aluminum capo, its not going anywhere anytime soon. Its easy to take on and off, no buzz, solidly built. Will last forever"
2,Not for 12 String Guitars,"Regardless of what the package advertises as for 6 or 12 string, this capo does not function properly for a 12 string guitar. The spring is just to weak. It functions fine for use with a 6 string guitar."
5,Excellent product,"I wasn't sure how this Capo would work on a slightly curved neck as my guitar has. However, it works fine. It holds the strings evenly and is easily installed/removed. Great product!"
5,Great Capo,"It has a tight grip, it's simple to use and it gives a clear tone when used.I am a huge fan of Kyser (which is what I use on my guitar) but I bought this for my sister... and I'm kind of jealous I didn't keep it for myself. It preserves the original tone better, and it's cheaper."
3,Stiff but tough,"This is a solidly constructed bit of kit. It doesn't feel like its going to break any time soon. I've used it on my electric and acoustic and it works very nicely on both. Good cushioning ensures no marks or scratches even if you're a little rough taking it off. On the down side, it is very stiff to open. I had hoped it would ease up with use but is still taking no prisoners. I often have difficulty getting it onto the guitar. I would not recommend this if you are buying for a child, elderly or not so strong in the hands. I would also not recommend it if you are planning to use your capo on stage- it can lead to some embarrasing pauses whilst you wrestle with it!"
5,Works great for the price,"Works great on my Ovation acoustic/electric. As other reviewer's have said, you do have to squeeze it a little hard open it, but it's not really an issue. Most guitar players have well developed muscles in their left hand anyway."
5,7 Months and still works great.,"I know most people would look at this and think for the price it can't be that great. But it does everything a capo should do and well. I've had no trouble with it coming apart, and if it does, I guarantee I will replace it with the exact same one. You absolutely cannot go wrong for the price."
2,Good at first but then..,Might just be a weaker capo but at first it did its job then after awhile it stopped pressing down the strings so hard so alot of the times the strings viberate on the capo and it sounds really bad id reccomend going with kyser they are alot better
3,Kaypo,I bought this Kaypo after owning a kyser kapo for a while. I like the low profile but it's a little more difficult to position than the kyser is. It is solid when it's in place.
5,Great Capo,"This capo does the job and is very easy to use. This is coming from someone using an old stap-on style capo, which was just a pain to use and adjust. This clip on capo is very easy to use and adjust for anyone with any kind of hand strength. I could imagine this being a bit hard to use for anyone with arthritis or carpel tunnel, but playing guitar in itself would be a challenge with those ailments."
5,Perfect capo,"Easy on and off. Fits all 3 of my guitars. Looks good. I have one I have been using for over two years, every day that is still like new. I bought this one as a gift for a new guitar player. I recommend this capo."
5,Nice,"I love this capo. It is my first one, so i didnt really know what to expect. However, it is super easy to use and i like the way it looks (not at all what i was expecting)"
2,Works great but WARNING: might mark or stain your guitar permanently,"Dunlop trigger-style guitar capo, ""Electric Trigger""This capo works great, but it stained the neck of my vintage electric guitar. It put a dark round-ish spot in the middle of the back of the neck (and also small permanent marks on the headstock where I clamped it when not using it). From now on I will look for capos that have a better reputation for 'non-staining', and I will also remove any capo immediately after playing, to be safe."
5,IT FiT AND NO HURT THE STRING,IS very light and fit on my acoustic guitar very well.. dont hurt the string and chance my tones when i need it.. quality very well
3,It's okay...,"Although I like this capo and it seems very durable, there is only one problem with it. I agree with another reviewer about the capo getting in the way when playing certain chords. I have to place it at a slight angle to help avoid that problem when playing both my electric and acoustic guitars. Doing that doesnt alter the sound quality (that I can hear) but I don't want any complications when playing my guitar and having to comply with a capo is not doing me any favors. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner or a long time experienced guitar player either. I shopped around before I bought this capo and did because of the high remarks and the price. However, I'm sure there are other capos that will give you all the benefits you desire without any backlash. p.s I am an intermediate level guitar player. I know a thing or two but still have some things to learn."
5,Great for electric and works on classical too!,"Had mixed feelings after reading the review. Was worried the spring is really too strong for kids. Anyhow, it's been a week, and even my youngest daughter (skinny 4ft gal) can use it on her 3/4 classical guitar by herself. Yes, product details did mention this is meant for acoustic/electric but it works on my kid's classical too (maybe because it's a 3/4 size but I'm assuming the neck size should be the same on 4/4 as well.) Build quality is good and the padding doesn't scratch my guitar!"
5,Bargain. Works perfectly.,"This capo is exactly what I needed. Not too stiff at all. Yes it's firm, but that's kind of what you want. It's easy to place and easy to remove."
4,Works nicely...,Purchased this capo for my son's electric guitar. Works easily for his smaller hands. He is also able to use on acoustic. Versatile. Well built.
5,"Stong, sturdy, and fast","This capo replaced the cheapy, annoying elastic stretch band that came with my guitar. It was hard to get into position and also didn't sound nice unless you had it in the perfect position which took some time to get into position.This one hold the strings down better for a cleaner sound and also allows to move around a lot faster than other capo's I've owned.Great price as well."
2,Best Of Bukem,"I am a big fan of Bukem, but was disappointed to hear the same tracks on many of his CDs. If you have many of his previous releases bypass this disc. If you are new to Bukem this will be a worthwhile buy. I recommend Logical Progression sessions for his better stuff."
1,Wrong cd,Yeah. This is what I ordered but I received the album Earth. Which is really good. But can I have what I ordered sometime?
3,-=Low Key=-,"Personally, I found it meandering, dated and repetitive. And yes, I do like most types of drum & bass, but I found the newer tracks on this album more or less as evolved as ancient tracks like ""Music"" (also featured here.)Maybe try one of his 'Earth' series compilations instead."
2,LUCHA LIBRE FUN AND PRETTY SENORITAS!!!,MINDLESS AND CAMPY BUT FUN FROM THE 60'S!! EL SANTO AND JORGE RIVERO WITH A BUNCH OF PRETTY SPY GIRLS - AND WHAT WITH THE WOMAN THAT'S TRYING TO DESTROY THE WORLD - GET THE ACTION GOING!!!
5,"Photos, photos, photos...","This book is wonderfull. With dozens of photos for each bird, this REALLY helps an amateur identify a bird. The best in it's class!"
2,Book Too Clinical/Advice Dated,I found this book dull and boring. There was very little that was relevant to how real women live their lives. Instead of this book I would highly suggest readers try LaDawn Black's latest work - Stripped Bare 10 Tested Truths for Landing the Very Best Black Man - now this is a book that works!
1,Deceiving,"Can you imagine Frank Sinatra on a cd, but he does not sing at all. That is what you will find in this cd. Dick Farney is great when he sings and he does not sing one song in this cd. Deceiving."
3,Inconvenient to use - good quality - barely fits more than 2 suits,"The quality of the product is good . But its so inconvenient to put the suit inside due to the nature of the zipper.I gave it 3 stars for the quality and the price. The zipper extends only half way through , so its really hard to put a suit inside . The front portion is made of plastic and the back portion is covered with a thin mesh like clothing -so dust can enter the clothing !!!"
1,clothing bags,"product not as indicated in picture. can not see clothing through bag. otherwise no fuss, no muss. pleasure to do business with. arrived on time as indicated. no complaints to date."
1,An anti adoption agenda,"This book purports to be about reunion, but the authors clearly want to communicate their anti-adoption agenda.The authors offer some good suggestions on how to prepare for a reunion, but their overall philosophy toward adoption is harmful. They are clearly against adoption. They state that birthmothers are being wrongly convinced to give up the child for adoption. They believe that the child should always stay with the birthparents. This is wrong and could only lead people to second guess their decisions and will likely lead to unnecessary feelings of guilt. It is too bad that the authors chose to send this harmful message rather than to stick with the topic that their title suggests."
5,Decent litter and a Crackerjack prize!,"I use Marshall litter among others and find it to be just about right - not too dusty and very absorbent. It is denser than some of the others I've used.This time instead of the usual chew toy prize (that my ferrets don't like), I found my bags were jingly... I received little balls with bells inside! Cool!"
4,Excellent book!,"I plan to try the ""bundle method"" on my next trip to Europe. The checklists in the book are wonderful! Also, I like the list of travel resources at the back of the book.Suggestion to the author: Have a web page containing links and updates to the travel resources. Some stores may have added web pages by now, and others may have moved."
2,Good book for first time travelers,"I thought this book might have some good insights and tactical tips into packing better, but I'm left disappointed that it is full of long lists, and seems written for the first-time traveler. I am now traveling heavily in a new job, but have found little useful info here."
5,Great little book,This is a great little book with wonderful watercolor/colored pencil illustrations. Nice message about having to eat dinner before you get dessert. My 3 yr old daughter loves it!
5,Let the kids decide!,My 6 and 4 year old have made me read this book twice every night since we got it at the library. We are now buying our own copy and a few extras as gifts. Perhaps it is best not to preview books (except for appropriateness) and let the children decide what they like. My girls even argue over which of them gets to read it!
4,"good, but with an unfortunate choice of wording","My 3 yr old adores this book. She looks at it over and over and asks us to read it to her several times a week. the pictures are cute, the story is cute, and my only complaint is that the author chose to use the word ""hate"" at one point. Not a word I wanted to introduce into my kids vocabulary so early on."
5,Hillarious idea!,"Could you ever imagine the child you are about to feed to protest yet another dinner of candy? That happens in the world of Little Pea, who can't wait to rush through his candy to get to his wonderful spinach dessert! Pre and beginning readers will thoroughly love this awesome story and great illustrations.This is a fun story, and it just might be a tool in your arsenal to create a veggie lover at your table!"
4,I loved it but it didnt impress my 3 year old,"Cute story and adorable simple illustrations. Too bad it didnt hold his attention tightly enough, or maybe the reverse psychology message was still beyond a 3 year old."
2,Maybe better for grade schoolers,"Funny concept and great art but features a kid reacting to dinner with ""yuck"", ""blech"", etc...and the aforementioned ""Little Pea hated it all."" Probably not a big deal with grade schoolers who've heard all this and more already. But the reading level is closer to that of preschool."
5,"Adorable, funny - and addictive","My 2 1/2-year-old nephew had four different people read this book to him in one hour when we gave it to him. My 3 1/2-year-old niece had a screaming hissy fit when she was asked to close her new copy because it was time to go to bed, and she normally takes a while to warm up to a new book. I love Amy's writing, and have followed her since her blog days, so I'm not surprised this book is a slam-dunk."
5,Little Pea for the candy lover,If you have a child that loves sweets and hates candy...this is a great book. The pea hates candy and loves to only eat vegies. Very cute.
5,Little pea,I think little pea is like a great adventure. what would you think about this story? I hope you like this story because it is a great book and a great story for kids. My six-year-old grandson wrote this review.
5,Cutest book!,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter and now read this nearly every night to her. Unlike many other books that get this same frequent use, we haven't tired of it. It is very cute and has a funny underlying messege about finishing your dinner to get dessert. Illustrations are darling."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I will not order from this place again. What I got was not what the picture showed. When I emailed the seller, I was told that they cannot guarantee that the product will look like what I saw online. I read no disclaimer regarding this issue when I ordered it. I informed them that they had ruined the babyshower as now I have no centerpiece and the seller did nothing to try to help me fix the problem. I was told to return the item if I was not happy. No, I am sorry. No, let us try to fix it, NOTHING! This, to me is bad customer service. They could have at least said they would try to get me what i actually ordered in time for the baby shower."
1,Good idea - BAD products,"I'll admit, I should not rate this item because I do not own it. However, I feel compelled to say that one should *not* be giving a new mom something with a bottle. If a new mom is going to achieve the AAP recommendation to give breastmilk exclusively for six months, then she needs the total support of everyone around her to create a breastfeeding culture. Bottles (and by association, artificial infant formula) sabotage the breastfeeding dyad's relationship. Ok - I know pumped milk also goes in bottles...but seriously, there could have been WAY better stuff in this gift set. Better idea, make your own!! I would definitely include a tube of Lansinoh brand Lanolin, Lansinoh breast pads, and a copy of the Womanly Art of breastfeeding."
5,More information for the prospective Buyer...,"Liner notes...""If you wanted sly sophisticated adventure in the early 1960s you went to the movies to see Sean Connery's James Bond...or stayed home with ""The Rogues.""

1,Does not taste good at all....,"Got like a whole box of this stuff for pretty cheap. I mean the packaging was like in Sam's club on steroid. okay, it didnt taste bad, but definitely didnt taste good."
3,Unfocusedly anecdotal,"Mostly a collection of anecdotes flung together in the broadest categories. Don't expect to pursue any topic in a deep way. Some of the stories are incredibly interesting, but the lack of depth in the book leaves you wanting more than is delivered. Would not read again, but don't regret the time spent."
2,"Lacking in focus, but containing a few entertaining sidebars","It's a vast topic and one the author never quite manages to wrestle into submission. ""Poisons"" rambles all over time, space and varying poisons, often all within a single paragraph. For the most part, it's a frustrating read. The main problem is the author begins a topic and then digresses freely without ever truly completing his thoughts on either the main topic or his numerous sidebars.However, the book does have its moments. Those which come to mind are the gruesome end of George Washington and the discussion of whether the Black Death was actually bubonic plague or simply ergot contaminated rye. Essentially, the author presents a collection of anecdotes interspersed with a few facts and his own commentary. Sadly he can not refrain from injecting the poison of personal politics into the mix. Let all ye evil capitalists beware..."
2,Rambling and Disorganized,"I rarely feel compelled to write book reviews, but this book was so unusual that I felt I had to. ""Poisons"" has its interesting moments, but as several other reviewers have mentioned the author has an annoying habit of rambling and failing to follow through with topics that have been brought up. The analogy desribed in one of the reviews of throwing a stack of index cards with notes into the air and then randomly arranging them into a book is particularly apt. I almost didn't continue after reading the first chapter, which seemed almost like reading a pure stream of consciousness. The gray sidebars continue to confuse me, as there seems to be no rhyme nor reason why these passages were set apart from the main text. Granted the topic is broad in both its scientific and historical scope, and much of the information is good, but the lack of solid editing has made this book a chore to read."
2,I didn't like it.,"This is the only Giant Sand CD I've heard, so I'm no expert, but I didn't like it. Don't get me wrong, there are some sublime moments here but he/they let themselves down with some rough moments which are hard to understand. I guess you would have to listen to it, but imagine listening to it with a friend, enjoying the good stuff, and then suddenly it goes all guttural on you and your friend turns to you with that funny look? I don't mind accepting that the fault is more with me than Giant Sand, but I don't liker sudden surprises in my music - just keep it even, or more even than this anyway."
4,Very Entertaining,"My almost 3-year old likes Strawberry Shortcake and when she wanted us to buy her some movies she asked for Strawberry Shortcake. While looking through the choices my wife suggested to get this one. I thought because it was the original she would not like it because of the graphics back then, not as crisp, the language is not as toned down as today - I find that most of the cartoons growing up had language more for an adult to understand. So we bought 2 videos this one and another of the new version.She absolutely adores this version and prefers to watch it over the newer ones. She likes to sing along with the characters in their entertaining songs, and she likes to point out that Pie Man is a bad man.I have to admit that even I find this version more enjoyable. The graphics are old, the soundtrack is old, but the fun is fresh each and every time we watch it."
5,Peculiar Purple Pie Man,I grew up watching Strawberry Shortcake and had been looking for the original cartoons. The new Strawberry Shortcake cartoons are disappointing... I missed the Peculiar Purple Pie Man of Porcupine Peak. I'm thrilled that I could find him again on this DVD of my favorite childhood cartoon.
5,Strawberry the way I remember! :),I think I was more excited to have this movie for myself than I was for my 6 yr old daughter! Nothing is better than the classics.. I was thrilled to see it on DVD.. good quality and quick shipping :)
5,THIS IS THE REAL ORIGINAL 1980'S STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE,The is the real authentic original Strawberry Shortcake (SS) cartoon that was made in the 1980's. The Strawberry Shortcake 2000 year cartoons where she is wearing a straw hat and jeans is a joke...they should not even be allowed to call it Strawberry Shortcake- what an insult. It is a whole nother cartoon and characters it should be called something else and not associtated with such a classic as the true 80's Strawberry Shortcake classic cartoon. Growing up on SS I am thrilled the real deal on finally on dvd for the new generation to enjoy and appriciate. I hate those fake foney SS re-make new adventure millinium garbage. Buy the classic ones! All you 80's babies and Parnets of 80's babies know what I'm talking about.
5,"Old friends, new technology","These movies are GREAT!!! As a young girl I watched these same movies as tv specials, and then later on vhs. These stories are sweet, wholesome, and timeless. I am thrilled that now I can share these same movies with my little ones."
2,Not enough,"I bought this for $13.00 and it only has 2 episodes on it. It's not worth the price. I was expecting more episodes than 2. I would not recommend buying this. On the small upside, they are from the original episodes."
1,do not purchase,"This is an older version. The newer ones are far superior in terms of the quality if the cartoons, etc. My daughter, who loves Strawberry Shortcake, is not at all interested in this DVD."
1,Strawberry Shortcake,I was very dissappointed with this movie. The animation was stone-age and it had characters in it that have not been introduced to this new generation of Strawberry Shortcake lovers. If I had know what I was purchasing I never would have spent the money.
2,"Great songs, terrible quality","The songs are terrific, Danny kaye is wonderful, but the digital reproduction is awful. Some songs are just worse than what you'd expect to hear through a cellphone."
3,"Other than the Vietnam Memorial, I don't find the rest of her work nearly as interesting.","While I don't find the rest of her work nearly as interesting as the Vietnam Memorial, this video provides a lot of insight into her methodology. Great information for art students and art courses."
1,"great artist, lousy documentary","I don't know about the DVD edition... but this is one of the least interesting documentaries I've ever seen. Maya Lin herself is clearly a gifted artist, but this is a standard paint-by-numbers documentary. You don't learn anything you couldn't have learned in a magazine article, it doesn't exploit the film medium at all, there's nothing in the form of this documentary that couldn't be used in a documentary about any successful person.The fact that it won an oscar just shows how screwed up the Oscar selection process was at that time for documentaries."
3,3 X longer than it ought to have been,"why do documentarians need to pad their movies? this wouldve been a nice half-hour film about the building of the vietnam veterans memorial, but it gets lost in far less compelling side tales. truth be told: ms lin is just not a very compelling personality."
5,An Amazing Role Model for Young Women,"This is a documentary of an amazing young woman. I saw one of her landscape installations at U Michigan but didn't really know much about her. A friend of mine suggested that I watch this video. The first half of the video shows how she was selected for the Vietnam War Memorial and her vision for honoring fallen soldiers and visualizing the suffering involved when she was only in her early 20's. The second half shows her work on the Civil Rights Memorial in Alabama and her more recent works. This should be a MUST view video for young girls. It demonstrates courage, hardships, perseverance and belief in one's own vision despite ridicule from others and racial discrimination. My three children (16, 14, and 11) watched it with me and they really enjoyed learning about her."
5,"Listen, She's talking to us","When I first heard her story, I was eager to know more about her,and I borrowed the DVD from Toronto Library. Don't know why,I just want to cry. I always like philosophy and psychology,but never have such an experience that a person like her who canexpress her feeling, emotion, and understanding of life in such a simple,direct, deep and touching way.Her speech is as good as her art.Now I say to myself, listen! somebody is speaking.Courage to be true."
5,More than just a biography,"This documentary of Maya Lin is very good. She is best known for herdesign of the Vietnam Memorial. The bulk of this documentary tellsthe story of how she came to design it and the controversy that ensuedas a result of her design; this part is well worth the price of admission.An overall excellent documentary. Though it concentrates mostly on herworks and her relationship to them, there is a general lack of standardbiographical fare such as personal information and such, I didn't missthat.An excellent documentation of the Vietnam War Memorial and the controversythat developed around it. Less of a true biography."
5,inspirational,"I first rented this documentary, and loved it so much...I HAD to own it! I teach visual art at the high school level. This movie is a wonderful film to not only showcase women in the arts, but also to serve as an ""anyone can accomplish anything"" film."
4,Eye-Opening,"Very interesting documentary about the artist who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Shocking to watch her have to endure racist slurs from people who were presumably fighting for freedom, equality, and democracy in this foreign conflict."
5,Park Smart Garage Door Seal,The Park Smart Garage Door Seal which came with liquid nails fixed the problem we had with water getting into the garage whenever there was a heavy rain. An inexpensive solution to a problem that had caused problems for many years.
5,Park Smart Garage Door Seal,"VERY pleased with this product. Arrived quickly and came with 2 tubes of mastic that was not indicated on the website. Needed both tubes, barely enough, but it was an excellent commercial grade mastic that is holding very well. Highly recommend!"
5,Excellent Product,So far very satisfied!!! The quality of the material looks very good and it was very easy to install. The garage entrance looks great now!
1,Ripped off,"Beware. Most of the pictures showing the contents of this kit show that it comes with two tubes of adhesive. But when I got mine there was only one tube. One picture on Amazon shows the 10-foot kit in black with one tube but all other pictures, in other colors of the 10-foot kit show two tubes. I ordered gray. The picture for that showed two tubes. But I only got one. This is a classic misdirection typical of dishonest retailers. I was ripped off. Both Amazon and the supplier should be ashamed of themselves."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,We have had problems with our garage flooding every time we had a hard rain. We had a rainstorm in March that delivered 6 inches in one day. Needless to say we had to stay up all night mopping the garage to keep it from flooding the house! I ordered the Tsunami Seal the next week. We received it in two days and installed it according to the instructions. It was super easy and took about 2 hours to complete with two people. It rained 3 inches 3 days later and not a drop came in the garage. We were thrilled!!! No more flooding! We highly recommend this product. Thank you!
5,Heavy duty,"We tended to get a little bit of water under the garage door in heavy rain and wind.This fixed it.After 4 years, still holding up nicely."
5,Good product....,"Installation was easy, taking less than 2 hours. We have had 3 rain storms since I installed the door seals and no water infiltration. I would recommend this product."
4,they're baaaack!,"I only found out this past winter that a-ha had made a comeback in 2000. Even though the news was a little late, I was so happy to discover that one of my favorite bands from the 80s is back!! After falling in love with them all over again listening to their 2000 Minor Earth Major Sky album, I'm happy to say they've done it again. Their latest release is a catchy, symphonic melody. Morten Harket's falsettos are still as strong and clear as ever. Backed by a calming piano and strings, it's easy for this song to get stuck in your head all day - and that's a good thing! Because this was produced by Stephen Hague, best known for his work with New Order and the Pet Shop Boys, you can hear his trademark poppy beat in the background. I hope this gets its much-deserved airplay in the US! It's really a sweet, catchy song... worth a listen for any a-ha fan... and may even turn you into one!"
3,What do you expect for an LP they originally gave away,"It's dope, but when this originally dropped it was much like Talib Kweli's LP with Madlib... free and a download. Months later they pressed up copies and sold it in stores. Is it a follow up to the compilation? Well, not really. It's more of a companion to Chrome Children or to be viewed as an outtakes/b-sides compilation. It's good, but not great. I originally downloaded it when it dropped and at the time I liked it, but it wasn't anything I was going to go back to on a regular basis. I think ultimately this compilation was to keep the fans at bay so to speak, before other releases came out the following year. (Ruff Draft, Champion Sound Redux etc.)"
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this cd. I brought it first without listening to samples because I am a Madlib fan, and I have to tell you this one you should pass by. As stated previously in another review, it does sound like a Nintendo or Atari game in some of the songs, then the other songs are just not cutting it. I only really like one song - ""In the city"", and will tolerate a couple of the others. It hurts me to say, pass it by, or listen to it first then purchase if it is to your liking."
2,Don't buy this product.,"My girlfriend and I started using this product and within a few days large holes started to develop. The dong is made of ""jelly"" and contains phthalates, a harmful material that can poison you. Also the description of ""jelly"" leaves the materials used in dong not shown. Anything can be put in a ""jelly"" dong.The harness itself is not bad at all. Great for a first time buyer, however the straps cut in and rub to create discomfort."
3,"Eh, it's alright",Bought this because we didnt want to spend too much if I wasn't going to like it. The harness stays put but the dong flops out of the harness a lot. Def investing in something better but did okay for a first time user.
2,Sad life.,"I was required to read ""Thirteen Stories"" by Eudora Welty so I decided to read this book too. Big mistake. I had read this before ""Thirteen Stories"" so I didn't know her writing style. Her life is mainly about herself and her family. Most of her family is obsessed with reading. There was also one ""catastrophe"" in which her mother's books were in a burning house so someone went in to save them. Also Eudora went to a very strange school. She loved reading and was excited when she got her library card. She used to take out many books every time she went. Her grandparents were strange too. They lived on top of a hill and had a farm and a barn. I'm not saying anything bad about farmers but these people could not be understood. Believe me...this is not a good book!"
3,Capturing the Senses of a Delta Life,"Originally envisioned as three lengthy lectures delivered at Harvard in 1983, this short autobiographical book presents an intimate portrait of the seminal influences--memories and emotions--upon one 20th century author. With tender and respectful poignancy Welty shares the development of her intuitive powers as she analyzes the Confluence--an important word for her--of the rivers of thought and motivation which shaped and colored her characters over her collective literary output. In both her short stories and novels her characters exhibit similitude, yet may claim their own motivations and struggles for independence on the printed page--in a world where human interdependence is almost mandatory. A very readable kaleidoscope of one writer's early Southern lifestyle."
2,got nothing out of this,"First of all, I don't think Welty's stature as a writer is now or ever has been such that a memoir was called for, but fine. The thing is only about 110 pages.But reading this proved a total waste of time, at least for me. I just finished it, yet would be hard-pressed to name one interesting event or situation from the entire work. She does outline where she was living and when, and there are some characterizations of some relatives, but as for getting at the core of what made her want to write and how . . . this book has, believe it or not, little to say on that subject.Try Maugham's ""The Summing Up."" Now THAT book was everything this one should have been, and by a far more able writer."
4,2 Great Old Dogs Together,"The Album with George Jones and Merle Haggard is a great album.Both The Artists are still going strong.The Album incl. George Hits song by Merle and visa versa.The way they are singing each others hits with a lot of feeling underlinewe are doing with gigantic stars, and how much the newer artists have to learn, if they ever do. I have my doubts.On the album are also incl. 4 great new duets.If you haven't bought this album yet, then do.Best regardsErik TpholmDenmark"
4,Jones sings Haggard/Haggard sings Jones,"This was a stocking stuffer for my husband who is a huge Haggard fan. According to him, Haggard's renditions of Jone's song are better than Jones doing Haggard. But it was a winner."
3,A sadly ho-hum package,"George got the better of the deal in this package...The problem always is that when another artist sings a George Jones song, it still sounds like a George Jones song. And when George sings another artist's song, it also sounds like a George Jones song! I don't think ol' Merle picked good Jones selction to sing...Haggard has got a gruff, earthy style that he could have given to some of Jones's livelier stuff. Trying to sing the slow Jones standards makes Merle sound like a poor pretender. He does ok with The Race Is On, but other songs are a disappointment."
5,Wonderful guide for Teachers to help NLD and AS students,This book has been a great help for the teachers working with my AS son. It provides a subject by subject blueprint for modifying curriculum that makes it fast and easy for a classroom teacher to accomodate different learners. I've purchased a number of copies of this book because everyone in the teaching profession who sees it wants to borrow it.A must for parents working through the IEP process for their children--bring it to your meetings and make the team read it.
4,DEAR DUMB DIARY[AM I THE PRINCESS OR THE FROG ],Do you like dumb books? Dear dumb Diary [Am I the princess or the frog?] is for you. In this book Kelly doesn't want to eat her meat loaf but Mrs. Bruntford said she had to. You will have to read the rest to find out. Recommended for 7 year olds thru 13 year olds.by; Morgan
4,Is she a Princess or a Frog?,"Terra Kuhn,Dear Dumb Diary, am I the princess or the frog???The awards Jim Benton a 2011 Reuben Award in the category of greeting cards! Jim nonchalantly flips it over to read the price on the back.ABOUT THE BOOKT he girl turns into a frog.Isabella is mean to the girl.She ends up marrying a frog.Stinkers on a pin board for cute dogs.MY FEELINGSI FELT PUMPED ABOUT THIS BOOK.THIS BOPOK WAS AMAZING.I LOVED THIS BOOKIT IS A GREAT FANTASY!!!TEASERAT THE END OF THE BOOK IT TELLS YOU IF SHES THE PRINCESS OR THE FROG!!!MY FAVORITE PARTMy favorite part was when Stinker saw his make-out/chew-toy. (MAKE-OUT/CHEW-TOY PAGE 92+93)ABOUT THE BOOK(THERE ARE 148 PAGES in this AWESOME book!!!!I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR GIRLSBOYS MIGHT LIKE IT TOO THOUGH. PLEASE READ AND FIND OUT IF SHES THE PRINCESS OR THE FROG!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A really good and funny book,"This book is really funny, because there are a lot a twists. (A lot of things that you would not think would happen) I have never read a series that is so funny! So if you do get ths book you might want to get book # 1,2 first. This is a great book!"
5,~*These are the best books ever!!!!*~,(This is from my daughter.)I love these books and I am going to get everyone. I already have 2 and I read them over and over again. They are hilarious and so true to life. I suggest reading all of these books and I can't wait for them to make more!!!
4,VERY FUNNY!,"Do you like funny books? If you do, you should read this book. I really like the characters. They are really funny. Jaime is writing in her diary and saying bad stuff about Angeline. Also Jaime is saying that her mom's cooking is horrible. This book is not as good as the first two, but is still worth reading for laughs. I can't wait for the next one!"
3,smells great but doesn't last,This stuff smells great but it fades really fast. Whenever I wear it I ask people If they can smell it and no one ever can. Be prepared to reapply ever couple of hours.
5,......Manly Fresh Scent,This is not too overbearing. My brother received this for christmas and seems to like it just fine. I would definitely recommend.
3,Clean scent but doesn't last.,I love the scent of Echo by Davidoff but the trouble is it wears off super quickly.
5,A book every survivor of clergy sexual abuse should read.,"As a survivor of rabbinic sexual abuse, I read this book to gain further insights into my situation and take me further along the road to recovery. Although my violation took place in a synagogue, and the book is set in a church, I had no trouble identifying with the victim. This is a problem that occurs far too frequently in all different faiths, no religion is immune to clergy abuse. This book addresses the issue of misconduct, what can be done to help prevent this from happening, and what a congregation can do to help and support the victim, should abuse take place in their house of worship. The author also addresses the victims, letting them know that they are not alone and where to go to find assistance and safe counseling. This book was of immense help to me."
5,Riveting! The author speaks from experience.,"What About Her is the best book I have read on clergy sexual abuse. The author tells about her true story with clarity and insight. It is easy to read and comforting for anyone who has been through this trauma or who knows somebody else who has lived with it. So much attention is focused on the abuser and why it all happened, but this book finally addresses the victim and asks - what about her?? If anyone should ask how any woman could be ""duped"" in this way, hand them a copy of this book! It belongs in every church library as well."
3,Good Solid Read....but not 5 Stars....maybe 3.5,"It's a quick-read and very helpful for anyone in the acute stage of dealing with an affair....from the spouse or the infidel perspective. But, it's not a 5-star read. Too focused on societal causes rather than personal responsibility, and the potential 'impact on kids' is covered too superficially as a consideration after 'money' and before 'home and garden'. But it's still a solid book!"
1,Not helpful,This book was terrible...It made me so angry I actually threw it away.Basic premise seems to be that a cheating spouse is not to blame for theirbehavior. It provides all sorts of 'society made him do it' nonsense. I was looking for a book that would help me to heal and somehow rebuild my marriage with my husband after discovering his long term affair with my best friend. I suppose different people may find it helpful but I found it to be completely worthless in that regard.
3,Book review,"Some useful information for recovering from an affair. I don't completely buy her theory, but there are several helpful chapters."
5,Great CD by Don featuring Lou Gramm & Phil Naro!,"Very strong release by Rochester,NY. guitarist Don Mancuso. Most tracks written by Don & buddy Phil Naro (Talas,24K,solo),with Naro singing lead on majority of the tunes. Also features long-time associate & former bandmate(Black Sheep) Lou Gramm on several tracks. Gramm shines as well-great to hear him singing again! Overall, a disc chock full of very melodic,hard-edged rockers with Don's signature guitarwork in the forefront-very tasteful soloing as well.There's even a funky jazzed-up track with horns and a cover of one of my fav. Beatle songs-'Hey Bulldog' to round out the affair. Highly recommended!!"
2,Great little projector - easy to use!,"****I bought this projector to use with a new laptop that has Windows Vista as the operating system and thought at first that it didn't have any drivers compatible with Vista. Well, I found out that I don't need drivers, regardless of what the installation software says ""driver for this monitor not found"". Ignore that and go on with the installation. It'll work! I tried to change the star rating I'd given it at first, but Amazon wouldn't let me!"
4,Lil Kitty will win your little one's hearts.,"Lil Kitty came into our lives when we lost our beloved pet of 17 years. Lil Kitty will never replace the compassion and softness of a real cat, but she will provide some fun and sweet memories of what its like to have a young cat in the house. The meow's don't sound that realistic but you can easily forgive that in the cuteness in its appearance."
2,no meow,"To be fair, I did buy for my cat and not a child so I can't say how a small human would react, but I were to guess I would say, confused. It kind of makes this high-pitched robotic ""yip yip"" sound. It's a slow mover, which is fine but I was kind of hoping for a more low-key ""meow"" sound."
2,okay considering kids get bored easy!,i purchased this toy for my 2 1/2 yr old girl and she loved it. fortunately she gets bored easy because this cat broke about 2 wks after we had it. not to say it isn't durable just not for a 2 1/2 yr old. i would purchase this again because ultimately my kid loved it.
4,Pretty good,This cat is really cute my 3 yr old had been begging for another kitten and puppy. The only thing is it don't actually meow it sort of squeeks and sounds like the dog one.
2,doesnt meow!,"i got this cat for the little girl i watch she LOVES cats but her parents dont want to get a real one. was very excited to see this walks and meows. Unfortuantly all it does is walk around going ""squeak squeak squeak"" a cat doesnt say squeak a cat says meow. was very upset!!!"
2,used for a week,"I got this for my son who loves kittys. Well, it is way SMALLER than expected and it doesn't do the ""pounce"" it's supposed to. It didn't really do anything. I'm sure there are way more entertaing things you can buy for $8 than this."
3,L'il Kitty Barks,"I bought this because the product info said that it ""meows"". It doesn't meow, it barks. The packaging is cute, the kitty is cute. It requires 2 double A batteries (not included) and when you turn it on it kind of scoots across the floor. We will still play with it, but if you are looking for a kitty that actually says ""meow""....this isn't it."
2,"Cute, but NOT durable","We got two of these for our 2 year old girls for Christmas. They absolutely love them, but one broke after 3 days. The other continues to work for now."
4,Cute,Bought these for my little granddaughters for Christmas. Didn't realize batteries were not included so opening them at Christmas was a disappointment. The battery compartment can only be opened with a Phillips head screwdriver with a very tiny head.
3,My receiptant loves it barking and all.,"It was nice however instead of the cat saying meow, it barks like a dog. I think the wrong sound box was put in because it does not in no way sound like a cat. Otherwise it walks, pounce and tail wiggles."
4,simple and useful,"I'm 5'8"" and 160lbs. and i originally ordered a small but it was just too tight in the midsection. The medium is a much better fit even if the arm length is slightly long. Overall, it's nice soft and warm. It isnt very windproof though unless your wearing at least a long-sleeve shirt under. It looks classy and sporty at the same time but thats just patagonia"
5,Lower price version of Shobogenzo Book 4,"You can find a lower price version of this book on Amazon. The lower price is $23.99.Click here:Master Dogen's Shobogenzoto go to the lower price version.If that link doesn't work, type ""1419638211"" (the book's URL) in the search field at the top of this page. The lower price version will appear in the search result."
5,Works Great,This works great. I have it plugged into my receiver/cd player. And a 10 discs cd changer and Hd radio plugged into the switching unit.It automatically switches between them when you select them on the receiver.If you have a older receiver you can use the supplied remote to switch between them.
1,Falls apart when touched,"I bought this item thinking I might give it as a gift for my aunt. It's a fun color and very good looking. It reminds me of a Japanese brand that I admire calle Beehouse.This product is NOTHING like that. When I pulled it out of the box it seemed good - nicely polished metal and smooth ceramic. However, as soon as I touched the metal lid, it fell off. The metal lid was unfinished and had black marks on the underside. It looked dirty. The hinge that was supposed to be fused to the metal cover looked like it had never been attached. As I fumbled with the hinge piece to see if it could be reattached it broke in two!I'm returning this ASAP!!!"
4,Tea for me!,"The top is a little wonky, but for $15 this is a good little tea pot. It pours very badly, but the color is great!"
4,Cute!,These are very cute but not packed well... I ordered several and they broke in shipping. Neat item!
2,Cute but cheap,"I bought this gift for my fiance who lives on the other side of the country. He was pleased when he received it, and got one or two uses out of it before the lid up and broke. He still plans to use it, but I'm very disappointed with the quality of the product considering the price I paid for it."
4,One of the Best,"There are many great books about drawing in print. This book has some of the greatest elements of them all. It includes no-nonsense instruction for drawing exercises that really help people learn to draw well. It includes a lot of examples of student work and work by masters. It has a special focus on the work of contemporary artists, and I think this is one of the things I find most compelling about the book. The appendices are very helpful, especially the one about keeping a sketchbook. A wide range of approaches and media are discussed.I used this lovely book as a text for a college-level beginning drawing course when it first came out about 20 years ago. I used it through the second edition of the text, and then switched to another book. After using two different texts and then no text for a while, I am returning to the Betti/Sale text. ..."
2,Bummed,"I'm pretty bummed with my order... for $70.00 I was at least expecting a book that wasn't falling apart. It is coming out of its binding, has writing on several pages, and is just falling apart altogether. I'm glad it was cheaper than what I would have paid at our university's bookstore, but I expected a little better."
2,Don't like anymore,"Must again write a min. of 20 words or more. The wires were really long, tips consume the entire plug and it was to hard to tell if it connected securely to the spark plug. Maybe its me but I think I like my other wires better"
5,Excellent Max factor product,Excellent Max factor No color mascara product. I not only use it on the eye lashes; but to tame the stubborn hair of my side burns
1,poor quality sheets,This set of sheets is poorly made and does not fit properly. The corners of the fitted sheet are so small they do not even come close to wrapping around the mattress. I'll not buy this brand again!
3,Seat is made for sitting not walking.,"I bought this because the price was right and the colors were good. But I couldn't tell from the pictures that the seat has the leg holes like a chair... The Holes are supposed to be straight down, not to the front with a flat piece for the child to sit... That makes it very difficult to stand in. My son is a big 6 month old and he gets quite aggitated when he tries to go forward and the seat gets in his way. He is very good at pushing backwards though. If we have him standing out of it and just hold his hands, he can walk just fine. Hope they change the pattern of the seat."
3,baby entertainment,"My baby loves sitting in the walker at 4months. She couldn't walk in it yet. She loved the music, it gets a bit tiring for me. The toys attached also entertains her. I now remove that toy tray and leave it out now that she is older. I give it 3 stars since I found better walkers. But for the price its a great walker."
2,"cute, but...","First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back."
2,Battery Problems!,"A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down."
2,seats too high,"I am returning this walker. It is pretty and feels solid, but IT DOES sit too high...I am talking 2 inches too high, and my daughter is 6 months and at the 75 percentile for height! No way she would be able to touch the ground until one year old...definetely too late!"
3,WILL BE good,"This is a nice walker and will be good if grandson gets to use it before he can walk. It's just too high. He's 6.5 months, 88 percentile in height and his feet still do not touch the ground. He's ready for a walker, but this one is just not usable yet. He may be walking before he's tall enough for this walker."
3,very affordable,"The colors are hurting my eyes (neon green, neon orange, purple and blue) -- colors are much brighter in actual than in photo. But oh well, it does its job. It rolls on carpet, has music and toys that make my baby busy. So ya, its aryt :) I recommend this product."
2,product is cheap as the price,"it definitely chaper than any other walker, but product itself is cheap too...if you are looking for just simple what your baby will ride on for short time, it is alright to try this but if you are looking for something nicer this isn:""t it at all.. it is cheap with not working lights from the begining.."
4,What more do you want?,"We got this product for our 10 months old daughter after looking around. It was the only affordable option available considering how long she is going to need that. We have no regrets at all... at first, she used it to play around with the lights and music and used it to just stand up and eat. In a day or so she figured out how to use it to walk around and all the toys took a back seat. We used the tray in front to feed her all the time. Basically after a kid starts maneuvering it they want to go after the stuff around the house and toys not-so-much! I have no complaint whatsoever... i didn't give it five stars because maybe there are products better than this but really no reason to do so."
2,Junk!,"This thing is a piece of junk! Thank God we got it at a baby shower, or I would have serious buyers-remorse.The wheels do NOT roll easily over uneven surfaces.The play toys on the upper part are rudimentary.Most importantly, the batteries crapped-out after one month of use! By the way, my son doesn't play in it much, and here we go, the battery is soldered in place. So, you need to buy the companies piece of crap!Look elsewhere for a quality toy."
2,Too bad you can't change the battery,"My son love the seat and helps to have him sit upright, but the battery is dying and now sounds like a sick cat."
2,For very tall babies,This product says it is for 4month olds. I bought it for my son at 5months. The problem is it is for very tall babies. My son now 6 months and is 26 1/2 inches long. He now can reach the floor with his tippy toes in the walker. All safety first walkers are like this as I was given as a gift another style and have the same problem. I now have a GRACO walker and he touches the floor just fine and has been named Speedy G with it. He loves the Graco one. This product is sturdy enough and I love the look but I just wish my son can touch the ground with it.
2,Poor Design on Sounds N' Lights Feature,"I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks. The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature. It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it. After much frustration trying to get ""to"" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all. The internal battery is soldered in place. Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby."
3,Lowest height is too tall,Walker is too tall for my 6-month old baby who is willing to start to walk. The lowest setting for this walker is too tall yet.My baby is already 26 inches tall.
4,"Practical, Economical, and Colorful","My wife and I bought this for our 9 month old daughter who has outgrown her swing, and was looking to be more active. She is about at that time to start walking, so we wanted to get something that would help her learn those skills independently. She loves the walker. It has a few toys on the removable tray which are okay, but they only keep her attention for about 30 minutes. It doesn't have as many ""bells and whistles"" as some of the more expensive models, but for the money it is a great deal."
4,You can buy more batteries!,"This walker is fine...nothing special. It works. The battery issue is annoying, but they can be changed and you can buy them cheap! The worlds largest auction site has packs of 20 available for only $5 or so. The extras can be used to replace batteries in books that make sounds when you press buttons. Lots of kids toys use these batteries. Just search on that auction website for Maxell LR44. That battery is compatible."
3,Works great simple and sturdy,I don't know if someone already put this out or not but the battery is not the first thing you see when after removing the three screws on the steering wheel. Remove the two screws from the printed circuit board and flip the board over. You will see 4 watch batteries that are very removable by simply bending up the unsoldered tab on each of the battery covers.Remember where everything came from. The two LEDs go into slots on the bottom part of the wheel. Notice the lip on the LED that's what goes into the slot.Not the best walker I've ever seen but for the price it does serve the purpose well.
4,WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES!,I love the fact that this walker folds down for storage. And you can't beat the price but to change the batteries on this thing is a pain to say the least! My husband used a 1/4 inch open end-boxed end wrench with a phillips head screwdriver bit to remove the screws on each side of the steering wheel. The one in the center is for the light which can be changed too. Once you are inside the steering wheel(Congrats by the way!) remove the two screws on the inside and turn this piece over to reveal the batteries. It takes four lithium batteries. I don't know the size as of it. I read reviews saying the battery was souldered into place. The only thing I can figure is she was trying to remove the speaker. I hope this helps!
3,How to change the batteries,"The batteries ran out after about two months, but after a little investigation I found that the batteries can be changed. First, remove the three screws on the bottom side of the wheel. Second, remove the two screws from the electronic panel. On the bottom side of the panel there are four ""watch-type batteries"". I used Energizer 357/303. A little steep at $2.75 a piece."
1,too big STILL,"My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor. He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!) I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work. The lowest setting is still slightly too high. Not impressed. Kinda boring. Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else."
1,Ridiculous...,"This walker is very poor quality. The ""entertainment"" features are pitiful - the most exciting part being a wheel that partially turns. The saddest part of this walker is that the battery cannot be changed (at least as far as the 4 adults, one being an engineer, in my house can figure). My husband even drilled holes in the thing trying to figure out how to change the battery - only to find the battery that it comes with is irreplaceable. It is frustrating because the music just warbles out now on it's dying battery. Very sad being I've only had this walker for 2 months. In sum - DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!"
2,It's Just OK.,I bought this walker for my 7 month old daughter. The lowest setting is still not low enough for her to reach the floor and she's not a short little girl. It's a little cheap looking but I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Activity walker,"The walker is great if you have wood floors or some other kind of smooth surface, but the small wheels make it hard for the baby to move it on carpet or in the grass. Also, the batteries in the lights and sounds part of the ""activity"" walker can not be replaced, so once it dies, that's it."
1,Lowest height is too tall - AGREED,"My son's feet do not touch either and he's around 27 inches tall. So I guess its hit or miss. I don't want to wait for him to grow into it, because it's something he should be using now. Off to find another that he can touch the ground."
3,baby's walker,"This Walker was just right for my son, although one of the play buttons didn't work, he still enjoys it."
2,My daugher likes it ...,"We purchased this walker a few months before my daughter was born thinking that it was a good price so why pass it up. Well, when it finally came time to open up the box, the music didn't work. In the instructions it says that there is no way to replace the batteries ... well, if you happen to be married to a very determined ""handy man"", it can be done. It's some type of watch battery that costs about $15. When the music does play it is extremely loud so we don't even use it after going through all of that trouble. We don't want to hurt our little one's ears. She does like banging on the steering wheel and playing with the little gadgets on the sides though. She isn't quite big enough to make it go all by herself so she just sits and plays in it while I'm cooking in the kitchen with a little stool underneath her feet. I also purchased a stand alone jumper and feel that it was a little more appropriate and money better spent. Just my opinion though. :)"
1,dangerous collapsed,"I have four kids under the age of five. I just got this walk to replace an old one that didn,t fold. I returned this today. my 2yr old pressed the red button to fold it and it collapsed with my 8 month old inside. she didn't get hurt."
1,not that good,i ended up buying a different one... it's cheap and it was shipped fast... but it's not all that great
1,cheap and unsafe,"Firstly, this is so cheaply made. It's a total tip hazard as well, due to the height. Secondly, walkers are a HUGE head injury risk and shouldn't be used period.This was a gift. I hope the person who gave it to us never has kids."
4,walker,"this walker is very sturdy and easy to assemble, the only problem I encountered with it is that there are only three height levels, the other one I have can go to a lower position than this one, other than that it is a great item."
3,a little boring,"My son was not very impressed with the toys.... it doesnt make much sound, for it to be called a ""lights and sounds"" walker. As far as functional, it was great. For the price it was fine, but nothing to rave over."
4,Good for the money,This walker was a good buy. The toy bar and music feature are not what entertains my daughter so don't buy it for the toys. But she loves to use the walker to zip around the house. It works great for that.
3,Doesn't freely moves on carpet,"I bought this walker based on the reviews it has which are pretty good. But, when I got it hope I was disappointed. It's cute and sturdy and all, but it has these rubber bumpers on the bottom that prevent it from rolling on carpet. It moves freely on wooden or linoleum floors, but not at all on carpet. I have yet to remove the bumpers to see if it will work better."
1,Wrong item,they sent me the wrong item and I've been chasing them for 3 months and they wont give me my money back or even contact me to deal with what they've done
1,2011 Version Already Out of Date,"I took the ""fully updated"" 2011 version of the guide on a trip to Hong Kong in December 2011 and found numerous errors or places the guide is already out of date. For instance:1) The book twice states that the city trams cost HK $2 and that exact change is required (pages 123 and 259). The fare is actually HK $2.302)The guide indicates that the Hong Kong Discovery Centre is not open on Saturdays (page 157), but it is open then.3)The guide states, ""From Fanling station, it's a short ride on the 64K minibus to the Leung Yuk Tau Heritage Trail (page 190). You actually need to take the 54K minibus.4)The guide states that there are Star Ferry routes from Hung Hom to both Central and Wan Chai (page 258). That service was canceled as of April 1, 2011.The book is attractive and has a lot of information--unfortunately,too much of the information is unreliable. Needless to say, this is not a guidebook you would want to rely upon to navigate or tour Hong Kong."
1,check your product throughly,the battery was missing for the camera and the camera and the recharger was there what at will thesereve??
4,"Great peice of literature, very well written poetry","An awesome book that tells about Dante's trip through Hell, with a very famous guide named Virgil. Not exactly docternal, but good imagination. He incorperates many of the people he knew, or who were famous then into the story. It makes you want to learn Latin so you can read it without translation."
2,Chillin' The Bow Tie,"Although well written and researched, this book was a let down for me. I expected a slew of clear pictures with maybe some color shots, but had to settle for poorly developed black and white shots that left me wanting.The second factor was the repetition of facts. We all know every Chevy dealer sold Corvairs.....why shove it in our face every chapter?All in all, I think this book could well be skipped by Chevy fans."
4,Fun toy,My son loves this space shuttle. I wish the wheels were a little more durable. But otherwise the quality is great! We have several from this company and all look very nice and hold up well.
2,Judy parodies herself,Be aware that these tracks are not the popular versions you've heard before. These are heavily orchestrated muzak-style versions on which Judy sings way over-the-top. The music reminds me very much of something you would see on a modern PBS special featuring washed-up musicians in some sort of lavish production. Although her voice is still quite pretty on this album I'm just not fond of the arrangements. They're not at all the folksy renditions for which Judy Collins is known. If one were to have insomnia then this may make a good lullaby album.
1,Partial order,"The item I received did NOT include the mixing valve: Just the shower head, handle and some teflon installation tape!"
4,"Got it for a Friend, Maybe it Helped","I bought this book for a friend of mine who to say the least I believe is severely lacking in the emotional intelligence department. If there is such a thing. Actually, it was Vesta's idea (my wife). She said it would be good for her. She is a middle aged woman who behaves as if she were twelve.Whether it helped her or not, is debatable. But I like to think it did. At least she's showing a bit more initiative now. Not much, but a little and that's something."
4,One of my favorite hot sauces for that extra kick,I have been a fan of Louisiana Gold Hot Sauce for over 10 years now. It has a very delicate flavor with a nice mild heat that really adds a a great flavor to foods without that vinegary bite.
5,A best kept secret,"This is a much or sophisticated sauce than tabasco. Its spicy, but doesn't overpower the taste of the food itself, or cauterize your taste buds, any many hot sauces do. Last night my wife put on smoked salmon... it really worked well.I first tasted it on eggs at my local Denny's restaurant. I tried to buy it at every store I could think of in Illinois and Wisconsin-- no luck. I'm sooo glad Amazon carries it!"
3,LOVE the sauce....HATE that you won't ship it to me!,"Hubby and I love Louisiana Gold Hot Sauce! Only problem is they don't sell it in Hawaii.Went on their official website and the hot sauce itself is under $3/bottle...but to shipit to Hawaii they want to charge over $30 in shipping?! That's ridiculous!I was excited to find it on Amazon and didn't even mind that we'd have to purchase 12bottles at once. However, when it came time to check out, it states they won't ship toHawaii. What the?!!Time to find another hot sauce!I would've rated this 5 stars, that's how good the sauce is. It loses 2 stars simply for thefact that it's too hard to get it."
5,A classic in children's video,"I think the main reason why this video is getting such mixed reviews is because it's an older video. The production values, admittedly, are not as slick as Wiggle Time & Yummy Yummy; however, Wake Up Jeff is 2 years older than these two others. TV shows change their look as they mature, and the Wiggles are no different in that respect. At any rate my 18-month old daughter loves all 3 videos, and Wake Up Jeff has now placed the Wiggles way ahead of Barney, which I personally am thankful for :) She loves to dance and jump around as the Wiggles do, and I love to see her remember the actions to her favorite songs. Way to go to these upbeat, creative, and rather active guys from Down Under! I can't wait to see more!"
2,Disappointing,"After a much anticipated wait, my 16 month old and I found ""Wake Up Jeff"" disappointing. It lacks the musical energy of the first two videos and barely holds her attention. While the characters are all familiar, the songs and skits are not as ""catchy"". Also, at a mere 37 minutes, this video is over almost before it begins! :-("
3,Wake ME up!!,"Not very impressed,I have seen better.It doesn't hold my sons attention span nearly like Wiggly Safari does."
2,Baby Birds Mommie,"I have a one year old and she loves the Wiggles. They are one of the only video's that she will watch. We have quite a few and sadly, this one just doesn't seem to excite her. MAybe it is just Jeff, but the songs aren't as upbeat and the theme really does want you to join Jeff and fall asleep."
2,Disappointing,"This children's video has the least amount of singing and dance routines and suffers as a result. What is more the songs are less catchy and somewhat clumsy and dull. There is none of the energy or vitality of the previous video. ""Wiggles Time"" which my son adores and can not wait to see. Instead he soon lost interest in this one and wondered off ! This is a waste of money because we know that the Wiggles team can do better"
2,Water reservoir is a pending disaster,"The water reservoir is very awkward to handle. After filling the reservoir I must screw in the water delivery tube and then, without holding the rim (as per instructions), turn the heavy reservoir right-side up. There are just no good ways to grasp this thing during this procedure, and I am always concerned that it will slip from my hands.My guess is that Hunter will have good sales replacing these reservoirs that the owners have ""carelessly"" handled.Other than this defect, the humidifier seems to work very well for a small room. However, this defect alone affects almost all its advantages, and I would recommend against the purchase of this humidifier."
1,Don't waste your time!!,"I bought two of these units and I think they work acceptably. Again, I say acceptably, as in they add just enough humidity. I agree with the other reviews on this item, they are murder to keep clean. Once the calcuim build up starts, you are fighting a losing battle. Also, I just read on the EPA recommendations on humidifiers http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/humidif.html) and I quote ""Recent studies by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have shown that ultrasonic and impeller (or ""cool mist"") humidifiers can disperse materials, such as microorganisms and minerals, from their water tanks into indoor air."""
2,noisy,"I love not having my clothes pop and crackle every time I change, but this thing is noisy. The fan rattles. I bought the same kind at a local store and it rattled too so it is likely a defect in this model. Don't buy it if you enjoy quiet."
1,piece of junk,Stopped working within two years of purchase. When it was working it never produced enough humidity for a medium sized room. Was also a total nightmare to clean. I expected better from Hunter.
2,Care-free is a total misnomer,"I bought this unit just under a year ago, and finally abandoned it to go back to a Holmes. Its design is good in theory, and it did a decent job keeping the air in my 1200 sq ft home humidified, but it was so difficult to clean! It immediately started accumulate white (then yellow) mineral deposits that I tried cleaning with chemicals, stiff scrub brushes, even in my dishwasher, but nothing worked. Eventually, the fan started making a loud ticking sound, probably because it was off balance from all the gunk that built up on it. Also, I thought the unit was unnecessarily large. The bottom half of the gray base does not have a functional purpose. When I first got it, I did note the fan was fairly quiet, but I didn't think it was that much quieter than previous Holmes units I've owned. Overall, I think this unit is not worth the trouble."
1,Good idea gone bad!,"I purchased this humidifier knowing there were cleaning issues from other reviews. It ran for 7 days before slowing to a crawl. I did the vinegar soak and got about 7 more days. Then the fan blades started to knock on the calcium buildup on the housing. Working with a knife I was able to chip a lot of it off. This routine went on for six weeks. Working on it last week I told my wife to bring me a yard bag and it went out with the garbage. I feel like a new man, at my age I don't need that kind of aggravation!Yes, I bought another Hunter, 2.5 gallon, WITH A WICK!"
2,Works O.K. but not like product description.,"I bought Two of these units for my home which is approx 2100 sq. ft. The units say they will humidify 1250 sq. ft. The units only put out about 1 gallon of water in a 24 hr period and barely kept my house at 40% humidity. I kept the units for 3 weeks and decided to return them. When I took the units apart to return them, there was an enormous amount of calcium scale inside the unit and all over the fan. Glad I returned them! Looks like they would be a cleaning nightmare. I think having no wicks is a good concept but hunter needs to work on the design a little more. I think I'll stay with the wicks for now."
5,"Dissonant, meditative","This album is brilliant. If you enjoyed Loveless from My Bloody Valentine or Goo or Dirty from Sonic youth, you'll probably like La Mia Vita Violenta. It has a great balance of slow dreamy numbers and ear drum popping rockers. I saw Blonde Redhead a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco and they blew me away. The songs that they performed form this album were particularly good. For three skinny little people, they sure know how to make a lot of noise."
3,Another slightly greater introduction,"Ultimately a better produced expansion to their debut, I would have liked to have seen these first two albums compiled onto one release to make a stronger debut since they both apparently were released in the same year. Vocals are beginning to come into their own, piercing yet inviting screams and all for the female, but her counterpart's delivery feels bland in comparison. The jagged beauty of most songs are pointing at better things to come, they were simply intent at remaining more ""indie"" then their songwriting would end up suggesting at this point."
3,A Sound Purchase,"Some albums seduce with their sound (produced by a combination of playing, mixing, and mastering). This is one of those. On some tracks, guitar lines that add harmonic interest are barely audible, but can somehow be ""heard"" as a dominant element. ""UFO"" ends with a descending vamp reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix Experience's ""Third Stone from the Sun"", and contains all the outa-space droning quality of that tune. ""Harmony"" successfully unites sitar with down-tempo rock. On ""Bean"", the male and female vocals, both naive and imperfect, are embedded in the music just enough to draw in the listener. I'm not going to try to comment on the lyrics."
3,TeLL me More Arabic Complete Package (4 Levels from Beginner to Advanced,Hi! This software is a oldversion. make sure you buy a newer version of TeLL me More Arabic Complete Package (4 Levels from Beginner to Advanced).
5,a breakthrough ballads albumn,"If your a Harry Allen fan you,ll love this cd,if not this will make you a fan of this up and coming tenor player with the Ben Webster,Stan Getz sound.Also a top flight back up group headed by Joe Cohn and the piano great, John Bunch.You can tell by the song list it,s all Ballads."
1,sound quality was poor,"I am not a fan of hot jazz, so maybe my review is biased. I wa hoping for very smooth jazz which this is not. Also the sound quality was poor. I returned it."
2,out of order,"I might by this book if i could get the first book, selling the second only is kind of silly and is just bad marketing."
4,Rissa and Tregare,"Book two: Together Rissa and Tregare, will build an armada to free Earth, but first they must conquer the Hidden Worlds. I found it a little slow to begin with. I did't find it as good as the first book in the series. But it is better then alot of other books I've read."
1,Not True,"I am good friends with CT from real world Pairs, and after reading this book and I can tell you most of it is not true. It is all exagerated, and lies."
1,Made my CKC Spaniel Sick,"After using the bacon flavor for training my CKC Spaniel (who did, LOVE THEM...they must be VERY tasty), he had very soft stools and complete runs all night, every hour. After 5 days on the same diet, we took him to the vet, and pulled the treats. He's much better now. This product has sugar as the #4 ingredient. Look elsewhere for a good treat."
1,Very old!,"I ordered that treat for my dog, she loves halthy treats.Probably she would love this one but when I received it found out it's almost six months after due date.So be careful ordering treats for your little ones."
3,"it depends on the dog, or maybe the flavor.","I've used these training rewards with two dogs now. One a parson russell and the other a border collie.The russell would climb mount everest for one of the beef flavor.The border won't even lift his head for one of the bacon ones. ( although bits of meat from a boneless rib sandwich make him salivate like a saint bernard, makes it hard to enjoy my dinner)"
3,not tasty,"I love the size of these, great for training puppies. My puppy, however, hates the taste. He spits them out. I guess in comparison with Milk Bones and his liver treats, these didn't taste very good. We had much better luck with the beef flavored variety of the same brand."
3,Wrong size good product.,The actual product shipped is less ounces than the description gave. The product however is an excellent training tool for pets
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I just purchased Calendar Creator 8.0 and it will not print with Windows XP. I spent over 4 hours with tech support at Lexmark, over 2 hours folowing Borderbund's tech support advice to download new printer drivers and finally made a call to Borderbund (not a free call - waited 23 minutes paying long distance). After about 5 minutes, the tech support person told me that they were having problems with Calendar Creator running in XP and there was no solution at this time.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this software locally, and tried to install it yesterday. Instructions say to shut down any background programs when installing in Windows ME, which I did. Not only did the software not install--although there were noises and blinking lights--the process somehow made my CD and DVD drives ""undetectable"" by my computer, just as if they didn't exist. Upon going to the support URL listed on the package, I found out the product is no longer supported, so if there's a problem you're on your own. I got my drives back through system restore and Windows Update.So, be careful with this one, especially if you have any of the newer Windows OS's; it was evidently made for the older ones and has compatibility problems. I was surprised and disappointed, because I've had good luck with Broderbund before."
1,"A terrible, horrible, no good, very bad piece of software.","I bought this product to make family calendars and have found it useless. My biggest beef? You can't have more than one event on a date -- it appears on as ""overflow"" that you must print as an additional sheet! How many families do you know with no overlapping birthdays or anniversaries?"
1,can 't set the dates!,"I really hate this product. It defaults to the start date of whenever *today* is, and I'm trying to work on a project for 2004. It's awful and I'm not sure whether to upgrade and discover they've improved it, or to look elsewhere. This program is really not worth purchasing, IMO."
5,Great advice!,"This book was awesome. It has practical, great advice, written in a conversational style that makes it easy to read. These are the things no one ever teaches you but you REALLY need to know - and it comes from the voice of someone OUR age who has been there, not some condescending ""adult."" (Wait - are we adults?) But seriously, I am buying this book for every new college grad. I highly recommend it."
3,An OK sling,"A heavy sling. Not as secure in the field as described.Contains lead, not a good thing.There are better slings available."
1,Piece of crap,"This sling is a piece of crap. The swivels do not stay shut, also they do notattach evenly to the rifle connection.."
4,Doesn't include everything,"This strap in and of itself seems pretty good, please keep in mind thought you might need extra accessories. For example on a Remington 870' you need a mourning point in the front, such as a pin for the front magazine cap or a whole new cap in general that allows for the attachment of the front swivel."
5,"""wake up ... breathe ... keep breathing""","The last Golden Palominos album I heard was Drunk With Passion, which I really liked ... but this is something entirely different altogether. The opening track, ""Victim"", is truly disturbing, and the rest of the album stays true to that motif. When I first heard it, I was very affected and actually thought that I wouldn't be able to listen to it again for awhile, but that evening I had to hear it again, as I did the next day. If you don't mind contemplating the dark underbelly of humanity as well as the lofty aspirations; if you reflect on the portent as well as the promise, then you may really enjoy this. I definitely do."
4,"""all that breaks is the flesh""","so, this cd is something that you're gonna love or hate. one of my friends said she found it pretentious; another said, 'damn you, I have to walk home alone tonight'. It's just that kind of cd. the music is thumping, sometimes etheral, sometimes like your heart after you slam on the brakes of your car.for my money, nicole blackman does outstanding work. from ""victim"" to ""metal eyes"" she whispers songs that stay with you long after the cd is off. and yeah, sometimes (a lot of the time) they're not too pretty. but they are beautiful, in their own way."
2,Eh..,"It's spoken word over electronic music. That's all.Sometimes the words tell a story in a remarkable way- Victim in particular feels perfect on every level. The background music is a lost world, layered underneath the tension of the victim's voice. But even the best track becomes dull with repeated listens.Dead Inside is not an exceptionally experimental or difficult album to listen to. It's not even a bad album, but I was disappointed after so many other encouraging reviews."
1,...,"Extremely disappointing. After ""Pure"" I thought GP/Anton would deliever something amazing. No wonder Lori Carson jumped off the Palomino. Dont bother!!!!"
2,Didn't inspire,"I expected to documentary to go into a bit more detail about their training regimes...not exactly extensively discussed here. Also, Peter Reid comes across as a big whiner. Yes, he had a tough year that year, but come on! He's an elite athlete, but so clearly has an eating disorder (he admits that himself). Not exactly someone I would like to aspire to be like...The other athletes in the documentary are exemplary and very inspiring. Again, just not the type of information I was expecting to get."
5,Excellent Insight!,"This book is a must read if you've been in any sort of manipulative relationship weather it be romantic, friendships, or family related. Not only are the hints helpful in recognizing WHEN you're being manipulated, but it provides the tools necessary to combat manipulative situations. Every aspect of this book applied in my life somewhere and in multiple areas such as work, home, love, family, and friends. A MUST read for everyone as we've all been prey to manipulators at one time or another.On an alternate note, there are also scenarios in this book that might make you think of a time or times that you have manipulated others. It's helpful to have these pointed out and be conscious of your own manipulative tactics even if you weren't aware of them previously."
5,The best of the genre,"This is the most practical book on the subject. You have tips on how to react, or in most cases how not to! Get this alongsideEmotional Vampires: Dealing With People Who Drain You DryandEmotional Blackmail: When the People in Your Life Use Fear, Obligation, and Guilt to Manipulate YouThen you'll be armed to the teeth!*Btw don''t bother with the book ""In sheep's clothing"", it goes nowhere."
4,One of the milkmen's strongest albums!,"I don't understand the bad publicity surrounding this album; it is funny, well-paced, and musical. In fact, I'd argue that this is their strongest release next to Metaphysical Grafitti & Not Richard But Dick, and their strongest in terms of sheer musicality. If you are a teeny-bopper that likes raw punk, then you won't like this album; if you are someone who can appreciate the evolution and maturation of a band over the years, then this album is for you. ""Peter Bazooka"" remains one of the cleverest Dead Milkmen tracks ever, and Khrissy, I can't stay awake, and Big Deal are amazing in their own right. Don't let the sour-pusses deter you from a great album; This is one I've listened to at least 50 times all the way through - there is a lot of good stuff here, for those able to realize that the Dead Milkmen are more than a angsty-punk band."
4,Master at work,Wonderful storytelling as usual. What else I can say? Though I do wonder about the Japanese culture and Murakami brings out the interesting and also supressed nature of his country.
2,Not Pinball,"Amazon markets this book under the title of the book Pinball. While I realized the book was random chapters from various works by Murakami, I didn't know that there isn't a word of Pinball in the book. Amazon has either made a mistake or a misrepresentation. This book, although interesting, has nothing to do with the book Amazon says it is."
5,This Vacuum Really Works,"This is the first Amazon.com review I've written.I've read many reviews by thoughtful folks and decided to it's pay back time. This Panasonic vacuum is perfect for those like myself who has an upright vacuum but need something that can handle crevices, is lightweight for car cleaning, pretty, powerful, has a retractable (but slightly shorter) cord, made by a solid company, and sells at a reasonable price.I've had this vacuum for two months and have used it weekly. So far, every positive review on this model has been accurate. I did take people's advice and ordered extra vac bags from Amazon.com just to be safe.Virtually all my electronics equipment in my home, including the tv, dvd player, vhs player, home theater equipment, and cameras are by Panasonic. Now I know why."
2,no bags!,Don't buy this vacuum cleaner! It's impossible to find replacement bags for it -- I've tried everywhere. Even the online Panasonic store doesn't sell them. Plus it doesn't come with a dust-brush attachment.
1,not worth it,this died after ten minutes from overheating. total waste of time and effort. not to mention money.
1,Vacuum - problem,"This is the worst vaccum I ever owned, nolt only you can not find bags to replace. It will work on hard wood floor if you are lucky but forget any carpet not powerful at all. Big disapointment"
4,Panasonic MC-V3900,This vacuum is a powerhouse machine. It turned out to be everything the other reviews stated and those reviews were the main reason I purchased it.
4,Good purchase experience,I placed an order and received the pakcage few days later. It works well with a reasonable price.
4,Perfect except for one problem...,"I love *almost* everything about this vaccuum. It's easy to maneuver and it's very powerful. I have a studio apartment with hardwood floors and area rugs and it cleans everything perfectly with no problems at all. It's tiny, so I can store it right next to my mops and brooms.The one complaint I have is the pipe extender (like a person who reviewed below). The pieces will NOT stay together while vacuuming. I'm an earnest cleaner, but not so much that I pull things apart! It literally just falls apart because is has no snaps to hold them in place. I used duct tape on the top two joints, but I still have to deal with the bottom bit coming off periodicaly, because I want to still be able to switch attachments easily. If that part were fixed, this little guy would be perfect. But I definitely don't like the idea of having to rig something up to work right when it's brand spanking new."
2,Super-frustrating to use,"This vacuum is light and has good suction, true. And I didn't have any difficulty finding the bags. The problem is that the wands and brush are not threaded and have no locking mechanism, so they are CONSTANTLY detaching. In vacuuming any given room, I typically have to stop, pick up the pieces, and jam them back together 4-5 times. It's absolutely infuriating. I've considered duct-taping them together, but then, of course, I'd lose the flexibility of using them separately.Very disappointing purchase--I should have sent it back right away."
3,"Little simple one, but no bags around.","This vacuum is small and light, so unlike those heavy, unflexible upright cleaners, it's really easy to take this out from my bloom closet for quick cleaning.It doesn't have any fancy features --- no brush/upholstery attachment, no multi-power switches -- there's only one switch to use; on/off. But it vacuums powerfully, so does enough job for my hardwood floors (for whom with carpeted floors, this maybe is not a right choice).The biggest downside is, it is not easy to find replacement bags. I searched and searched, and finally found them in a Japanese store. I definetely think that Amazon.com should carry that replacement bags if they continue to sell this item."
3,Almost there,"I like the weight and mobility and suction and cord length, but the darn extension wands don't stick together well - they keep falling off as I vacuum. I really don't want to have to tape them together, because that defeats the versatility, but I don't think I have any choice."
4,Panasonic MC-V3900 Canister Vacuum,"I bought this as a second vacuum for my rec room. It's surprisingly powerful and does well both on the bare slate floor and the medium pile rug. I love that it has a retractable cord which is a good length.The only problems I have are with the hose and attachments. The hose is too short and very shabby. All of the attachments (from the hose to the floor attachment to the angled nozzle and the brush) don't really fit well together and often come apart in the midst of cleaning. Also, because it is a small vacuum, the bags are small and although I've only used it about 4 times, I've already had to change the bag (I do have two pets).In spite of the problems, for the price and the small space in which I'll be using it, the good definitely outweighs the bad."
3,HUH?,"While I'm sure students of film and film theory will find this book a valuable resource, a novice to the genre should probably seek out another book. Mr. Perkins does not elucidate the topic of film theory, but instead takes a heavy handed approach to the subject and leaves those unfamiliar with the subject scratching her head."
3,Interesting cross section of this City's interiors,"Ms. Wedekind portrays an interesting cross section of this city's interiors through selected homes and apartments. Unfortunately; she has done little research other than browsing through already published glossy spreads in periodicals. I did not find one interior that had not already been published and was disappointed by this volume after having seen her last on Paris. Hopefully, she will do a little research if she continues this series."
3,"Good knife, mediocre handle","This is a great knife -- top-rated by Cooks' Illustrated magazine. But the rosewood handle is narrow and uncomfortable. (I'm a guy, but by no means have huge hands.) The fibrox version of the same knife (Forschner 40547) has a much more comfortable handle."
2,Thought I was buying a new book,"The book I bought was not ""new"" as labeled. It was in fair condition and had decent highlights and notes. However, if I wanted to buy a used book I would have went in that category"
1,Great book if you need to fall asleep,"The book is horribly boring and I was thrilled to hear that my instructor sent the wrong ISBN so I didn't have to read it. For those of you who have to, my condolences."
5,Grant Hart's Sugar,"So i never write reviews for Amazon, but i'm astounded by the lack of interest in this record. Nova Mob was Grant Hart's equivalent to former bandmate Bob Mould's Sugar, and while the latter may have been superior, that does not discount the excellence of this album.Fans of Husker Du's later records, especially ""Warehouse,"" should find this album quite satisfying. Much like Hart's tracks on that album (""Too Much Spice"" being my personal favorite) these songs are wonderful chunks of pop. ""Old Empire"" and ""Little Miss Information"" are so unbelievably infectious i don't know how they weren't bigger singles.Just buy it. Don't think about it."
2,Nothing special,"Being a big Husker Du fan, I really wanted to like this album. But it wasn't long before it became a forgotten member of my music collection.""Old Empire"" is a crackling leadoff tune. It shows off the drumming of new recruit Steve Sutherland, a vast improvement over incompetent original drummer Michael Crego. It's the best thing on the album.The rest of the album has its moments. ""Little Miss Information"" is catchy, although I can't listen to it without thinking about Adam Sandler's old Cajun Man character. I like ""See And Feel And Know."" And the two bonus songs didn't deserve to be buried anonymously at the end; they're better than quite a few of the listed songs.In the end, though, this album did nothing to change my opinion that Bob Mould was the real ace in Husker Du and Hart was the secondary talent."
3,"I had high hopes after reading the first review, which were enhanced","by the exquisite clarinet and strings, recorded close up, which introduce ""Embraceable You."" Vic's voice when he enters, however, seems to be coming from a portable phonograph in the middle distance. I'm aware that these selections were recorded late in his life--at a stage where Will Friedwald suggests his voice had deepened from violin to cello--but I believe his engineers could have served him better."
2,sound quality issues,"I am a Vic Damon fan but I thought this CD seemed to have serious sound engineering problems. In addition to previous reviewer's comment on the sound quality, my CD had a definite low end rumbling sound - like a car in idle with a disconnected muffler - very annoying.Would recommend avoiding this recording, based on the CD I received through Amazon."
5,"Sleek, Chic, and Gets the Job Done","I got my cart in red. When I received it, the zipper was defective/broken, so they sent me new one. I use my cart to hold a good amount of food, and usually transport it by train. Its lightweight, so it just takes on the weight of she contents you put in it. Its durable, though I had a wheel pop off on one occasion. Overall, Im very pleased with it."
5,very nice,Nice litle kart easy to use inside and out the grocery store. Good quality stand up by it self and easy ride around the corner.
1,"Great cooler, so-so value","I love the vibrant color of this cooler and I found the wheels both convenient and round. However, at $1127, I almost feel like I could have got a better deal if I had shopped around a bit more. Still, I feel happy and confident knowing that this fine product is offered at such a fair and honest price. $1127 is not ridiculous at all."
3,Wrong Color!!!!,"I ordered this for a fundraising auction. It is not the pretty baby blue as shown, but rather a darker, almost navy. If it had been for me I would have returned it, but it still coordinated with the other items it is being packaged with. Disappointed."
4,A great and must read book!,"A really good book! Keep up the good work, Ms. Martin!The season is spring, and wedding bells ring! At least, that's the thing that's on Stacey's mind. When a student teacher arrives at Stoneybrook Middle School and is going to be Stacey's subsitute math teacher, Stacey can't pay attention in class! Wes is cute, but he's 22! But then Stacey realizes that not every romance will work. Read this book!"
3,Excellent printer with some drawback,"Perfect pictures, natural colors, very easy handling, including the software. All straight forward. Printing is real fun. The printer is very small and no noise at all. Runs on 100-240V/50-60Hz what makes it a good travel printer if you want to have your pictures while you are away from home.The only drawback is, that the print cartridges (printer ribbons) are regionalized what means that you cannot buy the printer in the US and then get your supplies in another part of the world (including Caribbean/Southamerica, Europe, etc.)."
4,very good.,the printer is very light and compact. Easy to install. Fast printing when using printing from console. Since windows is very slow printing.The paper used is too delicate.It is generally very good.
4,Good Product,I bought the shorts for my wife as a gift to play volleyball in and she likes to run in them also. They seem to be well made.
1,Disappointing,"Upon first removing it from the box I noticed that the set felt very fragile and it was. The cup broke (from a very slight bump) the first time I washed it, making the set useless. The top part, the teapot, is not very attractive on it's own and it dribbles when you pour it, so you can't really use it anywhere you don't want to mop up spilled tea. For me, this is a very disappointing waste of money."
2,I'm also disappointed.,"I agree with the person who says that this teapot is very fragile. The first one I ordered came to me with the lid already broken, but Amazon was awesome and exchanged it no problem.The second one lasted about a week before it broke. I was simply washing it in the sink and it slipped out of my hands. I'm going to try the Chantal one and see if it's any better."
5,One of The Best,"This was one of the best books ever.It is written by Jesse Stuart,a Kentucky native and it focuses around a Kentucky family in the 1800s. Its a great love story and just a all round great book, even for guys. I truly enjoyed this book and would gladly reccomend it to anyone. Its really fantastic!"
2,Not the best,"I bought this vacuum having had good luck with Panasonic products in the past. The vacuum is fairly quiet and follows well as you move around the house. However the hose and cord are both too short making cleaning more difficult than it should be. Also, this vacuum does not pick up as well as the Eureka it is replacing. Not sure if this is a problem with the suction or floor tool. Last, my wife broke some of the plastic parts when replacing the bag today. This may have been her fault but I would like to think that she could not break the vacuum just by changing the bag no matter how hard she tried."
2,Not a good buy,"The vacuum works ok...good suction, and rolls around well. The wand tubes don't stay attached to the hose, no matter how hard you force them in. The attachments are a joke, except for the floor attachment, which is plastic and is easy on floors and furniture. The hose is too short to reach an 8 foot ceiling unless you stand the vacuum on end. The cord retracts well, but could be a few feet longer. Forget about finding bags. Apparenty you throw the vacuum away after you use the two bags it comes with."
3,good,"even though i wouldnt say a lot of their songs are ""traditional"", their music is still better that a lot of whats out there today, especially if you dont like contemporary christian music"
5,From Country Church To Rock,"The title song of the this album is a perfect map of the transformation of the roots of traditional gospel into rock'n'roll and beyond.In the opening moments, Sam Cooke moves from delicious Soul Stirrer classic stylings to the underpinnings of the Elvis Presley music transformation of the 50's which sustain the center of the performance.Than, in the final minute of the song, he anticipates the relentless intensity of 70's reggae-rock fusion moments such as Toots and the Maytals in songs like ""Pressure Drop"" and finally concludes with a flat-out full-energy performance comparable to any of the great 80's and 90's rock vocals you'd care to name.One of the top 100 classic vocals in all of 20th century popular music."
5,Does exactly what it is designed to do.,"I bought the mechanical 15 minute timer because I wanted to control a 12-volt application. Unlike many of the digital wall timers out now, this one does not require 120V to operate. Works perfectly. Not much else to say!"
4,Timer,"I use ths timer many times a day and it lasted three years. I guess that's not too bad, compared to most modern things. The new one works fine, but is a little noisier than the previos one. Fifteen minute timers are not common, so I am glad they still are available."
5,Very good for oily skin,"The Glyderm is gentle, but good for oily skin and combination skin. I've used this product and my daughter did during her teen years with great results."
3,Filter this one.,Krakauer wrote a stunning account of Everest in 1996 and Boukreev was there. Dewalt wasn't there. Boukreev is no longer with us. This book contains some of Boukreev's accounts of his experiences on Everest in 1996 and therein lies its value. Skip Dewalts editorializing but be sure to read an updated version of Jon Krakauer's book as he sets the record straight as to the situation with Boukreev and himself.
2,Boring,"If Anatoli Boukreev could've gotten past trying to pose as a saint this might have been a good book. His ego gets in the way of every page. My understanding is that he wrote this book mainly to refutiate Into Thin Air. What a mistake, he is writing from such a defensive position how can one believe what he says. I'm sure the truth between him and Krakauer lies somewhere in the middle, but you sure won't find much of it in this book."
3,Boukreev's attempt at ego preservation,"After reading Krakauer's book, Into Thin Air, and being deeply touched by its events, I was eager to look deeper into the story of what exactly happened on the trip. What I found in Boukreev's book was not only disappointing but provided a reverse effect from what the author desired. The book is written with far less grace than its counterpart and when issues of personal fault arise in the story, Boukreev refuses to admit that the enemy was the mountain and that everyone made mistakes. The book is written more as an accusation and reputation builder than an account of a chilling and tragic experience. This is infinitely too bad as another account of the expedition that sticks to the events and the story, not to the fault of the people, might be as fascinating as the original version. This book pales in comparison to Krakauer's version."
2,very disappointing,"This book is terribly written. I didn't buy the co-authors' self-serving claims that Mr. Boukreev was slandered by Jon Krakauer's much more balanced and more carefully researched book, ""Into Thin Air."" At first glance, the crude writing and plodding documentary tone of ""The Climb"" gives it a patina of credibility, but I soon came to realize it was only a patina, resulting from DeWalt's shameless, heavy-handed attempts to manipulate his readers' sympathies. Boukreev was apparently a great climber, but after finishing this book I was convinced he had an oversize ego and an overly thin skin. To understand how Boukreev-DeWalt shamelessly distorted the facts to make their case, you only have to read Krakauer's utterly convincing rebuttal to their spurious claims, which was published in the postscript to the 1999 paperback edition of ""Into Thin Air."""
3,"A little uneven and formulaic, but sometimes poetic","So the writing in THE CLIMB is a little formulaic and uneven. But when Boukreev's real voice comes through, it can be very poignant. At one point Boukreev writes, about rescuing several climbers (not during the Everest disasters), that ""A man only gets so much luck every day; that day I used someone else's.""Moments like that, when I saw how deeply connected to the mountains and his work Boukreev was, made THE CLIMB a worthwhile read. It's also a fine counterpoint to INTO THIN AIR. Although it's not as steadily gripping or as confidently written, it answers many of Krakauer's charges and provides another look at what happened on Everest."
3,Sheeeesh.,"An interesting though extremely defensive perspective. The main thing to learn from this book is that no one is tough enough to get any old person up Everest and back. All the guides who were high on the mountain when the storm hit--Fischer, Hall, Harris--perished. Boukreev, like Biedleman, survived. Should he have behaved some other way, as some have suggested, and likely died also? Why? The expectations of the expedition and its guides were all out of whack."
3,Decent read but too defensive,I read Into Thin Air first and found it fascinating. I read this book to get a different perspective. This book spends too much time defending Boukreev. Without being there it's difficult to tell why certain things were done but both books give a good insight into what happened. Into Thin Air seems a more balanced book. The question after reading this book is why did Boukreev go down quickly to rest for a possible rescue when he had no radio to find out who to rescue or where?
3,"A good read, but highly defensive.","I read this book just days after reading ""Into Thin Air"". I would have to say that Thin Air is an easier read and is much more compelling then ""The Climb"". I found it hard to get around Boukreev's defensive posture throughout the book and found it a little convenent how much of the tragedy he pawns off on Rob Hall and Scott Fischer. For an experienced climbing guide he sure didn't act like the leader and hero he wants everyone to believe he was."
2,Hmmmm,"I'd heard a lot about this book so I was eager to read it. But now that I have, I'm not sure I see what all the fuss is about. The events the author talks about are sort of interesting but the writing is not very good. Actually the writing is really dull except for in a few chapters. Also, this Russian climber Boukreev who hired G. Dewalt to write the book, he seems really defensive, like he's got something to hide. He sure spends a lot of energy dissing John Krakauer. I guess now I'll have to read ""Into Thin Air"" to see what the deal is with that, although this book doesn't exactly make you want to read a lot more about Everest."
5,The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest,"This is a must read book and especially if you read, ""Into Thin Air"", you owe it to yourself to read this book. Every story has two sides, and this book: The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest by Anatoli Boukreev, G. Weston Dewalt, tells the other side of the 1996 disaster. It is well written and explains many missing details."
2,Short of the Summit,"The Climb gave me a new look on the '96 Tragedy other than from Krakauer and Lenne's books, so it was worth a read. However, the book should not be within the ranks of ""novel"" status. It should be among the ""counter-arguement"" ranks. It concentrates entirely too much on ""damage control"" for Anatoli and not on the climb. The book doesn't even hint that Anatoli may have been in the wrong on several occassions (because I believe there were several). There were also many instances where the author drives home the arguements that Krakauer makes in ""Into Thin Air"". Even the greatest have their moments of bad decisions... this book is one of them for the author."
3,"A good compliment to Into Thin Air, Toli needed to be heard","The Climb offered me a deeper perspective of the tragic events of the Everest summit. When I first read Krakauer's Outside article, then Into Thin Air, I thought Boukreev was betrayed rather harshly. So I was eager to hear his version. The Climb is more defensive than narrative, but with good reason. When a person's character is publicly criticized without the decency of reviewing the facts, I think it's fair to say it would be normal for anyone to be a little defensive. I liked Toli's style. He seemed very professional. I am also impressed that he went back to Everest the following spring to pay respect to Scott Fischer's and Yasouka Namba's body. I wonder what Krakauer did."
3,most interested mounteneering book,give more people's experience when climbed this mountain would give more thing to learn
1,How does he do it?,"This guy hurried down the mountain, after climbing it w/o oxygen (a stupid thing for a guide to do) and then writes a book. Read INTO THIN AIR and you will understand what he truely did."
3,Beware of possibly offensive language,"On May 10, 1996, two commercial expeditions headed by expert leaders attempted to scale the world's largest peak, but things went terribly wrong. Crowded conditions, bad judgement, and a bitter storm stopped many climbers in their tracks. Others were left for dead, or stranded on the frigid mountain. The author, head clibing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition, stepped into the heart of the storm and brought three of his clients down alive. This is his amazing story -- an expedition fated for disaster, of the blind ambition that drives people to attempt such dangerous ventures and of a modern-day hero, who risked his own life to save others.For mature readers only because of possibly offensive language."
5,Great Book,A little reverse slamage on the ol' Krauker. Great if read along with Into Thin Air and Climbing High.
2,A big ego healing story,"I had first read Into Thin Air a couple of months ago and became very interested in climbing Mt Everest and the 1996 disaster. I thought that The Climb was okay. Boukreev dishes out a lot of critiscm to climbers when they make a mistake, but is blind to his own mistakes. He makes himself seem like a hero. I thought that Into Thin Air was the best book about the 1996 disaster. Because he takes you step by step from seattle to the peak."
5,Behind the scene of a commercial expedition,"This is another story about the infamous climb of Everest that Jon Krackauer made so famous with his book ""Into Thin Air"". Anatoli Boukreev was one of the strongest climbers of all time, and he wrote this book because he was not happy about what Jon wrote about him. Although he is obviously not as good of a writer as Jon, I enjoyed his book more. His version goes behind the main scene and shows the business end and the intense logistics of a commercial expedition on a big mountain. Anatoli was the one who was up half of the night rescuing climbers while the rest of the survivors were passed out in their tents. It seems like almost everyone who was on this expedition wrote a book, but this is my favorite version. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
3,Good alternative perspective from Krakauer,"I liked this book. It is not nearly as well written as ""Into Thin Air"" but has a perspective lacking in Krakauer's account- that of experience. Anatoli Boukereev was regarded as one of the foremost climbers of his day, having summitted Everest (three times) and numerous other 8,000 meter mountains. His record is impeccable. It is distressing that Krakauer lambasted Boukereev in ""Into Thin Air"" so badly. Krakauer seriously questioned Boukereev's motives in descending ahead of the clients he was hired to guide. Yet that was the plan- as was devised by Scot Fischer, the Mountain Madness organizer and lead climber. Boukereev also single-handedly rescued three lost climbers in the height of a blizzard. I recommend this book as an adjunct to anyone who reads ""Into Thin Air""."
4,Boukreev's POV,"I had first read Krakauer's Into Thin Air - an astonishing, well-written, and sensational account of the 1996 season on Everest - which started my interest in mountaineering memoirs and in Everest stories, in particular. I purchased The Climb with great anticipation about a separate, ""rebuttal"" point of view, and was not disappointed. Whatever your opinion about what happened in 1996, it is hard not to respect and admire Boukreev after reading this. Sure, the writing is not as polished as Krakauer's book, but I was still turning pages as quickly as possible. Even a completely non-narrative, factual account of the goings-on in 1996 at the roof of the world would be gripping. As a singular book, I think The Climb absolutely can stand on its own. As one in a series on Everest 1996, the story becomes even more compelling."
4,Egos Clash At 8000 meters,"I found The Climb to be a good companion to Krakauer's Into Thin Air. While I don't believe Krakauer singled out Boukreev (he cast a pretty wide net including himself), I can understand the defensive posture taken in The Climb. After all, Boukreev didn't make his living by pointing fingers. Guiding was his livelyhood.I think that in the final analysis, Boukreev didn't leave the summit too early; everyone but Krakauer left too late. Had he known the clients were gonna dilly-dally on their way to the summit, perhaps he would've used supplemental oxygen. Since he didn't and they did, I suspect he had little choice but to go down 'early.'I'm glad Boukreev took the time to defend himself. I found many of the details he provides fascinating. I found him fascinating. I'm sorry that he's gone, and I'm sorry he felt it necessary to co-author this book."
2,The defensive tone of this book is a big negative.,"One point I'd like to make is that NO ONE knows the full extent of everything that happened up on Everest that day. Not Krakauer, not Boukreev, NO ONE. It's laughable for a reader to say that one account is more accurate.Having said that, I think that the overall defensive tone of The Climb gets old quickly. While The Climb offers a fresh perspective and new insights, it would've been much more enjoyable if the authors did not spend so much effort trying to refute Krakauer's account. At least Krakauer was willing to admit his mistakes."
3,Authentic account of the Tragedy in everest,From his own words Jon Krakauer was not in a position to evaluate the incidents . He should have stuck to the facts rather than accusing boukereev without even bothering to get the other side of the story.Boukereev's account appears to be genuine .
2,A great story but a poor book,"I was underwhelmed by this book, which is surprising given that the story of the Everest debacle is a natural page-turner. Boukreev comes across as the least-blameworthy of several blameworthy mountain guides. Reading a story like this make you wonder why any sane person would try to climb Everest."
4,"An engaging rebuttal to Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air""","Although it was not as well written as Krakauer's book, ""The Climb..."" was more engaging, more honest. Anatoli Boukreev, the veteran climber/guide on Scott Fischer's ""mountain madness"" expedition to Everest in May 1996 has been widely described as the most capable and experienced high altitude climber on the mountain. Boukreev's rescue of 5 climbers above 8,000 meters, detailed in his own words -- is riveting. This book also refutes many of John Krakauer's assertions from ""Into Thin Air"". When the snow hit the proverbial fan, Boukreev went back up the mountain on three solo rescue attempts - while Krakauer slept in his tent."
4,Excellent Book about a Trategy on Everest,"I don't understand Mr. Carpenter's review. Aftre reading ""Into Thin Air"" I was interested in reading Boukreev's story. I must admit I started the book with a pre-conseption that Boukreeve was going to write an appology and mabe try to attack or dismiss Krakau's (sp?) accounts of his actions on the moutain. I am convinced that Anatoli did the best he could under the circunstances and while Krakau sleep, Anatoli made severl attempts and succeded in saving at least three lives. While not wishing to attack Mr. Krakau's action on the moutain I do believe that Analoti Boukreev's actions were truly heroic that day. The book while a bit appologetic is very well done. It keep me very interested in the events and help me get a different prespective of the tragic events on Everest in 1996."
3,A detailed retelling of a familiar tragedy,"In ""The Climb"", authors Anatoli Boukreev and G. Weston DeWalt team up to give their version of the terrible events on Mount Everest in May 1996. Readers of Jon Krakaur's ""Into Thin Air"" are already familiar with the outlines of this story, told from the viewpoint of another climbing team. This book is different in that it is a much more controlled, exhaustivley researched tale. In fact,the authors strain to include lots of detail, as if it was a gaduate school research paper. This detracts a little from the story, which is otherwise nicely told. Another objective of theirs was to vindicate the actions of the Russian climber Boukreev, who was criticized in Krakauer's book as being self-serving, when in fact he ended up saving several climbers' lives. There is a chapter near the end on an unrelated climb which seemed out of place, but the last chapter was very moving. Worth a read."
4,Interesting read,I saw that people that read Into Thin Air recommended this book as well. I decided to take a look and found in interesting when comparing the two. Definitely worth your time! Check it out.[...]
3,Mountain Madness without oxygen,"In order to understand a little the unresponsibilty of bringing commercial expeditions to the top of the world, you should read 'The Climb' and also Krakauer's 'Into thin air'. Written from different perspectives both books show very impressive that the 14 mountains over 8000 m should be reserved to the professional climbers and should not serve as the stage for ego-trips of well paying exentric customers. While Krakauer shows that he is the more experienced author, Boukreev and his ghost-writer give some deeper insights concerning the motivation and the economic pressure of the heads of the Everest expedition, Hall and Fisher. For me as an occasional climber in the European alps it is very clear, there is no mountain so important, that it would justify the loss of your health or your live."
4,"A must read for anyone who read ""Into Thin Air""","Very interesting complement to ""Into Thin Air"". This book is much less emotional, in that it focuses less on the pain and hardship associated with high altitude climbing, and instead is more of a chronicle of what happened from Boukreev's perspective, as well as from interviews with many others who were there. In many ways, it's a documentary-style rebuttal to Krakauer's portrayal of Boukreev, who was clearly responsible for saving the lives of at least 3 climbers. It's interesting, however, to also read Krakauer's counter rebuttal and then decide for yourself: was Boukreev a hero who saved lives, a seflish, stubborn climber who jeopardized them, or both?"
4,A great story that is superbly written,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" I wasn't sure what to expect from ""The climb"". But shortly after starting to read this book I found that it was superbly written. The story keeps moving and the reader almost has a sense that they are there experiencing the tragic events that took place on Mt. Everest in May, 1996. Although Krakauer and Boukreevs stories about what exectly happened during the expidition differ ""The Climb"" is just written so much better than ""Into Thin air"" which helps to lend to it's accuracy. Time was taken to interview many of the survivors of the Everest Expiditions. If any one wants a thouroghly enjoyable read that grabs you and doesn't let you go than you need to read ""The Climb""."
2,"A Different Perspective, but...","This is an interesting read in terms of fleshing out details surrounding the May '96 Everest tradgedy. There is a ton of detailed info for anyone curious about the expidition(s) in question or high altitude mountaineering in general. Unfortunately it is quite poorly written. The narrative constantly changes from third person (DeWalt) to first person (Boukreev) and while neither are particularly eloquent, read together the prose is a practically schizophrenic.The tone of the narrative is also very defensive. Boukreev clearly produced this book in response to John Krakouer's ""Into Thin Air"" which was critical of his actions at times. I have no interest in taking sides in this debate. I do enjoy learning about the intracies of mountaineering and simply enjoying a good book. ""The Climb"" delivers in the former respect and fails miserably in the latter."
4,Mistakes Were Repeated,"What amazed me about The Climb was that Boukreev repeated many of the same mistakes in his 1997 Everest expedition, summitting with an inexperienced Indonesian group after 3:00 p.m. While he did establish a Camp 5 at 8,500 meters, he would not have made it back to that camp with all climbers had he faced either the weather or health problems that occurred on May 10, 1996. And then Boukreev kills himself in an avalanche. I think all these people have a death wish."
5,Suspenseful and Spellbinding,"I found the book extremely powerful and heartwrenching. Once I started to read it I could not keep it down. In light of the fact that the events at Everest on May 10, 1996 did happen and with tragic consequences, I feel that rawness of the writing makes it even more real and foreboding. The tension is sustained until the shattering climax. Boukreev did appear to be at times emphatic and defensive about his role at the summit which I think was forced by the allegations in ""Into Thin Air"". While recognizing why he would want to do so I feel that reference to ""Into Thin Air"" was not necessary. This book has a great story and drama of its own and classifying it as a rebuttal to ""Into Thin Air"" only minimizes its value. All controversies aside one should not ignore - how the clients of ""mountain madness"" fared in the end. That I feel is the ultimate truth."
5,Mellow melloncholic acoustics for a tierd man,"This album is quite possibly the most moving and meaning - laden musical experience I have ever encountered. It is not hard to see (after one listen) why Bernardo Bertolucci used ""You won't fall"" in his inspired film Stealing Beauty. If you are a guitarist, you may find your eyes widening at the innovative picking style of Carsons many guest guitarists. This combined with the flowing piano melodies create a haunting, airy and 100% fulfilling musical experience. Listen to it now!"
3,Fabulous Felted Hand-Knits,"There are 30 patterns in this book, 3 of which I will use. In the first section, there are patterns for pincushions and hot pads,etc which do introduce knitters to felting but, as an experienced knitter, I find a waste of time. In a later section there are more complicated patterns but somr involve advanced sewing techniques that I don't have. The gorgeous purse on the cover is one of those. Nowhere in the review does it mention this requirement. Also ( the reason I purchased the book) there is a pattern for a simple cloche hat that knits up fast BUT in order to execute the overlay pattern, I must ""chain stitch the stem, stem stitch the curling vines & straight stitch the flowers."". Now that sounds easy, doesn't it?"
2,Visit the library first,"I checked this out from our library before purchasing, and I'm glad I did. There was not a single pattern I am interested in making. The hats--my main interest--look like they were designed by someone who learned to knit 6 months ago. There are so many better felting books and patterns out there--keep searching."
4,"It ""Felt"" Well","Well written with good instructions. Some of the info contradicts other advice (ie.... wool/acrylic combinations can be felted, which may or may not be true, depending on the individual products.) Had a nice width of possible projects but I was wishing for a few more hats. All over.... a good book and the supplier gave a precise description of the condition of the book."
3,Fablous Felted Knits,"This book has some interesting patterns in it. However, I find the construction somewhat off putting."
2,Poor tape,"Having just traveled to Ireland, I was interested in the history. The story is great and the shipping was fast, however, the last 45 minutes of the tape was bad. It was scratchy, hesitant and the audio was poor. Since this was the real heart of the movie, it was very distracting. The only reason I purchased the tape was that there were no DVDs available."
3,An Introduction to a Time of Troubles,"""Michael Collins"" tells the story of one of Ireland's great patriots, who as a young man had a part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and then battled the British guerilla-style up through the establishment of the Free State before being murdered himself.Liam Neeson does a fine job as Collins, but there are two BAD performances in the film which hurt its overall effectiveness. First, Julia Roberts does a terrible job as the woman Collins loves. Bad brogue and just bad attitude. Then Alan Rickman, who I thought did splendid work in ""Sense and Sensibility"" is perfectly horrid as Eamonn DaValera. The scene where he makes an imprint of his jail key is so ludicrous, it looked like camp. Also, the film suggests that DaValera had a hand in Collins' murder, which undercuts the importance of DaValera himself as an Irish patriot, long-time President of the country.Best for Neeson and daring escapes from the Black and Tans."
4,excellent,"This film is brilliantly acted, Rickman a very covincing Dev, and Nesson brilliant as the mercurial Collins.Only one problem I wish it was not so inacurate, Ned Broy was not killed he went on to be Garda Commissioner; and Harry Boland was not chased through the Dublin sewers, he was killed in an Hotel in Howth.Having said that the film was enjoyable and beautifully shot."
4,very good,"If you like this sort of thing it's very good. Action, romance history and Liam, what is not to like."
2,Falls short.,"I wanted this to be a great movie but it definitely fell short. Ratherthan weaving an engrossing story I thought this was more of a series ofscenes strung together for historical accuracy. Maybe it was the directing or maybe it was the way it was edited - it just seemed hollow. The acting fell short for me as well, which is disappointing with such a great cast. Too bad - lots of material to work with."
5,A great story and one of my favourite movies,"When you think that Michael Collins was only 31 when he died his story is all the more amazing. Jordan has done a brilliant job in covering the complex character of Collins - a leader, a terrorist and yet a man of peace."
1,need them replaced,"i didn't know what ""regions"" were all about...it's the wrong region and doesn't work...ALSO....it's the second Michael Collins"" i've bought from you because the first one cuts out every time with 20 minutes to go in the movie....it's not the machine....i've informed you of this twice and have gotten no response.....d.lewis"
3,This Is Not A Documentary...,"...It's a historical drama. There's a big difference. This should be re-classified. I'm sure the material is historically accurate, but the scenes are re-enactments."
5,Great Movie!,"If you would like to learn more about the great Michael Collins, this is the movie for you. The actress playing his girlfriend is the weakest part of the movie. I believe this movie is somewhat based on the book, Michael Collins, The Man Who Made Ireland. If you can, read the book and see the movie together. The book is so compelling, you may need to reread it. I did!"
2,Michael Collins poor quality of a DVD,"To put it bluntly, the DVD freezes up many times throughout the movie. I've sent messages to the seller without any replies. I would not recommend making any purchases from this company.Z"
1,i like the movie but this dvd was a rip-off,"I saw this movie a few years ago & enjoyed it so I chose it for my final in a class that analyzed 'historical' movies. When I got this dvd, the main menu was non-existant [it goes straight to the movie], side B was blank & I had no special features. I was unable to see the last 10 sceens of the film or any special features b/c side B was blank. Sure I could return it but that doesn't really solve the problem that I had a 10 page paper where I could not analyze the end of the movie."
2,recommended before traveling to Ireland,"I watched this movie in preparation for a trip to Dublin, per a recommendation from the Rick Steve's series to assist in understanding recent history of Ireland. While we were in Dublin, we met two teenage girls who said they were required to watch the movie in school for the same reason."
4,"Fierce, bitter, violent journey back to the birth of Ireland","Liam Neeson leads a band of IRA fighters through the bitter years which led up to the birth of the modern Irish nation.Faced with circumstances that require Collins (Neesom)to reinvent the revolution in the face of harsh British resolve, Collins determines that violence, in whatever unsporting form may be required, will become the singular mechanism by which the Irish people will forever force the hated British out of their isle.A powerful music score combines with a great dedication to detail and sweeping direction to recreate 1920's Dublin on the silver screen.Another towering performance by Neesom and a veteran cast, including a low key Julia Roberts. END"
4,Liam Neeson Shines as Collins,This is a well produced and well written film that tells the story of Michael Collins and the Irish Rebellion and subsequent civil war with great historical accuracy and drama. Liam Neeson is unforgettable in a role he is absolutely perfectly cast in as Michael Collins. Most of the rest of the cast does very well with the exception of Julia Roberts who seems out of her league here but mercifully doesn't hinder the enjoyment of the film all that much.The tensions that erupt between Collins and Eamon De Valera (Alan Rickman)form the heart of the film. It is a chapter in Irish history that lends itself well to dramatic treatment and the film lives up to it's raw material.Nice work from director Neil Jordan.
2,Needs More Backstory,"I only knew the name Michael Collins before watching this film and now I know of his exploits, but I could have used some more backstory instead of ""700 years of struggle."" Like why Liam Neeson's Collins and Aidan Quinn's Harry Boland are such great friends and why Alan Rickman's Eamon de Valera fear the both of them working together on the Irish Republican cause. So, my Irish history is rusty and this movie helps fill in some gaps, but I think more of the history of these folks struggle should have been shown.Julia Roberts' Kitty Kiernan is character who needed further development or she should have hit the cutting room floor. Why is she involved in the cause? Who does she love Michael or Harry? Is she a country lass or a city woman? Why is she in the film again? To me, it seemed like the actors were not as immersed in their roles as they should have been."
3,Unspectacular,"I expected a little more from this movie but after 20 minutes of this movie, I realized it was just another dull british drama. Michael Collins is a good movie to see if you want to gain a little knowledge of Irish history. However, there is unfortunately little else of note that makes this movie worth sitting for two hours. Aside from the very talented Stephen Rea's work, the acting is terrible. Aidan Quinn seems to forget at times that he's supposed to have an Irish accent, and even when he remembers his accent sounds terrible. It is an important story, but difficult to translate to film, and Jordan did what he could with his resources. In the hands of a lesser writer/director, the film could have been disastrous. If you really have nothing else to do, it wouldn't hurt to watch this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece. Julia Roberts was a huge miscast in this film.. very poor choice. Someone tell this woman that she CANNOT do accents."
2,Ground Breaking Terrorism,Collins is nothing more than an early version of Che Guevera. As his legacy he leaves IRA terrorism which is arguably the prototype for today's world problems. Why does the movie industry insist on glorifying these people? I say good riddance.
2,"educational, but boring as hell","this movie had great potential, but unfortunately didn't live up to it. the info in the movie was interesting, but was directed so badly that it couldn't be good. it started out so suddenly that you couldnt be drawn into it.what was up with julia roberts? she can't keep up an irish accent to save her life. if you want a documentarish movie youll like this. but if you want an awesome movie about ireland check out some mothers son or the boxer."
1,"Great movie, poor, poor, poor dvd",Have to flip the disc to see the last 15 minutes? give me a break. Wait for the special release. I should've.
4,It was a hit as a gift,"We purchased two of these as gifts and the recipients seemed very happy to have them, and intrigued by all the detail in the piece."
5,jim Shore-Angel Nativity,5 Star Service and item. I have bought this or a similar jim shore Item as a wedding/Shower gift several times. Wonderful Christmas decor for a New Couple.. or anyone... Brightly colored Angel with nativity scene on Skirt.. Well Made and well liked by receivers. Great service in ordering and receiving product in timely manner. I have paid more than 1/3 more in the local gift shops for this item.
5,You will want to play it over and over.,"Out of all of my cd's, (over 300), this is in the top 5. Every track is good, and you won't want to skip anything. It's good while driving, cooking, or being alone with someone."
4,"Smokin' Hot, deeply inner-city decadent","Good, adult, sleepin' in the City and makin' love (***MAKINNN.... LOOOOVE!***) music. The women's voices are smokin' hot and the varied and tasteful arrangements are strong throughout. Probably Anton Fier's best record with this crew. Recommended chillout music. Not for the kids, though. :D"
1,Poor information,This book was a big disappointment to me. The information previously provided on OCD was deleted. The subject was really ignored. Is there a sudden cure for this disease? Tell me that OCD does not have an anxiety component. I would like to return this book as it is useless to me.
3,Difficult and worth it,"Language has power and we are foolish if we do not believe that perception is at least as important as reality. While there is much here that is difficult to process the concept of the terministic screen is a very worth while one and deserves special attention if you want to get a handle on anything you need to get a handle on the terminology used to describe, define or even hide it. Drawing on the concept of the Terministic screen in my own bookStone Soup: The Secret Recipe for Making Something from Nothingwas essential to explain how we change our perceptions through language even though our reality has been unchanged and yet the way we relate to this unchanged reality through our altered perception can be the difference between success and failure."
2,Did not hold up,The valve went after just a few months. Had to throw it away and get a different model that didn't have the handle.
4,My favorite watering device,"I do a lot of hand watering of my Hostas and this is my favorite tool. The Dramm is well made and the Touch N Flow can't be beat for convenience. This is the second one I've owned. My first one lasted a year, when the Touch N Flow jammmed. I think this was because I left it outside for the winter. This year I will store it in my garage after frost and put a drop of oil on the Touch N Flow moving parts before storing it for the winter. However, It's such an improvement over using a shut off valve, that I would buy another Touch N Flow piece (these can be ordered separately) if it breaks again."
2,"Broke, but warranted, but they're pieces of cr@p","I bought two. I had the same issue as the other reviewer. The shut off no longer shuts off completely. They replaced one, but didn't send a head.I'm now trying to process the replacement of my other one. Do not buy these. When they work, they're fine, but both of mine worked for less than 3 months.These are relatively too expensive to work for such a short amount of time.I kept them out of the sun, etc. Just a piece of junk."
1,threads are junk,Brand new and it leaks at the hose joint. The threads are some cheap pot metal. If you try to tighten enough to stop the leak it will strip. Even worse the thread metal will redox react with a brass hose eroding the joint. Looks good but is otherwise worthless.
1,Okay. Not great.,"First, the order didn't come for a few weeks. To Amazon's great credit when I complained they responded immediately and a new order was placed and arrived the next day. The wand itself works okay but the head on it has no adjustment and isn't a great spray for our uses. It does allow for a different head to be put on which I did. It was a fair amount of money for something that doesn't adjust."
2,"Worked great for a couple months, then valve got stuck open","The wand worked pretty well for while. Then pieces started falling off and eventually the valve got stuck in the open position so you can't stop the flow of water. And just a minor annoyance, but the stickers on the unit have some ungodly adhesive that simply won't come off if you peel the sticker off."
3,Interesting but hard to read,"This book has interesting, lively analysis and examples. However, it is hard to read for a number of reasons. Some of them (complex sentences, loose organization) have been pointed out by other reviewers). There is another flaw, which is particularly annoying if you want to use the book as a reference: the author tends to jump into a new section without a roadmap for the reader or a connection with earlier sections. As a result, it is hard to start reading a new section without first reading the preceding section."
1,Worst textbook I've ever used,"I offer this review solely as a warning to anyone thinking of buying this book. STOP!! It is poorly organized, with distributions and theorems hidden in different examples. There is no coherency in the structure. The author appears intent on proving his skill with mathematical tricks which betray the usefulness of any examples. The problems are ludicrous or frivolously complicated. I am using this book in a graduate econometrics course, and the only reason I'm passing is because I've got other mathematical statistics books to refer to."
4,"great, but far from elementary","This is a great book in that it has a lot of solved examples, plus many good exercises with answers. But it is very far from being elementary. Once you think you understand basic discrete math very well (by studying from different books), you can use this book as a challenge of your knowledge."
4,exceptional music...,"I would happily give this CD five stars if only the recording quality were better. This is mesmerising, inspiring, can't-keep-still, traditional music, and I would have given a whole lot to be at the session when this CD was made. It is a necessity for any African music collection just the same. Check out their other CDs. Drums for Tomorrow has a contemporary twist, but altogether it's a successful marriage of styles."
4,Well worth the money,"I originally bought the Mi-Del cookies at a local odd-lots store over a year ago. I felt a sense of loss after the store stopped carrying them, since no other local grocer stocked them. So I was glad to see that they were available, albeit in bulk quantities only, via Amazon. I love these cookies, and best of all, they're about as healthy as you can find anywhere. I have to watch my intake of saturated fats, and per 5-cookie serving, the Mi-Del snaps have zero grams of sat-fat. They're delicious, with a nice, somewhat subdued chocolate flavor and a crunchy snap. I keep them in the fridge and they maintain their freshness for MONTHS. Twelve packages may seem like a lot, but I look forward to devouring every one of them. I've also tried the vanilla and lemon snaps, and they're equally outstanding."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I've seen these for sometime in my local grocery store, but was reluctant to buy them. From the packaging they look hard and tasteless. It turns out that they are the perfect amount of softness to dip into English tea and still hold up. And they taste wonderful. Love them."
5,fantastic!,i have to agree that these are delicious tasty cookies. i'm not a vegan & i don't have a problem eating gluten. i just like yummy cookies & these cookies are yummy!
4,Good cookies!,"These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems. The ingredients are mostly organic and they are sweetened with dehydrated can juice, as opposed to the less-healthy commercial alternatives.Now, for the problem: I have never found these cookies in a market near me, and we have only purchased them through Amazon. Because these wonderful cookies are not pumped-up with weird chemical preservatives, the necessity of purchasing them in such big lots means that you are going to be eating a lot of cookies in a short period of time, or going in with a friend on sharing the case! However, given the high quality of this product, you should have no problem splitting up the order.Yummy and highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Cookies!,These cookies are excellent. They are crisp and delicious and have a great gingery taste. I agree with the comment that it's easy to eat the whole bag. They really are that good.
2,Good Cookies & crumbs & Bad Expire Date,These cookies are great if you eat all 12 bags within 2 months! It expires in less than 2 months!Also about 20% of bag is crumbs! Bad shipping & packing on Amazon! BEWARE!
2,"Not Very Chocolately, A disappointing texture and flavor","I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy."
2,Not My Idea of Vanilla Snaps,"I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty. Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency. They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case. As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry."
1,OK,These cookies are hard & somewhatlacking in taste. We threw out half the bag.Mostly because my children did not likeginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these.
1,Blah,"Good aroma, good mouth feel, but the taste...flavorless. Like a crunchy lump of flour. Might help if they put some ginger in it."
5,What a great cookie!,"My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew. If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good). Snappy, even. :)I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland. For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies."
4,Monsta Jamz,"Great R&B muisc, brings back memories of the old school jamz. Most of the songs were good and there were 3 songs that I didn't like because they either gave me bad memories or I just didn't know that particular song. Its nice that you get 2 CDS at such a low price."
2,Am I missing Something Here?,"I ordered this because Amazon listed 18 songs from the 90's that I truly enjoyed.......however the CD only has 15 of those songs. Further when the Windows Media Player reads the disc, the title that appears on the screen is not always what is actually playing and some of the songs that are read when using Window Media Player aren't even on the Disc. Razor and Tie Direct did not do a good job compiling this CD"
4,Good tracks here,most of these song I truly dig&can bump to.most of the Acts featured here aren't Album Artists or Acts to me but as far as Cool Jams to Bump to it's good.
2,In pursuit of what?,"I tried to like this CD I really did, it seemed the hype is what sold me on it. ON U Sound's AHC, is at best a hybrid of things, but roots reggae is not their forte. They seem to walk a fine line of ambient dub, nyabinghi sounds and chants. However, with all that fine mixing, I still felt no real depth to In Pursuit.It sounded like alot of tribal mix matching with splashes of reggae in it. Not exactly classic material here."
5,Highly recommended,"Divination is a cornerstone on the path of Ifa'Orisa that provides inisght, clarity, and guidance on one's path. Since I have applied the information that Baba Osundiya presented, I've reached a deeper connection to the divine forces(orisa) and my ancestors (egun), my life has improved markedly. This well-written manual continues to be a blessing by providing a resource that will enable me to build and maintain a firm foundation for my interactions and spiritual practices with the divine.I highly recommend this book for anyone who practice any branch of the Orisa tradition. This book is easy to read thereby allowing a non-initiate to move through each step with ease and understanding and providing initates with a tool to perfect their divination skills. This small investment will pay for itself time and time again.Ire ati alaafia"
2,"Well made, but OEM is much higher quality","This filter while constructed of quality materials, is inferior to OEM original made by Helsatech. This MANN filter features pleated media with activated charcoal coating. OEM factory original is noticeably heavier and literally constructed like a sponge.Filtering element on OEM original by Helsatech is noticeably superior."
3,"Nice, but. . .","Most of the selections were also in the same editor's two-volume set BEST OF SACRED MUSIC, and as far as I could tell were not even different arrangements (as was done with JOY JOY JOY).As with the other books, I missed the lack of any sort of user-aids or suggested registrations for organ."
4,"Very, very good","Surprised to (finally) have found a chill-out cd from the likes of Nick Warren. Nick Warren typically delivers the goods in the manner of absolutely amazing trance, as is evident if you take even a passing glance at any of his GU releases (particularly ""Amsterdam"" and ""Live in Prague""). But, like everyone else, even NW needs his down-time. Enter, this release.If you're already familiar with the Back to Mine series, you know what to expect. This is laid-back, chilled-out, sitting in your favorite chair, laying on your favorite couch, lying in your favorite bed (with your favorite person, of course), and even sitting poolside, beachside, or window-side as it rains. Smoothed out vibes, slightly trippy beats, delicious altogether.Very worth having and very worth the import price (if you order it off here).Also check out Groove Armada's effort in this series, as well as that of Faithless. Both of those are extremely good."
3,Good.,This Cd is good. It is ok to get chill and enjoy nice music. You can feel Nick Warren's touch. I liked more cd1 of GU 30 Paris from Nick.
5,Unwind Here,"Perfect for any occasion that demands music, but none of the nonsense of pop or hard electronic music.Reading on the couch by yourself when it's 35 degrees outside and inside? Sure.Playing outside as the sun goes down? As the sun comes up? Sure on both counts.Unwinding from a stressful day? You bet.I am reminded of a line in ""Hey Ya"" right now. What's cooler than cool? The right answer isn't ice cold. The answer is this cd."
5,chilled to the bone,"I love this album , when you need to relax or just clear your head of more upbeat stuff , this is the medicine . songs like autumn leaves (sic) never seem to get going and that is just what I need sometimes . Space music for lack of a better word . i have no clue what his normal style is ( I gather its house ) but this is all I'll ever want from mister nick warren ."
4,Great shoes at a good price,I've had these shows for about 2 weeks now and so far so good. They're quite comfortable and look good. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is I'm not sure how well they'll hold up. I'll return in 6 months and let you know.
1,Pistol Grip Shotgun Spring Airsoft Rifle,"this shotgun sucks it broke the first day i got it, also it falls apart and the mini pistol dont get me started the clip broke the first day i got it too. and no its not due to bad handling its due to cheap ass plastic.John Doe"
2,i would not recamend this item,the gun is made plastic andwould be very easy to snap in half.the free pistol broke 2 days after i got it so that gun is pretty much useless.the only good thing was the price.
4,Enjoyable but not her best,"Anne Ashley is one of my favorite Regency writers. Her stories move fast and are closely knitted. I enjoy all her books but I think "" The Neglectful Guardian"" is the best. The heroine is a minx and her antics keep me chuckling."
4,the reference text,A specialist book with good taxonomy and excellent line drawings. Still the reference text after 50 years.
5,Best love story,"I watched this on TV more than 10 years ago and loved it so much! And I've been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time. I hope Amazon.com can provide us the English version or at least Italian version with English subtitles on DVD NOT on Video Tapes!!! Amazon.de has the German version DVDs in stock, but Amazon.com provides only VHS? A lot of people are looking for the English version DVD on internet nowadays, I'm one of them, and we're still waiting..."
3,Ebbs and flows,"3 1/2As with almost all similar records of the virtuoso's live improvised solo performances, Vienna has its peaks and valleys- enough to excite followers but not entirely persuade newcomers. The clean, more restrained, darker melodic meditations account for one of his most polished performances, but can stall from theoretical similarities to his other works which cannot ensure this hands-down-best."
3,Not the one to start with,"If you are a hard core Jarret collector, as I am, then this is an important piece. Apparently Jarret states that it is his favourite solo concert. Why, I would love to understand, its my least favourite. If you are starting with Jarret Solo recordings then head for Paris, La Scala, Koln and the best of all the Lausanne double CD. But like all things Jarret, there is magic here too, however, there is more magic elsewhere."
3,Technical wizardry,"Yes, Keith Jarrett is a wonder. In this album, as in others, his technical prowess at the piano is amazing. At times, it seems as though there are two, perhaps three, pianists playing simultaneously. The problem here, as in similar solo improvisational albums, is that the technique is an end in itself. There is little beauty, wit, or thoughtfulness. Listening to this often painful album is like watching a world's strongest man contest. Wow, look at those hulks move weights. But what does it prove? And after you've seen it a couple of times, who cares any more? Jarrett is at his best, in my opinion, when facing a score. His The Melody At Night, With You is one of the most gorgeous and sensitive albums I know of. He also plays splendid Bach and Handel. Don't buy the Vienna concert until you've heard, say, a half hour's worth. If you can fight off the headache, make the purchase. Caveat emptor."
5,One of the all-time favourite records,"I was obsessed by Jarrett's playing for many years and while now I can find myself irritated by the enormous ego and its sometimes stultifying effect on his music, Vienna Concert remains for me a sublime creation which made a profound impact on me the first time I heard it. More than in any of Jarrett's other solo concerts, the capacity for waywardness is kept in check and he delivers a marvellously focused performance, synthesising styles that would seem to be irreconcilable into an inevitable whole. As a professional classical pianist, I'm tempted to say that of all piano records I've heard, this one has been the most influential."
3,great music bad quality,I liked this movie and the artists in it so it felt like a sure thing when i bought it. the quality of the music on the cd is kinda weak and is sad because i really liked the movie.
3,NO Cody ChesnuTT?,"I am a bit disappointed this album doesn't have one of the most serious scenes in the movie. When Cody ChesnuTT was singing acoustically even Dave Chappelle's face straightened as it was an emotional part per say of the movie. Other then that the cd is good, as other people have already stated the obvious of who was forgotten to be put on this soundtrack. They could have put more movie quotes/lines along with the performances like done with alot of soundtracks."
3,Good but missing key performances!,"No Fugees, No Kanye West, No Talib Kweli ""Get By"" featuring Mos Def and Common. It's a good CD, but would have been so much better with these performances!"
4,Dave Chappelle Throws A Party,"The soundtrack to Dave Chappelle's Block Party with hip hop acts that put on great live performances. The Roots are the stars of the album with some first rate songs including the amazing ""You Got Me"" that has both Erykah Badu (who sang on the original) and the flawless Jill Scott (who co-wrote the song) and ""Boom"" with a great teaming of hip hop pioneers Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap. Mos Def and Talib Kweli reunite as Blackstar and perform some solo songs. Not all the artist from the event are included on the album most notably Kanye West and The Fugees who reunited for the event."
3,Hmmmmmm Where is Kanye and The Fugees?,I loved the movie and the soundtrack is descent. However where is Kanye West and the Fugees on this soundtrack. A major draw for the movie was to see the fugees perform together again why were they not included on the soundtrack? The sound track is still good despite their absence but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't make the final cut.
3,Solid Performance,"This CD is taken from only one night's performance(as opposed to taking it from several, which many artists are doin these days). That in itself is a testament to the quality of live show that Mr. Barretto puts on.All the cuts on this CD are well-crafted and full of energy. Song selection is good, though I definitely prefer Disc 1 to Disc 2. While Adalberto Santiago has sounded better, Yolanda Rivera is who this CD could have definitely done without. She sounds like some drunk at karaoke night. I can hardly stand to listen to the (fortunately few) tracks she's featured on. With her at home and Mr. Santiago singin' better, this CD could've been a five star smash!"
3,50th anniversary review,"It's good to see Ray Barretto back together with his original singers. Most of the songs on this cd are classic Barretto cuts from the 70's. Some of the standouts on this cd are ""El hijo de Obatala"" and ""Indestructible,"" which feature Tito Allen on lead vocals. My biggest disappointment was the fact that one of my all-time favorite soneros Adalberto Santiago puts up a lowsy performance throughout the album. Still, this cd is worth having."
1,Disappointing,"We ordered mermaid version guitar and were told it wasn't available by the seller, they offered to exchange for the fairy version in pink.It arrived looking like it had spent a month under someones bed, dirty (actual dust bunnies on the frets!), the design missing half of it's paint and color. I called and after getting the run around was assured we would be refunded and wouldn't have to pay shipping back to seller. Seller then emailed to ask us to remove negative feedback. I originally left this feedback on the mermaid version of this guitar, you can't see that page anymore so I decided to leave it here. Disappointed! We reordered the same guitar from a different seller and the quality was orders of magnitude better."
3,great sound,"Great sounding guitar, but not as advertised. The moon phases are stickers, but are advertised as frets. I was very disappointed to find out that all the moon designs are cheap stickers and start to fall off almost immediately. One of the main reason I chose this guitar for my daughter was because of the moon phase frets. It is her first guitar and I was hoping it would be a keepsake, but I am afraid the construction quality might not hold up with constant use. :/ The only really good thing is that the sound is beautiful! :)"
4,Too big for a 5 year old,"I was misled by other reviews that it would be perfect for a 5 year old. But I realized it is too big for a 5 year old. Though the item is good, I wouldn't suggest it for a 5 year old. Probably 8 years and up..."
3,My (daughter's) first guitar,"We purchased this guitar for our 5 year old daughter's first foray into guitar playing. The problem we ran into was this: you either buy a 30 dollar piece of junk, or a $350, serious guitar. Since she's 5, we were on the lookout for something in the middle of the range. Luna is apparently a company that makes guitars only for girls, and so we gave them a whirl. The guitar is OK- doesn't have great sound, but it is tunable and her guitar teacher can play it and make it sound pretty good. It's mainly plastic- not a lot of wood, if any. Bear in mind, this is a ""my first"" type of instrument that won't break the bank and will last long enough to see if your little rocker will hang in there with the lessons. The fairy is cute- a totally girly guitar, without a doubt! Just not an heirloom, by any stretch. We'll probably upgrade her in about a year."
2,not good enough,"bad acting yes, good music yes,but they could of done better on this movie.i dunno about this one borrow it or burn it maybe but buying is waste of money,if you like dance music,electronica the soundtrack isnt that bad though."
2,Bad acting!,it wasnt even good enough to watch straight through.. bad acting.. and i mean badddd.. which is suprising since i like both seth green and mukuli culkin.what a disappointment.
1,What a piece of crap!,"I only gave this movie 1 star because there was no way to give it zero stars. I hated this movie. Absolutely hated it. And I only watched about a half hour of it. I've never walked out of a movie or stopped watching a movie that I rented - even if I didn't like it. But after 30 minutes of this trash I turned it off. It was horrible! The acting was horrible and it was just plain stupid. I'm fairly indifferent to Seth Green as an actor...but what was he doing in this nonsense? People say that he made a good drag queen, but they're wrong. He and Macaulay Culkin were terrible at acting like gay guys. Gay guys don't even act like that! They tried to make their speech/mannerisms look natural, but they actually looked like they were SPOOFING gay guys. It looked like something that should have been a skit on Saturday Night Live. I think this movie is offensive to gay guys everywhere. Please....I BEG you....do NOT watch this movie! In case I didn't mention it...it sucked!"
2,Without substance or anything at all really,"Seth Green is the only actor in the movie. Everyone else is trying to act.I give two stars because the costumes were fantastic and so was the make up.I wanted to give no stars because too many things were trying to get covered in too little time.Did anyone really understand Gitzies importance? Or why the club kids went on tour? I did, but only because I knew the story before I saw the movie...maybe that's why I'm so upset with this production."
3,Party like it's 1992!!!!!!! (?),"The only movie you will EVER hear a ""Stacy Q"" song AND see Micauly Caulkins bootie. Too much for any one man or woman to handle."
1,Whats so amazing about this film?,"This is simply an attempt at making something artistic, which it is not. The acting is horrible, and the story is lame. I fell asleep watchning this. Don't waste your time and money on this steamy pile of crap."
3,The Rise and Fall of Disco 2000,"Macaully Culking never comes close to the real Micahel Alig. The real Micahel Alig was creepy and hollow. That aside, this movie tries to capture the color and mayhem of the Club Kid Era. (For those that were around then, well, nothing will ever come close.) Seth Green steals the movie as James St. James, Aligs foil and confidant. The movie leads up to the murder of Micahel Melendez, aka Angel, a drug dealer to the ""A-List"" in Club Land. His gruesome murder is glossed over with the bare details. Alig is made a little bit more ""straighter"" in this film by giving him a sexaul relationship with a girl. As if. Based on teh book, Disco Bloodbath. Marilyn Manson makes an appearance as the the transgendered Christina, who was a scarier queen than Marilyn could ever be."
3,Seth Green almost saved this movie,"I love Seth Green's performance, he was great. Compared to the Shockumentary, Culkin's interpretation of Alig was horrible and did no just to the actual Party Monster, Also The guy who played Angel was really good, glad to see him since ""My So Called Life"".I would only recommend watching this only if you really wanted to compare to the real stuff."
2,Meh - not as good as the real story,"I had high expectations for this movie, but it fell short. The A&E biography was more entertaining."
4,"Interesting, disturbed and honest","These were the type of emotions that I had felt watching this movie. I have never was privilaged to view so much drug use in my life, but I was not a club kid. I was facinated to see the life of a club kid protrayed in such an honest way if this is the life it is. I felt very sorry for the people that were involved with each other and thier tattered, addicted lives. I am giving this movie 4 stars for the honesty and the acting of the actors in a way that it was believable."
5,Seth Green steals the show,I think that Culkin was horrible in his role. Seth Green is the man who stole the show. There was just something about the story that makes you want to dig a little deeper. I liked this movie because it was different and was somewhat based on Michael Alig's life.
5,Oh my gawd! It's reaalllly Culkin! too good to be true,5 stars for it's campy qualities. And i love camp. Culkin and Marilyn Manson in the same film? Gotta love it. wooo-hoo!
3,"Great Story, Underdeveloped Characters.",First of all I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. My only gripe with it (and the reason only 3 stars) is the only characters we really get to know are Michael Alig and James St. James. If we knew a little bit more about the other characters this would definetely be a 5-star movie. The acting is incredible and I would recommend this movie.
4,Weird,Video is not for your average viewer. Strong content. The sad part is that it is based on a true story.
3,what a weird movie,wow what a weird movie it was ok but really weird and it shows how the club scence got to where it is today
4,How do you like my UFO?,"I adore this movie. The whole weirdness of it all, plus they have Marilyn Manson as a club kid named Christina and he looks like he has the time of his life in this one. One of my favorite parts is where they have the party in the big truck and Christina is driving it, with a hit of acid on her tongue. The actor who plays Fez on That 70s Show (forgive me...I can't think of his name offhand) also gives an incredible performance, and I'm quite used to him as the character of Fez. Not once did I think ""Fez"" while I watched Party Monster. This isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but if you ever did the late-night raves and partying in your life, you'll feel right at home, even if you don't party like that anymore."
3,You'll get the idea,"A true story, this film presents facts within a most bizarre, theatrical whirlwind. I had never heard this story before watching the film, but I was taken into the fantasy world that one youth made into reality. From the perspective of a deeply involved participant, viewers are taken on the chaotic club ride led by a youth who was on a downward spiral. He remained delusional to the very conclusion, perhaps as confused as any viewer of this film. Amazingly, he collected an enormous following, occupying hundreds of hungry night life addicts. If you found something missing in the news reports, you'll get it after watching this film."
4,"Good Party, Excellent Monster","Top notch performances by McCauley Culkin and Seth Green highlight this expose of the eighties ""club kid"" scene and the infamous Michael Alig.I recommend it for anyone who wants to knew what was really going on during the ""greed decade""."
2,A peek at club kids and the N.Y.C. club called Limelight,"I had a hard time liking this movie, mainly because Michael Alig is such a likable guy and Macaulay Culkin is just so creepy to watch though he does play a gay man remarkably well. Seth Green acts his role but never comes off as comfortable in it and who could blame him. Alig lived life over the top and the movie plays everything over the top. The peek inside the infamous Limelight club is interesting and you'll laugh so hard you'll wet yourself at Marilyn Manson who has a minor role but in the end the documentary that chronicles Alig and the murder of ""Club Kid"" Angel is much much better."
3,One Major problem with this movie.,"THE MUSIC ....is absolutely wrong. Allthogh I am a fan of the latest trend in dance music , 80's throwbacks, and even Electroclash. It would be nice if the music matched the time that the story took place. There is no hint of real late 80's Early 90's club music. I think it makes the story a little unrealistic, and if you didnt know it was based on a true story, you would never guess. The club scene is nothing like how it was then, and it seems like the movie is trying to make it seem like New York night life is still as amazing as it was when Micheal Alig ruled the party scene. You could tell the actors struggled with the characters at the start , but became more convincing as it went on. Its worth watching if you don't know the story, but not as great as I hoped."
2,not as good as the book,"I suggest that you read the book instead. It explains things in detail and gives you a much better picture of the club kids. I was so excited to see the film because I loved the book, but honestly it was a let down. It rushed through everything and did not go into great detail about anything that happened, infact some of the characters mentioned in the book were not even in the film. Good acting, bad story line. However, Party Monster The Shockumentary, now that is something that you need to see."
2,Bad Set Bad Acting,I think if you could get through the bad acting and the bad set then this movie might be ok. I remember watching this movie and in the very beginning saying to myself this is about as low budget as you could possible get. But the bad acting maybe it hard to follow. I guess all you can say is the Home Alone Boy has really grown up!!
1,"Thin, Cheap Production With Neither Moral Nor Meaning","Seth Green and Macaulay Culkin team up to explore the morally and sexually confused NYC night club scene of the early '90s. Shot with a transparent low budget, it's an excruciatingly amateur production: bad lighting, listless performances, crude cinematography and creatively bankrupt screenwriting are just the tips of the iceberg. Neither Green nor Culkin seems particularly involved in their role, with each actor's strange cadence and emotionless delivery giving the constant impression that a cash-strapped director used first takes for every shot. Without a single likeable character to its name, Party Monster chooses to embrace and celebrate a lifestyle so waspy, entitled and superficial that I caught myself actively rooting against the lot of them. Overdrugged, shallow, trivial and irritating, its only use is as a showcase of fantastically absurd costumes and makeup."
1,A letdown,"Being a casual fan of the club-scene and having read the excellent book ""Clubland"" - based on the same story - I had high expectations that this movie was going to take us into the club world and give a real glimpse of what was going on. Unfortunately, the movie is a campy re-telling of a truly horrific story about one Michael Alig. I got the sense that the director was trying to create something that was arty and stylized, where the subject matter really demanded a more down-to-earth and uncolored treatment. Not much point in a movie like this - neither interesting nor fun. I recommend those who want an inside look at the life get a copy of ""Clubland"" instead, which also has more information about the Miami crime scene behind the clubs there as well."
3,Scratched Party Monster,"This movie skips a lot. I wasn't pleased. so Whoever sent this to me, I feel that you have wronged me."
3,A Dark and Raunchy Ride,"Considering this film is based on a true story does confirm that fact is stranger than fiction. Culkin ang Green deliver stellar performances leaving you in awe of the NY party sceen through 3 decades. DJ Keoki, played by Fes (foreign exchange student from That 70's Show) also plays a key role in the film. Having seen him live and hearing about his DJ start and career really hits home with the lavish lifestyles of 24/7 party fiends. Somewhat comparable to Studio 54, this film will leave you in question of how much is too much and where that fine line is crossed from having a good time to doing whatever it takes to be the ultimate Party Monster."
3,The documentary is MUCH better!,"I like this movie-I liked it even more BEFORE I saw Party Monster-Shockumentary. I am a fan of Michael and I write to him. A lot of the events that happened in the movie was twisted because it came from another person's perspective. If you want to real truth, wait until Michael comes out with his book!"
4,A good entry into the drug-fueled club scene films,"Add this one to your movie marathon with Less Than Zero and Bright Lights, Big City. It has that same feel as the earlier films except for the grisly real-life murder that ends the tale. Performances are solid - particularly Green's - and the sets and costume design are great. Chloe Sevigny, of course, is here - I mean she would have to be, wouldn't she? Anyway, it is very entertaining in that falsely glamorous, trashy way. Very good soundtrack."
4,one of my favs!,"Party Monster is one of my all time favorite movies...It's about the life and times of a group of party ""club-kids"" in the late 1980's. It's fun, fabulous, and yes, cheesey and campy! The story has some great twists and turns in it! Watching it you may think it's somewhat of an over exagerated story, but the clincher is, it's based on a true story! How Fabulous is that?All the actors did a wonderful job in taking you back to those club daze (days).. but, Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green and Marilyn Manson, those three kept me glued to the screen.. some really great acting there!"
4,Its an interesting movie...,If you know the story of dear ol Michael then you will enjoy this movie of the Club Kids from NYC. Drug addicted and willing to do ANYthing for a fix.
5,This is a GREAT movie!,"I watched this movie the other night not thinking that it was not going to be that good considering some of the reveiws that I had read. I LOVED IT!!!! The movie was great from the start to the finish. I dont know to much about the real Mike, so I am not sure if the movie follows that story line or not, (I just ordered the shockamentary). I have watched this movie twice already and I sure to watch it several more times. If you are thinking about buying this movie....DO IT!!!!!"
4,"Entertaining, but not entirely accurate","Party Monster is definitely a great movie for entertainment value. MaCaulay Culkin was a good choice to play Michael Alig, but he does exagerate his matterisms a bit (but I guess that's Hollywood). He actually resembles Richie Rich (another club kid), more than he resembles Michael. Seth Green was an interesting choice for James St. James, but he pulled off the role oddly well. Marilyn Manson plays Christina, which is quite hilarious.I keep in touch with Michael Alig the best that I can. He has never seen this movie, so he cannot assess it's validity. If you really want to know the real Michael Alig, watch Party Monster: The Documentary. Still interested in Michael? He's working on an autobiography while he's still locked up.Overall, good movie, I would recommend it, but remember, this is not a documentary, it's just based on a true story."
3,When Sex is Boring,"A ninety four minute Australian-made DVD version probably missed the most explicit moments of generally boring movie of drugs, sex and simply young entrepreneur's meaningless, a film, of which New York City itself is the best acting member."
2,Static sensitive,"I bought two of these and aside from the static problem (turning itself on), I consider it a good product. Would I purchase again? I don't know. I have replaced one battery in the unit thus far."
1,Not rugged enough for dogs...,"I purchased two of the Inova Microlights for my dogs since we walk mostly in the dark. The battery used is easily available at most stores and the light is (when working) quite good. The light has a steady on or a squeeze option to keep the light on temporarily. I really liked it, for about 30 minutes.Dispite the claims of ruggedness, the dogs shaking themselves off after a walk in the rain managed to pop of the covers and lose the batteries after having the lights for one day. With it being dark when I walk them, I am unlikely to find said covers again.There is a ""lifetime"" guarantee for the lights and all I need to do is send Inova another $2 to recieve this fine service. So really you need to figure at least another $2 onto the price if you plan on clipping these lights to a dog harness."
2,"As advertised, but...","I should have paid attention to the fact that this book is comprised of ""period photographs"", all of which are sepia tone or black and white. There is little information about each picture beyond the site name and architect.There is likely a value to this book for an architect or historian, but as my purpose was for inspiration during my remodel, I was disappointed. Many, if not all of the buildings pictured were built at a time when detail and craftsmanship were valued, and while they should be appreciated, it would be far out of my budget to recreate such detail.If you are looking for inspiration, or current pictures (color) of older estates, I would recommend ""California Colonial"" as my first choice. Others to read are ""Red Tile Style"" and ""Casa California: Spanish-Style Houses from Santa Barbara to San Clemente"".""Spanish Revival Architecture"" is a nicely produced book, just not what I had in mind, and I returned my copy to Amazon."
1,Spanish Revival Architecture,"Lots of photos...problem is that they are all in black & white. And, some of the photos seem to be of poor quality or taken many years ago. The beautiful color jacket cover is misleading."
2,"Okay, but not exactly what I was looking for",The previous review of this book expresses my sentiments exactly. I wish I would have read it before purchasing.
3,For Home Use,"This book is good only for very simple arts and crafts. I am a preschool teacher and this book basically does everything that we would do as ""free art"" and nothing more. If that's what you need help with - art for rainy days, for example - this is the book for you. I needed something more substantial."
2,I did not find this helpful in the least.,"It came with 216 ""hot words,"" of which I knew 74 to begin with, and knew them all within a few weeks. I also did a lot of other words in another SAT book, and another book called Word Power. I was getting, in the ""10 Real SATs,"" a 1430 (730 english, 700 math). I then took the real SATs in March, and got only a 1270 (650 verbal, 620 math). Very disappointing, and an embarrasing score. I am still wondering if I didn't do something wrong.."
2,"Not needed to do well, might hinder your preparation.","This book was not exactly the greatest prep book (Barron's is). However, I was able to practice ten tests. Problem was that those practice tests were scaled extremely generously, the SAT's I took were more strict with the scaling. This book is just to gauge your performance and should not be used as a prep book."
3,Not the best,"While the idea of ten real SATs is great, the first few chapters trying to help people improve their scores is a waste. The methods they use are horribly compared to the ones in Princeton Review's books. What it boils down to is this: if you need to improve your score, then get Princeton Review's Math and Verbal Workouts. If, instead, you just want to brush up and get comfortable with the test, then buy this. Take it from someone who has a best combined score of 1410."
5,"Good book, good help","I think that the book was helpful in preparing for the SAT. I plan on taking it again this October, and will see how well it will do in the area of improving my score from my previous attempt. The book uses excellent examples and practice questions that offer explantions about each answer. Two thumbs up on this one"
4,Pretty Good Book,I highly recommend this book. The reason I gave it a four star is because the tips are horrible. The best study guide would be the Barron's 21st edition. I am only 12 doing that talented search stuff. The first time I took the test I got a horrible score. Later my score raised by 320 points because of this and Barron's.
3,10 REAL SATs1,"The Book is a copy of something. Also, the tests are 90's exams which is prior to the 2005 format change at College Board."
5,Must resource!,"This book contains 10 past actual SAT administrations. It is unequivocally a must source for those studying for the SAT; very useful for timed, full-length mock tests to conduct on your own."
5,Got my scores back for Dec and Jan test,"Ten Real SATs helpful in improving my score. The first test I took with no preparation I recieved a 1100 (510v ,590m). I took the test in December and got a 1220 (570v, 650m). In January I recieved a 1270 (610 v, 660 m). That's a 170 point improvement over three tests! My strategy is to take as many tests as you can to become acquainted with the tests. Also, learn a select list of vocabulary words. Princeton Review's list is fairly reliable. I recommend reading articles daily. Acquiring this skill helps on the reading portion.If you're willing to work hard, improving your score will happen. Knock on wood."
4,good book,"this is a very good book. i haven't taken the SAT yet, but my scores jumped 200 points from the first time i took the psat to the second time. there really can't be anything better to prepare with than real tests. I reccomend this book to anyone that is preparing for the test, and it's not that expensive."
4,PSAT Prep Course HS Student,"This book is a brilliant addition to a PSAT/SAT Prep Course! IT contains 10 back-to-back SAT tests! The only problem is, very little of it is review, help, etc. 75% of it is the tests! It's helpful, all right, but I would reccomend that you also get a book that has more review in it, too. The best way to study ffor the SAT/PSAT is 1-2 hours a night at the max."
2,"Filter burst open draining pond, and killed some of my biggest Koi","Length:: 2:10 MinsSo this fishmate pressurized filter burst on me after a few months. Have been using it with a 800 gallon per/hour pump from the beginning. The video shows my dead koi, and after about 1 minute in, you can see the actual busted filter with water streaming out. Heartbreaking. I'm staying from Fishmate products in the future. Sure, Sunterra's are not so innovative, but they wont crack open, drain your pond and kill all your hard bred Koi."
1,Not all in box,Received filter and plumbing pieces were not in the box. Had to go to hardware store to buy parts that were supose to be in the box. Items were listed in the directions.
4,"Haven't had much time to read it, but typical Brautigan","Fast shipping and great condition for age! I've been busy with various things happening at home, but I have read part of it. It's the same zaniness we know from other Brautigan works!"
4,Avant provides us with another winner,"Avant returns with with his fourth CD, Director and while the CD doesn't come close to topping his My Thoughts CD, it does have some decent slow jams which Avant is known for,the CD opens with a the mid tempo track So Many Ways then goes into the blazing slow jam This Is Your Night, followed by the trio of singles You Know What, 4 Minutes and Stick With You all of wich have been radio staples for the past couple of months. Other stand out tracks include the truthful Right Place Wrong Time the sexual Director and the bitter sweet Now You Got Someone. Avant doesn't come close to having the best R&B CD of 2006, no that titles goes to NE-Yo's In My Own Words but he does continue to show promise."
2,This Album Needed A Better Director & Direction,This new installment of his music just let me down. I have been listening to DIRECTOR the past few days since its debut and it still has not made me groove or feel what I expected from Avant. There are only two songs that appeal to me the lead off single 4 Minutes and the Infectious Lie About Us beautifully crafted. However the rest of the album lacks potential and is just plain Jane to me. His best album to date is Ecstacy...now that was hot hot hot right along with the first one. I think this album was rushed because the Private Room was privately a mess and that's putting it lightly. It just doesn't capture me at all...I am a fan of his and it just didn't do it for me. Ofcourse listening to it over and over might change my mind but for now...its garbag'. I like Avant but like the last album this one will probably catch dust and the 2 aforemention songs that I like are the only two that will be frequenting the I-Podage for my listening pleasure.
4,Better than I expected,"I have always enjoyed Avant's music, but had never bought any of his cd's. I was giving a copy of Director by a friend, and it stayed in my cd player for weeks! I knew then I had to purchase the CD. He has great club bangers, a few ballads and a geat socially conscious song. If you purchase this CD you will not be dissapointed! Im surprised I have not heard any more singles from this cd on the radio. He was definitely under the radar this year for Director. Such a shame. :("
4,"Avant, you've won me over.","This cd is a must for any R&B fan. Every track is listenable, and over half of the songs are awesome. The cd loses some steam towards the back end of it, but that's to be expected of an album. I never was a huge fan of Avant, but after hearing 3 songs from this album that i loved (you know what, 4 minutes, and exclusive) I decided to buy the whole thing. I'm very glad I did because its a great cd to pop in when you're driving a long distance. As far as hearing he's comparable to R. Kelly... that's retarded. R. Kelly perfected the Rap&B style, and Avant is a smooth brotha that just likes to sing his heart out."
5,"Great Western Music by Craig Duncan, again!","Another Great CD from Craig and his group. See my previous reviews of his other CD's, ""Legends Of The Old West"" and ""Memories Of The Old West"". This gifted man and his band are incredible, whether he's doing Celtic Music, Old English, Christian Hymns or Classical Music. The instrumental music is very high quality, beautiful, soothing, and extremely and authentically taylored to the music genre and past historical times they are duplicating. I highly recommend any CDs you are able to find by this very musically gifted Artist."
5,comprehensive and easy to understand,This is not the first time I learn about charting for menstrual cycle but it is the first time I understand the chart. It goes beyond the basic and has enough information about how to read the chart that I find it a very useful tool to empower all women to take charge of the health of their reproductive system.
2,Less info than other books,"I purchased this book after reading taking charge of your fertility, and i felt like it was no where near as informative. There is a lot of non-sensical things like writing down made up stories about your ancestors fertility problems... i thought that was kind of odd. Overall there are much better books out there about fertility and cycles."
2,WAY more complicated than it appears,"This software is WAY more complicated that it appears, and takes MUCH longer than you may think.The packaging says""Step One: Insert DVD""""Step Two: Copy on CD-R""""Step Three: Watch Movie""What they didn't say was that you need to follow a tutorial, install 3 additional products (that DO come with DVD Copy Plus)and even with a Pentium 4 computer you're looking at spending about 3 hours per movie shredding the DVD to be downloaded to your computer, changing formats (frame by frame) and then burning your CD.If I had ANY idea that it was like this I wouldn't have bought it."
1,DVD COPY PLUS,Very Confusing software and the Help Files don't match the steps needed to make the product work. I've tried to use this on a number of DVDs and haven't had any success. I have 20+ years experience in DP and I would be ashamed to put my name on a product this Cheesy. I'm sending it back to get a refund. I'm sure the people that gave it 5 stars are employees of the company.
5,Great product. Reliable Service. Supurb Support,I have a copy of this and find it to be simple to use and great for making fast backup copies of movies we've bought and other digital files. It's an easy way to protect the money we've invested in our movies.Great for use in making copies of home movies for the rest of the family. It also came with a bundle of other software which is also very good. Great Job!!! Thanks.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME,"When I got this program, I thought, alright, I now have a way to copy my dvds and video's on to a cd, without buying an expensive dvd burner. I have throw this product away after having it for only a month, and I am now saving to buy a dvd burner.After all the promises made by this product,and by the adds, you would think, that this is the next best think to the computer, being invented. Insturctions read like your putting together the space shuttle, what promises to be a 3 step program, is really 15, some with 2 or more steps. Hours are needed to do this, I did my over night, to get a [unacceptable] picture, and ok sound.STAY AWAY from this product at all cost, save for a dvd burner, or in my case, teach your kids how to take care of your and their stuff."
1,Very poor sound quality,"I can live with the video copy since I understand it is necessary to lose some quality in the process. But, the audio quality is so poor, it makes the copy useless. It has constant skips and stutters.My equipment is fairly new with large hard drives, ample CPU power and more than ample memory. It is definately the copy software and not the hardware.I suggest you spend your money on something else."
1,Dificult to install and cumbersome to run,"The PowerCDR -one of the three pieces of software involved- key was dificult to find. I had to ask customer service for help. Finally I could use the key and open PowerCDR. Although, I cannot run PowerCDR or the other two pieces of software from the tutorial -DVD Copy Pluss- menu.I have to tell that this software is a real mess. It is difficult to install, to use, and there are not enough instructions to follow -or there are not clear or there are contradictory-. I have the impression that this company is very informal and this product is a home produced version of a kid's software. I feel very disappointed and would not recommend this product."
1,I agree: very poor audio quality,"321 Studios should indeed be sued, not by the recording industry, but by end users, for 1) selling what's essentially public-domain technology for profits, and 2) selling software that just doesn't work.I first tried the free download of ""DVD Xcopy Xpress"" on their website but that didn't work with my DVD-R drive, so I bought this. While it burned VCDs and the video quality was ok, the audio part was absolutely terrible. It was choppy, and totally out of sync! The VCDs were simply not watchable, period.So, DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY WRITTEN PROGRAM!"
3,"Good&Bad,Mostly Good","What Seems to be a mountain of a challenge is the tutorial which can fit in a whole Semester of figuring this thing out.But...Once you do figure it out, it's easy.Using SVCD gives you better quality than VCD, but takes more time(about 6hrs.)and more discs.I wouldn't return it, and I wouldn't replace it with a DVD Burner either..I'd just go and buy a 5 disc changer ..."
2,dvd x press,"same company create dvd x press, is easy tu use, till now no other software work that easy, this is the best. with x plus y never can maked work, the x plus work but take to long to copy a disc, but x press is onlu 15 to 20 minutes to copy and another 20 to burn a cd,.. so god luck"
4,Good Resource,"This book is helpful if I have SAP maintenance module. However, it provides insight of SAP module."
2,So so,it was okay. I wish it had more depth to it. It was too much about being prepped to be chosen. I would have more behind the scenes time.
1,Over Rated,"I found this book poorly written and edited in the first few chapters. Also some factual details are wrong. Many sentences were grammatically incorrect. Garrett wavered between Esther living in a small village in the vicinity of Susa and living in Susa itself. Persia is nowhere near the Arabian Peninsula so it is incorrect to say ""under the Arabian sun"".When Esther first arrives at the Harem she eats a meal with chicken and tomatoes! Tomatoes are native to the Americas and were unknown to the Persians. If the author got this wrong how can I trust anything else in the book?Mistakes like these pull me right out of a story and I am unable to continue reading it."
4,Fascinating Details and What-Ifs ...,"The story of Esther is one of my favorites.The time and situation is one that horrifyingly fascinates me...so very fairy tale-like...a beauty pageant is held and the long shot wins the big prize. To increase the tension...she then faces the fear of being found a fake and has to risk even more. Good trumps evil only after a few moments of fingernail chewing. Garrett has fictionalized the Biblical account adding flesh and feeling to what might have happened in the details God didn't provide. Esther's triumph is amazing, but the dark side is that she was taken, rounded up, put in a harem where she was trained and prepared for one night with the king.Garrett's enhanced tale is well written and page turning. Though I knew the end of the story, I didn't want to skip a word. If you love your Biblical fiction to come alive with three dimensional characters you've got to give this novel a shot."
5,A fresh viewpoint,"This book tells the story of Esther and her thrilling rescue of the Jewish people in Persia from a fresh viewpoint thanks to Ginger Garrett's creative approach and striking historical detail. Esther's diary has been uncovered and we follow her journey from a village orphan to queen of an empire through her own eyes as she writes. Written with rich description and palace intrigue, this book isn't one easily set aside - or forgotten."
2,Not what I expected,"It has nice pictures, however, it doesn't give any price guidelines. It would be helpful to have all the manufactures markings in it rather than just a few."
2,Limited usefullness: some factual errors; shows all patterns,"This book is excellent in that it shows all the Franciscan patterns. Beyond that its' usefullness is limited. Superficial discussion of the history of Gladding & McBean and the evolution of the Franciscan line of pottery. Not nearly enough space devoted to the ""art and serving"" pieces. As a price guide it has no value whatsoever."
5,the gold standard,"This text has quickly become the gold standard for both students and practitioners of psychological assessment. It is unique in that it is extremely practical and applicable to day to day practice, yet it is thoroughly grounded in research--which is succinctly cited throughout the text. And, somehow, each volume gets better. This is not a book that will collect dust on a shelf--clinicians will find sage guidance in this text."
4,Assessment,Book arrived promptly in great condition and was very valuable for my education! I will be keeping it for use in my professional career.
1,deficient DVD,Thank you for your inquiry . This DVD was intended as a gift and was not opened right away . The person who unwrapped it in front of me and played it was unpleasantly surprised to realize that DVD was deficient : 5-7 minutes of it was badly damaged . I was ashamed . So my experience with this particular purchase was not pleasant . My friend took DVD with him and forgot to leave it for me to send it back . And I didn't keep the return address (unfortunately ) . I hope that other people who use this seller are not as dissapointed as I was . Thank you for your concern . Alla .
3,Scratches,This is an amazing video however when I recieved it and tried watching it. It skipped at two places. The first part was when Quasimodo was singing about being the pope of fools and the secound was near the end of the song L'attaque de Notre Dame. Upon examining the DVD I found two scratches. I dont know if anyone else had this same issue but I was dissapointed.
5,Why doesn't everyone have this?,"It's been months since I first bought this CD and it's still the one I listen to the most. Anyone reading this should do themselves a favor and pick up a copy. If after a few listens you aren't hooked then I don't know what to tell you. Those of you who have this album and know what I'm talking about should really help to get the word out. Then again, I know the feeling of wanting to keep something good out of the hands of the general masses. Great f'n album."
5,Better and better,"Not only does this album get better with every listen, it actually gets better through the album. Thank You For Me is simply incredible! I once listened to this album for three hours in a row on a late night interstate drive. It kept me both awake and rocking!"
3,"Elvgren is Great, This Book is Not","As an artist and long-time admirer of Gillette Elvgren's illustrations and pinups, I was thrilled to discover this book because until recently, there has been so little published about him. It's interesting to see the photographs he worked from alongside the paintings. It's very annoying, however, that so many of the reference photos are ""flopped"" (turned in the opposite direction from the painting). Why they did this makes no sense, because you can't compare them. Also, the captions are centered rather than justified. The book gives the impression that amateurs put it together. It doesn't do justice to the great illustrations that Elvgren produced."

4,Joe Farrell Takes Flight,"For fans of Joe Farrell's work with the first version of Chick Corea's Return to Forever band and Elvin Jones' trio work on Blue Note, this is a real treat. The album finds Farrell at the peak of his powers during his tenure with CTI records. Although CTI did a lot of big productions, this is a quartet album recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey in 1972. The rhythm section is made up of Herbie Hancock on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums. Fans of Miles Davis' early electric work ( such as ""Miles in the Sky"" or ""Filles de Kilimanjaro"") will enjoy this, as will anyone who enjoys fusion in its early experimental phase when funky backbeats were evenly mixed with Coltranesque modal patterns."
5,"May be ""oldies"" by now, but they're still goodies...","This compilation is a clear sign that Moonshine had a good thing going at one time. Fierce diva vocals and hard riffs abound. Still sounds fresh today and along with volume 2, is a great way to collect some of Moonshine's best. Track times:1. my love (5:33)2. everybody listen (4:52)3. so in love (6:46)4. caterpillar (6:24)5. superstar DJ (5:03)6. stop (7:49)7. caterpillar (5:02)8. Lift me (7:13)9. go (6:03)10. paradise (6:19)11. starts living (7:11)"
3,Entirely Dispensable,"Billed as ""essential"" in its subtitle, I found this book to be nothing of the sort: Competent? Yes. Helpul? Marginally? Essential? No way.""MBA's Guide to Microsoft Excel 2000"" roams little farther than Excel's built-in help screens. Despite its billing, this guide adds nothing that would help an MBA (or anyone else, for that matter) with constructing more effective financial statements or do complex valuations. There is simply nothing here for the advanced student.Some users may find it useful to have basic instructions compiled in a single printed volume. I do not. If you are seeking a basic book on Excel, I suspect that this one will not disappoint you. If, on the other hand, you are seeking to improve on a passing familiarity with Excel then I recommend that you continue looking."
2,"Good for the undergraduate student maybe, but not the MBA","This is a competent, basic introduction to using Microsoft Excel in business and finance; however, its title is misleading in that the MBA student's needs in using Excel in 500-level Finance and Business classes are well beyond the scope of this book. The book is good to have on hand for a quick description of a function, but it adds little more than the F1 Help key does."
2,outdated,Book is not very easy to use and is outdated. Bought it to prep for an MBA program. Would not recommend.
2,Disappointed,"This book didn't seem to offer me anything that I didn't already get out of something like ""Using Excel 2000"". If you aren't an extensive user of Excel for financial modeling this might be helpful but it is of little value to the more experienced user and those who have done any amount of financial modeling."
4,"Works well, but power questions",The card was easy to install and works well for my needs of running a flight simulator. There was one potential problem. Although nowhere to be seen in the copy on Amazon the box states that it needs a minimum 300 watt power supply while my HP PC had only 20W. So it would have been nice to know this up front. However a knowledgeable person on an HPsupport forum assured me that the GeForce 6200 actually drew little power and would be fine. It has been installed for a couple of weeks now and all is OK.
4,almost a 5,"for those of us still dealing with agp connectors this is one of the few available boards that will support the newer EA games that my grandkids are addicted to. The missing star reflects the fact that the package is basically an OEM configuration with no documentation. I'm a bit smarter than the average bear with this stuff, so finding what comfort I needed on the web site was OK. A less experienced (or aware) user might have problems. Other than that gripe the install was clean and the board performs to expectations."
4,Bought for an older computer,I was updating an older computer for my niece and the graphics card that was in there was shot so I updated it with this GeForce and I was pleasantly surprised at the graphics.
4,Video card a good buy,Got this card to increase the capabilities of my computer system--and it worked very well indeed.
4,works great,So far so good.I have had it for a few weeks now .I am not a gamer but I can say video seems to work alot better and the colors are much more vibrant.Well worth the upgrade for the price and the delivery was fast.
2,"Not our problem, contact computer manufacture","I purchased this video card to replace the one that came installed in my Sony VAIO descktop computer. I had no problem installing the hardware, or the software, the video card is a good value. But the computer now locks up when awakening from Standby. The e-mail based customer support is one shot; you ask a question, they answer(a day or so later) you can ask another question, they answer. For my problem, the answer was; either Microsoft screensaver or the Sony computer caused the problem. That funny because the only change I had made was the video card."
3,Working well for me,I bought this to replace an old ATI all-in-wonder 64MB card. It's working well and colours are looking much better from my projector. No problems setting up or using - good value imho
1,Lost in Transit,"Yeah, well I can't really rate the product because it never arrived. Amazon sent the video card using USPS and guess what, after 10 days of having the ""In-Transit"" status after arriving to the USPS office (which it is 25 minutes away from the destination) I had to call Amazon, and they basically told me ""Yeah, hmmm...we are sorry your package is lost"". They said they could send me a replacement but that it would take more than one week to arrive. I asked for a full refund. I was lucky enought to get the refund within 10 business days. Amazon shouldn't use USPS for this type of orders. And how come the package was parked at the USPS office for almost two weeks without Amazon noticing something was wrong !!!!"
5,Stylish and Functional,"The eel Skin Checkbook Cover is very durable, love the color and it is functional because it has room for my drivers licence and credit cards. I would recommend it also."
5,checkbook cover,"this was really a great present for my husband, he always carries his drivers licence, etc in his checkbook, the card holder is perfect for that."
1,Beware!! Its not what the picture looks like!,"I was expecting it to be like what it is in the picture; with card holder but it is not. It is just a simple checkbook cover. If you are looking for a checkbook with card holders, this is not it. Look somewhere else.I have contacted the seller about it and still waiting for their reply. I'll update my review on how seller act on this one."
2,Disappointed...,"Sadly, this product doesn't seem to have any big effect on our rambunctious Lab. Oh well, we tried."
4,great follow-up read,"this was a great follow-up to crossfire - again, i read this a number of years ago but it sits on my shelf as one i will definitely go back to! as always with sequels i'd love for stories to continue but felt happy with this ending anyway. looking forward to reading more of jeanette's books on my kindle."
5,great,"this is a great cellphone, even though i am still learning how to use it (the owners manual is written in spanish), i only wish that i had a english manual. otherwise, this is a very good cellphone."
5,"An deftly written, engrossing, armchair tour of the world","Tom Canby had the great good fortune of working for the National Geographic during that wonderful time when all the big glossy magazines and high-circulation newspapers were willing to spend money to bring information to their readers. This willingness to to be serious about news coverage gave this deft and sensitive writer the chance to roam the world and take the time necessary to cover his beat (science) in depth and with a thoroughness almost unheard of today, when even great institutions like National Geographic are nickel-and-diming to cut costs. From Botswana to the Bering Sea is the personal memoir of a gentle man and a gentleman. Canby would probably be the first to admit (as he, in fact, alludes in his book) that he is not the stereotype of the hardbitten tabloid news reporter. Instead he is an essayist of uncommon grace. This is a wonderful book."
4,Wonderful Reading,"This is not a review but an urgent request to find the most recent book published by Thomas Y. Canby, Sandy Spring Legacy. This is the legacy of a Quaker Village and tells the story of one of the oldest towns in the Maryland Piedmont, settled by the Quakers and others in the early 1700's. I am interested in finding this book as I once lived in this little Quaker Village forty years ago. Thank you for any leads you may have."
3,"Didn't fit, pain in the butt","I will give this 3 stars out of the possibility that somehow I was too stupid to get the fit right, but I have an average size ferret and we were absolutely unable to get this thigh enough that he couldn't slip right out of it."
5,Great starter exercise video!,"I used this tape for years before moving on to more advanced tapes. The choreography is kind of old-fashioned, but remains fun. It's only 20 minutes long and easy to learn. The instructor is cute and upbeat without being cloying. I still return to it occasionally on low-energy days. Since it's low-impact, there are no worries about overdoing it. Definitely recommended."
4,EBC Brakes DP21254 Greenstuff 2000 Series Sport Brake Pad review,good solid performer. more brake dust than oem honda brakes. important to remember to seat the brakes as noted by manufacture.
2,Does not work,This product does not work as advertised. I tried several applications but still had to sand the surface to get the rust off. Save your money and buy sandpaper.
3,OK,"I used this on some scraper blades and it did work. I also used a different product, with seemingly the same results. This stuff was nasty, with a very strong chemical odor. It seemed to be stronger than what I required."
3,Iolitesun,Okay movie and should be a big hit with smirnov ice fans. My three year old LOVES the theme song and is especially impressed with both Croger the 100' tall guy and Tori Spelling's unibrow so we're going to order a copy for him.
1,6 Billion Heads,"This movie was made to be a 1 star movie. I like some things from it like the fact everyone had to be decapitated not just killed, and the kid who helps the aliens with their conquest. When it comes down to it I think it's one of those movies worth seeing once or twice."
2,Required for class,"I was forced to buy this for an Eng lit grad course. I can't say much about about it because I haven't returned to it since then, but most of the info is commonsense if you have done advanced research; however, if you haven't there might be some helpful tips but I have found experience is the best teacher in that respect."
2,Factory review,"the drill will not lock into the drill function, therefore when I drill something it slips when the drilling pressure increases. bought it for an addition i was building on to my summer house. will persue sending itback at a later date. should have bought a new one."
4,adorable,"This is the story of a little old lady with a big heart who takes in every stray animal that comes to her doorstep. THe problem is that she doesn't have any money to feed them and she is almost out of food when a stray lion comes to her doorstep. She takes him in, bathes him, feeds him her last few morsels of food. Then, the police and zookeeper come looking for the lion and find that the old lady has quite a talent for taming and caring for animals so they give her a job with the zoo animals. It's a very cute story and I love the illustrations. The little old lady is fragile looking, but very assertive and kind at the same time. CUTE!!"
2,too big,"I have several pairs of KC shoes, two from this same line. But this one is huge!!! I think it must be a mistake. I was very dissapointed in the sizing discrepancy. I do like this line though, I love the scalloping around the edges and they are comfy. Too bad these ones have to go back."
3,"nice, comfortable shoe, but not at all like picture","I ordered this loafer in clover and was very surprised by how little it resembles the image on the site. Online it appears to be two-tone, with pink suede around the sides and red leather on top. In reality it is all the same dark, dusty rose-like color with the only difference being the matte suede and the shine of the leather. The shoes are much more conventional than the funky cuteness I thought I was getting, but they are still quite nice and comfortable (KC Reaction shoes run a half size large for me, so instead of an 8 1/2 I order an 8) and perfect for work so I plan to keep them."
5,SUPER COMFORTABLE,These are honestly the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. Perfect for work and play.
3,Am I a leperchaun?,These shoes make me feel like a leperchaun. Best worn with pants so you don't notice the oddly squared toe so much. Great for St. Patrick's Day! If you love a good square toe I give them 5 stars for comfort!!!!
4,"Loafers, too big for their shoes","The shoes were very good quality but the sizing runs big. I ordered a size 6, which every other pair of shoes I own are, and the Kenneth Cole Loafers were a good whole size too big. A friend tried them on and they fitted her. She wears a size 7. I had to return them and lose money on the deal. Too bad. They looked nice and comfortable."
4,nice,"im sure this works fine, i just have not needed it, even once, dont know why i bought it, havent used it once."
2,A curious album,"Of all the albums from Vangelis that I have, Invisible Connections is one of his most unusual. Invisible Connections was released in 1985. Three compositions are contained: ""Invisible Connections,"" ""Atom Blaster,"" and ""Thermo Vision."" This is atypical music--perhaps minimalism. Even though I find Invisible Connections to be listenable and interesting, I do not consider it to be enjoyable. The disc is almost forty minutes. I am glad that I acquired Invisible Connections, though--it is a curio that has merit--but I recommend it only to completists."
2,Letters are too small,"Really disappointed! The letters are too small for my 3 years old to play. Thought they are bigger from descriptions, pictures."
4,Handsome economical Bible,"For a personal Bible at reasonable cost, this is a standout. Print is small in order to make this a complete Bible. The book probably would not hold up to constant use, but is fine for a bedside Bible. One more thing: Aesthetics suggest this as a Bible for a woman or a girl. It looks feminine. That may sound peculiar, but take a look at the picture."
5,Great Purchase,We ordered these Bibles to have on hand at church to give out as gifts and for children who don't have a Bible. They are light-weight and paperback and relatively inexpensive. I have ordered them twice now.
5,Nice Edition,"This is a nice edition of the Good Book. The contemporary cover design makes it look more attractive for many folks who feel put of by more traditional designs. After all it should be the contents that matter. Having a paperback edition that is nicely made is great, also as a gift.Another book I can recommend isThe Life of Apollonius of Tyana."
5,Plain and Simple Word of God.,"I was given a copy of the NIV Witness Edition Bible as a college freshman, because I had no Bible to call my own. I was philosophically and spiritually unsure, and generally felt just a vague connection to Christianity through my Catholic roots.It was this book that slowly, painstakingly brought me to God. It wasn't an overnight boom, you're there conversion...more of a slow turning upward, a gradual creation of light. Since I became immersed in the issue of Bible translations, I've grown to love other Bibles (especially the NKJV), but my NIV Witness Edition Bible, with its beat-up paperback cover, remains a very special one to me. If you wish to get a gift for somebody in need of spiritual uplifting, the Bible may be just the thing...I submit that this humble paperback, solid in its dimensions and with almost no embellishment on the Scripture inside, is a thing that just might change somebody else's life."
3,"Passable, but Barely","This edition also could be called the cheapskate's Bible. I spent a lot of time with this book and developed a certain emotional attachment, but from an objective perspective, it is not even close to the best version to buy. The footnotes are virtually nonexistent and when things are footed it is generally of very little assistence. The NIV of course has a bit of a bias toward mainline Protestant Christianity since they are the ones who produced this translation. There are no introductions to the varioius books, either. The ""helpful"" articles are little more than standard propagandistic fare. For the best bet, check out the Oxford Revised English Bible instead. It has great notes that actually give some insight into Biblical thought. The only reason I own this Bible is because it was given to me for free, and though I admit that owning this Bible is better than owning no Bible at all, it's not much better."
5,NIV Zondervan Bible Makes Student's Study Easier,"This Bible is clear, concise and easy for students to understand. Makes a great study guide for mature Christians as well. Takes reader through history during Biblical times with maps and commentary. My niece is taking religious courses in college and is most thankful for this user-friendly Bible. It has a table of weights and measures, even how to read the Bible. Also has topics on fear, worship, etc. so the reader understands or comes into a greater appreciation for the written Word and how it's applicable for daily living today."
3,In Response to Kevin_S,"I share most of your thoughts on religion, appreciate your perspective, and have just two points for you:1) Your comments are belittled their own ""grandiloquence""2) A quote: It is conceivable that religion may be morally useful without being intellectually sustainable. -- John Stuart MillPerhaps you should spend your time examining your own happiness rather than decrying the means by which others derive theirs?"
5,Amazing Show,"It deserves 6 stars and I hope they make a new season. If you like this show, you will also like True Heroes and Man vs Wild."
5,Just as advertised. Excellent,This program really gets your attention. Worth the price. Supplier excellent as well.
5,Excellent!!,"This show is engaging, intelligent, uplifting, inspiring, spiritual, hopeful, incredible in the area of cinematography and special effects, and most importantly, helps one appreciate what he or she has in life."
3,Watch stupid people doing stupid things.,"I didn't know whether to laugh or hold my breath when I watched disc 1 of this series. I hate stupidity, and that is what this series is about: studpid people getting themselves into stupid situations by thier stupid decisions and blaming someone else. If you like to watch stupid people doing stupid things, then you'll enjoy this show.Sorry, but I can't watch stupid people. these shows are a perfect example of natural selection. When your number is up, your number is up. The shows are well made with actors portraying the victims. Watch people at their worst. In disc 1 you can watch three adventure seeking young men follow a macho guide to an adventure only two of them return from.in the Amazon. I won't say anymore in case you want to see it. I don't want to spoil it for you."
1,Don't waste your money,"Be careful--if you want a makeover product, don't buy the sampler. There is almost nothing you can do with it. You need the full version to have any fun or get any hair/makeover ideas. The 'sampler' is just code for demo-disk, and should be free."
2,So so,Bought Purolator L25545 Classic Oil Filter for my VW Touareg. Filter removed after 3500 miles had started to crack at the pastic ends. Wont be buying these for a while.
2,Statistics a Pre-Requisite,"As a graduate student with no formal training in statistics, the authors jump head-long into discussions of educational statistics beyond the pervue of the course for which this book was intended. Some good descriptions, but other texts are more appropriate."
5,An excellent text,"I have used this book for three years to instruct individuals in a masters degree program. The book is clear, easy to read, and easy to understand - quite a feat for a book about research and statistics! Most educators are intimidated by texts on educational research, but this book is readable and makes sense!"
4,Educational Research Textbook,Inside pages were in great shape. The outside of the book was bent and worn. Overall this product is okay.
4,My Purchase through Amazon from Rebecca Moore,"The item - 'Introduction to Educational Research' wasn't brand new as the seller said, it was just ok, for the purpose it was intended to serve. The seller REBECCA MOORE, however played some trick on me.She sent me a used-code to register on Research Navigator.I had e-mailed her about the used 'code'After about three or so e-mail exchanges. Ms Moore asked for my 'students' information so she could purchase a code for me to use. But how could I TRUST Ms Moore with my students' infomation if she wasn't truthful aboout the code she had sent me earlier on?I would forever AVOID this name any time I see it on Amazon, I do not remember reading other negative infomation about her before I bought from her. I thought that was enough for her to adjust"
3,The Best Of Maynard Ferguson (1980),This is a standard compilation of Ferguson's hit songs of the 70's. I can's believe that the CD is $59.00 when you can get the original LP at a garage sale for about $1.00!!!!!
2,Sorry-didn't like it,I wanted to like it. I give it 2 stars instead of one because it was interesting reading about the period. However the writing was not of a high level. I checked a couple of times to see it is considered a young adult book. Some of the sections are simply boring such as the pages long section when the protagonist is stalking a deer.
2,title is deceiving,"Looking for insight into the ""future"" of advertising, I decided to read this book. Makes sense given the title. Much of the book, ironically, is dedicated to the history of advertising. It gives little indication where things are headed other than they are changing. If you're not in marketing or advertising, maybe it's fresh and interesting. For those in this business, 95% of this book is ""yeah, now tell me something I don't know."""
2,Monumental mediocrity,"He talks about everything except the future. Somewhere in the end he even says something like ""future is uncertain and reliable maps are far and few in between"" I thought his book wanted to answer this question?!Monumental mediocrity. Fancy title."
3,Color,"I bought this as a present and it seems nice enough but one of the main reasons I bought this one specifically is because I liked the dark navy color. Unfortunately it's a little misrepresented, the actual dark navy checkbook cover is just about black. I probably would've ordered another color if I had known."
4,Nice skin,"beautiful checkbook, nice eel skin. Good color. It is slightly oversize which is so nice because I don't have to fight to get my checkbook in. It has an extra pocket inside which is nice."
4,Looking good,"Cover looks good. I have had eel skin products in the past, and expect this to last for years."
4,Beautiful and well-made,"The eelskin leather has a wonderful appearance: richly textured and elegant. The cover is well-made and seems quite durable (after several months' use, mine still looks new). As the previous reviewer mentioned, the cover does have a tendency to gape open slightly when a full book of checks is inserted, but I've found this problem lessens with time. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the product. I do wish it came with a clear plastic tab to hold the upper page of my check register open (as my old cheapo plastic cover did), but that's a minor quibble."
2,It looks nice... until you try to put your checks inside,"This checkbook looks great! Pretty color, nice material...However, when I put my checkbook inside, the cover will not stay closed! The pocket is too deep and the spine of the checkbook holds the cover open at a 45 degree angle- it's annoying! There was a pen pocket in the middle that I thought might be contributing to it staying open, so I removed it. It didn't make a difference.Disappointing :("
2,Pen holder is useless,"Will not accept a thin pen and close properly.They need to add an additional 1/2 inch betweenthe ""flaps"" to allow for the space of a pen.I will have to keep using my old cover.Looks great but disappointed."
1,One good song.,"I bought this because I loved the song, ""Gloria"". The rest of the CD is so blah! A waste of money."
2,Too dark... not what I expected,"These targets are almost impossible to see outside of 10 yards at two of my local ranges. Why? Because the rear walls of most indoor ranges are made of dark material. When you shoot a hole into one of these targets, you can not see anything as the background is also dark. In other words, a dark hole in a dark target=invisible. They looked cool and functional in the picture and were relatively inexpensive. I will be more thoughtful next time and not go for the least expensive option."
5,Great Book,"Our 2 year old granddaughter loved this story book. She sat next to us on the couch in her pink tutu as Grandma & Grandpa took turns reading her the story over, and over and over again."
