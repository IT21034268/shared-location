2,The on & off switch broke in less then 6 months!,"My first water-pik lasted for a close to 3 years. I ordered second one in February, and noticed they changed the water-pik. I am wondering if this change was a problem.?? I had the second water-pik less then 4 months! Will research other water-piks."
2,Quit Working in Less than a Year,This product didn't last a year before it completely quit working. Don't waste your money. I can hear it running but nothing comes out. There isn't any way to clean it out. I won't buy another one.
4,rating,This is much better than the old one I had. This is much easier to use and does not take up much room. The old tank style one took up too much room.
1,Worked for two weeks,I'd never used a water flosser before and was skeptical but after several tests I concluded that it did a better job than traditional flossing. The big problems is that first the water resevoir lid broke off (not aa big problem) but then the motor stopped running. I'm going to look for a different brand.
1,Satisfied...,The waterpik flosser is a great asset in keeping gums and teeth in great condition. This item was recommended for maintaining good dental health.Response and mailing were also quite prompt. Thanks for this item.Dee Phillips
1,"Poorly Designed, Low Quality",Very disappointed. Battery dies quickly. The product design is so poor that it's difficult to hold it while cleaning teeth and your fingers start to feel numb within minutes. The worst part - the product stopped working within 6 months. Don't waste your money.
3,Runs out of juice too fast.,"Need to do 3 fill ups per cleaning, and shooting the bottom back side of teeth is tricky. Only pro is that I can go in the shower and blast away with out spraying everything in the bathroom"
1,a big disappointment,"I bought this product upon the recommendation of my dental professional. The first unit lasted about a year. The second unit lasted maybe 6 months. It needed to be recharged often, and then finally would not charge at all. My next purchase will be from a different manufacturer. Unfortunately, I did not have the receipt for either unit, so could not get a replacement, but maybe that's a good thing in the long run - less frustration."
1,Customer Service,"I ordered the cordless Waterpik, it arrived in record time, but it only held a charge for a week and then quit altogether. I called Waterpik and they immediately sent me another one, but that wouldn't pump the water, so I called again and decided to get the electric model. It arrived in record time and I love it. It's much easier to handle, the reservoir holds more than enough water, but to my mind, the biggest thing is the customer service at Waterpik. Each person I talked to was friendly, and very, very helpful. I don't know when I've been treated so nicely."
1,Fault Design?,I bought this for my daughter who has braces. It died within six months. I bought another one and it quited working after a few months of use too. It seemed that water somehow can get into the motor compartment and caused the damage.I bought a Panasonic model for her and it is still working fine for 12 months so far.
1,water pik,Never worked right - didn't have enough pressure and after a while it wouldn't charge. Waste of money.
4,Portable. Convenient with good price,"It works great, I managed to make it work for me filling the tank only once through forcing the water pressure against my gum . The only con that I see is that it does not have any power indicator that tells you if it is fully charged."
1,"Looks Good, but is Poorly Designed","After a few months the metal plug for charging the battery, which inevitably gets wet, begins to corrode and you can't charge it any more."
1,Waste of money,Threw mine in the pail. You could get as much water pressure by just swishing your mouth out with warm water. What a piece of junk.
3,Good but not great,"I've enjoyed and benefitted from Water Piks for about 25 years. The older, clunkier models were often much longer lasting, and although heavy and bulky, they outperformed the more recent ones. Maybe the recent ones are made in China; i don't know that.This traveling unit is sleek, modern, clever, but not powerful enough for my taste. And one of the 3 I bought had a fault in the charger and so I'm returning it as I write this.The price is a plus, so you can buy more than one and use it as a base unit as well as a traveling unit."
1,Not Good,"I have used a counter standing Waterpik for a number of years and thought this would be a great thing having a smaller, more portable version. What a waste of money. If you do the recommended 5 secs per tooth, you can only do about 3 teeth before you have to shut it off and open it up and refill it again. Can't get the tip to stop twirling either. Yuk. Back to the countertop version..."
1,waterpik rechargeable system,The water pressure is poor and the reservoir doesnot hold enough water- it had to be refilled twice every time I used it. After a few months it quit working.
2,Trying the more expensive model,"Now this thing worked famously for about a week. After that I can't tell if the motor is freezing-up, or the battery is going out. I was really hopeing to defy the odds and have this model work for me but alas I am not the chosen one. Returned to the store and bought the upgrade. I see that this new model is as loud as a leaf blower with a bad cylinder, and has more leaks than a water hose after it was run over by a lawn mower. we'll see if I have luck. If not I will be forced to buy the Panasonic. Funny how these oral irrigators become ""must have"" after a few days. It still hurts my gums like heck. Hopefully this is a result of it working. Anyway wish me luck!!!"
1,A waste of money.,"Last year, my dentist told me to buy a Water-Pik. This model seemed to be the best buy. I've had a problem with charges not lasting long, but now, the power button has to be pressed repeatedly before it works, then it has to be held, as it will no longer stay on without being held. It is very hard to use this way. I can't send it back, as I can't find the slip. I can't really afford to buy another one, but I can't afford to lose my teeth, either. I hope to find a better model."
1,I give up,"This is the 3rd time I have bought the handheld cordless WaterPik. I love it when it works. It really helps, my periodontist has really noticed a difference. The 1st one lasted about 6 months or so, the 2nd about 3 months, and this last one I bought July 6th and here it is Sept 12, and it's ready for the trash bin. Works great when you first get it, but after the first charge wears down, it just gets weaker and weaker until it dies completely. I have followed the charging instructions to the tee, and it still died.... I really need this product, but it looks like I will have to try something else."
2,My long-term testing results: good idea but poor reliability,"The Water Pik WP-360 is a great product concept and I enjoyed using it regularly, especially in the shower. Pressure (using the expert tip) is good while the unit is new and the batteries are fresh. Unfortunately after owning four of these over two years, I can say with authority this product is simply not built to withstand more than a few months of regular use regardless of how well it is cared for. If WP addressed the issues of poor battery characteristics and unacceptable reliability, this product would be a winner. Instead, I recommend the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator which is not rechargeable (uses AA batteries), has a smaller tank, and does not create as much pressure. However, it is well made and travels better since it is collapsible and does not need a charger."
2,Batteries last 6 months,"I used this twice a day. Worked great for 4 months. Then over the next 3 months the battery charge lasted less and less time. Now it is totally dead. Great design, poor battery quality. I will not be buying another to replace it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This item does not work as described. It did not clean my teeth, the well has to be refilled several times for one cleaning and the water goes all over the sink and makes a mess. Don't waste your money!"
1,Lousy product good concept,"This is a great design (portable, rechargeable, etc..) however after owning two of them I could not recommend them to anyone, the last one only lasted a month using it once a day. The first few times you use it there is plenty of power after that you might as well use a garden hose, it would work better. Buy something different such as an oral breeze and don't waste your money on this item."
2,Cordless Waterpik Disappoints!,"I've owned this product for nearly six months. The manufacturer claims the battery should last a week, but for the last month or so I've had to charge it before each use. Even with that, the flow of water poops out before I finish. In addition to the weak battery, the tip release, on and off buttons are very close to each other, making it likely that you'll have unexpected results when trying to push the appropriate one. More than once I've had water squirting around the bathroom because of the design. On the plus side, it is astonishing how much gunk the product removes, even after brushing. My advice... the idea is great, but get one that plugs in!"
2,Disappointing,"While the title of this book is impressive and promisesinformation on working with grieving children, the book itself onlypresents a very superficial view of the process of working withcomplicated grief in children. The author speaks with great compassionand obviously has experience in the area of bereavement, but largetypeface and use of photographs of children predominate the text--- Iwould have preferred more information and less drama, more of theauthor's expertise and advice in lieu of photos. Yes, creativeactivities are mentioned, but no real depth or rationale is providedfor their use in grief work..."
5,Great cd!,Tracks...1. Black Hole2. Pull Me3. Tuchi4. Lost You Lost Me5. Will Not Baby6. You Found Out7. Looking In The Sky8. Should I Be Clueless9. Stand By The Door
3,Missing images?,"I downloaded the kindle sample, and what I read sounds like it would be very interesting and helpful to improve building techniques. I would like to have the kindle version of this book because it would be very easy to use while building - however the sample had missing images on two separate devices.For this type of book, that's pretty much a deal breaker.The book looks great though, so I will be buying it - just not as kindle."
3,Not for younger children,"Bought this for my 9 year old who loves legos and coming up with his own amazing designs. Thought this book would be helpful for him to learn more about the different bricks and their uses. However, it is too much text book for him and he is not interested in it at all. I did also buy the Lego Ideas Book and he loves looking at the pictures in that one and getting new ideas."
2,Too technical,I purchased this for my 9 year old grandson and it was too wordy and technical. The other book I book was much better suited for him.
3,Scalable Ideas,"I found this book valuable in the chapters that presented how to plan out lego designs in terms of color, proportions and scale. Perhaps my expectations were way too high when I ordered this book, cause I was a little let down, but I still found it interesting. Some of the chapters were informative but just shared info that a little research on the lego website would offer. The author did put a lot of effort into this book -- there are some fun little projects (train station and space shuttle that should be fun to build if I have enough legos). It's just that I was expecting the book to be Disneyland and it wasn't. But for the price I bought it I can't complain."
3,We are Lego maniacs,"My kids are young enough that the basic building schemes illustrated here are interesting to them. Some are beyond them (ages 5,6,11). They were somewhat disappointed there weren't more ""models"" or building plans to follow. I like it, though, because it just shows the basics then makes them use their imaginations where anything is possible. So, it's useful, but not an item I'd rave about."
3,Not for younger kids,Bought this for my 10 year old - not exactly what I expected. Too complicated - intended for much older readers? Has alot of useful information but not kid friendly.
3,too old for an 8 year old,"This book was well written and informative. However, the reading level was far above an 8 year old. But he can grow into it."
5,THIS IS VERY HELPFUL,This book is very good. Great!!! it goes to the tiniest detail. it helps build lots of things. I RECAMD THIS BOOK!!
2,No Color Photos,"While this book does have a lot of information on the various Lego bricks and pieces, it does not offer much in the way of actual structural examples. There are very few pictures and none of them are in color. This book is more about explaining the different Lego parts and their potential uses. My 7 and 9 year old have shown very little interest in this book which I would say is mistitled."
2,Dull dull dull,"I'm a big lego fan, but this is really not a good book. Not very good building ideas and just not very interesting."
1,Not what we expected,My husband and I reviewed this book and found it too technical. He is an aeronautical engineer and able to fix or build nearly anything. Our sons are Lego fanatics and I bought this book with the hope of it being a jumping off point for them and my husband.The reviews I read prior to purchase led me to believe that it would be a good book for our Lego builders.I wish there was something else in between besides Lego contraptions (by Klutz) and this book.
2,A great comprehensive guide to all things LEGO,"This is a great comprehensive guide to all things LEGO. My son will receive hours of enjoyment, I am sure. It is a shame that the illustrations are in black and white. For such a colorful subject it is disappointing but for the number of illustrations color would have proven expensive."
5,Lego Builder's Guide,Our 9yr old grandson is a Lego fanatic and has previously mastered the directions to other lego items. Then he doesn't know what to build. He got this book and is now creating new items. His mom says he is thrilled with the book. Thanks.
2,Lego Builder's Guide,I should have listened to the other raters. I thought my 10 yr old son would be able to find plans to build some lego things so I wouldn't have to buy so many kits. I did find the accompanying website info helpful. The book was just too technical for a child.
5,THIS BOOK IS AWESOMEBy Hickerysmoke,This book is the best lego book i have ever read and it is awesome a good book for all ages great ideas brilliant pics and it is written amazingly.This is the end of a review for an awesome book!!!!!!!!
5,AWESOME BOOK!!!,"I just finished this book on Kindle. I thought I knew a lot about building with lego, but this book changed my opinion dramiticly! I learned lots of interesting tecniques, like macro scale, micro scale, & miniland scale. I give this a 5 star rating! This book hyped me up about lego building, and I hope it does the same for you!Heartily recommend it!legofan1 out!"
4,Both a how-to and a reference,"This is a really interesting book. It's a best practices guide for Lego. It teaches how to plan and sculpt Lego like nothing I have read before. It's definitely not the type of book that you get with a Lego kit.There is also a reference section at the end of the book which covers all of the different types of Lego pieces, which is really handy.My reservation is that the book could have been larger. The author could have presented more examples to illustrate different types of Lego techniques. So if anything my four star rating is just my way of saying; more, more!"
5,Grandparents' Helper!,"There are not many toys at Grandma and Grandpa's for our grandchildren to play with so when we came across a LEGO set that used to belong to our son we hoped that it would be a good way for the grandchildren to develop their creative skills. However, we are definitely what you would call ""LEGO illiterate"". We didn't know where to begin until someone recommended Allan Bedford's book, `The Unofficial LEGO Builder's Guide'. We purchased it last fall and now look, at least to our grandchildren, like we know all there is to know about LEGO. The Brickopedia is especially helpful and although our projects will be small for awhile with the help of this well written and well organized book we will move on to bigger and better things in the future. LEGO is a great way to spend quality time with grandchildren and can become addictive thanks to the help found in Allan's book."
4,Adorable,This little monkey is just adorable. He is soft and cuddly. He has just the right amout of stuffing to make him fun to hold and to play with. He is a decent size meaning he's not too big or to little for my 5 year old. I would recommend this product.
3,mambo doesn't compare to an ipad....,"the monkey just sits there, and stares at me with eyes filled with contempt and hatred. he silently lectures me from the dresser he is currently perched on. The banana in his hand only serves as a reminder of how much failure i've endured, and yet i still can't remove him from my life. I find myself wondering why.why do i hold onto an inanimate monkey that only brings me pain and misery? maybe one day i will find a reason, who knows maybe it's to avoid inevitable loneliness...all im trying to say is that this monkey doesn't compare to an ipad. he doesn't get wifi, and doesn't crack when you drop him in the kitchen..."
2,Amazing!,I bought this item direct from Perry about three years ago. The plastic belt clip is a good idea but not good enough. Those times it is necesary to unbuckle your belt the clips drop from the belt. I've tried these with several widths and thicknesses of belts and the problem persists with each. Rather than throw way $20.00 I eventually removed the platic Perry clips and installed standar metal clips (wich work much better even when clipped to a belt) Perry uses an over agressive email advertising program that begins before they ship your merchandise. A third negative is that this same belt sells on the Perry website for $20.95.
5,Monopoly Pricing,"This device does what it should, but like printer cartridges is way over priced because there is no competition."
3,Badly Described,"I gave only 3 stars not for the water filter itself (I'm sure it works fine on the right machine), but because the description of this item said it would fit my Jura espresso machine...AND IT DOESN'T! I carefully reviewed all of the descriptions on various water filters & bought this one specifically because it said it would fit & was the lowest price. Now I'm stuck returning & reordering. Thanks Amazon!"
4,helps make a great cup of coffee,"Apparently the Jura is so smart it tracks whether the filter is replaced in a timely fashion or not; if not replaced properly you may void your warranty. For me, it's worth spending a little extra on these filters so the machine functions properly and it never lets me down in making the very BEST cup coffee."
2,A ok read...,I really like reading Shiloh Walker books but this one was just ok. I didn't like it as much as her other ones.
2,Don't expect much,"VGA/hd with Audio To HDmi format ConverterVGA/HD Format ConverterIf you are connecting laptop with VGA to HDMI TV, you are NOT going to succeed with this device. Scan and sync problems from 720p to 1080i. Successful only in 480p.Needs custom resolutions and sync tweaks. Powerstrip doesn't work in laptops IGP."
4,Converter Works OK,"The converter works, though I have yet to figure out why there is no sound. My television gives me a warning that the signal is not in the correct format.Outside of those two issues, the picture is crisp and clean. It is nice having a 52inch LCD Monitor, even without sound (which I rarely use anyway).For the money, it is worth it if you want to have your laptop appear on your television and if you do not have a HDMI output."
2,"Very standard fare, and uninspiring","I'd compare them to a group you'd find playing in a pub, and you'd have a great time there. But their style of recording just doesn't seem to have much imagination to it. I find myself skipping over songs until I find one that really gives me any real pleasure. I'd compare them to Great Big Sea, about whom I feel the same way (I think they're overrated, but that's another story)."
5,Just like the best pub you can't remember...,If you can't remember the name of the pub but the music sticks with you years after you got home then you've heard Gaelic Storm. Their quick tempo makes you want more.
5,"This junk is the bomb, so says my mom.","My mom knows music, and she says this stuff is the bomb! I know bombs, and bombs are pretty good; they're loud, and they make a big impact, so this CD must be pretty good if she says it's the bomb. I'd trust her. She's always right."
5,Grab a PINT and enjoy this great album!,"Even non-Celtic music fans will be toe tapping, yearning for a pint, and aching to dance a jig...LOL. This CD is a must! CHEERS MATE!!!"
4,Gaelic Storm,"Gaelic Storm is a delightful band. I love the CD, and, should you get a chance to see them in concert, do so."
4,"Great on CD, Fantastic Live","I first saw Galic Storm at the Dublin Pub in Dayton, Ohio. They are all accomplished musicians in their own right. They have a unique repore with the audience, especially during the Guiness chug segment. The songs selection leans toward the fun and toe tapping type....a few serious balads for good measure. Don't hesitate to buy all their albums and see them live...check out galicstorm.com for their concert dates."
5,Party with Gaelic Storm!!!!!,"I love this CD!! I have played and played it and never get tired of it! It is great music in the car, at home, where ever. I wish they would come out with another album. I would buy it in a minute!"
5,Gaelic Storm!!,"I'm an Irish lass who loves good music. This is cool stuff. I love the steerage party in ""Titanic"". I would give this more than 5 stars if I could."
5,I love this CD!! And I'm not even Irish!!!,"I decided to get this CD because I was looking for a celtic type of music to write my stories to. What I got was a rockin' band that really get's you going!! I absolutely love ""Bonnie Ship The Diamond""!! And I'm not even Irish!!(I'm Hawaiian) I would gladly get their next CD!!!"
5,Don't miss!!,I listen to a lot of Irish music and this is by far my favorite CD the best song is Johnny jump up!
2,Could be better,"Listened to this CD...it was OK, but could have been better. While they have an interesting angle, they can't hold a candle to Great Big Sea. I think the majority of their popularity is coming from the movie Titanic. Pretty funny how the band is the only thing that survives the sinking."
2,More Celtic Music,"One of the songs on here was really good, but these guys don't hold a candle to Silly Wizard. Celtic music is becoming too popular, and a lot of the artists are becoming non-descript."
2,Not for a fiddle...,"I enthusiastically bought this CD, looking for a well-rounded Irish band. This isn't it! I was SOOOOO disappointed. Basically, there are two songs on the CD--one with words and one instrumental. All the instrumentals sound so similar as to be almost indistinguishable. I put the CD back for sale on Amazon. Guess I'll get another Corrs. Can't go wrong there!"
5,GREAT BAND!,Wow! This group is so talented! I was lucky enough to catch them live a couple years ago and have loved everything they've done!I highly recommend all of their cd's and GO SEE THEM LIVE!!!! It will be well worth your time and money....it's a great musical performance and they have great sense of humors to boot!
2,You do not get what the picture shows,"I expected to receive what I saw in the picture and thought it was a very fair price. When I received it however, it came in a box not any larger than a 10 pack of reeds. I only got 2 pads and one piece of cork and the cork grease was so small an amount it was hardly worth the plastic it came in. Still, what I did get I was able to use, and I made a couple small repairs."
2,No sheet cork included,This kit lists a piece of sheet cork which is not included. I requested a replacement and I received the very same thing again with no sheet cork. I have two kits now with no sheet cork. The piece of cork in it is for the mouthpiece and is not real cork. I ended up taking my horn to the repair shop and having them recork for me.
3,It's okay,"I've used one of the pads, the glue, and I tried to use the springs, but in all honesty a lot of this repair work takes a good amount of knowledge. It's not quite my place to just up and DO it. Also, the tube of glue sprung a leak (which the leaking glue sealed, haha). Anyway, it's okay, I wish the cork grease was in a chap-stick style container, but oh well."
4,I like this bag,"This is a roomy sleeping bag. I like that the inside is made out of a fleece like material, it's cozy and feels warm quickly"
1,Coleman Alabaster BLACK Sleeping Bag,"I purchased this black sleeping bag from a local store and it was the last one in stock. I ordered the same colored sleeping bag from Target for a friend. Target shows this is a black exterior/grey interior bag like the one I own, but they shipped it in green b/c black is no longer available. I wish they would have that information on their website, b/c I would have not ordered green. Just be aware, several stores show it in black but will ship in green."
3,Mixed feelings about this watch,"First things first, this watch is huuuuuuuuuuge, in my opinion, too huge (except you're over 6'9"" and 250lb). That's not the problem, the problem is that the watch looks cheap. The pull out crown it's tricky and take a while to adjust the hour. If this watch were a little bit smaller it would be ok. The chronograph function is ok and works well. The packaging is amazing. The price is great for what you get. If you want to be noticed, this is the right watch for you."
5,Excelent product!!!,"excelente producto, exactamente como la fotografia, llego sin retrasos, excelente precio, recomendado para todos los compradores venezolanosexcellent product, exactly like the picture, I get no delays, excellent price, recommended to all buyers Venezuelan"
2,"Nice, HUGE watch","This watch is very nice, and of good quality but it is HUGE.Almost big enough to be a novelty clock to hang on the wall.No problems with how it works, just large :)"
3,"great-looking watch, poor performance","This is my second Invicta diving watch. And, just like with first one- the watch fell apart in less then a year. The little knob that one uses to protect the dial-wheel underneath, got disconnected from the main body.And one week ago- wrist band got broken. To get a new wrist band for such a heavy watch, costs about 45-50$!(I guess, the watch's weight puts some good stress on it.)On the positive side, I bought it for about 100$ from Amazon, and you get what you pay for.And remember the looks. You will note find anything that looks that gorgeous for such a price (U-boat watch will set you back 500$)."
2,Good for a while,"I ordered because it was said to be big and easy to read. It is that.Although big it is not uncomfortably big. In the short time I have had it, I have become accustomed to having it on my wrist. Of course, it keeps good time. The stopwatch function is easier to operate than any I have owned before.The only thing I would have had Invicta do a bit differently is the day numbers. There is all kinds of room to have made them bigger and I wish they were.I like the watch and think it to be good value for the money.Update: Sept. 29,2010. The watch kept good time and was durable.I liked it, but its stopwatch sweep hand stopped resetting to zero position. It would return, but not to Zero. this function is important to me. I stupidly bought another model Invicta watch and after less than a year it too started having the identical malfunction."
4,Oversized to say the least!,"I was pleasantly surprised by not only the size of the watch, but the quality. For the price paid ($99) this watch is well worth it. The watch is large, 52mm face, but with the crown this watch's total diameter is about 60mm. Band is nice thick leather 26mm wide. It does not weigh as much as I expected, and weight wise is not that noticable on the wrist. what is noticable is the diameter. If you have small wrists this watch is not for you. Its Japanese Quarts movement."
5,Excellency clock,"This is a very good watch. I think it's one of the best purchases I've made. I recommend, is a good watch."
5,Great Deal.,This product is great and It was on a great price. I would buy any other product from this person again you would never go wrong with products like this.
2,actual watch is not the same with the photo,same as the last reviews. the watch that i received 1. has a BLACK eagle logo. 2. NO JAPAN MOVT. 3. the second timer is on top and the minute timer is at the bottom. but I think the quality is fine*TO AMAZON* i hope you can explain to us why there's a difference.
5,huge is the word that describe this watch.,"Huge, Huge, Huge i like this watch, i am wearing it since usps delivered it, my wife always kidding ""what is the time at the cathedral watch?"" she says."
3,Really Really Really Large!,"Don't overlook the word ""oversize"" in the description. This watch fits a man who is 6'8"" and 360 lbs. My 5'6"" 150 lb husband could have worn this watch on his ankle. I had to return it."
5,really nice,This is a really nice watch. It's as big and heavy as everyone says but I don't find it distracting at all. I bought it when it was about 80 bucks on Amazon. The price has increased a little since then but is still really reduced from the MSRP. It's worth it.
4,big!,"the watch is quite large. it will take up your whole wrist. i don't mind it that much but the thickness creates some issues with button down shirts at the wrist. It is a heavy watch, and the quality of the watch seems good, also it is not that uncomforatable to wear."
1,I am disappointed,"I am much disappointed.Don't waste your money. There is written ""water resistance to 200 meters (660 feet)"" , but it's completely lie, even when you just wash hands water comes inside the watch. Watch arrows (especially small ones) also not work good.in conclusion, I'm much disappointed with this product."
3,Need stronger band,"Watch band need to be stronger, band Keeps popping off.. Like watch face and size . ---- ---- ----- -----"
4,Invicta fan,"I have recently bought a 3449 Corduba. This is my eleventh Invicta so I am clearly a fan. The image of the watch is only slightly inaccurate. The date window does not show three digits as suggested. In fact that is my one criticism. There is no magnifier over the date window making it hard to read. The date window is an important feature for me. Otherwise I am very happy with the watch. I chose it for its style and size and it delivers both of those. All of my Invictas keep perfect time, are stylishand more tan reasonably priced through Amazon. I have actually been in retail shops and seen these products tagged with the suggested price as listed in the Amazon ads. At these prices why wouldn't you own a bunch of them?"
1,No swimming please!,"I bought this watch for my husband's birthday in November and it looks absolutely stunning.Everyone loved it..and then he went swimming with it and instead of being water resistant up to 660 feet, this watch did not even reach the bottom of a 6 feet pool before the face filled with water, which doesn't want to get out at all."
1,stay away from all INVICTA WATCHES sold online,most of the INVICTA WATCHES SOLD BY AMAZON FULLFILMENTSare KNOCK OFFS--- PLS. BUYERS BEWARE.I learned it the hard way
4,"BBW, BIG Beautiful Watch-Great for any man who loves watches","Great for any man who loves watches, but not for the guy who just wants to know what time it is.Well made watch and leather band. Feels very classy to wear and to hold. It looks expensive especially to those not familiar with Invicta. It's huge and gets lots of complements but makes putting your hand in a pocket or reaching into thight spaces almost imposible if you need to reach in deep."
1,Not genuine. . . beware,"This is my second Invicta watch order, and it seems like a knock-off like some others that customers received from Amazon. I plan to return and demand a refund. Unbelievable. I attached a couple of pics so you can see the difference.1. The crown clasp in different and has screws2. The back cover is so different and has different design3. The logo is black vs. silver4. Does not say Japan movement5. Does not say 200 meters on the dial6. The sub-dials are reversedClearly NOT the watch I ordered."
1,Biggest watch ever,"When they say oversized, they mean it! Be sure that is what you are really looking for. It does look just like the picture, but it is BIG. We sent it back because it was....guess what....too big! The case is a very ugly yellow, by the way."
4,Very Nice Watch,Super nice and super big. For the price it is an awesome buy. The look is perfect but it is big. If you are a smaller man don't even think about it. BIG BIG BIG.
5,excelent product,rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego
4,It's huge.,"I knew that it was big when I bought it but I was still surprised. I'm a big guy and it looks out of place on my wrist, if I'm wearing a formal shirt it gets caught in the cuff all the time. Looks good, keeps time and isn't too heavy."
5,EXCELLLENT BUUUYYY,"Bought this for my brother for his birthday..... I personally dont dig this watch that much.. not really my style but its nice for him... perfect. he has always wanted a watch since middle school now were college students and ive always been broke.. so yeah.. its water proof glows in the dark, shipped fast easy to set.. We went sea kayaking for his birthday and we both wore our Invicta watches .. Works fine he loves it.. All the dails and everything work fine... Its starting to grow on me now.."
1,Knock OFF,"Doesn't match the picture of the product in description - doesn't say ""Japan movt"" on the bottom of dial and the bird on dial is painted black, not silver. Knock OFF! Sending back to Amazon asap..."
4,Great Watch; leather band hard to work!,The Invicta Corduba is a great watch and my grandson thinks it's really neat because of it's size. The one difficult quality about this watch is the leather band is very tough to work with because of its thickness. It's hard to thread it through the first holder that's sown into the band almost without injuring yourself. I just use the second one for now and will try to see if I can change the band in the future. A flex stainless steel band might look nice and be easier to put on and off. I think Invicta should also change the operating instructions to something more specific to the watch. Generic instructions just don't cut it with a technical watch.
3,Quality Issues,"I love this watch. I've actually received numerous compliments on it; however, the band does not stay locked on and it continually falls off my wrist. It also won't keep the correct time. I'm really disappointed in the quality.I am deployed to a remote location in Afghanistan and have tried emailing Invicta with no response. I guess this is typical of most manufactures these days. I won't buy another Invicta watch again."
5,a walk on Yawkey Way,"Scott Olivieri does a great job of describing what it means for a lifelong fan to move to the inner circle of the Red Sox. While baseball fans will find plenty of stats and baseball analysis, the casual baseball fan will not feel bogged down in numbers and technical terms. The human story of a young college grad having a chance of a lifetime is compelling as well. Particularly amusing is the story where he can't cash a check from Roger Clemens. Can't wait for the next book!"
2,not high quality,This is a very cheap item. The watch pillows are tiny... I wear invicta watches and these pillows are small to the point of almost seeming like a mistake. And make no mistake the outside does not appear to be real leather but imitation. This may be a bargain at a severe discount but do not pay full price. Also it is made in china if that matters.
2,Recommended Only For Small Wristed Watch Wearing Locksmiths (read on),"Beautiful case in general. Clearly well made and very pretty. That's the good news.Unfortunately, the pillows are very small (comically small) and my watches flop around inside the case, listing dramatically to one side or the other as the watches fall over sideways because they're not at all supported by the pillows. It's unusable, for me anyway. Additionally, the latch was locked (!?) when I received the item. That wouldn't have been a problem had the key not been inside the case. It took me 20 minutes to 'break into' the brand new case. Locksmiths may enjoy the challenge but I didn't. Thank goodness the latch is more for show than to actually secure anything... I think that's good news.. maybe not. I'd recommend this case for storing watches only if you have itsy-bitsy little wrists."
1,NOT AS SPECIFIED...RETURNED,ORDERED FOR MY MENS WATCHES...PRODUCT WAS FOR SMALLER SIZE LADIES WATCHES BUT NOT MENTIONED...RETURNED IMMEDIATELY FOR CREDIT...
4,Adam's Navel by Michael Sims,"This book attempts to explain longstanding anecdotes on parts ofthe human body-their origin, function and meaning. The historyof the handshake is explained. The integration of hand movements and language has an interconnection according to the author.The nose is cited as a part of the body which gets the leastrespect as body parts go. The purity of breasts is extolled inpop art. Overall, the book is a celebration of the human body.A criticism is that it seems to lack a unifying theme or purpose.It is unique in that the information content is out-of-the-ordinary. The author even has a passage describing the arridlandscape on the Marsian planet. The author experiments witha bold escape from conventional writing themes in favor ofamorphous theoretical concepts not subject to exact quantification."
1,Just sticks to the facts.,I found this book quite hard to enjoy because of the author's political and religious insults. If he could have just written about the body parts and not fill the pages with his own personal biases it would have been a much better read.
3,"Intelligence, not Special Forces","This book mostly deals with the intelligence and paramilitary organizations (both government-sanctioned and anti-government) of the many Battletech houses, but does not deal with special forces units. Furthermore, the equipment section is scant, with only a half-dozen items--though these are mostly electronic infiltration and information-extracting aids instead of weapons, specialty uniforms, and the like (let alone specialty 'Mechs/battlearmor). That said, the information they do give is quite exhaustive and thorough, but I was more interested in the things that they ended up leaving out when I bought this book."
2,Wait for Blu-Ray,"If you have a HDTV go ahead and buy this VCR.but...Blu-Ray techonogy will alow you to record 3.5 hours of HDTV on one optical disc, 11 hours of normal TV, plus play all your CDs and DVDs. Blu-Ray will be out on the market Spring 2003.If you need something to record TV, get a S-VHS ET VCR..."
4,Great book! Too bad it is only black and white,"Great book as far as the content is concerned. It is full of sketches and illustrations (sorry, no real photos), packed with detail. There is reference to the anatomical features of all domestic animals (even Llamas), but less info for the pig. There is also mentioning of the clinical importance for several anatomical features, as well as species variations. Very practical indead, clear and detailed illustrations. Humorous animal characters make the material ""ligher"". Recommended especially for vet students like myself. It is a good reference book."
4,Hot Cereal,"This has a different taste that we aren't used to. I was hoping it could be a substitute for oatmeal in cookies, but it didn't work that way. It is a good product and others that I have given it to like it."
1,horrible,"i couldn't stand this album. I am a fan o death metal, but i thought this album reaked. alot of time changes. they deffinatly have a different sound. very original, but i thought it sucked."
1,this stuff is awful,"i recently purchased this stuff thinking , oh mineral foundation wont break out my acne prone skin. yeah it says its noncomedogenic too. well i startd breaking out without reading the ingredients, and guess what there is highly comedogenic ingredients in it. isopropal myistate, lanoline, what the hell were they thinking???? i guess nowadays u can slap noncomedogenic on anything and sell it even though it isn't. i dont recomend this stuff to anyone unless you want pimples."
5,Excellent Speakers for Casual User,"I've had these speakers for only a few days, and I'm already in love with them. Right now, for example, I am enjoying the sounds of my favorite musician eminating, it seems, right from where my monitor is. The subwoofer is incredible - after using standard 2.0 speakers for years I feel like I'm in another world.The tone of these speakers may be a little bright for some, but it's exactly how I like it.I recommend these speakers very highly."
4,Great Value - Good Sound,"Actually I got a much better deal on these speakers at CircuitCity - they had them on sale right before Christmas for $99.00, plus with a mail in rebate of $40.00 if purchased by 12/24 - bringing my total out of pocket cost for these speakers to $49.00. Quite a steal. Setup was clear and quick. I really find the external wired volume control/headphone jack/USB port to be very handy. I wish the speaker cables were a little longer, but for most applications they should be fine. Overall, very nice speakers."
3,good sound but...,"nice sound,but the power supply included was not the original and required modification to remain connected to the main unit. Also Styrofoam peanuts used for packing migrated into subwoofer requiring disassembly to remove"
5,BEST SPEAKERS IVE EVER HERD!!,"I bought these for gaming and they over exceeded my expectations. They have great HIGHS, MIDS, and LOWS. The Bass really kicks and is LOUD, VERY LOUD and clear. I would recommend it for anyone."
4,"Great sound, good looks, a little quirky","I tried out several sets of computer speakers before I brought these home. As soon as I turned them on, I knew they were the right ones for me. In my opinion the sound is fantastic, and I really like the look of these too. The only thing I don't like about them is the controls are not on the speakers, but on a little hockey puck thing that sits on your desk, so there is one more cord to deal with and one more bit of clutter on your desk. Also, because it sits flat on your desk the on/off/volume knob obscures the power light (so you can't tell if they're on or not) and you can't tell where the knob is set. These are minor quibbles though...overall I love these and if not for the quibbles would give them 5 out of 5 stars.P.S. I knew I made the right choice when my girlfriend walked in and said, ""Wow, those speakers sound great...are they new?"" Score."
4,which one is better?,"can anyone help me about those 2: is L3500 or is L3450 better, please share your opinion."
4,Product good - support not so good.,"I am pleased with this scanner for the most part. I purchased it to scan glass negatives up to 8 x 10, it does that pretty well. Loading the software and working with Windows 7 64bit, I had a couple of problems with the scanner not being in sync with the software. Epson support leaves much room for improvement. First, you have to pay for the phone call even on a brand new unit. Yes, you can send an email and in a day or two you can get a message back saying the same thing you find in the trouble shooting from the help guide on the software. But say that you do call them, you will get a person in a call center that will read off their screen - the same thing.I got the bugs worked out of the system with the help of my son, completely removing the enclosed software and downloading the latest version directly. Scanner works fine, pretty slow on high resolution scans. Wish they made a flash scanner that scanned the whole image at one time."
3,It's Ok but lookout for dirt on inside surface of glass,"Purchased a V700 from Epson early December 2009. After a few days using it I became aware of dirt and haze on the inside surface of the scanning surface glass.Contacted the Epson store and they sent a replacement, plus free return shipping for the original purchased unit.The second scanner had similar dirt on the inside of the glass. There is a section on the scanning surface I avoid when scanning high quality scans.All attempts, including a written letter mailed to the main mailing address, to contact someone responsible for product quality went unanswered.I kept the second unit and use it because I do not expect a 100% clean product from Epson.The scanner produces high quality images.The only major drawback is the lack of support for many of the popular film formats used in the last few decades."
5,"Pricey, but worth it!","I did a lot of research on scanners before I bought the V700. My requirements are to be able to scan everything from 35mm slides and negatives to 4X5 transparencies and negatives. This replaces an older Epson flatbed/film scanner that I thought was doing a good job, until I scanned the same negative on the V700. Holding the resolution constant between the two, and scaning the same 4X5 BW negative, the scans seem sharper with better contrast. Controlling a scan is easy with the provided software. I have scans from a dedicated 35mm film scanner and find that scans from the V700 range from nearly as good to better than the dedicated scanner results (all run at 3200 dpi). It installed very easily into Adobe Photoshop CS3. I definitely recommend it!"
2,"Good scanner, not such a good company","The scanner is pretty good, but Epson no longer deserves a high reputation as a company. They advertise, for example, that your package includes Adobe Photoshop Elements, but what you get is Elements version 3, which has been obsolete for 3 years! Elements 6 is the current version. And,if you check their website there is no provision to make general contact to register a complaint."
2,Poor documentation,"Poor documentation for the Epson V700 scanner, in fact there is no written documentation.For example, to get instructions for loading and scanning a film strip you have to wade through a cumbersome file-a so-called User Guide.Considering the price of this scanner, the least Epson could have done is furnish a User Guide on a CD."
4,Very efficient and well designed - highly recomment it.,"Over the last 40 years of photography, I have accumulated about 10,000 film negatives and slides from the 35 mm and 120 mm film era. These were in boxes, envelopes and other packages that were slowly deteriorating. Temperature, moisture and scratches were going to make these negatives unusable.V700 solved this problem. I was able to restore about 1000 ea over the last few weeks by digitizing and cataloging these so I can search and access what I want.Once scanned, I can fix some color and scratch damages using photoshop and other SW products. V700 allows upto 24 ea of 35mm negatives to scan at one time but I am able to use only 16 ea at a time since all the film strips were cut at 4 ea.Regardless, it has a decent scanning speed at 4800 dpi. if you check the options to correct for backlight, grain and dust - it does a good job to apply these corrections.I recommend it and I am very happy with this product."
5,Fits the bill,"I bought this scanner to digatize old photos and slides. I think it does a great job. It's pretty putzie to go through all the steps to get the scans if you want high quality. Batch scan, frame, zoom to get frame exactly right, adjust color/exposure/contrast/repair/etc. and then final scan. The frames for slides works well and you can do 12 at a time. High quality scanner that fits the bill for me."
1,Not good- constantly warming up,"Epson discontinued it's 1680 scanner and this seemed to be it's replacement. I'm not sure if the one I received was broken, but it stalled for 1 minute to ""warm up"" every time you changed between reflective to transmissive scan methods. The 1680 did not do this.Maybe I'm in the minority, but my normal usage is to scan a document, then 1 or more associated transmissive images. This was a show stopper for me, so back it went."
2,Complicated software- support has not responded yet.,Epson Perfection V700 scanner seems to make a very good scan. We purchased it to scan x-rays. Software is very complicated and have not gotten our response back from support yet.
4,epson V700,"Received in good shape, double boxed. I use this scanner for TEM 3 x 4"" negatives, and it does a better job than my previous Afga Duoscan T2500 whichworked well for almost ten years before developing vertical banding.Scanner is fast (two negatives in 2.5 minutes). One speck of dust under the glass unfortunately, will have to live with that as no luxury of sending back.All and all, a great purchase at the price, now let's see how long it workswithout any issues"
3,Great scanner. Terrible software.,"This is an incredible scanner. The capabilities go far beyond most of the competition. Epson should however be embarrassed by the included software, and whoever made the recommendation and final decision should be fired. The functionality and UI are both so bad as to make them unusable except for the simplest tasks. Not what I expect from a scanner in this price range."
3,Would not fit charger,Lenmar advertised this battery as replacement for my camcorder. I don't know if the battery works or not because it would not fit my charger. My charger came with my camcorder and it works with current batteries. The metal terminals on the Lenmar would not mesh with charger. Lenmar needs to check and correct before advertising it as replacement for Panasonic PV-GS320. Amazon has been concerned and helpful in offering refund.
4,Good Value,"This battery is working fine for me so far. My camera was practically useless with my aged batteries, and now is back in action, so I'm happy. Price and speed of shipping was very good."
4,Great for the Price,This item is absolutely fabulous and serves its purpose for the price. Highly recomend for pressure point massages.
4,Throw 'em a life-Bowie!,"Alongside several Mick Ronson solo releases and the one lone ""Spiders From Mars"" album, ""Woody Woodmansey's U-Boat"" completes the answer to any ""whatever happened to..."" questions regarding David Bowie's backup musicians from the ""Ziggy"" period (Woodmansey was the drummer). Although it bears no resemblance to Bowie material, this album, (once you get past the band's silly name and the comic book cover art)actually turns out to be a rather tasty collection of mid-70's power pop. The songs are quite catchy, usually sporting a heavy riff tempered by Beatle-y chords and vocals. Bowie completists will probably want a copy, as well as anyone who enjoys ""roots"" power pop like Artful Dodger,Topaz,or Badfinger.Remastering is excellent;part of a series of Bowie-related reissues by a British label."
4,Lots of Teaching Ideas,"If you're looking for a compilation of teaching ideas to suit the needs of your students, this is a great book. The downside of this book is that it does not have any colorful images so as to give the reader a better idea of how these strategies work. But you can always use the internet to further your knowledge of the strategies."
4,Very nice,Very nice headset. Light-weight. Flexible boom mic is great. Only drawback for me: no mute switch.
5,LOVING KINDNESS FOR THE SOUL!!!,"This wonderful ""cookbook"" of loving kindness will find it's way to just where it belongs, everywhere. A companion piece for life and love and joy. Thank you, Barbara, for honoring the soul. We ARE one."
2,The Picture....,"...is misleading. As another reviewer stated, the product looks cheap. The photo is not a true depiction of the necklaces. I have yet to wear it."
4,Get Ripped Old Fashion Style,"What a video! This is a no nonsense balls to the wall workout video. If you want girls in tight spandex bending over showing you...well you know, forget it! This is the real Navy Seals in training with real instructurs walking about yelling at them.The workout itself is intense and focuses on strength training using your own bodyweight for resistance.Expect varations on countless pushups-situps and pull ups, neck and triceps.Some of the reps are really high and you'll have to build up to it to really participate to the full degree. In any case expect to wake up the next morning with something sore."
5,I got really buff,"Yo, This video helped me get ripped muscles, I am very buff since I bought this video. You should buy it if you want to be buff."
5,REAL anerobic workout,this is probably the best workout video you can buy. It is very testing and requires nothing more than pull-up and dip bars. I defy anyone to complete it properly first time. A definite cut above the rest.
4,Keep it on the counter.,"The Hildebrand cook book is very useful to me. I'm not a gourmet; I don't even like to cook that much (yet must do it three times a day). Somehow knowing that any of the interesting dishes in this fat book can be created with just three ingredients actually makes me want to whip something up. Even I can manage three ingredients! I like the fact that they include ""add it in"" items beyond the three. The add-ins are still simple, but make me feel like a real cook, by deciding whether to embelish. This is the only cook book I actually keep on my counter."
2,there are misleading reviews for this item...,"i found that unlike this book states, and as some reviewers wrote, this book does not help with calculus based physics. i tried using it for my second semester physics class (the 2nd half of the book), and it was not helpful. it is just a bit of an easy review, it does not have a very wide range of problems, just a bunch of easy repetitive problems, and then some difficult ones which do not even have much clarification as to how some steps are performed and why. this book also seems to be outdated (from the 80s), but i didnt buy the newer version because reviewers didnt recommend it. all in all, i would not recommend this to college students, and not to their instructors either, just high school students and maybe their teachers of conceptual physics (intro course). i think that when looking for helpful books, it is best to actually see them, and not purchase something online because now i regret spending my money on this."
1,Not recommended...,"As many books from Schaum Series, this book is also useless and time consuming. It seems, the book tries to teach you the formula by making you put the numbers in right places. The book says: ""F=m.a"" learn this and solve F=100 N, m=2 kg, find the acceleration. Of course, I exaggerated a bit. But really: NO THINKING, NO GAIN. Don't buy this book (and maybe other Schaums)..."
4,book of answers,The guide has help me to figure out what to do with the equations given in physics. The equations are easy to remember but difficult to pull out if the written questions on most exams. This book gives a good overall view of the ways professors will present the problems annd makes it easier pick out similarities.
3,Has not helped,"This book has not helped me at all in my physics class, mainly because the problems are nothing like the ones my teacher assigns. They are all much easier."
5,"Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Physics (Schaum's Outline Series)",very good thank you so much. amazon company the great company and I find very interesting book in this company
3,Schaum's Solve Problems,"The information in this problem book are many and some pertain to all physics have similar concepts in the way Alvin Halpen,PH.D has structure this book. Yet, for the newcomer in Physics will not easily understand. This book for resource and problems is fair!But not recommended!"
5,My son loved watching this OVER & OVER,"This is great to add to your kids(or yours, if your a big kid like me) collection. I loved watching the Rugrats with my son. It was a favorite of mines as a child. My son watched these movies over and over."
1,Nice looking but terrible sound,"If you're looking for a bongo drum to play, this is DEFINITELY not what you want. Its sound is horrid to be completely unplayable.If you're looking for an African looking ornament/decoration, this is a good idea, just don't expect to be making any music on it, at all."
4,very good mixer,very inexpensive mixer with very good quality and sound processing what else can you ask .
5,Great little treasure,"I have been dabbling in the area of live music, podcasting, and listening to music for a few years. I decided to get some more equipment. This mixer has been working well for a while now. It has multiple inputs and outputs, more than I will use by myself. One thing I use it for is to connect and add 8 inputs and 3 outputs to my laptop. It provides sound and monitors for all of the audio devices I use. It works well, all of the knobs turn and switches turn on and off. I don't mind unplugging it each night, so that is not an issue for me. I like it and I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a smaller and lower priced alternative to the large 16 or 24 channel mixers."
4,good every day stainless,This was a nice set of every day stainless. It was substantial and classic. The price was excellent. I just wish that extra completer sets were available.
4,a steal,this is a STEAL for $40.nice design. although a bit lighter than i thought they would be. just need to buy a caddy for them.all around good sturdy flatware with a hostess set to boot.
3,"Could be better, but good enough.","Not much to say. I enjoyed the album, it was amusing enough. I definately agree that it wasn't nearly as good as previous ones. My only complaint about any of his songs is that he really doesn't have any rhythm if that's the right word. The music itself and the lyrics are enough to draw me in though. I would recommend though if some of you haven't heard of Q-Strange to search around for his stuff. He takes an interesting approach. Start with 'Creation to ExeQtion' you won't be disappointed. I would love to see Q and Necro do something together if they haven't already."
3,Jack Light is an idiot!!!,"Necro and the Psychologial/Uncle Howie crew are ""Death Rap"". It is not a weakness to listen to it. It is no different than watching a scary movie. I too listen to the Visionaries, 2-Mex, LMNO, Writers Block, etc. But when I'm in the mood I throw in Gore or Ill Bill and escape into another world with them. OPEN YOUR MIND JACK!!! Go buy a DC Talk album and leave the Death Rap to the people that can handle it!!!!!"
2,Great production with redundant filler.,Necro is one of the illest producers in Hip Hop right now hands down. But on the mic he's a redundant cliche'. The production soundscape is great but material wise if you've heard one Necro song you've heard them all. If he stayed behind the boards and let his brother Ill Bill handle the mic duties he'd be much better off.
4,Great .... but too new to old time rage fan like me...,"Finally I got rage DVD today. I've been a huge RAGE fan since 1991 when I bought their album SECRETS IN A WEIRD WORLD. This DVD is totally worth to buy for their fan.... They looks a lot better than before. On live (DVD1) they are playing very profesionally(This does not mean they were not profesional). they looks new their sound is great and great live performance. But I feel something strange to them. mmmm.... They are not old time RAGE anymore. They are not RAGEous, and not wild. As time goes by almost all bands are getting better, more profesional look, and smooth playing and performance. But that is not for all fans. And that is why I give them 4 stars instead of 5. But they also give their old time video clips for the old fans like me. Old fans Must watch DVD2. They are real RAGE on it. Great DVD, must buy......."
5,The history of 20 years are in this DVD,"This anniversary DVD is for all Rage fans all over the world. Very pleased with the concert in disc 1. The show is very great. The sound quality is great, too. The songs range from the early day of Avenger to the first album of Rage ""Reign of Fear"" to the latest album.Disc 2, you will see the documentary of the band for 50 minutes. How the latest line-up met, where were the new members come from. See how they record orchestra part in ""Lingua Mortis"" period. And see the begining of the band when Peavey still thin with long hair.All MV of the band, the recording session of some songs and some bonus live songs also include.If you're interested in this band, don't hesitate to buy this DVD. It's worth the money."
5,Neu Melodic Moods,"Simplistic review here: Beautiful piece of composition. Seeland is just timeless any way I look at it, as is Leb Wohl. Just both so subtle, so emotional, refined, brilliant. Hero is this punky indie funk track that really kicks up the energy, while E-Musik slows it down again as one of the trippier tracks, short and bold in atmosphere. After Eight brings it back up to pace with more punk sounds, and I can even see some sex pistols in it; I would even go so far as U2. Great guitars with layered melodies throughout the album. Overall the most accessible Neu! record in my opinion. There certainly is an escape from the experimentation in previous albums in exchange for something more listenable, and something that can be enjoyed at face value for the layman. Recommended for the beginning Krautrock fan. The roots start here"
2,A real zealot here.....,"I had thought, based on the cover blurb, that this would help me appreciate and work with my kids - turned out it was a real guilt trip (shame on me for doing so unnatural a thing as send them to school etc....). I think the worst turn-off was the way she kept patting herself on the back for doing such a great job. I'm sure she is a good mom, I'm equally sure that there are a wide variety of ways to be a good mom. Partularly baffled by all these kids she knows who deny their pain and bravely pretend they enjoy school, so as not to upset their parents - mine surely have no reservations about sharing the vast number of ways in which it does not meet their expectations (as so much of life fails to do. Too bad.)Anyway, buy this if you are a committed home schooler and want to be affirmed."
4,You can't not find something to like !,"I'm not really a fan of progressive metal, but I love this cd and was hooked on it for quite a while. Of course, as you would expect, the playing is superb all around - I especially liked Terry Bozzio on drums and John Petrucci on guitar. However, what really makes this album shine is the strength of the compositions themselves. Trent Gardner has written some great music here ! There is a bit of padding throughout (probably needed to accommodate all the solo spots), but the clever contrast in dynamics makes it all flow nicely. My favorite aspect of Gardner's music has always been that the vocals are the focal point - and I really enjoyed the strong performances of all the singers on this project."
4,Explorers Club leads a tremendous progressive endeavor,"_Age Of Impact_ is a 5 song (each averaging over 10 minutes) concept album of sorts written by Magellan's Trent Gardner about the current prog scene. It features many of today's and yesterday's most progressive ""explorers"" (John Petrucci, James Labrie, Steve Howe, Terry Bozzio, Bret Douglas, Billy Sheehan, DC Cooper) performing traditional Gardner arrangements. The talent on this album is incredible, with excellent guitar and keyboard solos throughout. There are also notable vocal performances by DC Cooper (Royal Hunt, solo), James Labrie (DT), Bret Douglas (Cairo) and others. The cd is not great, in my opinion, but it is very good (I'd probably give it three and a half stars if I could). Much like Magna Carta's Liquid Tension Experiment project, the talent featured on this album is incredible (especially some of Petrucci's solo work), and my collection would not be complete without it."
4,"Slightly misleading packaging, but great music nonetheless.","You'd think this was an all-star session with everybody who's anybody in prog and prog/metal; it's not. The disk is mainly Bozzio, Sheehan, Gardner and Petrucci, with a different vocalist on most each track, and small, mostly meaningless cameos by other luminaries. If you want to hear Steve Howe, don't buy this disc.On the other hand, the music is wonderful overall. I really like the first 3 tracks, and the last 2 are OK. While the mix is a little muddy for Bozzio and Sheehan, the really are great, and Petrucci does nice stuff (with the exception of a tedious extended run-out on the last track.Buy this disc!"
4,EC best of Magna Carta by far,"Once you explore the world of Magna Carta you find out that every body sounds like every body and they dare to compare themselves with the real fathers of prog-rock (Floyd, Yes, Genesis, Camel, KC,ELP,Tull, among others) but besides the efforts by Liquid Tension this AGE OF IMPACT ROCKS each song just flows like real prog pros and lets face it forget about the vocals its the sound of the talent Terry Bozzio'just magnificent, John Petrucci gives us an honest effort and Trent G has never been surrounded by better musicians, also the solos by sherinian are v. good... you're not gonna waste your money...this one's a winner"
3,Too Many Cooks...,"The instrumental and vocal talents involved in this album are without a doubt some of the best in the business, and Trent Gardner has done quite a job with the compositions and lyrical lines. There is one problem with Age of Impact, however, and that is too many players! The instrumental lines cover up the vocal lines at times (with the exception of DC Cooper's performance which was nothing short of grand) and often times seem cluttered and uneventful. Basically, it could have been better, but still a noble addition to any collection."
5,Magna Carta stable at its best!,"I must say I don't like Magellan too much ( see my reviewes), but... When Trent Gardner does something with someone else, he does it very good! Another good thing about this album is James LaBrie and other good singers ( not Trent!) sings a healthy chunk of songs. Arrangements are very good-crafted; the recording and sound quality are almost great.Trent, you're great producer!This album is a kind of ""the best of Magna Carta"". So, buy it, if you like ""Magna Carta"" sound ( or just quality prog rock with a touch of heavy arrangement!).I heard from grape-vine it's going to be Explorer Club -II. If it's true, I'll definitely buy it!"
4,Age of Impact sums up Magna Carta,"I love the DC Cooper part of the song. Amazing, how different voices saying the same thing can have such an impact."
1,i tried to like this.....really i did,With all the names that are on this disc and all that talent it really made me wonder why i had a hard time getting through a second listening of this wasteful piece of crap....i can only hope that all those guys can look back on this and swear to never lend their names to anything like this again. But you know what? Even though some of the liquid seeps through the hole in this coaster its better than no coaster at all!
2,Regrettable,"Although erotic manga has its appeal, this titlelacks any of its own. The quality of the art isacceptable if not impressive and the translationisn't bad, but that's the best I can say. TheJapanese have endless hentai titles to choosefrom while only a choice few are ""de-censored""and translated into English so you'd expect thosetitles that are available to be the cream of thecrop. Not so in this case. Immoral Angelfollows a bizzare and fairly uninteresting plotinterspersed with scenes of violent rape andsexual assault against initially innocent girls.If that's your thing you'll probably enjoy thistitle, if not, there's not much else to redeemImmoral Angel. I could barely stomach the firstvolume so it may improve as the series progresses.I'm sure some of those girls will eventually gettheir revenge, but I won't be picking up anynew issues to find out."
4,Very good resource,This book is a great source of center material. I was able to put the pocket folder centers together in on hour (not counting laminating). The hanger centers are a little bit harder for the children to work with and take more time to put together. The shoe box centers also take more time to construct but are easily used by the children. I recommend this book. I was able to quickly add new centers to my collection. The centers are colorful and engaging. A worksheet is included on which children can record their work. I wish there was another book like this with additional centers that was strictly pocket folder centers--they are so easy to store and take up so little space. I did adapt some of the non-pocket folder centers into pocket folder centers.
1,Mostly things I already knew,I was diasppointed that this is a rather basic book for people who are not aware of ageing and nutrional issues.
2,Null and Void,"After reading Gary Null's book, I was disappointed, because I was expecting to learn more than what I already know. Also, the repetition in this book was obnoxious. There were a couple of things that didn't ring true and I circled them for further research. If anyone has felt that anything in this book was not exactly accurate, I would love to hear from you. On a scale of 1 - 10, I give it a 4."
3,OK,"This book is pretty good if you haven't read any other books by Null. If you have, I would forget about it. Mainly because he doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The only difference between Power Aging and his previous books are in the way the information is arranged. Other than that, it is basically recycled material. Good for a new reader but almost a waste of time for people who have read something published by Null in the past."
3,Good reference but poor production,"This is a comprehensive and authoritative text describing the problems that can affect concrete, and how they can be recognised petrographically. It has a valuable set of 83 colour plates appended that are referenced in the text. These are reasonable quality, but the numerous black and white images spread throughout the text are very poor quality in this edition (which was transferred to digital printing in 2005). They are mostly too dark to discern details, which in a book that costs as much as this does is unacceptable."
5,Heavy Rotation!!!!,"This album needs to be in everyone's cd player. R&B needs a new voice and Eric Roberson has it. So often on the radio, everyone sounds exactly alike and they all sing over popular producer beats just to get a hit. If you're tired of the radio, tune in to this CD. You can play the entire album without skipping a beat."
4,A GREAT CD !,Eric Roberson's lyrics and melodies are beautiful. I have heard songs he has written for artist like Musiq and others but his style really shines through on this full-length CD !...Beautiful music....bring us more Eric !
2,MP3 Player from RCA Model M2000 with 512 MB SD Card Slot,"I got an RCA Lyra RD 1076 512MB at Christmas. The unit was DOA and never powered up so Thomson sent me the M2000 512 as replacement. Believe it or not the new unit wouldn't turn on either. Of course we tried new batteries, reversing the battery, battery tester and holding the on button for over a minute. I was sent another identical replacement unit. This one consumes a brand new energizer or duracell battery in less than an hour. When you remove the battery and put in a tester, it still reads very good! So this one is also being replaced. I went with the RCA because I keep everything on SD Cards. I like the looks and feel of the unit. When it worked, I had no complaints. Support has been responsive. Judging from the other reviews it looks like I have just had a bad run of luck."
2,"OK, I guess, for short pieces.","Pro: inexpensive. Secure digital card slot. Sound is OK.Con: About 1/3 of the time I can't turn it on without popping the battery out and back in. I don't know if this is common or mine just has a defect.Menus are a little cumbersome to navigate.Most serious to me is that this player will lose it's place in a file if the player is turned off. This would not be a problem for someone listening to pop music. I use my player to listen to speech. A typical file I will listen to will be one to two hours long. I do _not_ want to have to memorize where I left off, and find it again with with fast forward."
3,"misleading title, someone set up a video camera at a lecture","Not much talk about the ancient idea of this planet X. The only topic that I found insteresting was the talk about mars. Highly unprofesional, it looks as if some guy had his video camera out at a lecture. Even with that, had the info been good I would have been happy enough, but saddly it never came through."
1,I should have read the reviews,"I should have took the time to read the reviews, they were spot on. Not only is it not professionally produced, it literally ends mid sentence. I am amazed it is being offered by for rent, I would expect more out of an elementary school student project. DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY ! there are much better ways to spend both."
1,Very Disappointed,Thought this was going to be a Sci-fi movie but instead it is a filming of a speech at a confernece somewhere. A very boring conference at that. Would not advise wasting your money on this film at all
1,RIPOFF,"Amazon needs to either pull this from their inventory OR put a free rental on this. Poor quality, poor production, poor editing."
2,"Sound intriguing, but...",I was hoping for more evidence closer to main stream science/archeology. Not as interesting as I had hoped it would be.
2,not a very good one,"This movie was ok but they did not put much into it,poor quality,bad audio, and not much in the way of presentation."
4,Christian New Age????,"To those that see/read ""Christian or New Age"" please keep in mind it's one or the other. To say Christian New Age is like saying ""Its Black White."" It can't be both... I think the Pastor's review is best, Its spiritual/inspired. And to say it has a Christian moral blah blah blah... Think about it... ""Peace on Earth and good will towards man."" What is so bad about THAT????? Come on people THINK would you??? Some of you... no let me say MOST of you people are giving earthlings a bad name. Christian New Age.... get a clue. Oh yeah, the album is pretty good... some of the reviews... not so. PS.. have a grooooovy day."
2,Disappointing,"As a stand-alone novel ""Final Justice"" was readable, although not one of Griffin's best. However, as a continuation of the Badge of Honor series it was a severe disappointment. The continuity problems described by other reviewers were jarring, to say the least. Also, the intricate descriptions of everyday modern electronics (cell phones, digital cameras, laptop computers) made for a very tedious read at times."
2,I've heard of literary license...,"...but this was kind of off-putting.Full disclosure: I have read every single WEB Griffin book available (Brotherhood, Corps, BoH, etc.) and as a rule love each and every one of them.But the singular sensation of having a storyline that for all the previous books was so obviously early 1970's ripped into the present day wasn't a very satisfying one. Part of the thrill of reading the early BoH novels was seeing the characters deal with the 'limited technology' available in 1975. People actually could drop off of the face of the earth for a day if they weren't near a phone - now Griffin has to invent weak explainers as to why the persons cell phone didn't get answered.For someone who picks this up at the airport bookstore it's going to be a great read but for those of us who have followed the careers of Matt Payne and Peter Wohl through the series it's disconcerting at best.Cheers!"
3,Suggestion From the AUTHOR,The author W.E.B. Griffin was signing books here and said that when he saw the paperback for this latest Badge Series he was floored. He states that it will be pulled and be reissued and be a collectors item because the Badge on the front is a NY City Badge and not a Philly Badge as all the other badges are on all the Hardbacks and all the other paperbacks. It is only this paperback that is different. I would get it.
4,Better than the last one,"Yes, there are continuity problems. I for one would have liked an explanation on Carlucci's exit (by the way, he was so much like Rudy Giuiliani it is scary). Also, Lt. Washington was an issue, albeit smaller. The rest were not a problem for me.However, the bottom line is that this was an excellent book. The stories were quite interesting, and I love what happened to Matt Payne. He grew as a character.I cannot wait for the follow up."
4,Go With The Flow,"Hey, Griffin fans, let's lighten up. This is a cop novel, not holy writ. If you've enjoyed Griffin's earlier novels, and can relax and enjoy his characters' adventures (professional and personal), you'll enjoy this book a lot. If you're tracking who had what rank and what color car in earlier books in the series, then this book may puzzle you. Me? I enjoy Griffin, not exegesis. (I gave the book 4 rather than 5 stars because I thought it left too many loose ends.)"
3,Time Warp!!!,"I have been an avid reader of Griffin's books for years now,... I was suprised to find that the characters of Final Justice have time warped 30 years into the future without explanation or aging. Key characters have disappeared or transformed into different positions since the last book (which supposedly only took place six months ago). At first I though I was confused until I saw similar observations by other readers at this site. Having said that, I still enjoyed the book immensely, but I would hope that future books in this series returns to the 1970's, and we can pretend this episode was a dream."
2,Let's have a little consistency here.....,"I expected a lot better here. The first novels in the series were set clearly in the early to mid 1970's. All of a sudden, Griffin shifts to the present, with the cell phones and laptops and the Buick whatever (???). With that glaring time shift, and nobody getting any older (i.e. Matt's still in his 20's), it made the plot and storyline fade into the background. I spent the whole time reading it looking for timeline inconsistencies. I'd really like to know who actually wrote this one, because it wasn't up there with the rest of Griffin's works and didn't read like his other novels."
1,Absoloute Junk!,"The characters have been weakend. The plot is so convoluted, it's not even funny. Don't even get me started on the total lapse in continuity!The time line has progressed 30 years with no aging of the main characters. The series has gone from the rich vibrant atmosphere of 1970's Philly to 2003 cliches! They even made a refrence to the Soprano's for God's sake! This book is a joke! It was obviously written not only by an author who is not W.E.B. Griffin, but this guy didn't even read the previous books in the series for character details!As the title of my review states; ABSOLUTE JUNK!"
2,Why was this book written?,"I was really surprised to see this latest installment of the Badge Of Honor series. I figured that Matt Paine had killed any hope of a police career after his screw-ups in The Investigators. How does a cop go against the advice and orders of his superiors, get a witness/informer killed and still have a job? I don't care how high in the police establishment your rabbi is, he may help you avoid jail time but your job would be toast.Another thing that I didn't like about the novel was my growing dislike of Matt Paine. If an author is constructing a series of books around a central character shouldn't he try to make the guy likeable? In the last few books I started to find myself wishing the spoiled rich kid would actually start paying a price for his arrogance.After I read this book I just stopped reading this series. I jumped over to the Presidential Agent series and find them a good read, wordy in parts, but I still like the characters."
4,Time Warp,"I absolutely love W.E.B. Griffin's novels. I have read all of his series and am so enamored with the way that he details his characters. With that said, I was somewhat surprised and amazed at the dramatic time shift he did between this book and the previous book The Investigators. He went from having the characters having to use payphones to everyone having cell phones and laptops. That rang kind of hollow to me so it did put me off somewhat. However, the book was still a good one and a must read for any WEB Griffin fans. Just know that you won't be picking up the book with the same sort of timeline."
2,Same Author?,"I started reading this series after having enjoyed other Griffin series. As was the case with the other ones, I truly became addicted to this one, that was until this novel. Within a few pages I could not help but wonder if it was actually written by another author, since the story (timeline, characters, etc.) had changed significantly. Perhaps, it would be a good book by itself, but as a fan of the series I now find myself looking for the differences in the characters and the storyline instead of reading the book. How can one go from needing to find a phone booth (in the last book) to now having a cell phone available...a 30 year jump in time but the character's ages remained the same...frustrating. If you are going to read the series, don't consider this as part of that read."
1,EDITOR WANTED-PLEASE!,"IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO ONE WHO EVER READ A PREVIOUS BADGE OF HONOR SERIES NOVEL HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH EDITING THIS ONE.NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I WONDER IF ANYONE LITERATE EVER READ THIS BEFORE PRINTING. THE MISTAKES IN CONTEXT, SPELLING, ETC.,ETC. DEFY DESCRIPTION.WHAT HAPPENS ON THESE SERIES NOVELS? DOES THE AUTHOR SEND IN A VERY SHORT OUTLINE, AND THEN THOSE FAMOUS MONKEYS WRITE THE BOOK?I HAVE ENJOYED THIS AUTHOR'S WORK IN THE PAST, BUT THIS ONE IS JUST TOO CHEEZY!"
2,Disappointing book in a great series,"I loved all of the other books in the series, but this book was very disappointing. The time frame of the book was placed in modern day, versus in the seventies, yet the characters are all of the same age. The seventies time frame made gave the series some flavor that this one was missing. The series was great until this book as it was realistic. In this book matt Payne becomes a super cop and is using his gun more often than any other cop. The other books were good to not make it a Hollywood gun battle, but this book was no where as creative or enjoyable as the others."
5,How to make a Ghille,"I bought this DVD to learn how to make a Ghille suit. This DVD does an excellent job giving the step by step process on how to do this. I knew nothing about making a ghille before watching this and my ghille turned out excellent.A few suggestions if you use this to make your ghille.1. Don't use the shoe goo, sew your netting on... it's MUCH more secure2. You need to give your burlap or jute a ""hair cut"" so it isn't so uniform"
5,Danticat is a master story-teller.,"I bought this book for my granddaughter and wound up reading it myself. Edwidge Danticat is one of my favorite authors. I thought I had read everything of hers and then came across this marvelous story of a Haitian Princess. Danticat describes a lost culture through her story-telling and gives young girls and women another great role model of wisdom, strength, character, and courage."
4,Wonderful Massager,"While it looks a little like a medieval torture device, it gives a wonderful back and or leg/foot massage. The first day that I used it, lower back pain that I had for a number of years was gone!! I use the chair daily, and the pain has not returned. It feels so good after a day of golf or other physical activity. At first, i thought it was too rough, but that is not the case any longer. The price was right, and it has the same internal mechanisms as chairs costing much more. The only drawback to getting the vinyl instead of the leather is the ""squeaky"" noises the vinyl makes when reclining the chair. The controls offer a large variety of different massages that you can customize to your needs and feelings. Great purchase!"
4,Great Value,"NEW PRIVATE MASSEUSE iJoy 320 Robotic Human Touch Massage Chair / ReclinerThis chair has many options found in higher priced models. It offers 4 different types of massage, electric recline, and full, upper or lower massage modes. It also has an attached calf and foot massage unit. Very relaxing at the end of a long day!"
5,"Profound, moving, timeless&#65533;also full of suspense. Classic!","John D. MacDonald scored again with this atmospheric, deeply moving novel about a man both coming to terms with the death of his wife and the wilful self-destruction of his best friend. As usual with John D., the sentiments expressed about life, people and the state of the world in the last half of the millenium are timeless. Why aren't these books more readily available? We are in desperate need of classics like this."
5,The Yoga of Drawing by Jeanne Carbonetti,This is a terrific book for those people who don't have fabulous drawing skills. It helps you understand how you can create wonderful drawings that are expressive even if you don't draw. It's a wonderful companion to Jeanne Carbonetti's other two books.
5,Gorgeous pictures!! Beautiful poems!!,"These are original poems/lullabies from people living on the islands. My 7 year old loves this book. Even if you never read it all, the book is worth it for the fabulous artwork. This would be a great gift for anyone who has lived in the islands or feels connected to the sea."
1,Short lived piece of junk !,"This Dry Top 208108 8-by-10-Foot Super Heavy-Duty 10-Millimeter UV Treated Tarp is a joke in every way. Placed into service at the end of June, this thing is already flaking away on the brown surface and is also now leaking water in the ""compromised"" areas. Not ""Super Heavy Duty"" by any stretch of the imagination, in fact, far less durable than the cheapo, paper thin blue tarps that cost approx. 1/3 as much money. Only guaranteed for 1 month, that should be be a warning to anyone considering buying this product from this seller."
1,Less than 8 months of service,"This tarp was done after 8 months in the SoCal sun. I am very disappointed in its UV resistance and overall performance,"
2,Not So,"Definitely not what I thought it was. I thought that the product was made of a different, more solid material."
3,A History of the World Hockey Association,"Greig fills his book with WHA statistics and trivia, but the best part is the narratives spoken by the players. Almost to a man they state they were indentured to the clubs of the National Hockey League. Teams mailed contracts with the dollar amounts filled in. No negotiation. Sign it or be sent to the minors. Goaltender Ken Brown wrote baseball's Curt Flood a letter thanking him for challenging the reserve clause and the status quo. A good book for anyone interested in Hockey and how its system has evolved."
1,Dissapointing & Bad Service,I had ordered the shoe in mid November and my shoe has not come till now.I received a mail asking me whether I wanted to extend the time as it was not available. I was supposed to get it in 1st week of January and till now I have not received any kind of communication from Amazon.If you do not have an item please dont offer it to sell.
1,cheap bag,"I brought this last year, I went to Wildwood, NJ with my cousin, and I took this to the beach to carry my flip flops and a very small towel, and before I got to the broad walk towards the beach the handle broke. Get a better bag."
2,okay,it is no doubt cute.. idk how stavle it will be since i have not used it to go to the pool yet. but it is not as big as i thought it would be. kinda disapointed
4,Just what the daughter ordered,"My daughter was looking for a colorful tote that wasn't too small and wasn't too big. I found this one on Amazon.com and my daughter loved the picture. We went ahead and ordered it and she has been very happy with her choice. It is a nice medium size tote. It won't hold everything in her room, but it holds just what she needs easily. It is very well made. We will definitely do business with Nvie Designs again."
4,Geppetto: A Musical Delight,"Stephen Schwartz has once again taken a familiar story and breathed into it new life with his beautiful and highly entertaining score. This PINOCCHIO story has most of the familiar elements made famous by Walt Disney, but with catchy tunes, grand orchestrations and delightful characters, this version, centered around Geppetto's character, is a wonder all its own. A perfect CD to pop into the car player for a family trip! After listening just a few times, your entire family will be singing along!"
4,Great information - could be better organized,"The information presented in the book is solid, with great detail provided about each of the campsites. We look forward to seeing many of them. The book could be better organized though. In order to find a particular site, you need to follow a 3-4 step process through maps and keys. This shouldn't keep anyone from buying the book, but we hope the next edition is a bit easier to digest."
1,Not an Accurate Title,"It is true what other people said about how the book is organized, but more that true, I feel the book is such a mess.I'm a world traveler camper and this is the worst book about tent camping you could ever find. Watson gives descriptions about the places to camp away from RV's and noise and everything but everything is a lie. We have camped in about 40% of the places he said and in every place I find: RV's, loud music, showers, toilets, food vendors, ELECTRICITY!!!!; it is just sad. If you are planning to do real camping with a little help of your car or motorcycle find another book, this one is just completely inaccurate and far of to what real camping is suppose to be..."
5,Quality as Always,"I have used RCBS Reloading dies in the past and have always been please with the results.This set was no diffrent, Great quality Great performance Easy setup and the LIFETIME warranty.Buy these and you will never need another set."
1,WOW!!! Amazon Needs to Remove This!,"Geee... wow, Amazon has this on their site for sale? I'm going back to Amazon to get my money back. This is nothing more than a sales arcticle. It doesn't teach you anything. Wow. I can not believe I just paid for it. It's an advertisment from a magazine, nothing more. If ever I felt that Amazon just ripped me off, it would be right now."
3,I feel like the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz,"This is a nice, lightweight hat and looks cute in the photo, but the wide rim flops into your face and is not glamorous at all, in my opinion. It needs something to hold it up, or to make it a little stiffer if it is going to have a rim that wide. At least it was advertised as a floppy hat! The delivery was very fast and efficient."
5,Help for Moms who feel lost and frustrated,"This book was wonderful ! The short chapters are easy to read for us busy-Mom's. The book made me feel like I'm not alone in raising a difficult child. The book was filled with real stories from the author. I recognized myself and my son in the everyday problems. Also, the author offers practical suggestions and short prayers to help ! The book recognizes the difficult parts of parenting an ADHD child, and at the same time offers hope & encouragement ! I'm going to read it again and I won't lend this book out (since it's invaluable to me). I wish she wrote a book on parenting teenagers ;)"
4,great phone,"I bought this phone when my Samsung schA670 broke in half.Best features in my opinion:Clear, easy to read display.No antenna to worry about.Great reception.It doesn't seem to have as many ringtones as my old phone, but I've downloaded alot and the sound quality on them is great. The camera is much better than the 670, and the phone itself seems more durable. The front display is also bigger. Battery life seems ok, but I did also buy an extended life battery so I alternate between the two. I've only had the phone for about 2 months but overall I love it!"
3,"HORRIBLE speakerphone, otherwise OK","Used on Verizon network.PROS- physically sturdy- aesthetically pleasing- voice dial software works well- colorful and vivid screen- good camera qualityCONS- worst speakerphone I've ever used. I drive alot and choose to use the speakerphone over a headset. speakerphone echos, if you have the volume on high (so you can hear it), it gets muffled and unclear so you need to use it on low volume to hear and understand the person on the other side- on calls using the phone itself, i heard a high pitch sound off and on- calls seemed to drop more often than i was used to (even more than the razr i tried on the verizon network)PS - i ended up getting the LG ""V"" 9800 much better speakerphone and overall voice quality than the samsung"
3,"Features, BUT...","A nice phone with loads of features, but Verizon has once again decided to disable some useful features to force the customer to pay more. You must buy a cable and a memory card to use the mp3 player effectively, and it only supports windows wma format. You must use WindowsXP and windows mediaplayer 10 to convert mp3's, and you must have the usb cable to transfer these to the phone.Bluetooth is disabled except for a mono earpiece. No calendar/phonebook synch with computers.You cannot transfer images/videos to computer. You must pay to mail them, and even then, only in lower quality due to image size restrictions.Nice phone, but verizon messed it up.I sent in my rebate before thorough testing, or it would have gone back."
2,don't buy this phone from verizon!!,this a good phone for those who are interested in listening to music. also a bluetooth and java/brew provide ability to download new applications. however the verizon blocks download of free ring tones and java games/applications from the internet ( you have to pay verizon for every game) thus severely limitng the usefullness of the phone.boycott verizon!!!
2,Poor speaker and bad default ringtones,"Pros:- No antenna sticking out- Plays MP3s- Supports full volume ring with vibrateCons:- Audio quality is bad. Mine had an annoying popping sound when the person on the other end spoke. They sounded like they had the hiccups. Replaced the phone with an identical phone and the problem remains but is better.- Reception level is always lower than my old phone that was also on the Verizon network- Default ringtones are horrible. I just want the phone to ring like a phone when I get a call!- Cannot use uploaded MP3s as a ringtone. Obviously this (combined with the bad defaults) is a limitation imposed to force you to buy a decent ringtone.- Headphone jack is not the default headphone jack but something a little smaller.- Bad video and picture quality, but I guess all phones are like that. I don't really want these features anyway."
1,Crippled Phone so Verizon can upsell services,"This phone has had most of its functionality disabled so you have to buy additional services from verizon so they can make more money.1) You can't use a USB cable to synchronize contacts with Outlook. You can however use verizon's $19.99 wireless sync service to do this.2) This phone only has embarrassingly unprofessional ring tones on it. AND you can't upload your own for free--you have to BUY them from verizon.3) All of the Bluetooth capability is disabled except for handsfree--you can't transfer data and you can't control your phone from your PDA or PCThis doesn't appear to be Samsung's doing because after talking with the verizon people it appears that they are crippling all of their phones to try to force people to spend more $$$. Well, I guess I get to go back to T-mobile."
3,I like the black pictures it takes,"I don't really use the music, because verizon is a rip off.I use the camera, even when I'm not... and sometimes I end up with pictures of my pocket because I pressed a button somehow and it took some photos.I don't really have any other complaints, nor any positives, so it gets a three."
3,Somewhat Choppy Sound,"I've had this phone for a few months now. Verizon. On the plus side, it works with the Reliance Network in India with very good reception. Here in the US, the sound is usually somewhat choppy. I think I can live with it till the contract is up, and then I'll surely replace it. The leather cover, which also has a belt clip, wants to keep coming off."
1,worst phone,"this has to be the worst phone i have ever owned in my life!!! reception is horrible, speakerphone is constantly distant sounding, i keep hearing a high pitch noise like when you get your hearing tested whenever im on it, dropping calls like no tomorrow, where w/ prior phones through verizon i never have, all they say is keep updating the phone well guess what that dont work!!!! do not waste a cent for this piece of junk. all you will want to do is through it through a window!!! trust me!!! didnt even have it close to a yr now i have to shell out way more money to actually be able to have a phone again, and dont ever do a 2yr to get stuck w/ garbage!..."
4,exelente aparato pero baja señal,"compre este aparato hace mas de un mes y en realidad tiene de todo, podemos grabar nuestar propia musica y nuestros ringtones (timbres)en la micro sandisk, ahora eso si tenemos que tener pendiente que la musica debe ser grabada en formato WMA para poder tocarlas y los ringtones deben ser grabados en formato MID para poder tocarlos y para eso de grabar los tonos y musica si debes tener un card rider/writer que debe costar unos 30 dollares para poder descargar en la tarjeta microsd toda la musica que quieras,y tambien las fotos que tengas en la pc o las que tomes con el telefono pasarla a la pc.La camara del telefono es muy buena tanto la de video como la fotografica, lo unico malo que encontre en este telefono es la señal siempre es mas baja que mi antiguo cellular por lo demas esta super chulo como decimos en Rep. Dominicana"
2,Eh.,"I am not happy with these boots. The inside, where the zipper is, bunches up at the ankle and no amount of pulling and straightening can make it look good. They are comfortable as far as the heel, but I am not pleased with the rest."
4,"Good boots, great price.","I've been looking for some nice, non-leather dress boots for a long time, but have always been disappointed with either the quality of the material or the exorbitant price of vegan footwear. These boots are a very nice compromise! While they probably won't ever be confused with real leather, they are attractive and don't look super cheap like other non-leather boots I've seen. They're well-made, with good grip on the tread, and are surprisingly comfortable. I'm a pretty reliable size 8, and when I first tried them on I considered ordering up a half size since they fit a little snug at the top of the foot, but it wasn't too bad, and they actually settled in after a couple weeks. They are pretty much a perfect fit now. I have average size calves and they shaft is not too loose or too tight. Overall, very happy with this purchase and you cannot beat the price!"
4,"Great fit, great value",This boot is comfortable yet the design is sleek and not bulky. I wore them all-day at work for the first time and it was as if I'd worn them for ages. I'm tempted to buy another pair in black.
4,Very very comfy,The most comfortable pair of boots I've walked in so far! Walked around in them for hours. Only thing is the ankle area is a bit narrow. and slouch a bit. but still the soles are very comfy. And worth it for the price.
2,Boots,"I think the boots i received were just fine. BUT they were not the Lasticity Pull On Boot. They were the Lasticity Boot with a zipper. I didn't have neither the time nor the patience to return them so I kept them. They are not what i wanted, but are a solid boot and work just fine for those of us with bigger calves."
3,"Comfortable, good looking.","These boots have a very comfortable heel. I was looking for something nice looking that I could wear in the winter without too much fear of falling on my face due to ice, and the rubber soles on these help a lot. They fit tightly from the ankles upward, so if you have very muscular calves you might have an issue with this. There isn't a lot of give.Also, a weird note about these - I found a small, loose screw in the Amazon box, which at first I thought was just an anomaly. However, after I put on one of the boots, there was a second, identical screw partially jammed underneath the inner shoe lining. Ouch. Look out for that."
3,They'll do,"Pros-- Attractive from a distance-- Affordable-- Toe bed is comfortable-- Side zippers can take some abuse-- They stretch to accomodate a wide width calfCons-- Seriously cheap-looking up close. The pleather looks cheap. No way around it.-- Construction is spotty. These are a few seasons old and the glue that holds the shoe together seems to be going in some shoes. I had to order two pairs and I sent one back.-- These boots hurt my knees and heels after a few days. I can only wear them one day a week.Having said all this, I have not thrown these boots away because I can't find anything better in this price range. I wish I could throw them out."
2,Not as good as expected...,Decent fit and overall look but the non leather is an issue. Painfully obvious these boots are fake leather and so a bit too plastic looking.
1,Terrible,"This book is absolutely terrible. I bought it as the only book I took with me to France, and it did not come in handy even one time. It does not have even basic vocabulary in it (like words on menus and other useful words). All it has is outdated phrases. I wish I had not wasted luggage space on this book, small as it is."
4,FLOWER HOUSE,"After reading reviews I expected a so-so product. The braces do fit tight and it takes two people to install them. Other than that it was easy assembly. One of the cross brace ties was not installed.Pros- InexpensiveCons - it is a skimpy 5 ft heights, if you must have 5 ft, get the six footer."
3,For now,Kind of too early to be rating yet on keeping plants alive but it is the size needed for now. Will know after winter is over if the quality is good and if it does not rip at seams.
4,Top and Side rods,Top and side rods were too long . The rods bowed and could not be attached with the straps that they were meant to.Other than that everyting was just great.
5,Just the right size,I have a bigger one of these that we always put up for wintering my potted plants. It took up almost all of my lower patio. This smaller one takes up much less space and all the plants fit. It does exactly what is is supposed to--keeps the plants from freezing when temps get below 32 degrees. It's easy to put up and take down and store till next year.
1,Didn't hold up,"Really liked the design and was very excited when I got the product. Always had some issue with the door zipper not working smoothly from the start but overlooked because I needed the greenhouse for winter. However, having used it for 12 months now, there are serious issues with the outer zipper door sticking because it is wrinkled up in the opening, the sewed part is actually lumpy and causes it to grab. On the interior screen door, the net material is already deteriorated to the point you can stick your finger through it when you put a very slight pressure on the fabric. Maybe I got a lemon, but can't recommend it from what I have experienced."
4,"Light, easy to assemble, good ventilation","My use of these greenhouses was unconventional. I ordered 3 of these greenhouses to house moths and the plants they lay their eggs upon. The moths suffered a little in these cages -- I think the humidity was too low -- but the plants grew nicely. I was pleased with how easy it was to assemble the cages, and how sturdy they were given their lightweight construction. I think they would serve very well as a cheap alternative to a more permanent greenhouse. Just make sure they are properly staked down, as they are very lightweight."
4,No directions,"There were absolutely no directions to putting this thing together, and I have now 4 strings that I have no idea what they're for. I did finally get this thing together. I'm not using this as a greenhouse though- I'm using it for a duck shelter within the pen they're in. Currently, they don't want to use it. Maybe as it gets cooler and windy out."
4,Need setup instructions please.,"Could someone explain how to setup this greenhouse? There are 4 poles I don't know where they go, and the small one wich is supposed to go on the roof, is larger than expected."
2,It did not work for me!,"I am not sure why I am rating this product as 2 stars and not 1. Perhaps I am giving it the benefit of my inexperience with plants and greenhouses. But its been a week, and so far it has only killed my plants. Some out of heat (because it gets infinitely super-humid during the day inside it) and some out of cold (because the temperatures drop drastically at night and it doesn't really help). I would mention that I am in Connecticut (Harsh winters? Of course, don't we love them!), and I am a very new gardener. I thought I might be able to over-winter some of my shrubs in this greenhouse, on my patio. But so far, marigolds are dead in 2 nights, my tropical croton's leaves drooped like their spines broke in just 1 night out, and mums too have started looking awful!! May be I don't know how to use it, I can't answer that, but it did not work for me and I am very sad for my beautiful little croton plant which I am trying to revive desperately now. :("
3,portable greenhouse,I will start to use it for this winter and after that I will know for sure how it is doing. For now I don't have any comments.
4,TNA Against All Odds 2005 review,"The NWA World heavyweight championship match between Jeff Jarrett & Kevin Nash while not a great bout it was still a entertaining and decent brawl and could have done alot better without the cello(don't ask). The 30 minute Ironman match X-Division championship between A.J. Styles & Christopher Daniels was hard-hitting,solid & met expectations. The Full Metal Mayhem match between Jeff Hardy & Abyss was a good reminder of Hardy's TLC matches in the WWE. The rest were OK. I give this event a 7 out of 10."
5,this is real wrestling,1st match primetime vs petey wiliams winner primetime. 2nd match bg james and jeff hammond vs matt bently and kaz winners bg james and jeff hammond. 3rd match raven vs dustin rhodes winner raven. 4th match amw vs kid kash and lance hoyt winners amw. 5th match jeff hardy vs abyss winner abyss. 6th match ddp and monty brown vs team canada winners ddp and monty brown. 7th match aj styles vs christopher daniels winner aj styles. 8th match jeff jarett vs kevin nash winner jeff jarett. bonus footage team trinty vs lex lovett and buck quantine team traci vs mickey batts and jerelle clark winners team traci.
3,TNA's worst p.p.v so far!,"Ok this is TNA's worst p.p.v yet.I had got this dvd adding to my collection of my other TNA dvds including Best of A.J Styles Phenomenal,Best of the X division,Final Resolution,and Destination X but this dvd was the worst Ive seen yet.Theres only a couple good matches like;Jeff Hardy vs Abyss in Full Metal Mayhem,AJ Styles vs the Fallen Angel Christopher Daniels in an 30 minute iron man match for the X division title,and the main event with Big Sexy Kevin Nash vs Jeff Jarrett which saw the debut of Kip James(Billy Gunn from the WWE)and the return of Sean Waltman(XPac).If I were you I would rather get the Destination X ppv which was better or Final Resolution but if youre a collerctor like me then I would go ahead and get it before it is maybe too late."
1,Flower?,"I'd buy this sneaker if it weren't for that flower on the side. A dark green shamrock on the side instead of that flower would be entirely better, considering it's called Celtic green--for crying out loud!"
5,Not bad...,"I bought this book expecting it to cover a much wider area of connectivity.It focuses on X.400 and particulary SMTP connectivity, not what I really wanted. But it does cover those areas really well.As well, as just looking at Exchange, the author covers more related technology areas. Good information from the real world."
5,Great book. Lots of information. Easy to read!,"I bought this book based on my experience that the Digital Press series offers the best books on email in the industry. Kieran McCorry meets that challenge! His writing easily matches that of Redmond, Rhoton, Collin, Avolio and Vixie."
1,Repetitive and tries to over-complicate the subject,"I found the content repetitive and the points laboured. The information provided could have been easily presented in 10 pages. Instead the author attemps to over-complicate the topic and confuse the reader. I'm not sure who he is trying to impress, but he didn't impress this reader. E-mail connectivity is an important technology. Getting it right can be the difference between a low maintenance, efficient, fast infrastructure and a painfully slow, troublesome and unreliable one. Unfortunatly this book only succeeds in clouding the issues involved."
3,I feel cheated,"Okay, first off, let me say that I adore this series and the auhtor. Which is why I was so excited by another book being issued.The problem is, this book is not really part of the For Better of For Worse series. Sure, it is the same author and there are a few characters that are in it, but overall this is more a look at grandafthers and their grandchildren - comic style.Also, the book is tiny. About 20 to 30 pages and measures about 5 inches X 5 inches. The cost is around $9.95US (even more in Canada which is where I bought it).Each page has one tiny little comic with a few sentences. Mind you - not a comic strip on each page - just one image.Anyway, I feel extremely cheated by this book."
1,too small,"If I had know that this was a small book with only 22 pages and not about the For Better or For Worse family I would not have bought it , not worth the $8.95"
2,"The ""grandpa"" seems nice enough of a man.","He's a decent, long-suffering daddy of three bickering kids who has developed a slight paunch (as well as obsession with toy trains) and chased after young skirts even in front of his aging wife.Too bad he's now a grandfather to a blond-curled maternal fantasy with the face of a beauty queen (she's gonna win countless child beauty pageants and eventually become an overconfident leader of the giggliest and cattiest high school clique in whole history) and a miniature clone of the good-looking young father, complete with wavy chestnut hair and a dimpled, chiseled chin.At least the comic strip is semi-retired, so we won't have to see the latest additions grow up to be such impossible creatures one day."
2,Lacks explanation,"This book appears to be useful, but in reality, it isn't. The formulas are given without stating their inherent assumptions and limitations. Somewhere in the book the author states: ""for an overconsolidated clay, cohesion is greater than zero; for a normally consolidated clay, it is zero."" No further explanation.This is a ""cookbook"" type of text, perfectly suited for today's mediocrity infested mentality: grind thru a formula and produce some numbers, fast. To that end, it's a great book. My sincere recommendation to the author: double the size of the book, and turn it into an insightful, meaningful, useful book."
3,Overpriced for its contents,"This book is okay at best. There are not a lot of examples on how to work problems in the book. I had to refer to other text to understand what the author was saying. Also the price is way too high. I know students do not have much say in textbook selection, but as an instructor I would look elsewhere before selecting this one."
1,Boring,The book is only a mix of equations whith no explanations. I rather prefer the classical soil mechanics books where the topic is better explained.
5,Careful Balance Of Current Research And Practical Field,"""..... this book maintains the CAREFUL BALANCE OF CURRENT RESEARCH AND PRACTICAL FIELD applications that has made it a leading text in foundation engineering courses throughout the country and internationally.....""[from the book of the back cover]"
4,a brief but thought-provoking read,"Maggie arranges for her and her two grown daughters to spend an uninterrupted week together at the beach, not realizing that they will want to spend all of their time on the phone and computer. Finally she is forced to tell the truth: she has cancer, and thinks that her time left is very limited. They try to spend the rest of the week enjoying and appreciating each other before it's too late. I recently heard Blackstock in a radio interview say that a novella can be read in one sittting, and you will certainly be able to do that with Seaside because you will want to know how it ends. Although I like Blackstock's mystery/thrillers better than Seaside, I did find this book very thought-provoking and enjoyed reading it."
1,"Disapointing, shallow, predictable",This book was disapointing in that it did not have the substance that her other books have. It wsas shallow and predictable. I whish that I had not spent the money.
2,Scenery,I am looking for waves where the swells are the focus and the scenery changes some. This DVD kept the same scene and it at an angle. It was not close and personally involving for me.
2,A little disappointed,"I really didn't feel that the quality of either the sound or the video was worth the purchase. The entire thing seemed quite amateurish to me. It's a wonderful idea, however."
4,Very nice watch,"I bought this watch as an everyday/work watch. It's very attractive and keeps good time. The only drawback with this watch is, that if you need links taken out (most people will), be prepared to pay a jeweler to do this. The screws in the band are almost invisible to the naked eye. I have a screwdriver set made for this, but could not get the screws out myself."
2,Indiglo failed after just a few months.,"This is a beautiful watch, but I buy Timex watches specifically for the indiglo feature. I have had many Timex watches over the years. This is the first time that the indiglo feature has stopped working. Had to return it."
4,good water glasses,"I bought these to go with my Riedel Vinum wine glasses because the Vinum water glass is just too small to be useful. These are just right for a water glass, nice big bowl and a short stem. They have the same cut edge as the Vinum glasses, and you really wouldn't know that they're not crystal by looking at these and the Vinum side-by-side. Note: the box they come in isn't very strong, and the glasses can break in shipping. Amazon replaced my broken glasses with no questions."
5,Excellent,"A multi-viewpoint view on the areas of assimilation, violence, and gender relations. Castillo masterfully wavers from the masculine narrator Max (whom she writes from both the first and third person, sometimes switching in the middle of the narration) and Pastora, the woman with whom he is infatuated and cannot obtain. She also mixes fantasy, memory, and dreams to create a work that will stay with the reader long after the final page is read."
2,Disjointed,"The first half of the novel is really interesting and a quick read. Then you get to the second half and it becomes disjointed and challenging to track exactly what is going on. This makes the novel frustrating as a whole. The ending is rather disappointing and anticlimactic, leaving much of the story unresolved, and the reader feeling like they just wasted their time."
3,Special Sorrows,"This book focuses on the immigration period around the turn of the last century. The first few chapters on how life in USA chronnicled the emigrants' views; that is, the reasons for emigration and the hope the US policy would support their dreams of creating (Jews) or reclaiming (Irish an Poles) a homeland. This part was somewhat tedious reading because it was too repetitive. The later chapters on the emigrants' reaction to the conflict in Cuba and the Phillipines were fascintating. It revealed the beginnings of empire building and sounded like current mideast policy."
5,Excellent !,I love this book ! Dr. Crane (Author) is teaching me this subject and I never thought learning about Robots would be as simple as this! Every chapter is placed where it should be. I think I'm going to keep this book with me for long as a reference book should I find work in a similar field!
4,Good Text for Robot Analysis,"The book is a good graduate level text (it may be a little too advanced for undergraduate study) in Robot linkage kinematics. The professor of the class at the University of Florida (Go Gators!) wrote this book. He is an entertaining and very straightforward instructor and stays on the ""big Picture"" view of things. This is also apparent in the book. Detailed analysis tools for the various classes of robot arms are included chapterwise."
2,This is not a kinematics book,"This book covers only geometric analysis. Differential relationships, which distinguish kinematics from geometry, are not covered. Much of the book covers the geometry of an array of closed loop spatial mechanisms. This is useful if that is what you're interested in, but does not apply to serial linkages."
1,Ummm....,"The front of the book clearly shows ""grilling"" and judging from the Book Description, I seriously doubt this book has anything to do with ""Barbecuing"" I think I will pass."
2,Close to the Vest,"I actually found this a bit too conservative of a performance for my tastes. It's technically all there, but there is no real emotion in the piece. These suites in live performance sing, leaping off the stage with emotion and power. Here, all that seems to have been sacrificed for correctness. As background music, it is fine, but look elsewhere if you want to experience the emotional power of these works."
4,On the Brothers Brooks CD,"In short, I like this CD, primarily because I am the artist!I would like to inform anyone it may concern that this particular CD of mine and my brother Gregg's has sold an estimated 220,000 copies world-wide since its release in late 1994.The problem, however, our original recording contract notwithstanding, is that even in light of the fact that I'm proud of these sales numbers and am all for easier access to music for the masses, I am and have been for thirty+ years a full-time musician and my brother and I have NEVER RECEIVED A RED PENNY FOR OUR CONTRACTED WORK ON THIS CD!!!... It's tough enough to make a living in this dog-eat-dog profession and it certainly doesn't help when those responsible for paying you seem to ""take a hike"" to parts unknown!Other than the above, enjoy the CD folks - it's not your fault!Tim Brooks"
2,Not what I was expecting,I needed the for a party in a few weeks. Was hesitant to order since shipping was pretty much more than the actual product. Sorry I did order them. The are very small! Too small for what I was planning on.
1,Dumb Design...,"Not a lot of thought put into the design:- Brush handle too short- It's round, so it rolls (should have octagonal or hexagonal shaped handle, at least a flat edge)- No loop, so it can NOT be hung up"
4,A good burner for a good price.,"Considering this was the cheapest one on the shelf, I didn't expect much, but I must say I was quite surprised. Installation was simple, within 10 minutes of cracking the case of my computer I was burning DVDs. The included Roxio software was a decent package covering most of the stuff you'd do with a DVD burner. Maybe not the best software package for power users, but for the average user it has everything they need. I'm very pleased with it."
2,Memorex duel format dvd,I purchased the product and installed the drive in my dell computer system (xp OPERATING SYSTEM). The hardware instalation was flawless.I installed the ROXIO software and attemted to play a dvd with the dvd player from ROXIO. Kept getting an error and was never able to play a dvd.Tried to duplicate a dvd that I had made on a phillips dvd recorderThe ROXIO program coppied 99 % and then came up with an error and could not continue.Since none of the software worked I took the product back to where I had purchased it.POOR SOFTWARE
1,"Really, This Is Bad...","I just have to give my 2 cents here. This game is awful. Buying something like this just encourages the production of more bad games. I don't find any fault with producing a movie based game, but the programmers/designers need to have some time to make a decent and playable video game.We've gotten to the point where any game based on a movie is EXPECTED to be bad just because this has become status quo.It doesn't have to be this way. Just stop buying this kind of crap and it will disappear. It may never be replaced, or it may be replaced by licensed tie-ins that actually have merit. Any option is better than this bullpoo."
5,A wonderful-OBJECTIVE book on the AIDs virus,"Very objectively written, it is chock full of info from start to finish(and a look to the future as well), history, symptoms Etc. A full 5 stars for his book!"
3,Drinking Coffee Elsewhere,"A collection of short stories that were, at times, hard to read due to their lack of that certain ""something"" that made me want to turn the page. The stories about the nurse, the runaway, and young protester were the better ones of the collection. It may be a worthy addition to your personal library, but count me as one who's glad it was borrowed from the library."
3,Well written but un-inspired,"I have just recently started to read story collections and picked this one up based on the numerous glowing reviews. The book was just okay. The stories were written in the first-person narrative and provided snapshots of a period of time in the lives of the African-American characters. Most of the stories were fairly stereo-typical and not at all inspired or original.The hype that surrounded this book is just that, hype. The stories were well written, just not that interesting."
3,Did Friends of the Author Write these?,"all these reviews sound like they were written by friends of the author (or maybe even the publists). They don't sound like real people. and even the one long one is a repeat, with just a name change, which slants the 4 star average. Anyway, I like short stories, and sometimes kill time by stopping by the library. I did pick up a copy of this book there to get a taste of it, and I found it too angry to finish. It's well written, but that's not enough for me, so I won't be buying a copy to finish it."
3,Ya gotta take the good fics with the bad fics. Or maybe not.,"I gotta agree with Gregory Baird. These fics are very much hit-and-miss. EVERY TONGUE is a brilliant exercise in empathy. The protagonist is a Christian-fundamentalist creep, but ZZ treated her with a certain amount of respect. Clareese gets redeemed thru another person. (Instead of merely thru Jesus.)"
2,it's missing something.,"Maybe I'm just too different from ZZ Packer to fully appreciate her book. But all the people in her stories are so different... and none of them really clicked (I kinda liked the little girl who ran away though).In fact, some of them seemed like unfair characterizations. The people weren't real - they're maybe what you'd guess someone like that might be like. Not well rounded enough to catch you and draw you in.Some of the stories were hard to get through, especially the first one. At least one of them didn't seem to have a point (although that's typical of short story collections).But again, I want to say.. maybe it's because I'm not enough like her. Maybe I can't fill in the blanks the way that someone who is like her can. Maybe you have to have some of these experiences in order figure these people out.If you're intrigued by the types of charcters she writes about, I'd encourage you to give it a try. I wouldn't, however, recommend it as the place to start if you are not."
1,drinking coffee elsewhere,"I finally had the chance to read a book by ZZ Packer...I was really looking forward to her book..I am a lover of books..I try to give new authors a chance before I give an opinion of their writings..But I was highly disappointed in ""Drinking Coffee Elsewhere..There were too many grammatical errors in this book..Books are edited before print,so I thought..I believe if a seasoned author took Packer under their guidance, it would help Packer with developing her writing.. In this book Packer would end a paragragh with one thought and start the next paragraph with a different thought that did not connect with the previous thought.... Today the temperature is in the three digits and I thought I would read this book on my Kindle....But I could not finish the book..what a waste of money ...But I can say she had good story ideas....Keep writing, but have your work edited....."
3,"Love the writing, not the stories","ZZ Packer is a wonderful writer. Her style and prose are effortless. She allows you to use all of your senses - you can see the characters, feel the weather, and smell the food. However, I did not like all of the stories in this collection; in fact, I would only recommend 3 or 4. Most left me with an incomplete feeling. Many of her characters are unlikable, unsympathetic. Because her writing is so vivd, I felt I was left hanging at the end of the title story, Geese, and others.I will eagerly await Ms. Packer's next effort, though. She is too good of a writer not to succeed."
2,This collection left me unmoved,"After reading the other reviews, I guess that tells you more about me than it does about ZZ packer. But I just could not care about any of the people in these stories.The scary part was to think about the education system of Yale, Johns Hopkins, Iowa Writers and other institutional names that were dropped on the jacket blurbs, but no one cared enough to distinguish between Acrostic and acronym or mnemonic, near the bottom of page two."
1,overrated,"not that great. packer is not a great writer, she just nailed down a few details in the story to make it plausible but it has no real feeling, as in -- whatever ""drinking coffee elsewhere"" is supposed to mean -- it comes off as lame and sophmorish and only seems to hint at something she doesn't have the linguistic command to fully evoke. skip it for Kate Braverman or Darcy Stienke."
1,Regretful,I tried so hard to read this book. I really did. I trudged through several chapters and then gave up and donated it to my local coffee shop library.
3,Left me hanging...,"I'd heard so much about this author, even read an excerpt of ""Brownies"". Packer is an excellent writer but the characters in these stories are not very well developed and the endings were soft. Each story drew me in but once there I lost interest in the characters because there wasn't enough to hold onto. I kept thinking as I read the stories that I would love to see how this writer develops over the next ten-twenty years. I see great things for her future work. This one didn't quite do it for me.Taxes, Death & Trouble author CM Miller"
3,Pretty good!,"Pretty good, not what I expected but it works. Due to the fact that I have braces, this is not something that I would use everyday, but on the go it is a neat little tool."
3,It's OK,"This was a throw in when I bought my Waterpik. It's OK, but if you have a waterpik, you shouldn't need it."
5,Works Great,"I really like this product, gets down at the gum line and fits between teeth. It was recommended by my son's orthodontist."
2,Water? Not.,Am disappointed because I thought it was a little water pick...hence the name. I feel somewhat mislead. So I gave it away. Hope the new recipient likes it!...?
2,hard to use,"The picks bend very easily, and the angle of the device makes it very hard to reach back teeth. Too bad, it's a good idea."
1,Water Pik Flosser Replacement Tips,"I've used the Water Pik Flosser for many years. My recent purchase of replacement tips has been less than satisfactory. They have changed, have become flimsy and one does not last through one flossing! I am not happy with these at all."
2,Only one size for a floss head.,"This Item may be good for stimulating the gums, but It's main purpose as a floss replacer. Ludacrous.It too big to ever get under the gum line to do any good where It counts the most. ALL the other extra heads that come with It In the picture, are all the same size replacements. All one size. I'd catoragize It as a gadget. I guess nothing can replace floss Itself. Not yet."
1,useless,A totally useless product which doesn't work for anything . Especially annoying because the name Waterpic lead me to believe that it would be worth buying.
1,A Waste of time and money,"The tips supplied with this device are so flimsy they don't make it through a single flossing.Maybe it has something to do with the ""Made in China"" label. Like another reviewer said ""It does not rate even one star"". Too late I learned that it could not be returned once it was opened. How else can you judge a product without opening it and using it. Bad Amazon policy! Amazon should stand behind the products they sell 100%. WDM."
2,Stick with regular floss.,"I have braces and hate threading floss, so I saw this and thought it was a good, easy alternative. WRONG, it sucks and opens up gaps between your teeth, and doesnt leave you feeling clean and minty fresh like floss. Save your six dollars and buy yourself some fancy floss."
5,good power flosser,It works real well and is a good deal for the price. No need for a toothpick ever again.
3,"pretty good, needs better pick","It took a lttle getting used to. but got better.My main problem is the pick, its too flimsy. Trying to insert between my teeth, it bent, and ruined the pick.Not giving up, I cut about a quarter of an inch off and now it works great.I wrote the company and told them about the flimsy pick They replied they would pass the information on to their R&D; department.If they improve it it will be a better unit, if not, look for another brand"
2,It is too small and cannot clean clearly,"The power is not enough, so it is not a good choice to replace the flosser. It is not worth the price."
3,I love this.... BUT,"I have been using these for years. The dentist is always amazed that I don't have any plaque.BUT... when the battery gets low, you might as well throw the thing in the trash. It is impossible to change the battery and if anyone has ever done it, I would love to know what is the secret. You can take it apart (almost), but you can never put it back together.So... my remedy is to just buy about 4 of them at a time and they will last for aboiut 7 months. Love it though."
1,waterpik flosser,Not what I was expecting...it doesn't work at all for its intended purpose. I thought the inserts would be little brushes that would really do the job instead they are smooth and don't do much of anything.
2,"Not good for your gums or ""tight"" teeth","Bought one for each member of the family, including my daughter with braces. All 3 of us got bloody gums trying to use this product. I still use mine, but have to be very careful. So many other flossing products are so much better and don't cause gum problems."
1,Un happy,Asked for the directors cut but was sent a normal copie ... Wish they would get it rite since its what I paid for
2,Not cool....,"As a fan of the horror/exploitation genre, I saw ""Last House on the Left"". As disturbing as that movie is it does offer the revenge and retribution angle at the end which offers some solace to the audience. Also, it wasn't quite as sickenly graphic in its depictions of brutal violence. ""Choas"" even felt the need to subsitute the very effective rape scene in ""Last House on the Left"" with a truely puke worthy rape of a corpse scene.On a positive note, the acting isn't bad. The victims are effective and the bad guys are believable. Its the changes to the script that are what ruins this movie. If it was a straight remake it may well have worked with this cast..Where ""Last House on the Left"" left the viewer wanting to take a long shower, ""Choas"" leaves the viewer wanting to take a bath with a razor blade. Alas, this movie will not make it into my DVD collection."
1,...watch out - even the cover is a fake!!!!,"roger ebert never said this in that kind of context. he gave the movie ""no stars"". that says it all. even the cover is a fake. save your bucks... falco go home!!!! we don't need trash like that!!!"
1,A Horrible Mess,"This movie was a complete rip off of Wes Craven's, Last House on the Left. I'm sure you already know this but I just thought I emphasize it to anyone who is thinking of buying this movie. I'll admit, I love gore and that's why I decided to buy this movie but this movie only had two ""gore"" scenes that we poorly scripted and as well as acted. In fact, the whole movie had corny dialogue, ammeter actors, and on top of that a stupid ending. I like movies with a cliffhanger or even bad endings but movies that just cut you off with no hope of anything good or bad (like this movie had) is what grinds my gears. I absolutely regret purchasing this movie and wish I could get my money back. I actually wound up throwing it in the trash. If you want a good movie, you will not find it here."
2,A Rated R Last House On The Left,"This flick is supposed to be a *cautionary tale*. In this case, the cautionary tale is something like - don't get involved with dirty strangers cause they may cut off parts of your anatomy and force you to eat it. If it wasnt so low budget, it might have been OK for a gore flick. But when he supposedly cut off the nipple..you could see it was fake blood and that booby was bigger than the other one(hidden nipple and top of breast). What a snore!I love horror movies and am not offended by violence, as a matter of fact, I love the Saw series, but this was garbage. And if DeFalco thought the ending was ""realistic"", then he's a bigger idiot than I thought.This film has no character development no advancement and no real lesson to learn except the one they have to blatantly tell you at the beginning of the movie.This flick belongs on television(basic cable) at 3 am"
2,CHECK OUT MAYA BAROVICH IN...,"One of the girls who plays a victim in this film also showed up in the first season of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment as the girl he played a dating game joke on. That segment on the first season is hilarious and a little scary in parts. Much scarier than anything in this film.As for this film, yes, it's a copy of a much better film but instead of railing against it, just ignore it. There are worse films out there and the more attention films like this and Hostel get, the more we'll see of them. I'm tired of filmmakers trying to outdo and outgross one another in the torture department. I'd like a good story too."
4,Illustrations capture baby's attention,"My one-year old reaches for this book again and again. She appears to enjoy the rhyming verse and the pictures, intently studying them each time and smiling! Hey, she's never used a bottle either (i.e., ""these are the things a baby needs: bottle, blanket, rattle, beads), but what's the harm in learning a new word? This is a sweet book."
5,great book,Great book but very intense.I am not finished yet because I can only manage a few pages at a time.I relate on a deep level to the content and it can be emotionally exhausting discovering so many new things about myself.The book is written very well and has brought in some revolutionary ideas about PTSD.
5,Excellent resource for clinicians and trauma survivors,"As a therapist who works with many trauma survivors, I believe this book should be required reading for every clinician. Survivors will be able to feel validated in their suffering, understand why talking alone has not helped, and access clear ways to move past their symptoms."
3,captivates our toddler but not Alison Court (original Loonette),"One of the few shows that my 20 month old will sit and watch for 10 minutes withough making a peep. He loves the Loonette and Molly parts, but hates the dust bunnies and the reading part. Sings and dances along with the music. One thing that needs to be mentioned is that although this is listed as the original Loonette(Alison Court) it is not it's Ramona Gilmore Darling, who is not nearly as good as Court."
3,NOT ALYSON COURT!!!!!!!,"Bought this for my 15 month old who loves the show. Amazon said this had Alyson Court in it (the original loonette!) but she's not in this one!! It is the second girl, and for whatever reason it makes a difference! My daughter still watches it."
4,Yet another wonderful Nora Roberts trilogy,"This trilogy is typical in that each book can stand on its own but the books of this trilogy are very much tied to each other. If you like supernatural mystery/romances, then this trilogy is for you. The characters are well described so you can picture them as you are reading. I recommend getting all three at the same time if possible as they will be quickly read! The main characters are strong women who come into their own together. As with other 'series' type books, it's best to read them in order. If you can't, at least read the third one last."
4,Avid Reader,"As with her other trilogies, I recommend that you read these novels in the order they were written. While I believe the Circle trilogy is better, I enjoyed the Key trilogy also. Book 2, Key of Knowledge, was the least enjoyable and most predictable. The characters, while not thoroughly developed, were likeable enough and I wanted each to complete their task. If you have read the Circle Trilogy, then this is a decent read. If not, I recommend it over the Key Trilogy."
4,Key Trilogy,"This set of books arrived promptly and considering the publishing date, they were in good condition. I have read them and passed them on to a friend."
5,Fun reading!,"I am only into the second book of the set but I know that I will enjoy the entire set. It has been really fun reading, hard to put down. I am really enjoying the characters and the story line. Mortals handed a challenge by a couple of Gods? A great escape from the day to day routine of life. Love it!"
4,"More magic , mystery and men! Bravo!!",I love a good book series that keeps you up till well past bedtime on a work night! If you like mildly erotic mysteries with no desire to pull anything meaningful from a book - this is the series for you!! Purely endulgent reading with unreal hunks and heroins - send the kids to a sitter and your husband to the bar. Sit back in the tub with a glass of wine and enjoy!
5,Surprisingly Good Read,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of magic with my romances so I was hesitant to start reading this trilogy. My mom insisted I try this. I'm glad she did!The character development was great and I was really drawn to the storyline. I read all three books in two days. I couldn't put them down!"
4,All 3 are good,I have read Nora Roberts trilogies and sometimes you get that 2 are goos and one is not interesting or maybe 1 is good and the others not so good. But this one I enjoyed all three.
1,CAUTION! Won't take it back if it does not fit,"I purchased one of cover king's covers for a different brand car and it did not even come close to fitting and because it was a ""custom"" cover, they would not take it back or make it right. So I have an expensive dust collector in the garage right now. Just a caution to anyone considering a custom cover from cover king purchased through auto barn. I'll never do business with either company again, for any reason."
3,nice earrings but clasp is cheap,"These are a nice size and they haven't tarnished yet (after about 3 months). However, the clasp mechanism frequently pops open. At times the earring has fallen out of my ear!"
1,Awful telescope,"This is one of the worst telescopes i ever owned.The instructions are extremely confusing, and the mount shakes in the smallest breeze. The finderscope barely works, and it comes with two cheap, plastic eyepieces and mediorce optics. I would reccommend getting a six inch dobsonian telescope from celestron or orion instead of this christmas trash scope"
2,Not so good,The tank looks good on the picture but not so good when you actually receive it. I don't like it that much!
5,A Management Must-Have,"This is a book of profound proportions. Matteson and Ivancevich originally printed their first version of this book titled simply Management Classics with Goodyear publishing way back in 1980. Trust me for the money you will not find a better compilation of management and organization thought anywhere. This is a well researched and edited selection of management articles from the enormous names of the 20th century: McGregor, Parker, Bernard, et. al. If you are a business professor, a biz student, or a businessperson who truly wants to approach management in a scholarly and logical manner, then do yourself and your bookshelf a favor and buy it."
3,Delivery guy screwed up,...Amazon's site screwed up and didn't tell me if I had completed a transaction. I ordered again and discovered that I then had two orders. I wanted to recieve the book from this company. The delivery man didn't bother to look at the order number that I wanted to decline and the one I wanted to accept. Neither book appeared. I had to re-order....
3,Enjoyable,"I bought this book for my 3 year old, but I think it's a bit too complicated for her. The story is lovely, and I bought this based on our enjoyment together of several other books illustrated and/or written by Ms. Lin. However, her attention span at 3 is too short to get through all of the narrative, so we just looked at the pictures while I summarized. The pictures, as usual, were colorful and intriguing, but we put this book aside for next Summer, when she'll be closer to 4, and we can read it together as we plan our own ""ugly"" vegetable garden."
5,Great story about a child learning to appreciate her family,"A child feels awkward about her family's different customs but comes to appreciate, along with the neighbors, her mother's Chinese vegetable garden and delicious soup.As recommended on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children (www.books-for-children.com)"
5,The Ugly Vegetables,"One of my two year olds favorite books. Beautiful illustrations and a fun story, especially if coming from a gardening background. My daughter also loves trying to say the Chinese words for the vegetables at the end of the book."
1,"Awful tops, won't stay on, spill on table","I had high hopes for these bottles, but I was let down from the first minute. I screwed the cap on and tested them with some water, cap fell off and the water poured all over the place. The issue being the threading on the plastic caps is very loose, one thicker ring and a very loose fitting.They may be okay for storing things, but flip it upside down and squirt and you've got a mess. I thought I got a defective one and tried another with the exact same result. My goal was to hold simple syrup in them for cocktails but the syrup dumps out into the measuring glass as the top falls off.Awful product, not even worth the shipping costs."
1,Cold only,"I was so disappointed in this product. They work ok for dispensing thicker, cold or room temperature products, but are terrible on thin products like oils and impossible to microwave in. The bottles get too hot to handle, even with a rag, after just a short time, and long before the ingredients are melted and then begins to melt and list to the side. The seal leaks oil and the cap is easily lost or misplaced."
4,"Works well, price is right.","It's little, it's cheap and it serves it's purpose. There's nothing special over the Wilton brand and any other brand, except that I'm becoming increasingd loyal to Wilton as I try more and more of their products. Purchase these 2 for $2 at Walmart."
2,Standard,"The tops are not very secure, so there's a small window between too liquidy and too thick for these to be useful for my needs."
1,DO NOT USE TO MELT CANDY,These bottles are awful to melt candy. You can't microwave them so you have to heat the bottles in warm water (but not too hot or you'll melt the plastic). I ended up heating the chocolate candies in the microwave then putting them in an icing bag to decorate. Very dissapointing.
2,Don't lose the top,"The bottle works fine, once you are able to screw on the not terribly smooth screw top. The only real problem is that the closure is a small plastic tip. I could imagine it falling and disappearing forever. Other bottles of this sort have a closure connect to the bottle itself."
1,These ruined my whole night.,I purchased these bottles along with the bigger size bottle. I purchased I think close to 8 bottles and now I am down to 2 after one week of use. After multiple times of use a hole appears somewhere towards the bottom of the bottle. Also a whole will sometimes form on the side of the tip so when you squeeze the bottle you get chocolate out on the side of the tip and the bottom of the tip. I have tossed out so much chocolate and bottles and might as well say money because that is where that went too. Plus you are supposed to take the caps off when you put these in the microwave to melt your chocolate; but when you go to reheat the chocolate you are stuck with the hard chocolate in the cap that blocks the newly melted chocolate from coming out. These bottles are so frustrating.They may be $3.00 or so a piece; but I should not be this frustrated. Do not waste your money.
3,They served my purpose,"I agree with other posters that they are quite flimsy, so that the top can come off if using them as squeeze bottles form decoration. I cut a larger hole in the tube, and was using something not too thick, so they did serve the purpose, and they are cheap."
1,Thin plastic,"If you put warm, melted chocolate in these to decorate sweets, it melts and cracks the plastic. I ended up having to throw them away during their first use, with the chocolate. A complete waste!"
3,have a tendancy to leak,The lids don't seal as well as I expected. If you squeeze to hard the liquid in the bottle leaks out from the lid. It gets all over your hands and the outside of the bottle. The bottles are fine once you figure out how hard you can squeeze.
3,"OVERALL good, but design really needs help","During holiday time I like to make chocolate for friends. These are incredibly handy for doing designs and reheating the melts. The problem is that one of our bottles broke midthread in the neck of the bottle which caused the melted candy melts to go everywhere, ruining the design. This was (as you could imagine) incredibly frustrating. When these work though, they are very helpful and convenient and pretty easy to clean."
2,Broke on first day use...,"I'm so disappointed about this product. I used it for chocolate making, on the first day it arrives, after like 5 rounds of 10 cavities squeezing, it all of sudden pours certain amount of chocolate fillings over my counter! Then I found the tube mouth (twist part) is half way broke from the bottle, which caused the leakage. So disappointed, and seriously want a refund on it."
2,Okay for thick liquids but not much else,"I use these with paint not food, so I can't comment on microwaving. The threading on the bottle is bad, these are pretty cheap overall. I find these work best with heavy body paint and gel medium which would be about the thickness of ketchup. With water and fluid acrylics they didn't dispense nearly as well. I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Great faucet but check Barclay's website first,This faucet looks great and works wonderfully in my antique clawfoot tub. But this product number (4000) is supposed to be for acrylic tubs only. According to Barclay's website the (4001) model is for cast iron tubs only. I don't know what difference this makes but this information is not stated on Amazon.comI love the faucet regardless and I'm using the (4000) model on my cast iron tub without any problems.
2,Too small,This hat was pretty but if you are 5'9 as I am it may not fit. My head size is much larger than the hat. It felt like I was putting on a child's hat even though it was sold as a lady's hat.
1,disappointing!,I should have read the other 1 star reviews. I bought our ball 2 months ago and saved it for Christmas. Big mistake. We opened it and it was oily as other reviewers have said and once we blew it up we found a pin hole in it. Waste of money. DO BUY THIS!
3,it's okay,"bought it for my 5 yr old niece, she try to play with it but is unable to .. not much you can do with this toy."
1,jumpy ball,I bought this for my 4yr. old and realized when I got it out the package how cheaply it was made. He jumped on it for literally 10 minutes and it got a hole in it! Piece of junk and total waste of money!!
4,Great bouncer!,Item was as expected and was received very quickly. Great birthday toy for our little bouncer. Great for outdoor fun.
4,Fun,I bought this for my almost 2 year old. She is still a little too short to mount and bounce. But she loves to have us bounce her on it. This by far adds a lot of laughter to our house!
2,fun but not great,I think this is OK. It looks like more fun then it actually is. my kids get excited to use it and then after about 30 seconds they have moved on. It is not easy to stay on and bounce. i have a daycare and over think it is a waste of money.
1,Small and Greasy,"I wish I'd paid attention to the reviews of this product before I bought this. It is WAY smaller than it appears in the photo on the box, quite too small for my 5-year-old grandson, and as other reviewers have stated, was quite greasy straight out of the box. Also, this one came with no plug, we had to improvise with a pencil eraser, and the air was completely out of it in an hour. I would not recommend this toy for anyone."
1,TOO BOUNCY,"Could NOT stop bouncing--took over four minutes just to stop bouncying. Hit my head on ceiling--familiy say sI'm not nearly the same. Handle won't come off so you can't store it probably. Also, my cat hates blue. HATES IT. Very angry. Did not come in any soft tones--ridickoulusl. Is not pet safe--TOO BOUNCY. Next time don't go with rubber."
2,NOT GOOD ..,"THEY ARE NOT ALL THAT GREAT .. THEY DONT BOUNCE WELL AND THE KID HAS TO BE A SPECIFIC SIZE FOR IT TO EVEN WORK .. IF TOO SHORT, WONT REACH, IF TOO TALL WONT BOUNCE .. VERY LIMITED .. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK .. FYI: I PURCHASED 2 OF THE SAME .. ONE WAS LARGER THAN THE OTHER .. SAME AMOUNT OF AIR, ONE WAS MADE DIFFERENT I GUESS? .. WEIRD .."
4,Daughter loves it...wish it would keep the air!,"We got this for our four-year-old's birthday and she LOVES it, however, we have to reinflate it every few hours. I will be contacting the manufacturer because this is the only detracting feature of the product."
5,I Got the Best Aunt Ever Award,"I gave this to all of my nieces and nephews that were 3-6 years & they loved it! I actually thought it would be a bigger ball, similar to one I played on in early elementary years, but I am sure I could find a bigger one. Everyone loves the balls, the parents all seemed genuinely pleased & the kids seemed to be having a blast. I think the ball's size is actually pretty good for indoor play."
3,fun ball but leaks pretty easily,"great ball except that it leaks air pretty easily. The little plugs it comes with don't do a great job. I've blown it up a couple times and my kids aren't using it a ton yet. My girls (13 months)love that it has a handle and they mostly just drag it around at this point but when they are older they'll get a kick out of it. It's definitely sturdy, just leaks air quicker than I would have expected. Once they are actually using it the way it's intented I bet it won't hold air for long AT ALL."
2,Not as described!,"Ball is for a 2-3 year old! Marketed as 4 and up, but it's small. It just sits in the corner of the room, unused by our 3 1/2 yearold. Waste of money!"
2,Too small,"Much too small for my 7 year old - you can only inflate it to 44 inches, not 53 inches it says in the description."
2,Much smaller then advertised.,"This product arrived and looks nice and sturdy, but my son was sad when it was too small for him to hop on. He tried a few times and said he didn't like it. He's only 3 years old and the description said it would inflate to 53 inches which was wrong. The hopper would be a good size for a 18 month to a 2 year old. Definately not for an average sized 4 year old and up. My average sized five year old said it was not comfortable to bounce on as she is used to a larger hopper."
1,Ball Bounce Hopper,This ball is not the right size for a child 4+ years. It is very small and when I took it out of the box had a very greasy substance on it.
2,extremely small,this bouncer ball is very well made high quality but unless your child is very short it is an extremely small ball not much bigger than a basketball Very disappointed!
1,bounce ball is covered in oily residue.,This product is covered in some sort of oily film. So oily that i never even let my child play with it. Junk.
2,Too Small,I purchased two of these. they are much smaller than they appear in the ad. I plan to return these.
4,fun toy for kids of all ages!,"This is a great toy for kids of almost of all ages. My sister-in-law has one of these and when we went to visit her, my children played on it all day. If you have a lot of children, I almost recomend getty two of these fun-filled wonderful balls. Not only does the child have a great time, but they also get some-what of a work out! It also supports a lot of wieght. I definitly recomend you get this for your chldren!"
1,Not as advertised!!!,I ordered this for my 10 yr old grand-daughter because the description stated it was for up to a 15 yr old and would accomodate up to 100 pounds. The box states it is for 4 yrs old and up! I am confident if it is suitable for a 4 yr old it is not sufficient for my 10 yr old - big difference in those sizes!!! I could have ordered a number of other bouncers that would have been appropriate but since this was recommended for her size I purchased it and am now stuck with Christmas fast approaching and not wanting to incur return shipping charges!!! BEWARE!!!!
2,Not a good buy,"I bought this ball thinking it could be used outdoors in the grass, however, I soon realized that it is not durable enough for outdoors.My grandchildren used the ball once (heavist child is 50 lbs) and it deflated and could not be used again. It leaks somewhere that we can't find."
2,Won't hold air,"My son enjoys this, but it won't hold air for long. The plug does not fit well and allows the ball to deflate quickly. Pretty serious design flaw in my opinion."
5,Total fun!,I purchased this for my 5 year old and she loves it. Normally you get them toys and after a week or so you find it under the bed in the closet anywhere but playing with it. This toy she ask me all the time where is my hopper. She loves it. AND alot of fun she gets pretty high on it. So do not hesitate it is way cool....
1,bad luck?,"Unfortunately, we never got a chance to try out the hopper. My kids were so excited to try it out, but when I took it out of the box it was greasy! It seemed to be covered in oil. I still do not understand this -- some kind of fluke? I tried to rinse it, but of course the water made no difference. So it was a waste of money for me and a big disappointment for the kids. I just chalk it up to the risk we take by ordering online for the convenience of shopping at home. Once in a while we waste our time and money with bad products."
1,Misleading description,"By the description, this ball should have been big, and fun for my 8 yr olds....not so much. It was better sized to be a toy for my golden retriever....Looking for a bigger one....."
5,"Great toy for all ages! (adults, too)!","I bought one of these Hedstrom Fun Hop balls a few years ago for my two young kids, and it is one of very few toys that have gotten regular use from both of them ever since we got it. As they've grown, we've added a little more air to it to accommodate their size, since it says you can inflate it up to 53"" (which is over 4 feet high, if you do the math!). However, upon the most recent inflation, which made it a little over 2 feet in diameter, they bounced on it a few times, and then it developed a leak near the handle. The ball was very taut, so I just wanted to warn people that the 53"" diameter limit is probably too high. Other than that, this has been a wonderful toy, and I'm planning on buying another one since they've enjoyed it so much and it's good exercise, too."
1,Small and poor quality,"I work with 3 and 4 year old childrenWe have purchased several hopping balls in the past,for inside use during cold weather.These were very small. No resemblance to the picture at all.One continued to deflate and was thrown away. Would not buy this product again."
3,Good quality but very SMALL in size.,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and was disappointed. It says ages 4 and up, and up to 100 lbs, but it's too small for my 6 year old who only weighs 35 lbs. It seems to be made well, but the only one using it is our little Maltese dog who loves to grab the handle and run around with it. If your child is 5 or over, I would go with a larger bouncer."
1,"Item arrived with hole, quickly deflated....","As soon as my husband blew this item up and my kids used it, it deflated. It has a hole. Very disappointed. I hope it was just a one incident thing because this item has good reviews. So I am requesting a replacement to see how that goes."
1,Waste of money.,This was recommended along with a mini-tramp for up to 300 pounds. Very deceptive... since it is rated for 100 pounds. A waste of our money. Not impressed at all.
5,A fun way for your child to get their energy out!,"We have purchased 3 of these balls (2 as gifts and one for our 3 year old). All of them were easy to inflate and have lasted despite plenty of use. You can't beat the price, either.This is great as an indoor or outdoor toy. We use ours in the playroom and the backyard.It's a great inexpensive gift that a child will be thrilled to receive. I haven't seen a kid yet who can resist this fun toy."
4,Smaller than expected...but a BIG hit!,"My 4 year old loved and still loves this Christmas gift from Santa! He hops around the house on it all the time. When we first blew it up Christmas Eve, we were surprised how small it was (I bought the medium thinking he could grow into it) but he doesn't seem to mind. I would suggest going up a size when ordering. Overall, one of his favorites. It's nice to see a good ole fashioned toy wins out these days!"
3,"Strong, nice, but small","Like the color, durability, thickness of it but is smaller than I thought. I have a big 5 year old and it looks like its good for a 3 or 4 year old."
4,Pretty Good,"Like others have said, the size is small but it's too big for my almost 2 year old son. I just let some of the air out of it so his feet can touch the floor and he plays with it. My 3 year old niece came over and played with it though and it seemed the perfect size for her.I'm sure anyone over the age of 4 would have to crouch to use it though.It seems to have a weird greasy coating over it, which isn't *that* big a deal except I couldn't find my pump and so just blew it up with my mouth (I told you it was fairly small!). Either way though, I think it will be a fun toy once my kid gets the hang of it."
3,Fun but doesn't hold air well.,Product meets our needs just after air fillup but about half the air leaks out over 48 hours. would be better if it had a valve like a basketball.
2,Slimy,"Product arrived promptly. When I went to open the ball to inflate it, the ball was covered in a slimy film. Haven't even inflated the ball yet because I'm not sure I want my kids touching it. Get the Little Tikes ball instead!"
3,Good bouncy ball for a toddler,"My daughter is almost 3, and it's the perfect size for her. I wouldn't recommend it for bigger kids (e.g. over 6 years old).It's a good ball for the price - my only real complaint would be that after opening the package, the product feels like it's covered in oil. I had to scrub it down before it could be used. That, and I've found I need to put air in it about every couple of weeks.If it I could give it 3.5 stars I would, but just couldn't give it four."
4,Grease ball,"I bought this for my nephew who is three. He needs some practice figuring out how to sit astride and simultaneously bounce, but I am sure it won't be too long before he gets the hang of it. His brother,who is five, enjoyed it a lot. This was bought as a gift and I decided to blow it up before giving it. Thank goodness. There was grease all over the ball making it very slimy ... I had to use soap and water to clean it or it would have left stains on the boys' pants and carpet - not to mention making it unsafe to hold onto. Perhaps due to the extreme heat lately the manufacturers felt they needed to keep the material supple - but this was way too much. It seemed like it may have been a food grade oil, as it did not have a chemical odor. Nevertheless, check inside the box before giving this as a gift. For those who would like to know the size: they say to not inflate it beyond a 44"" circumference and it can expand by about an inch after inflation."
2,Too Small,"We purchased this for our four-year-old son because he is always trying to use his five-year-old sister's hopper ball. We figured it would save us a lot of fights in the future and allow both children to get some exercise indoors. The durability seems good, but the ball is much smaller than our five-year-old's. Our son was disappointed and has pretty much ignored it for the week he's had it. He is about 42 inches tall. I could see this ball being good for an 18-month-old or even a two-year-old, but it did not work for an average-build four-year-old. We'll be giving it to our niece for her 2nd birthday in a month and replacing it with a bigger one for our son."
1,so so small!!,"The ball was too small for my average height/weight 4 y/o girl and it barely accommodated my 2 y/o son. Also, seemed almost slimy or wet when I opened package with a very strong plastic odor. Returned immediately."
5,Heavy-duty bouncin' fun!,"I bought this for my 5 year old niece -- who doesn't get a lot of exercise. She instantly started ""bouncing"" all over the place and can work up a pretty good little sweat. Great exercise and great fun!"
2,Not the same Voyage of the Disco Era...,"First of all, this is not the same Voyage disco group that played the well known ""Souvenirs"". This is a percussion group from Asia that doesn't exactly do Disco. Bought this CD thinking about a possible comeback CD from the same people that brought us ""Let's Fly Away"", but my assumption was pretty far from truth.On the other hand, I like this kind of foreign music so, after all, wasn't as bad as it may seem."
5,It's great,This one is very invigorating yet also very calming and centering at the same time I love her tapes I will definitly buy more they are wonderful.
4,"Good, natural ""jungle sounds""","I play this one all day for my breeding pair of macaw parrots, just to make them feel more 'at home'. It is all natural sounds, be it bird-calls or tropical rain. There is no added music, which I consider to be a huge plus. Also, the insert to the CD lists all the birds that are featured, and where to find them on the various tracks."
4,For the Greek,"I bought this copy of Aurelius' Meditations primarily for the Greek. As an earlier reviewer has noted, the English translation offered here is archaic, and unnecessarily so. Unless the translator was translating in the middle ages, which he wasn't, there's no need to use ""thee,"" ""thou,"" etc. The Greek suggests nothing of the sort. So, if you are interested in reading Aurelius in Greek, and like me, are unable to find an Oxford Classics edition, then this is a worthwhile purchase."
2,can't recommend the Greek or English for NT Greek learners,"I am assuming that a lot of people who might be interested in this are people learning NT Greek and this review is intended for them. I bought this after being very satisfied with the Loeb Epictetus. (See my review.) But Aurelieus' Greek is harder and less elegant (more optatives, more vocab that does not appear in the NT, more eliptical expressions) and this translation is simply AWFUL. Again and again I found I had to refer back to George Long's older translation to unpack the Greek, which defeats the purpose of a diglot. Aurelius is still wonderful for Christians, but until a diglot with a better translation comes out, I would skip this and focus on other non-biblical Greek."
2,Like reading the King James Bible,If you like the prose in the King James Bible you will love this translation. I would look for something in modern english.
5,The Tongue a Creative Force,"The Tongue: A Creative Force (Paperback)I love the book! I don't get down so often because, when I do get down, I am reminded of the teachings in the book and that perks me up. The book flows well and is fun to read."
5,The Tongue: A Creative Force,"This is an excellent book and an excellent read. It is a must have in the library of all Christians, and in fact, for all those who understand the power of the spoken word and how our words impact our lives. I read some part of this book every day. Each time that I pick this book up to read, I receive new revelation knowledge or a reminder of what I already know. This new revelation or reminder of what I know helps to encourages me to enforce the principles of the spoken word daily. The bible says that you have what you say. I believe that. If we reflect on any given time and point in our lives, we see manifested in our lives all that we have spoken into existence.I give this book the highest rating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Tongue: A Creative Force,This book has saved our lives. What we say is so important. Life and Death is in the power of our tongue and we choose Life! We buy these books in bulk as we have bible study on this book twice a year and give them to the people we teach. This book will change the way you speak over yourself and family and people around you. Buy it you will not regret it!
5,THE POWER,"THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL BOOK. THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE I FOUND OUT JUST WHAT THE WORDS WE SPEAK EVERYDAY CAN MEAN TO US....CHARLES CAPPS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL BIBLE EXPERT WITH A WONDEFFUL INSIGHT INTO THE CREATOR AND JUST HOW MUCH POWER HE ACCTUALLY GAVE US TO CREATE AS HE HAS....USING OUR WORDS AS SEEDS WE PLANT INTO THE UNIVERSE AND REAP THE HARVEST OF OUR WORDS AS HE DID, WHETHER FOR OUR GOOD OR OUR BAD...MANKIND HAS BEEN IGNORANT OF THIS FACT AND HAS PLANTED THE SEEDS OF HIS OWN DISTRUCTION WITH HIS MOUTH FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS!...DOES THE PHRASE ""I'LL BE DAMNED"" SOUND FAMILIAR?...DO YOU WANT TO FEEL HUMBLED? DO YOU WANT TO FEEL POWERFUL?...THIS BOOK WILL INFORM YOU AND CERTAINLY MAKE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO EVERY WORD YOU SAY....HOORAY FOR CHARLES CAPPS!"
5,Must Read,Fantasic book to learn how to operate the spiritual power available to all who choose to believe God's word. Deliverance and the more than abundant life can be yours. This book is rightly divided biblically and very interesting.
4,for the saved only-advanced learning,"There IS power in the Word...spoken. Believers DO have authority given by Christ. Capps is an expert at teaching these truths. Yet, he doesn't teach any other foundational truths of the Bible, which may hinder those without strong ""roots"". Also, I don't enjoy his writing style, e.g. he changes phonts alot for emphasis(i assume) which I don't get and he is repetitive. I do enjoy listening to him on the radio, and will look for his dvds and cds."
1,Caution!,"I would caution any one from reading this book. It is a name and claim it. Be careful! This man states that we are NOT to pray to Jesus only to the Father. He also states that we are NOT to pray for the will of God. See my review on his book ""Releasing the Ability of God""."
4,The almost whole truth,"Someone in '01 wrote about this book, ""Forget using a highlighter to mark your favorite passages in this book; just dip the whole book in yellow ink""; and I second that emotion. I could not have said it better. It was recommended to me by a grade school chum and I could not have read it at a better time.As Mr. Capps said, ""Quit praying the problem and speak the answer"". I now watch and consider my words. It is actually fun watching the transformation and funny thing is, it doesn't cost a thing and I am confident that the result(s) will be well worth it.The book is written simplistically, can be read in a day. I am passing it on to my children.A very positive read."
2,Not the same show.,"One of the great things about the first three seasons, the cast seemed to gel effortlessly. In this darker, melodramatic season, there were a few times you could notice the actors actually struggle in their performances. There are also a few moments of poor editing. Season 4 really shows how well done the first three seasons were. By not being that well done.The two-part episode was Castle's ""jumping the shark"" moment for me. The bad icing on a poorly baked cake. No more Castle, ever.Andrew, enjoy your new membership in the Ministry of Trope Propaganda. From now on, I'll avoid anything you are attached to."
5,Love the chemistry between Castle and Beckett,I am a late joiner of the Castle fan club and I wish I had discovered it sooner. I love that I can watch the reruns on TNT and buy episodes on Amazon.Anyone who enjoys crime dramas will enjoy and with this show there is that added twist of the Castle/Beckett chemistry.Enjoy
5,castle season 4,"Love castle! Season four is one of the best seasons! If you like romantic, funny, and some drama in a show you have come to the right place."
4,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","Castle has developed a winning formula over the years, and despite having a slightly darker tone overall, this season doesn't mess with the formula too much. Everyone has to get used to working with a new Chief, and we have the usual back and forth with Beckett and Castle. The cases range from the slightly absurd (a possible zombie killing) to the macabre, and as usual Beckett's mother's case pops up a couple of times.If you liked the first three seasons, there's nothing here to put you off. The banter is quick and witty. The characters interact well, and the cases continue to be twist filled and pretty interesting."
3,"The season to skip, storywise.","At the end of season three, there was a Big Reveal. This season spends most of its time pretending that never happened, and essentially recycles the Big Reveal. You could watch seasons 1, 2, 3, and 5 when it comes out without missing any story.That, to me, makes this season garbage. I absolutely love the show and the characters (when they are acting in character), and have been enjoying the show until this season. I have high hopes that next season will make up for it."
5,Castle: Season 4,"I absolutely LOVE this show!!! The Hunky Nathan Fillion and the Sexy/Beautiful Stana Katic. These two have the kind of chemistry I haven't seen on Television in a very long time. But, I don't think the show would be where it is without the two leads. I don't think I would watch the show if Nathan or Stana wasn't in it...They are that good. I don't mean to take anything away from the supporting cast because they are excellent as well. I Love Lanie, Esposito, Ryan, Alexis, and of course Mama Castle,lol. They all play there rolls perfectly. If you've never seen ""Castle"" start with Season 1 and watch their journey...yes, at times it has been frustrating,irritating...but patience will prevail! I'm a major ""Caskett"" Shipper and I am sooooooo ready for their hookup!"
1,Castle episode 81,I ordered it and was charged for it but it wouldn't play on my computer. I have yet to hear from tech support.
3,Something has been lost,"While I still enjoy some of the Castle shows, clearly something has been lost. The chemistry between Castle and Becket is still there, but his relationships between him and his daughter turned really strange. It was almost as if they couldn't decide if she was going to be a troublesome teen, or the same smart, loving daughter we've all come to know. I do think that Nathan Fillion should lose a few pounds for the show. They constantly hide him in black clothes, and it is a shame that he hasn't done a better job of keeping in shape. The supporting cast do a good job of keeping the show moving, although the new Captain is a bit too stereotypical."
5,Entertaining,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is a true Castle fan (and so is our daughter). They both love it and are certain to recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a copy. I will admit to liking it as well. Handy to not have any commercials in the segments!
5,Great Show,Love the show and the fourth season is just as good as the other three! The interplay by the leads is the best!
5,Awesome Episode!,I watch every Castle and was so disturbed that the very last scene I lost on my DVR. I was so happy to be able to order it here so cheap and easy to download. I finally got to see the kiss of the season.!
3,Love the Show - Hate the Package,I love Castle. All 4 Seasons have been the greatest and am enjoying season 5. I just got season 4 and am enjoying it once again. I do have one complaint and that's why I have given it a rating of 3 and it's the packaging. I wished they had of given it the flip inserts instead of packing one on top of the other. I keep having to move disks around and be extra careful so I don't scratch them. I sure hope next season they package it like they did season 2 & 3. The price we pay is definately worth that little bit of extra.
5,Another Castle classic.,"Alright, if you have been watching the season so far, you know Castle and Beckett have been going through a rough patch. In this episode, Castle has pretty much decided this latest case will be his last. So...he wants to go out with the coolest case ever...and the city of New York complies in classic fashion. A professional is attacked and partially eaten in a parking garage by a.....zombie! The only witness was also bitten and thinks he is going to become a zombie as well. What more could you ask for, lol. Castle has that wide eyed child like look on his face when the suspected zombie is revealed, which is awesome. Coolest case ever? Maybe. Either way, this episode is pretty hilarious, and ends well leading into the season finale. One of my favorites as of yet.Enjoy!"
5,Kick The Ballistics,This episode was another good episode. I loved the storyline and the fact that it made you think. I didn't like the fact that the bad guy tried to frame Ryan. I am really pleased with this purchase.
5,Great acting and directing and Writing,"The scripts are so much fun - good tension, plenty of surprises and clever humor. The whole cast works together so well to make for great stories."
5,Wonderful gifted cast.,The best cast on television. Can't wait to see the next episode each week. I make a point to watch each episode. This is the only show I make a point to watch.
5,Castle - Season 4,"Love the television series! Like watching until the end because that's when you find out who really did away with somebody. The characters are great, Ryan, Exposito, Martha, Alexis, Kate, the coroner, and of course, Castle. All of them blend together really well! Mary Laenger"
5,Castle.,Where did this show come from? I was vacationing in New York and I came across this show on my hotel room and from then on Im stuck.
5,Best ever!,Castle is one of the best shows on television today. It has a wonderful mix of comedy and serious situations that make it like tv crack :-)
5,Castle Season 4,"I love this show. The relationship between Kate Beckett and Richard Castle is what got me ""hooked"" up to this show. I am glad to have this show as part of my video library."
5,Awesome,Just found Castle through re-runs and now I'm hooked. Had to catch up from the beginning. This show is great. The characters are so real world especially their facial expressions.
2,Castle DVD keeps skipping.,"Even though this disks are brand new, they play each episode and then freeze and then skip to the credits. It is extremely frustrating and annoying. I don't like that I spent all that kind of money and have to turn around and buy it all over again. This is the second product that I have purchased through Amazon and the second one that I have had some sort of problem with. Amazon went well out of their way for the last thing that I bought, to make sure that I was satisfied. That is the reason that I keep returning to buy things. Maybe I'll find another copy of this that is worth buying."
4,What happened to the HD?,"I love the Castle series and have purchased the first three seasons on Amazon. I love the convenience of it. I have noticed that this season does not seem to be a true ""HD"". Don't know if it is just a few episodes or the whole thing."
5,Castle Still King,"Season 4 of ""Castle"" starts and ends with game-changing episodes. But all of the episodes in between are great, too. You get the trusty episodes with twists and turns that are all wrapped up in an hour, in addition to the continuing story arc revolving around the mystery surrounding Beckett's mother's murder. I really appreciated that in season 4 all of the characters have finally come into their own - including Kate Beckett - and the supporting cast gets more of a chance to be a part of the action. There are some great scenes where characters Kevin Ryan and Javier Esposito get to shine. And through it all, you see Beckett and Castle becoming more of a team, on and off duty. I'm glad I've added Castle season 4 to my DVD collection."
4,Great for anyone who wants to learn how to play guitar!,I bought this set for my husband for his birthday. The guitar is just beautiful and the amp sounds great and is compact. The guitar case is good quality too. Personally I don't think the pitch pipe is good for those who want to learn to play. I spent $30 and got a really nice guitar tuner. The picks are average quality and the learning CD won't get a newby very far. The few negatives are far outweighed by the beautiful guitar and amp. I'm so glad I settled on this guitar and so is my husband. :)
2,not satisfied,"I ORDERED THIS ITEM IN MARCH AND THE AMP HAS ALREADY QUIT WORKING. IT HAS NOT BEEN MISUSED AND HAS NOT BEEN USED VERY MUCH. FOR $200.00, I WOULD EXPECT IT TO LAST AT LEAST A YEAR."
2,Bad Amp,"The amp performance is bad, also started making crazy noice the 2nd day of arrival. Disappointing when you give someone a gift, and doesnt work."
2,Beware the tuning heads.,"We bought this for a beginner and soon discovered it was almost nonplayable because of flaws in the heads and nut.We didn't expect this to be ""set-up"" but it is preety much impossible to tune which for anyone is very discouraging. Too bad Epiphone lets the Chinese downgrade what used to be a good model."
1,Beware!,"The seller Woodwind and Brasswind who offers a ""free shipping"", also collects the ""sales tax"" even though he is shipping from other state (New Mexico). RIGHT..... If I wanted to pay a sales tax, I'd go to the store. Interestingly enough, the amount of tax pretty much covers shipping charged by other sellers. BTW, you'd be chrged a tax after you press the button. They forgot to mention in their ad that they will be playing a tax man..."
4,excellent starting point for multimedia copyrights,"For multimedia developers, this book is a great stepping stone. It explains the entire copyright process, including what forms to fill when and why. It also goes in depth about copyright infringment and attaining rights. As a bonus, it includes samples of library of congress forms, and also contains the actual forms needed to apply for a copyright. This book is inexpensive, and i'd recommend to anyone."
3,"Class book, I don't plan to keep","The writing style of this book is formal and elaborate. This makes for a long read to wade through the wordiness to find the point. The common writing style in which the opening sentence introduces the point of the paragraph, the closing sentence summarizes and leads to the next paragraph, is not used. This makes skimming less effective, leaving the reader stuck to wading through the words. The content is useful, once you comb through the presentation."
3,really works good,I really like the way this product works for me. I lose the pms bloating that occurs monthly when I take it. It makes me feel slimmer too.
1,very dangerous pills,"these are very dangerous pills, even when taking 6-10 glasses of water a day, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like I could die any moment. It also gave me a bad headache all day long. If you want to lose water weight, a couple tips you can use: walk for one hour on the treadmill and you will drop one pound of water weight, maybe more. Also drink lots of water and you will lose water weight over night. Do not risk your health buying this, it's not worth it. read most of the reviews on this product, most of them are members of the company, notice how they all are saying the same thing with no variation in content or writing style, it is probably one person writing over and over. don't know why people are willing to sell their souls for a buck. I would never take this product again, unless I had a death wish"
2,didn't work,"I tool the pills,but I didn't notice any difference in my output.buy it if you want,but I wont buy it again"
5,good diuretic,"good diuretic i lost the water weight i needed to after a ""salty"" vacation :) helped me alot and worked pretty fast. i love it and will order another bottle when i finish this one."
2,Ok,"This was a great flash drive. Within a few months after I purchased it, it just stopped working. I called up Sony, I sent it back to them and within a few weeks, they sent me a new flash dive that is twice the capacity and seems to work great. Before it broke, it worked great."
5,Stop-A-Clog Drain Protector,"The product does exactly what it professes to do. I couldn't find another product to cover the open drain and catch hair in my older tub/shower. This product stays in place very effectively with it's 6 suction cups and prevents clogs as long as people don't remove it. It does require a smooth surface, however - the suction cups won't hold an rough surfaces."
2,Stop A Clog Protector,I found the Stop-A-Clog Protector did not work for my bathtub drain but I cut the Protector to fit over my drain head and it collects some hair. The suction cups did not work on my bathtub floor. I will continue to use this product as it is the best available for my situation.
2,Inadequate size and suction,"My long hair has caused clogs in the shower on more than one occasion, so we set out to find the perfect drain cover. This item did not succeed for us. As others have mentioned, the diameter was too small for our two standard shower drains (the 5"" measurement listed is the outside edges, not the size of drain it covers), so the suction areas overlap the drain edge and won't hold. This leaves the cover to slip around from a nudge of the foot or a direct hit from the shower flow. When it actually stays in place for a few minutes it will catch some hair, but not enough--we still got a clogged drain from the hair that slipped past. The positives I can mention are the fact that you get two covers in the pack and the covers are soft and squishy, so they do not get broken or hurt your foot if you accidently step on them. But we are still on the hunt for a good drain cover."
1,Haircatcher does not catch hair,"I bought this haircatcher as Bed, Bath and Beyond no longer sold our beloved previous haircatcher. This one doesn't work and allows most of the hair to pass through. The hair actually slips under the suction cups and the suction cups catch probably about 10% of the hair. We will not be buying this product again and will probably be asking for our money back. Don't waste your time on this product."
2,Disappointing Hair Trap,This hair catch allows all but the largest floating debris to escape down the drain. The size of the strainer holes needs to be reduced.
1,Didn't stop hair; mildew grows quickly.,"This product didn't work for my needs. I have a lot of fine hair, and the hair went through the protector easily. So the tub continues to be clogged. Also, mildew grew on the protector very quickly. Gross. I've only had it for a few months and I'm going to throw it out because its useless."
1,It does not work.,"I'm using this in a bathtub/shower. I have long hair and wanted to prevent clogs. The hair slips right under the product. It has little suction buttons (not cups) around the base. I have them as tight and flush to the tub as it will go. I've watched the hair stop at the rubber, then slip right through! Try a different brand, don't waste your money with this one."
4,Serves its purpose,"Product works very well. I have a pull, pop up type drain so I had to cut a little bit at the top to fit. After that 20 seconds of work, it fits and works wonderfully. My wife's hair is extremely long and easily gets trapped in the product. I've been using it for about a month now, and the drain has been perfect...I usually need to Drano every week, but haven't had to thus far. My tub is extremely old as well, and the suction cups don't exactly stick to the bottom, but it still traps the hair. For the price, would definitely recommend."
5,Drain Protector,"I thought I was catching most of my hair by combing it out and setting it aside, but now I can see how much was going down the drain. This explains so much. It stays in place pretty well, and is keeping a significant amount of hair out of my plumbing. I would recommend it for anyone with a lot of hair."
4,No more clogs,Bought this item to use on drain in my tube/shower. While it is not 100% effective it works well enough that I have not had to unclog my drain since using this item.
3,Crossword Puzzle Dictionries,"Both have their merits. The Webster's print is larger and it seems to go more in depth on some topics. The Million dictionary has a lot more entries but sometime there very little information - you'll find ""Smith"" John and that is it."
2,Not that great.,"I bought this based on the reviews of others. It's not particularly helpful and it is physically huge! It is an interesting reference book, but not very helful for solving crossword puzzles. Buy something else (I know I will)."
3,Good,"This was bought for my husband and he said it is good , but not as good as the last edition. Which by the way fell apart."
2,Portugal is Missing in the Picture,"Any book about East Timor should dedicate a chapter to the Portuguese foreign policy about this issue. It was the East Timorese and the Portuguese who kept this question alive when nobody wanted to know. Therefore, explaining and understanding East Timor in the last 25 years must include Portugal. Unfortunately, this is not the case. On the other hand, with one or two exceptions, the chapters do not bring any relevant new information. If you have an average knowledge about this issue, this book will not bring you much insight. Definitely, this is not a must."
1,"""Peace""-- HA!","If this a ""Concert for Peace,"" give me war anytime! Mouskouri is shrill and practically unlistenable on several of this disc's tracks."
1,Is this Nana?,Nana may have lost her touch. The voice is weak and the performance is very cold. The supporting band is obviously weak and fails at many points in the concert. The sound quality is poor and the audience is very noisy. NOT recommended.
5,Great Electric Toothbrush!,This is the best electric toothbrush because of the brushes.The contoured tipped one is awesome. Especially for brace wearers.The brushes last a long time. They cover all surfaces of each tooth. It has eliminated my pockets and gingivitis! It is worth the cost. Don't forget to plug it in to charge it or you'll have to go back to the basic toothbrush.
3,'tween the teeth,"This shorter head is okay. I prefer the longer point as it works better for me and my big mouth! :) However, it is a great head to use on top of the molars and between some of my ""not-totally"" straight teeth. I like it, but I don't find it as necessary as the other two heads that Rota-Dent offers."
3,Overpriced,"I bought the Rotadent from my dentist because he insisted it was better than anything else. I honestly don't see a difference between this and the Oral-B electronic brush I was using previously. What is annoying though is that these brushheads are ridiculously priced here. At the dentists office I can get them for about $9 each. Online they're $30? I'll say the product is pretty good, but not worth the price in my opinion. I think it's just a way for the dentist to make more money."
5,Excellent service,Love the price and how quickly I received the toothbrush head. Better price than the Dentist's office. I will certainly be back to order more
2,Poor fit amazon,"The brush is not a tight fit and consequently needs to be held in place. This is very awkward and a disappointment. In the past, I have purchased this brush with none of the short comings. From other vendor."
2,"WWECW = Terrible, Doesnt compare to REAL ECW",The first DVD looks pretty good but the 2nd is just a piece of crap to throw in the grabage. The new ECW looked promising at ONS but since week 1 it has gone to rock bottom. Its not ECW and should be laid to rest rather than ruin the name of the greatest thing to happen to wrestling. I saw Wrestling Society X last night and this owns anything in wrestling today even though theirs a few flaws but it has potential to blow away WWECW. I say avoid this DVD. Watch some UFC or WSX... Later.
1,THE NEW ECW SUCKS,"Like other reviews, the new ECW just straight up SUCKS @** I wish they would let ECW Rest In Peace. Thank You Paul E. Heyman, Vince you Suck, long live REAL Entertaining Wrestling TNA."
4,My favorite ECW dvd,"My stepdad bought this along with 3 more dvds on 8-22-12 at Wal-Mart.com & I have to say I love it. Every match on there was great, the RVD/Hardcore Holly match was awesome. A must-have for any ECW fans."
4,Extremely Ruined,"ECW Extreme Rules is BLAH, I love the first disc but the 2nd disc is nothing special.Score it cheap if you can."
3,E C DUB,"ECW was the best wrestling promotion in the world. Look how many talented wreslers came from ECW: Beniot, Mysterio, RVD, Sabu, Sandman, Tanaka, Awesome, Raven, the list goes on and on. There feuds were far better then anything in WCW or WWE every done. Tanaka vs Awesome, Sabu vs RVD, Jerry Lynn VS RVD are prime examples of this. Im sick of WWE releasing Best of ECW, espeically since they have ruined the company. They should release best of Sandman or Sabu. For now, I'll watch old ECW, the real ECW."
5,vintage ECW,Anything with the classic ECW is great if you have grown up watching the pay per view shows that they offered. Great alternative to the more popular WWF product from back then.
4,It Gets A Four Star Rating Because Of Disc 1,"I won't do my usual match by match review because others have already adequetely done it. I will say that Disc 1 is the only reason to get this release because it has the classic ECW.Disk 2 is only worth a look for the following matches:The Dudley Boyz Vs. Tommy Dreamer & The Sandman (ECW One Night Stand 2005)Rob Van Damn Vs. Rey Mysterio (ECW Vs. WWE)Rey Mysterio Vs. Sabu (ECW One Night Stand 2006)Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk & Beulah Vs. Edge, Lita & Mick Foley (ECW One Night Stand 2006)The rest of the matches from the recent ECW are pretty much weak though I did find some entertainment in Sabu VS. RVD in a ladder match, Flair Vs. The Big Show and RVD Vs. Hardcore Holly where Holly suffered that horrid gash in his upper back!Beyond that, Disc 2 isn't worth much. I'd buy this one for Disc 1. If you want a good ECW package from WWE, I'd recommend ECW Bloodsport."
3,A note,"While other reviewers have already noted that the match between Tommy Dreamer and Brian Lee has alternate commatary feat. Tommy Dreamer and Coach it should also be known that the Taz Vs. Sabu match from Living Dangerously 99' has alternate commatary feat. Joey Styles and Taz. That should be interesting to listen to. As for the DVD itself, do not buy it if you already own the original ECW pioneer DVDs, all of these matches have already been released except for two. While i hate the WWE version of ECW, some of the matches on here where pretty good. Ric Flair Vs. Big Show and RVD Vs. Hardcore Holly were brutal matches."
3,"Something Stinks, and its disk 2 of this set","Disk 1.... awesome! Old ECW in high quality! Great stuff and great matches!Disk 2 starts out ok, with ECW ONS 2005, which was the closest well ever get to the real ECW under VinnyMacs control. The rest of the matches = garbage. That said, I got my moneys worth with the first disk, disk 2 I will use as a coaster for my drink as I watch Old ECW tapes.Interesting sidenote. WWE brought back ECW because of the fan loyality, Stuff you see on disk 1 and the success of ONS 2005. Why would they then water down and pump out the garbage that is on disk 2?!?"
2,Beatle Barkers,"No, this isn't actually a Beatles album. The manufacturers of this CD were sued by the Beatles, because the cover might lead one to think it is a Beatles album. So, what is this album really? Well, back in the early-1980s, an album was released called ""Beatle Barkers"" credited to ""The Woofers and Tweeters Orchestra"". It featured Beatles tunes barked by dogs, with other animals chiming in from time to time. Of course, it was fake, with synthesized animals sounds doing the actually ""singing"". Good for a few laughs, though. Anyway, in the mid-1990s someone reissued the album with a deceptive cover, promptly got sued, and the CD was withdrawn. Here is the track listing:1. I want to Hold Your Hand2. Love Me Do3. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da4. We Can Work It Out5. I Saw Her Standing There6. I Feel Fine7. Can't Buy Me Love8. All My Loving9. Day Tripper10. She Loves You11.

4,mind boggle,"Interesting thermodynamic stuff. Actual conspiracy theory sounds a mite far fetched when realising the intelligence and technology involved with these ""Greys"". However, definitely gets the ""Grey"" matter working overtime!"
5,Awesome pan!! Worth the money!,This pan is awesome. It's very well built and sturdy. I am a huge Calphalon pan user and this one is one of their best. Worth every penny!
1,This shoe not recommend,"It is a product of poor quality and the sole is taking off and the material is so bad that in tropical country like my feet warms you to unimaginable levels, causing my bad odors. Would recommend to buy them."
2,not impressed,shoe is not really what I expected. It has a plastic or rubber texture namely the sole of the shoe.
2,Different shade of brown,The shoe has a different shade of brown from the one shown on the website.Not what I expected. Disappointed.
3,Decent shoe,Good enough shoe if you like long toed shoes. Not for wide feet though. And leather creases a bit too easily.
1,Terrible Quality,"I bought this pair a couple of weeks ago. When I saw it and my mind said ""Note to self moment."" Very disappointed with the quality. The leather was poor, like it came from a REALLY cheap factory in China. If there was a better word than sub standard it was worse. The form was on the heel was really bad. Even the logo inside was really terrible. Everything about this, the materials, and how it was made is a mess. It also says ""hand made"" ... in China. A waste of good money. Disappointed with KC. There are better brands out there. Pass on this please."
2,Horrible Quality,"The shoes started to fall apart after a week of wearing them. I only wore these shoes at work, never work them outside of my office, and they still fell apart. The quality was shotty."
2,Painful and Wear Out Too Fast,"I bought these shoes with the mindset of wearing them everyday to work. Unfortunately, these shoes do not cut it. I have had them for 6 months now and the black color is wearing off and the sole of the shoe is very thin, which causes your feet to feel every impact or pebble when you step. It looks really nice when you first wear it and that is what it is meant for, which is the occasional party. I walked a couple miles in the city with these and they killed my feet with pain at the end of the day. So if you want it for a once in the while use, then go for it. But if you plan to wear it everyday, expect painful results."
4,when will you get cognac color on size 12 or 13??,"I have been waiting for these shoes to get back in size 12 or 13 for a long time now and still nothing. I want to buy them, they are amazing shoes. When are they going to be available?"
1,Do not buy this shoe!,I bought a pair about 6 months ago and it is already falling apart. The outer soles on both shoes are coming off on both sides of the shoes.
4,Good shoes,I usually don't like Kenneth Coles because of comfort but these are comfortable shoes. The styling adds some flair to loafers which sometimes can be boring. The quality seems good with good stitching.
3,Good,"Very stylish, good quality. Bought it at a great price ($40). Its not outstanding (ie, 4 stars) or Must buy (5 stars), but very good and recommend."
3,Good Support,The Bauerfeind EpiTrain Elbow Support provides good support with great mobility. It's best used for athletic actvitities. Provides great support when placed on the elbow properly the problem is there are no directions that specifically detail how the put the thing on to maximize it's use. After using it for a couple weeks I thought I had wasted my money until one day i put it on differently and experienced great support. Product instructions need improvement but other than that a good support.
4,Bauerfeind Elbow Brace,"I agree with a lot of the previous reviews of this product. However, I just cut the tag off without trying to remove the stitches and it posed no irritation problem. Also, I had no problem sizing by following the directions on the Bauerfeind website. This brace is not good for heavy work. I use another brace if there is the possibility of putting a lot of strain on my elbow. But it is good for everyday support. I don't understand why it is so expensive, but I'd rather have it than not. BK"
5,Avarage,"This is probably the one of the best books about Kurds out there, but it still does not do justice to a complex issue. I am a Kurd and I don't want to live in an ethnically-pure state or anything like that. Most Kurds are happy in democratic Turkey, and there is no real Kurdish problem here..."
4,Easy readability,"makes this a must-have for students. Each chapter is organized like a scholarly paper, so whether reading straight-through or in small amounts, it is a coherent history of the Kurdish problem in Turkey through to the 1990s. Exceptional organization for quick reference. Barkey and Fuller provide enough details to give a grasp of the problems Turkey is facing with regard to Kurdish nationalism, without cluttering their message with so much detail as to confuse the reader. Further, they make their own suggestions for resolution, reasons for those suggestions, and potential obstacles to achieving a peaceful resolution that is worth considering. Even though the book was published in the 90s, the information is mostly applicable to todays events. The scope is not completely limited to Turkey, as it also includes Iran, Iraq and Syria--their own ""Kurdish Questions"" and the recent interplay between those states and Turkey."
2,Inspired Cuisine is better.,"I found out that the Nestle European Style Mousse mix (the leading brand in the U.S.) is now sold under the Inspired Cuisine brand name. It's still the best out there, by far."
5,Whew!!! it was a wonderful read...,"Who ever says THIS is a slow paced book hasn't read the great classics.THe best books i have read are ones in which you do not wish to leave the characters behind. Though the writer could have written more about the characters but basically its a tale of journey and self-discovery & that is what has been portrayedI love medieval times, it was as if they were magical times, with honor, modesty and the world just beginning to grow right before your eyes. It was an age of enlightment and this book does in a way tell you what would have gone on during the 14th century."
3,Ramsay Scallop,"I liked this book, but in my opinion it ends too early. The numerous stories that were told by the characters were unnecessary and dragged on. On a better note, I found many parts realistic, enchanting and sweet. A very interesting book like none I've read before."
2,Zacs book review,"This book was well done but I did not like the story very much, as it was too low key. If you like action novels this is not for you. It is about a pilgrimage that two people pleged to marry each other even though they don't want to. A smart priest realizes that a pilgrimage might just bring them closer together.And so they go with nothing other than two horses,some food, and the a special rough cloth used for clothing."
2,Ramsy Scallop review,"I didn't think this book would be as interesting as it sounded on the back cover. As a teenager, I thought this book was boring and not worth reading. In the book, the two did not have enough chemistry to make the book interesting. It kept going on and on and had too much detail for me, when I thought it should have been less descriptive, at times. Yet, also at times I would feel that it was worth reading, because some parts of this book were quite exciting. Over all, I did not like the book as much as I thought I would, and would definetly rate it being 2 out of 5 stars."
1,Hated It,"Book summary was nothing like what the book was about at all. Not much of a fantastic or worthy middle ages book to read. Found CATHERINE, CALLED BIRDY much more interesting and challenging."
1,Don't bother.,"Temple's view of the Middle Ages is historically inaccurate, completely anachronistic, and blatantly biased. This is not historical fiction...this is the treatise of a woman with an axe to grind. As a professional children's librarian and an amateur medievalist, I'd say, ""Don't waste your time."""
1,There must be a science behind making books this boring.,The book The Ramsay Scallop is a very boring book.This book is very hard to relate to because of the time period it is set in(the middle ages )because they did everything differently. The characters Thomas and Elenor just kind of walked around doing their own thing just waiting for something to happen. They weren't really looking forward to anything nor did they have to stop anywhere to do anything on their pilgrimage.This book lacked action and suspence.I would never recommend The Ramsay Scallop to any any readers especially young readers because after they read a chapter or so they will not want to read it they will want to lock it up in a closet. I do not recommend The Ramsay Scallop to readers of any ages.
5,Real friendships have to develop.,"They didn't hate each other. They were just complete strangers to each other and were scared and confused. Their journey helped them find friendship with each other and to consult with each other when they had these alienating feelings. I enjoyed watching their feelings grow, it is what makes the whole book all the more realistic."
2,AW COME ON!,"This book was absolutely the most slow-moving book in the world. I mean, at first, it looked good, but immediately became something like a chapter from a socials textbook... This is definitly a boring book. Thomas and Elenor are two of the most un-dynamic characters I've ever heard of. All the events that happen in the book are a little dull as well..."
2,Zacs,This is a horrible book for those who like science fiction and fantasy(like moi). It is just about how two people take a pilgrimage to a very far place and face lots of hardships along the way. They start with nothing but two horses but end up taking over 200 people in escort to the destination.
2,Book Review,"This book was very slow in the beginning, but as we got into it, it got better. It wasn't exciting and the beginning was dull. The only interesting thing was the people Elenor and Thomas met. The ending wasn't even interesting. It left you hanging, but not so much that you wanted there to be a sequal or anything. We DO NOT recommend this book."
2,Horrid Writing Style,"The synoposis was interesting, a female and male who were bethroted to eachother but don't like each other. Original, but the writing style was dissapointing. The plot was ruin for risking a good, clean, unique writing type. Style can make a bad plot good. Style can make a good plot go bad, as in this case."
2,cathedrals,"this is one of the more boring books i've read, which is saying something. the most exiting part is when a toddler is almost devoured by a wolf.some of it gets interesting(they have a good description of a cathedral)or when a man falls about 800 feet to his death. it's a typical book that your teacher would give to you for over-the-summer reading"
3,On the Road...,"This book comes so close to what the series should be, that it killed me how, by the time I reached it's final page, I was left with less enjoyment than when I had begun reading the book. Certain elements are dead on -- Bruce Banner, on the lamb -- ""wanted for a murder he didn't commit"" -- and his attempts to contain the raging beast within!But too many elements veer into comic-book cliches, complete with the ""revolving door into the after life"". Aspects that were probably intended to feel like ""horror"" and ""true crime"" influence, instead came across as typical superhero conundrums that leave you hanging (and assuming, ""Oh, he must just be setting something up, I'll just have to have enough faith to buy the next $30 collection,""), but I'm sorry, I'm not buying it."
1,Potassium exposed?,"Unfortunately this piece of fluff is more interested in promoting an agenda than providing solid scientific information for the reader. It promotes the intake of potassium without consideration of the problems for people who are taking medically prescribed medications for other conditions. It is unclear as to how much potassium you should take,how and when. Nor does it relate the connections with sodium and caffeine which the author seems to deem as bad without pointing out that sodium is necessary for life and none of the serious studies about caffeine have indicated a reason not to consume it in an intelligent manner."
1,not what we had in mind,"The book was for people who have low potassium amounts in their blood stream, my husband has to watch not to eat food high in potassium. the book did list foods high in potassium."
5,excellent tent,this tent works like a charm. easy to put up/ take down and fairly light weight. went camping on a beach with it and it held up to 20+ mph winds. I would definitely recommend this tent to a friend.
4,Kindle edition caveat emptor,"Chapter 5 contains a number of questionnaires. It is difficult to fill in the answers on the Kindle or to print out the questionnaires so that they can be answered off line. (As of now, the Kindle edition actually costs more than the paperback, as well.)"
3,"Not Bad, but nothing really new for me","I actually did an overnight sleep study. I fall asleep, just don't stay asleep. Didn't see anything in this book that really changed that, but definitely worth someone looking at if they have any sleep issues. I would just suggest checking out a library copy first before purchasing."
4,A great time saver (with Headphones or car adapter),"This ISpeak is a great program! I purchased the entire suite and love it. The voices are sometimes hard to understand, but you can change the speed at which they speak, the pitch and the actual voice! I recommend a car adapter for the sound or headphones for the best sound, since the voices aren't always loud enough, that is why the program is 4 not 5 stars (although with a better PDA it might be louder and clearer)."
3,More techical than I expected,"Storey's Guide to Feeding Horses was much more technical and scientific than I wanted or needed,although she does give some very good info, but the beginning of the book is really written for people aspiring to be professional equine nutrition specialists or scientists, NOT the average horse person just seeking basic info on feeding horses. Next time I will think twice before purchasing a book written by a Ph.D, as they don't write for the rest of us--they write to show off all their education and technical knowledge. I'm no dummy, but I can do without the highly scientific info. Just tell me that a horse's digestive system cannot handle this or that, and that's all I need to know--I don't need to know all the details of how and why. But if you are an equine vet or aspiring horse nutrition specialist, by all means, get this book. Perhaps the rest of the book is written in a more straighforward, non-technical way."
2,Almost but not quite...,"As another reviewer observed, the chain on this belt is short. It's not obvious from the pictures or the reviews just how short it is.The chain is too short to first load the belt, then put the belt on. Putting the belt on first and then loading lots of small plates is awkward. The plates are too small to rest on the ground (the short chain strikes again) so you kind of have to juggle them while you load them. Aggravating. Also, put a 25lb plate on and it might hit your groin.There are U-shaped connectors that attach the chain to the belt on one side and the chain to a clip on the other side. The U-shaped connector is of such a size and shape that it and the clip get locked together at a weird angle and it takes a bit of wrestling to unfreeze them.The quality of the rest of the belt is great though. If they would fix the chain length and the design of the U-shaped connectors, this belt could be a winner. As is, I would stay away unless you want to hack the chain yourself."
4,Dip belt,I purchased the belt to add weight to pull-ups and dips. I have no complaints at all about the belt. If you are looking to add 75+lbs then this belt isn't for you. The chain is a bit short so an improvement would be a slightly longer chain.
3,"If you're too happy, read this book!","With worlds falling to chaos all around you, this is not an uplifting read. It is an interesting story with an unusual plot, but has no characters to really feel sympathy or identify with. One really annoying thing about this book is the editing! Did anyone use spell check? If you're a die hard fantasy fan, then read this book. If not, don't."
5,Great product,I am writing this review over a year late but I can say this now- the seedhouse is still standing firm and we just went thorough Hurricane Sandy! It never budged! Works like a charm for getting seeds started and giving young plants extra time before transplanting.
1,"Crashes on Intel Mac OS X 10.4 MacBook Pro, AVOID",Basically unusable... crashes with Director Player error. No patches available from software company. AVOID for Mac OS X.
2,Could be Better,"Kaplan's 2007 Platinum Edition SAT ACT PSAT software is mediocre. What I found to be the most detracting was the quality of the user interface of the program. The program took up the entire screen, much like a video game, but only utilized about 50% of the screen space in the middle, placing a black rectangle of space around the edge. This was annoying to me, the programers could have simply made the program windowed, much like the window user interface of a web browser. Some of the explanations regarding multiple choice questions were poor, especially the chemistry and biology questions. All in all, I did not use this software as much as I had anticipated; it just wasn't the best way to prepare. I recommend sticking to the old fashion test prep books!"
1,Kaplan SAT Platinum does not work on OSX (10.4.11) PowerPC,"The software works except on a PowerPC running OS 10.4.11 with current flash player it does not work and crashes everytime you take diagnostic test, you get a Direct Player Error and freezes program and does not save your 30 min test. I called Topics Entertainment tech support and they said they are having problems and Kaplan is responsible for fixing and they have not. It is false advertising, they do not support Mac PowerPc version. Topic Tech Support said it has problems with PowerPC and should work with intel processor for Mac. This software ALSO does not work on OS X 10.5 Leopard, same error. I will try it on my Windows laptop and post an update if I can."
4,Crisp and Clean music - nice composition,Luckily I was not swayed by a reviewer with an axe to grind but no substantive feedback.I really like this album - having lived in the Southwest it does take me back to the subtle beauty of the desert and high plains. Several tracks also have a certain visceral power which grabs my attention when I listen.A definite welcome change from the Tangerine Dream genre. Give it a listen for yourself.
4,A little bit bland - but still excellent jazzy New Age!,"Listeners who enjoy this album should try ""The Private Music of Tangerine Dream."" I would call Patrick O'Hearns style ""Experimental Jazz-based New Age."" Similar to Tangerine Dream, but the sounds here are not so exotic. The whole album is good; the track ""Two Continents"" is excellent, ""Synergy"" is one of his melodically super-slow songs -- but not quite as excellent as the others because the melody does not dominate the background enough. Metaphor, Indigo, and Eldorado are my favorite albums of his (in order)."
2,Two Great Tracks- Hence two stars,"With the eception of perhaps ""Rivers Gonna Rise"", this is, for me, O'Hearn's weakest release. Too repetitive and atypically visionless. The exceptions being the title track and ""3 Circles"", two lilty and delicate little nocturnal masterworks. Beautiful! If only I could speak as well for the rest..."
5,On of Patrick's best works.,"Wow! What a powerful statement this CD makes. The dark overtones, smooth movement,and relaxing but stimulating synth textures, can get you lost in a world only limited by your imagination and the quality of your headphones. A must-have for any newage electronic music lover."
3,"Okay, but...","I should start by saying I am not rough on bags or baggage. The first day I used this bag, 3 of the main zipper pulls broke off in my hand while I was zipping the bag. Another has broken since then. I am making do as is, but that was super disappointing. Otherwise, it has been a good size for my laptop and other papers."
2,Underwear bulky in crotch,Well made and easier to tear along side seam when underwear needs to be changed. Good quality but way to bulky.
1,"There's frugal, and then there's FRUGAL","You know you are in trouble when the Frugster spells ""Tapas"" in the opening of the video as ""T-O-P-A-S""! I suppose this video would be educational for someone who wanted to learn what sort of items are served at a Tapas bar, but it has precious little in the way of actual instruction: ""put cheese cubes in a bowl"" is not real cooking."
3,It's okay,"Even at under $37, I would have passed on it had I seen it in a store clearance. IT is polyester and cotton and looks like polyester NOT silk. I will be machine-washing it on the hand wash cycle, not dry cleaning. The machine sewn embroidery is very well done. The colors are beige, medium lavender, chestnut brown and a nice green, in-between olive and grass green. It matches a set of green real silk sheets I have. Hopefully once I fill it w/ pillows and a comforter, it will look less cheap."
2,Okay but of limited interest,"Wolff began teaching a political science course, believing that government was justified. He wasn't too sure just *how* it could be justified, so he promised his students that he would find out by the end of the term. What he found out was that all arguments that attempt to justify government are flawed, and that moral autonomy requires anarchy. He does a good job presenting this argument, but his reliance on Kant's conceptions seems to me to make it of rather limited value, since most individuals do not find Kant persuasive. Even for someone interested in anarchism, Wolff's book is at best aleatory material."
5,Easy to use and provides a sufficient amount of examples,"This book was given to me as a gift in junior high school. It was and continues to be a great gift! I used it in high school and throughout college. I still refer to it once in a while. It is easy to use and provides a suffient amount of examples to meet your needs. It is easy to read, not too wordy in explanations, and it has a user-friendly format. I highly recommend it."
4,practical and direct to the point,This book has helped me with my college English papers. A very practical reference guide for English students. The book is also direct to the point that even my middle schooler used it for his English class.
2,Dusk made me sleepy...,"DUSK is usually the kind of book I would love. Dig the ideas, but the execution of it bored me after a while.I don't get all the high marks it is recieving. To each his own, I suppose. I found it quite slow, with no clear-cut, much-needed descriptions. Way too vague for my tastes.Not as good as Chris Golden."
3,Cover,"Well I really liked the cover. That is what made me purchase the book in the first place. I also like the author's attempt at being somewhat original. The promise of adult fantasy doesn't really hold up. Having some gory scenes and telling some of the story from the bad guy's point of view really doesn't make it all that dark. The writing is good, but not above average. The story tries hard, but the characters just aren't fleshed out enough and most of the book seems to be a setup for the next. I have liked Lebbon's horror a little more than his first attempt at fantasy. I'm on the fence with this one."
2,From Dusk to Yawn,"I finally found a copy of this novel at my local library, wanting to try out this writers new direction from horror to fantasy.Unfortunately this didn't quite live up to my personal standards, (not like seemingly others who gave this novel rave reviews!), but left me wondering what too many things looked like or were.Tim Lebbon leaves a reader to envision things to their satisfaction...not his. He is not clear on descriptions at all, making it hard for a reader to envision what the world and its environs look like.Characters were one-dimensional, for the most part. Not as riveting and well worked as some writers can do.But this world-building scenario, along with its concepts, was intriguing. Kinda reminded me of older Fred Saberhagen work.I don't know if I'll try this author's next fantasy installment. We'll see. Some authors improve as they go along."
3,"Good, but not great.","I have been hearing about Dusk and Dawn for years now. The author really hyped these books up. So I ordered a copy of Dusk and gave it a shot, being a fan of Mr. Lebbon's horror books. However, I was a little dissapointed. For the most part, the story held up well, but I have to admit it could have been a lot better. Lebbon doesnt give his characters enough space to breathe, so to speak, and they pretty one dimensional because of it. Also, there are several instances of the dialogue seeming almost forced (several pages without dialogue, and then a few one liners, but nothing memorable). Other than that, the world Noreela is intriguing, and I wouldnt be object to try out Dawn and see how it goes. Good try, Mr. Lebbon."
5,Great book!,"I read a lot of horror novels, and don't venture into the realm of fantasy often, but this book is definitely worth it. Lebbon is an exceptional author who doesn't pull punches.I highly recommend this book."
1,"""This is fantasy for grownups."" C'mon give me a break!","This book and its sequel werent what I had been expecting. All my expectations in both books fell very short. I still do not understand what was so dark about the storyline. If the author was a horror writer before writing this photo copy of every other fantasy story, then what happened? The text wasnt very descriptive, the villians werent very scary either. The heros were paper thin and very mundane. The ONLY reason I finished reading both books was the fact that I pumped myself up about the story and waited to buy both books so I could read the WHOLE story. Oh and please someone tell me why everyone and their brother's sister is giving this book and Dawn raving reviews. Please"
1,A Fantasy for Grown-ups?,"Billed as a fantasy for grown-ups, this book came off the shelf fast for me!...Instead of a well-developed story, I paid for a tedious random world that the author cannot show enough contempt for, filled with contemptible characters...Cynical and unredeemable, this is not the adult world that I want to spend time in!...But of course, the billing might apply only to the number of times the author managed to put the word ""cock"" on each page, not to the quality of the writing....drivel...stay away!"
4,Practical Information,"Nick Morgan does a good job at presenting why and when certain techniques in speech delivery and audience centered speaking work. His contention that all opportunities to speak should be life changing events (small or large) for your audience is one that I agree with and he may very well convince you of the same. The section on the importance of rehearsal helped change my approach.Why not five stars? He didn't quite make me feel like his book was aimed at changing the world of public speaking.However, I recommend the book as a must read for those who want to hone their skills, or develop new ones. Worth every penny, and more.Buy it."
1,Too Long,"Great points made but the author takes the long road to get to every point. This book should have been about 100 pages. You get the feeling while reading this that the author had to reach a certain word quota. If you have the time or like ""wordiness"", this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away."

5,Best matches of 2006,I think WWE should come out with a DVD with the best matches of 2006 like they did for 2001. Heres what matches i think should be on there:WWE No Way OutWorld Heavyweight ChampionshipKurt Angle vs. UndertakerWWE BacklashTriple Theat WWE Championship MatchJohn Cena vs. Edge vs. Triple HWWE Wrestlemania 22World Heavyweight Championship Triple ThreatKurt Angle vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey MysterioWWE New Years RevolutionElimination Chamber for the WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena vs. Carlito vs. Kane vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Masters vs. Kurt AngleWWE SummerslamI-Quit MatchRic Flair vs. Mick FoleyWWE UnforgivenTLC Match for the WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena vs. EdgeWWE Unforgiven2-on-3 Hell in a CellDegeneration X vs. The McMahons and Big ShowECW One Night StandWWE ChampionshipJohn Cena vs. RVDWWE ArmageddonLast Ride MatchUndertaker vs. Ken KennedyWWE ArmageddonLadder Match for the WWE Tag Team TitlesHardy Boyz vs. MNM vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor vs. London/Kendricks
1,"If only WCW was still alive, WWE wouldn't be nothing.","I admit that WWE well, WWF was great back in the classic days with much more wrestling than there todays stuff like adding trash like drama cutscenes, a soap opera show like case but ever since WCW had action back in the 90's, I was urged to see them more than what WWE had & I went to WCW more times than WWE cause clearly WCW had it all, but in 2001, that all changed when WCW lost when they've totally kicked WWE's [...].If WCW wasn't bankrupt & lost money, WWE wouldn't be the same, damn it.Wrestling is dead, period."
2,Dissapointed,"Why why why would someone write a book of this nature based off Visual Basic ? C++ is by far the most prevalent and useful language for the vast majority of people who would be programming. This wouldn't be so bad if they concentrated on the concepts and steps, instead of describing every line of Visual Basic in excruiating detail.Apart from the language issue, this book wasn't much use to me. That being said - it was much better then the companion book I also purchased "" MS Windows Media Resource Kit"", which was just a high level overview."
3,Dictionary yes - Phrasebook NO,"I purchased this book with the idea that it would contain many phrases to use while traveling in Turkey. There are very few. My travel guide contains many more phrases and I'm certain a Collins dictionary would have short phrases next to each term.While I don't disagree with the quality of the cover and the dictionary as described by other reviewers (though I do expect short phrases next to terms), this is inadequate as a phrasebook."
2,Not good for traveler's Turkish,"Please take my advice and get the Lonely Planet or other language guide for Turkish. As a traveler who is not learning the full language, or even sentence structure, during a shortish trip, this book won't be helpful. If you're learning Turkish for real, this might be good as it's organized Turkish-->English and English-->Turkish like a dictionary. However, I just wanted to look up phrases for situations: i.e. when purchasing a train ticket; at the restaurant; at the market; and this guide is horrible for that."
3,Stone is small,The stones have a beautiful color and sparkle. The stones are small. I woud not recommend these earrings for an adult.
5,As Good As It Gets,"We read some bad reviews about the Cuisinart Elite series concerning push buttons that wear through and the hard to clean bowl. This machine had nothing but high praise so that's what we purchased. The DFP-14 is everything we loved about our old DLC-7, but better because of more power. It even uses the same tools as our old machine which was a major plus to us since we had lots of accessories. We whole heartedly recommend this machine and believe it will last at least as long as our 25+ year old DLC-7."
4,Love it!,"I love this food processor with one exception - I wish it had speed control instead of just on & off. Otherwise, it is great."
2,Not nearly as good as they used to be...,"Over about a 25 year span I've owned 4 Cuisinart food processors (which I mainly gave away when I got a new color or larger size). The early models were great. This one was not. After less than two years use the blade developed a hairline crack on the underside which gradually widened. The bowl was looking a little worn as well. We don't use this more than 2-3 times a week and we hand wash the blade, bowls, etc. Faced with $40 for a new blade I started researching and found others who were long-time Cuisinart users that were dissatisfied with the quality of the new products. I switched to Kitchen Aid - and we really like it. It seems very well made and the blades are incredible. I would not buy a Cuisinart food processor without looking at the Kitchen Aid first. I think it may be a much better product at this point."
4,Professional grade food processor with stylish appearance,"I purchased this brand and particular model of food processor after a good deal of consideration. It is the same exact food processor that I use every day at our restaurant. My partner and I are chef/owners of a popular bistro and we are constantly using this machine as an important production tool.It's powerful motor and large work bowl afford great versatility in recipe production.It is both durable and effective and takes a beating in the kitchen getting multiple uses and washes through a commercial dishwasher.It may seem like overkill to employ the same machine at home, but it's very stylish(black and brushed stainless) and fits well on the counter under a row of cabinets.I would also rather have a food processor that's a little bigger than I need rather than one that is too small.Great machine-highly recommended for the serious cook."
5,Great Machine!,"If you leave this food processor on your counter, you will find many more uses for it,chopping,mixing,shredding,pureeing, and many other preparation procedures. Easy clean-up also."
4,Sana the Great,"Sana is an amazing character that believes that she can do anything. The fun part is that she pretty much can. Sana is the star of a show called childs toy.Shes the type of girl who can stand up to the class bully with no fear. That horrid bully is Akito. Akito is the ""monkey leader"". Akito is one sceaming boy that makes the teachers cry. Of course our young 11 year old heroine, with an agent, is there to save the day. How will she do it? Read the book and find out."
5,Perversion of psychiatry in Cuba,"This slim tome can be read in one or two settings - if one can stand the poignant drama and the horror stories recounted in the pages of this book.The Politics of Psychiatry only came to my attention because its documentation value was mentioned in two special issues of The New American magazine chronicling the Elián González saga (March 13, 2000 and May 22, 2000), the story of six-year-old Cuban boy who has been a point of contention between the Cuban-American community in Miami who wants him to stay in American freedom, on the one hand, and the U.S. and the communist Cuban government, which want him returned to Cuba, on the other...Among the 27 cases cited in this book, a clear pattern emerged. After arrest, they were usually taken to Villa Marista State Security Headquarters for harsh interrogation...Yes, psychiatric prisoners underwent unspeakable horror, but you must read this book..."
1,not much there,"I have this series on tape and love watching it. I had hoped for a music CD, but this one lacks much of the best music from the show. There are no score pieces and due to its lack of Grant Lee Phillips ""Cathain"" - a center piece to the series - I wouldn't waist your money."
1,This was Witchblade?,"A great disapointment! There was a lot of great music in the series that I was hoping to hear that isn't in this cd. Most of these songs I don't remember hearing (and I watched it many times) so if they were there they were very short or in the second season (which wasn't as good musically). There are a couple of songs people have been dying to get - the remix of ""Cry, Little Sister"" and ""Sarah"" - that aren't available anywhere else but I don't think the versions on this album are the ones we wanted to hear."
5,Mandatory book for anyone working with signals and transform,"This is truly an excellent book to quickly recap the essentials of signals and their manipulations. By working along with the exercises, I was quickly able to come back to speed on such important issues such as convulutions, Fourier Transforms, and LTI systems."
4,Great to assist with signal analysis,"I am currently taking my first semester in systems and signal analysis. While the subject matter is a little intimidating in terms of math, this outline cuts through the generalities and provides great, worked out, stepped out examples for everything from the basic properties of LTI systems to convolution, laplace transforms, z-transforms, fourier analysis, and space state analysis. Between the class text and this outline, I am very well prepared for future classes in signals and systems. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels they may need a little help with signal analysis, especially since the price is right."
3,Hard to understand,"I usually like all the schaums outlines because they are very down to earth, but this one was a lot more confusing, even the solved out problems tended to skip steps or not explain clearly what was going on. Overall it's a pretty decent book."
5,Great book,"Great book, highly recommended. Can be even used as a text book. You should have this one, if you are a undergraduate EE student."
4,Great study guide,"This has been a very useful book for me so far. I use it to review for my Signals and Systems class and it has great summaries of properties and transforms, for example. The only thing that is missing is a more comprehensive section on sampling and filters."
3,"If you're serious, buy it anyway...","If you're struggling like I did in the course then the problems don't offer enough detail to help.The explanations are okay and a lot of times the schaum's outlines offer a different way of thinking about a problem than your text which might help.But if you're serious about doing well, you should buy it anyway, because it won't hurt to have it."
2,Signals and Systems,"Not one of Schaums good books. Skips too many steps in solving problems. Other EE students and also complained about this one. Usually Schaums a safe bet, just not this time."
4,A quarterly periodical on the topic of brain science...,"Contents of this periodical include:""Two Smart Alecks in Cambridge"" by Victor K. McElheny""From the Gene to the Brain: 1953-2003"" by Samuel H. Barondes""The Telltale Hand: How Writing Reveals the Damaged Brain"" by Marc J. Seifer""Brainsick: A Physician's Journey to the Brink"" by Leon E. Rosenberg""Patients Have Been Too Patient with Basic Research"" by Ralph M. Steinman with Maia Szalavitz""Book Excerpt: Worried Sick"" by Bruce S. McEwenBook reivews by Temple Grandin, Michele S. Garfinkel, and Pierce J. Howard"
4,Easy to read,"Bought this watch to wear on my days off and vacation since my old one is getting pretty banged up. Face is large enough that it is very easy to read and is very easy to set time. Date is a pretty easy to set also but can be a bit finicky. I do wish that the date was a little bit bigger but otherwise have no complaints. I have an average sized wrist and fits just a tad snug. Probably the best part of this watch is that its not digital. No more pushing button A five times, B twice, do the hokey pokey, etc. I can set this without having to refer to a 20 page manual. If you just wanted a simple watch that looked decent, is easy to read/set, keeps time accurately, and should last a few years, for the price it's definately worth it."
4,Nice,"Nice looking watch with a nice, big face and clear numbers. The band is a bit smaller than I thought but hopefully it will expand enough without being too tight."
3,Minor problems-a warning to older folks,"Date is hard to set.More importantly, watchband was incorrectly assembled--it was fixable, but shouldn't have needed fixing.I'm not returning it, but older people with poor vision or arthritis might find this watch unusable, due to these problems. Do not give as a gift to older people."
2,i like tna,1st match kaz matt bentley and christopher daniels vs 3live crew winners 3live crew. 2nd match primetime vs sonjay dutt winner primetime. 3rd match kid kash vs dustin rhodes winner dustin rhodes. 4th match raven vs eric watts winner eric watts. 5th match scott hall vs jeff hardy very short and boring winner jeff hardy. 6th match monty brown vs kevin nash vs ddp winner monty brown. 7th match amw vs team canada winners amw. 8th match chris sabin vs aj styles vs petey wiliams winner aj styles. 9th match jeff jarett vs monty brown winner jeff jarett.
1,I watched it,"I recently watched this PPV and I still dont get TNA. Its like a bunch of former WCW stars got together after being let go by WWE and started TNA. Jarrett is the Triple H of the company and always held onto the title in the early days, giving it up a few times for a short period of time. Scott Hall was in bad shape and should of even wrestled in the match. The early days of TNA was like trying to revive WCW. They had Vince Russo, Mike Tenay, DDP, Raven, Randy Savage, Dustin Rhodes, and other various stars past there prime. Expect Raven, who is still fun to watch but sad to see the shape he is in circa 2007. The X-Divison kept the company afloat and the hardcore matches with Abyss, Raven, and Jeff Hardy were also fun to watch. TNA is a great company and has a bright future."
1,tna...,TNA SUCKS!!! WWE WILL ALWAYS BE THE BIGGER WRESTLING BRAND! TNA IS JUST A TRASH DUMP FOR EVERY RELEASED WWE STAR WHO STILL THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE IN THE PRO WRESTLING BUSINESS
5,THE ULTIMATE X IS ONE OF THE BEST MATCHES OF THE YEAR.,The Ultimate X: AJ Styles vs Petey Williams vs Chris Sabin is aFive ***** star match One of my all time favorite matches in TNA history. This is why every body is taking about TNA because of matches like this one. The X Division is all that and more withgreat high spots.AJ Styles is the best Wrestler today Williams and Sabin are not for behind.
3,C+ material at best....,"I will give them credit, the Ultimate X match was passable and the tag team match was alright, but Joe TNA guy, why don't you actually get your head out of your A** and take a look around because that ppv was not better than every single WWE ppvs of the past year. Vengeance, Royal Rumble, WM 21, Summerslam, Taboo Tuesday, and ECW One Night Stand [WHICH WAS A WWE PPV] blow this peice of mediocre crap out of the water. Props to TNA guys trying to make something ""Unique"" but give me Batista/HHH hell in a cell anyday over this.Oh, by the way, F*ck you all...... TNA SUCKS.... Long Live WWE."
4,Speed of Light,"I've read some very good and very bad reviews of Ixlandia. It follows the ""Midsummer Century"" formula so to speak. It begins with soft jazzy music then takes off into space. You need a stereo that will handle high volume for a song like ""The Tachyon Directive"". You need the right time and place to appreciate this CD. Alone, inside a dark house, on a quiet night, with the volume up high. Now listen to ""Tachyon Directive"". If you don't think the sound is awesome then this CD is not for you."
4,"great for cold frame, not so great for seed starter.","I found this to work well as a cold frame. As a seed starter (which is in the title of the product), not so great, since it really can heat up in there. It has to be monitored very closely. Even with the flaps rolled up and the shade mesh on it some seeds fried."
5,excellent,"This was great, came packed compactly and is very easy to use. We love that it is exactly what we expected and works very well. Is durable as well."
4,Not Bad,I got this to protect my herbs during the winter. It works fine; I just wish it didn't get so narrow at the top. I would have liked it to be a little wider to accommodate bushier plants.
3,Smaller usable space than I expected,A portion of the space is unusable. It appears in the picture that you can plant a lot more tomatoes than what you can. I won't know for a couple months how well it works though.
5,Blue Seed Vol. 6,I loved this movie! The characters are so real and they really make me laugh. Momiji is a really cool person and Kusinagi is one of my absolute favorite characters in any Anime movie!
4,Hilarious,"Remember Sakura? Guess what, she's back in a way you only got a glimsp of before. Now she gonna cause some trouble both in Momiji's life and Kusinagi's. I wouldn't recommended this for anyone under 13 though because there are a few scenes of anime girls in undergarments. No nudity but still. Overall though it was funny as heck."
3,"Good company, average product.","When I initially received the item, it was a little 'flimsier' than I expected. The appearance was great but the leather panel came off of the stainless steel plate to which it was attached with foam tape.Favors by Serendipity, the company who supplied the case, was wonderful. I called them to inform them that the item was defective, and they promptly sent me a new one along with a postage-paid return envelope for the defect. The new case has been fine so far. If you like the look of this item, I would recommend it."
3,Black Leather Card Case,"The price for this item is reasonable, but I would have paid more to have (and I know this is going to sound picky but ...) the engraving be properly centered on the name plate and for the clasp to be stronger.My husband was able to bend the clasp so that the lid closes more firmly now. I was very pleased that from the time I ordered the item to the time it was shipped, only took about a week.This card case will do very nicely until I can afford the sterling silver one from Tiffany's...."
1,BUSINESS CARD CASE NIGHTMARE,They got the engraving wrong 3 separate times !! The hinges are also cheaply made - in fact the whole product is very flimsy. Do yourself a favor and buy one of these from a different company. Got a full refund (including shipping) after the third screw-up.
2,"Good service, not so great product",Service was great. The product arrived on time with the correct engraving. The product however is very flimsy. Turns out it's Chinese made. I recently bought another business cardholder for only $2 more than the price of this one and you can't even begin to compare the two. I don't expect mine to last long. The only plus is the personalized engraving. I won't recommend this product to anyone.
3,Good product,I was pleased with this product. The engraving came out just as I ordered and the holder was good quality. It was shipped in a timely manner also.
2,Expensive investment with risk,"I have a Suunto Vytec that I bought a few years ago with the transmitter which I loved until it died!! The depth gauge just went bizerk during a dive (reading 20' deeper than I was) and never went back to normal when I got out of the water. Apparently that is a known ""issue"" however there is nothing that Suunto would do for me, there is no fix, so now my expensive dive computer is basically a paper weight or hockey puck but cannot be used as a dive computer or even a dive gauge. I find it amazing that the manufacturer doesn't stand by there products at all given that the issue was theirs and not user generated or even wear/tear."
5,Obvious quality,"I thought they had sent me the wrong filter because the Bosch filter was so much larger than the Fram filter on the car. But, it fits perfectly. After thinking about it, the quality is obvious and I regret having used the Fram filters all these years."
4,good hat,"I pack this in my work bag for extra sun protection on my lunch time, or during my commute. It holds up after being smushed inside my tote. It fits just right for me (I have a small-ish size head), and I like that it's plain."
2,Poor Quality,"I have been using this keyboard for a little over a week and the letters are already fading off. I can barely see the letter ""L"" and there are quite a few letters that are faded. It's very disappointing because the keyboard is very comfortable and I like the way it looks."
5,"Great Fun -- a great, old-fashioned American yarn","I just finished reading Jumpin' Jimminy and enjoyed immensely. It is a great, old-fashioned American yarn populated with larger than life characters. Skole tells a great story and this book promises a rollicking and relaxing evening or two between its covers. I dare anyone to read Jumpin' Jimminy and not conclude, as I did, that this would make a great, very funny movie."
1,Stay away from this !!,"I didn't purchase this through Amazon but my experience may be valuable to anyone thinking of buying it. I bought this solely to convert my family VHS tapes (created with my VideoCam) to DVD. It did a good job for the first ten tapes. Then every single tape after that gave me an error that said I was trying to copy commercially protected tapes. I couldn't convert anymore family tapes. I called the Sylvania help desk but they were helpless. I returned the unit and ordered another one, hoping I had a defective unit. I got the new unit and the convert failed on the first tape. Not only that, any tape I tried to play was unviewable, the tapes flickered constantly. The same tapes played fine on my other VCR player.This unit apparently has some kind of bug in its design and also a problem in its tape playback. Do not purchase it if you are looking to convert your VHS tapes to DVD."
1,Sylvania model #POS,"I didn't buy mine through Amazon, but I want to take every opportunity to warn people away from the rip-off that is this piece of junk. Like the other reviewer, we began converting VHS tapes to DVDs. We at least got further along than he/she did, but it eventually stopped recognizing blank DVDs. Well, we thought, at least we still have the DVD player functionality. Wrong. The machine now refuses to play any commercial DVD with copy protection (read: 99% of them).If you're driving along the I-5 near San Diego sometime soon and you see one of these fly out of a car window, honk and say ""hello."""
1,"The DVD player works, but don't try and dub VCRs","Like the other reviewers, I have never gotten a single VCR to DVD dub to work. I have owned this for several years and the DVD player portion has worked OK. But now when I finally got around to use the record/dub features, it is useless. My Memorex -R 16x DVDs always give a ""not a recordable disk"" error. I tried a bunch and now give up."
1,Not a good value at $999,"Although Amazon offers this CBT at almost $300 less than buying direct, PC Age does not justify $1000 for this CBT that is low on features like printing, keyboard functions, etc. I have also purchased SYBEX and MS Press study kits, a much better investment. Difficult to navigate through this training and the only thing that you can print is your test score. The tests lack clarity and accuracy. Many sources out there for less money. This CBT is the equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation with NO print functions."
4,good fun,"well made outer and inner bladder, inflates and deflates pretty quickly and doesn't take on a lot of water like some other towables...a little small for us big kids, but perfect for the kids and the teens love it too..."
3,Not for me,"It would be wonderful, I think, for kids. But for me (over 65) the red portion does not have a big enough circumference so that I would sit up higher on the ""hot dog"" portion, thus allowing my joints to bend at a less acute angle. With the small circumference my knees and hips are forced to bend too much. It was cute."
5,"Not only a lot of fun, but durable","Fisher price really has a hit here.THese pieces are so durable and designed pretty much perfectly!My daughter loves the small playsets. I love that Sweet streets are not overpopulated with tiny flimsy items. the baby animals in this set are just so cute!!! the feeder even dispenses ""feed"" when the lever is pushed! the colors and design are perfect!And not only do all the pieces fit inside for storage, but they added a handle so the kids can easily take this from place to place!"
4,Shatner has created a fast paced entertaining journey.,"This is the first Shatner book I read. I have read the first 5 and liked them all. I stopped reading them when I became obsessed with the new Star Wars expanded universe following Timothy Zahn's trilogy about the further adventures of Luke and friends. If you saw FIFTH ELEMENT I imaged that Shatner's Jake Cardigan was a futuristic scruffy, PI more like Bruce Willis than Stacey Keach. When the TV series started starring Greg Evigan I thought Evigan did a fine job.Shatner and friends have done a great job creating this futuristic world where Tek theatens to do real harm to humanity. Cardigan, after spending years in a deep freeze coma prison is released and goes to work for a detective agency. The TV series followed the books fairly closely as Shatner was a big part of both, but the books had differences. Check these book out if you can find them. They are a fun read."
3,Good work by Goulart,"I enjoy the TekWar novels very much. Ron Goulart's stories are crisply written and smartly paced.I mean...you guys all know Shatner only provided the plots, right? Ron Goulart is the one deserving of your praise here. Anytime you see a book with William Shatner as the author, go check the acknowledgments. When he thanks an author for their ""assistence"", that's usually the person actually doing the writing."
4,Good Read,"I first read this years ago and I remembered enjoying it. So, since it was on sale, I got it for my Kindle. While it's not the best story ever written, it's certainly an entertaining mixture of mystery and action that has you on the edge, wondering what will happen next. The world Shatner has created is an interesting one, filled with all kinds of cool high-tech gizmos and whatnot that Sci-Fi fans tend to enjoy. It's certainly better than Shatner's attempts to write Star Trek, IMHO."
4,"Fast pace, captivating novel!","Great novel by William Shatner. I really enjoyed the plot & even though I read it over 10 years ago I find ""Tek"" is actually becoming a reality today with so many people hooked on things like social media and no longer able to communicate effectively & build ""real relationships"" with people.For anyone who likes Sci-fi this is a good read and will make you think of how you use your computer today..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Tekwar was almost passable. A futuristic story based around a conflict between drug dealers of the substance Tek, and the detective/cop types that try and stop them. With very human androids, to boot.A cop that had been framed for such a drug deal is reactivated out of his statis prison and given a mission to find a missing man."
1,"Can't act, can't sing, now we know Shatner can't write","Keep trying Bill. One of these days, you'll find your niche. Have you considered a job that doesn't involve an audience?OK, I should be embarrassed to have read this. I'm going to claim the ""train wreck"" defense and say I just couldn't avert my eyes. But it really is awful. Even rabid trekkies would have a hard time wading through this I think."
5,Comedy at its finest,"What more can I say, than Bud and Lou are the templates of some of the greatest comedians today. My kids watched this DVD and immediately found a common connection with the comedians they laugh at today. My Husband and I have plenty of memories of Bud and Lou and find it a true pleasure getting the opportunity of having this on a easily obtainable and affordable DVD special."
5,The Flamboya Tree: Memories of a Mother's Wartime Courage,We were bowled over by this book! Clara Kelly presents vivid and heart rending images of the heroic acts of her mother to save her children from the devastating conditions in a Japanese concentration camp during WWII. This tribute to her mother also reveals the tenacity of the author and her older brother under unbelievably inhumane conditions. We will read it again.
5,Fantastic account of a horrendous period that deserves to be recounted,Sadly few have learnt or understood what transpired in the Dutch East Indies during WW2--the proof is the opening sentence by her grandmother...many still today are ignorant and would rather forget.Bravo Clara Olink Kelly for having the courage to write and document your story. It is a wonderful testament to your mother and her courage to keep her children safe and sound in the most unbelieveable conditions. Some passages are difficult but must be read. Many thanks for a wonderful eye-opening story.
4,Tough material to read but important,Very interesting (but incredibly sad) to learn about the Dutch settlers who were put in concentration camps during WWII. I am glad that I learned of these atrocities but cannot say it was an enjoyable book. The book wasn't super engaging as it was more of a factual account of what this particular family endured. Still it is important to read these types of books so we will hopefully be better people in the future.
2,"If You Are Buying it For a Car Seat, Save Your Money","Good idea, but does not work on car seats. As soon as you sit on it in the car it sinks down and will not swivel. This may work on hardwood seats but if you are wanting to use it in a car I can't recommend it at all."
3,Good idea but....,"Great idea, but it hasn't worked out. My mom has to be helped into the seat from her walker. I thought this product would help easily swivel her around so her legs would be straight in front of her and her feet on the car floor. But it's more work to try to position her on this cushion in such a way that she's sitting right on it, and I still have to move her legs around. No help. Also tried it on her chair. But it turns out to not be stable enough to safely seat her on it on the chair. And she doesn't trust it."
2,Non swivel seat,Might work well on a hard bench or chair but not on any soft or plush seat or chair Thank goodness it was only $7 as it goes on garage sale this weekend.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"i WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:1. CONSIDERING I'M PAYING EXTRA FOR CHRISTMAS WRAPPING, THE ITEMWAS NOT CHRISTMAS WRAPPED. A FEEBLE ATTEMT WAS MADE BYPLACING THE ITEM IN A BLUE BAG WITH A YELLOW TIE-ON.2. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THAT THIS ITEM WAS NOT DESIGNEDFOR BUCKET SEATS.I HAD ORDERED TWO ITEMS AND BOTH HAVE BEEN RETURNED."
3,Great idea with a design flaw,"I investigated several designs of Swivel Seat Cushion for our minivan before choosing this one. The van has bucket seats in the front row. Now for the good and the bad of it. Because of the bucket seat, the Swivel Cushion did not swivel to help him get his legs into the van. The bucket was just a little bit too deep and the swivel simply did not swivel.Now for the good part of this Swivel Seat Cushion. We always use it to get my husband into the van. It negates the bucket seat. The cushion makes him sit up a bit higher and consequently he doesn't sit in the recess of the bucket seat. He just has to maneuver himself to sit himself a couple of inches higher. Then we position him onto the center of the Seat Cushion.He likes sitting up a bit higher and the ease of getting him out of the van is great."
2,Not good for what I intended,"I needed something to hold up to water. The description does not give details one way or the other. I suppose I should have looked for something like ""able to withstand water use."""
5,Just the ticket!,Works great for my 90 year old Mom with compression fractures in her back. This eliminates the twisting motion that is so difficult for her. I bought one for the car and one for the dining room chair. They are quite sturdy.
1,Swivel Cushions,"I'm very disappointed......I never received this product. I e-mailed Allegro Medical and got not response. Amazon A-Z Guarantee gave me my money back and I ordered the cushions,from another company, and have already received them and have been using them. I had no idea they were back ordered, from Allegro, until I got this e-mail yesterday."
2,Not a good gift,"I gave this to my 81 year old father. He is about 6 foot and 220 lbs. He could not use it in his Chevy SUV because it was too tall and didn't rotate well. He said it was uncomfortable. So now it gathers dust. He did say that is was ""thoughtful"". Nice!"
4,Very good. Handy and works well.,"The seat is lightweight and works well in helping an individual swivel out of a car seat. Recommend it certainly to anyone having loss of mobility in lower limbs. Color, too, blended in nicely."
1,Very uncomfortable,"The swivel cushion is a good idea, but it is so uncomfortable to sit on. The seat is hard. It would seem that it could have a soft seat & yet swivel."
3,Swivel seat cushion,"Though I think this is a good product, it doesn't work real well in a car. The structure of the car seat, in most cars, is such that the item is not configured to be of help. It works great on a kitchen chair, or stable chair within the home, but otherwise is not useful."
3,SWIVEL SEAT,"IT'S OKAY TO USE FOR SHORT TRIPS TO THE DOCTOR OR GROCERY STORE,ETC, BUT VERY HARD TO SIT ON FOR LONG DISTANCE SO IT HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT FROM UNDER THE ELDERLY PERSON FOR A TRIP."
2,Didn't really swivel,I brought this as a gift for a disabled family member and she stated it was hard and didn't really swivel. She had a problem still getting in and out of the car.
5,Multi-functional,This was a gift for my mother who needs a little help getting in and out of cars. It works so well she uses it in the house on kitchen and dining room chairs as well.
4,Duro-Med Deluxe Swivel Seat Cushion,Purchased for a friend's father who is having mobility issues. This items makes it easier for him to get in and out of the van and truck.
2,Swivel with Care,"Could be a good product, does not work well for a person with limited mobility (advanced Parkinson's) or with my car. The height of the cushion adds to the difficulty of climbing into the car. Almost impossible to SLIDE onto the car seat and on top of the swivel seat and be in the right position to swivel. User must be able to sit squarely on top of the swivel seat - which my husband cannot. I would not recommend to anyone wheelchair bound needing moderate assistance with getting into a car."
4,a life saver,"I bought this for my mother, who has a broken hip and has difficulty getting in and out of the car. This swivel seat sits well in the car seat and is durable and moves easily--much better than another brand I purchased previously. It has helped her immensely. The only drawback is that it isn't that comfortable for long drives."
4,"Good, not great","This seat was bought for my husband who was ready to undergo back surgery. We thought it would make it easier to get in and out of the car. Unfortunately we didn't think it thorough --the swivel can't swivel in a bucket seat. (We have a Subaru Forester.)However, I use it in the driver's seat to raise it up , so it isn't going to waste. I could have used a plain old cheaper pillow for that, but this is OK. I also am thinking of using it on a plain kitchen chair . It should come in handy after that surgery. It won't work easily in a recliner or other deep cushion such as a sofa."
4,Getting in and out gets easier!,My husband really likes this 'booty lazy-Susan'. It's a big help for someone with back trouble. My neighbor craves this one because it has good padding on the seat.Just remember to keep the seat back far enough that you are able to swing your knees under the steering wheel.
3,"Great for a flat chair, not the car","This is an excellent product, just doesn't work well on, at least our car seats. Because of the slant of the seat toward the back the cushion sticks and does not turn like we would like it to so aren't using it. Does work better in the back but still not good. On a flat chair in the house it works beautifully. Would be great in place of a swivel dest chair."
3,works great except in and SUV,"This seat works exactly like they say it does, except... if you have an SUV it may make the seat too high for a normal height person to get in. My husband is 5' 9 1/2"" and has had bi-lateral hip replacements. We thought this would be just the thing; but, we have a Huyandi Santa Fe and it makes the seat to high to use properly."
4,swivel cushion works,"Hi, this cushion really works and helps if you have mobility issues and if the chair is firm and has no arms. I recommend it."
4,nice product,"I purchased this for my mother, but may get one for myself. It makes you sit a little higher and gives you the ease of getting in and out of the car."
2,Not for bucket seats.,Well made but does not turn well on bucket seats. If you put something under it to lift it it will then turn well but causes the user to feel somewhat unbalanced. A version of this item needs to be designed to fit into a bucket seat.
2,covrtworld,"I'm sure this product has sold many times over but according to my parents, in their 90's, it was uncomfortable to use and didn't conform to their car seat. Disapointed."
2,Don't be swiveled by this product...,"I tried using these in the car, but the top cover would keep peeling off. Then if you sit on them for any length of time whilstdriving it was causing me to have a foot cramp on my left leg. Removing the cushion solved the problem. The only advantage in the car I could perceive is that you sit higher, but when you get out you hit your head on the door jam. That should have knockedsome sense into me, but it didn't.. They work good on regular bar stools where you have a flat surface. I guess I could use themfor frizbees or something. If anybody wants these I will sell them for half price if you can swivel on that. They'll probably end upin the local thrift shop one of these days....."
5,great swivel seat,well if you have a bad back this is for you go get it it works great if you have a bad back go for it
3,Not good for what I bought it for,I bought it for my mother to help her get in and out of the car... She says it doesn't really rotate much or help. She did say it makes her car seat a little more comfortable so not a total waste.
2,Wish it worked better,Wish is worked better getting in and out of a car seat. Good idea but hard to use in a car any other place sure it would work well.
2,Doesnt work for most cars,Actually I am not happy at all with this product and have it wrapped ready to ship back. It only will work on older cars that have the bench seat or a station wagon type with seat across. I tried it in my Ford Taurus and 2 family members cars and it doesnt work at all. Most cars have seats that the back of the seat tilts downward and so the cushion doesnt swivel at all. Most cars dont have a flat seat they have contoured and/or sides that cushion outwards for comfort. That makes for an uneven fit and no swivel action. My mother is only 110 pounds and couldnt get ot to work at all.
5,Great Product!,"Made it so much easier to get in and out of the car with a broken ankle and cast, but I will keep it in the car, as my skirts don't twist when I enter, and I can enter like a lady with my legs together and just swivel around."
3,swivel around,"Works great with regular chairs, like a dining chair,for those that have difficulty with mobility. Didn't work too well in the car as it was a bit too wide for the countoured seat and didn't swivel easily."
4,This is a back saver,I am my mothers caregiver. She has Parkinsons and getting her from place to place many times a day was throwing my back out. with this product the transfer are much easier on both of us. she stands on the center and I control the spin with my foot.It also works well in a car seat as long as it is not a bucket seat. In a bucket seat it tends to bind a little and requires some effort to get it to turn.We also use it on the dining room chairs and again it works well. it has a slip resistant pad on the bottom which works well except when it gets wet then it will lose its grip.The cover is removeable and washes nicely the foam pad also blots clean. I find it is well worth the price and I would buy it again.I have recomended it to a number of people already.
4,Swivel seat cushion,"Our friend has limited use of his legs, including the thigh muscles. This really works well for getting him seated in the car. He just backs up to the front seat from his walker and sits down. I can turn the seat to face the front. So much easier for him and me!"
2,Not helpful,It was a medical article...but not what I was looking for. And I had to pay for it before I could even review whether or not it would be helpful. Waste of my money!
1,do not buy,"With a young family, we were excited about this product because of the added safety of the sewn on spring cover. However, after ONLY 1 YEAR the cover has been stretched out and will not stay over the springs. The cover comes up and is LESS SAFE than its counterparts that are not sewn. Worked for one year and now has to be thrown away - such a waste."
1,Don't buy!,"Thought this was a neat idea w/o the springs. Setup was tough, but manageable. After 10 days of enjoyment, we had some wind. Not a storm mind you, just some wind. We had the sides. It blew over and bent in half! They don't stand behind product and won't refund money. Very dissapointed. Trampoline should not just bend in half so easily. Material it was made out of was too flimsly and light."
2,Durability,"This trampoline has been a real disappointment for our family. It is less than two years old and has already completely lost its spring. The straps that hold the jumping surface are all stretched out. The kids complain that it no longer has any spring. I will be contacting the manufacturer today to see how well they will stand by their product. If they don't, I would not recommend that anyone purchase a trampoline with this design. Our friends have a trampoline with a spring suspension system. Theirs is still great after many years of jumping."
1,Airzone 13 foot trampoline,"Our family have found this product to be extremely disappointing. The bands are in no way equivalent to the bounce provided by springs on a more traditional trampoline. We were attracted to the band system because it seemed a safer alternative for children. However, the end result is a trampoline with very little bounce. An expensive mistake (bought in the UK). Try before you buy is our motto!"
5,displeased,As a family of 5 we bought this trampoline with the intent of enjoying it for many years but it has quickly fallen apart. The covering over the edges is not removable and ours has holes in it but we cannot replace just the side covers without buying a whole jumping surface.Also without the springs the jumping surface is alot less springy.
2,Will break on you within 18 months,"We purchased the Airzone Band Trampoline on October 2010 and it is in the trashcan after the welds on the trampoline frame broke off May 2012. So it was good for about 18 months. We live in Northern California in very mild weather, ie no snow or winter for that matter. The trampoline was fine and remained outdoors the entire time until the leg welds broke off. My girl is 8 years old and my boy is 6, so the trampoline was not severely abused or heavily used. We were happy with it until the day it broke. I was with the kids when the legs collapsed and I sadly had to tell them the trampoline was done. So quality-wise do not buy this item if you want it to last more than a couple of years. You can see from the numerous reviews about its quality, that it will not last very long."
4,Useful in part for passing the exams,"This book is useful as a core tutorial to learn most of the information to pass the exams, but it is necessary to go through the Microsoft exam Syllabus and learn about a number of areas from other information sources that are not covered properly in the book after you have read through it. It is ideally suited to people who know very little about Windows initially, and who want to pass the Microsoft exams before getting work experience in this area. I passed both Workstation and server exams on the strength of the book. It is not a comprehensive reference on NT, and has a number of errors (which in a way helps the learning process, because you will have a better understanding of the concept after you have figured out what they actually are meaning to say)"
2,Very shallow and superficial,"Very wordy, rambling & shallow. Possibly OK as an intro for someone who know nothing about NT, but totally inadequate for MCSE. The duplication of chapters between the NTS & NTW sections is a complete rip off.I will never buy another New Riders book again.Tim Jones"
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book to study for the MCSE exams, not realizing that it was not an official guide thanks to its blatant impersonation of one. It almost caused me to fail the workstation exam because of missed topics and incorrect information. The server section is a waste of paper as it doesn't build on the similarities between the two, merely repeats 90% of the previous section. Do not risk your professional accredition on this book."
2,Not recommended,"The book is divided in three areas; Workstation, Server and Enterprise. The first two sections share about 90% of the text.The last chapter is written by another author, so it's very different in style. It doesn't build upon the first two chapters, so much info is once again repeated.The book cover claims (as does the publisher note on Amazon) that the book covers Microsoft Exchange. In my book Exchange is MENTIONED at one location. I don't call that to cover a topic.The two chapters and questions on the registry is incorrect and misleading. It describes the best practices on NT v3.51, not on v4.0. If you follow the book text and questions you will fail the tests.//:"
2,Not detailed enough for Exam,"While I would suggest reading this book if youare a junior administrator, attempting to geta grasp of the concepts behind NT Workstation,I wouldn't recommend it for specific studymaterial for the MCP exam. It's missing largesections on DUN, sysdiff, UDF, peer webservices, among many others. The exam onthe CD-ROM is buggy, and is laden withtypos"
2,Not detailed enough for Exam Study,"I just took the Workstation test (70-073), and this book does not cover all the material on it! I passed no thanks to this book, you must have prior experience or have read other books. The book completely overlooks sysdiff.exe, uniqueness database file, unattended installs, unattended installs of other software, etc."
3,Average- Look around there are better books on the market,"I am currently studying for my MCP. I have passed the NT workstation exam and going for the Server in a months time. Reading this book alone will NOT pass you the exams, The book does not contain the detail or information that the exam questions will ask for. You are better off looking at other books on the market, which l am currently having to do if l want a chance to pass my server exam."
2,Much wasted space. Some good information,For the money this book isn't very good. If you could buy this book for $20.00 it might then seem to be a very good book. Save your money and purchase NT4.0 MCSE Study Guide by Alan Carter
2,A Waste of my Money,"This book did not provide enough information on Unattended Installations, Planning, Trouble shooting etc. In fact it probably only gave me 50% of the information I required. I failed the exam costing me the difference between this book and a better one."
4,Very good pressure gauge,"Very easy to use and contains two needles in a compartment on the back of the case. The only negative is that it does not stay on quite as long as I would prefer when you are checking pressure in several balls. (By the time you pick up the next ball and moisten the needle, the display often has just shut off but turns back on readily.) It displays pressure in tenths of a pound or in metric measure. Auto-Off feature is good except in the case noted above. Easy to read display. Also has slow release valve for letting air out a bit at a time. Very good for low pressure sports balls (volleyball, soccer, etc.) Easy to hold square design with slightly tapered sides. Red ""ON"" button easy to push in one hand operation."
1,"First time I tried it, it showed totally wrong pressure","Then it was stuck in 0.15 PSI and stuck like that for days, changing though to higher number, 0.6-0.75. It didn't turn off automatically and not possible to switch it off manually either. In a week or so it finally came off... for good. +30 USD in the trashbin without ever being able to use it."
5,Doggies say yum!,"I have 3 dogs. After giving them cheap Walmart dry food and stepping in doggie diarrhea throughout the house, a high quality dry food was necessary. I like Natures Variety Instinct because it's grain- free, good fat content, high animal protein and the kibble size is good. Expense is offset by quality over quantity of useless fillers used in cheaper food and who knows what other toxins. Plus the Subscribe and Save helps in cost, time and back breaking lugging of packages. Digestion is good. Poop looks good. Fur is fine.And I can walk without fear through the house."
2,Ruby loves it,"my grandaughter, Ruby, who just turned four has been looking for a teddy bear for a long time. Every time some one would give her one she turned it down. When she received the Gund bear she loved it right away and has not gone anywhere wothout since."
5,I love this book,"This is the 1st I've read this author, I am looking forward to reading more of her."
5,excellent,These are great bag gloves the same style has been around for a long time because they work and hold up well. You should use a set of hand wraps underneath these.
4,Just don't hit the bag too hard...,"I got these gloves in a set with a 80lb heavy bag. I don't have any boxing/MA training, so I started slowly. I found these gloves to be very well designed and EXTREMELY durable. On 2 occasions, I hit the concrete block wall instead of the heavy bag so I didn't shake the house in the night and wake everyone. There was no damage to the gloves. I think the padding and construction gave me a little too much confidence--last week while training, I was wailing on the bag, and I fractured both of my wrists. No glove can pad massive punches like I throw, so if you are like me, be careful and don't let testosterone overpower good sense. Write me: slusterly@yahoo.com"
5,A solid release from The Pharcyde,"This is a pretty solid CD from the group The Pharcyde. If you are expecting another ""Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde"" you might be a little disappointed because the group has grown much since that 1992 debut. There is no high pitched rapper and the rhymes don't quite have that comedic edge as their early work. The album definitely has a West Coast feel to it production wise artists like Mystic, Heiroglyphics, Dj Quik, Digital Underground and Planet Asia came to mind. Speaking of Heiro, Opio is featured on an interlude not listed in the CD credits. Songs that I enjoyed include ""Illusions,"" ""Right B4,"" and ""The Bomb."" Pharcyde gets their reggae on a little bit with the song ""Mixed Greens."" Smoking weed is a common theme on the album. I enjoyed the album and the CD packaging is quite unique similar to Estheros ""Wikked Lil Girls,"" the CD comes in a soft light blue jacket verses the standard jewel case.Dorrie from Thabiz"
2,What happened?,"I love the Pharcyde, Labcabin, bizzare ride, and even Plain rap was pretty good. This album sounds like a mish mosh of different songs and music made in an amateur fashion. It even cuts into reggae at one point, the vocals in general sound low and aren't really catchy at all. Worst Pharcyde album ever. Dedication/song 22 is good. Otherwise. Not a solid release what so ever. Maybe they need back Slim Kid Tre and Fat Lip?"
2,BORING,"I gave this album at least 6 straight listens and it never got any better. The beats are uninspired, tired and it just does not compare to the energy of ""ride"" and ""Cabin"". Disappointed since they have been away for quite awhile."
1,ZZZZZZ!!!,"If you want to be put to sleep, please purchase this album. I understand that bands change and grow AND try to invent new things/sounds, but this? Plenty of like sounding music out there. You'll be waiting for the songs to pick up, maybe the next song then, wait...maybe the next. wait.."
1,BUNK! BUNK! BUNK!,"I absolutely LOVE The Pharcyde. I absoluely HATE this album. Where in the hell is Fatlip? Where is the REAL Booty Brown? This album shows The Pharcyde lost in a sea of sucking. The productions sounds like it was made in two hours with a bedroom-mixer, and the rhyming is just...well...absolutely whack! Where is the laid back jazz of ""Labcabincalifornia""? Where is the crazy wordplay of ""Bizzarre Ride II""? I'm sure most listeners haven't even heard of ""Chapter One"", their independent EP. I am so dissapointed in this effort, and I cannot believe that they would put the name ""Pharcyde"" on trash like this."
2,Just Aight,"i dig ""Knew U"" but this Album feels like the Pharcyde are trying to go after the Neptunes/Outkast territory&while it's cool for novelty in areas it doesn't work for most of the Album.I dig there Older stuff. a few things here&there are cool but beyond that this Album ain't happening."
3,PC-cillin 2003,"Program works good and pattern file updates are frequent, but don't get PC-cillin 2003 if you have more than one computer and/or operating systems. You not only have to have a seperate license for each computer, if you multiboot any of your computers, you'll have to by a license for each OS you want to use the program on. I am a ""single user"" with a desktop and notebook. Between the two, I multiboot with 5 Windows OS's. You do the math and then decide if you want to use PC-cillin."
1,God help you if you've got installation problems,"This may be a good product, but I wouldn't know, I can't intall it. Support, evidently is in the Philippines, so you write an email wait a day or two and get told one of two answers: clean all previous versions (even if one was never installed), check for viruses using their website.Since every email is answered by someone different, even though you do these two things you get one of these two answers back."
2,"Good product, Bad policy","WARNING!!!! if you purchase this product you can run it on one and only one machine. For example if you have a laptop and desktop you may only install it on one of the two machines. If you try to install it on both the update feature will no longer work. When you contact TrendMicro they will inform you that you will need to buy another COMPLETE copy of the software to use it on both machines. Talk about gouging your customer!!!! There is no reason for TrendMicro to treat ""home"" users in this way. The vast majority of software companies allow a product to be used on multiple machines as long as it is by the same user.As for the product itself, it works well."
5,Most bang for your buck,"PC-Cillin installed easily for me and went to work right away. Scheduling tasks and performing manual scans - EASY! Trend Micro is on the ball with frequent updates that are painless to get through the automatic update feature. When you have a virus you can clean it out right away or click on the virus name to learn more about it. I'm glad that I didn't go the McCaffe or Norton path, because the cheapest route worked best here!"
1,Stay with PC-Cillin 2000,"Would not work properly on my Win 98se, could not update the virus patterns without causing errors. Tech support offered very little help. Try to reboot my computer and received the blue screen of death. Uninstalled PC-Cillin 2003 and reinstalled PC-Cillin 2000 and now everything works fine."
5,Smooth Installation and Operation,"I received and installed the program with no problem (Windows XP Home edition and Pentium III 500 MHz). I was a bit worried that the software would cause a substantial performance degradation on a computer of this age/speed, but things are operating pretty well -- no significant or noticable slowdown. The installation and main program control are simple/straightforward but appear robust. The updating checking is frequent and the update process fast and smooth. I have had both Macaffee and Norton and both worked fine -- this program appears to be a bit better..."
1,"A little less orchestration, a little more acting please...","All this pseudo drama ain't satisfactioning me....a little more plot a little less silliness, a little less caricature, a little more realness. A real disappointment, BBC!"
1,Much too expensive for my taste!,"At 13 episodes a season, the series price for one episode (Amazon discount) is about $5 (per episode). I am not paying double that price, for an episode I haven't even seen! Get real, Russell T. Davies & BBC!P.S. What happened to the first special? (Or are you saving that as a bonus for the ""specials full set"", making everyone re-purchase all the individual specials they bought!) Love Doctor Who! Love the new (and old) series! Hate this price gouging! Aren't you Brits having the same economic depression we are?"
2,decidedly mediocre,"I'm a big fan of the new Doctor Who series. This episode was not one of the best; in fact it was decidedly mediocre. Make no mistake about it, at 60 mins, this is an episode and not a movie.Opening with a scene stolen from Mission Impossible, and laboring under more pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo than usual, the Doctor is given none of usual opportunities to showcase his wit and enthusiasm. About the only thing going for this episode is the interesting image of a red double-decker bus in the desert and a fairly cool alien monster. Our family actually found the behind the scenes documentary of how they got the bus into the Dubai desert more exciting than the episode itself."

2,Save your money for the box-set,"We all know that BBC will release a box set of the 2009 series (along with the Next Doctor possibly) on blu-ray in the spring to coincide with Matt Smith's tenure of the Doctor. There is no compelling reason to buy this as a stand alone item. It has been shown pretty much everywhere the BBC reaches.A agree with the lack of originality mentioned by other reviewers. Plus, contrary to the comment about the picture quality is was unimpressed. Michelle Ryan is a goodish actress, but the part was over the top. It almost seemed like a stereotype & parody of itself. The anti-Bruce Wayne (i.e. thief with a ton of money).Save your $13.99 & get the whole set next Spring. That way, hopefully, you'll have at least something good."
2,Love David the Doctor,"One episode for almost $11? Are you kidding me? Is this just because it hasn't been viewed in the US? If you want to watch, it's available online. Once it airs in the US, it will be available for a $2 download at Apple. This is a complete travesty.As for the other reviews, I completely agree. An acceptable show, one of the series, but certainly NOT a $10, best of the series, price! If you want the best episode, it's the ""Family of Blood"" with Freema Agyeman 2 part... However, that said: the Christmas Special: ""The Next Doctor"" was far superior. Hopefully they put out the entire series 4.2 series on one DVD. 4 episodes for $10 is the right price."
4,Doctor in Transition,"Pretty good episode - plot was good in this transitional episode (between companions) for the Doctor. Lady Christina is a great companion match for the Doctor, too bad she was only in this one episode. I also enjoyed the UNIT tie-in and the humor associated with the idolization of the Doctor by members of UNIT."
3,"Not the Best, but Enjoyable","Pardon me, I'm going to nit-pick for a second: not EVERYONE knows about the Doctor, just U.N.I.T and Torchwood, and they've always known about him. (He worked with U.N.I.T back in the 70's, when the Timelords exiled him to earth and he didn't have access to the TARDIS.)Now that I've revealed my geekiness, I will say that I LOVE the new series even more than the classic series. This is not one of the best (and yes, ""Blink"" is one of the best ever), but it's enjoyable, nonetheless."
4,A tad pricey,my sister in law loves these candles. So i get them for her every year but they are a bit expensive for a relatively small candle.
5,Perfect gift for a skateboarder,I bought this DVD for my brother who is all into skate boarding. He told me that this documentary is informing but not boring. He said it helped him to understand the mentality of some of the greats. He said it is definatrely worth having if you love skateboarding and want to know the history! Seller also ships quick :)
3,interesting movie,"Im a longtime skater from New Zealand where we dont have backyard pools in every 2nd house, however guys like salba were high progile guys in mags when i started really getting into it, so it was interesting so see how these guys live the life as it were, some good skating and i enjoy old styles more today than when they we flavor of the day, Alva is ok, but Salba steals the show for me. I also brought ""Northwest"" which i enjoyed just as much."
4,MST 3000,"A pretty sad movie if you saw it on its own, but the Mystery Science guys make it worth watching. Don't miss the Joe Cocker imitation near the end!"
2,Not so much,"Even for MST3K I didn't find this funny. If you want a funny MST3K, go with Future War. This one was bad with both commentary and the movie."
5,Cooks Evenly,This cake pan was made in China. I use it to heat frozen entrees and it cooks them evenly. Works way better than the nonstick it replaced. Very sturdy and does not buckle. I use it for an hour at a time at 450 degrees. Very easy to clean.
3,Don't dwell on the opinions of others - form your own,"Few things in this world are as polarizing as American Idol. These reviews prove that.I thought the CD proved a few things:1) Melissa McGhee was voted off too soon.2) Ace Young can sing when he tries3) Kevin Covais never should have made the Top 12.As much as I liked Chris Daughtry, I don't love his cut on the disc. It's the song that's the problem. Stand-outs include Taylor Hicks, Paris Bennett and the aforementioned Ms McGhee. However, the reason to own this disc is Elliott Yamin's Moody's Mood For Love. It seems to be in a completely different class than the majority of the other tracks. I look forward to owning more of Yamin's work in the future. The jury is still out on the rest of this group but there is a lot more potential here than on most of the other American Idol compilations."
4,Elliott is the standout,A good recap of the season's high points for diehards like myself. But Elliott Yamin once again proves he's the season's break-out talent: his soulful interpretation of Moody's Mood is a fresh turn amid the other contestants' note-for-note covers.
3,are you people kidding?,"Wait, you're cancelling an order of another item because the reviewer on this item said something you didn't like? So now people aren't supposed to offer their honest opinions on things they're reviewing? Some of these ""OMFG im nevar gonna orderz stuf from amazzzon agian!!!"" reviews are extraordinarily childish.As far as what she said, she has a point. Taylor has a good voice, but his wasn't the best of the finalists this year. And even if she wasn't right, why should it matter to you? You're proving her wrong by voting the guy the winner. Of course, you also made some horrible, horrible voting choices on other matters over the course of the season, so maybe Americans don't just vote based on voice (shocker!!).Grow up, kids. Besides, if you don't order the stuff from amazon, you'll just have to bug your parents into driving you to Best Buy."
3,Cancelled Order,"Yesterday I purchased 3 Idol Winner cd's from Amazon. Today, after reading the scathing review of Taylor Hicks Takin it to the Streets, I have cancelled my order and will purchase elsewhere. I will not purchase the full Idols CD, as the ONLY artist that I am interested in is Taylor Hicks. My advice to Amazon is to replace the reviewer with someone who knows what they are talking about. You have incurred the wrath of the Soul Patrol."
1,SOUL PATROL!,"I was going to purchase the CD through Amazon but after the unprofessional review that was obviously mean-spirited and biased against Taylor Hicks AND his fans, I have decided the following: I will still buy the CD but will buy it through Amazon's biggest competitor. No way will I give you a sale after that dribble of a review - you don't deserve the Soul Patrol's business (which, by the way, would have been massive). You lose!"
2,"Disappointing CD, Disappointed on Amazon","First the review `controversy"" Ridiculous. People grow up. It is just an opinion, right or wrong like your own. That's all. I'm disappointed that Amazon did not support its employee and actually removed the review from the site. And for all of you threatening to boycott Amazon, really get a life.This was by far the worst AI season. No contestants stuck up. Nobody had anything new or different to offer. People were stunned that Chris Daultry was let go before the finals. Well, if you think about it, the guy is light years behind from the Bo Bice of last year.As for the rest of the final twelve; mediocrity was the pattern. And this CD release painfully reflects that mediocrity.Let's wait for the next season and hope for the best."
5,"Oh, my goodness!! You NEED to own this!","""American Idol"" continues to be the hottest TV show around, and this is the album that features all of this season's contestants. I'm pretty mad that Chris Daughty got booted early, but this is a fantastic record showing REAL talent. Go ""A.I.""!"
4,Get a new job Tammy!!!,"Tammy would be better off getting a new job, cos she stinks at giving reviews. I'll be buying my AI cd and Taylor's new release somewhere else!!! I already have ""Under the Radar"" and totally love it. I'm sure another store will gladly sell me all the Taylor Hicks cd's I want to buy. Amazon is the loser here....next to Tammy!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,All for Melissa,She is amazing and was booted off wayyyyyy to soon. She has the best song on the Cd. America could not have gone any more wrong than they did with her so did simon. I cant wait to she gose out with a full out album the AI people will be sorry.
5,AI5 = Amazing Group of Idols!,"This year's American Idol produced some great talent. My favorite is Taylor Hicks, but it's not my favorite track on this album. Actually, Ace's ""Father Figure"" is outstanding!Paris and Mandisa's tracks are also great listening, and I hope that all these idols go far with their music.Highly reccommend this CD - you are sure to find a favorite sound, because they are so varied!"
1,this will make you run to find the original songs,"I liked the version of Wanted Dead or Alive; it wasn't great, but it was pretty good. However, halfway through the first verse of Father Figure, which is one of my favorite songs,I literally ran at top speed to find the original lest I go crazy. Ace Young's version was awful-especially the background vocals- and on top of that, he forgot some of the words!I wonder why none of the judges ever pointed that out when they were performing. After that, I couldn't listen to this. YUK!"
4,one shining star,"as a fan of american idol....i was delighted with the album.however, only Elliott Yamin's rendition of james moody's ""moody's mood for love"" was an outright STANDOUT.looking forward to hearing more from this young talent."
3,This is the first time American Idol has disappointed me!,"There are a few songs on here that I enjoyed ,especially Ace's Father Figure and Melissa's song. I thought Kellie sounded good also. I was disappointed in the song choice for Katharine, my favorite AI 5 singer. I just didn't like the song choices for some of the others too. For the first time I found myself fast forwarded through about half of the songs."
5,Absolutely the best yet!,"This is by far the best album to come from American Idol. Every cut could be put out as a single and do well. If you followed this season at all, this album is a must have. If you never watched, but are thinking about buying one of the Idol albums, this is it! I of course have a favorite, Moody's Mood for Love by Elliott Yamin. I am anxiously awaiting his first album, but in the mean time I will listen to this album again and again."
5,Best Idol CD yet....,"I loved everyone this season, which is a first for me. I am looking foward to my first tour. I've never gone but, really wanted to go this year because of Ace Young! I love his smooth voice and, Father Figure on this CD is no exception. It is my favorite followed by Chris Daughtry, Taylor Hicks and, Melissa McGhee. I also really enjoy Bucky, Elliot, Mandisa and the rest. This was a great season! Ace is the most talented in my opinion. I voted for him many times each week and, I felt that he left way too soon. I'll buy any CD he releases!"
4,american idol season 5,"It was good. I love the show. Didn't particularly like who won this year, but everyone else who voted for him did. The songs were all good choices for the singers. I have all the previous years also."
2,This isn't what I saw on T.V.,"This CD is horrible! It doesn't showcase the talents of the American Idols strongly! A lot of voices have been changed, and I can't stand it! I haven't heard Mandisa sing in ages, but when I heard her on this CD, I couldn't believe that her voice had been changed! Honestly, this isn't what I would buy! If only Mandisa or Paris or Chris had made it to the finals. At least we would get to hear them the way they sound. DON'T BUY IT!"
4,Enjoyed this item,This item was good and it was good to hear all the idols again and to remember the excitement of this year especially Taylor who is the best idol yet. They will never top him.
3,I keep wanting to listen to Elliott's track over and over,"Hey AI, can you make another CD with 12 Yamin track and call it good. I can't get enough of this guy!"
3,ELLIOTT STEALS THE SHOW (ARREST HIM NOW),"Elliott Yamin's version of Moody's Mood for Love is refreshing, he sounds so much like a younger Stevie Wonder. His voice unlike the other 11 idols sounds seasoned and rich. He puts the others to shame, plum shame.There were however, some notable worthy to be mentioned: The American Idol-Taylor Hicks did a good job, alone with Mandisa(however the background band was off),Chris-of course, and surprisingly Melissa McGhee. However, none matched Elliott's rich, soulful, and powerfully haunting voice on this track. He is definitely in a class by himself. His CD I await with baited breath, I simply LOVE this man's VOICE. Love Love Love his voice!He will blow up the SOUL/R&B; charts with his CD. He will tear the roof off the POP charts. Hopefully he will be matched with the right producers, songwriters, and agents. Singing with Mary J Blige was an excellent start for him.GOOD LUCK to you ELLIOTT- OUR NEW AMBASSADOR OF SOUL (MUSIC)."
3,Elliott Yamin = Incredible!!!,How did this man not win this ridiculous show?! He blows the others out of the water with his amazing rendition of 'Moody's Mood For Love'. WOW! A+
5,Some are awesome and some are ok.,"This season really suprised me with such great talent. There are some great tracks on here such as Elliott Yamin's ""Moody's Mood For Love"", he has the best voice this season and he will go far.Chris's track was also great and I hope to hear from him soon. I liked Taylor also, he has such a soulful voice.The rest are just ok.....I was very disapointed with Katherine, Mandisa, and Paris...they have such great voices but these tracks do them no justice. And Melissa really suprised me, she sounded really better on this album."
4,Thank you Elliott!!!!,I never would have purchased this cd if it wasn't for Elliott Yamin. His soulful voice makes this cd a good buy. Elliott is by far the American Idol of this CD.
3,"Rushed compilation - salvaged only by Elliott Yamin's ""Moody's Mood For Love""","If you have never heard this song before, this is your opportunity. Sans the female contribution to this number (I don't know which is more disappointing - that or the overdone background vocals and arrangement) Yamin gives us an above average rendition of the intricate runs originally set by another instrument - the saxophone. It's no wonder only this season's most gifted vocalist can achieve a masterful delivery, good enough to add to your collection."
4,"Buy it, if only for Elliott Yamin","You've read the reviews for yourself. There's no denying that Yamin has got the best vocal chops this season and arguably, in all five seasons of American Idol. His soulful, smoky rendition of James Moody's jazzy ""Moody's Mood for Love"" is fresh and innovative in a music scene that has overdosed on billboard pop ala Daniel Powter. Elliott Yamin = longevity and critical praise. Other highlights include the tracks by Chris, Mandisa and Joe Cocke--ehem--Taylor Hicks."
5,you just have to love Elliot's voice,I LOVE Elliot's rendition of Moody's Mood For Love. This young man has the voice of an angel and touches my soul. You can not deny that he sings from his heart.Waiting to hear more from you Elliot Yamin.My Idol
2,Elliott Is The Voice,"I've listened to the entire CD and I have to admit that I actually do like Ace Young's version of ""Father Figure"" but I admit that my favorite on the CD is Elliott Yamin. I absolutely hate the version that was given him of this song, but I absolutely love the voice that goes with it. The man can sing...apparently no matter what song he's given. I think he needs a few lessons on vibrato and the like but the guy just has such a tremendous voice that overwhelms the rest of the ""Idols"". The CD is worth buying just to hear his song; although not a pop song, a very worthy easy listening song. I salute you, Elliott. You ""done good""."
3,It's Yamin & Co?,After listening to the album I know why Fox rushed this one. They knew they'd blown this season despite having the most talented bunch & wanted to catch the fans before they switched allegiance. The selection is mediocre except for one exception. Elliott Yamin has energized the album with a great rendition of 'Moody's Mood for Love'. Who is American Idol 5? Listening to this album I think America got it wrong this time.
4,Taylor and Chris and Company,How can you not like this CD? It's a lot of fun. For me Taylor and Chris said it all. I just wish WALK THE LINE had been on this CD.
5,why are people bashing Kellie's track?,In my opinion its one of the best and most unique tracks on the album. It wasn't a bad song choice and it sounds great. They just must not be familiar with the song or what real country music is.-Maddy(AL)
4,Almost WoW,"In my opinion Chris is the Best on the cd, and I think he is the real American Idol, but I also love melissa, that girl can singggg, and she was booted way to soon from the show. The only reason i started watching that stupid show again was cuz i heard chris sing, and i was hooked again...I won't be watching anymore but I will buy anything chris or melissa put out..."
1,Eeek,"I confess I'm not a fan of American Idol. But I wanted to understand all the brouhaha garnered by these idols, so I decided to hear and judge for myself. What a mediocre recording...horror of horrors! I thought I was in disco night at the local bar. The only recording I found redeeming was Dead or Alive by Chris Daughtry. I loved this guy's voice. The rest were completely forgettable. So would I buy a CD for just one song?? NO. I'll wait till Chris Daughtry sign with a reputable recording label, hopefully with all that makes rock special and not a load of crappy, cheesy pop. I can only think that America made him a favor when they voted him off, saving him from this type of abysmal music, and thus failure. I think I'll pass on this one.I was intrigued also by Mandisa, but since I can't stand to hear ""I'm Every Woman"" once again, I couldn't validate her voice. Would like to hear her recording something contemporary and not something that has been done over and over."
2,not a good cd at all; the worst talent of AI history,"season 5 in all was not good at all.....i have owned all the other cds from the previous cds and were way better than this lackluster... im a huge AI fan i caught the show whenever i was not workin...kathrine, chris, paris, mandisa, & elliott were the only ones with talent.... sorry to say that taylor should not b our american idol..... he is a good singer and yes he won because he knows how to entertain but honestly i would have felt better about the season if elliott or kathrine won...im so glad they are releasing ""somewhere over the rainbow"" from kathrine cuz that was the best performance in season 5 hands down....i would have gone into detail about the season but they were not great..... hopefully they get their act together and have some better talent than previous seasons....1.9 out of 5 stars...."
4,Puzzled,"I am puzzled as to why Amazon would allow a person to review a cd who is deaf and obviously has a predetermined bias of her various idol contestants which comes forth loud and clear in her idiotic review.Why would Amazon allow such [...] and why do you want to alienate AMERICANS who chose their idol? Are you guys making too much dough here that you don't care about 40 Million buyers?The score is Taylor Hicks 40,000,000 fans who actually buy cd'sTammy something or other 0 and who should stick to critiqueing Barney cd's"
3,Chris Daughtry...awesome,"CD, Okay...too pop for my taste. Chris's cover of Wanted Dead or Alive excellent. Chris has an excellent voice and can't wait to buy his first Cd. I like Elliot, Paris and Mandissa."
4,Quite enjoyable!,I really do enjoy the CD but I wish they had put the songs in order of how the contestants were voted off the show. Some of the previous CDs were done that way and I like it better.
2,Looking for a reason to purchase? Elliot Yamin.,"Elliot Yamin was the absolute best talent on the show this year, and this CD proves that. The fact that he didn't even make it to the final shows America's absolute lack of judging talent.Elliot and Ace's songs are the only ones on this CD worth listening to. Chris is great, but I hate his song on here. ""Memories of us"" would have been a much better choice for this CD. He sung that song exceptionally well on the show.All of that is secondary however. This is Elliot's CD. You buy this for Elliot's song.Nuff said."
4,American Idol Season 5,The people that I bought the CD to listen to were as good as I expected. First season that I watched the show and really enjoyed it.
2,american idol season 5,"Although I watched the whole season 5 and I loved it, the final result was not that great. I guess the songs picked, were not the best. Overall, I didn't like it enough."
5,Elliott Yamin= 5 stars!,"Elliott Yamin makes this CD worth buying. His performance of ""Moody's Mood for Love"" is absolutely amazing. He sounds like a polished professional. His voice is stunning. The musical arrangement is not the best, but he more than makes up for it with his vocals. Outstanding. It is almost out of place on this CD because it is so above and beoyond the vocals of the other singers.Chris Daughtry gives a solid performance as well, sounding as if he has been singing in a rock group for his whole life.The standout is definitely Yamin, making it worth the whole $10 just to hear his silky smooth voice tear this song up! You will be not be disappointed!"
4,Elliott Yamin? Where Have You Been All My Life?,"OMG! This man is absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to see what else he comes out with. What a pure, soulful voice. I will buy anything else he records and can hardly wait for his solo CD. If you think he sounded fabulous live, he's just as good in the studio.Elliott, whatever you do, DON'T STOP SINGING!BTW, Chris Daughtry tears it up too. What a wonderful voice he has! It's just a shame these two men weren't in the finals instead. Good luck to both Elliott and Chris.I'm only giving this four stars because some of the other cuts aren't all that great. Elliott and Chris' contributions are worth the price. Mandisa is good too, so is Ace. Taylor does a decent job too."
5,Yamin just blows my MIND!!!,"This entire CD was worth buying, if ONLY for Elliott Yamin's ""Moody's Mood For Love"" his vocal on this track is just absolute mindblowing to me!! How he hasn't won a grammy already is beyond me!! I also enjoyed Ace, Chris and Melissa's songs, and there was a mixture of oh-oh's and so-so's. I gave it the 5 stars JUST for Elliott though, cause WOW!!:)"
2,not that great,"ive been a fan of the show since the first seson, and in my opnion last year was so much better, sure they can sing but there song choices this year were crappy. i dont like any of the songs on the cd either, but melissa mcghee, paris bennett, mandisa, and taylor hicks are the best on it. the others are good...but they were better."
3,In my humble opinion,"All top 12 idols are hopeful to be crowned but in the end, only one can really be. It is obvious to me by the comments written on this review, that everyone had thier favorite but in my eyes truly they are all winners regardless of who is crowned in the finale. If you are purchasing this CD it will be because someone you admire is on and for that reason alone you will treasure it. Each contestant has a different range, different talent, different vocal style. The television show appeals to all different venues and all people of the world. Therefore I believe anyone who purchases this CD will be happy with at least one song on it. In the end, I feel it is totally inappropriate to be using this space as a bashing outlet of YOUR personal opinion of who should've been crowned winner this year. Folks, that is what the American Idol message boards are for."
3,Elliott can really sing!,Elliott Yamin's Moody's Mood for Love is the sole (or should I say soul!) reason to buy this CD. His gorgeous voice will introduce this jazz classic to a new generation of listeners. I'm anxiously awaiting his own debut CD!
3,music critics are so funny,"Is it a smart business move to post an editorial on a CD you are trying to sell that bashes the person that got millions of votes weekly by people hoping that he would be back the next week to sing again? I'm certainly not going to buy it now. To Tammy La Gorce, Taylor does sound different than the other sounds you hear on the radio every single day. But, thats OK. We are ready for something different. That's kinda why we spent our time voting for him each week. Step outside that musical box you are in. It is really nice out here, you may even start to enjoy it!"
4,Don't Buy This From Amazon! - Editorial Review Was Biased & Offensive,"This is a great cd that will be enjoyed by all AI fans; however, Amazon's Editorial Review was very biased and unprofessional. Amazon, you need to get better people to review your music. A lot of people are offended at the review and will purchase this cd elsewhere. Your sales of this cd will be affected. Amazon.com is there to sell music and present the product in a fair manner; Let the customers decide if the cd was good or bad. I'll be boycotting the sale of this cd on your website, along with thousands of other potential customers."
4,Great CD for a great year,"WOW! Your review is a little harsh, don't you think, Tammy. I happen to agree that Elliott is amazing but I can't for the life of me imagine why you are so vicious about Taylor. It's also amazing that your company (wonder how you were enabled to write this review LOL...musical genious I think you're not) even allowed this through as an apparent ""official"" Amazon review. Sorry you don't get Taylor...honestly it's your loss. Luckily I do get him and will enjoy him for YEARS to come."
5,great for travling,american idol season 5 was great it was a life saver on my recent vacation from tennessee to oklahoma it kept my teens busy they listened to it for hours
3,American Idol - Season Five - Encores,This could have been a great CD but the wrong songs were selectded for these individuals. Whoever produced this CD did not put a lot of time and effort into it.
4,Taylor/Elliott,"I'd personally like to thank Tammy, rather than withdraw a what? 5 dollar order? I wouldn't necessarily just like to bash Taylor, because I know public opinion concerning him is extremely high. However, I would suggest that if American Idol would have really been a SINGING competition, rather than a popularity contest, Taylor Hicks would not have won. What do I mean by that? To clarify, if American Idol were a radio show, it's my opinion (I'm a music major, BTW) that Elliott Yamin would have won, with Chris Daughtry and Mandisa Hundley (her dismissal is another story) following close behind."
3,COOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For the most part I really, really, really liked it. I'm a HUGE fan of A.I., but, being a country lover, I didn't know mosty of the songs. I don't think the songs on it were that popular. I think last year's CD was better, but mostly I really liked this year's. I liked tons of the songs, such as Dead or Alive (Chris Daughtry), What About Love (Mellisa McGhee), and Takein' It to the Streets (Taylor Hicks). All in all, I would DEFINITLY BUY THIS CD, IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Tammy Has No Clue,"Well, Tammy La Gross - how they let you review this is beyond me. Did you even watch the show? Doubtful. The reason Taylor won was because he does connect with the audience, we feel the song thru him - to say that he doesn't is totally false and obviously shows you have not watched the show. Your making assumptions from listening to one song and the songs on this cd weren't everybody's best. Do a little background work next time."
5,Idols,I enjoyed the program and am very happy with the end results as I am an Alabamian. The CD was very good.
2,"It's GREEN, not BROWN...","The bag itself is okay (slightly lower quality than I had expected, but still nice). The problem is the color. Green. I am obsessed with brown so maybe I am a little biased.. but that doesn't change the fact that when you see a picture of a product you expect to get THAT PRODUCT.I see that other reviewers had the same experience.I complained (to Amazon.com) and received a refund of 25% (I also had the option of returning it for a full refund). I decided to keep it because I love the embroidered design. And the size."
3,Nice Bag,"Nice bag for the price. Not exactly as sturdy as I wanted for a carry on. I filled it with spa goodies and gave it to my mom, she loved it."
3,Pretty but not what I expected,This bag is really very nice. It's green not brown but the color of the actual bag looks nicer in my opinion. The only problem is that the bag in the photo is propped up and looks sturdy like it would stand on its own. The actual bag does not and as I was looking for a sturdy tote bag for law school this bag really just doesn't cut it.
2,Was not the same as the picture provided,I was expecting to get the tote that was in the picture but the tote I recieved didn't have the colored design on the bottom that the picture shows. It was just the plain kaki color that is on the sides. I was upset because that was my favorite part of the tote. Otherwise recieved fast in great condition.
2,HUGE Tote!!!!,HUGE!!! HUGE!!! HUGE!!! That is the only way I can describe it!!! Also very floppy!!! One of the straps is tearing even though I haven't put anything heavy in it! Embroidery is falling apart too!
2,More about coming to terms with his father....,"I very much agree with Daniel Waterman & his ""Mixed Bag"" review. Ultimately this seems to be more of a cathartic effort by the writer. It should have been titled more appropriately & been sold as such. I wouldn't have wasted my time or money."
2,To See Every Bird On Earth /Retired Fong,"Unfortunately,not a book for someone whose main interest is birdingFather son relationship not really developed very well although there certainly is a warning to distracted parents to pay attention to children,while their children are children"
3,...wow/...,"kinda upset with the performance of the bulb it gave out after about 5, im going to try to put the other bulb that came wth it to pump the inflateble ring, on it and mabey ill see better results.delivery was fast.it did work good untill the bulb gave outand it didnt come with the bonus ""beaded"" male ring."
1,You get what you pay for,"So much for the bargain pricing. This was not worth it at all. Went into the trash and bought one of the ""medical grade"" units which was far superior. I think this one should be listed in the ""novelty"" section."

4,"Double the power, double the fun!","Please buy two! I'm no square (square...get it....""doubling""...I mean....two squared is four, but one squared is just...well one), but this product changed my wife (get it, ""wife""...rhymes with ""life""....which is what you were expecting me to write, right?...ha ha....""write""....""right""....get it?...ho ho ho....""ho""....""'ho""...get it? I mean ""ho ho ho"" as in Santa saying ""ho ho ho"" is like a synonym with ""'ho""...which is a contraction for ""wh*re"" which is one of Amazon's forbidden words....).Really [gufaw] all kidding aside. This is really good and you should buy it here rather than some creapy store in a creapy neighborhood where you might be getting ""used"" goods, if you know what I mean."
3,Nice apron. Bad seller!!!!,"Nice apron, but I would not recommend doing business with Kitchen's Etc. Order placed first week of December 2003, while apron was in stock. It wasn't even shipped until January 3rd 2004. I emailed asking for an explanation, and they never responded. I am sure they don't care much about a $5 shipping charge on a $15 apron, but they will not be receiving any more business from me. Bad customer service."
3,Great visuals...,"But the narrator was very long winded. It's wonderful to see the temples, but I would've liked much more of them and much less of the guy who made the film."
3,A pleasure.,"I've been doing the same type of work to trace my mother's family, and was encouraged and delighted by Mr. Paolicelli's story--it's amazing how many similarities there are in our experiences.But I was disappointed in the end of the adventure, and the drama of the narrative: the book draws you into the relationship the author has with Luigi (it's all in the title!), and he's forgotten in the end. What was it like to leave Italy? Is he still in touch with Luigi, Sebash, etc.?Also, I was surprised at several editorial inconsistencies and incidents of sloppiness in the book. For example, at one point the narrator translates roman numerals for us, but the numerals do not add up to ""1801"" as way he reveals. Several sentences were unclear and confusing, and a better editor wouldn't have let this happen."
5,"A richly detailed, personal tour of Italy.","Paul Paolicelli heads for Italy to find his roots, but along the way leads us on a great tour that sweeps in such disparate themes as Roman history, American jazz, the Catholic faith, and flavors of great food.He tells it all in wonderfully detailed antecdotes and conversations, often involving his Italian foil, Luigi. (And he manages to smoothly translate every Italian word, so he never leaves language-impaired Americans behind.)Ultimately, what makes ""Dances"" so musical is Paolicelli's obvious passion for life that gathers us up and carries us from start to finish."
5,I devoured this book in one sitting I loved it so much!,"I wanted to read this book because I am of Italian ancestry but have never been to Italy. I was able to buy the book used for $4.45 and I would have happily paid full price!His story was very engaging. It seemed to me that he was making the journey not because he was an expert, or going to become an expert, but because he had questions about his family history that he wanted answered. I am hoping to make a similar journey someday and his story has inspired me to turn my hope into reality. His insights will serve me well when I prepare for my own travels."
1,Hokey and Contrived,"I expected a lot from this book but it was filled with soppy sentimentality. It was amazing how many times tears were brought to his eyes and how situations came alive at the most prophetic moment. And the most amazing of all the ""just-in-time"" epiphany. Give it a break!"
4,Makes theology understandable and applicable,This is a great book to read as an introduction or transition into theological studies that can be applied to the everyday ministries of the church. I highly recommend this book.
5,Energy,Recall that ordinary salt is a compound of sodium and chlorine. List several systems that can be defined in a shaker full of salt.
1,Sloppy publishers!,"I cannot fault the authors, or what might be terrific content. But the publishers released a really messed up run of copies with misnumbered or missing pages; further, the accompanying DVD wouldn't load.The vendor credited me when I sent it back."
5,Superb guide,"I've worked wirth and recommended the past several editions of this book -- and each one has been better than the last. With the Premiere Pro 2 edition, Droblas and Greenberg have raised the bar even further, with even more comprehensive information and valuable insight on workflow, special effects and creating smoothly running, professional looking digital video. The enhanced information on creating animated menus is especially valuable. I'm using this in my own work, as well as recommending it to my students."
4,Adobe Premiere Pro CS3 Bible,"I recently received this book to help me become familiar with Premiere Pro. It is great for someone getting started and includes a wide range of topics. While I generally prefer color, the black and white illustrations are proving to be most helpful and provide clarity while learning this software."
4,Real stuff for the real world!,"Calling all teens.....Do you want to know what it really takes to make it in the real world? The secrets that are in this book, you won't get in any school. I believe that the principles in this book have helped me along the way.Chad Fostor is a wonderful businessman who made his money very early in life. He gives credit to his people skills.This book will go over some things that you probably not even heard or thought about. Read this book with an open mind. May this book give you some guidance about how to make a network of friends and cultivate great relationships while you are young."
3,Book for Teens,"I ordered this book to use in one of my HS classes I teach. It was OK, but nothing that I wasn't covering already. It is a decent supplement to my class for those who have additional dual-credit assignments."
5,The book to organize step by step your writing,"I have two non fiction books published. Alas, I discovered Shaun Fawcett book after my books were already in print. In it I found many things I had to learn the hard way. I have read many books on how to write books, some of them excellent, but they did not have this step by step approach plus a flowchart. I was dreaming of a book of this kind, with a fully developed step by step plan. Well this book exists. If you plan to be a non fiction writer this book will avoid you costly mistakes and will accelerate your path towards success. Also, it will enable you to become an author-entrepreneur of your own books. The key to it is the step by step plan. Buy it!"
1,New Age meth pusher/pot smoker does cd--expects you to buy it,"What on God's green earth was this poor soul thinking?

Your guess is as good as anyone's.Well, you get it by now.Peaceful? No! It is certainly not peaceful. High tension is more like it. Agitating!!!"
5,"""A Trip Back in Time"" ... to the Civil War","I found this book to be especially well-written with so much attention given to minute details. Not an easy task with a long-ago subject! Every battle, every personal experience by Gen. Greene and his family and troops so well documented. It needs to be in every highschool Civil War class either as an elective or required class. Page after page of references which bring the reader right into the events!Marthajane Kirby, Saranac, Michigan"
4,Electronica Dance,"Incorporates remixes of all tracks here to include a dance club style beat. The tunes are true to tangerine dream, but geared for the dance floor not the meditation/lounge chair."
5,The one album everyone should have,The Dream Mixes by Tangerine Dream is one of the most awe inspiring and beautiful albums ever conceived. It's rich textures and strong back-beat will keep you listening over and over. This timeless album is a must have! You will not be dissapointed.
5,Unable to summarize...,"This CD is so unbelievable, I don't even know where to begin. I've had it for about 4 years now, and on average, I've listened to it at least once every week, probably more often. And I love it MORE now than I ever did before. This is the only CD I own that I've enjoyed for so long and still love. When loud, it's energetic and upbeat, when soft, it's mellow and romantic. The layers are unbelievable (I'm still finding instruments and sounds I never noticed before), but the melodies are even more compelling. I own three copies of this CD, and it was so great that I went out and purchased the double version just for the second disk. If I was told I could keep just ONE CD for the rest of my life, this would be it."
5,Must-buy title of Tangerine fans!,"With the ryhtms they're not used to play before, this album has become a real listening pleasure."
5,Can be listened to over and over and over,Great upbeat remixes of a range of Tangerine Dream songs. I used it for going along with excersize so it creates a nice aerobic trance state.Buying it again because it was stolen a while back with my portable CD. (It was almost always in the CD player so they went together!)
2,Quite fun,"Described as `a just-for-fun project' by Edgar Froese, the ""The Dream Mixes"" presents something of a new face to Tangerine Dream. The UK version is better value--it has 2 CD's--but this edition has the better selection of music. And while none of these mixes improve on the originals, if you're into dance or trance you'll probably quite like this. Tangerine Dream have done much better than this, though...(For a fuller review by me of this disc's UK incarnation, take a look at this disc's page on amazon.co.uk)"
1,"cheap,not Tangerine Dream-like","I am a great fan of TD,I just adore their old creations(till' 83).They had magic,a very personal style,something what made every cell of my body feel the extasy of that personal drug created only by TD,and nobody else.I'm sorry to say that the love of my musical life,TD, do not create any vibration for my soul.I would have never believed that I would say this,but for me they lost their magic."
3,"Better than a lot of popular ""techno"" out there","Give this an extra star if you're a Tangerine Dream fan. To the general listener, especially if you heard it about 6 years ago, this sounds exactly like what Robert Miles was doing with his big hit ""Children"". As a matter of fact, when I heard that song I thought for a moment that it was TD remixed.There are new and old tracks on here, meaning TD has mixed some recent material (from the Tyranny of Beauty album, for instance) as well as crafted some slick new tracks. There are some good, driving tracks here, perfect car stereo stuff. Also some great treatments of tunes like Catwalk.This album may definitely sound dated now, but it's still a nice aside from TD. Hard to classify it really. Sounds like very simple, melodic techno, often more ambient than pounding. Again, if you like Robert Miles' more popular stuff, this is good, if not better. Yes, a cheese factor, and just a tremendous mullet on Jerome Froese."
2,Not that great,"Well, this is decent, if dated, trance/progressive music. Having not heard the originals from which these songs are based, the only real critsism I can give is that of a fan of this sort of music--and in that case, this is a dissapointment. The first song is pretty good, a wash of synths and beats, but after that every song sounds very similar...too similar...as if they recycled the synths for every song. I can't conclude without a few examples of mixes where this sort of music is pulled off with glorious effect: check out Sasha and Digweed's _Northern Exposure_ and _Northern Exposure: East Coast_ albums for trance and pH blended to the utmost degree, or some Renaissance Worldwide imports (pricy but worth it)."
1,"Poor Quality, Stay away from this company","This product may or may not work out of the box. Having had this for multiple years, I have had continual problems with this product from the beginning. This company is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. You know the type, they try everything in their power to blame the customer for the poor quality of the products and have you make additional purchases to correct what never worked in the first place. My advice is to just skip buying anything from this company."
3,good filter for small pond not 3000 gallons,the filter is made for small ponds with fish... the 3000 on the label is missleading .its only 3000 gallons if you have no fish..you do not need a filter if you dont have fish.. probably good for a large preformed pond..also when the fish load increases it needs constant cleaning...limit 1000 gallons and 5 koi or 15 goldfish
5,Great value!,"I have a two level pond with a natural waterfall (no weir filter) that's about 2500 gallons of water combined. The pond had only a pump, no filter for about a year. Needless to say the water was dark green. I installed this filter flush to the ground and starting using it. Within 2 weeks the pond was almost completely clear! I was shocked how quickly it worked. It's been about 3 months since I purchased and I still have no issues with the filter. It's quiet and not noticeable when installed in the ground. I love it so far!"
5,my fish are as happy as clams,"i purchased this item three weeks ago. initially, the light didn't work and i called the seller. he promptly returned my call and said he would replace it. as it turned out, it was unecessary, because the light went on and hasn't been a problem since. i have 12 baby koi in my pond that i previously had not been able to see. within days, the water cleared and i now gather with my child and husband to feed them each morning. well worth the money."
5,A keep-forever book,"When I Was Older is an intricate study of the soul. Freymann-Weyr clasped my hand and pulled me into Sophie, then clasped my heart and pulled me into understanding. This is book for all ages and all souls!"
5,One of my favorite books,"This is one of my favorite books. The characters felt so real and were very memorable, especially Francis. I liked the plot and felt satisfaction when it endded. It was an easy read, but was also well written."
4,TRACKS...,"1. Hope 3:572. Not Alone 3:203. Everything 3:394. In Front Of Me 3:495. Somehow, Someway 2:31"
4,Good for first grade,"This is a good, simple introduction to spelling for kids. One beef I have with it is that they say ""ABC order."" It's a small thing, I know, but kids are smart. You can say ""alphabetical order"" and they'll not only understand, but they will know the proper terminology. I'm also not sure I agree with the proofreading exercises. I'm nervous that kids might imprint the improper spelling on their brains just as easily as the correct spelling, thereby causing more problems than the exercise is seeking to prevent. You can just mark out that segment, though, if you agree with me. Otherwise, I like it."
5,Julia's Hope by Leisha Kelly,This series is so good. Each book is excellent.A lot of great messages and things to think about.
2,Way to many characters.,"I am an avid reader and I did not like this book in that it had way to many characters with not enough differentiation between them. I had to go back time and again to look up characters!! Some of the characters even had similar names with little difference in personality. Also, it just seemed to far fetched to be 'given' a home and everything they wanted was given to them. Not for me. I didn't finish it (which is rare) and got rid of it.I did like reading about farm life."
5,Great Book For The Lost,"If you are looking for a strategy guide for Myst, then this is the one to get. It's great, ead really simple to follow. I'd suggest this one over the others."
4,A must for ceramic tile floors,"I've had my floormate for many years and it is still working great. I am very careful about cleaning it when finished, though, and I think that has helped. You can use it as a dry vac or wet vac. You will have to empty the dirty water and refill wash water several times, however, if you have a large area. But it is still a better choice than mopping. It also came in handy when I had a small ""flooding"" occur. It quickly sucked up the water before it spread any further. Be sure to use the proper cleaning solution with it and no bleach!"
1,HOOVER H2850 FLOORMATE,"We had the original FloorMate which ran out of steam after 2 years of continuous use. This one can not compare. The shampoo portion leaks, it leaves streaks on the floor, the brushes are practically useless and we are generally disappointed and thinking of purchasing an upgraded model."
2,"If it only woked, I'd had given it 5 stars","This is my fourth floor-mate third model in 3 years. The two problems with this model is that it puddles if left alone on or off, and the other main problem it that the suction ""flap"" in the Intake cup (for the lack or the actual word) keep closing even tho there is nothing clogging it. So it needs to be turned off every other minute so the flap can release itself. $129.00 for this? Do I go to the next model or Skip HOOVER all together? Does any one know of another company that make something like the floor-mate? It is a totally great idea if it only worked without the flaws these ""floor mates"" have."
1,Stopped working within 30 seconds,I got this out of the box...turned it on and it stopped working within 30 seconds. To me this is a bit of a negative. It is also bigger and heavier than I imagined. My one positive - it does roll smoothly across the floor. Wish I could have tried to wet option.
3,Would spend a little more for the better FloorMate,"This is my second FloorMate and while it isn't bad, I do not like this one nearly as much as the slightly more expensive ones. The brush system is not nearly as effective."
3,Good Scrubbing; Mediocre Suction,"I purchased this product for the hardwood homes throughout our home. The scrubbing action works well to get stuck-on stuff off the floor. The machine is easy to assemble and use. However, the suction seems poor. On the dry-vac setting, it pushes around even small pieces of debris (i.e. popcorn kerneal) instead of sucking it up. It often blows dust-bunnies around instead of eliminating them. I have gone back to the old manual Swiffer for dust-mopping.On the wet setting, it will pool water underneath it if left in one place for very long (so then I'm toweling up dirty water). I was excited to get this labor saver and it's better than a mop bucket but still leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Floormate review,I've used these before - on the good side the tank is easier to get on & off. Negative this Floormate doesn't seem as powerful as the other one I had. It leaves water and doesn't dry or scrub like the other one. I also would prefer an item made in America. Once this one stops working I don't think I will purchase another one.
1,The original spinbrush was much better,"I have all ceramic tile floors, two large dogs and a kid. I used the first Spinbrush that came out and was really impressed. It scrubbed cleaned my floors very well. When it finally gave out I bought the Powerbrush300 and have disliked it from day one. It has a single brush that turns like a vacuum sweeper which seems to smear the water instead of picking it up - the Spinbrush has several that turn horizontally. You can't remove the brush to clean it so for those of us with dogs the hair gets trapped between the brush and the top and I have to stick my fingers up inside it to get the old nasty hair out. I've stuck with it for a year but I'm ready to give up and see if the new Spinbrush works as well as the original one."
3,"works well on smooth floors, not on my rough tile","This works well on my wood floors and on my smooth tile floors but not on my rough kitchen tile. It isn't able to get into the nooks and crevices like it needs to. I thought the dry vac worked well although I read other reviews that said it didn't(and I have 2 dogs and 2 children under age 4!). It does take more time than I would like, you do need to move slowly to get the floor clean and dry.I would recommend it if you have alot of smooth floors because it beats mopping and hands&knees; cleaning!"
3,Auto shut off works too soon,"While this is a much nicer unit that the spinbrush, the automatic shut off in the water resevoir activates almost constantly. Even when there is no water in the tank the suction is so great that it closes the airflow. This is difficult to deal with since you have to turn off the unit to get suction back. It would be great if Hoover would fix that one small (but aggravating) feature."
4,Track Listing,TRACKS;1.Kernkraft-4:00(DJ Gius Remix)2.Kernkraft-4:00(Original Mix)3.Breakitdown-5:004.Rhythmbox-6:50.
3,More Sunday beer and wine fare,"Theres some pretty tacky samples and cheesey vocals interspersed with your usual beats, but on the whole this is ear friendly fodder. Not bad fare to have sitting in the background whilst chowing down a beverage or three in the afternoon, or to slap on whilst pretending to be cultured when you really have a cd rack full stuffed with motley crue and poison."
1,Disappointing,"We were quite disappointed with this collection. Although the mix of music is good, the sound quality on several of the recordings was unacceptable and the volume fluctuates. For instance, ""Carmina Burana"" was either deafening or completely inaudible."
3,heavy road use,I have used this guitar to retire my Firebird. The only negetive is I put it in the shop about every 3 months. Good trem system but issues with tuning arise. The weight issue is much improved by using a 3 inch wide strap which I use on all my guitars.
4,Worthwhile,"A worthwhile pamplet on the subject, but these days there is much more info on the Internet. We added a hydraulic ram pump calculator to our website that you can find by Googling Borst Engineering & Construction LLC."
4,made Snoozing with Snakes,"For a Christmas present for my nine year old son, my mother (a MASTER QUILTER) and I (a novice) made a quilt from this book. With the exception of how to attach the silly snakes heads, the instructions were clear (and we did manage to figure out this one sticking point) ...and to pat ourselves on the back just a bit, the quilt turned out beautifully.Would I recommend this book to others? Yes.... in fact I have all ready.Was the gift a success? Oh heck yeah! My son LOVES his colourful and fun quilt from Grandtre and mom.Is the a book just for kid's quilts? No sir-re-sir.... this book has a wide variety of quilts in many styles. Really something to gain inspiration from and a keeper in anyone's quilting library."
5,Loved it!,"At first I thought ""what a strange story to tell"" but as I kept reading I was totally hooked. A great read."
5,One of my favs,Please read this book if you love Diane Chamberlain!!! One of her best books!! I can certainly recommend this to all!!
4,Interesting read,"I liked this book as I have with every Diane Chamberlain book I've read. This one was interesting and kept me wanting to read. I did agree with some other reviews that it was a little slower in parts, but I didn't think it was boring. The character development was very good. The twist at the end is worth it. Definitely recommend this book!"
3,The Bay at midnight,"I'd love be able and give this 3.5 stars. It was a good story that flowed smoothly but about 1/3 of the way through the book, I found myself bored. However, the last 1/3 of the story was great. The characters were developed well and I felt awful for Julie... I could've cried for her.The story was about a family who lost a daughter/sister [Isabel]. When Isabel's former boyfriend passed away, his brother was cleaning out his house and found a letter stating that the wrong person went to prison for Isabel's death and the mystery began.I'd definitely recommend for a nice light read but there's not a Diane Chamberlain book that I wouldn't recommend."
3,Still disturbing,"I am still disturbed several days after I've finished this book, even after reading another. I don't know what bothers me the most. The cavalier way the characters dismiss the racism inherent (and I'm not giving away the mystery) in the conviction and death of a falsely accused black teen-aged boy -- or the cavalier way the author uses it as a plot device, only tied up by the most cursory scene.The book's mystery is rewarding, the author's use of the first person is not."
1,THE BAY,"i NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK, AND DO NOT KNOW IF i HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR IT AS i DON NOT YET HAVE MY BILLTHIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEM, JUST GLAD IT IS NOT A REAL COSTLY ONE.NOT SURE IF I'LL TRY AGAIN"
4,Should be in the Business Section,"This is only partly a book on military history; it's also a treatise on leadership and how not to lead. Executives with personal agendas they place ahead of the common good, schadenfreude at the expense of the common good; delusions of grandeur, illusions about the situation at hand, target fixation -- it's all there. Some of our corporate execs of the last few years could have done well to read this sad tale of incompetence and malpractice -- and in this case, it cost actual lives, not just life savings. Well worth reading, for any number of reasons."
3,The right book for the adult wishing for a horse,This is the kind of book that makes you wish you could have someone else drop the kids off at soccer and ballet lessons so you had time to slip into your jeans and head out to the stable. Lotsof photos and stories of girls and women alike who have accomplished that dream. By Claire
4,A sweet group of essays written by women about their horses,"This is really a very sweet book. It would be a perfect gift for a young girl in her early teens that has been bitten by the horse bug. It has over 100 pages, with a large black and white photo on one side, and an essay on the other. Some of the essays are short, some are boring, and some make you wonder why you bought this book. But then you read the ones that bring tears to your eyes and you know why. This book shows us women and the horses they love, and in their own words they tell us a little about themselves and their horse. It's not a glorious coffee table book like GaWaNi Pony Boy's is, but it is a charming book to read and pass along to other women, or our daughters who share our love of horses."
4,Awesome Book,"This book is full of practical tips for Engineers... Just as one might suspect from the title. If your finding yourself wondering what settings to use for bass compresssion or how to get paid, get this book."
2,Don't bother unless you're a total noob to recording,"I am mystified by the 5-star ratings here. For me, this book was a disappointment.If you've ever spent more than a day in a recording studio it's unlikely there is enough meat here to justify the cost of the book. Most of the tips are either dated or painfully obvious.I kept waiting for the meat. But after I'd made it to the last page I realized that there wasn't any.I give it 2 stars rather than 1 because of the writing quality. It's written in a lighthearted style that acknowledges the subject isn't rocket science. I'd love to hang out with the author and talk shop, but I can't recommend his book."
3,not as good as i'd hoped,This book has some good tips but assumes you're working in a pro studio. Some of the material seems a bit dated. They should offer an alternative book for home studios.
2,"Unless this is a direct replacement, don't bother.","Unless this is a direct replacement, don't bother. Construction is such that it will loosen eventually."
1,The North American Bird REference Book,"Counter intuitive, very hard to use, can't easily find an unknown bird. Will not run from hard drive after installation. DON'T BUY !"
1,Not worth $50,The user interface looks like a 2 year old wrote it. Navigation sucks! Can only go forward and backward on a filtered record set. Pictures don't print with documentation. No way to print pictures. Information doesn't tell you what birds like to eat.
3,Teaches the very basics,"This DVD goes over some of the fundamentals, but it does not dig deep enough and does not tell you why to do certain things. It needs to be expanded with the better details for coaches and youth players. I watched this with my son and he learned very few things he had not learned the first 2 weeks of practice."
1,DVD does not play,I purchaesed the video and received it and it did not play on any DVD player I tried. I sent it back for replacement and that one did not play either.
1,Blank DVDs,I ordered one of these DVDs and it was blank; nothing on it. Amazon sent me a replacement and it was also blank. I wasted time and money(before getting a refund) on a product I never was able to use.
3,Kraftwerk Klones,I look at stuff like this as being beneficial ... many today don't properly ascribe the proper place in the pantheon of Techno / Dance / ElectoPop to Kraftwerk that belongs to them. any band which continues to perpetuate the music and pays tribute to kraftwerk deserves attention by aficionados of this style
4,Excellent for relaxation.,"I've had this DVD for several years now and I recommend it very highly if you are looking for pure relaxation.I have anxiety and this is very calming for me. The music is generic enough so that I don't tire of it. The visuals are very compelling and soothing. This is just the thing if you are reading or noodling around online. Now that I know the company makes others, I plan on buying them.Please don't purchase this if you are expecting mind-blowing visuals or music that will change your life - that's not what this is. If you want that, get religion. This is simply a very hypnotic and soothing compilation of music and water imagery. If you have OCD (I do) or other anxiety issues, you will benefit from this over time."
4,Great Resource for Special Needs Children,"I found this handbook to be a great resource, covering things we had no idea we were ""entitled"" to when traveling with our autistic son. There are many benefits built in to Disney World and the theme parks especially for children with special needs. If you need something for your child, JUST ASK!! Most, if not all, park employee's know these benefits, or can direct you to the person who does. When you get the handbook, make sure you have a highlighter to remind you of all the things available, you won't be able to remember them all!!!"
5,Special Needs Visitors to WDW,"Many of us have special needs, from motion sensitivity or allergies to diet or mobility constraints. This book addresses 24 special needs areas for visitors to Walt Disney World. All aspects of the trip are covered in depth, including planning and getting there, choosing where to stay and where to eat, and touring the WDW Resort. Each attraction is described, with tips and warnings for specific special needs covered after their assigned icons (for example, pregnancy has the icon ""E""). This book is a tour de force of research and a worthy reference, indispensable for WDW visitors with special needs. (Steve Barrett, author of the Hidden Mickeys book)."
3,Not much about pregnancy.,I bought this book from a suggestion on another website. The site said there were over 400 pages about pregnancy - but there isn't. There's only 2. I could have done without this book since I already have another travel guide. It is great as a travel guide for other reasons though!
3,Not as good as I had expected :(,"After reading it I feel it would be a good book for families with loved ones w/ Autism spectrum disorders, ADHD and others.The diet coverage did not include as much as I had thought it would.(The reason for my buying the book, that s what I get for ordering before it was in the store to look at) General info is to ask Disney. Not even a link in back for PKU or related metabolic disorders requiring special diets. They list that Disney will work with you. They covered lifestyle, allergies,low sodium, diabetic and religious in the 5 pages on diet. Please read reviews from others to see if this is the book for you, just was not the one for me."
1,Don't leave home without it.,"This book is an invaluable resource for anyone planning a trip to Walt Disney World. As a repeat visitor to WDW I found this book about as informative as it gets, they've thought of just about everthing that may present a problem during your visit. It raises quite a bit of awareness, too. Written by folks who really care about everyone being able to enjoy all that WDW has to offer. I can't say enough."
3,Missing quantitative information,"This book is certainly full of useful information. I recommend it to anyone thinking about riding the Great Divide. Unfortunately, what's missing in this book are quantitative information about the grade and elevation profile of the route. The author usually describes ascents in terms such as ""gnarly"" or ""eye-opening"" or ""grueling"". Rarely will the reader see a hint about actual elevation gain. Given that GPS data is available for the entire route, it would have been trivial to instead provide information such as ""7% average grade for 4 miles"". Better yet, provide the elevation profile of each stage in a separate figure. A secondary complaint is that the gray scale maps aren't too useful. Of course, you are expected to buy the ACA maps (which are great). Over all, this is a fine book, but it could be made significantly more useful with a few simple changes."
5,Great book and great condition,I received this book in a very short time from the moment I ordered it. The book has been exceptionally helpful in my line of business and was in excellent condition.
5,Fantastic Deal!!!,It was the first time I purchased online versus at school bookstore. Great savings and great book!! Will definately buy again.
5,Great Purchase,Definitely would buy again from seller. Book was Brand new and price was unbeatable! Book came right on time.
5,Essentials of Mnagaed Health Care,This text arrived in great condition and is a comprehensive look at all aspects of managed health care over the course of managed care history.
5,Oscar plays tribute to Nat.,"""My favorite instrument"" is probably one of the first CD's made by Oscar. Both Oscar and Nat used to have trio's and made the piano-jazz lovers sway and dream with their bright interpretatons, nuances and even a sometimes hum or just plain singing with the tune. This is a ""must"" for know-hows, who will enjoy time after time these lovely melodies, interpreted with devotion, love and joy! """
5,Cell phone battery,Product is exactly what we needed and description was accurate. Product was well priced and shipped quickly. This was purchased for a relatively and they have been very happy with the product and especially the price.
1,cell phone battery,"will not hold charge,i charged this battery & went to work & within 6 hours without using the phone i checked & it was dead,so i recharged the phone,when i got home it was dead again?? im not going to bother with it,just gonna get another phone."
3,Not quite as advertised...,"The book itself is great, and provides good ideas for putting together a wedding ceremony.The enclosed CD, however, falls short of what is implied in the description. It contains only Appendices A, B, and C (which means you have some useful documents), but it DOES NOT CONTAIN any of the actual text you would assemble into a wedding liturgy - that part, you must type in yourself. That is a significant disappointment, and - since you probably already have questionnaires for people to fill out, and probably a standard bulletin, the CD won't help much. On the other hand, if you are starting from scratch, maybe this is for you.Either way, even the text on the back of the book seems to suggest that the CD-ROM will help you assemble the service. I supposed that is true, but not quite in the way you might expect. I think that Abingdon needs to clarify that in future printings."
2,A book full of boring lists,"This book is quite disappointing... only some meager pages of biography, a handful of rather bad pictures...the rest are boring lists of records, awards etc. I expected much more of this book! I was looking for a load of info along with beautiful pictures."
2,Where is Jayne Baby...,"This book was entirely too exspensive for the content. There was a short dissappointing biography, lists of rather meaningless things, and only a few photos. The author should be ashamed for ignoring the image of Jayne Mansfield and her loving, intelligent personality...the very things that made her famous and keeps her alive in our hearts and minds. Jayne deserves more than a high priced assemblage of paper that offers little to the reader."
4,Works great but it broke after 6 months,"This is a great product. Anything Flexi makes is top quality. It swivels, retracts and and releases the cable smoothly. And it's sturdy as all get-out. The anchor alone will withstand the largest dog pulling at it. I anchored mine to a brick wall and never worry about it coming out.The only thing that went wrong was the snap. The spring and push button broke so now I have to figure out a way to fix it. All in all, I gave it 4 stars. I plan on buying another."
4,good product,Nice convenient product for tying out your dog. It would be nice if there was one for bigger dogs.
4,NOT MY RELEASE,"I am William Olsen, the writer, producer, director of GETTING IT ON, and I'd like to say first off, that everyone is entitled to their opinion. What I want to address here is the transfer of my film negative to DVD. The quality is bad because Liberation is not authorized to release the film and made the transfer from a VHS. I personally produced a slew of extras which include a photo featurette, New York auditions and a trailer, plus my directors commentary. All of this is missing from the Liberation release because their release is unauthorized and illegal. VCI Entertainment is the distributor I made the deal with. I just wanted to goon record staing that the transfer I did was much better."
1,"""Getting nothing on""","Getting it on huh, i watched this farce and absolutely nothing happened it was a phoney sex comedy, no sex and no comedy, one star for effort."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I actually got this mixed up with another similar title from the 80's.anyhow as far as this movie goes I wasn't blown away by it.I'ma sucker for low budget+lowbrow entertainment but this film while in theory was a good idea the execution leaves alot to be desired.It's just not funny enough as comedy nor interesting enough to pass as a drama.The main characters or carricutures as a more appropiate term are generic and really give you no good reason to root for them.the techie nerd who's a poor little rich kid isn't as well developed as say Philly was in Private Lesson's or the luckless in love Gary in The Last American Virgin.I did enjoy the suburban New York setting as oppossed to NYC and the 80's music,dress and technology was fun to see again on screen.The happy ending though cliche was satisfying too.Overall it's an okay movie but there are tons better from the era,"
2,Yuck! Typical Teen Fare,I didn't like this film. I should have saved my money and spent two hours doing something else.
2,Dissapointed,"This movie sounded like it would be a good one to watch after reading the ONE customer review it got. I had wished there were more reviews or even a plot summary posted by Amazon.com, but I thought, ""What the heck, sounds like a movie I'd enjoy."" Well...it wasn't what I thought it'd be at all. Maybe I was expecting too much or just expecting a different type of movie, but I hated watching it. The acting is a little off, the characters aren't likable, and the main character's friend, another horney teen that likes to steal magazines, seems like he'd be happier chasing guys. I didn't live in the 70's or early 80's but if these kids were how teens acted back then, I'm glad I grew up in the ""far more complicated"" time. If you're deciding whether to watch this or not, I suggest you spend your money elsewhere. There aren't many reviews at this point and who knows if you'll like it, but it definitely isn't something special to me."
4,A mixed blessing 4.5,"Pictures at an ExhibitionI liked the book very much, as well as the colorful illustrations. I bought it for my elementary school students. Most third graders could stay with the story without more pictures breaking up the text. (I wouldn't recommend going lower.) My main disapppointment was with the accompanying CD. It was a recording of the piano music, all good and well, but there was only one band so hearing the different musical ""picures"" was difficult. My students cannot stay focused on a thirty-minute piece. I purchased an orchestral recording (on it each section had a separate band) for my students to hear much of the music. Other than this, I would recommend the book highly. I'd give it a FIVE if the piano recording had the bands separating the selections."
3,CD not included,"This is the second book by Celenza and Kitchel that I have purchased (the first was about Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue). The illustrations are beautiful and the story is well written.My complaint is that although it was advertised that a CD recording comes with the book, and the book has a star on the front that says ""Includes CD recording,"" there was no CD. I purchased it at the bargain price, and for $8.78 I will keep the book alone, especially since others have said that their replacement books also did not include a CD. I will use YouTube or other free services for recordings of the music.I recommend the book itself, and I would have been happy to pay $8.78 for a book without a CD if it had been described that way, but I'm annoyed by false advertising. It should not be described as including a CD if, in fact, there won't be one because you purchased a bargain hardcover or a paperback copy."
1,No CDs included,"I've just got my TWO ordered hardcover copies (one of the copies is supposed to be a gift to a friend). For now I give this item only 1 star, because both books come WITHOUT CDs! Both copies though have stickers on them saying the CD comes with the book.So I guess I will only be able to review the item after I get the set completed..."
5,Wonderful teaching tool.,"I coordinate outdoor workshops for women to provide them the opportunity to learn new skills. We hosted a new class,Nature Journaling, and the instructor needed a book to suplement her curriculum. I selected this book based on the Amazon recomendations and further research. Both the instructor and participants loved the book. It was very helpful and useful once they left the workshop.I think this book is a great resource in any EE/nature/writing library."
4,inspirational,"inspiring illustrations, good guidepoints to starting your own journal, empowering so that even the less ""artist-types"" feel they can do this. Emphasis is not on technique or end result, but on the process of observing. Well done."
2,nice try,"I was deeply disappointed by the so-called ""return of the funk"" with the Headhunters reuniting with their original lineup. As compared to Herbie Hancock's original ""Headhunters"" release, the Return of the Headhunters is missing one main ingredient, the grease. This recent release has traded the ""grits and gravy"" created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers, for over-produced smooth jazz-funk, complete with overused N'Dea Davenport R&B hooks that left this album flat."
3,bah,"It's of medium quality as compared to all of the other jazz/funk/fusion at that time, but if you buy this cd expecting to hear anything like the first headhunters/thrust albums, you will be disapointed"
2,No Return To Glory,For those who remember the Survival Of the Fittest album from back in the day -- forget about it. This is not even close to that one. Completely forgettable.
4,okay,"to like this you must be a jazz fan, not spaced out, or edgey like their sesions back in the man child-thrust days but still listenable like i said to like this you must be a light jazz fan, still herbie, and the boys deserves props for being artound this long."
4,GOOD SOLID RELEASE !,"Best production/recording values of ANY Headhunters release to date. Second best creative effort of any Headhunters release to date: ""Survival.."" was OUT THERE... like Hancock's Sextet albums(Mwandishi, Sextant, Crossings.. put Julian Priester's ""Love, Love"" and Maupin's ""Jewel Of The Lotus"" in there, too!. I also like Henderson's ""Sunburst"" a lot, but it's different, more like Cannonball Adderly). I digress... ""Return.."" is a FUNK SATISFACTION album. Not a ton of spacy stuff like ""Survival.."", but some. Lots of Jackson and Maupin streatching out the not-so-commercial grooves into something more. Lots of solid pieces/performances. I miss Blackbird's crazy distorted guitar solos (which show up on the album ""Straight From The Gate""). Also I gotta note, POSITIVE VIBES! These are happy people playing this music!Overall this is a good solid release. as an ol'fan I'm very pleased with it."
1,Totally useless,"This product is very hard to use. It bends when you try to grab the contact making it nearly impossible to get the contact out of the eye. This little piece of rubber is definitely not worth the money. In my opinion, a fair price would be 50 cents."
1,contact lens inserter/remover,the contact surfaces with the lenses are not large enough nor pliable (soft).The whole contraption is an aqwuard design to hold and manipulate. Do you have other options? Something like a vacuum cup?
2,opti gear soft lense,this did not work well for me so i will keep trying to find the right thing for me to use.
2,Too soft,"The product got to me very fast, and was as described. I have a very hard time taking my contacts out so I ordered 3 types of available removers. I am still trying to get the hang of using it, I wish it was a little more rigid. I prefer the Lobob Soft Contact Insertion/Removal Kit for removing my contacts. I never had problems putting them in so I can't evaluate that."
5,My kids love this book!,"My 3-year-old received this book for Christmas and can't get enough of it. I choked up a little the first time I read it to her. It kind of reminded me of ""Love You Forever"", except the mom is cool and stable rather than being a delusional stalker. Although the ending was predictable, it was so incredibly sweet that I fell in love with the book, as well. My six-year-old loves it, too. She asks me about the things I've done in my life. A great conversation starter."
1,Worthless,"I don't know if I've got a defective unit or not but I've had the thing running for nearly three days in a room about 250 square feet and the thermostat still says 77 degrees (I've got it set for 68). This is awful. In the morning I get colder air by putting a fan in my window. This is nothing more than a very expensive fan. I'm horribly disappointed with this machine and caution others against it.Additionally, the exhaust kit doesn't fit my standard window opening and the exhaust tubing gets super hot. So, there's a battle between the marginal coolness of the unit versus the unendurable heat of the exhaust. Lucky me."
1,Haier portable a/c,First year worked well. we purchased a/c heater unit. Winter came heater unit didn't work. Customer service would not do anything about the unit. 2nd year it could not keep up with humidity and leaked even though drained...read some reviews where it will not keep up with high humidity areas. Just for the sheer lack of customer support for warranty coverage I would not recommend this brand. Very disappointed when 3rd summer it quit completely...
5,VERY SATISFIED!!!,I ordered this for my mother and she loves that it comes in a smaller bottle and it has a dropper!!!
3,I barely rememebr buying this,"I barely remember buying this. I had a really clogged ear about half a year ago, to the point where you can't HEAR anything out of it. I don't remmeber where the bottle went, it must not have impressed me enough to hold on tight to. But fromm what I can remember, it did not work buy itself, but used some cool syringe thing I also purchased off Amazon that worked amazing. The syringe could have possibley just worked with water, so this may not have needed to been bought...Actually, my ears are starting to fill up with wax again, now that I think about it. I will try to track this bottle down and give it a second try and post an update."
5,"Good Condition, Good Book","This book was in good condition as describe by the seller. Some highlighted marks, but it was as discussed by the seller. So thumbs up."
5,"Great writing, excellent instrumentation... nicely done.","Being a DJ, you tend to listen to music a little differently. This music is so well written. The are ways to use music to effect a person's mood based upon how humans respond to certain tones in music. This stuff is great to listen to, even as background music while you work. It just puts you in such a great place.The performers are top notch. I've been following both Andy West's and Joaquin Lievano's careers for some time now after first listening to Zazen. They both truly are world class musicians that are regrettedly being overlooked by the industry for how well this music is. It could easily blow anything away Yanni or Kitaro ever did. Not to slight them in the LEAST! I love their music. But there is real talent among these guys.Highly recommended!"
3,good guitar work,Joaquin Lievano & Andy West (ex Dixie Dreggs) make a great team. Nice New Age driving with the wife stuff.
3,"Not special, but still a nice little book","As the title indicates, this book focuses on the cooking a Kerala, a small state down at the south-western tip of India known for its rich home-grown spices. That being said, some of the dishes, such as the Vindaloo and Biriyanis are more northerly in character, while a lot of the rest, while obviously southern, are not so vastly different from many dishes one might find in a more general book on Indian Cuisine. The recipes are very nice, though, and are well-written and easy to follow. There is also a good textual introduction to Kreala and its cuisine at the beginning of the book. I thought a little bit more material in spice-blending would have been better, but the individual masalas provided for most recipes are nicely balanced. I probably would have awarded four stars if there was an illustration accompanying each recipe."
1,Not a book but a coloring book,I was under the impression that this was an actual book that I could read to my child but it is a coloring book on that awful cheap gray looking coloring book paper not even the nice white kind.
2,Dubble check your serial #,Description of item was not very good it was suppose to fit my car but I had to make a adapter to get it to work
3,not what I expected,I was expecting this to be a book with in-deoth information about a few special Americans. Instead there was a painting of each of many people with a quote from each. And in the back of the book there was a paragraph about each.. I found it to be disappointing. Where I got my expectation from I'm not sure.
1,Anti-American radicals upheld as 'role models for citizenship',"This book for high-school students glorifies communists, socialists and at least one activist who has called for ""resistance"" against the U.S. government.The book does not inform readers of the extremist backgrounds of the personalities upheld as heroes when in fact they are all simply Anti-American radicals upheld as 'role models for citizenship'"
1,Great Book if You Hate America and All it Stands For,"If you hate America and everything it stands for, and if you hate Israel, the ONLY free democracy in the Middle East, and if you believe in anarchy, destruction of private and public property and violence, then this is absolutely the book for your kids! This book will teach them to love some of the most anti-American, dishonest people in the history of our country.It's stunning if you understand the sickness promoted by this book, and that several of the folks in here have been widely discredited as dishonest. Do a little research before you fill your kids' heads with this junk."
1,"This isnt a serious book, right?","I am not a right winger nor am I a left winger, but I am certainly a person who can see that this book is bias to the core. I mean c'mon...Emma Goldman?! She was an anarchist terrorist in the early 1900's. W.E.B Du Bois was a Stalinist racial seperatist that masked himself off as a Civil Rights leader. Chomsky and Zinn are deconstructionalist malcontents who are admired by the radical left and are even touted by radical Islamists. Goodman is a hack journalist who runs an overtly bias radio program.This book cannot be taken seriously and I hope it remains within the inner circle of the hard left crowd. The sad thing is that they're trying to pander this off to children. For shame..."
1,Pure garbage,"The author is a liar himself, so you can take the title with a grain of salt. Imagine holding up Howard Zinn, author of""The People's History of the United States"", as an example of 'Americans who tell the truth'. Zinn's text( a ""history"" text which cites not one single source), a vapid collection of balderdash, feverish wishful thinking and outright deliberate lies, is one of the texts used by Marxist academics to indoctrinate college students with an invented version of American history.The title of this piece of dreck should be ""Marxists Who Can't Tell The Truth"". What a reeking pile of hassayampa. Waste your money on this trash if you like, but now you've been warned. This is the kind of garbage being pushed on our children in the public schools. Is it any wonder that kids today can't even tell you which century the War of Independence was fought?"
2,What's missing...........,"Much has been left out about these people....Abraham Lincoln for instance said the Negro should never be allowed to vote.....I found with a little research this is just another book about the ""disenfranchised"" not about a nation where freedom and liberty made it possible for them to rise to the ranks they did without some struggle....was it for self in some instances? Or was it for the good of all. This is one of the questions this man's book does not approach very clearly in my view.I would not want my child reading such bias....I would rather he or she read these histories by men and women who love their country and show how hard work can often lead to a better life.JMS"
1,it is incomplete and expansive,"i am telling you just don't buy stuff from this store. The cable is expansive like 5-7 $, it is incomplete and the quality is really poor."
1,Horrible Sound,"You can only just hear the lead instrument playing... I *think* the music is really good, but you wouldn't be able to tell by this recording"
4,Good Text on Windows 2000 Server,"I used this text and the MCSE Guide to Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional for the Install 2000 Professional/Server course this summer at a local community college. The text is well written and strives to match Microsoft's MCSE Exam for Installing, Configuring, and Administering Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. The extensive hands-on projects provided practice skills for my students. As an instructor, I appreciated the extensive course materials (chapter outlines, PowerPoint presentations, test generators).I would recommend that prospective test takers purchase a practice test. Perhaps the TestOut LabSim (Windows 2000 Server Lab Simulator) and practice test."
4,great follow up,"I could not disagree more with the previous review. Although the first ablum is probably stronger, the second is a great follow up. Most people just don't get this band. I saw em last Friday in LA, and I will never view ""to drunk to F*ck"" the same way again. Moreover for the live preformances, the songs were tricked out different from the album recordings. I grew up with these songs to, and love these versions. If it was not for KCRW I would have never heard of this band, somehow, I don't think that KCRW is known for playing bands that stink."
3,so and so,"I was familiar with their music when I bought this CD, but after listening to it twice, it has become boring. Same type of music over and over again, same type of voice, etc. Maybe it's just me, but now my CD is confined forever in the bookcase."
3,Nice picture bad network,The unit works perfectly until you try to get windows XP and Mediagate to cowork.This results in me moving the product to the computer and hook it up with USB.I would give it some more stars if the network worked.
1,Bad product,"Is very difficult programing and really have bugs, and dont work fine, i dont reccomended, im wait that work better that appletv but......im wait apple tv"
5,Easily Five Stars; The one to get!,"This is the 1980 recording of L'Estro Armonico (originally released, I believe, in 1981). This double-decker cd also includes the 1977 recording of the Six Flute Sonatas op.10, making this a great bargain. Compared to the boring recording by Marriner (which also featured Hogwood performing) and other ""romantic"" interpretations, it's a joy to hear Vivaldi played with such joy and vigor. The previous reviewer reported that he had the 1981 Decca recording by Hogwood and wasn't sure if this was the same: rest assured, this is the same 1980 recording (released in '81) and remains the best. One would by hard pressed to find a brighter, more vibrant recording of L'Estro Armonico."
3,digging up the pharmacology,"i found this book to be kind of easy to read..the writing might not agree with some students but it did with me.. however i'm not saying it's totlly complete,not like lippincott pharmacology..but for some one who wants a last minute review and fast..this is the book.u might try using another review book to supplement it perhaps the made ridiculosly pahrmacolgy..if u use both these books u'll cover every thing."
3,Touch and Feel Kitten,"This is not the best of the Touch and Feel books. The variety of textures is limited and my daugther seems less interested in this book than the farm, wild animals and baby animals versions, even though she loves cats."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"We have two cats at home, so ""CAT"" is the only word besides ""MAMA"" and ""DADA"" that our 10-month old says. She loves flipping through the sturdy cardboard pages and petting the furry cat on the front. And, of course, saying ""CAT"" as she does this."
4,touch and feel kitten,"this is a good book if u have young childeren about 1-2 years young.it is very interactive and will teach your kidswhat a cat feels like,and its tounge,its tags,fur,food bowl,and a straw basket."
4,2 cat textures & 3 non-cat ones,"At 10 months my daughter became fascinated with our house cat but he wouldn't sit around long enough for her to poke at him so we decided to get her the next best thing -- touch & feel books! This one features a white furry chest, pink rough tongue, smooth shiny tag, hard yellow bowl & scratchy straw basket -- only 2 are actually cat textures. I think they should've done one with the cat's whiskers, like in the other Touch & Feel book: Pets. Or one of the cat's padded paws would be nice too... My daughter skips right over the yellow bowl & shiny tag pages."
2,making perfect landings in light airplanes,"Was hoping for new insights or suggestions for better landings, but it was just a hash over of the normal teachings."
4,great book,"This is a great book for one to understand basic concepts in coastal engineering. It is not very mathematical and hence it is very useful to complement other references and research papers that are more rigerous, especially to those undertaking self study or refreshing their skills in coastal engineering and wave mechanics."
1,I was ripped off,"goHastings ripped me off by not sending me this CD. They took the money out of my account but never sent the CD! I will never order anything that is sold by goHastings and if your smart, none of you will either!"
1,Countless Errors! Will Do More Harm Then Good.,"Do not buy this book! Besides the presence of countless sloppy typos, French speakers just don't use many of the phrases in the book. Many are simply absurd, literal translations that a junior high french student would try to throw together. I'm curious if the author is even fluent or spent any time in a French speaking country. In the dedication she thanks her ""patient, proofreader husband"". I laughed out loud. I have never seen more typos in any published work, nor any language guide with so many ridiculous translations that are NEVER used. One, two, even a few would be acceptable, but this is out of control. This book will get you bewildered glances from French speakers from Quebec, to Port Au Prince to Paris. Stay away. And be sure to check closely any other books by the same author in the series. It looks like she has many. Let's hope a French speaking editor checked those and not a family member."
2,information outdated,The author needs to update this book! There are a number of trips that start on private property and should not be included. One in particular is at the Audubon Trail in Sanderling (located in the town booundaries of Duck). The only access to the sound at this point is from the Sanderling Racket and Swim Club which is private property.
1,missing critical information,I used this book to plan a trip to Lake Mattamuskeet in January but the author fails to note that the lake is actually closed to kayakers every year until March 1st. Makes me wonder what else is wrong in this book.
3,Great gift for a friend.,"Must like kayaking, but bought this for a friend. there are lots of trails in there for the state of NC"
4,"I have used many of her trails, but disappointed by Bald Head Island.","Felt that Bald Head Island trail was the not so impressed type of trail. And in fact was sort of annoying. The cost of 15.00 per person, 8.00 per child for ferry ride, and oh, by the way you must pay for the kayaks as well, at 15.00 per pop, then you get to the island, and they tell you that you can't put in where Pam indicates, that you have to truck your kayak all the way to the northern side of where the ferry pulls in (our kayaks are rather large, and heavy and with 2 kids who don't really truck their own kayaks around, this could be very crucial informaiton.However, we have used Pam's trails up and down the outerbanks, and down wrightsville beach, and have been pretty happy overall, however, don't reccommend the Bald Head Island trip, for nothing!"
2,Disappointing,"Dead Tech -A Guide to the Archaeology of Tomorrow dates from 1981, with the English version in 1982 and a 2000 reprinting. Its coverage of dead factories, rail-yards, harbors, and aircraft boneyards is a disappointment. Manfred Hamm's inconsistent mixture of black & white and color photographs give the book a disjointed feeling. The quality of the photographs themselves is inconsistent. A few rise to the level art exhibited by Stanley Greenberg (Invisible New York) and Christopher Payne (New York's Forgotten Substations), while most are no better than I (a decidedly amateur photographer) might have done in a hurry with my trusty Pentax K1000 and a roll of T-Max 100 or Ektachrome 64. The accompanying text by Rolf Steinberg is noisome -- perhaps a victim of a less-than-artful translation into English. I haven't yet decided whether I will hold on to this book."
1,"Amateur Pictures; Overly Emotional, Whiny Text","I just got this book today. I flipped through it and was not at all impressed with the photography. Any amateur could take those shots. Then I started to read it. The first section of text, ""The Ruins Complex"" by Robert Jungk is terrible. As a scientist I was unspeakably annoyed at his melodramatic, disparaging attitude towards R&D and his overall theme that all technology is facing imminent breakdown resulting in possible inconvenience but more likely disaster. Throw this book on your coffee table if you want visitors to think you have poor tastes. On top of it all, the book seems to be poorly bound. My copy looks to be in excellent condition but I can see the thread holding the pages in and it feels like its going to come apart every time I flip a page. Skip it, its not worth even the shipping costs."
4,"It has shortcomings, but this is a great book of decaying industrial settings","Some of the photography is of amateur quality, and some of the text is inessential. But on the whole, this is a good set of photos (from the early 1980s) of decaying industrial sites. Pick it up at a low price and you'll be happy with it!"
4,"A photo book of phenomenal measures, but with too many words","I found this book pretty, but it had alot of words in it. I was hoping for more photography. The pictures is does contain are stunning, powerful and very, very ""Dead Tech""."
4,The Music and Message of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions,The video was great particularly not regularly seen performance footage.The video was very informative with awesome music.
2,curtis mayfield and the impressions the music and the message,"I WAS FOR SURE THAT I WOULD SEE SOME OF THE IMPRESSIONS EARLY VIDEOS SUCH AS KEEP ON PUSHING , SAD GIRL AND BOY ,GYPSY WOMAN, AND SO ON."
5,AMEN,"Okay, first of all, I'm prejudiced. The Impressions are my all time favorite group (besides The Magnificent Men). Curtis Mayfield's writing is some of the best to ever come out of any genre. To see the clips of when we were all young, is a joy. To hear the interviews and the personal observations is a great experience.If you love R&B;, the way it's supposed to be, buy this!"
2,movin on up curtis mayfield and the impressions,"quality of the interivews with the wife and members of the group were right on and very good. Very informative.However, the sound quality of the recordings were not good!- I will not show this DVD to my home vistors again -it was downright horrific!"
5,Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions : A Video Biography,"I truly enjoyed viewing the Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions DVD. It was like a video biography of the life of Curtis Mayfield with the Impressions and as a solo artist. This video will give you the chance to hear what he and the Impressions were thinking about and dealing with when the music was made. There are also excellent commentaries from his wife, the other two Impressions and others particularly Andrew Young. You will also enjoy the live performances. If you were a fan of Curtis and his music, this is a MUST HAVE! I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,A nice songsmith,"Radigan is little known, but she is very good at crafting tunes. She has a element of ""Fresh and Unique"" that is worth purchasing. There's a hint of jazz in places, blues, country... my fave is the song ""everything starts out small""... sounds like it could be a 'Bond' song."
5,Squeak Relief review,This stuff really works and it IS waterproof which is very important to me being that its been raining non stop for the past few weeks here and my rotors have not rusted at all. Very pleased and I will use this with every future brake job from now on.
5,A Gift Of Life,"Anita Brookner has penned another masterpiece...This is not just writing, but literature at the highest level. Her ability to pierce the uncertainty of older age along with her perception of life's realities is stunning. To many of her readers, this perception hits home and so does the realization for those of us who have reached this age...we are not alone."
3,Nothin' never happens here,"All the stars I give this book are based on the excellent writing, not the riveting plot. There is no plot. Maybe it's the mood I'm in these days. At another time and in another place, I might find Julius interesting. I kept dozing off while reading. Then, when I'd pick the book up again, I couldn't find my place because because every page seemed the same. Julius is forever shrouded in greyness and inaction. I was relieved that two other reviewers (who also like Brookner) felt the same, so I don't have to feel totally shallow."
4,Works very well,I am a karaoke dj. I have worked with Shure mics in the past and these are the same quality. Sound is really good. I really like the battery indicator on the mic. The box it comes in is very sturdy and nice. It is very very worth it. The only thing I haven't figured out is that when the mics are turned off there is a little static sound that pops up from time to time but if you leave the mics turned on and on mute then there is no interference. But overall I highly recommend these mics for any small gig or even large ones. If you are a serious professional church or singer then I would go with shure mics but you are talking at least 400$ more. These mics are the nicest mics for the money hands down. I would definitely buy them again if I needed more. Thanks
3,"Good at first, one dead couple month later!","I've bought many different mics for karaoke. I was aiming for affordable ones! This pairs was okie when I first received it, it has multi-channel (you don't need many channel for home user). The receiver has a nice design and fit it with the system!BEWARE!! NOT RECOMMENDED!3 months without using it, we turn it back on to find out one of them is dead! I try new battery, set new channel, swap channel, does not work! Only thing come out of it is static noise. I should've invested some more into a better pair without waste my money on cheap mics."
2,need help or i need to returm,"well i just have a question? I am not professional with this kind of electronics stuff, but I have other brand of microphone that i use for my kids show, i both this in addition to what i have and also because of previous review from other costumers. but it squick so bad iether with other microphone hooked up or just by it self and if i turn down the volume to get rid of the squicking sound i dont have any sound in microphone at all, i tried everything i can do for 4 hours but did not figure out how to get it work without squicking, i need somone to help me solve this other wise I have to return it.thank you.Hisonic HSU482H 48-Channel Dual UHF 600MHz Wireless Microphone, FCC Certified"
3,Encyclopedia,"The author is certainly knowledgeable and if you are looking for an encyclopedic book which mentions all bands in last 50 years you may enjoy the book. If you are looking for a story - how certain styles developed, why were they influential - then it is a painful reading. An average paragraph mentions 4-5 band names. If you know rock music well, the book may help to remind bands you have long forgotten and help to group the bands under specific music styles. But I'm not sure that you would learn much more than that from this book.The author also comes out with strong opinions without argumentation, e.g. Elvis Presley is one of the most overestimated musicians. This may be true, but it depends what kind of influence are we talking about - music itself, music business, youth culture. Nobody can throw out a statement like this just with one sentence."
1,Get the facts right.,"Frightwig wasn't a lesbian band. Since when is being assertive and creative a trait for being a lesbian.Sorry to wreck your world, band members left when they got pregnant and it wasn't immaculate conseption or a turkey baster."
5,"Not Just for Bourbon, IMHO","Been through about 10 of these over the years. They don't take well to being gently knocked over on a granite counter. But that is not a criticism of the of the glass, just evidence that I am a clumsy oaf.I use these glasses for various single malt scotches and my favorite tequila (Don Julio 1942). They seem to work very well for all of them.Without a doubt, my favorite glass."
3,drill,THE TUNERS PMMH-015 THAT ARE GIBSON REPLACEMENTS YOU MUST DRILL THE HEAD STOCK !!!IF YOU HAVE THE OLD STYLE TUNERS!!THIS WAS NOT CLEAR WHEN I PURCHASED MINE!SO BE SURE BEFORE YOU BUY !!!THEY COULD HAVE PROVIDED THIS INFO
2,It's films like this that make me think Bigfoot is fictional.,"It reminded me of ""The Blair Witch Project"" except it was way more boring, but on the plus side I didn't get motion sickness. I think they might have pulled it off, but the video of the Bigfoot's head behind the grassy knoll was kinda cheesy. I guess it also reminded me of going on a walk in the woods after a warm snow with some dude that keeps whispering and won't shut up.I can't in good conscience recommend this video.... well... except the scenery was nice. 2 Stars"
1,dont waste your money,"This is crap. There's horrible footage of something's Head, no features just a shape that could've been a bear or a person. It's a waste of 2 bucks."
5,Excellent way to store all Barbies!,"This is a neat, compact way to keep all Barbies in one place. It is sturdy plastic, has a roller handle so kids don't have to carry it and it has some storage on top for accessories. It's a great way to keep everything together."
3,Great concept,I ordered this for an 11 year old granddaughter. I thought it would be a good container for some of her barbies and doll accessories. It isn't as sturdy as I thought it would be and the latch doesn't close like it should. I would not buy it again unless they updated the problem first.
3,Barbie box,"Disappointed that the box is not divided . If box not filled , Barbie fall , not to keep them ."
3,It's OK.,"This has great potential to being a great storage bin. You must be very sure the top is down tight or it flies open. Also, when it is closed and you open to get into the larger bit the tiny shoes and accessories fly out of the hole on top. This should be fixed so things don't get lost."
1,Disappointed Grammie,"I thought this would be perfect when my daughter-in-law reccommended it, unfortunately it arrived broken. I decided that if it could hold up to shipping, it wouldn't hold up to my four year old grand-daughter. Good idea but not worth the price. Not ""Barbie"" quality."
2,"Nice idea, but...","Nice idea, but it's very cheaply made. You would be far better off buying a plastic fishing tackle box with the smaller tray in the top to store everything in. But...it wouldn't say ""Barbie"" on it and it wouldn't be pink. Then again, it would be higher quality and cost less. This is not at all well made, and I will be very surprised if it stands up to opening and closing for more than a few months."
2,poor quality,"bad latches, dont buy this if you want it to last. cute but not worth more than a few bucks due to poor quality."
3,its ok,"This item is ok, its a good place to store barbies, however, it is not super sturdy. several of the hinges have broken off. The lid will stay on but you can no longer open it the way it was intended to be opened. My duaghter has to completely remove the lid as opposed to flipping it open. It has dond a great job of keeping barbie and accessories together."
3,Junk hinges!,"Before purchasing this item I read many of the reviews on this site. Most people had mentioned that the hinges were hard to open and their children needed help to get them off, I thought this would be a good thing so my daughter would have to bring it to me for help, or at least her baby sister could not open it to dump all of the accessories out. WRONG!!!... I just received the container yesterday, it does a wonderful job of holding the Barbies, BUT all of those compartments for accessories is useless, the hinges flip open every time you lift the lid. Even my 18 month old is capable of opening the smaller compartments on top to dump everything out, I am just using a zip-lock bag inside the large compartment to hold all of the smaller items... to say the least I am a bit disappointed with this $35 storage container, I should have just purchased a piece of girls carry-on luggage!"
5,Barbie Store It All - Pink,"Wow! This is awesome!!! Holds lots of Barbies, has a great compartment for clothes, and another good compartment for all of the smaller accessories. The wheels roll smooth on the floor and carpet, and the pull handle is just the right length to make it comfortable for a little girl!"
3,Rolling cart,Cute item. It is a bit flimsy for our intended use. A little heavier quality plastic would certainly be more sturdy but it is holding up fine for now.
3,Barbie Store It All,I am not so pleased with this item. The top part to put accessories is very hard to open and the lids will not last that long with a toddler opening/closing. This product is not durable at all.
3,Barbie Store It All! Doll and Accessory Rolling Bin,"I bought two Barbie Rolling bins for my granddaughters, age 5 and 8. The bin is fine, but the plastic handle which you use to pull the bin is flimsy at best."
4,Needs bigger compartments,"First of all, just let me say I can't believe this is selling for about sixty dollars here on Amazon! I purchased mine at a local Target for about 25 dollars. There were only two left, and I made sure to snag the one without the scratches. ~he he he~ It's pretty sturdy. Although there are storage compartments for the accessories, I find they aren't big enough to accomodate all of them (hence the four stars). Over all, I'm pretty pleased with my purchase. Now, if only I can get my daughter to remember to put the Barbies ""in"" the bin and not stack them on ""top"" of it! *siiigh*"
2,Barbie Case not so hot!,"This Barbie Case was not very sturdy. The top of it did not even close properly. Instead of playing Barbie with it, the little girl (age 4) sat on it and scooted around the house. When leaving for home...she left it here to play with the next time she came back."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was the biggest piece of garbage! I could have done better going to Wal-Mart and buying a plastic tote and putting Barbie stickers on it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It is made of thin plastic and when I received it, it wasn't even put together properly (one of the hinges on the plastic compartment in the lid wasn't functional). I am seriously contemplating returning this item, except for the fact that my daughter's birthday is in 2 days."
3,A little disappointing,"One reviewer said that there was something that held the Barbies in place in this product, but it is just an empty bin once you lift up the lid with the compartments in it. One of the pictures showed clear sides so you could see the Barbies, but it is pink plastic. The handle is flimsey, but I doubt my granddaughter will be pulling it around much. It will still be a place for her to store her Barbie stuff so I think she will like it."
3,Great for doll but not accessories,"I was looking for something that would hold my daughter's barbie dolls and keep the accessories from overtaking the house. While there is plenty of room on the bottom for the dolls, the compartments on top are sorely lacking in actual space to hold anything. May need a separate container just for the clothes and accessories!"
4,Barbie Store It All,Great for keeping smaller dolls and barbies up off floor and out of the way. My little girl enjoys pulling it around as well.
2,Don't buy online,This case is made of hard plastic. Mine got pretty bruised in shipping. I would only recommend buying this in the store to ensure it arrived undamaged. Another disadvantage is that the top storage area doesn't latch and the handle is pretty useless. Not so sure I would have bought this if I saw it in person first.
2,It's ok but not fabulous,"I was a little disappointed when I received this. I should've read the reviews first but I forgot. I agree that the handle is pretty flimsy and although they haven't fallen off yet, I don't hold a lot of hope for the doors of the top compartments. I also agree with someone who said they thought there would be compartments to slip the barbies down into, standing up. Instead, the main holding area is just a big empty bin, no compartments or anything. I got this with a gift certificate so I think we'll keep it but really, I think you could do just as well with a big plastic bin from Wal-Mart or Target. I think it's extremely over priced for the lack of quality in the materials."
2,The lid comes off easily and spills accessories everywhere,"The lid comes off easily and since the accessories store in the lid's top, they spill everywhere. Poor design makes this impossible to use correctly. We have had it for a few years now and all it does is store barbies. It isn't portable and it doesn't do anything more than a rubbermaid bucket would do."
4,$70 for a $20 plastic storage case??,"This product is $20 everywhere else. Target has them on line and in stores.It is pink plastic material and perfect for storing Barbie dolls, shoes and clothes.Don't be crazy.....Never spend $70 on a plastic storage case that is 12"" x14"" (approx)"
3,poor quality,"A poor quality bin. Although the bin shape looks exactly like that on the picture, but there is no sticker/picture of the barbie dolls as shown on the picture."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,I was really considering this for our daughter until I actually seen this. Don't waste your money...I didn't!!! Before buying this just buy a clear rubbermaid container. And for small stuff you can go to Walmart and buy a hair accessory case container that has the tray in it. Rubbermaid container you will get use of after the Barbie stage is over and the hair accessory case you will get longer use of as well plus all the hair stuff that comes in it.have to say NO to this Barbie product!!!
4,pink convenience,item is very useful for storage of all those small barbie items and the wheels on it are handy to say the least
5,awesomes storage,i was happy because it held all of her barbies including the clothes that always get lost. great purchase tokeep things organized
3,oma's review,"I loved the idea of one big bin for all the dolls but would have preferred a stronger plastic for the lids on the top of the bin to be used for smaller items, as the one we purchased has already snapped. I know that assumnption is not a good thing, therefore, I was quite surprised to see the bin was a solid color. It was not mentioned in the description and as I said I just assumed it was clear."
3,Good Storage for Barbies,"I bought this for my daughter for her 5th birthday. It is pretty big and holds all your Barbies, accessories, etc. My only complaint is after 2 months of use, the handle broke off and the top lid has broken off."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed because when you look at the picture it looks like there are slots for the barbies to stand around the outside and you could see each doll. I assumed that was how it was made with open area in the middle for clothes etc. Actually, you open the lid and it is a big open area. It will make clean up and carting around easy but there is no organizational benefits to it. Wish it had bins for each doll."
4,cute caddy,i bought this for my boyfriends niece who has tons of barbies and needs a tote for travel...this is a good size...can't hold more than probably 10 barbies but has separate compartments for extras like shoes and clothes...i woulda been stoked if i was 5 and got this and im sure she will be too
3,not great,This does the job of storing my daughter's barbie dolls but the storage compartments on the lid (for clothes and accessories) are completely worthless. The compartments open up spilling all contents out as soon as my daughter lifts the lid to get barbies out.
2,Barbie Stor it all not quite up to what I thought,"This product does store Barbies, true. But it looked to have more secure storage spaces than it does. Where you would store the little items it does not lock down so they can spill out. Also where the barbies are stored it says it stores up to 20, that is standing side by side. If you store that many dolls there is no place for clothes. And the plastic that it is made of is quite thin, not good quality overall. It was a bit of a disappointment although my 4 yr old grand daughter feels it is OK. She smiled but then it was made in pink, her favorite color."
3,barbie carrier on wheels,"Barbie dolls fit nicely in container, easy to cart by little children, no assembly required. Average quality of container, pricey for size. I believe we pay more for the ""Barbie"" name, than quality of container."
3,"Nice size, but flimsy","Nice size for plenty of storage, but lid does not fasten securely and handle is very weak. Could be easy to break for most children."
4,Organize her Dolls,"Has compartments on top for doll clothes, shoes etc. Holds up to 20 Barbies but has a very flimsy handle."
3,Just ok,My 3 year old had the top snapped off within the hour. Otherwise lots of room to store babies and she loves to drag it around.
2,Poor durability,Difficult to open the top boxes as an adult so my daughter struggles and they will break. It's practical to keep everything contained but it will only last a few weeks
2,Disappointed,"I hate writing bad reviews, but this product kinda' deserves it. The good point: (yes, singular) The box is large enough to hold more than 20 Barbies and ""some"" of their gear. Other than that, I think the product is flimsy and overpriced. The handle comes off when my kids pull on it and the wheels don't really roll all that well so the box tips over when either kid attempts to pull it from room to room. The lid hinge broke the first time I opened it and, since it's plastic, there's no way to repair it. The only reason I did not return the box is that I really wanted the dolls off of the floor right at THAT moment. Had my OCD not gotten the better of me, it would've gone back. This product could be vastly improved upon by getting rid of the wheels and making it a carry case (with a nice, thick handle on the top). If it were more of a tackle box (or toolbox) design (with the clothes/shoe tray a little larger and more useful), it would be the perfect storage container."
3,Breaks easily,I bought this to keep my daughters barbies better organized. My only problem with it is the lid broke so easily. It doesn't snap shut any longer. But it still serves its purpose.
3,It's ok.,"I wish they still made the barbie storage cases I had when I was a child. This does a fine job but it's just not very sturdy. The hinges are cheap and will break easily. It stores a good amount of barbies and accessories. Both of my girls (4 and 2) love to drag it around by the handle. They're happy with it, and I guess that's all that matters."
4,Barbie Storage,"This product is great for storage, the pull handle isn't as durable as I'd hope. Overall I'd give this product OK rating for the price."
5,Verbruggen is wonderful,"I very much agree with the above review! (Though I have not taken classes with Verbruggen ... envy!) No one plays recorder at the level of Marion Verbruggen, and these pieces are a perfect match for her unique vision and talent."
5,Bill Cunningham NY,Great and entertaining doc on a very humble photographer- yet a legend I was unfamiliar with. Enjoyed seeing New York's history through his lens and meeting the personalities he has worked with since the 50s. For those of you who consider yourselves to be 'creative' people- this is a must see and quite inspirational.
2,Quirky,"Watched this doc for a course assignment at psych institute. Quirky guy, nicely made doc... But wouldn't necessarily watch it for entertainment."
5,"Thank you, Bill Cunningham...","Prior to watching this documentary, I knew nothing of Bill Cunningham. All I can say now is, the time spent watching Bill Cunningham work...well, not really work, he's LIVING and enjoying every moment of it, was the best time I've spent getting to know someone in a very, very long time. Thank you, Bill Cunningham, for what you do and for touching us...inspiring us...with your honest, simple approach and way of life. Most of the time with the news in the headlines, I must admit that I'm embarrassed to be part of the human race...you make me proud to be part of it. Amazing eye, amazing man...great documentary!"
4,Good vacuum but requires cleanings...,"This vacuum is great...Looks awesome, comes with good attachments, and is bagless. Has great suction/cleaning ability (look below)I love the scented exhaust filters.A problem - in order to keep suction STRONG (both as a vacuum and using attachments), you must empty the canister AND knock the dust and dirt out of the foam filter and the HEPA filter. Otherwise, the suction is not good. I've done a full washing of my hepa filter/canister/foam filter maybe 3 times in the 3+ years we've had this vacuum...so a full cleaning is pretty much optional. But if you don't beat the dust out of the various filter parts every few cleanings, this vacuum is almost useless.I should note that I have three children, two cats, and a dog. We live in a place that is in desperate need of a duct cleaning. This vacuum works hard, and has for the past 3 years."
2,cheaper for a reason,"I also bought this as a cheaper version of the Dyson. The suction for the main vacuum is ok, unless I'm using it on a hard floor, but the hose and attachments are horrible. They do nothing. The hose will not pick up anything much less the attachments. So, yes, it's cheaper than a Dyson but it's not worth what you pay for it."
5,Made a Good Gift,"Gave it as a bday gift to a guitar player and he appriciated it, I have seen him use it."
4,Jess Franco at his best (which isn't saying much),"Jess Franco, Spanish cinema's enfant terrible, has made some laughably bad films over the years, but Succubus (Necronomicon) is probably better than most. It's a delirious romp through an exotic night club performer's dementia. Although there's no actual sex in the film, it is fairly kinky and features an acid-fueled ""love in"", with a midget and a cross dresser. The film is by turns mesmerizing and ridiculous. It's a good party movie."
2,Weird but washed out,"Be warned that the colors in this dvd are exceptionally bright and washed out. The movie itself is great, in an Ed Wood mimics softcore Godard ala Bava sort of way. But if you're expecting a quality dvd image, think again. The transfer is acceptable, but the print is as faded as a hippy's blue jeans."
1,Mega crap !,"This movie is very pathetic! It is confusing, boring and..... boring. It isn't scary at all, in fact this can't be called a""horror movie"", it would be a terrible mistake!!!!!During the movie i fell asleep for a few times and my father waked me up!You can buy any other movie instead of it and you will be satisfied with your choice!"
2,Charger fell apart,"Trying to make my husband's old phone last, I ordered two of these chargers. Before 3 months passed, both fell apart. Each time, the charger case broke when pulled from the wall outlet. Ironically, I'll probably reorder as my husband doesn't want to have to learn to use a new phone. Old dog, etc."
2,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"BEFORE YOU READ THIS....THIS IS NOT A REVIEW FOR FANS WHO SUPPORT B!MACHINE. THIS IS A REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NAIVE TO B! MACHINE AND ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS ALBUM. I want to give a better rating to this boaring album...but I simply can't do that. This album is overrated. The first track 'angels' is kinda cool...and there are a few other tracks that are just ok. However, most of this record is plain boaring and pathetic. The album's cover art is cool...but in the end....this is some blase synth pop music that lacks a pulse....and not a cool Undead Pulse..rather, this is mostly just a dead end to B! Machine. Did I mention that it is boaring? Let me say this again...BOARING. One more time so that it's perfectly clear....BOARING! PATHETIC! BOARING!!! Ok, that was two more times...here's one more...BOARING!...-""This must be art, because it shure as hell is not entertainment.""---Pogo."
5,Great DVD,It includes one or two videos that my son does not have. He loves WordWorld! I wish they would introduce new videos.
5,Very Educational For Children,this dvd is very educational for children to watch! i think that its great for a child to be able to watch t.v. and learn how to spell words at the same time!
4,Educational & Fun,"I prefer classic Sesame Street, Reading Rainbow - but Word World is quite good. Educational and fun for the kids."
4,Tosh The Untold Story,"Arise Blackman is a wonderful compilation of instrumentals, original Wailing at its finest. With a few Maga Dog version riddims blessed by a couple of chanters, many of these tunes showcase a producer driven Tosh with various moods and styles. Its a great album to have if you've never heard Tosh's early creative works that show his influence as an artist and as a Wailer."
4,"Great value, handle with care","This is an exciting little package for someone looking for a great style beginner's guitar. I have played around with it for awhile and enjoyed the results, particularly for the price. I want to do slide guitar so I bought some blues strings. Here is where the care comes from. One string snapped as I went to loosen it and came pretty close to my eye. Not really anybody's fault, but be careful when doing this. All in all, great deal and I would recommend. I can't give it 5 stars b/c I don't want to give the illusion to anyone that this is an amazing guitar, but I would recommend to beginners."
4,Works great,"Very easy to use and install: just install and go! Pop-Up Stopper positions itself right in your Internet Explorer toolbar for easy access should you need to tweak things or more importantly, figure out how many pop-ups it killed."
2,"The music may be tight, but the understanding is key!!","James Hall's music is very avante garde and I like his approach; however, the choir lacks enunciation skills. I believe the consumer should not have to read the insert to get clarity and understanding of the words. James is good, but I think he should listen to Richard Smallwood and Thomas Whitfield when it comes to clarity. The two mentioned really are detailed oriented when it comes to music and clarity of words. I truly believe if James Hall would focus on pronouncing, the choir would be much more effective."
5,Conscious Capitalism is a must for the new century.,"In 'Conscious Capitalism' David Schwerin goes beyond what we normally consider business ethics. He gives his readers a deep spiritual foundation for values in business, something that we've rarely seen in the twentieth century but that will surely be crucial for the twenty-first century.Author David Schwerin is that rare combination of successful businessman and esoteric scholar. And this combination makes for a fascinating book, both instructive and insightful, and with compelling examples and stories.If any reader wants to know what spiritual and ethical business will look like in the future, this is the book to read. We can't recommend it highly enough!"
1,I wish I could justify investing in this book...,"I wish I could read this book, but unfortunately, I won't pay the hefty sum for it. I might pay $50 for a hardcover or platinum special edition, but I will not pay $50 for a 224 page paperback where the last 10% of the book is dedicated to an index."
4,Works Fine...Hard to Install,"I work on construction projects along the roadway, so I really like having strobes to alert passing cars. This product works great, but installing it took several days. I wanted to hide all the wiring, so it just took along time to route the cables, remove trim, hide the wires, and cover them back up. The best place I could find to mount the power supply was beneath the back seat, so I had to find routes from outside my truck cab to side the cab for the cables. Also, the wiring instructions left a lot to the imagination, but I finally figured it all out. The bulbs are very fragile, so be careful not to put them in a bind while installing, or they will break...and replacements are not cheap."
4,Perfect for those big glasses,"I just bought a pair of large prescription sunglasses and was surprised the office didn't have a case large enough to hold them. After shopping around I came across these. Not crazy about black, but the other cases that claim to be big don't actually give the dimensions so I went with this one. Size is perfect, and I like hard cases vs. soft for prescription glasses of any type. I just wish it came in a different color. Nice case, though, lightweight and sturdy."
2,Wrong Fit for Cocoons,"The case is exactly as shown. Purchased it for my Cocoons sunglasses which fit over my prescription glasses. The case depth was more than adequate, but the 6.5"" inches length didn't work, about 1/2"" too short. The case is shaped in a curve, so you lose length. Very disappointed. It now houses a regular pair of glasses. Also, it's way too big to fit in a purse or glove box. Discovered that Cocoons brand sells their own cases, about the same price and much more user-friendly."
2,Too small,"I bought these hoping that they would fit my Fox ""The Study"" glasses. They don't. The box itself is basic enough and looked like it would have worked just fine if it had been large enough."
4,"As advertised, works well.","It was as advertised, and was only about six dollars. It really is oversize, but it looks fine and does the job of protecting the glasses. Have not had any issue with wear and tear yet. Overall, it was as expected and a decent value."
3,"Great Size, Not as Described",The case is large enough to fit my oversized sunglasses which is great but it was described as just a plain black case. It has really cheesy designer knock off symbols on the case.
3,mediocre,"Case is durable and fits large glasses. However, the inside plastic liner began to detach soon after purchase. I simply reglued it and its okay now."
5,A Masterpiece,"Please see my complete review of this DVD in my Amazon review of Fazil Say's CD, Black Earth."
2,Frustrating,"As a fairly new transcriptionist working on a mainly surgical account, I need all the help I can get from my references, and I have found this book to be extremely frustrating. In the month that I have owned it, I have found TWO (yes, TWO) terms that I was looking for. The rest I have found by using other resources. Save your money."
