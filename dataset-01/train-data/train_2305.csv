2,Would have been a better book,"I bought this sight unseen because I'm a big Ricky Gervais fan from ""The Office,"" but also his stand-up specials which are available on DVD. ""The Invention of Lying"" feels like it would have been incredibly funny on paper, but it's just not a good movie. I don't know if the director was off his game or what, but it felt like the ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" movie where you know each scene was better in the book than the movie. I wonder if ""Lying"" would've been a better book than movie. Maybe like ""Good Omens"" which I hope is never a movie."
2,"""What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is to revive the old art of Lying.""-Oscar Wilde","You would think the topic is thought provoking; in a world where nobody ever lied, a man is ""liberated"" and finally discovers lying. Not true; the jokes are lame and predictable, and Ricky Gervais is decidedly not funny.In a world that is disgustingly stuffed with lies, it is more refreshing to imagine the effects of not lying. That's why I think that "" Liar, Liar"" is a smart and hilarious movie. ""The invention of lying"" is a seriously flawed imitation of ""Liar Liar"". A great chasm exists between Ricky Gervais' performance and the amazingly funny and smart performance of Jim Carrey in Liar,,Liar."
4,The social commentary really begins after the movie ends.,"This is a cute little movie. It is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is a sweet romantic comedy: A man discovers a way to control everyone else in the world, but he chooses to _not_ control the woman he loves, allowing her to decide for herself whether she wants to be with him.The fact that the movie involves religious ideas has sent a lot of people into a tizzy. But the real commentary on religion and beliefs can be found by reading between the lines of the one-star reviews here.A nice film about relationships, followed by some sociological lessons here. Good value for your money."
1,Poor quality,"I just recently bought two of these swords, both already had small cracks in the blade when I recieved them. The swords barely lasted 10 minutes of light sparring before blades split completely."
1,Useless!,"I upgraded from an earlier version and absolutely hate this version. The background of the program is silly looking and doesn't look like a Windows program at all. It looks like some kid drew it. The card choices are few (and none at all in some cases, like for Birthday, Friend!) and the Internet option for downloading cards is a waste of time. Not user-friendly at all."
1,Very disappointing upgrade!,"If you already have an earlier version, keep it! This was a waste of my time. You spend a lot of time trying to download from their website and cards that I had with the earlier version were no longer available. I returned my copy fast. The Platinum version is just as bad. Believe me, I tried both versions and am sticking with my old ones. They need to come up with something better in the future or they will loose me as a customer."
2,Disappointing,I've used CreataCard for many years to make about 100 greeting cards a year. This is a most disappointing upgrade. I spend most of my time waiting on the internet to view graphics. There are a lot of graphics available online but what a waste of my time. Unless there is a change in this format in the future this will be the last purchase of CreataCard for me.
5,Creatacard Gold Can't Be Beat,"This program is super easy to use. You can make greeting cards, address labels, postcards, stationery, business cards, etc. It is a very user-friendly program. You don't need to have any advanced knowledge to use this software. You just load it & use it. I have used several different greeting card programs & this is by far, the easiest & the best."
4,create a card,I have enjoyed using this and find that is exceedingly easy to use as I am a computor dummy. I feel if I can use it anybody can.
3,Greeting card maker,It was what I was looking for but it didn't have as many choices on it that I hoped for. Had a platinum one and was so much better. Was on computer that went down on me.
1,"Sucks, Sucks, Sucks",Software doesn't run. Website doesn't work. Technical Support might help if you call during bankers hours. Absolute waste of money.
2,THIS SUCKS!,"This game doesn't even work! It has a pretty interesting beginning for the intro but after the short movie beginning thing, the part with sme telephone thing pops up and you can't do anything with it. If you're gonna buy this, buy the jewel case one because that one had alot of great reviews and I think we bought the wrong one. I work SO hard for $10.00 so that I could buy this and all it was was a rip-off. My teacher has the newer version of this game (which we thought we were buying) and it is SO fun! That's actually how I found out how bad I wanted the game. I was working around the house alot so that I could earn $3.00 because the game was 10 bucks and I already had 7. Then I finally got it and we ordered it about two days ago and it already got here. I was so excited and I just tried to play it and it sucks... please. If you're gonna buy this game, you might want to check what year first and see which is the newer one."
4,Good read,"This book provides good insights on how to positively influence your organization regardless of your job title or position. It gives practical advice on how to manage peers, subordinates and the higher-ups. The online assessment wasn't really worth the time to take it as it didn't provide any real insight other than rehashing the data you entered. That aside..I still think it's a good resource.I'd recommend this book for anyone in business especially those in middle-management."
3,Kind of hit and miss,"You can find my review on Youtube: [...]This wasn't my favorite book. There were some really good principles, but much of the book felt like something I had already read in other leadership books."
2,360 Degree Leader,We enjoy Maxwell's look at leadership. This book hits on the subject of what if you are not the Boss can you still influence people. We thought it was so good we gave it as a gift to a friend to encourage him.
2,OUTSTANDING,"I have sent this fantastic book to many friends. If you are not already doing much of the principle's in this book, you should start. If you are, this book is of great encouragement and a great resource for quotes. It makes you look inside yourself and evaluate your currrent influence in others lives.Don't pass this one up !!!"
1,no product,I ordered this on May 15th 2009. It is now June 28th and I STILL DO NOT HAVE IT! WHAT GIVES?
5,A repeat read ...,"I have read this book twice now and it never gets old. I would suggest that you read it before you start a new job or right after a promotion.I has lots of common sense in it, but serves as a good reminder of the fact that good management and leadership is about people, and not much else.If you have early or mid-career managers that work for you, it is a good suggested read for them as well.I've found that it you walk away with a list of 2 to 3 key items from each chapter and compile a consolidated list (which the author helps with) you can certainly compile a good collection of Dos and Don'ts that can serve as a navigator for your corporate character.Regards,-R"
3,NOT MUCH NEW,"THIS WAS A BOOK I WAS ANTICIPATING FOR A LONG TIME NOW. UPON ITS RELEASE, I WAS ACTUALLY EXPECTING TO READ ALOT OF WHAT JOHN HAS DISCOVERED IN HIS LEADERSHIP JOURNEY SINCE HIS LAST WRITING. HOWEVER, AS A FOLLOWER OF JOHN MAXWELL FOR MANY YEARS, AND AN OWNER OF PRACTICALLY EVERY BOOK,TAPE OR VIDEO HE HAS EVER RELEASED, (INCLUDING HIS DAYS AS A PASTOR), I FOUND VERY LITTLE NEW MATERIAL.DONT GET ME WRONG,HIS MATERIAL IS EXCELLENT...BUT MY POINT IS THAT ITS SIMPLY BEEN RE-ARRANGED AND BROUGHT OUT IN A DIFFERRENT WAY.IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A COMPILATION OF PREVIOUS WORKS THAN AN ACTUAL NEW BOOK.HOWEVER,IF YOU ARE A NEW READER,OR MORE RECENT READER OF HIS MATERIAL,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IN THAT IT GATHERS MUCH OF HIS BEST IN ONE VOLUME."
4,Developing middle-managers,This is a very good book to develop middle managers in an organization. John Maxwell points out how those in the middle can have a great leadership influence and shouldn't wait until they make it to the top to sharpen their skills. The book is easy to read and full of insightful quotes and stories.
5,Practical Leadership Development,"Philosophically and practically a working guide to the development of solid and growing leadership skills... at all levels of the organization. Not a new book, but a universally valuable one to all companies striving to develop loyalty and leadership skills throughout the organization."
1,The 360 Degree Leader Facilitator Guide,"The format same as the test book of primary school.The content is superficial, not worth a farthing.The book makes me disappoint."
3,Author is full of himself,The author has a lot of great information - but the entire book feels like a commercial for his other books and speeches/lectures.
2,Gets repetitive after a few chapters,"I like John Maxwell. His leadership skills are widely recognized not just within Christian circles but beyond it. His books read effortlessly: it's like listening to one of his motivational talks. It's hard not to be energized by it.But I think I prefer Maxwell's quotable quotes rather than entire books. The 360 Degree Leader is just one example why.The first few chapters sound great; the principles aren't mind-numbingly awesome, but you can't really disagree with them either. But after a while, it starts to sound repetitive and even a bit clich√©. I couldn't finish it; it just felt like the book didn't have anything more to offer."
5,Leaders in Us All,"Things about being a leader have always interested me - but my new job really forces me to understand leadership on a whole new level. John Maxwell is the go-to on leadership - and his latest book, The 360 Degree Leader was another thought-provoking, challenging read. This book is not just for those in leadership positions - it is for anyone in a company - at any level and show you how your role can be leadership - no matter where you are. It encourages you in how to support your leader and by doing so, increase your own leadership level. I was deeply challenged with this book - there is room for leadership on many levels and that is what makes our companies strong - I am planning to share this one around - everyone will see a place for themselves and those are the kinds of work places we want to build!"
4,"Organized explanation of leading from the top, middle and bottom","Frequent author John C. Maxwell applies his career counseling formula to another aspect of leadership: how people in the middle of large organizations can add to their company's leadership equation. His popular books rely on long lists of myths, challenges, principles, rules or values. Each one is identified, numbered (Maxwell is a firm believer in the power of numerical orderliness) and accompanied by an example or uplifting story - often making it unclear whether the book is inspirational, instructional or both. In practice, will people refer to these lists, or simply draw from Maxwell's major concepts? Although leadership defies a static definition, we believe this book may come in handy for enlightened senior and middle managers, as well as for those who are involved in developing up-and-coming managers."
1,"Over Simplistic, Story Telling, Lacking Substance","Having read most of John Maxwell's books and observed his church ministry for over 25 years, I found this book, like all of his books, to be over-simplistic, watered-down and lacking substance. His (or his ghostwriter, Charlie Wetzel's) approach to writing has taken a topic, as critical as leadership, and made it trivial.This book rehashes and regurgitates the same old ideas in most of Maxwell's books. If you like lots of trite, feel-good stories, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for real, pragmatic, substantive ideas on leadership...don't waste your money!"
1,Review audio book,This audio book does not follow the hard Copy book. Audio jumps from section to section and does not read the whole book word for word. Do not purchase the audio book.
5,Amazon,I received my order very quickly and it was in very good condition as per advertised. I love ordering from Amazon where I have a lot of choices and have never been disappointed.
2,not what i was looking for,"personally, i was looking for a learnign how to drum video. I thought that this was it but , i thought wrong. This is simply teaching you how to play drums with another percussionist. Maybe if that is what you are looking for it would suit you better."
2,An uneven set of tracks,"Track one is so fine, in there with the best of quintet jazz in a traditional sound. Past track one I began to ask. ""why this after track one?"" The sound bits onAmazon convinced me to buy this CD. I was not intentionally misled, I just did notlisten to those with a keen ear. There are good passages on any track, it is always a treat to listen to Hank Jones."
3,Gets Pilly Once You Wash It,"If that doesn't concern you, then it's a decent product. I washed it per the directions, and it pilled-up quite a bit. Since I use it under the sheet, it's not a huge issue, but if I'd known this beforehand, I'd have purchased another pad."
1,Baby sweats against unbreathable material,"I bought this pad because my baby would sweat against the waterproof material of his mattress. Based on the other reviews I read about this product, I thought that it would put some space in between him and his mattress and stop his sweating. Unfortunately, this pad is very thin as far as mattress pads go, and it is also unbreathable. My baby sweat even worse against this then when he slept on nothing but a sheet over his mattress. I recommend going with something that is not waterproof. All baby mattresses are waterproof anyway so you do not need something waterproof in a mattress pad."
4,Not bad for the price,"They don't hold up great in the wash, but it is no big deal since they are used under the sheet anyway. They serve the purpose, but just get ""pilly"" after a couple washings."
3,It seems to serve it's purpose,"I am not extremely excited about this purchase, but it does all right. The teddy bear design which is quilted into the pad shows through all of our sheets (cream and off white flannel), which I'm not crazy about, but the baby doesn't seem to care either way.This pad is not the highest quality, but It seems to absorb spit up leaky diapers."
2,Nice price but elastic came apart after one washing,"I bought 2 of these matress pads, and washed them according to the label. The elastic came apart on one of the pads after the first washing. In hindsight, I would have paid the extra money for the more expensive pads.The shipping aspect was great- arrived on time and was free!"
4,Washes Well on Gentle Cycle,"I saw some people didn't think this washed well but it did fine when I washed it, if you follow the directions."
1,Overpriced and poor quality.,"I've washed this pad three times now, following all of the recommended instructions. It's already pilled and fraying at the edges of the skirt. I have a flat pad from this same line which has been laundered the same number of times. It looks as if I've had it a year -- and used it hard for a year, at that, which I haven't.Not only that, but WalMart sells this exact same item for four dollars less. Talk about a gyp! If I'm going to buy something cheap and poorly wearing (which wasn't my intent), I could have at least saved myself the shipping and four dollars."
2,Not impressed,"I just bought this last night and after washing it and putting it on the mattress, I am not impressed! It doesn't fit snug and actually bunches up in the middle! I would prefer something that wraps all the way around with no bunching or wrinkles in the middle. Any suggestions?"
3,Alittle too big,This mattress pad is soft and appears to be durable. My only complaint is that it is too big for the mattress and bunches up alittle. The directions say that it will shrink in the dryer which I thought might fix the problem but it did not.
2,"Pills! Oh no, bad quilted pad..shame on you.",It pilled up with the wash and dry{tumble low}! AND it shrunk just the tinest bit so to annoy you because it fits but not quite and you broke your nail trying to get it to touch the bottom of the mattress! Grrrrrr.....
2,Don't be fooled,My son's mattress is quite firm. I wanted to add some cushion for his comfort. This pad is not for that at all. I ended up cutting a twin eggcrate pad to add softness to his bed. This pad may be fine for all other reasons but I didn't even try it.
5,New Mom,This mattress pad has held up extremely well for me. My baby is 9 months old and it still looks new.
5,beats the rest,"I purchased one 18 months ago when my son was born and another one just a month ago for my newborn daughter. They don't crinkle when they sleep, have super deep pockets, very absorbent, wash easily, and inexpensive. What more could you ask for. Highly recommend."
1,Name doesn't fit item,"With ""pad"" included in the name, I expected a cushiony feel for my daughter's mattress. Instead this was more of a mattress cover. This quilted item is super thin and to have pad as apart of the name is false advertisement. So if you need a cushion feel so your little one can sleep comfortable at night do not order this."
5,Never wears out !,"I bought 2 of the these in case I have to wash one. I do wash then almost every 2weeks for over one year and they still look good. Love it, would recommend!"
1,Waste of Money!,This pad is so thin that it doesn't make any difference in comfort. We wasted almost $20 (after taxes and shipping) for a pad that is paper thin. You're better off buying a twin mattress pad at a store and cutting it to size! It is half the expense of this pad and way more comfortable.
5,Love it!,"I love this product. The color is great - I have a boy, so it works in his Suzy's Zoo themed room."
2,Not worth the price,"The cd was not worth the price for the information it provided, and the maps were ILLEGIBLE. If you want something informative on clan history, try ""Highlanders : A History of the Scottish Clans"" by Fitzroy MacLean. It gives almost exactly the same information plus a lot more history and vignettes on specific clan figures."
5,Great for students,I purchased this for my Behavior Modification class. It has been an excellent source for defining terms. I take it to class everyday. It will also serve me in the future as I prepare for the Psych GRE. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
3,Ok resource,"While having one place to look for definitions is a great idea, I found this resource lacking in some key definitions, and had to go back to Cooper....Stimulus generalization, response generalization were lacking, as were some other key terms."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this because of the unlimited undo capability on Spider. But the game has no hint feature and includes animation which cannot be turned off. Curiously, when your game is over, you cannot just redeal a new one, you must stop and enter a name (every time) to record the score, then watch a dealer deal you a new game. Not fun to play. Found a free good one online...no, not the AARP one which is just as bad. Only great one is the one that comes with a new Windows computer. Don't waste money on any solitaire download or CD."
2,Soliterror,I really do not like this game. The game ends and you don't know if you've won or if you have just used up all the plays. It was not very expensive but it's not even worth it if it was free and you only have to play shipping and handling. I would not purchase it. Poor version of solitaire.
2,does less than half the job,"If you want something that covers the cell phone OK when you dont want to flip it, then this is the perfect item for you. But if you want to open the flip and do something, then forget it. The csse is not well designed and it blocks the camera when you flip open the 3125. It looks very clumsy with a gap that dangles at the back when the phone is open. Moreover the case does not cover the keypad completely. Like with all other annoying phone cases, it has that big button at the back and so if you have the case, you can only use it with the clip. Overall this is a cheap case that only protects your phone when it is closed."
4,Faina reveiw,"I thought this Alias book was good. Some parts of it were fantastic and some were just good. I liked how Sydney was trying to relate to Faina while the other operatives were just looking at her and seeing there mission. I am also glad that Sydney acted under an alias, the books seem more dull if she isn't pretending to be someone she is not. Over all I liked this book."
3,"Should be titled ""Opportunity Is When It Knocks""","The author certainly lives up to his last name. This is a turgid tale of plain and simple usury, very likely written so the author could continue to sponge off his theatrical agent's name and reputation, even after her death. Opportunist supreme, this Callow Fellow. I don't dispute Callow's talent as a writer, but he's obviously so consumed with his own rise to glory, he can't even see that he played a major role in his gay lover's suicide. And what a bloody disservice he's done poor Margaret Ramsay after all she did for him. Callow has never fulfilled her wishes to scatter her ashes in Venice. Says he's not sure why he's never gotten round to it. I'm convinced it's because he cares about no one but himself. Personally, I would never buy this book, because I would feel as if I, too, was helping to pay Callow's way. Buyer with a conscience, beware."
1,"I aggree with ""Opportunity is where it knocks""","I was nauseous from reading this book. I ditto the comments of ""opportunity is where it knocks."" This book was so obscene in that Callow used so many people to get ahead. Waited util they died to capitalize on them. Callow is a creep."
4,"As always, Charlaine Harris knocked this book out of the park!","I love all of the Sookie Stackhouse books, every one of them has a great story and lots of excitement! Definitely worth the buy!"
4,"You go, Sookie!","I've enjoyed Charlaine Harris' series - all of them. I looked forward to this installment in the Southern Vampire series, and was not disappointed.However, don't underestimate Charlaine. Her books have a cozy appearance, but don't let it fool you! You welcome back many of the previous players, and get introduced to many more new ones.Eric has a new side to show, and so does Bill. Alcide, a new character, will hopefully be seen in more of the stories.Bill disappears, and Eric goes to Sookie for help. Sookie, accompanied by Alcide, goes 'undercover' to find Bill in unfamiliar territory. Needless to say, danger and mayhem ensue, with bodies (dead and REALLY dead) dropping (or rising)everywhere.Kudos, Charlaine!"
2,Not up to scratch,"If anyone has read my earlier reviews of the first and second installments of this Southern vampire mystery series, you must know how much I enjoyed the books. They were great, fast paced, thrilling reads, but Club Dead is, in truth, disappointing.Ms. Harris did not live up to the reputation of this series. Club Dead resembled that of an overly dramatic cheesy soap opera. Sookie's love life is in shambles, Bill leaves her for another vampire for an unexplained reason, more men want to get into her pants and her life is in even more danger. Charlaine Harris attempted to fit so much into one book without any clear cohesion that the whole book was an absolute mess.Just to add to the disappointments, Club Dead is a slow read. The action does not start until late into the book and I found myself sluggishly reading from page to page as if it was a tiresome chore."
5,"Shephard of Judea, this is a good read!","This series has grown on me, book after book, and hats off to Ms. Harris for really shaking things up in the Bill/Sookie romance. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books, but wondered how many more times the author would re-tread the relationship, when BANG! she has Bill do the unthinkable! I do like Bill, but bravo to Ms. Harris for creating such other delectable alternatives for Sookie, namely Eric and Alcine the werewolf. Yum!The plot was zippy and twisty, though Sookie got pummeled into the dirt one time too many. Not a big fan of the resolution, but boy did I have fun getting there. Running to the store now to get Dead to the World...can't wait!"
4,Well....,"I was disappointed that Bill took a turn for the worse in this book..I am an average housewife that likes vampires and a good romance/mystery novel, which the other two books were, but I was really let down by this novel and the decisions made with Bill's character...I hope that Ms. Harris brings Bill back to be the more devoted, loving, and protecting companion of Sookie's that he was in the first two novels...instead of making him the ""bad"" guy that he was portrayed as in this one...I am still looking forward to the next book..and still highly recommend reading this one as well..."
3,"I liked it, it was very entertaining","I actually liked this book, it was very entertaining. It's about Bill disappearing and kidnapped. This book also introduces new characters and, possibly romantic relationship with Sookie, Werewolf, Alside, and introduces vampire Lorena. What I didn't like about this book, was that it leaves questions in the open."
3,Addicting!,The third Southern vampire mystery I've finished in 3 weeks. I think it's safe to say I'm addicted. These books would be great beach reads...if I had a beach to read them on.
3,Another like the rest,"This book was was the next book in the series, and i felt it was good enough to read through without stopping but not jaw dropping good."
4,Best one in the series yet.,"So Club Dead isn't really a mystery, it is more action, and that was a welcome rest from the previous two's whodunit feel to them. There was a little bit of a mystery to this one, but not as much. I really enjoyed this book, I read it in two sittings (I took a break to eat.) I am starting to recommend this series to people at my work (I work in a bookstore) and I don't see an end to my love affair with Charlaine Harris in sight. I see her gradually working her way into my top ten favorite authors rather quickly."
3,Perfect for Those Bored at Work,"Another page-turning addition to the series. All the enticing plot elements are present, supernatural beings, love and lust. These all get piled together into a mystery that isn't that important. I keep coming back to these books for the Sookie story, that girl is hilarious and she keeps getting into trouble. This is not a book to read for the mystery, but for the romance. Of course the supernatural adds a nice twist.There are not many fresh elements here, as this is the third book in the series. Several times the writer rehashes old character information, that consecutive readers will be familiar with. Sookie's moral qualms about which vampire to sleep with keep coming up, but there is not likely to be a resolution as that would make the series much less interesting. Overall a fast, enjoyable escape to the South, perfect for anyone a little bored at work."
5,Hooked on this series...,"OK - I'm officially hooked on the Sookie Stackhouse series. ""Club Dead"" did not disappoint. I know some readers were disappointed with Bill, but you have to admit it's pretty funny that even a dead guy will cheat - come on, you're alive for eternity but can't stay faithful for a lousy couple of months!!!! Snappy dialogue, great characters, total escape. I'd be reading book 4 right now but this series has become so popular with HBO's Trueblood that the book stores in my neck of the woods have sold out! I'll be stalking my mailman until it hits my mailbox."
3,"good, but something's missing.....","in this third installment of The Sookie Vampire mysteries, Sookie's vampire boyfriend, Bill, has come up missing and Sookie and new ""hunky werewolf"" character Alcide go to Mississippi to try to find him. While there's a lot to love in book 3- revisiting old characters like Bubba/Elvis, or Sookie's interaction with Alcide and Erik, this book seemed to flounder a bit. I think my main problems with the book were the absence of Bill and the pretty much absence of any mystery storyline. In fact, I felt the whole ""Mississippi"" storyline was very underdone and not even resolved by book's end.But in the end, as a Southerner, I cannot deny the overall charm and whimsy of the series. Which means that while I will try the rest of the series, I hope they get better than this one.3 stars."
4,Best Book in Series so Far!,This book was very good. I would highly recommend it! Now on to Book 4 in the series.
5,Club Awesome!,"Of course I'm one who doesn't like an unhappy ending, and I couldn't stand Bill's unfaithfulness to Sookie. I thought there love was for real in the first two books, and wanted it to last through the tough test. But, hey, there are still many more books in the series. The third installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series delivers just as much as the first two; its entertaining, romantic ( a little less in this one though), and funny. A whole delightful package these books are and I will recommend this to everyone I know."
3,This is the one that sucked me in...,"Review: The third book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, and I'm still into it. This book feeds into every woman's fantasy -- all the men that you meet will undoubtedly fall in love with you, think you're the most beautiful woman on the planet, and find you irresistibly sexy. This, unfortunately, isn't Sookie's biggest problem in Club Dead. Her men -- how many there are, you'll have to read the book to find out -- are the best of her troubles. The worst? She almost dies a few times, her vampire boyfriend is kidnapped, and possibly might not even be her boyfriend any longer, and she makes her first official kill herself. Cool. Exciting stuff. I'll be reading #4 before the week is out, I'm sure. Welcome to Alison's newest guilty pleasure.[...]"
4,Page Turner,"Harris' 3rd book in the Southern Vampire series zings along with no time out for resting. This book was highly enjoyable and left me wanting more, which I guess is Harris' goal. The only quibble I have with the book is how easily the big rescue scene came off.I'll be back to read the rest of the series!"
2,"Not bad, but not as good as the first 2","After reading the first 2 Southern Vampires books, I was excited to see a 3rd one out so soon. I was very disappointed. At the end of book 2, Sookie and Bill were fine romance wise, but all of a sudden in this book they are having problems with no development of any previous tension. All of a sudden he leaves town and it was like the author decided, they need to break up so let's see what I can come up with. The scenes with Sookie and Eric are great, but the parts with Bill are boring and the scene in the trunk of the car is just awful. Not to ruin things for anyone, read no further if you don't want a spoiler, but Bill rapes Sookie and she crawls back to him. It was a slap in the face to all women! Then we find out what the big mystery was that Bill had to keep secret. All that for a stupid computer program. This was not a well developed book, and the author just destroyed the heroine's credibility as a sane woman in one paragraph. Poorly done."
4,Fun Series,"Just finished the 3rd book in this series. Read them all over the last month. So, here's my recommendation. Read them all in order. It does help, though not required. Find, a nice quick weekend and enjoy.There are a whole lot worse ways of spending your time."
3,Mislead,"The book itself arrived very quickly and in great condition. However, the book was listed under hardback and when it arrived it was paperback. Very disappointing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"What's one of these paranomal romance books without a vampire nightclub with its own peculiar rules of etiquette?Not to mention slim-hipped pillow pretty boy proprietors or staff that fancy a well buildt young small town for playtime and plaything.Luckily for her, her main sucker squeeze can hold his own.3 out of 5"
3,Not bad,"First I would like to say that the books in this series are fluff reading. Fun to read and then forget about. They don't have any depth at all. Nothing to ponder. No insight to the human condition. If you are looking for the Dune of vampires, this is not it.That being said, I am disapointed that Sookie gets all slutty in this novel. If that trend continues, I will stop reading."
2,hmm,"This is the third book in the series... By now you would think that Sookie would have learned her lesson but no. She allows herself to be pulled into situations where she just gets brutalized. It's probably a good thing that Bill has become her ex.. but the way things are going with Eric.. I really just want to smack some sense into that girl.Also, this book plays on sooo many southern stereotypes. I mean really. It's gotten to the point where it's not even all that funny anymore."
2,A Car Crash of a Book,"You know how you sometimes go to those action movies (""guy flicks"") and from the moment you sit back in your seat until the closing credits 90 minutes later, you are assaulted by car chase after car chase, explosion after explosion, and you have no idea where to look first or what's really going on? That is how I felt reading ""Club Dead.""I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but I seriously had no clue where the plot line was -- or if there even was one. Yes, there was a ton of action, but it was enough for three or four books instead of just one. And the motivations about what was going on was never really explained.A lot happened in this book, but I'm not really sure what it was -- or why it occurred. Too bad, as I really enjoy the characters, and Harris has a great way with words."
2,Left Me Cold,"I read books one and two of this series and really liked them. This third one left me cold. It was slow, garbled, inconsistent with previous books and completely out of character for Sookie and Bill. I was so disappointed with the ending that I thought I would just try another series by a different author. This book makes almost no sense on its own, so if you don't continue reading the next in the series you will have not idea if what happened in this book means the end for Sookie and Bill. Unlikely, I suppose since this is a Romance novel series, but I never heard of one that ends with such a cliffhanger. Completely unsatisfying novel."
3,"Fun, If Slightly Flawed Installment of The Series","Sookie Stackhouse continues to be so likeable, it excuses plot points that have been written to seem irrelevant. Bill, Sookie's vampire boyfriend, is called away on mysterious business. Yet it's only a matter of time before she discovers Bill has actually disappeared, and vampire Eric enlists her to go find him. Where the book was sloppy for me was the introduction of Bill's long lost vampire love who may be involved in the kidnapping. Her appearance is so brief, and what becomes of it is barely dealt with. There are also, at this point, so many men in Sookie's life, you have to wonder why she stays with Bill. But I guess, that's what makes her and the series interesting."
5,Great!,I love True Blood and although the books are a lot different from the show the books are still amazing. I would recommend it!
2,"Interesting story idea, very poor writing","I have now read the first three books in this series based on a friend's recommendation (luckily I was able to check them out of the library for free), and while I think the storylines themselves are rather creative and interesting, the author's conversational writing style is of too low quality. Blame it on all the good writers I've read over the years, but I could not stand to read any more of this person's writing."
2,"No more for me, thanks, I'm driving","Sookie's life is a mess. Her vampire boyfriend Bill is missing, his boss expects her to both rescue him and spy on him, various shapeshifters and vampires are after her hide, and her driveway needs re-graveling. She keeps running into supernatural beings who want to take her to bed, and all she wants is a nice quiet life.Our heroine gets knocked around, violently so, quite a bit in this third installment of Harris's Southern Vampire series, and I'm not entirely pleased with the direction the storyline seems to be taking. So this will probably be the last book of the series I read.It's enjoyable fluff, but I've finally convinced myself that my vampire phase is over."
2,Puh-Lease...,"So first off the only reason I'm even wasting my time with these books is because I am totally hooked on the HBO series and I don't want to wait years to find out what happens (even though the show is really nothing like the books)...SPOILER ALERT!!! The smartest thing Sookie has done thus far is when she ""rescinded"" (took back) the invitation into her house from Bill and Eric, which by the way I have never read a vampire book where that is even possible. I keep hoping one of these books will actually be a good read, but holy cow I'm having a hard time justifying the waste of time!"
2,Definitely not the best vampire story,"When you read the book's first chapter you'd think that you'll read a spooky book. So if you like eerie readings this could be it. The problem is that CH tried to make antic after jest and that only makes the book boring. If you really like to read a vampire love story, read ""Out of the Night"" by Robin T. Popp. That book has a really spooky love story."
2,Formulaic,"Inconsistent and formulaic (is Nora Roberts writing as Charlaine Harris now?). The book series started out pretty interestingly albeit with a few continuity errors. Already going downhill, but there is a market for the lowest common denominator-good for ""by the pool"". Take one look at the author and you'll see why she is living vicariously through a sexy, buxom young blonde. Hope the author isn't enjoying enough success that she fails to listen to her editors."
4,Entertaining series,"These books are amusing and entertaining. I'm probably older than the normal age of readers, but I still like them. I'll keep on reading until I get bored."
4,Finger Lickin' Good!,"This series is quickly becoming very addictive for me. Book 3 is full of trouble for poor Sookie, who finds out that Bill is cheating on her with a previous flame. Now, Sookie has to find Bill, who has been kidnapped. (Golly, don't you totally want to find him now??) I love how not only are there vampires in this book. Here, we are introduced to a sexy werewolf, in charge of keeping Sookie safe on her mission to find and save Bill. Werwolves, vamps, supes(that's the supernatural for ya), oh my! And all all them seem so very real to me, as though they might be lurking in my own town.As always, I love Sookie, who is an admirable human hero for keeping her head through all this madness. Also, we're introduced to Elvi---oh, dang, I mean, Bubba, who is bent on keeping our Sookie safe no matter what the cost.Looking forward to book 4!"
3,Nothing new,"While the location was different, the story was the same. I read most of the Sookie books just to have something to read... short and quick."
4,Sookie keeps getting better!,"This was my favorite so far of the ""Dead"" series. Sookie is growing up, and her life just keeps getting more complicated. She's learning some hard lessons, but she handles them with grace. I had a hard time putting this one down, especially during the action.I only gave it 4 stars because I reserve 5 for the books I am obsessed about, and this series hasn't quite reached that level. However, just because it might not win any awards, doesn't mean it isn't highly entertaining!"
2,Boy toy,"Grandson asked specifically for this toy and he LOVES it. I'm not so sure, but then again, I'm not 3."
1,Not a happy customer,"My 5 year old nephew asked for Optimus Prime for Christmas and I found it on Amazon. The ""new""Hasbro Transformers Cyber Stompin' Optimus Prime Action Figureproduct arrived in a timely manner but the item was dusty-not just a little, but a lot! We had to use a dry paint brush to get into all the little cracks. It also had little paint marks on it from another toy. I was VERY displeased and would have returned it for a full refund if I didn't have to ship it to my newphew so he would get it in time for Christmas.I will newver shop with Amazon again."
3,You will want to read this!,The toy was a total skam. They made it out to be the big Optimus Prime like they sell at Wal-Mart for 79.88. Instead it was the little one they sell at Wal-Mart for 29.99. We totally got screwed on this product. I would advise everyone not to purchase from them. We had this toy expedited so it would be here before Christmas and spent over $100 on this toy and it's not even worth it. It just makes a few sounds and that's it. These people are taking advantage of unsuspecting customers and screwing them over.
2,"VERY MISLEADING, AND UNEVENTFUL TOY","THE STOMPING action figure, only makes Stomping sounds when you press on 2 buttons on his feet. It is very misleading, but overall, the toy lacks any fun points. My 3 year old quickly moved on to the next toy, therefore we are returning it. It did not meet our expectations."
5,Optimus Prime,"I bought this Transformers Optimus Prime for my grandson who is 4 1/2 years old. He told me ""I have to have it, Grandma"". It is a great toy, and perfect for his age. While it does not transform - which may be a good thing for a preschooler - it does make noises, has movable arms and legs and has provided hours of fun."
5,Sound choice has the BEST Quality karaoke tracks in my opinion!!!,"This listing is for a brand new Sound Choice Star Series Contemp. Christian V.5 Karaoke CDG (SC2416R).This top of the line CD comes sealed in a heavy plastic jewel case, plays the music without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G; player. This is a Multiplex CD which has the 8 songs without vocals as well as the same 8 songs with guide vocals to help the singer learn the song before singing it in public. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but they are probably the BEST re-creations available.Sound Choice Star Series ChristianContemporary Christian Vol. 5 - 2416RStereo Performance/Vocal Tracks1.

1,Too bad quality,"good look but bad quality, it remain a stains on the skin. it look nice but its not worth it,"
2,for diehards only,very diappointed in this dvd. if you are a diehard collector then the clip from74 is probaly worth it to you. the lack of sound is not for me. very poorly put together and not worth the price.

1,I want my money back,"I'm a great fan of KISS, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. It is not an official DVD, very poor quality, and not even worth the disk it's on. For God's sake stayaway. It's too late for me.."
1,Why let thives getaway,I think it is sad that this type of films are released sinse they are only ripping of the band and just puting the money in theyr own pocket.I would have loved the 74 fotage on a offical kiss release but that I dont think is going to hapen now.People that are releasing this type of films are thives in my ophenion so stay away from this type of releases!!!!
1,Infomercial anyone,"I'm sorry but I haven't seen this DVD, but the two ""glowing"" reviews sound a lot like they should be on TV at 2am in-between real estate moguls wanting to make you rich and the latest ""sonic"" tooth brush, ear waxer, back scratcher! I'd be very surprised if they aren't plants by the distributor of this DVD....I may be wrong but as they both end with ""make sure you get vintage II as well"" maybe they can throw in College girls go wild at Alcatraz VIII and free shipping!!!"
3,"SUPER 8 mm film is silent, you teen age morons!","In a age of video people forget that back in the 70's video cameras weighed as much as a house and were B & W for the most part. Bootleg ""videos"" don't exist of these early KISS shows so all we have are these ""Home Movies"", taken by early fans.Remember the Zapruder camera which captured Kennedy's assination on film was an 8 mm. This is a record of history, without sound. This DVD is a record of KISSTORY, without music.So my sugestion is to just put on a record, woops sorry, CD, and play this DVD and imagine how it was in the 70's kid. When Rock & Roll was everthing. And home movies were silent. Like you should be!"
1,KISS VINTAGE REVIEW,"This DVD totally sucked! I can't believe it was released! All the footage is silent and the interviews are brief. It's a cheap bootleg version. (...) I love to see live footage of the band and the Second Coming DVD was great, but this was horrible. I can't believe KISS even knows that this is for sale. It's worth about 50 cents!"
3,It's alright,I bought this on DVD a while back and I watched once. I just got done watching this after a long time and I think it's actually pretty good. Sure there aren't any music performances but what do you expect from an UNAUTHORIZED movie. There are two clips of footage of early KISS with no sound though. Pretty good.
4,Good for boating,"The only real con about this is that it is kind of overpriced but I know that this brand is well known and pretty durable. We use it for boating and other water activities; it fits two iPhones, keys, and a wallet comfortably with a little room to spare. One of the bigger models might be better to fit EVERYONE's equipment while on the water but for now this works for the two of us. It is kind of difficult to open as well but it isn't really a big deal; just make sure to hold it while opening so your stuff doesn't fly out everywhere."
3,Not as expected.,"This hockey stick is nothing like it is pictured. Very basic, no grafixs and plain wood, not black as pictured."
1,Not pleased...,"I ordered this hockey stick to use for myself and it was much too short. Clearly, it is made for a youth goaltender. However, this is not the reason why I am unhappy...I am unhappy with this transaction because I sent the goalie stick back to eSportsonline for a refund and that refund never came. I followed the instructions included with the package - I called ahead and got an approved return with a reference number. I marked the package with the reference number and paid over $10 through UPS to have the item shipped back to eSportsonline. The company has NOT refunded my purchase.This poor review should reflect my experience with eSportsonline, not the hockey stick."
5,Great Book !,No other book gives a more effective treatment of the subject. A thorough explanation of the basics followed by a stepwise approach towards advanced topics. Thanks Kang and Leblebici for coming up with such a great book.
5,good book,This book introduces CMOS digital IC at a introductory graduate level; good reference for Electrical Engineers in the memory business.
1,"Seriously, people!","Okay, I am a mom trying to figure out if Ginger Plowman's books are for me. I am a Christian. We don't even currently spank our child. I've just heard, that spanking aside, Ginger Plowman deals with a child's heart instead of just forcing kids to do what we want them to do--and that sounds great to me.Seriously, how can I tell if I want to read the books or not when you guys keep cutting and pasting general reviews about how horrible it is to hit children. It is obvious that most of you haven't even read the different books she writes! PLEASE only write SPECIFIC reviews for a SPECIFIC book on this site so that people like me will know WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT (which, after all, is the purpose of a book review). Thank you.(one star only so it will get to the page with the appropriate reviews)"
1,Most dispicable piece of trash I have ever read!,"I am a father of two boys, never raised a hand to them, their mom and I always led by example. We taught by example, we allowed them to fail then taught them how to pick themselves up and LEARN from their failures. THAT is what God intended. This woman is, in my opinion, exactly the OPPOSITE of what God had intended. Read the new testament, folks, read what Jesus says about how no harm should ever come to His children. Shame on this woman. Judge her? Won't have to..come judgement day, God will have plenty to say, I'm sure. I would say, Ginger, the gates of hell await you! Hitting babies? Unbelievable. Toss this book or stay as far away from it as you can. Christians? Pray that you never read it! From a loving father, and one who supports showing children the way with love, not hitting."
1,NOT Christian virtues,Hurting a child is the LEAST Christian thing I can think of. And the parent that relies on corporal punishment to raise their children is both lazy and immoral.
1,This Book Gives SICK Advice!!,This book gives SICK advice! Hitting babies and children is sick whether they be hit by their parents or anyone else! Jesus says NO to violence and hitting little children is indeed violent and sick!
1,Not kind,"Be careful and be kind. This book, encourages striking babies and children to obtain compliance from them. This is not loving teaching. It is negative conditioning which is harmful to children because it is fear- based. Do not buy this book. It's teachings on child discipline are dangerous. A parent is to be a loving guide for children in the journey of growing up, not an intolerant, rigid punisher, dishing out pain. If you want children who grow up to be mentally and emotionally whole and healthy, find a book on positive parenting, not one that promotes hitting!"
1,Can't believe what some will say to make a dollar....,If you believe you should be submissive to your husband and you hit your children into submission then this is book for you. Does she think husbands should hit their wives into submission as well? I can't believe people go to should lengths to make a dollar.
3,Some Helpful Ideas,"I have to agree with several other reviews on Plowman's view on spankings, but that is not all that this book addresses. I have a Master's degree in Psychology and have worked with kids for 20 years. I also have 3 of my own and I know that any spanking done in anger is abuse. That is not what she is suggesting. Some kids respond well to timeout and some do not. Spanking can be used successfully for some children when done in love and not anger. I believe that firm, consistant punishment is the best way to teach a child. I did like Plowan's ideas on having the children help around the house, getting more organized, and of course surrounding yourself in loving relationships. Please do not think that this book is all about spanking because it is just one brief topic."
4,The Sociological Quest,This is used for study sociology and is easy to understand and informative. It is advised reading for sociology students and helps to grasp the idea of sociology.
2,Looks good. Looks are deceiving...,"I got this pedal for my new M-audio Keystation 61es. From the time a felt the pedal I knew trouble was coming... out of the box, it feels really sturdy, a bit TOO sturdy and playing for he first time works your calves well. Within about two hours of jamming on my midi controller, one of the screws fell off at the side... wow! what a disappointment :(. Luckily i THINK i have a plan... the screws determine how soft the pedal would be but they will keep falling out because there is nothing to keep it sturdy on the inside... i'll try to find some knots to suit and install them on the inside to keep the screws in place. this should help but I havent tried it yet... guess I'll have to wait to see..."
4,nice cheap pedal,"Haven't used it that much to give it 5 stars but for the price, looks like it does the job for what its worth. Definitely for beginner keyboard players."
4,Partner for my M-Audio Avid AXIOM,This pedal works well and is compatible with Avid M-Audio Axiom I use.There is nothing better than buying a suit
4,Does What it Says,Bought for use with my M-Audio Oxygen 61. Plugged it in and it worked. The pedal is a little stiff which makes it a little difficult to keep it pressed for a long period on carpet. Some people talk about the finicky switch on the inside but I've had no issues to date.
4,Good Enough for Me,"This pedal seems to work pretty well, especially considering the price. I couldn't find many pedals that had my keyboard (Casio CTK-650) listed for compatibility. This pedal's claim of any keyboard holds true for this one.The only negative I've found is it seems like the physical click sound of the pedal button is a little louder than I would have liked.All in all, this pedal seems good for the price."
4,meditations,"If you know what you're getting into these films are stunning. They are strong transfers and demonstrate the Eclipse Series' usual attention. I love these detailed, almost OCD, examinations and the characters that inhabit them."
5,Not Enough Stars Exist,"Where has Chantal Akerman been all my life? Her films are glorious, gorgeous, tense and absolute. Stunning. Do not live another minute without this collection. It will change your life."
2,Hotel Monterey....nothingness,"In error, my husband preset my recorder at 5:30 AM to copy this film on TCM (I meant to record Death of a Scoundrel at 5:30 PM). I checked here to learn why Hotel Monterey was silent when TCM lists it as a documentary. What a shock to discover that this film is considered Art, and one reviewer compares the photographer to the wonderful existential painter, Edward Hopper. Well, most anyone can make a similar film by focusing on a limited setting for an extended period of time but very few people can paint like Edward Hopper. Well, to each his own. At least I didn't lose money on it, or much time since I fast forwarded, stopping only when I saw a change in movement, which wasn't often. At the end the camera finally moves to the outside for a breath of fresh air and a view of some NYC buildings, so for that I'll give it 2 stars."
2,Disappointing.....,"As a enthusiast of these wonderful autos, I WANTED to like this, but I found this ""guide"" very general and lacking any real depth. There aren't any books out there that deal with these two subjects in this format. This may be why as the publication is nothing short of disappointing. Two stars may be construed as generous to a real automobile book critic."
3,Purchasing Backjoy from BackJoy web site,I would not order this product from the BackJoy web site. You could get trapped into ordering more than one. It happened to me. I filed a comlaint with the BBB.
2,bearly noticed,"I received this product ~ 1 month ago, i am 24 years old having back problem for 1 year now. i can't sit for too long (no more than 1 hour). I was hoping that this product will do like how they advertise it. Unfortunately I was unable to find it very helpful. I still cannot sit any longer than i did. I wish the product will present data of how effective it works for the general population. Without it no consumer can be protected for a bad product."
2,seat,"Didn't get much out of this product...but then again I only tried it for a few minutes and the insert said have to try it out for a while. When life slows down, i will try it again"
3,BackJoy Portable Orthotic for chair,"I've been using this device at home where I spend inordinate amounts of time sitting at the computer. I photoedit and participate in various online photo forums. I'd been having difficulty arising to standing after prolonged periods at the computer. I think maybe this device is helping somewhat. It's so hard to say. I'm certainly no worse than if I hadn't been using it. I'm a physical therapist by profession, and the device looked intriguing. I know I shouldn't be spending such long periods sitting, but when working at something you enjoy, time flies before you know it. I'm only rating it as a 3/5, rather middle of the road, because it certainly hasn't ""wowed"" me."
5,"Loved the first one so much, I bought another one","I bought one and used it the first day it was delivered. It really does what the description says. I continuously have lumbar support problems no matter what kind of chair I sit in. The Backjoy alleviates the issue. I really notice a huge difference in my car, because my car seat slopes down from the bottom of my knees to my rear. The Backjoy makes up for the terrible car seat design. I got tired of carrying around one BackJoy between my car and my office, so I bought a second one. It's that good"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"As far as I can tell, BackJoy does nothing. Save your money for something else."
1,Found BackJoy to be Worthless,"I did order the BackJoy product with high hopes, gave it a try for 30 days. I did not see any improvement, in fact, I noticed more pain & discomfort. While trying to return the item, I found that dealing with their customer service was a very bad experience. Since I was getting the run around from the salesman, I politely asked to speak to a manager & he responded that there were 6 supervisors on the floor but none of them would come to the phone. Needless to say I am NOT a satisfied customer. BackJoy is a rip off - don't waste your time or money."
2,not so,"I found this product to be very firm to sit on. While it did help with the spinal discomfort, that was replaced by sit bone discomfort. After a week I had to return it, I felt like I was riding on a hard bike seat all day. I have to say I am thin and that does make me a lover of memory foam, so this product was not the one for me."
3,"good on hard surfaces, not so good in bucket seats","I've had this product for two months. I liked its size and portability - it fit in my daypack so I could take it on the plane. Just as the instructions say - it works best on a hard chair. I used it in the rental car and it helped some, but the stiff foam of the BackJoy is not quite stiff enough, nor does it raise my hips higher than my knees, which is what I need for my hips and lower back.On a firm surface it definitely brings you into a more upright position, on your ""sit-bones""."
2,Not thrilled with Back Joy,"This product probably works for some people but I still have my back ache. That might not be the product's fault. There are many causes of back ache, & I am not so nieve as to think this product can fix them all. It was worth a try, it just didn't work out as I had hoped. The service was very good, very fast, & they werequite willing to try to please me in any way reasonable. Try it, you might like it."
3,Hard-backed chair required,"I had to return my BackJoy because it didn't work in my office, home or car. The product works well in a hard-backed/hard-seated chair only. Unfortunately, most office chairs are not designed that way, nor is most living room/den furniture (not to mention car seats). I hope the company updates the BackJoy for effective use with soft furniture."
1,Too good to be true,"It took a while to arrive. Not as sturdy as they claim, and it lost its shape after 3 weeks, I did not feel any improvement in my back pain. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I rate it 1 star, but if I could I would give it zero star."
4,Back/Butt Support,"If you have severe back pain, this is not a cure all. While it did not alleviate back pain, it did provide some firm support while sitting on a soft surface. It has to be positioned just right and cup the buttocks. It took about two weeks to get used to it. I use it at work and sometimes at home. I don't use it in the car. For some reason, it is not comfortable while driving."
3,BackJoy,"I give this a ""fair."" I'm not sure if it does anything at all other than in the car. The McKenzie Method (roll pillow at the small of the back) seems to do better in most circumstances.The BackJoy is not nearly as portable as they make it seem in their online adds. It does not fold easily and if you force it to fold it is still a large mass that does not fit in any bag I carry. It doesn't pack well and doesn't do well for sitting up in bed (mattress defeats the supposed function). It doesn't do well in some ergonomic chairs (desk chairs). It is also very hot causing me to sweat a lot!I still use it in the car, where it seems to be most effective - there, it actually DOES prevent back pain from long rides."
5,Balance,"I have not yet seen this film. I plan to buy the DVD when it comes out--at which point I may end up changing my rating. But for now, I simply wanted to function as a counter to the 1-star reviews which offered no analysis of the film whatsoever. Their tirade seemed to be, in effect: ""This film is about Che. I don't like Che. Therefore, this film is bad.""I tend to like Soderbergh's work, but I will withhold judgment until I've actually viewed the film, and can put together a sentence or two that a) avoids the usage of meaningless epithets such as ""America haters,"" and b) demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the film--even if I have any issues with it."
3,Great movie but DVD is a rip off,"For $30+ and you don't even get a theatrical trailer!? Seriously, there is absolutely NOTHING on this disc except the movie(which is awesome)! What a freakin' jip!"
1,CHE,"This movie tries to portrait the life of a misguided rich spoiled Argentinean who tried ignited chaos in many Latin American countries in the name of social justice. This movie patronizes the life of a man who actions cause the lives of many people. Che study medicine and is often refer as Doctor but he never saved any lives but instead too many lives. As a man from Latin America who have witness some of the consequences of revolutionaries, I encourage anyone interested in Che to read the real history and results of Che produce is his vision of changing the world. I can not believe that Americans think this guy was cool or a humanitarian when he was neither."
3,Che in Spanish language,"the product description did not specify that this movie was in Spanish with optional English subtitles. Since it was an American made movie, it was unclear and I was unpleasantly surprised when I watched it and had to read subtitles for almost 4 hours."
1,Unbelievable,"I just can't understand how any American can look up to this murderous scumbag for inspiration and hope! It's like saying ""hey I think Adolf Hitler is cool and I'm going to wear a t-shirt with his face depicted on it,"" give me a break! Che was a cold blooded murderer who along side Castro butchered thousands of people, and any American who thinks this guy had something to share with the world is a moron. This movie depicts Che as being some kind of sympathetic character--now how can a cold-blooded murderer be a sympathetic character? I normally like Soderbergh's films, but this atrocity isn't good. He could have given the viewer an accurate rendering of this sociopath but instead were given this liberal garbage--truly disappointing. Che was truly a disgusting human being--if you can even call him a human being!"
4,Interesting,It was interesting to watch but I don't get the fascination with the guy. Not sure how people would and could consider him a hero. Also expensive.
5,great film,"very good film about controversial and beloved figure of 20th centuryusual high standards of Criterion Collectionwhat's up with all those dimwits giving this film one star? you are reviewing a movie not a person, Che is not available for purchase on amazon.com"
2,Revolutionaries can be boring,"Che is a four-hour plus film that really tests the patience of the average viewer. The film falls way short of reasonable expectations on several levels.First, the film starts with a fully radicalized Che; with no background story on how the privileged doctor Ernesto became revolutionary communist Che. Without the back story of his evolution, it's hard to understand ""where he is coming from"".Second, the film ignores his allegedly extremely violent manner and bloodthirsty executions he ordered on thousands of Cubans who were thought to be enemies of the state after Castro came into power.Third, the film ignores his journey to the Congo. Something interesting must have happened there.Fourth, the film spends hours showing Che and his band of guerillas wandering about the Bolivian mountains. Not that interesting.I could go on, but despite the good acting by Benicio Del Toro, and some good cinematography, the movie is ultimately quite a disappointment."
1,"Sick, Sick, Sick",What kind of sick mind could produce such a piece of hagiography? Why does this sociopath continue to exert such a hold on the maiden-aunt sensibilities of North American liberals? Nothing short of a perverse taste for vicarious violence or a closeted taste for rough trade can explain it.
1,I don't see any reason to read this book,"I thought this was going to be a science-based look at howour eyes and brains ""see"" the world. Instead, it's basicallya diary of the author's random thoughts about what and how we see. There's absolutely no scientific information and barelyany proof of his assertions. His prose is nice occasionally, butif you want to actually learn anything, do not buy this book."
5,Insight on the nature of sight,"Elkins' thoughts on sight and seeing is a multifaceted deconstruction on how we view and are viewed by objects we encounter. It's a subject that we take for granted and draw large assumptions about. Elkins proposes seeing as a metaphor for the life cycle: we awake groggy-eyed like a newborn, go through our day with vigor and energy observing and absorbing, and return to darkness in sleep like blindness and death.Tied together with many personal anecdotes with flowing use of language, the book is an insight for those interested in post-structuralist analysis of idea, communication, and sight."
4,"well-done, interesting, but needs a warning...","The main reason I posted this review is to warn readers that some of the images in this book may be disturbing. I thought it was well-written and fascinating. However, if I had known what I was going to encounter, I never would have opened it. The sexual images are tasteful and not overly graphic, but I was bothered by the death and torture photos. There are some things I just don't want to see if I can avoid them.Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with this kind of thing being published. I would not have it ""banned"" or interfere with its distribuition. I just wish that someone had told me it's not for the squeamish.If these kinds of things don't bother you, then it's worth the read."
2,"James Elkins, The Object Stares Back","James Elkins gives a lot of interesting speculation on the experience of seeing, but unfortunately, he fails to give much linkage of his subject to the experience of making and seeing art, which is curious in that the author is an art historian. He attaches a lot of importance to the idea that conventional seeing is a form of ""blindness,"" that is, that conventional day-to-day seeing is extremely limited, but, again, he seems to be uninterested in the ways that artists remove these limits, both for themselves and their audience. So much of the writing is about how the author himself sees and does not see, that eventually I became bored, as one usually does listening to one person talk on and on about his own limited experience of a subject."
2,"Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained: This Time The Latter","One of the first records I ever bought was Pledge of Love by Ken Copeland, but the B side was Night Air by the (Four) Mints which I thought was really cool and that's why I bought this CD. I still think it's cool. Except for another version of Pledge of Love by Dave Tanner, which I had never heard before, this CD has songs that were understandably left off the charts, but I kind of like Tanner's version of Pledge of Love."
1,so pooly done,"what a waste... not the music but the video production. aviod this one, it will distroy your fond memories of Tull from our youth."
4,Rockin' tastefully...,"...as you would expect from Mr. Dolan. I kinda like 5style better but things change, people change. This album is killer though, it's got cool riffs and that signature Bill Dolan tone. Check it out."
1,Boring and Empty,"This movie is all style and no substance. It relies on visual hurly burly alternating with visual stasis to make it seem as if something's happening. There's no story, or not enough. It plunges the main character into this world of hustlers and drugs and trannies without having really established who he is or why he's drawn to these people. Someone praised the script and the acting, but it felt like weak improv to me, and there's not much script to speak of. I watched Latter Days last week and that was much better--story, rich characterizations and real acting, not this posing and strutting and pouting."
2,More Soft Porn Than Movie,"I enjoy softcore and hardcore pornography as much as any sexual gay male, but I, also, enjoy a provocative and challenging gay-related movie. This movie is unfortunately in a line of commercial gay films that titilate more than mentally or emotionally stimulate. The acting itself was not bad in itself, but the preponderance of substance abuse gives us the idea that all gay youth struggling for identity and acceptance turn to drugs for their journey to self-acceptance. The softcore pron in the movie was pleasant enough but was out of place for me. There are times when showing less is more creative and stimulating than showing it all. See the movie once, but I would recommend buying it."
3,A Bit of a Let Down,"Almost worth getting for the hotness that is Brendan Fehr, plus the unexpected cutie Andre Noble (which I wouldn't have thought so much from the cover); however, their isn't nearly enough skin shown by the two. Plus, the one sex scene between them typifies the entire movie for me: far more brutal and corse than beautiful and endearing.If you think you're getting a tender coming of age/boy's first time movie where he falls in love and recuses the down and out hustler guy with lots (as in more than one excuse for) sex scenes, then you're in for a BIG disappointment.None of which is to say its a bad movie. The little sister Cookie is a total hoot and probably the most interesting character overall actually. Queer As Folk fans will recognize Cliff's wonderful Mother as being the same actress who played Hunter's evil mom.It is to say, rent this first before you decide to buy. Otherwise you might be stuck with a movie you'll only ever watch once. (All the way through anyway ;)"
3,More Like Artificial Sweetener...,"This was supposed to be a love story, but really it wasn't. A coming of age tale, no more of a morality play on the evils of drug use. Newly 18, a boy goes out from suburbia to the destitute areas of downtown, immediately hooks up with a hustler who doesn't do ""the gay thing"" falls madly in love anyway, starts taking drugs and turning tricks as well. For someone inexperienced he sure caught on quickly. I was very disappointed with ""Sugar."" I didn't like the overall feel of the movie. It was dark and unfriendly, a poor man's version of ""Kids."" The performances were good, and it was nice to see a gay story told without flinching, and the male nudity kept peeking my interest. Not grat entertainment, but worth viewing."
1,Sand in the Sugar,"Q: What do you get when you mix a bad screenplay with no plot, unbelievable situations like the little sister, bad production values and scenes inserted only to shock (pardon the pun) like the servicing of the 500 lb. woman? A: Sugar!Cliff has an identity crisis. Big deal. So what? Which one of us hasn't at some point in our lives? So he turns to drugs and hustling. I know that was my chosen path of enlightenment.Unlikable characters, flimsy plot, bad production values (everything is so dark I had to adjust the brightness on my monitor) and situations that are so far-fetched they are more appropriate for a comic book. This trashy film asks us to suspend disbelief so often you'll feel like you were hired by your local electric company to string power lines.Other reviewers have called this film gritty. It's gritty, all right. Gritty like sand in your sugar."
1,Absolutely awful!,"Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene ""coming of age"" wannabes. It has been done much better in ""Johns"" and in Showtime's ""Queer As Folk."" Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment. Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief. This movie has nothing to recommend it. No stars is my rating. But, thanks, Amazon, for finding me a buyer of my DVD copy through my Marketplace selling account."
4,Great movie!,"The movie is great, disc itself was flawless however the case came in cracked, which was no big deal I just slid out the cover paper and slid it into an extra case I had... If the case wouldn't have been cracked and uncloseable I would've rated 5* for sure! I recommend this movie and seller!"
2,try something else,"With gay cinema sometimes you have to take what you can get. Unfortunately for me this movie was awful. My roommates and I watched this movie and none of us enjoyed it, there were moments when we felt like turning it off. I really have to recommend to anyone considering buying this movie to rent it first. For me personally it is money wasted and I never plan on watching again! Also, why is the movie image so crappy looking?"
1,Horrible...,"Has no story line, makes no sense, and is essentially a waste of money. Bad acting also."
2,morbid and loss of potential,"When I ordered this film I thought that I would find a story about two people trying ot find their way through life..blah blah blah......nope. The characters are wooden and boring except one of the two main actor's youger sister who deals drugs adding the only humor in the story. The characters just pick up and go on with their lives like nothing happened in the end leaving you to wonder how human can they really be? If you're looking for something with heart and content...wrong movie. If you're looking for something with these qualities and is erotic? Wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie with a let down ending and tons of graphic nauseating sex between Brendan Ferh and a large woman then here's your movie. Go for something like Latter Days or if you're really into sad endings but good movies go for ""The Trip."""
3,"An assortment of 12"" versions and radio edits...","Once again, Billboard doesn't do a full 12"" collection. The club mixes here are: Let The Music Play (5:49), The Safety Dance (4:36), Lies (5:24)(this is actually an edit of the 12"" version!), Pilot Error (6:25), Do it Again/Billie Jean (7:24), Angel Man (7:05). The other mixes are all singles versions. I sure wish they had put the 12"" version of Fascination by the Human League, considering it's only 4 minutes long and has never been on CD."
4,velvet overground,I remember not particularly liking Psychocandy although relistening to the debut many years later provided a whole new perspective and more acquiesence than expected. Munki is an archetypical view to Lou Reed's best input circa Velvet Underground pale blue eyes and waiting for my man etc. Add the feroucious turbo energy of the brothers Reid (misspelled Reed) and you've got something to last a while and win people over with. Like myself.
3,what progression are these people talking about???,"Ok, I love the JAMC & have been a fan for a LONG time. But this album is a disappointment. It's just different versions of the same one boring song they played over and over on ""Sound of Speed"", with various minor changes and under various different names. I still love the band, but I just don't see how they've progressed at all here."
5,Diaper Genie Refills,This is such an easy way to dispose of all these messy diapers! I have twin baby girls so there is twice the mess! This is a big help. Buying the refills in quantity is also a money saver!
2,Not designed very well,The lid is not secure and the rollers do not sit properly on the heating device so everything falls apart easily. The edges of the rollers get very hot so they are hard to handle.The unit does heat up quickly.
3,Not perfect but does the job,"I'm happy to have a travel set that has fat rollers - this set has the biggest rollers of the travel sets out there. Like other reviewers have noted, the rollers dont sit perfectly on the heating element - if they tilt even slightly the plastic rim at the bottom can melt and smell bad. It would also be cool if there was a travel bag for the set. But overall it works ok - heats up fast, curls hair wellh"
2,Too hot to handle,Rollers heat up quick but I have to use a glove on the hand that handles the rollers because they are so hot you can't touch them. It's the plastic ends on the rollers that get the hottest. Need to be careful with these because they will burn your skin or ears. I would not recommend buying them. They need to be re-engineered with a material on the ends that won't burn your fingers or skin. I'm surprised these ever made it to the market in the first place.
2,not great,"As noted by a previous reviewer, the unit is not designed well. Lid does not stay secure (an important point when traveling,) and the rollers have little contact with the heating source and easily topple. On the plus side, it will work in any country and i love the large size of the rollers."
2,"Good curlers, just not for travel","I really like these curlers - thy heat up fast, and you would think they would be good for traveling since there are only 5 of them. However, the lid does not snap on or stay in place, so it was constantly being shifted around in my suitcase and didn't take long to crack in multiple places. Also, the clips tend to leave indentions in my hair - would rather have the wire U-shaped clips."
1,Travel Curlers,"The travel curlers are compact, however, they get too hot and have burned my face a few times. It is better to leave the cover off when they are heating. Also, the curlers do not fit on the base very well, and you have to put a rubber band over the whole thing to make it stay in the case while it is in your suitcase. The clips included are totally useless. They will not stay on at all."
1,Don't purchase,"This item has flaws that make it useless. In order of what happened when I tried to use this: 1) the rollers took a LONG time to heat up, 2) they were burning hot, 3) then they were impossible to hold. You can't get a grip on the one little post on the end - even if you could, you can't hold it by the one end and get it in your hair. I never even got to the point of trying to use the clips, but they didn't look like they'd work.The Price Pros were great and gave me a prompt refund when I returned it. I have no gripe with them except they should not try to sell these rollers."
2,Complicated! Too much Gadgetry Needed!,"This workout requires at least 4 different fitness gadgets in order to be done correctly and be effective. The instructor doesn't tell you but you are going to have to go out and buy hand weights (that's the easy one. Most people have these.) Then however, she uses these little purple pillow blocks, step stools of different heights, mat, a balance stick and you have to keep them close by and interchange them for each workout. For me at least, I found the workout too complicated and cumbersome, switching workout gadgets. I gave it two stars because she does atleast have some good choreography moves which I enjoyed. I just want something simple and user-friendly to achieve the most optimal results. This for me, was NOT it."
5,Megalithic Mysteries Demystified,"Everything you always wanted to know about Stone Circles but were too afraid to ask...Robin Heath's very readable style explains how neolithic civilisations would have planned, measured, and even built their fantastic astronomic calculators. Find out how the geometry and measuring systems of these people were linked to the Sun and the Moon's rotational periods, and even how to build your own stone circles!"
5,Touchdown Review,"For someone who had no prior knowledge of the recruiting process, Ed's book was a real treat. It was especially helpful having a professional like Jurevicius add his commentary. The only suggestion I have is to include a picture of the author inside the back cover so the public can see the genius that put this work together."
4,Truly Tasteless Jokes: The Video,"If you love the best-selling books, you love this video. There are some great acts including ""The Renegade Whiteman"" Ollie Joe Prater and Marsha Warfield with small clips of the infamous Andrew ""Dice"" Clay. In between acts, there are jokes told by audience members. If you're into truly tasteless jokes, this video is for you. Caution: There is harsh language but that's what this is supposed to be."
1,Truly Tasteless Jokes..Special Edition,it was not the original full video ..i guess special edition meant especially short and edited from the original edition
4,bittersweet religious tribute to Virgin Mary,"review from other site:This is a challenging recording, both in its rough and ragged tone and in its mix of content. The bothers Lorenzo and Enzo Mancuso are from Sicily, but their music was sharpened by years as immigrants in England. Those years gave them exposure to many cultures from the Mediterranean, as well as a political viewpoint that subtly colors some of what you will hear on this recording. Using the devotional and folk music of Sicily as a starting point, the Mancusos and fellow traveler Antonio Marangolo merge their harsh vocal style with woodwinds, brass, strings, sax, accordion, and percussion in a soundscape as arid and yet as beautiful as the island. This is almost entirely mournful music, leaning heavily on religious themes in this strange and sometimes bittersweet tribute to the power of the Virgin Mary. This is a deep, richly layered recording that requires effort and rewards you for it. --Louis Gibson"
3,amor se dice cantando,"Es una coproduccion mexico-argentina muy bien realizada por un buen elencode artistas de esos dos paises. Donde se destaca la voz del gran cantante mexicano Miguel Aceves Mejia. Lo malo es que la pel√≠cula original era en colores y la reproducci√≥n de la misma en DVD es en blanco y negro, por lo que pierde belleza y atractivo en general."
5,"""Excellent!!!""",The Pernice Brothers have set the tone for 'perfect pop' for the millennium! A must own.
4,Brian Wilson meets the Byrds...,"I recently got the current Pernice Brothers album(The World Won't Listen), which I love, and when I subsequently went to see them live, they played songs from this album that were so good I had to get this record as well. I'm glad I did, because the whole album is terrific, not as great as TWWL, but not far behind either. Right from the opening notes of the first song, ""Crestfallen"", Joe Pernice is in total command of his melodies. What little I knew of the band before purchasing any of the records led me to believe they were more country than pop, but it's the other way around. The short track ""Sick Of You"" sounds like it could have come off of 'Pet Sounds', and the title track is a lovely, nuanced song that reminds me of Burt Bacharach's more elegant compositions. The record is full of memorable hooks that make you feel OK for listening to pop music. Highly recommended."
2,Overcome by Mediocrity,"Some instrumentation is reminiscent of the late 60's, early 70's. Most of the album is slow, nondescript Alternative music. The only song of note is spoiled by a ""Tiajuana Brass"" style trumpet solo."
5,GREAT,"I love this bag, it's so versatile, holds plenty, and still feels light and easy, looks sharp, I love it"
5,Nice and usefull tool,"Wery usefull tool i primary use it to clean the corn left by the tumbler, also to clean the primer pocket again ***** five starts"
3,works ok,It works ok but you have to lock tight the end as it tends to unscrew the more you use it. but since I lock tighted the threads have had no problems with it.
3,Not bad for a TV soundtrack,"I've bought a few TV soundtracks over the years and have sometimes been dissatisfied by them. I rarely remember the selections as being used in the series, The 4400 is no exception but at least it seems to have a nice sound to it.About all that really stood out for me was the theme song, #1 ""A Place in Time"" (really the only reason I even bought the CD) and I think I remember #11 ""Salvation"" being used at some point. The rest of the selections don't mean much to me but they're a good fit and if you like one you'll probably like most of the rest. The worst piece was #12, the instrumental version of the theme- instrumental adaptations rarely work well and this was no exception."
4,impressive soundscape to the t.v. series,"* first of all, the 4400 was a great series- great writing and actors. Seasons 2 & 4 were my favorite (there are a total of 4 seasons).being a fan of the series, I was interested in the soundtrack as well. The songs are from various bands and are an eclectic mix. Most of the themes of the songs deal with alienation of some sort. This fits with the series since the series was about people with special powers and the alienation that felt because of it, and the governmental persecution of them out of fear and the need to control them. Some of the bands I had never heard of before, but was pleasantly surprised after hearing their music.* highly recommended *"
4,Fits the Mood of the Show,"Judged on its own, this would probably get a 3-star rating. Rated by knowing the show, it should get 5 stars, but the last track is worth a demotion of one star (it's that bad). Most music must be enjoyed according to your mood, and this CD gives one an eerie feeling, almost depressing, but the beauty of it keeps it above the depressive level. Like the series, there's a chill to the overall tone with just enough hope in there to emulate the series to perfection.Aye, the opening song (the best cut) is WAY too short: I thought like the Geico theme song, ""Remind Me,"" there was surely a longer version. Still even at just over a minute, it's worth buying. Very moody, but very worth listening to!"
2,Batteries Plus has the CR-1/3N for $4.99,"For those of you replacing the button battery yourself and don't want to pay for shipping, My local Batteries Plus has the CR-1/3N for $4.99 and in stock. I'm going to buy a few after work today. I did get advertised 3 months out of my two PetSafe Cats shock collars and they were on the whole time, but I'm using them with the Indoor Radio Fence to keep my cats off my expensive surround speakers so maybe they don't get shocked as much as an in-ground fence. BTW, Home Depot has very reasonable prices on these collars and PetSafe stuff, some you have to order and some is available in store. I bought from them because I didn't like giving my CC info to some random small site online that I never heard of before and I can return the PetSafe stuff to any Home Depot if it doesn't work out for me but so far so good."
1,Lasts only about 1 month,I use this battery for a dog collar from PetSafe. The first time I used the battery and it went dead within a month I just replaced it thinking it was a bad battery. The second one went dead in about a month as well. I wrote an e-mail to PetSafe and they said that was about right. They said the collar was meant as a training device only. The problem is that I have a very smart dog and when his batter goes dead he knows because the hidden wire no long makes his collar click and he goes running into the street. $9 a pop for the replacement batter makes this collar pretty expensive. It owuld have been cheaper to build a fence.
1,"Yes, Replace it Yourself","Following advice from other reviewers, I took the module apart and removed the battery. I'm not a handy person but there was nothing to it. I just ordered six replacement batteries online for less than what Petsafe charges for two. Considering how fast they burn out, buying them for my two cats from petsafe would cost me over $100 a year. This way it will be less than $35."
1,Bad Product!,"I purchased a ""little Dog"" radio fence from Petsafe and the fence is excellent, but the ""little dog"" collars are eating up batteries. The collars nice and small but if I get 3 weeks from one of these batteries then I am lucky. DO NOT BUY the little dog collars!"
1,Rip of Business Model,"It is bad enough that the battery only lasts a month, instead of 3 as advertised. But, Petsafe intentionally put an ordinary, over the counter battery in a proprietary holder so that you as the customer would be compelled to buy a replacement from them at almost ten dollars a piece. On top of that, they charge $10 for standard shipping, when it should cost under a dollar for first class mail for such a tiny item. Don't pay the 500% profit to these rip-off artists and do yourself a favor and spend a few minutes cracking open the housing and replacing the battery yourself for little under $3. I will not buy from Petsafe again because of their greed and gouging."
1,Petsafe Battery Review,The Petsafe Battery does not live up to the specs that indicate that it will be approximately 3 months life. One of the recent batteries I purchased was completely dead in 2 weeks. Typical is 2 months.
1,dies in about a month,"I've run through 3 of these.. .I keep meaning to break it apart and stick in a generic $3 battery, but haven't gotten around to it.I have a tiny little dog that doesn't get anywhere near the fence, so the collar doesn't go off and yet the batteries last less than a month??!!Petsafe.. come on.. . get with it.. make a rechargeable version, make it so we can put less expensive batteries in or something. 8 or 10 bucks a month is a bit too much.Don't buy the ""little dog collar""."
1,Ripoff,"The battery dies in 1 month, that is outrageous. Read Pronoman's comment on how to save your selves alot of money."
3,"Doesn't eliminate all sounds, but does the trick.","I have a lab mix who has some serious separation anxiety. Whenever I leave, she feels compelled to bark until I get home. The battery voltage is strong enough to stop her barking though she will still whimper because she has learned exactly how loud she can whimper before she gets shocked. Overall, I am satisfied."
1,"Great fence, awful battery design","THe Petsafe Invisible fence works fantastic, and I bought a standard size collar for my lab. The battery life, and overall performance is terrific. We got a second much smaller dog, and I made the mistake of buying the Petsafe Ultralight collar. It cost twice as much as the full size collar to start with, and as other reviewers have stated, the $10-$14 battery only lasts about 3 weeks, which makes the ongoing cost unacceptable."
1,1 Month Battery Life,Battery lasts only 1 month. Unless of course you turn your battery off at night or during the day when you're at work. Then I see some people saying it can last 2 months. Whoopee. Still a really bad product.
2,bad battery,"The collar its pretty small comparing to other models, but this batteries only last about 3 weeks to a month , wich make this device pretty expensive!!!! my fault for not reading the reviews before getting this system...."
2,petsafe battery,this battery lasts only about 1 month and has to be replaced. It is quite expensive as the are $9.99 each.My larger collar for a second dog only needs replacement every 6 months.
2,Great System -- Low Battery Life on Collar,"I love this in-ground fence and the little dog collar is a nice design. However, I have gone through six batteries in four months. I called PetSafe about the battery life and they said it should last 1 to 3 months. I'm getting 3 to 4 weeks out of a battery and this is becoming quite expensive. The PetSafe representative was extremely helpful. Because the collar is less than a year old, they (for a small fee) exchanged the collar for a different type."
3,Battery Life Seems Appropriate,My first battery expired after 8 weeks or use. The 'correction' setting was 2nd highest and the collar was shut-off at night; worn virtually all day. I may try to reduce the power setting as the dog is now 'trained'. The PetSafe Training Guide advised a 3 to 6 month life. A little short of expectation.
3,eh,"I bought this product because I am a big fan of ketchup and wanted to try something different. I used the super saver shipping and when i opened the box half of the bottles were broken. In the picture, it shows what appear to be plastic bottle, but what i received were glass bottles. I could only salvage about 4 of the 12 bottles. As for the actual product it was just ok. The ketchup is not spicy or hot and just mediocre. I would prefer to use plain old Heinz instead. Really nothing special. If you want to give it a shot, beware the super saver shipping!"
4,what we need is a bultaco history book,"strictly on bultacos, ossa montesa, etc an in debth history of each bikes definative histories with many pics and descriptions, its been needed a long time now! definative {most complete} histories on each dirt bike, trials bikes and bultaco rider jim pomeroy and photos of him his bikes, etc to finally close bultacos much deserving great history. bultacos will never die! they deserve the credit and recognition; along with the other spanish dirt/tials bikes etc that go along with bultacos."
1,Big Disappointment,"They never have worked right, bought them in the winter and when I removed them they look better than my old ones but one never worked correctly. I had bought them months earlier or I would have returned them, not worth the money. I do not recommend."
1,Terrible. do not waste your money,"I do not know what is wrong with the manufacturers of these garden torches, but they all suck. I have a LED Lenser flashlight with a SINGLE p7 LED that illumiates out to 500' on 4 AAA batteries for hours. Yet these things have 12 LEDs and they are nothing more than ""glow in the dark"" bright. And the pole is nothing more than the thinest, cheapest plastic you have ever seen. I mounted one in the garden, and one good wind gust snapped the pole within days.If you want a decoration and never get any wind, fine. But if you really want to use the light from these forget it. A butane lighter will put out more light.If anyone knows of a real solar garden torch that puts out enough light to light up a typical back yard (assumeing 6-12 torches) please let me know. Thank you!"
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"Extremely bad and poorly executed. Filled with colorful vulgar languages and pretentious, fake accents, it is easy for viewers to see how self conscious the actors and actresses are. Eric Khoo tries too hard to be artistic and philosophical (through Bunny's diary), but turns out to be mundane and shallow. The movie is made by a novice film maker with poor filming techniques. Do not waste your time and money - it's a pain to watch this movie!"
4,No Warnings Required,"I stumbled across these guys on a punk meets grunge sampler and was so hit with the two songs on the disc I needed more. I'm not a North-Westerner so have no sense of the bands local/regional history or impact but I can tell you that if you are thinking ""grunge"" you are probably on the wrong track. This is grunge only in the way that early Soundgarden (pre-Superunkown - and their only really great output) can be called ""grunge"". Duff McKagan and the band rock hard but tightly and Christopher Blue contributes some nice snarling vocals. I've had this for four or five years and still toss it into the CD player when I need a good kick in the rear. ""Mezz"" and ""Is this the way?"" are favorite tracks but there is not a miss on the entire disc."
5,Great Southern Recipies,Every recipe that I've tried from this book has been a hit with my family and friends. I've had it since it first came out in '85 and it's beginning to look tattered but I wouldn't trade it for a new one because all through it are notes about when I served what and how much we liked it. My son won best of show at a fair in '89 with the chocolate pie and every summer we enjoy zucchini squares. The perfect pie crust recipe is in this book along with exquisite fillings for them. The salads are also high on my list. Was looking to see if Suzanne and Gay had a new one out yet when I saw the review request. I'm looking forward to a new cookbook from them.
5,foundations for a new comprehensive religious theory,"Talbott has laid the cornerstone for a revolutionary and brilliant approach towards explaining mythology and ritual from a historical point of view. His work is clear and convincing, though several details cannot be maintained. Unlike Velikovsky's he works his ideas out in detail and opens the way for multitudes of new ideas. This book might even exceed Velikovsky's work in importance as it does certainly so in scope."
2,revue,"I'm glad it was free. It was rambling, hard to follow, and not what I expected of a writer that was rammed down our throats in high school."
2,"Flashy, but too poor quality for the price","I totally concur with David, this car is nice looking but not very useful as a pedal car. I purchased the car fo my daughter and she hardly ever plays with it. The pedals are hard to use and prone to jamming. In addition, the steering is a joke. The steering wheel is flimsy and fastened only by one nut. The mechanism would not allow you to turn the wheel more that a few degrees each way so turning is nearly impossible or too laborious for a child. I found the padding on the seat too thin and the metal edges in some areas too sharp for a toy. A kid could really get injured in one of these things."
1,NOT worth the money!!,"This was a complete disaster! 1st: Incredibly difficult to put together; 2nd: Incredibly expensive; 3rd: The tires aren't level so it won't roll properly; 4th: My 4 year old can't work the ""simple"" push/pull of the pedals; 5th: Shabby construction -- my husband had to go buy replacement screws and nuts just to hold it together; 6th: The steering is a joke.There are only two good things about this toy: 1. It looks amazing, and 2. I got it for half-price, so I don't feel TOO embarrassed for buying such a pile of you-know-what."
2,Not what I expected,I purchased this album because I found the song Choombachang through Pandora. The rest of the album seems to be jazz-for-the-sake-of-noise type music. I love jazz when it has some sort of direction but a lot of this album just sounds like just random noise.
2,His questions are good...but his reason is flawed,"Spong asks wonderful questions that draw honest reactions from literalists and fundamentalists alike. He calls us to contextually look into a scripture that we so often literalisticly destroy with our narrow linear interpretations. BUT...if Sprong and others are right, that the bible is not the ""Word of God"", and Jesus was not the ACTUAL Son of God...than anything we choose to think or do is valid because we are under no authority (save what society deems lawful) other than our own conscience and our own personal interpretation of right/wrong and an ambigious personal definition of ""God is Love"".This is not the truth."
1,Definitions please!,"Well, one must ask the Rt. Rev. Spong what a fundamentalist is? According to this book, anyone who considers Jesus Christ as Lord or the Bible as the Inspired and Truthful Word of God, is a fundamentalist. As a faithful believer in the Reformed Faith, I find it hard to identify with my brethern on the far right...as well as pseudochristians on the far left. I'm as much of a fundamentalist...as Spong is a Christian. A Christian isn't just a person who does good works (although they are worthy of praise)--A Christian is in a relationship with God. This book views such a loving (and real) relationship with a living God as worthy of contempt. If you're looking for a passionate voice of Christian thought, see Barthe, Bonhoffer, or Lewis. Spong may as very well be agnostic after writing such a book as this."
1,An Ironic Title and Message,Imagine a wolf telling us that sheep need to be rescued from shepherds. That is essentially what Spong does. He denies every essential claim of Scripture and then has the temerity to tell us that the Bible must be rescued from fundamentalists--the very ones who uphold all the truth claims of the Bible.
4,Human words cannot contain the deepest meaning of the Bible.,"Bishop Spong began his religious life as a Bible-studying fundamentalist. His earliest doubts about the inerrancy of the Bible as a literal document resulted not from the influence of the outside world, but from the Bible's intrinsic conflicts.Internal contradictions, pre-scientific assumptions, and pre-second-century social thought are all barriers to the modern Christian's literal acceptance of the Bible. Therefore Bishop Spong rightly employs them to underline his point that there must be a better way to understand Western civilization's most important book.RESCUING THE BIBLE FROM FUNDAMENTALISM is an earnest attempt to give thinking Christians a way to get beyond the humanly limited dimensions of the Bible, and into the inspired ones."
4,a case for informed bible study,"Spong writes persuasively, if a little cumbersome, for the view that reading the bible must not be based upon a clear and literal reading of english translations separated from the original texts by many translations and instances of ""filling in"" that were required when original texts were lost or damaged. Further, he highlights some of the contradictions and cultural traditions prevalent in biblical times that make literalism in regards to the bible seem ill informed at best and at worst mean spirited and/or manipulative of others. All in all, a good read if you have the faith to believe that the bible has a wonderful, true message to God's followers that does not require a literal reading of the Bible."
5,Informative and thought provoking - especially for those who have yet to formally study the Bible.,There was a time in my life when the notion that I would one day recommend a book by Bishop Spong would have filled me with incredulity. But that was before I studied for holy orders and long before my doctoral program at Sewanee (The School of Theology of The University of the South). I doubt that anyone who seriously considers the Bible and its relationship to faith in the modern world could fail to benefit from reading this book. This is especially true for those who have yet to seriously study it. I highly recommend this text!
4,Perhaps There is Hope After All,"I read this book at a time in my life where I was leaning heavily towards atheism, and pretty much considered people who were religious to be that way out of either fear or stupidity. Finally, here was a book that allowed me to be able to identify with religion. That helped me to connect and see that not ALL of the people who believe in religion think irrationally. That there is another group than the idiots trying to get ""creationism"" taught in our schools. I'm regaining spirituality in my life."
4,A Fellow Seeker,"I read this book because.... the title sounded interesting. Bishop Spong seems to have come from a similar background as myself. He has come to quite different conclusions than me though. He talks alot about not taking the bible literally. He also does a great job of analyzing the bible from the perspective and context of the writers. It makes you wonder why he takes ANY of the text seriously. Why not hinduism or buddhism or many other religions that espouse his doctrine of kindness and acceptance?His chapter on Paul was a little far reaching. I can think of many other explanations for Paul's torment. His theory is only one of many. Interesting, though. His opinion does seems to carry an agenda."
2,Read the History of the Christian Mind Control Barbarism,"I read this book when I was leaving the mind control system known as Christianity. I initially gave it 5 stars but have come back 2 years later and given it 2 as in the interim I have read a great deal about the barbaric history of the mind control system known as Christianity. It has been used as a tool of the plutocracy to produce serfs on earth by promising them pie in the sky. This is why it was invented. Currently the christian church is working as a fascist front here in the US and did so in the Hitler / Mussolini/ McCarthy era as well. Spong is to be commended for not being a part of the fascist / fundamentalist snake oil crowd, but he has to know the history of the charlatan outfit he is involved with (organized christianity) so I have minimal respect for him now."
1,EZEKIEL 13,"Mr. Spong has attempted to reduce God to base ""human terms."" His focus is on the creature and not the creator. God's wrath against sin is as secure a part of his character as is his love. You can NEVER seperate the two. Ezekiel 13 describes the false prophets who cry ""All is well!"" All is not well. Billions face a Christless eternity in hell. Spong provides a sliding board to begin the descent. Repent and believe in Jesus and thou shalt be saved. Do not follow Spong or any other like him. Follow Jesus!"
1,Inherit The Wind,"While Mr. Spong's reasoning is faulty, due to his belief in the myth of evolution, his conclusions grow even more distorted as he stumbles along in his own darkness. To those who think that evolution is based on facts, can you name ONE? Along with Denton, Behe, and Maxwell, Buckminster Fuller wrote that Darwiniam evolution is ""an illusion that debilitates elementary educatiom""."
2,What's the point of this book?,"If-as the author asserts-the Bible is not to be taken literally (that is: the existence of God; the resurrection of Jesus Christ; the reality of hell and the devil), what is the point of being a Christian?Or, why bother reading the Bible?"
4,Definite eye-opener..,"I myself am a Christian, and I found this book to be quite an eye-opener. The first 50 or more pages is filled with a lot of obvious literal conflicts within ""the Word"" itself, and I think that those whom try to fight this or take stand on this book without a --LOT-- of Biblical/Scholarly knowlege are on for quite a challenge. I do like his message about getting the feeling (and not the word-for-word translation) behind the Bible; this holds true for me. I had a difficult time at the latter half of the book. I would strongly reccomend this book for seminary students or priests, however for a common person like me, there is quite a bit of Scholarly discussion this last half of the book which makes it a bit sticky to follow. Definite eye opener. I think we should all keep open minds about these controversial issues. Spong does a good job of this, I think."
5,Rescuing the Bible,"This book is in very good condition - as stated. Also it arrived promptly. Was very, very happy with this entire process and product."
2,George,"After reading the book I'm a little confused about Bishop Spong, is he a christian or gnostic or Humanist Bishop? I believe he took a oath when he was ordained a priest and then later when he was made a bishop to defend the Christian faith. I really had a rough time figuring that out after reading his book. I guess he is articulating his conception of faith and hopefully he'll do better in future."
1,This Present Darkness,"The popularity of this book and other titles by Mr. Spong attests to the ignorance and spiritual blindness prevalent today. Here, the author comments extensively on Paul's epistles. On the (yahoo) search engine, enter"" martin luther romans"" to find his short commentary on Romans. There you will see the difference in understanding between an enlightened mind (Luther) and a deluded mind (Spong)."
1,Fundamentalism Starts With FUN!!!,"I found it interesting that a Gnostic has risen to become a bishop in The Episcopalian church. In choosing to claim that the Bible is not inerrant, the Bishop accuses the Bible of saying things that it does not say. The Bible never condones incest, slavery or polygamy. The Bible includes these stories so that we might see the consequences of foolish choices without having to make the choices ourselves. In claiming to rescue the Bible from fundamentalism Bishop Spong is doing a grave disservice to God, Christians and non Christians. I strongly recommend that anyone reading this book read 1at John as well, as 1st John refutes Bishop Spong's various theses."
3,So what now?,"Why bother with rescuing the Bible at all? After Spong rips into everything fundamentalists believe, what is left of Christianity as a religion? That is, if Jesus of Nazareth was nothing more than a sage (hyped into godhood by Paul, et.al), then he is no more important than any other great prophet. Once this is realized, Christianity as a religion is senseless--the message is to live the message, not to deify the messenger. But Spong seems to want to discredit the New Testament--and especially Paul--and then reconstruct Jesus into some sort of New Age superman. Why not let go?"
1,Ho-hum.,"Another country heard from in the ongoing series of harangues from theological liberals who somehow think we can arrive at the ""true essence"" of something by not being ""literalistic"" about it. Don't these pop mystics ever wonder why the Bible is a _book_ (rather than, say, a painting) if we're not supposed to understand it ""literally?"" What do they think words are _for_?If you don't believe the Bible, then you don't believe the Bible. Fine; just say so honestly. Don't indulge in this irrational nonsense about how you've stopped being ""narrowly literalistic"" and thereby restored what Christianity is ""truly"" about. Taking words ""nonliterally"" is merely a path to confusion.And be as (pseudo-) ""scholarly"" about the Bible as you like. But if you think (as Episcopalian-Church-salaried ""Bishop"" Spong seems to think) that you can do so _while being a Christian_ . . . think again."
1,Let's rescue the Bible from John Shelby Spong,"Similar thought processes as presented within this work have made the Catholic Church what it is this day. It is a Christian religion that is based very much upon the traditions of men rather than the statements of God (like the Jews of Jesus' day). Spong relys on the knowledge and wisdom of mankind to nay say the inerrant word of his God.The same way of thinking is what got ""us"" kicked out of the garden, toppled the tower of bable, destroyed the world once, wiped out two cities, and scattered ""God's"" people across the planet. We should of course be careful of our intrepretation of God's word. Our misuse of His word has caused too many problems (I wonder why?) Mabey, we should rely on His Holy Spirit for guidance and be wary of the guidance of familiar spirits in matters concerning the Holy Word of God."
5,Insightful and moving,"In a clear writing style, Spong exposes the fundamentalist, mindlessly literal movement in Christianity as simply foolish, and returns our attention to the message of the Word of God rather than the words themselves. Reading this book has been insightful, and made me proud to be a Christian. No doubt that folks who like to pretend that the Bible is perfectly correct in every phase, often those same folks who have justified slavery, segregation, the inferiority of women, and many our society's ills using the words of the Bible, will find Spong's ideas threatening. For me, it deeped my understanding of God and faith."
5,Opened a Door,"Reading this book has allowed me, a long time atheist, to reconsider the church I was brought up in and which I left due to unreconcilable conflicts between a literal Bible and the facts of scientific discovery. I had heard others talk about the Bible as ""symbolism"" but never in a way that made those symbols both accessible as parable and profound as statements of faith.Regardless of attacks from conservative and fundamentalist Christians, this book does nothing to belittle or reject Jesus Christ. Bishop Spong's work allows one to see beyond the human frailty of the authors of the Gospel and to connect directly with the profound love and power that must have walked the earth to inspire such stories.I recommend this book to anyone who thinks that the Bible is wrong just because it is told from a paradigm we no longer accept."
1,Don't bother with this one,"This book, while equipt with nice photos is not worth buying. The book is poorly written and contains little information that is particular to the breed (other than a repeated insistance that the dog owner must remember that the 15 pound puppy will soon turn into a 130 lb dog). It is a book about dogs (only ""newfie is substituted for dog). For instance -- in the excercize chapter: it says something like ""Jogging is good exercize for you and your newfie""... Duh."
1,zkatrina1017,"I agree with the others who were dissapointed by this book. If you know anything about giant dog breeds, then reading this book will add little to no information. There aren't many breed-specific facts about the Newfoundland, and the facts that are there are very general and could apply to any giant dog. I will keep looking for better sources."
4,Love this book!,"From the cover to the last page on this book it is filled with gorgeous pictures and great material on this magnificent breed. The information contained within the book is worth the buy, but the pictures is what keeps you coming back for another look."
4,Small but informative,"I bought this book at the recommendation of a Newfoundland breeder. It is small, but quite informative and not a fill-in-the-blank dog book that is really about any dog.Linda Morgan"
3,It is just okay.,Sometimes the sewer lids get jammed. The lids can be very easy to lose. But it can move around fast if you push it. There is a chair that comes with it so one of the TMNT's can sit inside and blast the lids out.There are places on the side to put some weapons if you have some. I probably would not get it if I was given another choice.
2,Disappointed,My son received this toy for his birthday and it only worked for about an hour. The lids kept getting stuck and jamming the launcher and then it stopped working altogether. We even tried new batteries and nothing. We are returning it.
4,sewer lid launcher....,this vehicle is great the only reason it comes apart easily is because the batteries are under the big part of it and it HAS to come off or else what if you have to change the batteries and it won't come off that's why it falls apart easily!!!!!
3,not exactly as pictured,"both earrings are not exactly as rich in color as in the pictures.there was no garnet in mine at all. they were smaller than i thought they would be. overall, not really impressive."
3,It is OK.,"Ok, this is album is good. But not as great as the previous cds in this Billboard top dance hit series.There are no Disco Divas here. I liked ""Megatron Man"" and ""Right on Target"". Some songs were just mediocre, there must have been better songs released that year."
4,I hope they're as good as I heard,"I just got my this capsules. I heard so many things from this Maca Capsules from helping with fertility to butt enhancer . I'll start using them tomorrow, soon I'll update to see did it go."
5,Banks Exhaust for a 2005 Nissan Titan,"Banks Exhaust changed my girlie truck to one mean sounding BITCH. Had two problems: one was getting the bolts out the old system. WOW! The other was the exhaust hangers provided by Banks. Two stripped out before getting to the recommended torque. Other than that, system is a perfect match."
4,Banks 48120 Exhaust system,"Like all the other reviews state, this exhaust is extremely easy to install and the deep throaty sound is amazing. I haven't driven my Titan enough to determine whether or not the gas milage as increased but the power is most definitely there. I looked at all the other exhaust systems on the market and Banks was the least expensive and they also offered the best performance results."
2,Good - In A Way,"As someone very interested in American History, I was anxious to read this book to get a different perspective on the events that shaped our country's future.It's an interesting account but tends to ramble at times. Most of the writing is fairly dry. The author either skims over details or spends way too much time on them.A nice little refresher if you forgot what college reading was like."
4,Works as advertised,"I purchased these drill its to make 1/2"" holes in glass bricks & bottles so that my wife could put small Christmas lights inside as a holiday decoration. They work well but since there is no centering bit it would be very difficult to start a hole with a hand drill. fortunately I had access to a portable drill press so they worked quite easily. As a caveat, you should go slow with a minimum of pressure and be sure to use water to cool and lubricate as you drill."
2,"Cant Love it, but its ok...","Frankly, its diamond coating is not nearly satisfying,its FAR less than the photo, to the point of sad. I have not used it, and frankly I sincerely doubt it will last even with proper light work for it, although I bought it with higher hopes being the metal bits. AND THATS USING IT WITH COOL OIL CONTINUOUS FLOW, as all Diamond tools should be used for longer lifespan of the tool. So now.. Not all that great, but it will suffice once or twice. Not likely to ever buy again, either the brand and especially not this product, the difference of product from photo to realistic was an average of less than 10% tool coating with any dust at all. Not happy but thats life I guess."
4,Diamond Dust Hole Saws,"Great product for a good price. No problem drilling through tile. The smaller sizes (e.g., 1/4"", 5/16"", & 3/8"") do not have any means of clearing the flute of debris, whereas other hole saws have openings for just such a purpose. This is the only reason I rate this product a 4 rather than 5; otherwise, a great product that I'd recommend to anyone who needs to drill through ceramic tile."
2,WORKS REALLY WELL..... one time only.....,"When I purchased these, the immediate need was to drill holes in several ceramic vases that my girlfriend had purchased. I used the smallest bit in my Dremel.... and it holed that vase like a hot knife through.. something that is slightly easier to cut when the knife is hot. Butter?Anywaays.... Long story short: second hole... not so easy. Why? Because the first hole took ever piece of grit from the cutting surface. What does that mean? That means i can no longer put holes in things at a 5/16"" size.If you want to pay a lot for a disposable one time use hole drill bit... then these are for YOU!If you want to pay a lot for something that you will have for years, or even days.. then look elsewhere.Super disappointed"
5,A Winner,"In his first case after Shackles, ""Nameless"" is hired to find out why a young man who won $200,000 at a Reno slot machine would commit suicide.With his usual masterly touch, Pronzini has given us an inventive story of overcoming one's past and the effect of greed. The mystery really takes second place in the story and it's a little weak. But the look at ""Nameless"" still recovering from being held captive and at Eberhardt overcoming past relationships were enough to keep me reading. It's also nice to see a character that deals realistically with his age--he's not young, but he's still tough. This is a short, quick read, but imminently satisfying."
1,Disappointing,"I hoped to find fresh new action ideas for reducing impact on the natural resources, plant and animal species and their habitats. The most important issue was not emphasized: Planet Earth's urgent need for humans to embrace 1-2-child families in preference to larger ones worldwide. Such a worthy behavior change would validate use of the immense U.S.public relations and promotional skills."
1,ZERO I rate htis item as A zero - DONT BUY IT!!!,"thIs arrived dented and completely incapable of assembly. I had my three 300 lb football player friends each take a shot at alinging the bars to the wagon and it's such a poor cut that none of them were able to actually screw in the ""simple"" screws. DISASTER!! COMPANY SHOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS!"
1,Bad smell,The color was off. It was more like peach colored and the lipstick had a horrible smell like a lipstick that was expired.
2,Nice color but old stock,"I gave this two stars for the timely delivery and packaging. However, this lipstick from estee lauder was old stock. I own other EL lippys but this one definitly smelt like cosmetic way past its prime. Not worth $$ returning. threw this out. Sad, nice color."
2,Can we get it moving?,Very slow read. Took me days to finish. All in all I don't think he writes well from women's point of view.
4,Good Read,"Reesa wants a baby before she turns 35.Carmen is unsure of her current relationship and Erica is carrying around pain and resentment from a previous relationship that ended 2 years ago and all of a sudden he pops back up into her life.After reading this book,I think that some women will be able to relate to the characters in this book dealing with the men they love."
3,Never write from a woman's perspective again,"I LOVED The Choices Men Make and The Womanizers... Dwayne lost his touch with Never Say Never while it was mislabeled as a ""follow-up"" to The Womanizers. It was like Never Say Never was written before...but much better. How many books are already out there about sista-friends going through relationship drama while having each other's back?? Too many! The edgy and sometimes gripping storylines that I've read in Dwayne's past books were definitely missing here. The characters were weak and judgmental. Mike's cameo was cut too short and I really wasn't sure what Ahmad and Shay's place in the book was to begin with. A twist should have been added to one of the chapters. The ""happily ever after, everything is now okay"" ending just didn't sit right with me. It was like everyone changed their minds and altered their personalities.Nothing surprising at all.Dwayne, you do a much better job when ""the fellas"" are your protagonists so why not bring it back?"
2,TOO SLOW,THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY SLOW FOR ME... WHEN I STARTED READING I WAS EXCITED BUT IT BORED ME.... IT COULD BE THE FACT THAT YOU WROTE FROM A WOMANS PERSEPECTIVE... BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME...
3,"""Whew! Finished It!""","I usually enjoy the works of Mr. Joseph, but this one is not so good. All three women got on my nerves, and the plot was painfully slow. Of the three women, Erica worked my nerves the most, Reesa and Carmen did ya need a man THAT bad?"
2,Never Say Never.....it was not a page turner,This book could not keep my interest. I think it just had a lot of typical things that women want and go through with some drama. It was okay....just not the intense page turning book I was looking for.Renaissance Bookclub
2,OK,"I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT ""NEVER SAY NEVER"" KEPT MY INTEREST. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A FAST READ THEN GET THIS BOOK. THE STORY WAS GOOD BUT TYPICAL THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THE BOOK THAT WAS DIFFERENT OR UNEXPECTED."
4,Yummy1,"The coarsly ground pepper and dry cured salami are a great combination. Tastes great, but price was a draw back. What you pay for the Salami in addition to the shipping makes the purcase difficult to justify, unless money is just not a concern."
3,Very tasty for people who LOVE black pepper,"This is a good salami, especially as part of an antipasto. I slice this and serve it with mozzarella, stuffed green olives, and sliced plum tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It's a great hit and the heavy pepper matches well with the more subtle mozzarella."
1,This book is a real stinker,"Even if the writing weren't clunky (and it is), you would have a hard time getting past the knuckleheaded twerp of a narrator. His life is four parts confusion and one part anger. When he's not pathologically befuddled by life going on around him, he's pontificating and asking all sorts of pseudo-rhetorical questions about *the* gay life. In one particularly grotesque scene, the narrator, his delirious, gravely ill lover, and the lover's doctor return home from a movie. The lover soils himself on the way up to the apartment, the other two undress him and themselves, and they all get in the shower. The narrator then proceeds to spank the doctor's monkey. Yeech! I realized that reading this book is the equivalent of watching an Ed Wood film: it is so bad that it transfixes the viewer (or reader). You've been warned."
1,avoid,Check out the vi search and replace commands they use. The examples. Try using them on Solaris. Notice how they don't work & are completely wrong?
4,Well worth the money,"These little figures were a godsend to us on our trip oversees. My daughter loves Jojo. The the only thing is that they come on a board that is magnetic but half of the figures are too top heavy to stay on it. So my daughter doesn't use the board all that much. However, she plays with them a lot."
3,JoJo's Circus Magic Circus Friends Pack,"Unfortunatly, JoJo's let broke off on the second day and the characters have a difficult time all fiting on the base."
3,SUPER GLUE TO THE RESCUE,"These dolls are adorable! And fun to play with. But, as with so many other reviewers, JoJo's legs fell off after a day of play. We used a dab of ""super glue"" to fit her back together, and she has been a trooper ever since! She has repeatedly withstood my son's attempts to dismember her... as he was a bit amused by it the first time. And, even with the glue, JoJo's legs are still very pliable... just they don't fall off anymore. :o)"
2,Jojo's Arm Fell Off!,"At first I thought these toys were wonderful! My daughter loved to play with them and would role play all day long. They are great for in the car because they are small and portable. She also loved to stick them on the fridge because of the magnetic feet. However, within a week of playing with Jojo the arm fell off. It is very small and I had to take it away. I thought it was just a bad thing, but we had another Jojo from the house set and the exact same arm fell off. My daughter still loves the set and doesn't seem to notice the arm fell off, just watch out for choking hazards."
2,Not durable,"My daughter loves Jojo, and loved these figurines. Unfortunately, Jojo's leg broke off in the first week. Then Croaky's head AND legs came off. Too bad."
1,weird fabric,I feel like these are a knock off hard tail. The fabric is too thick and the color is not attractive
5,a masterpiece for the beginner to the artisan,This book is a culinary tour de force that features a variety of tastes that will whet anyone's pallet! A must read as well as a must use. I highly recommend this book to anyone whose interest reach beyond the den of their house. Enjoy-I did!
5,review,"Great collection!!! A must-read! This collection focuses on the Gothic tradition of horror... harkens back to the true masters such as Poe, Stoker, and Polidori!"
5,"Leading us into the world of silence, highly recommended","As a hearing person, it is hard for me to acquire an accurate picture of the deaf world as even my hearing impaired buddies can't tell much of the difference given their early loss of hearing and my limited understanding of sign language (they are somehow forced to sign more simply to express themselves in front of me). With a complete loss of hearing at the age of seven but mastery of English, the author can vividly depict how he 'sees' voices and sounds as well as what really exists in his world of silence. What's more, I truly admire his candid self-examination, such as the white superiority in South Africa in his times. It is racist in nowadays standard, but being truthful to oneself is far more precious than being politically correct to me. Highly recommend it to those who are interested in the issue of deafness."
3,Good Value for the price.,"Ordered this stand and received it fairly quickly, 2 business days. Sturdy, came with decent directions.For those considering this stand:It says ""Item Weight: 20 pounds"",and shipping weight of 40 some pounds.******THE BOX SAYS THE STAND WEIGHS 36 POUNDS, NOT THE 20 LIKE IN THE DESCRIPTION*******I weighed the stand without the bodyharness and it was 29 pounds, not the 20 or 36 like it said on here and on the box.***The DVD could not be read in my Blu-ray/DVD player, xbox360, or 1 year old laptop.**Also, the cable that goes around the tree is hard to line up in the holes, I will probably get some roller chain instead.*I had to drill out a few of the holes where the bolts go through because I couldn't get them to line up."
3,My first climber,"This is my first climber.Pros:cheap, durable, & safeCons:The cables are often difficult to shove far into the metal frame for smaller trees.You have to remove the arm pads every time you want to put the thing on a tree.According to a hunter friend of mine, the harness is terribleMy friend recommends spending another $100 or $150 for a better stand. Did I mention I'm cheap? So far so good this season with the stand, but one thing of note is I did spend another $150 on a harness kit from Quick Climb and I do feel safer as I agree about the included harness with this stand."
2,not what I expected,"I recomend spending another $100.00 to get a better stand, its hard to keep your feet in the straps while climbing,the middle of the bootstrap broke the first time I used it,Its not a very comfortable stand either , the shooting rail is to low , im 6'2 and its at my knees, I DO NOT recomend this product"
3,Just Okay Climber stand for the price,"This climber stand works well and is pretty good for the price. Its heavier than the specifications suggest on the product detail page. Its also pretty cumbersome when trying to attach the two together for backpacking in and out. I ended up using a couple bungee cords to make this easier. Because this is mainly made of hollow steel, its pretty loud while setting up. If you're taking it in and out with you daily, its not the most quite thing to set up. Also, the boot straps are difficult to get on while up in the stand, it takes some practice. Requires the straps over the toes and then a bungee (provided) around the heels. The buckles on those straps are pretty weak too, and are already bent slightly after a couple uses. I sort of wish I would have shopped around some more and did more research. I will likely be selling this after this hunting season and looking for a better quality stand next year."
2,"Heavy Climber, old school style","The climber came in beat up box and and upon immediate pick up, I knew the weight was questionable. The climber set-up is a style most newer tree climbers have gone away. I wish there were more detailed pictures of the set-up of the tree stand. Those picture would have prevented me from purchasing it."
4,Nice Balls,Just like the prose use in the video. Pump is cheap but effective...a workout in itself. Wife loves this ball. Thsi size good for shorter people.
2,junky pump,"Stamina Crystal Edge Premium Exercise Ball (65 cm)I bought this eight months ago for $25.10. It was difficult to pump up with the very flimsy pump they include, but I finally achieved it with great effort. After eight months, noting a slight loss of pressure, I tried to refill it with the pump, but a crack has developed in the very cheap plastic hose, so that it is now not just difficult, but impossible to refill. If I can't find a convenient alternative method of refilling it, I will return the product. It turns out that the pump is an important component of the ball."
5,A great read for skaters and non skaters alike of all ages who want to learn about the history of the sport,"As someone who grew up skateboarding ""back in the day"" in Florida, and who is now back at it again as a middle aged father, it was great to read the history of someone who came up through the ranks as a young skater and is still killing it today. No matter whether you are an East or West Coast skater, if you want to enjoy a true story from a guy who has seen it all this is a must read!"
2,Too scary for my small children,"Love most of this series, but not this one. My kids found it way too scary. There is a fire spitting spider in it that made my 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter cry. Might be fine for older kids or kids that aren't bothered by scary things."
4,LOVE it.,"Oh man, if you appreciate Peter Andre and can't get enough of ""Mysterious Girl"", I don't know how you can resist this single. I'll admit, I was a bit embarrassed to buy it, but I can't lie: I've been listening to this thing non-stop. The Jupiter Soul Mix sucks, which is why Peter didn't get all five stars, but come on, guys. If you're addicted to the good version of ""Mysterious Girl"", this will get you your fix. I'm thankful every day that ""I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here"" aired so that we could all enjoy this resurgence of the one and only Peter Andre. ""Insania"" is the price we paid, I suppose..."
5,Everyone should listen to Pato Banton,For if everyone listened to Pato the world would be a much better place. Having seen Pato banton live on numerous occasions this DVD manages to capture the essence of his beautiful spirit. I urge everyone to catch a Pato Banton show- but if you cannot- please watch this DVD.Go Pato!
5,nice pan!,"Received this pan today anticipating making chicken parmesan. Got a REALLY good deal from amazon warehouse! Love the pan! But, the bottom of the Pan's diameter is only 9 inches so I only got to pan fry my chicken in 2 batches and had to finish in another larger pan. It was super easy to clean!"
3,Not as good as I thought,"This is a very large sauce pan, more than adequate for our needs. It browns meats well and is excellent for saute... however, after just a few uses it shows ""scuff marks"" on the sides and bottoms. Not scratches, as I am very careful with the utensils I use... only plastic, never metal. It has a warranty but a very generic one (for manufacturers defects only). Just hope these ""scuff marks"" do not escalate."
5,Go-to pot.,"We were given this as a wedding gift 3 years ago. It was an off-registry gift, but has become our favorite hands-down. I find myself using it every other day. It has become my go-to pot for most main stove-top dishes. 3 years in, it has only 1 or 2 superficial scratches and the non-stick finish is still going strong. At this price, I plan to purchase a few for my sisters."
5,"Once we got this pan, we really stopped using the others.","I got this pan as a wedding gift three years ago and have used it almost exclusively for all of my cooking since. Everyone in my family uses this pan for its great non-stick, even heating, and perfect shape. I highly recommend this pan to everyone."
2,Not worth the $$$,"My son LOVED LOVED LOVED this airplane.That being said, within days, the nuts fall off. His steering wheel comes off daily, and I have to rebolt it on.A tire broke within a month, and we had to order a replacement from the store we bought it from. And the manufacturer charged us for the new tire (according to the store).The propeller doesn't turn properly.Over all, just very disappointed in the mechanics.Just not worth the $$$ for all the labor involved."
2,Sick of cheap junk!,"We have been trying to get our grandson - who LOVES airplanes - a ride on plane for 2 months now. We decided to go with the metal pedal plane thinking it would be better quality than the battery powered one we ordered twice. Well guess what....this box comes half open, bolts are missing, one of the snaps holding the leather around the seat is off, the leather looks worn and the metal just looks cheap. I'm sure my grandson will love it just because it's a plane he can ride in but for $300 I do expect something in brand new condition with all the parts present!! We considered sending it back to get a new one but we've done that twice now and the poor kid keeps asking where his plane is! Amazon should screen companies better - I'm not sure I'll be ordering from Amazon again."
3,Immigration review,"Good book, but almost no help with the appeal process. Should tell you how to appeal, who to talk to to do it, do you need a lawyer etc? But almost nothing about that very important area. Also nothing on how to request a deportation hearing, and/or what to say/do when you are in it."
4,"good, basic overview of immigration and naturalization law","This book provides a good, solid overview of immigration law. It is not an overly-detailed guide that addresses every possible nuance of immigration law. Rather, it discusses the basics, the terminology, the myriad avenues through which which a foreigner can gain legal residence in the US. This book would be a good starting point for someone wishing to immigrate to the United States, for an alien residing in the US who wishes to become a US citizen, or for an employer seeking to bring immigrants into its work force. There are many anecdotal examples, which make the book easy to read. This book may not answer all of your questions within its pages, but it will give you enough background information so that you know how to ask the right targeted questions of the INS or an immigration lawyer."
4,Informative and easy to read,"This 2nd edition would appear to reflect INS rule and fee changes in the last couple of years. The book covers all facets of immigrating to the United States from the different categories of VISAs to Permanent Residence and Naturalization. It is somewhat like a condensed version of INS law written in plain English. For clarity, the author backs up every major point pertaining to a given aspect of immigration/naturalization procedures and rules with a real-life example. The less one knows about immigration/naturalization laws, the more helpful this book will be. Conversely, if one is familiar with INS procedures and is looking for specific information above and beyond the basics, chances are it won't be found here. However, the book contains a section listing many helpful websites covering immigration law and policy."
5,Concise and indispensable,Help with one of the most complex issues many people have in dealing with our government is always needed. When that help comes from a well respected source in an easy to follow style it is a godsend. I can't even explain how many hours this book saved me.
3,Addendum to my Earlier Review,Upon Further review and written clarification by the Author himself (I appreciate the letter from the Author) I found that the information for N-400 is correct on Page 130.Overall I think the Author has made a genuine effort to put together valuable information to be used by any person without a Lawyer's help.
2,"Useful for Basic Information, but not Current with Fees","I bought this book to obtain more information than what is generally available on the Internet. Though It covered all the basic information, the author has not bothered to keep it current. e.g. The current cost of an Naturalization is $225.00 + $25.00 for finger printing not $95.00 as stated in the form printed in the book. Which means that the forms printed in the book are out of date. Also information given about finger printing process is totally wrong.Overall I was very dissappointed with this book. Author has the potential to come up with a revised edition that not only carries current information but also has a section for all the fees and finger printing process."
4,"Little-known, valuable work","Without having read through this unfortunately very expensive 2-vol work, I would judge -- based on samplings -- that it provides invaluable information. To give one example, the article dealing with translations of Goethe's works into English would be extremely useful to a teacher of comparative literature who is not familiar with the various translations of Goethe, in particular of his Faust, a work which, as Luke (a translator) points out, must preserve the end rhyme where it is present in the original. This book should be in every scholarly library."
5,"Wonderful fusion of fantacy, science and historical fact","This is a delightful book having warm illustrations and a story line merging fantasy (talking animals with soaring dreams)with an actual historical account. I hope this books helps to inspire my little girl to follow her dreams and an appreciation of science and history. To round out the experience and add some hands on fun, I suggest purchase of the 5 foot flying replica of the Montgolfier brothers balloon from the Exploratorium store on line."
5,Exceptional Children's Book !!!,"""Mouton's Impossible Dream"" is delightful, well-written, beautifully illustrated children's book. The spectacular water color pictures in this book bring the imaginative characters to life in this charming, heart warming story. Not only does it tell this historical story acurately, but it gives it a life of it's own that leaves children asking for it over and over. My 3 children adore this book, and have requested we give it as gifts to several of their friends. Anik McGrory is a refreshing artist that we will look for again and again. Fantastic!!!"
4,A great gift for ANY parent... from baby #1 to #10!!,"My husband and I bought this product for our children (ages 1 & 2) and it is a life saver. I keep all the meds they need in there that way I know where to find it when the time comes! Its convienent and small enough to pack to go on vacation with and has a fairly durable case.I would recommend it to ANY parent, just wish they'd make it a little more toddler proof."
2,You can do better on your own,"All the medicines included are in small ""sample sizes"" and the case breaks easy (ours was broken when we bought it, but we didn't notice). My recommendation pick one up at a store and walk around and buy the real useful sizes of everything in it then put this kit back. I'll bet you'll spend only a few dollars more and have some real supplies to get you started. This feels more like a J+J ad kit than a product."
1,Beware!!!,"This is not a book - at best it is the notes for an article repscrambled, repeated and recycled to fill the space between the covers. The best I can say is that although I felt stupid for having bought it in the first place, I get some satisfaction from knowing that the two men who put their names on the cover have distinguished themselves as complete dolts!"
2,Bad logic,This book is an interesting read as long as you realize that the Writer is extremely biased and rather prejudiced. The Author makes many illogical leaps and then uses those unfounded decisions as further proof that their points are valid.It has an extremely christian bias and if the beliefs do not conform to traditional catholic dogma then they are dismissed as wrong. The author even goes into the Church using Cabala but never lumps it into the midden heap every other Cabalistic practitioner is lumped into.This book should be used in logic classes as an example of bad A priori arguments taken to bad extremes.Given that I read the entire book and had several good chuckles at the attempts to link everything into one continuing chain of hidden knowledge.
1,Outdated and opinionated,"A book of this nature, nearly 90-years old, begs critical analysis. The fact that anyone swallows Webster's beliefs shows a prejudice already in place. Most of her sources show a lack of academic rigor or extremely biased interpretations. So much material has been discovered since she wrote, so many researchers, thinkers and history have passed judgement on this kind of thinking that to even consider her more than a blip on the screen of opinion boggles the mind. This book holds a place primarily with bigots, racists, anti-Semites and white supremacists, others should be strongly cautioned."
2,Its the Jews-again.,"I read this book and in just about every chapter the author turns back to the influence of the Jew and the Kabbalah. Quite frankly I got tired of it. She subtlely defends Jesuitism and makes the Jews the conspirators of all sorts of secret societies and world revolutions. Reminds me of the Protocols of Zion and the falsifications that are found there. The best way to throw someone off your trail is to write something in someone else's name. I felt the same way about this book. On the positive, it has good historical information, but again-its always the Jews. Enough said."
5,Excellent book to read,This was a very inspirational book. I believe it is good for all ages. It teaches us how to live an exceptional life.
4,Great 80's Ballad Music,"If you are like I am and a huge fan of the 80's music era, then you will love this CD packed full of slow love songs from this generation. A must have collection..."
3,Okay,I've been reading Andrew Greeley's books for years. It's starting to feel like I'm reading the same book over and over again.
3,Soap opera.,"If I'm not mistaken, this is Greeley's first novel. Many others followed. I don't believe that success was due to any particularly redeeming features of this book -- it's little more than a soap opera. More likely, the public found it titillating that a priest would write fiction that included sex scenes and other ""shocking"" material. If Greeley were not a priest, I don't think anyone would have paid attention to this book (and there probably wouldn't have been any others from his pen published)."
1,Torture.,"This is the first, and only book I have read by Andrew Greely. I only finished the book because I thought it had to get better and I always try to finish a book I have started. The characters were shallow, the plot predictable. I never was able to relate to Pat or Kevin in any way and by the end of the book was happy to be rid of them."
2,The Cardinal Snooze!,"I found this book in the free book bin at work, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. The beginning and middle were okay, and I kept reading in hopes that the plot would pick up. It didn't -- and, in fact, got WORSE! Greeley began introducing more and more characters, all with similar (and hard to pronounce) names. The plot was jumpy, and I found myself skipping the ""really boring"" parts about the papal election to get to the ""just plain boring"" parts about the other characters. And the end, WHAT END? Nothing was resolved! Not that I minded. By the end of this 500+ pager, I was ready to call it quits no matter what happened! The only good thing about this book, in my opinion, is that I didn't pay for it. I think I'll put it back in the free book bin where I found it and let another poor sap suffer!"
3,Ho hum,"This novel is OK but not wildly exciting. The plot is well constructed and well written but nothing partcularly exciting happens and there is little suspense. The character development is somewhat humdrum. I found that I didn't really care what happened to the lead characters, which is a bad sign."
4,Feels just like being on a ship,"I was a little leary of this book since I find a lot of ""Space Navy"" stories rather overdone. However, from the first page, I felt like I was back on a ship and was reliving my own first tour on a ship."
3,Nothing Special,"Read this after reading The Lost Fleet and enjoying that quite a bit. Unfortunately, like Stark's War, it seems like it took Hemry a few books to really get the hang of things. In this one, the characters weren't all that well developed, plot was essentially straightforward, and the big ethical dilemma was pretty contrived. All in all, barely as good as a mediocre David Weber."
4,An excellent introduction to the Old Testament,"This book offers a wonderful introduction to the lessons of the Old Testament. It avoids missing the forest for the trees, while still giving specific biblical stories, and it never loses sight of the Old Testament's relevance to the modern world. The book takes a semi-chronological look at the books of the Old Testament, hilighting stories and lessons of particular interest. A wonderful way to come to the Bible for the first time, or to gain a greater understanding of it."
4,Very Intersting,This book is the best kept secret. Mr. Jarvis really knows what he is doing. Keep up the great job Frank!
5,Excellent,"This item is excellent for any use around the house and shop. I use it to clean windows and my wife uses it to clean the stove top. It stores extra blades in the handle too. My old scraper could never hold the blade strong enough to scrape old gaskets off, but this one works perfect. I actually ordered 2 more for family."
5,Tedd Joselson plays Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff,"This is a superb disc that would be easy to overlook. Tedd Joselson plays the Prokofiev as well as anyone I've ever heard - and that is saying something, given the number of great pianists who have tackled this wonderful piece. His performance is full of subtle, witty touches. The Paganini Rhapsody is slightly less compelling, but it is excellent in its own more straightforward way. Orchestral accompaniment if good, though less distinctive than Joselson's pianism. Superb recorded sound."
3,"Good ""old-timer"" building book","Although this book was quite informative it was not what I was looking for as it is lacking the tecnological side of building barns, sheds etc. It is written with reference to a previous time period--I did not find this book very useful for today's building and planning of such structures."
2,Product has short comings.,"Like the coating not lasting long enough on lens? I guess it worked for a day. Example; this past summer I applied anti-fog to my sunglasses on Friday and by Sunday... a humid day, leaving home and walking to my car, my expensive Maui Jim sunglasses fogged up so bad, I had to take them off to see my car. I consider this just a high priced lens cleaner, nothing special."
5,Incredible Everything!,"This man's voice is out of this world. I first came to know of Mr. Hernandez years ago when he first took the role of Javert on Broadway in Les Miserables, and I was floored. INFINATE acting talent! When I heard he had this solo CD out, I went to buy it while I was in New York. Amazing, amazing, amazing! His range is astounding, his passion and the way he puts these words across - absolutely wonderful! I have nothing but praise to say about his work, and his God-given talent. I recommend this music to anyone who can't resist an exciting beat, and also the lush tones of a romantic love song, all with the Latin flare. If you ever have an opportunity to hear this music, or see him perform on stage, leap on the opportunity with both feet! He's spectacular!"
3,Maru,The lilies are very beautiful however the picture shows something entirely different from what bloomed! They were the correct color but a different shape. They came up looking like my Maru lilies that I have instead of the picture that was shown.
3,Great coffee poor electronics,"I have had 3 of these makers. They make the best coffee i've had out of a drip type unit hands down. But they will only last about a year then the electronic board that controls everything will start to fail. At first it will shut off in the middle of brewing, you would then hit the ON button and it will finish, but eventually it will totally fail. If they would just fix that problem it would be a fantastic brewer."
4,GREAT TASTING COFFEE,"This is without a doubt the best coffee maker you can buy for under a hundred bucks. This machine brews at the PROPER 200F. Most consumer drip coffee makers brew at a considerably lower temp, which means the extraction of the flavor from the beans is incomplete and the coffee doesn't taste nearly as good.There ARE reliability and design issues with this machine. If you want a better machine that brews at the proper temp, your only option is the $~250 Technivorm..."
2,"Good coffee, flimsy design","This brewed a great pot of coffee, but the clock/timer/switch which are cheap and all interconnected died after a year of use."
2,Great for a Little While,"This coffee maker is capable of making what is probably the best cup of coffee I have ever had. I am 66 and have drank an ocean full of coffee in my life time. It gets the water hot enough to do what the water is suppose to do to coffee, extract the flavor. This coffee was actually so good that I contemplated buying another to have as a spare if this one quit.This fond affection lasted only for a short time. I have had this coffee maker for about 4-6 weeks. Gradually, the coffee started to taste a little strange, like plastic. It even smells like plastic. Now it is undrinkable.The other problem is that the carafe needs a serious redesign. It is practically impossible to clean and you will spill coffee all over your counter until you program yourself on how to pour the coffee. If the other problem did not exist, I would still recommend this coffee maker."
1,Presto Scandinavian Design Coffee Maker- NO GOOD!!,"This had all the ""bells and Whistles"", and I was looking for a great cup of joe- NOT!I grind my own YUMMY gormet beans with a ""good"" conical burr grinder (my mid-priced grinder, that rivals/surpasses the very expensives models is the- Capresso Infinity Conical Burr Coffee Grinder! Very even grind! That's another review!)No matter what I did, I got ""WEAK"" ""TASTELESS!"" coffee?I even tried 3 tablespoons of med-grind coffee, per cup (doubled)- Still weak & tasteless!I figured out what the problem is!-The instructions claim it is ""VERY FAST""! 10 cups in 8 minutes- TRUE!That is where the problem lies-The hot water goes through so fast that it doesn't have a chance to pull the flavor out of the grounds!Back to my EXCELLENT Braun KF-400 (another review)."
3,"Nice, But Low On Content","""Standing With Stones"" is a two-hour video tour of over one hundred (!) megalithic sites in Great Britain. It's great to visit so many spots at once, but the downside is that very little time can be spent at any given place. Even Stonehenge is given only a very short scene in the video. The film's writer (and on-camera host) is an enthusiast, not an expert; there isn't much interpretation and analysis, nor even many facts, to be had on this video. (It is useful, though, to be reminded how little we really know about these ancient places). The photography is quite well done, and adds measurably to one's enjoyment of the DVD.To summarize, this is a pleasant video that will appeal to people who would like a brief tour of (lots of) British megalithic sites. However, viewers who want more details about these places are likely to come away disappointed."
5,Great documentary,"So I rented this through my Netflix subscription, and like it so much I had to buy it!!! The presenter goes from the south of England (Cornwall) to the very tip of Scotland, and even goes through out Ireland, and looks at a lot of the neolithic sights from standing stones to chamber tombs. If your like me and find the Neolithic history of the British Isle then this is the the documentary that you should get for your library."
5,standing with stones,this is a great movie. you get to see so many differnt prehistoric rock creations.it showed so many ones i had never heard of.i loved seeing the buildings they showed and went inside.one actualy had a pethrafide tree in it.this is a wonderful dvd it shows you so many differnt things and tells you so much you didnt know about.it is a must see
3,OK...,"Somewhat interesting, but you REALLY have to be into this subject matter to find it interesting...he basically drives from site to site discussing what may or may not have happened there...after about an hour and ten minutes, I yawned and shut it off. Perhaps I lack the right anthropology/archeology gene, but ultimately I found this DVD boring."
1,Cheap Junk,"I carried the Dynaplug around in my car for 2 years before I needed to use it.When I got a flat today and I was attempting to push the plug into the hole inthe tire, the metal stem on the tool just folded over and bent 90 degrees. Itwas then completely broken and useless. Do not waste your money on thischeaply made trash."
1,Call a Tow Truck,There is not much to say about this product except JUNK save your money and purchase an old fashion garage type plug kit at Wal-Mart. I had purchased two kits for different cars and broke both. It's also fun trying to thread the hot and sticky tar type plugs into the handle on the side of the road. Don't buy it.
1,"Temporary, Had to buy a new","I usually don't write reviews, but this product let me down. I noticed a nail in one of my sumitomo tires. I wanted to save some time so I bought this kit thinking it would work like a charm. It had gotten great reviews from others so I took the chance. It did work fine for about 1 month, but then the material somehow became porous and my tire started to leak air. Being thats its dangerous to drive on a semi-flat tire I took it to a shop to get it repaired. The shop said that they could not repair it because they didn't know the angle at which the nail went in and suggested that I buy a new tire. Considering the price I had to pay for this, plus the new tire I had to buy; I lost big time. I could have just gone to a repair shop and paid $15 bucks and I would have been better off. $14 for this item plus new tire $60 = $74 versus the 20 for a normal repair. It cost me $54 to use this defective item."
4,It may or may not work - still 4 stars,"I used Dynaplug twice.First time on a relatively new tire (Ford Escape) that was punctured by a nail in the block area of thread. I was not able to get the Dunaplug through. I used too much force and eventually broke it. Took the tire to a tire shop and had the tire fixed for under $20.Second time, the puncture in F150 tire was from a small diameter screw. The hole was in the ""pit"" of the thread (tire was quite worn). This time I was very careful in inserting the Dunaplug. You have to wiggle it so that it starts to follow the direction of the puncture and only then apply force to push it through.Overall, I think it's worth its price but be aware that it may not work on some punctures, plus it is easy to break.I will keep it in my truck for emergencies"
1,Didn't Work for Me,"Unfortunately, the Dynaplug didn't work for me. The tip broke off inside of the tire and the stem, which is suposed to stop up the hole, remained inside of the tool and I couldn't get it out. With my purchase plus shipping, it was a total waste. I had to purchase a liquid tire plug, which did work well."
1,"Good idea, but poorly made","I bought this about a year ago and had a chance to use it today.Total Failure.The puncture was small, making it difficult to insert the plug. Finally after it just started to go in, the metal tube on the Dynaplug tool buckled and bent over. The tool simply is not strong enough to work unless the leak is large enough. If they had simply used a stronger tube on the tool, it would have been a great tool. As it is, it is worthless, and you cannot depend upon a tool that breaks so easily when repairing a typical flat.What a waste. Good thing I had my motorcycle tire plug kit with me, as it worked perfectly due to a better design.Very disappointing."
1,Total waste of money,"I bought these Dynaplugs based on the reviews and thought I would have an easier time with plugging tires due to the sharp tip. Well I was TOTALLY wrong, I could not even get one (1) of the plugs into the handle in order to attempt a repair, each of the 4 (very short, skinny) plugs were limp and could not be inserted. I was really flabergasted! How can anyone say this worked. I had to end up buying the trusted old repair tools for about $10 with 5 plugs that work. I was really surprized at the size of these plugs, they are TINY, they will probably only work on a lawn mower tire of something that small, IF you get it inserted! NEVER again will I try the Dynaplug."
5,Permanent fix?,"So it's Friday afternoon when my low tire light comes on. I spot a piece of metal lodged in the tire 1/16"" off the sidewall in the tread. I really needed my car and didn't want to spend Saturday in the tire shop. Had the product delivered on Saturday. Did the repair in under 5 min. That night I drove over 100 miles. Since then, I have driven 2500 miles without loosing air. Until this morning. I was parked on the plug all weekend, and this morning was down 7 psi. Filled it up and drove 150 miles today. It's time for a new tire, but I'm thrilled with the plug. I keep them in my car(it didn't come with a spare due to the brake package). Would buy again."
1,waste of money!,"I bought and returned this item today. My 2 1/2 year old loves JoJo, I bought this as a potty training incentive for her. It's really cute in the box. But then you take it out and realize what a piece of junk it is. The oven didn't stay shut and the swing kept falling off. The ""carpet"" on the two ends of the playhouse are just pieces of cardboard not even stickers, those will be lost in 2 seconds on the hands of a 2-3 year old."
2,Disney should be embarrassed,"This is not remotely worth $18. The figures must be strapped to the swing via an elastic loop. This is too difficult for a 3-year-old, and was even a bit tedious for me. The pie didn't pop out of the oven as it was suppsoed to, and won't even come when I try to grab it. There is no point to the little cardboard rugs and wall hangings. All my daughter really wants in a house is doors that open and maybe an item or two of furniture. This doesn't even really have those."
1,Disney should be asahmed to put their name on this!,"I was so dissapointed by this toy. It is made so poorly that within the first 5 minutes the house was in two pieces. My house was missing the swing. I would not recomend this toy to anybody. It was a good idea, but to say the least it still needs a lot of work!"
4,Very good but watch the ingrediant lists,Susan goin is a great chef with a great natural style of cooking that highlights the superior ingediants that she uses. If you don't have those ingrediants handy in your market she urges you to not get hung up on that. If your an advanced cook and can punt this is a great book you will enjoy; if you are not an accomplished cook and live in an area of the country which does not have artisen farmers this book may not be for you.The recipes are set up for six portions which is fantastic as it is a dinner party book. She wrote this to encourage us to have a full table and to break bread and share your table with family and friends which really should be a habit and I applaud her. It is a beautiful book with a heartfelt introduction and sentimental rememberances by Ms . Goin which will make you long for all the meals you missed at the family table. A great effort and a nice addition to your shelf.
5,Delicious yet simple,"This is one of my favorite cook books ever. I love the concept of seasonal ingredients. I had expected the recipes to take the typical 'top chef' approach - really hard, complex with tough to find ingredients. I was surprised by how easy the recipes are - and the outcome is extraordinary. Everything I have tried, from roasted apples, to the arugula and pomegranate salad, to braised short-ribs, has been outstanding. I found the directions crystal clear. And, the few times the ingredients were not readily at hand, the substitution was obvious (vanilla ice cream that I bought at the store instead of home-made cinnamon was just fine with the roasted apples). Well written, beautifully illustrated and photographed - this is a must have for even a semi-serious cook."
3,recipes not proofed or checked,"I enjoyed reading this book but it looks like the recipes weren't proofed or double checked. I only made two things, but had problems with both.The Devil's chicken thighs with braised leeks and dijon mustard is not clear about what temperataure, when to do what. It did taste terrific, but I need to study and correct a lot of small things.The double-choclate bundt cake recipie is missing something. I bake ALL the time and this sounded terrifc, but the cake fell and I couldn't serve! However it also did taste terrific.The book is beautiful, with lucious photographs, but I hesitate to use it for other then reading in bed.This is the first time I ever wrote a review, but felt I had too!"
5,Wonderful!,"This book is beautiful, full of great and fantastic recipes - and most of all encouraging -- Ms. Goin tells us that we can do it - don't be intimidated...so I made the ricotta gnocchi, several of the pork and chicken dishes - outstanding! Buy this book."
1,Great cookbook - Terrible Kindle Edition,"I have the print version, and love it, so I decided to get the Kindle version for my iPad. Big mistake! The kindle version is missing quite a few numbers, and fractions don't display properly. It's not good when the ingredients just say ""tablespoons thyme"" without a proper amount. Since Kindle versions can't be returned, I'm basically stuck with a useless file."
1,Not the Plan,"Change is not the Plan I knew...hence the name, I guess. Travis & company traded in their quirky original hook-ridden sound for a place in the well-trodden indie pop black hole. Everyone Is saying that this album shows a maturing band; a mature sound. Personally, I think that they lost sight of what their sound was. Change tashed nearly every element that made me like the Plan in the first place. Where's the red brick boat? Where's the dancable beat? Darn it all where's the fun?"
5,BLEGH!! THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!,"Whoa, what was i thinking when my brother asked me to listen to this album he owned. This album got big points off because i never seen this band on TRL. WHY does my brother listen to such bad music like this? It sounds like dave matthews, and he is UNPUNK!! These guys make no sense and these lyrics rip off countless other bands. LONG LIVE NEW WEEZER, JIMMY EAT WORLD, and all the other real emo bands out there!! PUNK RAWK FOREVER!! DUDE!!"
5,Dplan owns your soul....,"Many bands have attempted to recreate the Dismemberment Plan's sound in the last couple years, but it's pretty hard to really do that considering the sound vastly changes from album to album. Emergency and I is powerful with lots of synth's and keyboards, and Change sounds almost like they recorded it the day after E&I when they were a little bit tired from rocking so hard. Is Terrified is more poppy and fun, while ! is more rock based with barely any synthesizers and a much rawer sound all together. All around, this album has a nice, relaxing, quality sound. All the lyrics to every song are amazing; the sequencing in this album is great too. Every song belongs where it was placed. Any Dplan album you buy is an investment you will not regret. An amazing band, one of my absolute favorites."
4,"Very informative,wonderful illustrations,and funny.","A very informative tome, with many wonderfulillustrations by various artists to satisfythe readers visual taste.Wonderfully writtenwith a touch of humor to keep things interesting on an otherwise dark subject."
3,Fun to look at. Entertaing. I don't remember a thing.,"I lied. I do remember a tad of the information on Lilith, but that may just be a culmination of other things I've read on her, and not what was in the book.This book presents itself to you: the smooth texture of the cover, the small/longish size, the riveting pictures. That's why I'm giving it three stars instead of two. It's an aesthetically pleasing book to read.The book is filled with tidbit information: little sections on many things. The kind of stuff you read once and then forget. Oh, you'll probably hang onto a couple of things, but will you look at again? Remember it with fondness? Maybe.If you're a collector of this genre it may be just your thing. But I prefer something more solid and encyclopedic to reference. Aesthetics only go so far."
2,Eeehhhh.....,Would have been better if it didn't contribute to the Fundamentalist paranoia about witchcraft sweeping the nation.
5,Cute illustrations.,Fun story with cute illustrations. My kids like looking for the hiding duck on every page. I like how the story is set up to grow with the child's reading level.
3,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,i am interested to buy this book but i want to knowits index and year of the study
2,Spy Sweeper,"I don't even have it on my machine at the moment. Get that, you pay for something and don't use it. The irritating fact that it holds up your computer for a length of time at start up and you can't do anything. Its just like the computer is locked up and then finally Spy Sweeper releases it and you can go to work. Very Very irritating!"
3,"Excellent phone support, slows system, doesn't catch everything","I bought Spysweeper to try to get rid of an infection. Their phone support was excellent. However, the software slows the start-up considerably and freezes the system when it's run. It did not succeed in removing infection either."
5,An under-rated sixties pop/R+B singer,"Brook had many wonderful hits from 1959 to 1970, collected here on this 20-track compilation. The biggest hits (all top ten pop hits) were It's just a matter of time, So many ways, Kiddio, The boll weevil song, Hotel happiness, Rainy night in Georgia and the two duets with Dinah Washington - Baby you've got what it takes and A rocking good way. Seven of the others made the top twenty.Most of the songs fall into the general category of easy-listening pop/R+B, but Brook demonstrated that he could do much more, as with his covers of the folk songs Frankie and Johnny and The boll weevil song. His gospel roots are evident in the biblical song Shadrack.Brook may not have achieved the mega-stardom that he deserved, but he certainly made his mark and helped to break down the barriers for later generations of R+B singers."
3,Best and Worst Songs,"There are only five songs worth hearing on this album and 15 songs that I ""disabled"" so I didn't have to hear them. The best were: Just A Matter of Time, You've Got What It Takes, Kiddio, Fools Rush In, and A Rainy Night in Georgia. Brook Benton has a superb voice, but unfortunately his choice of songs is either terrific or very boring. How much control he had over his material is a fair question, because a voice like this should be recording smash hits 90% of the time. This CD reflects a lot of very mediocre songs. I always hated the Boll Weevil Song, but you may love it. I would recommend strongly that you buy this as a USED cd if you are looking for only a few select songs that were his very best."
4,Great for its audience,"My daughter recently discovered Calico Critters. Since their web site is a bit lame, I went to Wikipedia and discovered that outside of the USA, the brand is called Sylvanian Families. When I added this film to out Netflix queue it wasn't available for quick shipping. When I checked Amazon I found this price, and Prime shipping, I decided that owning it would be better.The Stories are VERY simple, and the plot is hit you in the forehead obvious. Bu the animation reminds me of the 80 cartoons I used to watch, and it is a true joy to watch my children enjoying them. I found nothing objectionable in the content, and when we reached the end of the 7th episode I told them too bad their over. My daughters response, ""But daddy, we can watch them all over again""When I tucked them in, she told me she was wishing of going to he Sylvanian Forest in her dreams."
3,Interesting Compilation Of British Psychedlic Songs,"This album is a compilation of different British psychedlic tunes, which is really subjective to the listener & taste. It's hard for me to really give it a great or ok review, because I think the particular selection of songs will have a wide appeal to different people's music taste. If your looking for a compilation album of the evolution of British psychedlic songs, you may want to check this album out."
3,ok,"Well, being a huge fan of francois ozon I had to check this one out. All the short films are great but unfortunately the DVD format on this one sucks. You actually have to sit thru the whole thing and can't just skip around like the way you should on a DVD. This is almost like owning the VHS version.Otherwise it's good."
4,Some more interesting stories from Ozon,"After a year that contained that American release of two great Ozon films (Water Drops & Criminal Lovers), this DVD is a somewhat weak follow up. The four short films tell a story of certain coming of age milestones (the death of a parent, sexual experimentation, etc..). But it doesn't have the richness of his feature length films. But get it anyway. All his films have a story to tell."
5,Great early works by a newly minted master,"These were really fun to watch. Some are funny, some are daring, all of them original. Ozon's sensibility is indeed very clever. I especially loved the first short which involves an explosive game of spin the bottle among four teens."
5,outstanding film shows the effects of the war on children,a five star tearjerker with excellent cast showing the effects of the london blitz on that city/s youngest citizens--robert young portraying an american who has also suffered from the blitz and how he bonds with two children in particular--starts out a little slow --but a good classic movie with a very young margaret obrien
1,Journey for Margaret,I bought this video used. Video is in good condition. Large parts of the sound-track are MISSING. I am very disappointed.
4,Very good and it's usefulness extends beyond the workplace,"I ordered this book based on a reference in Wendy Appel's InsideOut EnneagramInsideOut Enneagram: The Game-Changing Guide for Leaders. 100% Fresh. It proved to be an excellent resource. Though it's focus and title are primarily workplace and work styles, the usefulness extends well beyond this.His view of the wings (one is a Shadow the other an Ally) aligns closely with conclusions I was coming to as a result of working with convergence theory. The implications extend beyond type growth to communication styles and strategies."
2,Not such a great deal,"The price may be cheap but you get what you pay for. I think that there are other books out there that do a better job of introducing interior decoration to first timers. This book did not show a wide range of design styles and the pictures are starting to look out-dated.Recommendation: Choose another book.Other Sources: If you want a better basic introduction to interior decoration, I suggest 1000 Practical Ideas for Home Decoration. This book even has tips for those who are design junkies. It has beautiful photographs, and many different styles are represented. Plus, the author has a great sense of humor. If you want to learn more about different design styles in particular, a good choice is The Ultimate Home Style Guide by Katherine Sorrell, or try the books from the Architecture and Design Library. They have books on styles ranging from Arts & Crafts to Retro Modern and from India Style to Mediterranean Style."
2,disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with the fact the seller said the book was new..... when I recieved it, it had may flaws and marks on the top and sides... :( Next time please indicate the book is used or has imperfections, so customer will not be suprised and disappointed when received..... thank you!!!!"
3,"Cute, but not very intertaining","I bought this for my daughter when she was about 8 months old. She played with it for a few months mainly because it plays music. She got most of her entertainment from turning it upside down instead of pushing or pulling the animals themselves. It is not very intuitive on how to change the settings on it and it gets very repetitive really fast. Also if you don't turn it off, it will start playing in the middle of the night for no reason whatsoever."
1,Switches broke on first use,cast metal housing with bend tabs broke and spring and switch guts shot everywhere. Contact is high current. but too much pressure on screw and the thing flew apart.
4,Saved a dog,I have a 12 year old Lab Shepard mix female dog with bad incontinence we tried Proin with little success. Tried a bed covered with a layer of plastic and blankets but she wouldn't always stay on it and it required constant washing it came to a point we thought we would have to put her down to save our wood floors and carpet. Get these with little hope but i have to say months later these things work fairly good. My dog drinks a ton and pees a lot. She has good days and bad days sometime she leaks through sometimes we have to change the diaper 3 or 4 times a day but it is manageable and we just throw them in the wash by now they have been washed 100 times and still seem to be holding up. My dog doesn't seem to mind wearing them. You will need about 5 of them to keep up but to delay from having to put down a loved pet it is worth it.
3,Almost fall off our lab,"There is only a small piece of velcro on the straps. Our lab is fit and has a nice waist so when we secure the diaper, the straps connect a couple inches up on the body of the diaper leaving nothing to hold for first couple inches in place. Due to this condition, the bottom couple of inches on both sides slide back and you end up continually pulling them back up. I don't think they would fall off but an extra couple of inches on the straps would help a lot."
3,pet diapers,"After using this product and several other reusable pet diapers I have found that baby diapers with a hole cut for the tail work much better and are less expensive. You can buy a variety of sizes and they do not leak. This diaper leaks badly and the area around the legs is not snug. Baby diapers are stretchier, do not leak and seem to be much more comfortable for my pet."
5,CAN'T DO WITHOUT,MY FAVORIATE PRODUCT FOR MY PETS. VERY SATISFIED. WILL USE THIS PRODUCT OFTEN. TKU :o)
1,Doggy Diaper Nightmare,"My Beagle HATED this product to say the least. We live in an upstairs apartment so when she has to go to the bathroom its hard to get my shoes on, get her leashed up and run her down a flight of stairs. She usually pees or worse on the floor before that. So i decided to try these for the times we cant get her outside fast enough. Well some reviews i read says it takes a few hours for your dog to get used to them. We tried them out for about a week and she never got used to them. She usually is so happy go lucky but she got depressed and confused. When she finally did go in them they leaked a bit. I wish i would have never wasted a dime on them. They may be helpful to some people, but for us it was a NIGHTMARE!!!"
1,Returned this,"I purchased one of these at my local pet store and loved it. So, I thought I may find one at a better price here. What I received was a 6 or 7 year old version of the current product. Very unhappy."
1,Not worth buying,"These were denim covered, the picture looks like a waterproof type material. They do not wash well at any tempature, with unsightly stains remaining on the outside. Also size guide was inaccurate. Cutting up a pair of thick cotton children's tights worked better, at a fraction of the price."
2,sizing off,Size small was too small and size medium was way too big. These pants evidently do not come out true to the advertized sizes
5,Works fine,"I purchased this for my sweet little yorkie so she can run free in the house while she is learning to potty train. I was using disposable and they get expensive! This diaper is much easier to put on. She hasnt actually had any accidents so not sure what that will be like when it happens! She doesn't mind wearing them at all and it saves a lot of floor cleaning time! I'm glad to have the washable diaper and even if it does leak how bad can it be! She is tiny! At least most of the pee will be in the diaper or so I hope anyway. I did use a panty liner too. Was a little disappointed that it was advertised to have a ""pouch"" to insert a liner for heavy urination. However, I received the ""new improved"" version and it does not have that. Pantyliners with adhesive seem to be okay though."
5,simply perfect,"Simple Solutions washable diapers are wonderful for dogs in season. I have used these in small on my chihaha and medium on my siberian husky, they are perfect. It allows them to be out of the kennel, in the house with the family and no messes on the floor. I is the thick pad inserts in the medium diaper and a womens panty liner fits perfectly for the small one. Try this product if you have a female that may go into heat. They stay on, do not slip or fall, like the disposables."
3,Not worth the extra money and color not as displayed,"I have been using the Simple Solution Coverups for our aging dog and then noticed they sold a diaper. After reading the reviews I decided to give to purchase one, thinking they would be more absorbent. It really isn't worth the extra money to me. You can buy almost two coverups for the price of one diaper. You still need to put in a pad of some sort into both the coverups and the diapers. Otherwise neither would hold the urine. (I use adult Poise pads which work well.) My other disappointment was the color. The color displayed is a teal blue. I received a denim diaper. The fabric is very stiff and just doesn't look that nice. It will serve its purpose, but this is the first and last ""diaper"" I will buy. I will go back to the Simple Solution Coverups."
3,Sizing issue,"Sizing for this product is not very accurate, from my experience. I determined the waist size of my dog and purchased the size recommended. I ended up purchasing 2 sizes greater for my dog before the product would fit. Smaller dogs may not have this issue, but for large dogs, I would recommend selecting a much bigger size. Too large is easier to remedy than too small."
1,Need to get the sizing right,"I've ordered 3 of these in different sizes. They state that for a male dog order the next larger size. But no matter what, they WON'T COVER HIS ""spout."" If you find a size that does go forward enough to cover it, the diameter is too big to stay on the dog (even if you wrap it one-and-a-half times around! Do NOT buy for male dogs. Get the waist wrap instead."
2,leaky pants,I bought this in 2 sizes and both are leaky. I used the pads that go with it which are just big sanitary napkins and it just did not work. By the way if your dog is becoming incontinent go to the vet. There is a drug that really helps. I hate using drugs but in this case it is worth it.
4,Doggie Diaper,"I was happy with the way that these wraps are made, but I had a problem with the sizing for my dogs.I have 2 small Jack Russell Terriers. Their waist sizes are 15"" and 16"".These wraps are TOO small for my dogs, and the medium wrap is a little too big.So great product, good price, but the size is no good for my dogs."
3,Won't work without a tail,"As soon as I opened the package, I realized that I had ignored a fundamental key to these diapers - the tail helps hold them on - and if you have Boxers like I do, or other crop tailed breeds, well, it's pretty much not going to stay on. It will depend, of course, on how much ""stub"" your dog has. My female boxer was cropped very close and she hardly has a stub at all.It was my own fault for being oblivious to that obvious fact - but wanted to write a review to make others aware of what I overlooked: NO TAIL - WON'T STAY ON!"
2,Good but itchy,This product is easy to use and looks great but since they changed the formula several years back it is almost a guaranteed bad reaction. I stopped using it for a year and recently picked it up again because they aren't many alternatives. After using it three times it has irritated me all three times and each subsequent time is worse than before. This will be my last attempt at it. I'm seeking something that doesn't tear my face up. Right under my lip it's weeping and oozing and just nasty. It burns and itches. Beware...I followed all the instructions and still this happens.
1,Just for Men,"I HAVE PURCHASED QUITE A FEW 6-PACKS. UNFORTUNATELY, OVER HALF OF THE BOXES THAT I HAVE PURCHASED, THE DARKER DYE IS BLACK UPON OPENING WHICH WON'T KEEP YOUR BEARD DARK. IF I'M LUCKY, THE DARK DYE WILL BE BRIGHT BROWN WHICH KEEPS YOUR BEARD DARK FOR DAYS. SO, BEWARE"
3,color starts fading in just 2-3 days.,"I have been using the Just for Men Brush-in color gel for coloring my side burns and mustache for quite sometime. It used to work well. More recently they must have changed the formulation, because the color starts fading after just 2-3 days. I am having to apply this twice a week. Previously I could go for 1-2 weeks before reapplication. I am looking for alternatives."
5,Great for the elderly,"I reviewed several exercise dvds trying to find something that would work for me since I am elderly (66), I am overweight and I have physical problems. I read reviews and narrowed my review to these stretch chair yoga dvdsby Patricia McCallum. And, I can honestly say that these are the best dvds you will find for ""starting"" the process of exercising for elderly people like me. It is mostly stretching which is very effective. I have exercised on and off all my adult life until several years ago. I've had several knee surgeries, have back problems, arthritis and asthma, so stretching is the best exercise for me. While I am just getting started with these dvds, so far these are working great for me. It is not exercising to me but more relaxing and stretching. It is a nice quiet time to myself. I would recommend these dvds to anyone who would enjoy some quiet relaxing stretching time just for themselves. And, I think the end results will be very beneficial."
1,NOT 1.2GHZ,"""New high power 1.2 GHz technology provides 300 feet range with solid stability""Deascription states that item is 1.2ghz Item is actually 2.4ghz I bought the 1.2 and 2.4 packages and both were the same item, from the same seller and Fullfilled By Amazon. Same Item, two different Asin's and the other Asin cost less."
4,not really a toy,"To me this isn't really a toy. Placed in front of the entrance door, I use this as a remote camera when I get a signal from my wireless alarm system. (I use SAGETV software and this camera is a separate source). Pros: easy to install, small, not noticable to many, complete of chargers (if it was for batteries, it would have really been a toy); Cons: Suffer intereference, image may disappear for some seconds then come again, but for what I am using it, it is great"
1,Fraud - Not 1.2 GHz as stated,"There are two models advertised on Amazon. This one is a few bucks more and is supposed to operated on 1.2 GHz BUT it does not!While the unit does cost a few bucks more it still operates on the old 2.4 GHz frequency that has a great deal of interference. This camera is on the same 2.4 GHz freq as my X10 wireless video cameras and I can't use it.The receiver actually has a 2.4 GHz decal (NOT a 1.2 GHz)The frequency is important especially if you have other wireless devices (cameras, Internet Routers, etc that work on the 2.4 GHz band.Rip off! If you expect to get what's advertised, you won't...This was sold by Amazingtech Inc Via Amazon.comAngered..."
2,Wireless camera,"The camera itself works really good, but the problem is that a new 9v battery will be totally dead in 90 minutes. So where ever you may need it, make sure that you have an alternate power source."
1,Don't waste your money,"The only good thing about this unit, was that it did come complete. When I had the camera positioned about 3-4 feet from reciever ( which is quite a bit closer than they advertise ), I could not get ANY Images at night. In daylight or bright lighting, the picture was marginal at best. I had really hoped all the negative reviews were wrong, but they weren't. Spend a little bit more (or even a lot more) and get a decent camera....this one isn't it !!!"
1,waste of money,Din't work for me.... not even with the antenas touching each other...all images are full of static and it is impossible to get a clear image... Do NOT Recommend
1,U STINK,OK received a call I did order these presents for Christmas. God bless you. Please trust this transaction. STEVE MILLER JR
4,Great Device,I got this for Christmas and its really fun. If its the camera gets to far from the receiver it gets blury but near it is really good quality. Overall I would say get this it is really fun to use and i recommend it.
1,Does not work for me,"My DVR is in my office with my wireless router. When I turn the camera on, the wireless router stops working. Also, I could not tune in a picture (well, I could, but it was very noisy) and this is with the camera and receiver about 4 feet apart. I tried all 4 channels with identical results.Also, it seems flakey that you have to ""tune"" the receiver. It has a tuning knob you have to adjust for a good picture - just like an old analog radio. Does not seem appropriate in our current digital electronics age.Does not work for me. It is going back. Your milage may very. Good luck."
2,Not what you would expect,"This product was disappointing not what I expected, I think that this product could of been better set up. Connecting to camera & component very poor."
2,It works,"I purchased this item to be used as a baby monitor because it's way cheaper than a regular baby monitor unit you would buy at baby stores. Besides, I already have a small tv monitor and I just needed this wireless camera and receiver. It works just fine and it transmit signal from the camera to the receiver about 30 to maybe 50 feet away, upstairs and downstairs the house...the only problem I encountered was it shut down my wireless router..and the resolution is expected for its price..reasonable and it would have some minor static on the tv screen.. Otherwise, it works."
4,Good product,"It is a good camera, I just wish the camera could work with another type of battery, but overall its a good product. Talking about the seller, I got the product on time."
1,I can read,"The instructions were very vague and not much help, if it hadn't been for the pictures, it might have taken me a couple of minuets longer. But besides that I could not get a picture, even in the house 10 feet apart. I would like to try again if there were some better instructions available. I will except any help offered from anyone who thinks they know how to make it work. I am assuming there is nothing wrong with the product, I would love to get it to work"
5,Great Book,This book is user friendly. Very comprehensive. Roberts Rules have never been easier to understand. Highly recommend.
1,Would be able to critique if I could gain access!!,I can't get it to download to my PC so I haven't been able to use it! I can't get any assistance here on the website either. Very disappointed!!!
4,Lots of fun - but dusty,I've run through one set of these on my '86 MR2. They are fantastic for stopping and control. A definite boost over the stock pads. I really wish they made a set for the rear disks!When comming off a fast cruise - like a freeway off-ramp you can feel the initial bite getting stronger as they heat up. Most cars are either flat-line or fading a but while these are geting better.My one complaint - that I was aware of goin in was the dust. Wash the car one day and with just a commute to work and back the front wheels are showing dust. I may try the HPS next time for this reason alone.I'm running the LTS on my 4Runner and the HPS on my son's Mazda. All in all HAWK makes great pads.
5,Vigil Review,"This CD is great. What a great way to honor those who suffered and died in the tragedy of September 11, 2001."
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this CD. It is a worthly effort and the idea and concept is great. You have to separate the concept from the finished product. Yes, its a worthy cause. But, from a musical point of view most of the songs are not that interesting. Some seem very amateurish. Buy the CD because you want to support the effort but don't expect great music."
4,Educational,This DVD was made decades ago and teaches the basics about musical instruments in Ghana. I just wish it was longer than 22 minutes.
1,Not Very Cuban,"I'm not sure why they call this cooking the Cuban Way. There are only a few Cuban recipes here, and nothing that really stands out. Low-fat and Vegetarian are two terms that are completely foreign to Cuban cuisine! There are much better Cuban cookbooks: Memories of a Cuban Kitchen, Three Guys from Miami Cook Cuban, and Cuba Cocina just to name a few."
2,Its kinda Cuban,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains standard Central and South American foods such as Piccadillo and Salpicon and a few specialties.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
1,What A Mess,"I bought this because their are some extended mixes that were not previously available, but this is an awful mess. It seems that they tried to add a hip-hop flavor to these songs, but what they did was mess up great songs. This is a good example of where DJ Mixers think they have more talent than the original artists. The mixes are boring, overblown, and very hard to listen to. Don't waste your money; go out to sites such as GEMM or MusicMatch and buy the original 12"" of these songs."
4,An incredible start,"The much-acclaimed Karameikos set is perhaps one of the best ways to start off a fascinating campaign in a world that is as much based on wit and diplomacy as base hack-and-slash. Two low-level adventures are provided in complete detail (with CD support, which I did not find too useful), but the prize catch in this set is the enormous volume of Karameikos history, language, and culture, which completely describes the minute details of the this Kingdom in the Known World. The art is colorful and realistic, and the text is quite masterfully written and is very believable in places. Although the sound CD is not of much help during normal gameplay, it is a great source of sound effects not normally available."
2,A Silly Inconvenience,"...There is no question about NIB. You know it's the best.As for the CD ROM edition, I have a big problem. I MUST run it from a CD drive. You can load the program into the hard drive but NOT the DATA to run it without the CD. I called them and they confirmed. My notebook computer (the light weight IBM ThinkPad X series) comes with external CD ROM that I don't usually carry it with me to reduce weight. So I have everything I need in the hard drive, including the entire Libronix Digital Library System, 1,000 MB of data. But now, I am not allowed to put this 85 MB of data into my hard drive. Even if I have a built-in CD drive on my notebook, I will still prefer to run it from the hard drive and not to carry the CD with me because I could lose it. I think it's just an outdated paranoia, which will hinder the widely usage of the great NIB, and prevent the growth of the software company itself. What a shame!"
4,"Great resource, VISTA version now available","I bought this years ago and used it quite a bit, until my computer died and I bought a Vista computer. It didn't work with VISTA. But, I just got off the phone with Abingdon and they have a Vista version and are offering a free exchange.Send the original disc to Abingdon Press Tech Support, ATTN: VISTA EXCHANGE, 201 8th Ave. South, Nashville, TN 37203. Include your name, street address and phone number and they will send you an upgrade for Vista."
1,drctt,"I wish I would have bought the books. This fine resource is greatly diminished by its incompatability with my VISTA laptop. At this point, it's totally useless to me. When I initially tried the CD-Roms in my laptop, I wrote the company, naively assuming that they would provide a simple update patch (or something). No response. Not even an ""we're working on it. We realize many of you have upgraded since this software was created."" Nothing. $500-some bucks down the drain. On another note, I purchased the very expensive LOGOS software when I graduated from seminary in 2006. It worked on XP but not VISTA. But guess what. They provided a patch (or whatever) to enable it to work on my VISTA laptop. It was an easy fix. No hassle. No big deal. I find it very unfortunate (to say the least) that NIB's publisher would put out a product and not provide an upgrade to keep up with the advances in the technology so that they could maintain a happy customer base."
5,Fantastic!!,"These books are fantastic...just like the adult versions. Anyone who would call them ""unholy"" because they propose that ""the only way to live is God's way"", is sadly, lost. If you understand that God's way truly is the only way, and you want to reinforce this idea in your children, buy them these books. They are entertaining and thought provoking. They pave the way to meaningful discussions with your pre-teen. They are definitely a great value to the spiritual home!"
1,Do not read.,"When I was given this book for Christmas, I was not thinking of how bad it would be. My younger sisters are 7 and 10, and I wanted to read it before they got their little fingers on it. Well, I read it. Okay, I am a Baptist, so therefore I am a Christian. BUT, this book was so distrubing to me. This book states that teenagers and children should NOT question God in their lives. And isn't it that children need to learn all they can about God and make their own conclusion? I say, do not scare children like this. It is poorly written and should not be introduced into our lives."
1,If Christ really behaves like this...,"I want him completely and utterly out of my life!!! Please, I beg of you, read ANYTHING besides these unholy books that teach children that the way of God is the only way and they shouldn't question it and try to find their own religion!! Don't bring this upon them please!!"
1,Propaganda,"These books are unadulterated fundamentalist propaganda. That might be ok for adults, who have already chosen their path in life. But when such books are written for children, in the obvious hope to inculcate them into a particular religious view, it goes from ""preaching to the choir"" to Neuremberg rallies. They don't even have the saving grace of being well written. The strokes are so broad, the characters so one-dimensional, the ""message"" so obvious, that you would get as much from beating the child over the head with the book and yelling ""sinner!sinner!sinner!"" as you would letting them read it. If a Muslim, a Jew, or (G-d forbid) a secular humanist created such tripe and it ended upon on library shelves the afficianados of this garbage would burn the building down.The bottom line: Badly written, poorly developed fundamentalist propaganda."
5,Awesome for kids,I bought this for my 8 and 10 year old daughters. I read the first two out loud to them. It was a great time for sharing what will come in the end. The girls were both able to keep up with the characters easily. They were concerned about everyone's welfare. It provided a great oppurtunity to further discuss the end times. And how easy it is for good people to go the wrong way.
3,"It is refined, hence not so golden",This is refined jojoba oil. I was disappointed that it was lighter than the one I bought from the store. I am still using it. It works fine. But I prefer the golden one.
1,This book is radical and contradictory.,"I find the approach suggested in this book to be too radical to be realistically followed. The book refers to and has positive quotes from some popular experts but contradicts their nutrutional approach by advocating a high carb, low protein diet."
3,An interesting garage Band,"When I first listened Flowerz Flyte, I didn't know exactly what I was discovering, I love psych stuff and this band was a totally surprise for me...essentially covers of 60 bands, It was a fresh garage band, not THE garage band I ever heard, but it was fine to me....listen the ""All Day and All the Night"" version (the famous Kinks song), it's a nice psych band, I think"
4,Gone But Not Forgotten,"I was not sure what to expect when I bought this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. The authors spent a great amount of time gathering material, first-hand anecdotes, charts and other information to present a complete story of the SPs Modoc Line which ran through northeastern California and western Nevada. The production values and printing quality are typical of Oso Publishings work, in a word - excellent. The thoughtful selection of maps is a major plus, too, although somehow on one of the maps, California was placed north of Oregon. At any rate, the place names were correct and it in no way detracted from the text. The Modoc is no more, of course, but this book is certainly a fitting tribute to one of the lesser known lines of the Southern Pacific. This work will be of interest to anyone who appreciates western railroading."
4,If your child like the cartoon they will love the soft dolls.,"My 17 month carries this doll with him everywhere. He loves to cuddle it in the car, sleep with it at night and hold it when the cartoon comes on. The only problem I have with it is that it is not machine washable so I'm constantly wiping it with disinfectant wipes. We also bought Goliath who doesn't have any buttons but my son loves him just as much."
4,Good quality. Fit my head perfectly!,"My head is a little bit bigger than normal people. The normal size is 22.25 - 22.50 inches and my head size is about 22.75. I tried many 'only one size' sunhats available in stores before. I always felt so tight and had a headache once I put it on for 5 minutes. Therefore I gave up buying a normal size hat from the retail stores. I am glad I found Sun Grubbies here. They have small, midium, large, and extra large!! I ordered a large wide brim panama sunhat and the package arrived in my house very soon. They put bubble bags in the box to make sure the shape of the hat doesn't change. The quality of this hat is very good. I brought it with my when I went traveling in Canadian Rockies and it protected my face from sunburn very well. It is a pity this hat is not foldable but I knew it before I placed the order."
1,Cracker Box Quality,"We bought six of these lights to place outside our midwest home. The lights were made of extremely thin material, looked like tin. The finish was appropriate but very thin and probably would not hold up to the elements. We returned all of them without installing because of how frail and cheap looking they are. The picture gives a false impression of being rugged."
1,not very impressed,"i cant say ive been impressed by any of courtneys books,i reckon if he was more honest in his accounts his books would be better,he`s too into the whole self promotion thing,the publics a bit sick of dave courtney,ive always thought his books were just a few parts fantasy too a few parts 3rd or 4th hand stories,his first appearance as a celeb was years ago on a documentary about debt collecting,and he was threatening an old man,and he took his pension off him.all the recent scandals with his wife and children just go to show what sort of person he really is,i for one will be glad too see the back of courtney,he`s a sad caricature,a dog thats had his day,he should do the honorouble thing and bow out"
2,Oh stop it please !,to coin Daves catch phrase. Not the best book to flow from Daves (stolen?) pen mainly covers the trial of a corrupt copper. I found my self skipping sections of the book - Did we really need to know that his wife is Bi-sexual ? Or that he has a taste for swingers meetings ? In a crime book of all places. Not the best but worth reading if you have seen his others.
3,It's just ok...,"There are 4 songs I like on this cd, I don't know how Paul's songwriting skills have diminished so quickly...'Me And Your Momma' is a kewl track though."
2,Bad Album From A Myspace Addict,"After the release of ""Sunrise To Sunset"" Paul Wright became addicted to Myspace, he composed songs for the site, he spends so much time on the site it's sad. Unfortunately, Myspace has also drained his talent. ""Saturday"" is a great dance song, a great fusion of disco and rap. Great rap, Paul can rap, better than most rappers, which isn't hard to do, but still pretty cool.Unfortunately, the Myspace syndrome starts kicking in and the CD goes downhill, literally. By the end of the album you're praying for the ride to stop, not because it's scary and unknown, but because it's frankly boring. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Paul Wright, his first two albums are excellent! But Myspace has taken away his talent. Now he is nothing more than a quickly fading memory. Sorry Paul, but drop Myspace while you still can, it's not too late!"
1,Infantile twaddle,"The author seriously needs to review what niche market there is ""traditional Witchcraft"" as the material herein is already covered elsewhere in a more ethical, efficient, and straight forward manner. Whilst I can see the need for some people to be as dark an mysterious as they can, puleeeze, this is way OTT. Surely the market for dark-childe-ov-kaos is pretty limited."
2,I was hoping for something more listenable.,"If poorly recorded roots music is of interest to you, you might want to consider buying this CD. The poor recording is, of course, not the fault of the company making the CD. The recordings are made from old originals that were made with primitive equipment in primitive conditions. There is no arguing that the music is historically significant. But, I was hoping that there might be one or two songs I could consider listenable. Each year I search for obscure music to add to a large collection of holiday CD's. This one, unfortunately, will not be one that I count among the worthwhile purchases. Pairing this with the John Waters CD is, I suppose, logical. I would recommend that one first, however, on the basis of sound quality if nothing else."
1,Junk,This steering wheel grip was ripped while I tried to install it. I followed the instruction and the size was correct too. It ripped like piece of card board. This item is worthless. This is a piece of junk even if they gave it to me I would trash it immediately. I don't know why somebody would sell or produce this grip in the first place. Bad Bad product.
3,opps,"Smaller than I thought, inside was bumpy and did not have enough room/empty space. Looked hand painted but not very nicely."
5,Buddha,Is a wonderful addition to my office. Makes me smile! Was surprisingly sturdy and large. Shipped very quickly. Could not be happier.
3,Superficial Overview,"Very good overview of the field, but a little overextended in its breadth. Much of the material was so superficial that it gave no real understanding of the topic that would be useful in a practical sense. It redeems itself with a good list of references for each topic so the reader could study further if one particular area was especially interesting."
3,A bit shallow,"This book provides a very brief overview on a broad range of topics, but does not give much depth. However, it does give a valuable list of resources for further study."
4,Nice read!,"I was excited to read this book and I'm glad I did. It was a little bit boring in the beginning because it starts with the basics and basic psychology and I already know most of the stuff. But it is a very good beginners book, I'm a nurse so nothing to do with forensics but have always been interested in these things. Glad I bought it."
2,Just the Facts,"The work tends to be dry and mechanical, very much a textbook style. Dr. Girod would have done well to take a creative writing course at some point during his stellar academic career."
3,Too small,"I expected a much larger pillow...disappointed in size(about half a standard pillow).Product is stitched well and looks good but again, too small!"
4,Basic proof techniques,"This book is the ""magic decoder ring"" for terse proofs. This book should be passed out to every undergraduate taking the first mathematical analysis course. Numerous examples and exercises are included. The typesetting and notation are very readable. The great strength of this book is that the proofs used for exercises are restricted to the level of algebra and set theory. This makes it easy to concentrate on the technique of proof rather than the specific results. Also check out Polya's book ""How to Prove It"" and Velleman's book of the same name."
3,The Velleman is better and costs less too,"One can learn to do proofs with this book but the examples and exercises seem to be geared for the average eighth grader. The reader would be better served with How to Prove It : A Structured Approach by Daniel J. Velleman, who's exercises are more similar to what one has to tackle in a normal college proof course. The only draw back of the Velleman is there are no solutions for the exercises."
4,How to Read and Do Proofs: An Introduction to Mathematical Thought Processes,Are you in an abstract algebra class or in a real analysis class? Are you having trouble with proofs? This is an excellent ancillary to your course textbook.
2,no comparison to 1st edition,"while the author's approach to proofs is refreshingly logical, he takes away from the wholeness of his work by including ONLY odd-numbered answers. his first edition had all of the answers to all of the questions. most students of mathematics are self-taught and highly motivated. with the exclusion of even- numbered answers, the author has saved a few pages and a bit of work.i feel fortunate to have a copy of the first addition which i purchased at a used book store for a buck. you can't beat that! :-)"
4,deep cuts from teh 80's,"beyond the obvious slaughter and enuff z'nuff songs,much of this disc is more obscure tunes from the 80's.at the time i can recall hearing these songs on the radio in semi-often rotation.junkyard and every mothers nightmare were pretty coll bands.there was so many bands around at the time alot of these did'nt stay on the airwaves.a good collection though."
2,Thin but not super absorbent,They don't absorb enough. Most of the time I used two to avoid accidents.
4,Time to Laugh,Heard Alex at the Scottish festival in McPherson Kansas. He is a great entertainer and a heck of a dry witt. Loved his show and his comedy.
5,TWO FAMILIAR VOICES,"I first heard this excellent album nearly 40 years ago from a friend and taped about two thirds of it on a little cassette player which had a microphone I stuck in front of a portable record player. I've enjoyed it fairly often since then, and copied it to a fresh tape several times. I am amazed that this obscure album is available on CD, and I'm glad I can now get the several excellent songs that I missed when I taped but have never forgotten -- ""Lazarus,"" ""Grizzly Bear,"" ""You Got to Hurry,"" and ""Columbus Stockade.""The nylon-string guitar sounds a bit strange for blues, and one of the voices (I don't know whose) sounds a bit stilted, but the song selection is fantastic and the vigor of the performances is terrific. The ""Frankie and Albert"" performance is worth the price of the album. The song has been recorded countless times, but I've never heard a version with this much drama and detail."
5,very happy,I use this for dutch oven cooking. It is up high enough to work for me. I have also converted it to a grill with a few easy modifications.
1,Verbatim,"I've bought 5 packs of these 2x DVD+R DLs since my store in my town doesn't have any Verbatim disks. And from being desperate, and not knowing how garbage these disks really are. And out of 4 packs, every single pack had 1 disc error. (waste of money and time) That means I really only got 4 disks out of 8. I have 2 more left and I will only get 1 to actually work. 50% chance. I had a friend who told me Verbatim works great, and out of 20. All 20 burned with no problem. Don't waste your money or time."
3,The Platters - Enchanted,"Disappointed in this recording....A cassette of the Platters ""greatest hits"" that I have had for some time is much better in the quality and tonality of the music recorded...On this CD several of the original recordings did not include the opening bars to some of the numbers...."
1,Doesn't Fit Mazda,"This kit is mostly generic and will not replace the hardware in your Mazda 323 brake drum. I used the shoe retainer pins and the spring steel clips, along with two of the springs. Then I went to the local auto parts store and bought the correct kit and finished the job."
1,Don't Waste Your Money - Buy Another Book,"This book touts itself on the cover as being America's Guide to Volunteering and Community Service, but it comes across instead as being a scathing political commentary, spending way too much time bashing President Bush before it even gets into the guide portion of the book, which is a scant resource, at best.If it stuck to being a comprehensive guide about volunteering and community service it might have actually lived up to its title. If I had only browsed through it in a bookstore before buying it online. Oh well. Live and learn. Very offensive to any republican volunteers, in my opinion. Tossing it in the trash right now."
2,Not all is from the Christian perspective,"Not all of this book is written from the Christian perspective. Check out topics of Abortion and Homosexuallity. These topics have no bibical references listed as to God's point of view. The story of Adam and Eve is mentioned as a fairly tail. There are many other, much more suitable materials, you can use to talk to your kids about sex (from a Godly perspective) than this."
2,Not impressed like everyone else,"Maybe I am missing something, I ordered this and expected the book to be great, reading most of these positive reviews. WRONG! I would at least expect the book to have color pictures of the titled stories. NONE exist, this is not worth the price!"
4,A good read,"I purchased this book on a whim, since I am a huge Night Gallery fan. i read it in three days while on vacation. it was interesting and a very easy read. It gave me a new prospective while watching the shows again. Lets just say it enhanced the experience knowing what was going on behind the scenes"
2,disappointing,"Not a bad book, but not great. Describes the 1.2 release of linux. Unfortunately, I was hoping for the linux version of the excellent Design and Implementation of 4.4BSD, and was severely disappointed. This is more of an overview of the kernel than anything else. Details are severely lacking, and it provides relatively little information that is not found in the khg (kernel hackers guide). If you need a introduction to the kernel though, this is a good book."
2,"OK introduction, but out of date","If you want an introduction on how the Linux kernel works, this book does an OK job, though the information is slightly out-of-date for Linux 2.0 and inadequate for recent 2.1 kernels. However, it wants to teach how to write device drivers, and here it falls far from its goal. When writing a Linux device driver, there is a ""how"", but there is, perhaps more important, a ""how _not_"" (for instance, don't do noninterruptible blocking system calls) which are either glossed over, or done wrong in the examples."
2,Vauge,"The stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner. Though it is well organised it lacks clear representation. It looks like linux man-pages are explained in an organised manner. Could be used as a reference book, but not for learning."
1,Not recommended for educational purpose,This book is lacked of organization. Some of the concepts are so vague because of the POOR English tone.
1,"Unclear presentation, crucial material missing","The book is largely a comment of the source code, most which is branded as ""too complicated"". System administrators can not find the stuff that interests them (how to determine time slice, how to control paging/and swapping, what kernel variables are available for tweaking) The presentation style is unclear, superficial and assumes that the readers are the people who wrote kernel itself. I didn't learn anything and so far I consider my money wasted on this book. A note to Amazon.com: if you expect us to pay $41 for the book, be so kind and publish the table of contents!"
3,"A liitle out-date, but still a good book for OS concepts","This book is a little outdated today as it covers the older 2.0 kernels. If you are reading this book and following it up on a 2.4 kernel you will find many changes.The book does contain the source code of the reference kernel it is written on.I suppose its time a new updated edition is published.However the commentry on a older kernel does not reduce the value of this book. It is a good book to understand the OS concepts as applied to Linux kernel.This book can be a good companion to Silberschatz/Galvin's ""Operating Systems Concept"" in a college course.Another value of this book is purely historical, in case someone desires to compare older and newer kernels with a high-level view."
1,Not for the faint of heart.,"For me this book was quite a disappointment. The English is too breezy, awkward, and quite often extremely difficult to understand. While I understand that authors are not all native English speakers it appears that if it was edited the editor didn't write English either. While the blurb says that it was updated for the 2.0 kernel it is really about the 1.0.x series. I found little I could trust about the 2.0.x kernel."
2,not a teaching book,"I don't think this book teaches the Linux kernel at all. The writing is hard to understand and there is a total lack of examples. Some times they would pull out pieces of Linux source code and call that an example. At other times they would give you a theoretical three paragraph discussion and call that an example. I guess technically they did give an example, but those examples don't teach because they are too hard. Books are suppose to give easy examples that get progressively harder instead of dumping the real thing at you right-a-way.The book is really for people who already knows Linux or Unix and need to look up what a particular function do (because Kernel function are not in the ""man"" pages) The only good part about this book is that the index is very complete so you can look up an unknown function quickly - that's basically why I kept the book. But as a teaching device - which was what I was looking for - the book fails completely."
3,Made with affection despite...,"This is an interesting historical perspective of Dino with rather an excess of the partnership b/w footage. Whilst it is obvious that the makers have been affectionate with the material, unfortunately it seems to me, they had limited access to choice material (like his tv shows) and miniscule genuine interviews with people who actually knew him. If you want a potted history of the great entertainer, then this is ok. If you would like to experience his true genius on dvd, treat yourself to 'Thats Amore'. Hey producers!.. more tv compilations plleeease!!"
4,Nice change from the bike's original seat,"-Easy and fast installation, only needed a wrench-Definitely less harsh on my...seated area...than the bike's original seat. Still experience some discomfort when I ride, but I was expecting that since I'm doing trails more so than cruises.-Softer and more stable than a removable seat padNot sure about durability as I've only had it a few weeks, but so far it's kept my heiney relatively pain-free, which has let me keep riding!"
3,"Good Grief, It's A Bicycle Seat...does it need a star?","Regrettably not what I expected. I am a ""vertically challenged"" person, only five feet tall, and my exercise bike is very uncomfy for me. The new seat does help, but not enough. So, I give it three stars, if one must ""star"" every purchase."
5,Great Seat...Great Price,All I can say....Heaven for your bottom! I was looking for a super comfortable seat at a reasonable price....and this is it!! I would highly recommend this seat!....Shipment was fast!
2,annoyed,"Okay, the seat looks comfortable but I have not yet been able to install it on my bicycle because the clamping system is totally non-standard. Nowhere was there a picture of the underside of this saddle which would have helped me realize that I will also need a new (straight) seatpost to install this saddle on my bike. So, I'm annoyed. Beware: if you have a flanged seatpost you will need to also purchase a straight seat post to go with this saddle."
4,Very Big Improvement Over Old Seat,"This is for my wife's bicycle, which had a very hard seat with no springs or padding. She likes this seat so far. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is we've only had it for a few weeks and only used it 3-4 times. We have no complaints at this point, it is a big improvement."
4,More comfortable than my old seat,"This seat is definitely more comfortable than my old one. It is not like sitting on a cloud, but I would buy it again. I can ride longer with this seat."
5,Great Comfort at a Great Price,I bought this seat for my granddaughter because of my experience with a Cloud-9 seat I bought a year ago. Both are the most comfortable seats we have ever used. They came from Niagara Cycle which has consistently been top supplier.
4,I saw this at a bicycle shop,Very comfortable seat and is a good value. I had no problem installing the seat and I am very happy with my purchase.
4,"Sunlite Cloud-9, Bicycle Suspension Comfort Saddle, Comfort Gel Ladies, Tri-Color Lycra",Excellent very comfortable I have it several months I use it and do not mind at all does not hurt like the other
2,"Small, but soft seat. Uncomfortable.","The seat is definitely smaller than expected. This was ordered for a stationary bike. It is more comfortable than the Schwinn seat that came with the bike. If you have a big behind, be aware that this will be half the size of the original seat. Maybe we should have ordered the man's and it would have had a larger seat? Summary: softer and more comfortable, but smaller. Wish I could return it for the mens seat. Don't buy this seat!"
4,Great seat. Weird install.,The seat itself is great. Very comfy. The main issue is with the install. The clamp mechanism it uses doesn't clamp down hard enough on the bike seat shaft so you are forced to either super glue it (I did it and it works great) or clamp it with some kind of stick material underneath so it doesn't rotate around.
2,Seat not soft,I ordered this for my wife for use on a stationary bike. The seat was small and much firmer than expected. We returned it.
5,very comfortable for bikers,this is a great bike seat. it is comfortable for those long bike rides. i am not the least bit sore after riding. it is soft and makes the bike ride pleasant
1,Disappointing,This seat is not comfortable as in the description. It is very hard/firm and not what I expected from a gel seat.
1,Pinched nerve...,"This seat gave me a pinched nerve in my right leg after only riding about 5 miles. I tried and tried to keep using it but over and over I'd get the pinched nerve. I think it could be almost too big for me. I'm not super skinny or anything, 5'3"", 145lb. but maybe this is meant for bigger women? Also, make sure you don't buy this seat for a Hybrid or Mountain bike. I read that these seats are really only meant if you are sitting completely upright like on a comfort bike. I also felt that the design was weird. In the middle by the split the seat goes up and that part kinda digs in your butt. Check out the brand Serfas. That is what I bought to replace the cloud 9 and it's much better."
2,Disappointing.,"This book should be retitled: ""Archaeology Checklists for Dummies."" Everything that is in this book can be found for free online. It is disorganized and full of useless information (I should be bringing a backpack with me?-- Thanks! I should be using graph paper and a writing utensil to draw a unit profile?-- Thanks!!) This is not worth $38.00."
4,good,"the delivery was fast, no problem, I ordered the wrong size and had to return them, no problem. A great business to deal with. Never a worry"
5,WOW,Rigby's Roads is a completely captivating story that gave me laughter and tears. It had me curious as to what was going to happen next. A must read for those looking for adventure.
3,philosophy & adventure,"RIGBY'S ROADS is a quest for personal worth. Filled with thrills & spills, humor & evil, liberally dosed with streetwise self-help.Rebeccasreads recommends RIGBY'S ROADS for the sheer fun & catchy philosophies, as well as for an inside scoop into the Harley-Davidson (HOG) lore & legends. 3 stars because it needed editing."
4,Hey Jude? Is that you?,"To answer the query below about who the 'Jude' is in 'Hey Jude' - it is, according to Paul McCartney ...Julian Lennon, John's first child by his ex-wife Cynthia. Paul was driving the young Julian back home at a time when Yoko had appeared on the scene and John and Cynthia's relationship was falling apart. He spontaneously started singing to Julian 'Hey, Jude, don't make it bad...' and the rest was musical history. When he played the song to John Lennon, John thought it was a song about him! Anyway, the sound quality on this album makes 'Hey Jude' and several other tracks really shine - they were all cut from the original master tapes so you really hear the pristine Beatles sound. The inclusion of great rarities like 'The Inner Light' and 'You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)' makes this an essential purchase for Beatles completists - and these albums aren't a bad intro for first-time listeners, either."
5,Past Masters by the Masters,"What do I need to say? Its the Beatles and do we need to question or review their music? Do we need to review Mozart to know it's great? NO! All mini masterpieces.Rain is proto heavy metal,We Can Work It Out is a wonderful,insightful ballad,Paperback Writer a great heavy but melodic rock track,more heavy rock with Revolution(Makes the Stones look like Hermans Hermits! )Wonderful weirdness with You Know My Name,the trippy Inner Light,the song for Julian Hey Jude plus Get Back,Let It Be,Old Brown Shoe,Lady Madonna and Across The Universe! How can you go Wrong? BUY IT NOW!"
4,Try to see things my way.,"This is a collection of previously released Beatles recordings that didn't appear on any of their British albums. Most of the songs are non-LP singles. Most of the songs are great, but the two George Harrison b-sides are somewhat weak (by Beatles standards). My personal favorite Beatles' song is on here (the single version of ""Revolution""). This CD is a must have for Beatles fans."
3,Starts Strong,"In typical Beatles fashion, this album starts strong (Day Tripper, Paperback Writer) and ends weak (Ballad, Brown Shoe, Across the Universe, You Know My Name). The only exception to this was Sgt. Pepper which started strong (Sgt. Pepper) and ended strong (Day in the Life), but getting through the middle was tough. And Magical Mystery Tour which started weak and ended weak.That said, there's enough here for 3-stars, just turn it off before the last 4 or 5 tracks."
4,The Only Decent Beatles Compilation.,"The Beatles are still good but overrated. I have listened to a lot of their albums but this one is the only decent one with allthe good songs in Hey Jude, Ballad Of John And Yoko, and Let It Be. Go get this with a Metallica, Nirvana, Dire Straits, GNR, and Foreigner album today."
3,The only way to get...,"...songs like ""Lady Madonna"" and ""Hey Jude"". Ever since CD re-release eliminated the ""Hey Jude"" album, those two classics are only available here. Until now, the 45-rpm single was the only version of ""Lady Madonna"" I had. People wax nostalgic about those old platters, but let's face it--they were very vulnerable. Especially for the rockingest Beatle song ever."
4,A good Beatles collection.,"The Beatles is very good feel good music. Past Masters Vol 2 has several excellent songs featuring Day Tripper, Hey Jude, Ballad Of John And Yoko, and Revolution. Get this with Foreigner's Fourth Album for beautiful music!"
1,product poorly listed,was not tagged as being for a long water pump in the listing...I needed a pulley for a short water pump.
2,Not Impressed,"This release is for serious fans of Haujobb only. The two new tracks are good (but not great), and the remixes themselves range from O.K. to serious darkwave-tainted crapola. I would not recommend this to the casual haujobb listener - pick up Vertical Theory if you haven't already. ""Polarity"", ""Ninety-nine"", and ""Solutions for a Small Planet"" are all highly recommended."
3,"Great camera, i thought...",I bought this camera a year and a half ago. All was fine. I was delighted with the results. Then the lcd started to flicker and now it has gone white. So thats my camera out of action. I see alot of other people having the same problems. I'd ike to recommend this camera but what lies down the road....I'm so fed up...
2,Great...until it stopped working,"I had my camera for nearly two years until...the LCD screen went black. It worked great during those two years. I took it on tons of trips and got many compliments on the sharp quality of my photos. But it appears that Sony does not make cameras that are built to last, as many other people have had the black LCD screen problem with this camera. I spent nearly $300 on this camera and I was expecting to get at least five years of careful usage out of it. I would not recommend buying this camera, as nearly 90% of the reviewers have had the same problem that I've had. I'm looking for a new camera and I WILL NOT be buying another Sony."
2,Good camera- until it stops working,"I really loved this camera- until the screen recently went black and all pictures came out black as well. I wanted to get another Sony because of the ease of use and decent pics I got (don't like my dad's Olympus camera, have to use the manual just to figure out how to turn it on). However, I read the reviews and found out I had the same problem as many other people. I looked up reviews for other Sony models, and they had problems as well. Guess I won't be getting another Sony.Update- I ended up giving this camera to my fiance. He doesn't mind having to whack the camera a few times whenever the screen goes black. Me, I decided I wanted something that actually worked on a regular basis. I can't help but wonder if people from Sony ever read these reviews, since the black screen is a common problem, not just in this camera but many of their models."
2,for those with black screen problem,"I also have had the black screen experience but I've found that you can temporarily correct the problem most of the time:Reseting the camera by pressing the button located at the bottomStriking the camera against your handFor my camera, I think the problem resides in some bad connections."
1,Do not buy SONY cameras,LSD display went black! I think this will happen with all Sony cameras! I have 2 cameras Sony DSC-P51 and Sony DSC-P72 and both cameras LSD display went black!One after 6 mns and 2nd one after 11 mns.
2,sony p51 cyber shot,"What a disappointment...I've had the camera for 2 years with little use and now it's got a black LCD screen and the pictures are black too. I suspected something was up when the last 15 images all came out way too bright, now it's dead.I followed the instructions and settings procedures to correct the ""Brightness"" but it failed....the biggest bummer, Sony wants $171 to fix it...they don't even know what's wrong with it yet....or do they??? Look at the other reviews."
1,Disappointed Sony Fan..,I bought this Camera 18 months ago in Amazon and barley used it. But now the screen went black.
1,Don't buy it,"One week short of a year and the camera broke. Now, no image appears on the display in any of the 3 picture taking modes and no images are captured. I called the Sony phone number provided and got into a voice menu loop and hung up. When I tried again later it gave me the real person option. The rep was professional, but unsympathetic. For an estimated $147.34 in labor charges they would fix it. Sony online service support said pretty much the same thing only with a --you are talking to the wrong person-- tone. So much for Sony cameras."
1,Junk - Very Frustrating,I too had the screen go black. Until reading reviews here I thought maybe a drop of water got into the LCD and shorted it out. But it sounds like this is a common occurance. I had the camera just short of a year and loved it until the LCD error. Steer clear of it!
1,camera broke down one year from purchase,"I loved this camera until it broke down exactly as described by other reviewers. LCD screen is black in all modes, no photos can be taken. It will cost about $150 to fix, which at this point I do not think is worth it. If I have to purchase another camera, I will definitely not be purchasing a sony!"
1,Notorious Sony breakdown,My first DSC-P51 stopped working within 30 days. Fortunately the store I purchased it from allowed me to simply exchange it. The 2nd one made it just over a year. Now the screen is black in capture mode for still or video. Sony will charge $129 for labor plus any parts not covered by the warranty any longer.I should have learned my lesson when my Sony Mavica stopped working after only 2 years.
2,Major Problem!!!,"I receiveded this camera as a Christmas gift ... and have only had it 5 months. About two weeks ago the microprocessor failed and now I can't take any pictures! There is not a single camera shop in my area that repairs it and I am either going to have to ship it to a repair shop, or ship it directly to Sony, to be repaired...Overall, I am VERY UNIMPRESSED with the reliability of this camera."
2,Black Screen Recalled (finally),"Sony has finally recalled this and other models for the black LCD screen problem. Other models being recalled include those listed here:http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1128703521.htmlTo issue the recall work order, call Sony 1-866-703-7669. I had just gone through the process, and it was rather painless. Hope this helps!"
1,Don't buy this camera...,"I bought this camera about 2 years ago and within 12 months, I had to send it back to Best Buy for repair because the LED screen went black constantly. Thankfully, it was still under warranty at the time. Well, another 12 months passed by and the screen does the same exact thing. If I don't use the flash, it works fine. If I turn the flash on, the screen goes black and I have to whack the camera to get it to function again. Sony will fix it -- for $100. No thanks. I've written my letter of complaint to Sony and vow never to buy their crappy products again."
1,Yet another black screen victim...,"My camera has also died. Yes, a black screen within the two year time frame...I shall be avoiding Sony products from now on! As an aside, if vendors are going to make ""disposable"" products (in this case it is cheaper to buy a new camera than repair this one), then I will only be paying ""disposable"" prices in future."
1,black screen,I have had the same problem with the black screen as many others had. I loved the product until the black screen problem. Sony is no help what so ever and just recommend service for $130. I would never buy another sony camera.
2,The infamous Black LCD display,The LCD on my camera has also gone black. It would cost me over $140.00 to fix and I don't think it's worth it. I am very disappointed with Sony. I didn't even get 2 years of good service with the DSC-P51. I will never get another SONY product.
5,All I wanted,What I like about this camera the most is the fact that you can hook it right up to your TV and review the pictures that you just took for all to enjoy.
2,Sony DSC-P51 - you can do much better,"Sony is famous for it's products breaking down just before the warranty ends and this is no exception. This camera suddenly started flashing a code of E:61:10 and the focus stopped working. To fix it will cost about $170 and is not covered by the warranty (there are scratches on the camera so they assume you dropped it - I didn't). On another note, the included 4 mb memory stick is too low. You have to buy a separate 128 mb stick to take a decent number of photos (Lexar sells one for about $50 that worked fine). If you want a digital camera, save a little more money and get at least a 3 or 4 megapixel and please MAKE SURE YOUR NEW CAMERA IS NOT A SONY if you want it to work longer than a few months!!"
5,Love It,It does what I want it to do which is take good digital pixs. The price is right and it's easy to use.
2,Incompatible,"So far I am very unhappy with my DSC P51. I like the set-up and quality of the camera itself, but I have had plenty of trouble downloading pictures and the Sony technical help has been adversarial and condescending.We bought our Sony when we had a Windows 98 computer and were able to download our pictures. The USB port on that computer fried so we got a new desktop with Windows XP. The camera was not recognized so we called Sony. After trying 10 different things with a tech guy he told us it was our computer's fault. We got on the phone with Dell, who told us it was Sony's fault (of course).I borrowed my father's Kodak, plugged it in and it worked fine! I've now been on the phone with Sony for 1.5 hours (and counting) explaining the problem. At each step I've been told there are sometimes problems with hardware.... So what! Fix it! Finally got a manager that says it's never happened with this camera. Once again so what! They've presented no solutions or options!"
2,"yes, another black screen","I purchased this camera in November 2002. For almost 2 years it functioned perfectly, then about 6 weeks ago, I suddenly had a black screen. It is now in for repair for the black screen problem for the third time in 6 weeks. Fortunately, I purchased a 4 year extended warranty policy, and it hasn't cost me for the attempted repairs. I didn't know the problem could be corrected by whacking the camera! However, under the extended warranty no lemon policy, after this 3rd attempt to fix the problem, I will be able to get a full purchase price credit towards a new camera of my choice. (Thanks Best Buy). I will stick with the Sony because I have the extra memory sticks, but I will definately buy the extended warranty again."
2,Another black LCD screen problem,"I have owned this camera for 2 years (paid $280) and was well pleased with it until about 10 days ago. Then the LCD screen went black and pictures were black.After reading several reviews today from camera owners with the same black screen problem, I gave my camera a couple of whacks to the left side. Presto!The camera started working, the LCD screen came on and I was able to take pictures and review them. Thanks to the reviewers who mentioned hitting the camera.Until today, I dreaded the thought of having to purchase another camera after only 2 years use. I have too much invested in memory sticks, Nimh batteries, & a reader. I just hope it continues to work. Sony should recognize the fact that this camera (DSC-P51) definitely has a problem.Overall when it worked, I was pleased with its easy to use features, giving it 5 stars. Now I will have to give it 2 stars not knowing what the camera will do."
1,baking cakes,I was disappointed in this book. It had some wonderful cakes but just a little to advanced for my experience. I will try some of them but it will take awhile to master these techniques. Definetly not for a beginning baker or decorator.
5,cake decorating,"what a great resource book, great ideas for cakes of all sorts. Take all the ideas or just bits and pieces. A truly fun book to inspire."
5,Love the cake Designs,An enjoyable and helpful/handy book to have. Would recommend even for a beginner as it helps with design and technique.
4,Very Good,One of the better choices in cake decorating. Have had alot of fun with this book and is great for anyone who likes to decorate cakes.
2,Not A Book For Beginners,"I loved the pictures in this book, great cakes, but I'm a beginning cake decorator, several cakes in this book seemed a little difficult to me, besides the pictures, didn't really care for this book at all. ""The Essential Guide To Cake Decorating"" was a lot better for me!!!"
2,Not the best!,The best cake in the book is on the cover - but it isn't in the actual book!!The designs of the other cakes are either plain or very eccentric with wire swirls etc coming out of them.I wouldn't pay alot for this book - try to have a look inside one before purchasing.
3,Well written.,This book is well written and easy to follow. I was expecting a book with all styles of cakes. These cakes only had the fondant instructions. Also disappointed because the cake recipes are all for girl cakes. I have 3 boys so this book is basically useless when baking a cake for a boy.
5,Struggles,"This book is essential to study the Russo-German conflict. Yes Paul Carrell is biased to the German side, understandable as a veteran of WW2, but he has put together a solid and most readable effort. He adds a personal face to the battle, a story not only told on the grand scale of battle, but also of the smaller things, like a soldier's long journey back to his own lines. The story is told slightly out of sequence, mainly to show what was the turning point of these two years(Kursk) and then tells the story from beginning to end. It is well worth the investment of time. The book has pictures of varying quality but the maps are excellent."
4,Detailed but biased,"An incredibly detailed depiction of the battle strategies and,especially, the tactics on the Eastern Front during the two decisive years of WWII. Readers should be aware, however, that the story is told largely from the German army's point of view. Russian tactics are given matter-of-factly, while German action is described as ""brave"", ""courageous"", ""gallant"", and so forth. The sub-title of the book, ""The Russan-German War"" would have better been given as ""The German War in Russia""."
3,TorpanInternational,"This book is an important historical reference to part of WW2 in regards of the war Germany v Russia,particularly from the German side.Therfore it refrains to mention ,much about the atrocities commited by the Germans.Factual the atrocities were commited by both sides---it was a brutal war.However, it is a good reference."
5,BEST BOOK ON WW 2 I EVER READ!,"I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 2000 BOOKS IN MY PERSONAL COLLECTION. OVER 200 ARE ON WORLD WAR TWO. NONE ARE AS GOOD AS THE BOOKS BY PAUL CARELL. THIS SPECIFIC BOOK WILL KEEP YOU UP LATE AT NIGHT AND ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT WITH SUSPENSE, EXCITEMENT AND UTTER AMAZEMENT. THE AUTHOR COVERS SOLDIERS ON BOTH SIDES WITH GREAT RESPECT AS SOLDIERS. HE FREQUENTLY COMPLIMENTS THE COURAGE, TENACITY, HEROISM AND FIGHTING SKILL OF THE RUSSIANS. YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER BOOK TO READ ON WORLD WAR TWO."
4,"Good book, bad paper","Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It gives a good behind-the-scenes feel for the strategies, the battles and the bitter struggles that went on between Hitler and his generals.On the down side it is printed on heavy, glossy paper that is sometimes difficult to read for long periods of time."
5,Splendid!!!!!!!!!!!!!,One of my brothers from church //allowed me to enjoy this///since then// I have made a few purchases of the cd and the dvd //This is a superb dvd//WOW!!!!!!!!!!! i love it and will share with others.
5,Three Mo Tenors,"Our entire family loves this production. These men are diversely gifted with a delivery style that is totally polished.We have enjoyed watching it together and sharing it with friends.It is clearly the most requested CD in our home.We have laughed at their humor and cried when reminded of how insensitive our nation has been to the African-American race, when in fact they have always had so much to give.This DVD has established a love and respect in our children (10 & 8) which we pray will follow them as they continue to grow in our racist society. We have been blessed beyond measure and have given Three Mo Tenors DVD's to numerous friends. We and our children have thanked God for them on many occasions during their daily prayers. Praise Him from whom ALL blessings flow."
5,Remarkable and Original,"This doesn't get any better - unless you see and hear ""Cook Dixon & Young Volume 1"" - the 2nd album by these three unbelievable gentlemen! The original 3 mo' tenors are now singing and have been singing under their own names. Don't let any other advertisement throw you! If you see an album called ""Three Mo Tenors"" it is Cook Dixon & Young. If you see a concert featuring ""3 Mo tenors"" it is NOT Cook Dixon & Young. These men are incredible, versatile, and touch your soul like no other. A treasure!"
5,"Ladies and Gentleman, Children of all ages...","RUN! Don't walk to get your copy of Three Mo' Tenors.You won't be disappointed. This is entertainment at it's very best! If you can't go out to see them live in concert do the next best thing. Bring them home to you! Treat yourself to a glorious evening of outstanding talent. Backed by richly orchestrated music, these men are singing everything, I mean EVERYTHING from Opera to Blues and back. Three Mo' Tenors has something for eveyone. A wonderful introduction to classical music for children of all ages. I beg you don't ""Let the good times roll"" pass you and yours. BUY the VHS or DVD and experience the fun and laughter, the JOY! Bring home the MAGIC that is Three Mo Tenors!"
5,MY KINDA GUYS!,"Dixon Trent and Young are alright. Trent, I am familiar with from the Leiber and Stoller show. The other guys are new to me. But each one holds his own. It took me three tries and eight months to order this. I am finally glad to get it. And it is a delight. Something else to turn my children on to."
4,a lot mo' fun than the originals,"Unrestricted pleasure . At 87 and counting, Minnie the Moocher brought back fond memories and Try to Remember, while still ridiculously sudsy, makes me want to. Will there be mo'?"
4,Great Music,"I use Three Mo Tenors in my Humanities class to introduce Opera and to my Contemorary Fine Arts classes to demonstrate diversity. It begins with an aria getting the 'Three Tenors' treatment which morphs into various exciting forms of more accessible music like soul, MoTown, gospel, jazz, and blues. These guys are the real deal. Students realize it and generally accept the different forms of music that are so masterfully executed. There is even a touching rendition of ""Nothing's Going to Harm You"" from Sweeney Todd. The secret is to prepare the students to be bored by Opera so that you let them discover the surprize."
5,A Must Have Video,I don't like opera but the talent of these three men have made it well worth listening to. I highly recommend this video for anyone who enjoys a variety of music. I highly recommend this to the African American community (especially the teens) because these tenors demonstrate that we don't have to limit ourselves to just one or two forms of music (rap and hip hop). The quality of the video and the professionalism of the singers is above reproach and worth watching over and over again (as I have done already). The talent is so awesome that I will be seeing them perform live shortly. I'm looking forward to it. Awesome video!
5,Three Mo' Fabulous,"I puchased the CD, and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD. It seemed to me that the quality of the recording comes through even better on the DVD, but that may be because their expression adds great dimension to their performance. These three gentlemen are truly technical craftsmen that make everything they sing come alive no matter what the genre. A must have that you will enjoy viewing again and again."
2,Nipple too bulky,"Newborn nipple? Right! My baby choked and gagged on this nipple, and the milk ran down his face. He is doing slightly better on it now, and he is 4 months old. He preferrs the J&J Healthflow bottles which have a smaller nipple."
1,"avant bottles leak, big headache","my son had no problems with the nipple or the shape of the bottle (holding it in his little hands). however, this bottle leaks and it's a nightmare to deal with. as another reviewer wrote, you turn it too much and it leaks, you turn it too little and it leaks.i can't count the number of times the milk leaked from under the cap over his face, neck and clothing. in the middle of the night,it's even more of a headache. i wrote to avent about this problem and i'm sure they have received other complaints. they should have recalled these bottles...if the product does not work in the way it's supposed to, ie. feed your child in a clean, effective, safe manner, then it should not be on the market for people to purchase."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype....,"Everyone says the best bottles are the Avent ones. I haven't found that to be true. My son never liked this one, and I've tried giving it to him a few times. Thankfully I only bought one to try out, so I didn't invest a lot of money. We just ended up buying the regular old Gerber ones--in the pretty colors of course (you can buy at least 6 for what 1 Avent bottle costs). I'll admit we never used the nipples that came with the Gerber bottles, but instead bought the silicone, ortho ones because they were the only ones my son seemed to be able to handle. I did buy some Avent ""sippy cup"" tops to replace the nipple since they will fit on this bottle, so we'll see how my son takes to those (maybe the bottle won't be a total loss)."
4,The Edible Landscape,"If you live in Florida and like to grow your own food, this is the book to have. MacCubbin gives plenty of useful information for growing every fruit and vegetable one can grow in Florida. He provides helpful tips for each. I particularly find the month-by-month growing guide extremely useful. He even gives hints on growing exotics. I have recommended or bought this book for all of my Florida gardening friends."
4,I have 2 different night visions.......,"You can use up alot of batterries if you use the Infared on it and leave the green light on alot.Both at the same time can use alot of juice.I made my own infared from a latern and using filters of red and colbalt blue or just red.It will light up and large area and look like day light thru green glasses.I am talking 200 yards in the darkness.You can not use this in a city or town in most cases too much light but at night in the woods you can light up the night and see all the creatures,some scary,some not so.I hunt at night and found them to be a valueable tool in finding hogs.While waiting you see all knids of other things too but you have to do it spareingly or you eat up your battery fast.It's hefty,soft to the touch,nice lenses,flimsy strap for what you pay for it.Never dropped so don't know about if it's tuff enough,had mine for about 2 years."
1,"DON'T BUY, IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP","I was anticipating this night vision monocular to be great. I was really excited and anxious to get it. When I did, I almost puked with regret.First of all, it's heavy and bulky, absolutely not comfortable to carry around for a long time. Second, the viewfinder is so small, it seems you're watching through a straw, LITERALLY. Third, it's almost impossible to focus on something. The central focal point is so small that everything around it blurs drastically. Fourth, the minimum focal distance is about 6 feet, anything closer doesn't focus at all.Bottom line, paying $200 to look through a straw where everything is blurry sucks.The worst buy i've done in years (and I've shopped a bunch). Seriously, I've never written a bad review on anything because I didn't think it was worth it. There's always a first. PLEASE DON'T BUY, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER."
4,Excellent Summary of Tamil Struggle,"Mr. Swamy has done an admirable job in describing the early days of the Sri Lankan tragedy. I would have liked more insight into the Tamil leader Prabhakaran's mind (like maybe with an interview.) Though the epilogues give a very brief updating of the conflict after 1990, more info on LTTE's efforts to obtain legitimacy internationally since then would have been nice. But that's nitpicking - Swamy's book is a definite must-read for anyone interested in this 20 year old civil war. I also recommend ""Only Man is Vile"" (McGowan) for a more personal perspective."
3,A good aide for English & Tagalog speakers.,"Vocabulearn Tagalog comes with two audio-cassette tapes and a booklet. What you will hear is the voice of the English speaker and then the Tagalog one. The sections mostly contain one words, however there are sections devoted to short phrases. One drawback to this is that somewhere in the tape, the voices change order and that make things really confusing. Keep in mind that you cannot learn the language alone with this, but this should supplement your studies."
5,wonderful watch,"Finally, I found a watch that fits my small wrist. I don't have to worryabout this watch falling off my wrist."
3,interesting,This was my least favorite of the three books in this series but it was not a bad read. The use of poison as the murder weapon and the method of delivery to the victims was creative.
5,Great Techniques,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the cardigan in the DVD is not to my taste but the DVD focuses very little on the design and knitting of the sweater. Instead, this DVD centers primarily around the techniques of cardigans including steeking, finishing edges, neck and front button bands, etc. If you have never steeked before or would like to see some expert tips demonstrated, this is an excellent reference!"
5,Abracadabra,Finally! Magic explained for the ordinary mortal. That is; stage magic. If you can fight off a balrog or lead an army of eagles after watching said tape i'll personally eat it! Never the less a fine tape that leaves a lot of fellow magicians bristling! Especially recommended for the initiate; so you can see what you're getting into (or out of).
2,New package,Until recently it was the best shampoo I've ever tried. And I've been looking for the right shampoo for a long time. My hair was falling out and this shampoo helped me from the 1st time I used it. Recently Nature's gate changed the packaging and the whole product. I kept buying it but it's not the same anymore. I will have to say good-buy to nature's gate and start my search again.
4,very good,"initial reading of the track list was quite disappointing, as there are so many covers, but i think the quality of her own work makes up for this, i was an alex fan from the beginning of fame academy even though i am very cynical of ""talent shows"", but i think this album really is beautiful, and hope that there are more brilliant albums to follow,"
3,Hmmm,"This album should have been very good with good or interesting covers (except a poor rendition of Everybody Hurts - a song which should should not in my opinion be covered). Instead it comes acropss as quite bland. I was exepting emotional punch like Sinaed O Conner, I got a mild wimper of an artist who still has a lot of growing to do. Having said this Alex's Voice is very good and far above the average pop fodder that is around thses days. The album did not disuade me from buying her next release but I hope it will fulfil expectation...Perhaps some duets would have livened up the album a little and many of the tracks just seem far to short and the album never fully gets into its stride."
3,Worthwhile - I would buy this again.,"The selections evince that the hurdy gurdy was an instrument taken seriously by early composers through Vivaldi and Mozart. The performances are able, but lacking real fire. Maybe more of the hurdy gurdy's sublime nature could have been brought out? The liner notes are useful and provide a decent overview of the instrument's history. Overall, a well done disc, but certainly not essential."
5,nice product,"These are very nice, but longer than I had expected. I don't know how they can sell them at such a discount, but I am not complaining."
4,"RECONDITIONED, NO WAY. HAVE TO EXAM IT FIRST","Cann,t believe I bought anything without really examining it first. It came within a week and I asked a man to come over to put it together. While I waited for him, I put it together myself. I think its great except I am disappointed it doesn't have the dirt alert sensor. My friend has it on hers.Very happy with everthing else.Vacuuned 2 days before it came and did it again when I got it. Couldn't believe all the AZ. sand it picked up. If I could order another one for the same price I would get one for my Mother."
4,Holy cow! Beyond my expectations!,"I was nervous about the vacuum being ""factory-reconditioned"", but mine arrived in 3 business days looking and working as if it were a brand-new vacuum. Although I'm technically challenged, I was able to put it together in a few minutes and test it out right away. This vacuum proved that it was time to ditch my old one: the canister (no bags--yippee!) filled up before I finished the room and it was freaky yet fascinating to see everything my old vacuum had missed. Remotely negative features: Aside from the extension wand, there are only 2 on-board tools (duster/brush, crevice) and the hose to do above-the-floor cleaning is a bit heavy. And although I love that it's bagless, the canister needs to be emptied more frequently (than a bag vacuum) and it's a dirty process. Overall I'm really happy with this vacuum and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great vacuum for a great price."
1,NOT PLEASED,I WROTE A GOOD REPORT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. NOW AFTER A FEW MONTHS I HAVE NEEDED A NEW MOTOR AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BUY FILTERS.I WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE ELSE TO GET ONE
5,a tribute to the poetry writing process in general,a glimpse into 'claude's life' leaves one reeling at the genius of edward t. george's creative faculties and wanting more!
3,"The Letter, Not the Spirit","A disappointment. Kaufman gets the facts, but misses the spirit. To be sure, any biographer of Ludlam is up against a lot. The main problem is that a lot of the man's art existed ""at the vanishing point,"" that is to say, in performance. Ludlam was above all, an inspired actor, and acting (HIS acting) and style took precedence over everything (he gave the world no great plays, and his company consisted of weak, noncompetive actors). Capturing a performance in words is very difficult, and Kaufman has no aptitude for it. Further,he is too much the fan. Though he acknowledges all of CL's personal and professional faults, his admiration always guides the direction of the book and we never quite get the man whole, or any explanation of why we should admire him. The most one can say is that Kaufman has gathered the information necessary for others to assess Ludlam's quality and his contribution to theatre."
4,Liquid Oxygen Works!,This product is affordable and does the job. I noticed an immediate difference in my energy level. Great product and I will continue to use it.
3,Nice Love Story About Paul and Linda,"I like other reviewers felt that the video ""WINGSPAN"" was more about how he and Linda moved forward with their lives after the Beatles.After reading the book ""Linda McCartney: An Itimate Portrait"" I understood why the ""Wingspan"" video was the way it was. They did not delve much into the band, because honestly the only imput Paul really cared about was Linda's. In the book it was even intimated that it was an ""US"" (Paul and Linda) and then THEM(the band).Great for a marriage, not great for a band.Paul also does not go into why these musicians quite. The fact was they were not getting paid what they felt they deserved.And when two musicians went to Scotland to practice with them (and brought their wives), Linda told them that the wives should leave as this was business. Hmmm...wonder what Paul would have said if someone told him to leave Linda home."
5,Very Nice,"More than just the story of a band, this is Paul and Linda's love story, and a great one it is. I would highly recommend this DVD to all of Paul's fans."
5,Wings,"Wings was a great group, of course. I'm glad to have the DVD. I recieved it fast and in great shape."
5,The perfect picture book of the Burgess Shale fossils.,"If you've read""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""The Crucible of Creation,"" this is the perfect pictorial companion. The photographs are superb, and are accompanied by drawings which really help put it all together. I never completely understood what the other authors meant when they said that the fossils where well preserved. Now I see what that means. Photos such as the one of Vauxia are astounding examples of preservation to say nothing of Olenoides. The photo of Aysheaia looks like a beautiful petroglyph. The descriptions help too. You can actually see where the inner organs lie in many examples once they are pointed out by the author. This a book for anyone curious about the Cambrian. It is so detailed that it can also be an inspiration for designers who are looking for a different theme. Highly recommended!"
2,Don't be misled by the title!,"Folks, this is a *nice* little article about how to outsource your corporate instructional design. It's all of 3 pages long and was originally published in Training & Development magazine. You wouldn't know that from reading any of the descriptive text about this particular PDF offering."
4,Great light reader!,I'm in school right now and love books that don't require thought but do let me get lost in them! This book is just like that and that's a good thing! It really sucks you in and transports you to the world of Alias!!!
4,"Collateral Damage Fascinating, Yet Errors Bring It Down","As a die hard fan of Alias I was impressed by the book as a whole, but I also noticed parts of the story that did not correspond with the show. First of all in the book it is mentioned that Sydney killed Alison Doren but she was actually unsuccessful in her attempts and Alison Doren actually met her demise at the hands of Will Tippin. Secondly, the book refers to Milo Rambaldi as Carlos Rimbaldi. Rambaldi is such a big part of the show that it is ridiculous that his name is mentioned incorrectly. There were also typos (not the author's fault) which kind of broke my concentration. others than these few little nit picks, the story was as exciting as an episode of Alias, in fact if this story was an episode Jennifer Garner would be a shoo in for the Lead Actress Emmy."
5,Ponies & Christmas & Grandpa's--A Kid's Delightful Story!,"This will touch many of all ages with its takeoff of the infamous flock of birds and the barn story.Here, developed in tale of horse named Mint and its use by God to allow Grandpa to realize the truth about the Christmas season, that in Christ God came to earth from heaven above to be our Savior.The story is well-written with focus on children listeners and readers. The art is just delightful and very well done.Wonderful gift for your own kids, grandkids."
3,good bang for a buck,"This is a fine recording,I can't seem to find on the package who the choir is,and Amazon has mixed up the songs so that if you play them online,you get the wrong song. But it is a nice recording including a couple of carols you don't normally hear,so it is well worth the $2.99 cost,especially with delivery included. A nice recession classical carol CD. Enjoy."
3,"Not bad, but...","The plot is promising while the dialogue stumbles. The acting, with the exception of the understated but well-executed performance by Sean Matic, is strained but not not entirely unpalatable. The story treats the subject of hustling with some sensitivity: the guy has been more or less driven to doing it by virtue of being an illegal alien and unable to find other ready employment, and he is treated sympathetically. The cinematography is acceptable. It's an entertaining 84 minutes but not a film I would add to my own collection. The bar is set a bit lower for this genre so true masterpieces are rare. All the same, it's worth a viewing, and avid collectors of gay-themed indie films would not be disappointed."
2,"bad acting, boring, another hustler movie",The only good thing are the actors..not for good acting but for hot!! Really handsome guys
4,"good film, bad acting","Actually the premise of this film would earn 5 stars, but the acting was so bad I did have a difficult time in getting through it. Watching it a second time allowed me to pay attention to the script more and it was well worth the second viewing. The acting, unfortunately, did not got any better."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,"Talk about terrible acting, terrible sets, terrible story lines, terrible story all together. This movie might have had a chance... nope, it doesnt.First, the Australian Escort had this constant saying of ""no worries"" which seemed so fake. The entire movie seemed fake, funny that someone is saying that about a movie.No dragging you in, no interest, no nothing. Story lines did not follow, and again, THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE! NO ONE SHOULD EVER BUY THIS MOVIE."
1,Laughable,"Yet another movie that gives gay-themed movies a bad rep, this one is an embarrassment. The dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. The acting is comparable to what one might expect to see in a porno flick, which this is not, of course. The writer/director takes pride in stating his belief that ""nudity is only a distraction,"" but I doubt if even nudity could have helped this movie since only one of the actors (Ames) has any sex appeal whatsoever (keep your shirt on, Sean). The writer/director says he had intended to cast gay men in the leading roles but that the straight actors he chose were the best actors of those he auditioned. Maybe so, but the actor selected to play the hustler is miscast, for it seems unlikely that this hustler could command $1000 for an all-night stay. Another bit of miscasting is the actress who plays the part of the hustler's girlfriend -- she looks more like his mother. This movie has nothing to recommend it."
2,Unsatisfying and Rough,"The tag line for this film is ""sexy, quirky, and moving."" Well, it's sexy, and it's certainly quirky, but it isn't moving. At all.The acting in this film is some of the worst I've seen, even if graded on a ""curve"" for independent films with ""gay content""; this one is bad. Unfortunately it's so bad that it actually distracts you from the story.The story, on the other hand, isn't terrible. The ""premise has promise,"" but it's mostly an empty promise here, when all the main characters (and even the secondary, barely-there, don't-care-about-them characters) suddenly and inexplicably see the error of their ways and change. If only it were that easy.The characters are certainly sexy, and there is enough eye candy here to maintain some interest among all the ""acting"" and ""story.""The package here, that is, the sum of the parts, isn't much. There are a lot better films than this to see first."
1,The American,"Very boring film actors seemed to be bored with their roles, left me to wander and not want to watch it again!"
2,"Earnest but bad (almost so bad it's good, but not quite)","I saw this film recently. It generated a lot of laughter from the audience, but - generally - this was laughter for all the wrong reasons.All of the actors are sort of porn star good looking and, sadly, have a commensurate acting ability. In particular the actor with the awful ""Australian"" accent is particularly wooden. The story is pretty boring, although there are a few witty one liners and almost amusing situations, but overall this is just not a very good film. It's not even bad enough to be in the category of so bad it's good.I really wonder how films like this can get made - and more than that I wonder why they generally get so many glowing reviews on Amazon - are all the positive reviews by friends and relatives of the filmmakers?"
2,Lost Touch,"I've used Calendar Creator since it first came out and it was a wonderful product until taken over by the big software companies. Not only has it become more difficult to install and use, technical support has fallen to the worst I've had experience to use. The older versions would allow you to print horizontal half-page calendars which allowed for more room for daily comments. I've called technical support several time to try to work this out in versions 7 & 8 with no response. If it does it, they won't tell you. What's the alternative? I haven't found one yet."
1,Gets worse with every version,"The Calendar Creator 9 packaging lists among features: ""Save as HTML, Bitmap or JPEG."" After you install it, you find that this feature is available only in the Deluxe Edition. I can't get CC9 (or CC8) to print correctly in PCL or Postscript. I didn't have these problems in the early versions."
2,Disappointing Upgrade,"I upgraded this from version 7. I found MANY bugs in printing, saving and default preference option saving. This version of the software was trully an un-remarkable upgrade and Version 7 was actually more stable and actually worked more then not. In version 9 I can not print the graphics without jagged edges on either Postscript or PCL/6 printers. User preference options keet resorting to the default setting, Constant advertisements and popup screens even after registering and logging on to the Web site. Over all a HUGH dissappointment."
1,I Wish I Had My Money Back,"I bought this program (Deluxe 9 version) because the description said it would be compatible with my Palm Pilot. It might be. I don't think I'll ever know because I cannot get the program to install with Windows XP. I've spent hours trying to solve the problem, including serving time at Broderbund's technical support site. So far, I've had no luck. Worse still, it seems to conflict with another of Broderbund's products on my computer, PrintMaster. It sounded so appealing but I think this program is going to end up in my junk heap. Save yourself time and money; don't buy this."
1,Major Disappointment,"I've used Calendar Creator Plus (Win 95 and Win 3.1) for years on my XP computer. Recently, I had major problems so I purchased version 9 because I'd read the dismal reviews of subsequent versions. It was a total waste of money because it cannot print a Month At a Glance calendar on facing pages properly. The old version had no problems with this, as well as having many more font colors available. I managed to reinstall my old version of Calendar Creator Plus successfully and am happily using it. I believe this must have been the LAST version of this useful product to ever work properly! I have no interest in pictures, etc., only wanting to produce an electronic calendar that monitors all my standing and new appointments with readable text in my specified format. When Softkey had the product it worked; it hasn't worked properly since. Broderbund has turned it into a real ripoff. What a shame! I wouldn't even give it one star, but can't unclick the one that's there.Toby"
5,BELLS BEAUTIFUL BELLS,"Jacques Lannoy plays a wonderful selection of pieces on this CD. The AIR POUR TROMPETTES by Mouret (Theme from Masterpice Theatre) is especially interesting and entertaining. LE TAMBOURIN by Rameau... very precise and melodious. A mostly French programme, but the exciting sound of bells will get you going. And humming. And singing. Oh, the sound of bells..."
5,very good item,very nice engine part very happy with it arrived fast and as i expected but it also ran throuh custums and got no problems with it
3,Good Toilet Reading.,I tried reading this book cover to cover and ended up putting it down. It's a good book to flip through while sitting around or taking a dump. Sid would've wanted it that way.
5,A Book for Every Company's Holiday List,"I have read plenty of business books from the latest authors - Collins, Buckingham, Godin, etc.. But Cause for Success is BY FAR the most inspiring, practical and thought provoking business book that I have ever read. This book shatters myths that ethical businesses can't be highly profitable, and raises the bar for the entire business community. It makes you think twice about how to run your company, and plan more wisely for the future. It will help you make better business decisions. DON'T MISS THIS!"
5,Cause for Success is Nautilus 2005 Award Winner!,"Cause for Success recently won FIRST place for ""Best Business Book"" at the Nautilus 2005 Awards ceremony that honored books that contribute significantly to conscious living and positive social change.According to the editors at Marilyn McGuire & Associates, Inc., the company that hosted the awards: ""There is hardly a wasted word in this succinct homage to ten corporate exemplars who prove that ""conscious business"" is not an oxymoron. These high-purpose companies are changing the face - and the principles - of standard business practice with a diversity of commitments to ethics, partnership, economic justice, environmental wisdom, and service to a greater good. In a world of rampant corporate malfeasance, it's heartening to know that companies with a soul do exist, and are thriving because of it."""
5,very sharp,very sturdy and well worth the money. Need to order the sheath now as it did not come with the machete.
5,Jungle Machete,"When I saw that this machete was used by the military to clear jungle growth, it sold me. I decided that a machete can easily slip from your hands while hacking away so in the interest of my safety as well as a helper , I did want the handle. A yard that resembles a jungle is waiting for me!"
1,Poor choice,"This is not very well made, not sharp and very unbalanced. I would definately not recommend. Buyer beware, look for a different solution."
3,"Well-researched, but translation only fair","This book has much to offer but I would not recommend its use in the classroom - - high school or university. The presentation is tedious and at times frustrating. It would, however, be a welcome addition to a library shelf."
3,Overall a good watch...,"If you buy this movie hoping it treads new horror territory, you're in for a dissapointment. There's nothing here that you haven't seen or heard before. Nevertheless, the movie is anchored by solid performances, a good pace and an interesting plot that has a few twists and turns that actually make sense. Overall it's pretty good.The extras and behind the scenes footage are very good."
1,Overrated,"I think Sinead's terrific, I think The Lion & The Cobra is amazing, and I think Troy might be her most powerful song. But, for the most part, her emotion is absent from these remixes. These tracks are a great disservice to Sinead's Troy as well as the reputations of the remixers. If you have The Lion & The Cobra, you're all set. If not, buy it!"
1,"formulaic rote club ""music""","For the most part these remixes lack even an ioata of the originality, creativity or spark of the original song. They represent just about the worst of current ""club music"" and why that genre is dying a painful death.I can't imagine fans getting into these mixes much and most DJ's would probably find these mixes no different from 100s of others spat out in the past 5 or 6 years. Avoid."
5,"A gift for a lover of puzzles,","This was a gift for my wife who is a lover of puzzles. She very much enjoys coming home from work, shifting gears from work mode to relaxing and completing a puzzle. She loves the picture, light house, clouds, full moon, ocean waves and the challenge of the 1000 pieces."
1,sent wrong nipples then wanted me to ship them back at my expense,"this product is a good one, but the seller shipped me the wrong nipples, not the ones advertized, (I wanted the cereal nipples which are a #3), I notified him of the error, he told me it was a mistake in the description and to ship them back to him at MY expense and he would replace them. Needless to say I didnt, I just went out and bought the correct nipples. Unsatisfied with this transaction, as well as a few other internet transactions."
5,Avent is the best for our baby,Our baby seems to really like the Avent products; have tried other brands that we had received at our baby shower and they didn't work out. These nipples are no exception. Feedings go a bit faster now. I love the interchangeability of Avent bottles/accessories.
2,"Description says BPA-Free, but packaging does not (as all the others do)","I ordered 3 different kinds of these and all said they were BPA Free (or 0% BPA) in the description and when they arrived the other two boldly stated in a bright green circle that they did not contain BPA, except this one. I know they made some before the BPA thing became popular so they may be trying to dump their inventory. I returned it just to be safe(r)."
5,Nice...,My 9 month old daughter has no problems with these nipples which we have been using for 3 months or so. They are fairly easy to clean. I think they were a great purchase and I would recommmend to anyone.
3,Not sized for all Avent bottles,"I bought these to put on a few Avent bottles a friend gave to me, but they don't fit properly.The nipple is the same size as the neck of the bottle, but I can't screw the ring on around it.This nipple has an extra lip of silicone that wraps around the bottle edge--which would seem to ensure a good seal--but maybe the bottle is older and the ring is sized for a less bulky nipple.In any event, I can't use them currently but will probably get more bottles as my baby grows.Can't comment on the flow or use of them at this point."
5,Love it,"I love the avent items. These are dishwasher safe, top rack only. They wash well and we use them every day."
4,Avent Newborn Flow Nipple,"This nipple is really good. I got my first ones with the 4oz bottles in a set I got for my shower. We tried it with my baby during her 1st months and she actually liked the nipple thought at first it seems the 1 hole flows fast thank she could take but eventually, she caught up with it. She's still using this nipple until now that she's 4 months old since the 2 holes seems to fast for her still. We bought two packs of this to use for our other avent bottles and they all go through sterilization daily and each nipple gets used around 3 times a day. And after 4 months of use and sterilization, they still look like new. So i'm really impressed with the quality. I like that its has engraved markings too on two sides of the nipple so its easier to see the number so i don't confuse it with the other 2 hole nipples i've got. I've had my baby try other nipples and bottles and avent bottles and nipples has been her favorite."
5,Great nipple for thicker liquids,"Our son has reflux and the dr told us to try the formula that has rice in it, so we did. However the nipples we had were 1 as hes only 6 wk old, and the formula would not come out. We then tried the 2 and same problem. We tried to make the holes bigger but still wouldnt come out. So we bought these and they work wonderfully. All of the numbers seem to come out fast but he hasnt choked on it yet, and finishes his bottle fast. He has not been fussy with these either. Avent-this was ingenious. Just a pain that they dont have these in stores!"
4,Rubber easily rips,"These nipples lasted about 6 months before the rubber started to rip. I've had to replace about half of them because the tip where the holes are ripped and now there's just a gaping rubber flap. But despite the need to periodically replace them, they are a good nipple and I haven't had any other issues with them."
5,Did the trick,"I live in an area where it's hard to find anything. Every store had stages 2 and 3, but I had a hard time finding the size 1. It did come fast and do the job. I only wish I was able to use the coupons I had!"
2,Didn't work as well as expected,I was a bit disappointed with this nipple. I love the concept but it just didn't work. It was too fast no matter which direction it was positioned and I ended up with a huge mess every time I tried it.
3,Works for a month...,"Worked fine at first but after about a month caused the bottle to leak. Switching to the medium flow stopped the leak, but we suspect the same will happen. We have one Born Free bottle and it hasn't ever leaked."
1,leaking,"one of the nipple has some manufacturing defect and cause milk leakage during feeding,which is so irritating."
4,definitely let air out of bottle (vs into baby),"These nipples definitely let the air out of the bottle (vs into my baby) - I can hear it escaping. And he's less likely to suck the nipples flat like he's now doing with other brands (Medela & Dr Brown's). However, sometimes when I put the bottle together it leaks. (I never had this problem with the Medela bottles.) So pros and cons, but overall very good."
3,would get the variable flow nipples instead,"I love all the avent products so far but in the future I think I would just order the newborn nipples and then the variable flow nipples. My son used the newborn initially but by the time he was a month or two old, the slow flow nipples were already too slow for him. Each baby is different so some of this is trial and error, but the variable flow gives you several options in one."
4,does what it should,These nipples are well made and do exactly what they should. Avent is a stellar brand that I have purchased time and time again.
3,Flow was too fast for my newborn,"I am an exclusive bfing mom, so when it got close to time to go back to work I started working with baby to take his milk from a bottle. I have always used the Avent brand. The nipple is wide enough for baby as to hopefully prevent nipple confusion. But when I tried giving my son a bottle he sucked a few seconds then started to cough. I started to play with the nipple by pointing it sideways and I barely squeezed it and the milk came out quite effortlessly. I also turned it upside down and instead of a slow drip is was a stream. After waiting a few days I tried my son again on the bottle with the other nipple and the same problem arose the milk was just coming out too fast. I ended having to use a different brand entirely. Now though at almost four months my little guy taked this nipple like a champ."
1,Hit and miss with leaking. Update: Junk,"The avent system is designed to not totaly seal to the bottle so it can vent through the ring instead of through the holes at the business end of the nipple. They sort of relyed on the fact that you can make something liquid tight but not air tight. The problem with this is when you are shaking the bottle in order to mix the formula with the water 50% of the time you will have a leak. Also when you tilt the bottle to put it in your childs mouth you will sometimes have a small gush of milk from the ring.I have tried several different things to prevent this. i have assembled it wet, dry, tightly, loosely, moderately, etc. but i cant seem to find a pattern with the leaking, they just leak sometimes. This is especially anoying in the middle of the night.Update: We have been having extreme issues with these bottles/nipples. The either leak or don't vent or leak or don't vent etc. We will never buy these bottles again. And we will never recommend them."
3,way too fast,"my baby is 8 months old, he's having his milk with cereal on the bottle so i bouth the variable flow but it's really fast even on the number 1"
1,Ridiculous!,"On the slowest flow my 5 month old ends up wearing more than he drinks! This is maddening when its breast milk. I had first tried it out at 3 months and just thought my baby was not ready for it, but by 5 months I know its not my baby, its the nipple."
5,Excellent Product,Avent nipples have been wonderful for my baby. I did not experience nipple confusion when I started my son on bottles and I am still breastfeeding. I am very happy with there products and would recommend them to everyone.
5,Good airflow nipples,"Since using these nipples my daughter has had considerably less colic. They are strudy and long lasting and you can purchase them in different stages so that the nipples never get old because before they are worn out its time to change them. These are also a lot thicker than normal nipples, they are of a higher quality but they only fit avent bottles."
5,great nipple,Our son likes this nipple. We started to use it when he was 5 month old and are still using it (he is seven).
1,save your money,"Do yourself a favor and save some money. If your old nipples don't seem to have enough flow for your baby anymore, get a needle and make a few more holes into it. If still not enough, make a few more OR make a couple with a hot needle. That is all it takes."
4,Good.,I got these for my 9.month-old as i had already bought the number 4s and the flow was too fast for her. Number 3s are perfect for her now at 9 months.
5,Perfect nipple for my little one,"My little one loves them! Perfectly suit her tiny little mouth and she has learned to spin the bottles for different flows, nice!"
3,Awful Smell,"I bought this powder based on it's excellent reviews. I had noticed I was always tired and thought maybe my diet was not complete. I hoped a multi-vitamin supplement would help. I have trouble swallowing large pills, so I decided on a powder. The ingredients are great. I was able to stomach it in some smoothies, but could not tolerate it in anything else. Because of my morning routine, making smoothies each morning was not the most efficient. I could not continue taking this supplement because I could not tolerate it in anything else. The smell was awful!"
2,Ugh...not for water,"I very much prefer powder supplements to any pill form so I've tried quite a few different kinds of powders for different things. Usually it's clear when you're going to have to add one to juice vs. water; however, based on the other reviews written here it seemed like this vitamin formula would be a breeze...wrong. a) I can't imagine anyone can tolerate this well with water. It ends up looking like yellowish vomit, which even with the best mind power I couldn't over look. b) It most certainly isn't tasteless.I could see myself maybe mixing this with some V8 splash, but it has the same consistency and mix-ability as protein powder so I expect the same after taste and mineral remnants.Ick. I'll take a gummi or juice vitamin."
4,Burlington Free Press,"Reed is such a master of the ""lick"" that he should be sponsored by an ice cream company.... Casual fans of guitar should be impressed; more studious six string enthusiasts will be wowed,Steve Lemecke,The Burlington Free Press"
4,Helpful Aide,"I was going to just flip thru this book as we are not in show business, but I ended up reading the entire book! I couldn't believe how helpful it was to my husband and I. He's a contractor and didn't know what steps to follow next i.e. LLC or corporation etc. but this book helped us to learn the pro and cons of each and helped us in other ways relating to general business. It was very easy to read and once again, quite helpful."
5,Philly Jazz Vocalist Extraordinaire!,"With a sexy little growl in her voice at the end of each syllable sung, Miss Justine approaches Jazz with undeniable T.L.C. not commonly found in many Jazz vocalists today.Of the selections featured here, one in particular stands out for me: ""Jazz Ain't Nuthin' but Soul."" It played one night on the local Jazz station here and I HAD TO email the station to find out who was ""sangin'!"" Let it suffice to say, that her voice wraps around each song and the songs actually give back to the singer! It's profound, but true. It's in the excellence of the arrangements and in the singer's innate ability to connect with the lyrics. Jazz ain't nuthin' but soul, and Miss Justine ain't nuthin' but one AWESOME purveyor of the Jazz vocal form! Shirley Horn would have given her two thumbs up, I'm SURE! :-)"
3,Someone should publish a new one!,"I probably shouldn't indulge my mom's preoccupation with her health, but she was using her father's 1947 medical dictionary and I thought she should have better! But a lot has changed since 1982, too; also, at only 215 pages, with large type it doesn't cover much. But it's the only one I could find! Someone should publish a new one for all us aging boomers!"
1,Minus one star wasn't a choice,"So incredibly disappointed with the Platinum 7. Lots of the things that have to be downloaded were on the disc from the old Create Card I had. Thought I was getting more for my money! HA!Waste of my time and my computer space. I ordered it from a phone call made to my home. The one really important thing she neglected to tell me during the sales pitch, was the internet thing. Make sure you know this before you buy. Unless you want to spend hrs on the internet trying to see what you want. and then finding it isn't, ignore this product and buy the one put out before it! It is good, but with one flaw, can't do as much with pictures. I do my photos in Microsoft Picture It! and then transfer them to AGC. But I'm definitely going to return this one if they let me."
1,Wrong Item in Box,"I ordered a used item, but the contents of the box was not the software advertised on the box. I contacted the seller to return the item for credit. I have returned the item at my expense, but have received no communication about receiving the return or a credit being issued."
3,greeting card software,"I've used american greetings creatacard platinum 7 for a while. It works pretty good, however, when I tried to reinstall it after I had to reformat my hard drive, this software would not install. I tried 4 different times and it would not install(only a very small portion installed, but not enough to use this software). when I tried to uninstall a portion of this software that did install, it was extremely difficult to get it to uninstall. Broderbund likes to make it difficult to uninstall their software.broderbund does not support any software that isn't current. you have to go to their website and hunt down the solutions to problems. Before I reformatted my hard drive, I had pretty good success with this software, but it's similar to printshop and printmaster.so I would say I would recommend this software if you don't have either of the two other broderbund card creators, but cross you fingers in the hope that you could get it to install."
1,Avoid this seller,"I just ordered a creatacard silver 7. I have been trying for days to get it to download. I finally took it to my girlfriend, because I thought I was doing something wrong. It is a blank DVD. When I ordered this I thought I was getting, the manual and everything. Not just a copy of the Dvd that does not work. And now I can't even return it, because I threw my paperwork away. ANd Everytime I try with amazon, it says this item is not refundable"
2,poor,"they aren't as good as you make them out to be, they said that you could see up to a 700 ft. but yet we can't see up tp 50 yards.my husband is a true hunter, he has a pair of monoculars with a camera on they that does better then the night owl.i wouldn't buy another pair.c saucier"
4,Nice Glove,Bought this glove for my son to break in for next season. Was a little confused with the description as it stated two different things...for left handed throwing and right handed throwing. Took a chance after calling Amazon rep. who assured me if it wasn't right I could send it back without paying return shipping. Received it rather quickly and it was the correct glove (for right handed throwing). This is a nice piece of leather and should last a long time. I'm only giving it four stars because we had to tighten the web strings in a short period of time. The ball kept getting stuck. Everything is ok though and I recommend it for the quality and price.
1,"Good idea, but it didn't work ...","I loved the idea of having a small ""travel"" firewire cable ... but this one failed to work right out of the box. By the time I found that out I had thrown away the receipt and packaging ..."
5,Exciting Music-Outstanding Performance,"I am in total agreement with Darin Tysdal's comments about this CD and can only add that although each Etude addresses a technical aspect of piano performance, they can more than hold their own as independent, entertaining works. Ms. Dissanayake's performance is impressive, both for her sometimes amusing and always clever interpretations as well as her obvious exceptional technique.I've had the pleasure of hearing Ms. Dissanayake perform many times as the featured pianist in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's MusicNow series of contemporary music, and can attest that her performances of this often ""difficult"" music are always outstanding. Chicago critics have called her ""extraordinary"" and ""... (a) ferociously talented pianist""The release of a second CD of more Etudes clearly confirms that Mr. Rakowski is delighted with this recording and the amazing Ms. D."
1,A bad gay version of a forrest Gump story,"I know that most gay movies are independent productions but why are so many of them so bad. You really have to suspend belief to believe that anyone could find the main character, as played by Matthew Montgomery, even vaguely attractive and want to marry him. He twitches and mugs and generally displays personal characteristics that would make most of us cringe....Just another of those gay versus the religous fundamentalist movies, not funny, not clever,badly acted and embarassing...Hard to take gay cinema seriously when tripe like this keeps getting released. There must be better screenwriters out there than what is presented here. I refuse to believe that ""Shelter and Latter days"" are abnormalities of gay cinema...Watched this as a feel good movie on Christmas Eve and it nearly made me toss my cookies"
1,Before you get married TAKE AN ACTING CLASS!,"OK., I finally figured out why this movie is sooooo bad. I was trying to give this movie a change , but it is impossible. I asked why is this movie so horrible, it does have potential? Well., it is the bad bad acting of the character, Matthew Montgomery needs to be typecast.... I have said enough!!"
3,sound quality is poor.,"A good story, fair acting, some good parts, but the sound quality was terrible. Some of it we couldn't even understand. Worth watching once if you can understand the dialogue."
4,Worth a look,"A bit of a rough start with Montgomery overdoing the part of the nerd, but ultimately the film settles into an delightful story with fine acting and endearing characters. Good laughs, some angst, and a bittersweet but optimistic ending. It's worth a look. By the way, I'm grateful for any gay films at all, good or bad. Yes, ideally, they would all be beyond excellent, but even in mainstream films with access to much larger production budgets and a far greater pool of actors the quality may falter. Matthew Montgomery, as a producer or actor, is a superior spokesman for the gay community. The film is certainly NOT tripe."
5,Excellent for Dagger Form,"The tanto was bought for use in karate class. It is well balanced and comfortable in my palm. The handle is a good size to make changes of grip and hand exchanges easy. Most importantly, even after several months of use, there is no wiggle between blade and handle."
3,A bit better than the house,"The magnets on this thing are not nearly strong enough to hold the weight of any of the figures, especially if the car is moving. The string mechanism only works sometimes, and gets messed up alittle if the car is pushed in reverse. The idea is good, but not well executed. How hard is it to make a magnet work? There is no point to the two street signs. They are just something for parents to accidentally step on."
3,A little disappointing,"I bought this for my 2yr old daughter and am a little disappointed. The pull string to make it go forward has never really worked (no matter the surface). When you back the car up (or drive in reverse manually) the pull string tire unravels and you have to push it forward again to get it back into the car. The magnets don't really hold the characters unless the car isn't moving much. But my daughter loves the toy any way, she is just into JoJo. A much better buy are the characters themselves (either plush or plastic). Those are great because they can even get wet (the plastic ones)."
1,Politicized Junk,"I've never liked Paris, he's always been a terrible producer and an even worse rapper. Every song on here sucks. MC Ren officially sold out when he hooked up with this clown. I respected Ren for helping overshadow this politicized garbage when he was with NWA and I frankly can't belive that he is helping them now. And Kam sold out too since his albums weren't heavily politicized either. These songs are boring, idiotic, and unlistenable with weak lyrics and wack beats and with distorted messages that only braindead idiots would listen to. This is one of the worst albums of the year."
4,Nice looking shoes,"They are very nice looking shoes, but they are not comfortable at all. I like them so I wear them anyway."
3,Lovely shoes but so uncomfortable,The shoes are beautiful but they're so uncomfortable you could just wear them for an hour or two not the whole night. They also run super small I'm usually a 8-1/2 or a 9 but I had to get a size 10.
3,"Product fine, service slow.",The product was very good but it took a long time to get here. Maybe because of the USPS instead of UPS. Don't expect it quickly.
3,Satisfactory,The product was satisfactory and shipped and arrived when expected. The lower-than-perfect rating is because overall I find the coffee machine and its maintenance more expensive than it's worth. But nothing wrong with this particular product or its seller.
1,Incredible Rip Off,I can't believe people actually think it's reasonable to pay $46.95 for 25 cleaning tablets! You can buy a jar of 200 Urnex Cafiza Espresso Machine Cleaning Tablets for $20.75; they will work just as well as the vastly overpriced Jura Capresso tablets. Save your money and don't buy this product.
5,Jura Brand for Jura Espresso makers,I order these about once a year and so it is not a big deal to pay $40 for the correct item when I know how long it will last.I have had several Jura automatic machines and I would not put any cleaner in them other than the one Jura says. The Jura machine is too big of an investment to start getting cheap on the cleaners.
2,Original Size Refill Problem,"I am also using the Original Diaper Genie and have never found any refills to fit. I bought the Genie as a gift for my sister with her first child in 1994 (she has 2 children) and now 10 years later I am using it for my newborn. What a disappointment it was when I realized the Genie was redesigned!!!:( Luckily, there was a partially used refill left in her Genie; I have been removing the liner from the new refills and stuffing them in the old ring. This is a hassel but I refuse to buy a new one when the one I have works perfectly. I am giving the Diaper Genie 2 stars because of the refill problem. Other than that, I am totally pleased!! My husband loves it too!!!"
4,Great Gift!,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who was having a baby. This is a good system if you don't want the stinky nursery smell.Why only 4 stars? I think that the Diaper Genie system is a little overrated and expensive. There are alternatives, but Playtex has done such a great job marketing this product that the other diaper disposal systems play second fiddle.Also, I would like for whoever makes the Diaper Genie covers to make them more readily available. I've seen them on crib bedding sets, but I haven't seen them in the store."
2,Nothing Fresh in This Harvest,"I bought this book because it had a cool cover, I like amateur sleuth mysteries, and I'd never read any in Ann Ripley's ""gardening"" series before. Though Ms. Ripley writes well enough, and she can follow a mystery plot formula, I was surprised at the sheer boredom of it all. Unless you like plants. Really like plants. The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue stilted, and any attempts at humor fell flat. Outside of a good climactic scene, the rest of the story had me sitting there wondering when something interesting was going to happen. I think the author missed her chances at using the characters to make the book sparkle. I couldn't wait to finish this one, but not because it was a page turner."
1,Don't bother!,"The interface is not user friendly. It is very limited graphically. It will only create visually horrible calenders. I'm sorry I wasted my money! I want something simple to use, with an intuitive interface, that puts out nice, smooth graphics. This is so far from that it's not funny."
2,They need programming help,"Version 9 is a slight improvement over ver. 8 but still has a number of bugs. It seems that they just cannot get all of their components up to date. There are still Win 95 DLLs in this version which leads to a variety of errors when running newer version of the OS. This problem began in ver 7 and has yet to be fully fixed. I really like Calendar Creator and want it to work, but after now upgrading three times in the past two years and still not having a properly running system I think I have done my last CC upgrade. Too bad, it is a unique program and really nice for many of us who like to build visual calendars."
1,Don't waste your time with this,"This is great if all you want to do is print blank calendars. Forget about trying to put in repeating appointments or events. Lots of great sounding features - too bad they don't work on any of the Windows operating systems. They had a great product years and years ago, but have gone downhill ever since. Don't waste your time or money with this program."
3,There's nothing else quite like it,"I have used Calendar Creator since DOS ver 4.0 which included an excellent printed manual. This is the only program I have found that can print a multi-week format and have a variety of both repeating and non-repeating events entered. The learning curve is more difficult with the online help (no manual) and a lot of trial and error. Also there does not seem to be a significant difference from version 8 to version 9. However, once the program is mastered you can print a multitude of different type calendars in different colors with an enormous selection of images. I have found no other software tool that can do what this one can do."
1,Don't bother ...,This product doesn't even deserve a star. Printing blank calendars is even a challenge. Some calendars don't work properly and upcoming holidays don't match the right dates. What a complete waste of time and money!
1,Not A Happy Camper!,"I used Calender Creator 4.0 and was very satisfied with the performance of the software. I had to upgrade due conflicts with printing and my operating system. After several hours with the tech support people, I have come to the conclusion, dust off the old computer which operated under Windows 95, reload the 4.0 version and be satisfied once more...I do not recommend this software."
5,Serenescapes - Easy Listening,"This CD has a wonderful relaxing sound. It's very nice for ambiance and also to turn down low in a quiet, darkened room and let the music suggest visions. It's very pleasant for soft listening to enhance the dining experience.I believe Mr. Armand's foreign travels have had very positive influences on these selections. I'm eagerly looking forward to the next release."
3,A step by step process for creating a mentor relationship.,"The purpose of this book is to help the reader use mentoring to achieve what they want in life. The book explains the benefits of having a mentor or being a mentor, how to fnd a mentor or prot√©g√© and how to involve mentoring in every facet of your life. This book would be good for anyone who is looking for a step by step process on how to set up a mentoring relationship. At the end of each chapter there are highlights given that recapture the main ideas. This is a handy guide to refer to when needed. I felt the book acclaimed the many benefits of having a mentor but didn't adequately address the benefits of being a mentor. The general tone of the book seemed a bit too self-serving and business oriented. The important aspect of a mentoring relationship, self reflection, is not addressed."
4,Great Saw,"I bought this saw a few months ago and just finally got to really use it. I installed crown molding in my dining room and living room and the saw worked great. Nice smooth and clean cuts. Even with the stock blade. I did spend about 1/2 hour checking to make sure everything was true. I did have to make a few small adjustments but for the most part it was dead on. I didn't give 5 stars because I did have a problem cutting the 3 5/8"" crown molding at a 45deg R/H angle. The motor would hit the molding and not allow the saw to fully penetrate the wood. I ended up cutting each piece a little longer then my final cut and went back for the 45Deg cut. Not a big issue but is worth noting. I imagine this is a common problem with most 10"" saws. The additional cost of a 12"" saw in conjunction with the extra cost of blades would not be worth the slight inconvenience of the problem I encountered."
2,My Experience with the Bosch 4410L,"For starters, please pay close attention to several reviews of the Bosch 4410 (which is essentially the same saw minus the laser) by professional finish carpenters. It is true that everybody has biases, but overall, if the pros don't like it, chances are you won't in the long run.I picked up my Bosch 4410L at the freight depot on the way to the job-site one morning a couple weeks ago. It arrived in great condition - thanks Amazon! I was excited to try out my new saw. Well, I have to say that despite all the great design concepts that the Bosch has, its actual performance fell far short of expecations. This 500.00 saw was not nearly as accurate as my 199.00 RIDGID chop saw! The cuts were wavy, probably due to the issues noted in some of the other reviews. For fine trim work, this saw is unacceptable, which is a shame because I really liked some of the features. I sent the Bosch back the next day and got a Hitachi C10FSH. I'm glad I did."
5,Great except for with stand,"I have this saw and a DeWalt Miter Saw Stand, things line up just a little odd. The saw is amazing,now complaints at all."
5,Elegant and precise tool but...,"I have been using 4410 l since January 2007(it is 9th month today). I do not have experience with any other sliding saw so I cannot compare this product to others.Likes: the product has precise laser and ergonomic handle, all tools for exchange of either the blade or laser battery (dies after 1month or so :( ) are located on or rather (in) your saw.Dislikes are these: many times I got splinters underneath the rotating part which blocked the rotation unless I cleaned it up; then there are sliding rulers that CAN BE CUTTED OFF if you are not careful while making bevel cuts, so be smart and keep them pulled aside; the break stops working properly sometimes and extensions that holds your material could have been little longer. The product is heavy, but that is expected.The 4410 l sometimes requires extra cleaning from splinter but it does precise cuts and so work with it is a game."
4,Works great so far,"This is my first miter saw so I have no reference for comparison. It seems to do a great job so far. Exactly as advertised. I was a little disappointed that I had to mount the laser guide myself, though. I would also like the degree selections to be less loose at the major angles like 45 degrees."
5,Amazing,This saw did everything it promised. A solid piece of equipment. I did crown mouldings with this and had excellent results. Great accuracy. I highly recommend this saw.
5,Excellent Saw and a great deal.,"This is the best deal you will find on this saw. Not only did Amazon have the least expensive price but I received free UPS 2nd day air even to Hawaii. The saw arrived in excellent condition despite the box looking a little beat up. After setting up the saw and checking all the adjustments I only needed to tweak the 0 bevel a very tiny amount. The adjustments are straight forward and easy to do. I would recommend using a socket wrench and seperate allens instead of the included tools. After set-up I cut base board for three rooms with no problems. The saw is easy to use and dead on accurate. The dust collection bag is pretty useless but by hooking up my shop vac I could contain about 90% of the dust. I looked at the Makita, Ridgid and Hitachi saws before making this purchase and the up front controls of this saw was the tie breaker for me. I would have no problem recommending this saw to friends."
5,This is a great saw. I would high recommend it.,There are several good points to this saw. The angle marks are raised numbers molded onto the frame during casting no sticker to worry about coming off. The factory blade makes clean cuts. And there is very little setup of this saw out of the box.
5,My search is over!,"I LOVE this saw! It's a dream. Extremly accurate, reliable and the laser feature is a wonderful addition. I dabble in cabinet making and at first thought I had overindulged by buying way too much saw for my use, but I'm glad I did! The only draw back is the poor dust collection feature, but I'm working on ideas to enhance the function. Otherwise I don't think many would be unhappy with the purchase!"
1,"This company never SENT it, even after contacting them (as you recommended)","I responded to Amazpn's earlier request to me that the company sent me the wrong item. Amazon recommended that I contact the company, which I did. The man I spoke to said he would research it and I would be contacted.I haven't heard a word since."
1,Beware -- Missing most of book!,Beware -- there are two different Kindle books with this title for the exact same price -- but this one only has ONE novella instead of four. Someone made a big mistake! I bought this and was able to return it but it was a disappointing waste of time.
5,Good product,I have an 89 jeep wrangler. Fits great and looks even better. They look the same as the original cant even tell the difference.
5,A Gem of a Find,In a word: Electrifying! I was left breathless just listening to many of the passages in this recording. Always in good taste the virtuosity and purity of Ms. Tomasone's playing never lets up for a minute through the entire CD. This recording is a MUST for all students of the flute to demonstrate the range and possibilities of the instrument. This recording is a DOUBLE MUST for all connoisseurs of flute music who enjoy the rare performer who seems to effortlessly breathe the music from her very soul.
4,Bombastic Bamboo!,"This music is played on a bamboo gamelan - instruments constructed of semi-circular sections of bamboo. They look a bit like a xylophone.The style is generally fast (banyunas) style, with interlocking melodies, prominent drumming, and using a ""gong"" which consists of a long pipe which is blown - digeridoo style.There is a peshinden (female singer) and male chorus, with many shouts and interjections of encouragement!Its a fast ride of lively folk tunes, which is completely different to the traditional Javanese court pieces."
5,Material is spot on,"Worth the small investment, the cd is fantastic, I would rather pay a small fee compared to the number of exam retakes I usually need to pass Cisco exams, the author decodes the rather obscure objectives on cisco ccie web site,as usual, a really excellent and expert guide, nice book and great addition to my library of ciscopress books, bonus material on the cd and chapter 9 is worth the price alone, great sample ccie lab with full solutions,"
5,Great book,I bought THE CCIE Security Exam Certification Guide. It is a great book. It provides me with the comprehesive security content and opens a new doors
1,Very Sahllow,This book is confusingly addressed to CCIEs. It should be addressed to CCNAs.Lots of technical and typographical errors.
3,Good outline for exam,"It gives you an idea about both written and lab exam. But you cannot pass the written exam just with this book. The book from Malik is way more comprehensive, covers twice the material of this book."
2,Don't Bother,"I bought this sometime ago and found it strange that this was targetting someone attempting CCIE certification as I do not beleive that it is in depth enough.The more important aspects of CCIE security would surely be IPSec [24 pages only ] and the 2 pages on VPDN was very disappointing.The whole book I found rather bland and contains quite a few errors [considering they had 5 CCIES involved,one is proctor and another is a triple CCIE ...]The explanation of the ISAKMP interaction with things like Hashing, DH, Keys etc was rather unclear and perhaps confusing at times.It's that not dreadful but I personally wouldn't waste the best part of 50 on it.Read the RFC's and the Cisco CD - you'll get on just fine"
2,Not enough to prepare for qualification Exam,"This book covers most info needed for the security qualification Exam, but not detailed and in deepth enough. I just past my test, I am glad that I bought the other book: Network Security Principles and Practices, which provides much more detailed infotmation and less errors.Some errors in this books were so anoying that I can't believe Cisco Press published it and endorse it as official preparation guide. One example, it constantly refer to IP protocol number ( 47 for GRE, 50 for ESP, 51 for AH) as IP port number, even a CCNA souldn't make that mistake."
1,Extremely light.,"This book is not fit to be an exam certification guide, I finished the book in about 6 hours and was disappointed with the few notes that I was able to pull from it.I then followed the Exam Certification guide up with ""Network Security Principles and Practices (CCIE Professional Development)"". This second book was extremely useful and was an essential learning tool that not only assisted me in passing the IE written, but will remain on my bookshelf for reference."
1,Unfortunately now outdated,"I have no doubt that this book would have been a useful resource when first published, despite the many errors in the text. Cisco have now updated the Exam content and this book is now missing around half of the material to pass the exam."
1,If you were confused before....,"I have used a lot of Cisco Press titles before and this is the worst of the bunch. Riddled with inaccuracies and poorly presented with no real value to add.The book contains information that is patently incorrect and will cause budding CCIE's to adopt an incorrect understanding of several core concepts.It also contains a CD with a testing engine. This really has to be seen to be believed. An example of what to expect from this is a question with 4 potential answers, three of which are the same. The answer is not even present in the options, and this is repeated throughout. On top of this some questions are not displayed correctly, giving the user a scenario and 4 answers but no question to go with it.In short, avoid."
3,A good global view to exam,"It's a good book with most of all topics to someone make the CCIE Security written exam, but not so deep."
2,Puddle depth? That's one way of putting it...,"As another reviewer put it: puddle depth. As is not uncommon with most CCxx prep books, Benjamin's CCIE Security coverage is barely broad enough and nowhere deep enough. I'm using this more as a basic overview for a topic, then it's off to the Cisco documentation and lab work for a few hours to figure out how the thing really works.Oh I wish for someone like Odom or Doyle/Carroll to write a CCIE Security book! It'd be two or three volumes, but it'd be worth the money, unlike ""CCIE Security Exam Certification Guide"". Buy it second hand, or better use Safari - at least you'll not waste a tree."
5,Great Guide and comapnaion Triple AAAA rating,"In a nutshell this is a great guide written by those you have deleveloped the program...for teh small cost of the book this saved me sitting the exam no more than once...great investment and highly recommneded in your persuit of any ccie especially the security stream. I was not dissappointed, I am sure you will find great value is this quailty guide by Cisco."
5,Right to the point !!!!,"The second edition of ""CCIE Security exam cert. guide"" by Henry Benjamin is really right to the point.New changes to the book and introducing new areas which the exam is based on, are really fantastic and helpful for Security candidates.Thanks to the pool of 500 new questions in test engine I'm sure you'll sit the exam confidently as I did.Yashar A. (Sydney,AUS)"
2,Disappointed,At first when I skimmed the book it looked good but now that I have read the whole thing it is disappointing. Many errors on technologies and simple stuff like answers not matching the questions in the chapters. Saadat Malik's book is much much better.
1,Help me pass with 82 %,Dear Mr. BenjaminWith the help of your great book I passed the CCIE Security Qualification exam (82%).I wanted to thank you for all your efforts to write this book.
1,Not recommend.,After reading 1/2 of this book I decided to return it.Probably it's not that bad as a review of what will be on exam but not definitely a preparation book.Too many errors. Especially in Foundation material...
2,Weak & fulled with typo's and errors,"This book is only useful as a very basic guide. The questioning in both book and practise exams are weak and easy to answer.Technical detail is very light. There is a very large number of errors and typo's throughout the book & disk, hard to beleive that it was proofed at all, and looks like it was rushed into production. If you base your prep' on this book you will probably not be sucessful at the written exam.Good Luck!!"
2,Totally out of date,"This book is completely out of date. It was relevant 3 yrs ago but it will not get you 20% of what you need to pass the current CCIE Security 2.0 exam.Information within is very broad and generalized - nothing like you'll experience on the test itself.Also, the test software from Boson is a complete joke. 1 in 10 questions are wrong. In other words, what they list as the correct answer is not always the case. Also, you'll find that you might click on an answer and then it tells you it's wrong and that the right answer is the same as the one you picked - only instead of 'A', it's 'C' for example. Sigh..... what a waste of $50."
5,Sexy book - not made specifically for Wicca pratictioners,"I bought WITCHES back in 1981 when it first came out (before the neo-pagan movement). While it does have some interesting Wiccan references, it is clear that it is not for instruction, but for novelty purposes. As a witch, I think it is a fun book to have with wonderful illustrations."
5,A Must For Anyone Interested In Witches or Witchcraft,"This book is an amazing mix of art, poetry, spells and stories about witches and witchcraft. Not Wicca, but the Craft itself, which is rarely explored independently of Wicca and Paganism. The pictures are raw and honest, as is the prose, so it is definitely not for children's eyes. Women who feel the pull of the moon, keep the secrets and powers of the witch alive, and worship the Goddess will love this book."
2,"A beautiful book, if a little too feministic","Like I said, the pictures in this book are beautiful, and are what attracted me to it. However, I feel the text does very little to deserve such elaborate illustration. It is too deeply steeped in the author's feminist views; it seems every time she mentions the inquisition, she has to remind us again and again that most of the people killed were women, the Church strove to suppress and accuse women, etc etc. The rest is all right, although it is not much more scholarly than most neo-pagan works. Oh, it could have done without the bad poetry as well."
3,This book was not for me!!!,I personally hated this book. You can't tell if the author is against Wicca or for it. She says witchcraft is not satanic but then she has drawings throughout the book of the goat. She also goes into detail about the tortures people faced if they were charged with being a witch. To me it was too graphic. If you are looking for a wicca book this is not the one!!
5,The pictures alone are worth the price -- but why Madonna?,Great photos have been collected and most of the choices are the ones you would expect -- except for perhaps Madonna. And that from a person who does not mind they included Mick Jagger but left off a few US Presidents.
5,Beautifully reproduced and unusual photographs.,"The clear, concise and lively text that accompanies this information packed book is a pleasure to read. The beautifully reproduced photographs are unusual and surprising, not the stock pictures you would expect in a more common end-of-millenneum tome. The people here range from the well known like John F. Kennedy to the less well known but important Emmeline Pankhurst (look her up). A most enjoyable and informative book that you'll go back to again and again."
2,"Good documentary, horrible DVD quality...HORRIBLE!!!","First of all, the documentary is pretty interesting. Husband lets his filmmaker friend murder his wife to collect the insurance money to fund his low budget horror movie that nobody will ever see.I'm giving this 2 stars because of the absolutely horrible DVD quality. Several times throughout the movie, the picture became all pixelated. It looks like a YouTube video. Other times, the video and audio become completely out of sync with each other. And this doesn't take place with any of the low quality VHS home video footage. I'm talking about the interviews they filmed when making the documentary. One point, the movie just froze. I checked the DVD for scratches but it was brand new.There's no excuse for this."
1,Simple story - but dated,"My 8 year old grandson loved watching the movie ""A Leage of Their Own"" numerous times, so I purchased this book for him. It is a short, simple story about a family separated during World War II. He read it in 5 minutes and enjoyed it, but I doubt it will be read again. I was looking for something more in depth which this was not. Not a bad book just not what I had anticipated."
1,Noise from a dead cat,"The only thing worse than the Lesser tracks on this 7"" are the Kid 606 tracks. This music will lead to the death of electronic music."
3,You get what you pay for,You had better know how to install this - it is sent without instructions.You will need first to screw these brackets on the hard drive then youalso must have the guide rails that screw on that to slide the entireassembly into the bay slot.It does not have tapped inserts like the cadmium plated item pictured.Prepare to improvise with larger diameter sheet metal screws if you stripthe threads on this.
4,"My wife like the 3.0, I received the 3.3 and like Reelight","This isn't the item I received, I was sent a 3.3. The 3.0, which my wife has and really likes, must becoming difficult to find. The 3.3 is very bright as in a spot light. I've found that the 3.3 is so bright in a small area that I loose my peripheral vision. I can turn the light off in town, cause I also have a set of Reelights (highly recommended) for visibility."
2,"Great logo, poor quality","Love the flag, but won't stand up to outdoor use. The seams loosen up rather quickly. Love what it stands for though."
3,brake & parts cleaner,this item works ok but it's not 20 oz. like it says instead it's 14.5 oz other that I like it and it does work ok.
2,Expensive,This product costs too much. Brake cleaners in the store sell for around $4. not worth it.
1,Throw this cd into the bonfire...,"Yuck! I don't know what this listener below from Boston is talking about. This cd is severely lacking in all areas of talent. She can't sing...can't play cello and is hard pressed to write a thoughtful lyric. Jen Wood is a far superior musician and singer. Plus her lyrics make some sense. It doesn't surprise me that they no longer play together. Buy Jen Wood's ""Getting Past the Static"". I beg you to skip ""From the Burnpile"". You will be wanting to shrink wrap it and send it back if you buy it."
2,Not as fun as the cars,"In a few short days since receiving this, the truck has been turned into a storage bin rather than a toy. The top of the cab and the windshield don't stay in very well, and it's just too big and bulky to crash very well. It's okay, just not what my 4 year old deems as fun."
2,not worth the price,"I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. There are two problems... 1) the book has no practice excercises and 2) the book is very small for the price! ... Considering that there are no exercizes, I would recommend a cheaper, one book course (I'm using Colloquial Finnish). Those kind (including Colloquial Finnish) aren't ideal either, but are a much better deal for the money. Buy a dictionary, a Finnish grammar book, and a one-book course and that is probably your best bet."
3,A good introduction to Bil Jee form,"Wing Chun Bil Jee: The Deadly Art of Thrusting FingersA good book as an introduction to Bil Jee form of Wing Chun,But the form in this book doesn't look like the complete form when compared with Bil Jee form depicted by GM William Cheung in his videos (The dvds of GM William Cheung for Bil Jee)The form in this book lacks several important sets which are shown in the vidoes published later by GM William Cheung himself."
1,Not worth the time,"The author, William Cheung, is often criticized for his own personal deviations from the traditional Wing Chun Kung Fu system. This book is no exception.I have a feeling that this book came before Cheung's sudden involvement in chi & meridian therapy, as it fails to shamelessly promote in the same way as his more recent writings.Though I was looking for a book on Wing Chun's third form, Bil Jee, I was greatly disappointed. His explanations constantly repeat and contradict each other and even go against the core Wing Chun principles (see the Bil Jee form photos for examples).This book is either evidence that Cheung has become too sidetracked in his own patchy modifications or that Cheung never knew traditional Wing Chun in the first place.One star for making a cheap bookend."
2,ok,you've heard of YLT... don't know which album to buy... sometimes a band's first album is arguably the best... such is not the case for this YLT album. buy anything later than 1990 and you'll hear why lotsa people dig 'em.
3,What is he singing?,"I agree with what other reviewers have said; this is an excellent, fascinating album, enhanced by a listener's experience of later YLT. However, the CD I bought is mixed so strangely that I feel compelled to ask if others have the same experience--the vocals are so distant that they are almost impossible to hear. Buried beneath the guitars. This is not similar to other YLT, not a hallmark of their sound, so I wonder if I just got a bad disc?"
5,Money Can't Fix Everything - but it helps!,"I greatly enjoyed this book because it showed the struggle of a Mom to find the right school, resources and work for her daughter...despite having all the resources available to her. For those with children with severe learning disabilities, it will help you see that a full rewarding life is very possible. For those with children with moderate learning disabilities, it will make you feel blessed for dealing with so few problems!"
4,"It's Robert Pollard, enough said.","Second solo release from the prolific singer/songwriter of Guided By Voices. Catchy ""lo-fi arena rock"", to quote the master himself. This continues where NOT IN MY AIRFORCE left off and certainly deserves your ear. Check out ""Subspace Biographies"" and understand why this man can make anyone whistle while they work."
2,domino,"the product is o.k. but i put resin in it and couldnt get it out of the mold so i had to cut it out therefore damaging my mold.so that didnt go so well,i suggest you to only use melted chocolate instead."
3,Small Steel Fireplace Grate,"Small, steel, and inexpensive. It looks like it too, but it does the trick."
1,Volumes 2 and 3 are Absent,"From what i got from the sample this is a terrific Encyclopedia containing information on numerous facets of Radio and its history.When i purchased the set i was disappointed to find that only volume one of three appears here and that only volume 1 is available for the Kindle. This is a bit of a mystery since the hard cover price of this encyclopedia is only slightly more than the cost of the first of three volumes in the Kindle format. After refunding my purchase Amazon added 'Volume 1' to this title's description.I contacted the Chicago based Museum of Radio and TV and was told that the publication is no longer in their hands. The prospect of contacting Routledge, the apparent copyright holder, is daunting as their website presents no clear method of how to contact someone.Too bad, such a young and acclaimed set should be available digitally."
5,A must-read for everyone!,"""Covenant Hearts"" not only asserts the importance of marriage in a human society but is a reminder to all married people and single people contemplating marriage of its highest goals. It provides valuable insight in just how to be truly devoted in marriage, to be an honorable and supportive mate and how to achieve true and lasting happiness. It is a perfect gift for newlyweds. It should also be read by those in marital turmoil, those divorced or contemplating divorce; in fact it is an important contribution to today's world and should be read by everyone!"
2,"Organized well, not a 5 star c.d. though","The disk is well-organized so, once you figure out the index (not hard, if you look!), it is easy to find the image you want. However, some of the images are thumb-nail only and they are not labeled accordingly. This means that some of the photos you can stretch or shrink without any trouble while others end up looking terrible. This made me have to re-do my efforts with at least half of the images I cut and pasted into my powerpoint."
5,Valuable reference,"I have been impressed by the clarity and eloquence of the short essays under such difficult to describe topics as ""the soul."" The references to primary works where the reader can find more information are accurate and easy to use, although the Encyclopedia itself does an admirable job of answering most of the questions I've had. It is richly illustrated, with an easy to read type."
5,Excellent,"This has almost everything you would want to know about the Baha'i faith. It's also fascinating to read--even though it's an encyclopedia, every time I go to look something up, one thing leads to another and I get sucked into it and end up reading much more."
2,Died within 2 years,"This worked well when it worked, but it just died this morning and we've only had it for two years. (Our carafe did have a piece break off earlier than that, too.) When asking customer service if it was normal for their coffee makers to die so soon, I was answered with ""well, mam, they aren't supposed to last forever."" In my opinion it should last more than 2 years. Oh well. We're going to try a different brand this time."
4,Unit is just O.K.,"While I think this coffee is beautiful, I don't like the way the carafe slides into the maker. It's very difficult and I have to force it back in and I always spill coffee. Maybe I just got a defective coffee maker. It hits the filter pause and hold device. I have to say it does make EXCELLENT coffee and very hot....so I guess I'll keep it."
1,Krups is Krap,"Krups claims this coffee maker is made of ""stainless steel for durability"".But, they forgot to include the heating plate, which is the main component.As a result, the heating plate rusts within just a few weeks. The rust not only stains the carafe, which negates the overall appearance; but will also quickly eat through the heating plate, making the unit worthless. So, this model is not durable at all."
3,Good but not perfect,"We had an earlier model Krups for years which is unfortunately no longer in production and replacement carafes are no longer available. So it had to be replaced after the carafe broke. I found this and liked the price, description and features such as interruptible brew to pour. This model makes good coffee, but there are a couple of things that keep me from giving it more stars. First the lid does not separate from the pot. This makes it more difficult to wash whether by hand or dishwasher. The only way it will fit in the dishwasher is sideways with the lid open, but water collects in the pot & it doesn't rinse properly. Second, there is something fairly temperamental about positioning the carafe in the unit before brewing. If it is not done properly, a mess results. I must admit I have not taken the time to call Krups' Customer Service for guidance on this yet. I am basically satisfied, but not sure I would buy another. We loved our previous Krups."
3,The honeymoon is over,"When Krupps moved into my home one year and nine months ago, things were great. We'd make coffee together every day. Sometimes TWICE a day. Usually, it was just the two of us, but sometimes we involved some of my friends. Krupps never said ""no."" It was so easy to get Krupps hot and wet. God, those were good times...But the party is over. I don't know what happened. This morning I wanted a little, but Krupps just wasn't into it. Now I'm getting the silent treatment. Krups just... just sits there. It doesn't matter how many times I try pushing the button, I get no response.I don't think we can ever make this work again, so I'm looking for younger model."
2,Fail,"I was pleased overall by the performance of this product, it even made decent coffee, but... The timer failed after only about 8 months. It started by making coffee as soon as the ""AUTO"" button was pressed, and now it starts brewing if there is power to the unit even without pressing ANY buttons. I've resorted to plugging it in when I get up which totally negates the original purpose I had in mind when I purchased it. I'm going back to the French Press - the coffee is better, and there's very little to fail. Too bad there isn't one with a ""preset"" function...!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Went through 2 units, each lasted 2 months. The carafe is awful. No way to avoid drips and spills. Nice coffee and very fast, which is why I tried it a second time. No way to fool me again!!!"
1,POOR QUALITY,"I ordered this on Dec 26 for a be lated Christmas gift to my sister. Two days ago, she called to say it broke and completely stopped working. Poor quality and I am requestsing a new one be sent to her - it has NOT even been 30 days since she recieved this KRUPS coffee maker."
2,In the dark,"Put this coffeemaker on our wedding registry and within two months the awesome blue light (which was one of the attractions) burnt out. Also as time went by, the hot plate became corroded. Love the look and ease of use although also experienced difficulty with inserting the carafe and had to clean up its drips every morning. We're on our way to Bed, Bath & Beyond to return it. :)"
2,Annoyed,"The first time I used this coffee maker, I apparently had not placed the carafe fully in the chamber, but the coffee brewed anyway - all over the kitchen floor. Shortly thereafter, the plastic lid broke when I attempted to remove it to wash the carafe. I went to Bed, Bath and Beyond to see about a replacement, which is not available. Their floor model had the exact same break in the lid. Pouring water into the reservoir from the carafe results in spilled water, and coffee also spills/drips when pouring. Didn't they do any user testing on this before they mass-produced it?"
4,Nice but top of pot is defective,The coffee maker is nice looking but right out of the box the little tabs that keep the lid on the pot were broken (one of them). It's not a huge deal but an annoyance daily.
3,"Good coffee, poor design",Overall nice looking and compact coffee maker. Makes a good cup of coffee. Big negative: the heating plate RUSTS and wears away--will expose the heating element soon--posing a potential danger. Costs too much to send back and replace. Obviously this must be a recognized design issue.
3,Unpredictable,"This is my second krups km1000. My first one worked great for about 6 months when the light burned out followed by a weak heat pad that didn't seem to keep the coffee as hot. I returned it to Dilliard's and got the same one. This time, 3 months into use the clock again has burned out. Time to replace again..."
1,what a disapointment,I expected much more from the krups name.The heating plate is chipping and discolored. The pot sticks to it. I purchased this for my office. I should have ordered another cusinart.
2,Disappointed,I bought this 4 months ago it brews very good coffee and has a nice look. Today I have to get a new pot this one has started to turn itself on at random times and every time when you pour the water in.
1,"arrived broken, flimsy plastic part","too bad as it looked cool, but it was also unnecessarily huge. Weirdly, we could tell from the broken part being put into the back water container that it must have left the factory this way, not damaged in shipping. Oh Krups. We thought we could trust you."
2,"Defective ""stop drip"" design","While the unit makes good coffee when it works right, the ""drip stop"" feature is defective. It often stops the coffee from flowing through to the carafe, resulting in the basket overflowing and grounds going everywhere. It's a pain to re-filter the coffee and clean the unit after this happens. The alternative is to watch the coffee maker like a hawk and, if coffee is not flowing, lift or jiggle the carafe to insure the coffee flows. In short, it's a pain."
1,Buy another brand.,It is broken a year later/can't turn it off!....not worth trying to fix....coffee was never really hot and marginal taste....much better products out there!
3,Good to see it in 'person',"This was made I believe in 1983, and though some things have changed, it really helps to see it live. She keeps referring to the 'sizing chart' which is not included, and that was very frustrating. I'm trying to find a way to contact her if that is possible, or find some sizing chart, but it really is extremely helpful to watch someone at work. Good video."
1,"dangerous, choking hazard","I bought a two pack of these pacifier keepers and they both broke in only 4-6 weeks. The plastic clip broke, releasing a small plastic ring that my son could have choked on in addition to leaving sharp plastic edges. Although pacifier keepers can be very useful, I feel this version is completely unsafe and dangerous for babies."
4,LIGHT ESSAY OF CULTURAL STUDIES,"Ziauddin Sardar's ""Introduction to Cultural Studies"" is nothing more than the title indicates. This lenghty essay merely presents basic concepts that are prevalent in a postmodern discourse between societal values, power relations, and the value placed on cultural ""norms"" given in various communities. Sardar presents the history of Cultural Studies as a discipline, which begins in a social context, but the analysis of which, takes place by various sociologists, philosophers (primarily Freud, Nietzche, and Hegel), and literary minds. Overall, the essay is enlightening as an introduction, a good preface to the discourse(s) one finds in most disciplines today."
4,"Additional on ""Introducing Cultural Studies""","The book is enlightening as an introduction. I recommend it. I do detect a strong British oriented and influenced view of the topic which, in certain ways, is refreshing. The United States tends to seem to think of itself as the center or the world and it's nice to read a book with at least a slightly different point of view.It should be mentioned that the book is very heavily illustrated so that the page count is somewhat misleading. If the book were not illustrated, it would perhaps be 50 pages or less. The graphics do help enliven what might be a dry topic for some. The ""Further Reading"" section at the end will aid those who would like to continue more in depth."
2,Cheap wig,The hair did not come straight and silky but folded so there were horizonal lines when worn the first time. The hair quickly tangled and became a rat's nest that was impossible to detangle.
3,Alright,"It worked for the night...you def get what you pay for and since it was for Halloween, it was fine."
4,C Primer Plus,"This is a great book. It has clear explainations and examples and it moves forward fairly evenly. Unlike many beginner's books, this book is thorough and does not dwell on topics or redundant examples. This book is for any beginner or intermediate programmer that wishes to build a serious C programming foundation."
2,review,"This book is too wordy. The programming excercises at the end of each chapter, in many cases are poorly worded. Additionally, the book does a poor job on file input / output and pointers. I definately would not recommend this book to learn pointers and file input/output."
5,Cushie great esp for price,"I was impressed with this neck pillow esp. considering the low price, and with super saver shipping it was worth trying. The U shape is deep enough for comfort and the bead fill is enough to be supportive but flexible enough to be comforable. I am considering getting another one. I liked this one alot better than several I paid twice as much for."
1,cheap not worth the $$$,I was very disappointed with this floating golf game. It was of poor quality and just about impossible to get the golf balls to go anywhere and it was impossible to hit or come anywhere near the green. I would NOT recommend this game at all.
3,Warning: Webkinz world is addicting,"Another cute webkinz that my daughter had to have. Each one comes with a code that you use to gain access to it in an online webkinz world. Although the Website is entirely harmless, and some parts of it educational it encourages children to be online playing daily because they need to feed their pet, and ""work"" to gain money to buy it things. Also, each pet comes with this online access only for a year and you need to buy a new webkinz every year or lose your online pet, so once you start you get hooked in! The webkinz and littlekinz (smaller less expensive webkinz) are relatively inexpensive so at least these collections don't have to be too costly. I reccomend trying to stay out of webkiz world, however if your child ends up starting, the husky is cute and fun as they go!"
3,Not worth the money.,"This little toy is quite fun in the beginning. After i entered the code, i thought webkinz world was really boring. nothing compared to animaljam.com or bearville.com. Those are both free for far more entertainment. The toy is not very flexible and looks cheaply made. On webkinz world, there is something called, ""Quizy's Corner"", a little area where there are educational test about math, science, and more. You can play that to earn kinzcash and have education.Above all, i would say that this cute little toy is not worth the money. Some people love webkinz and webkinz world. Maybe you are one of those people who like webkinz. If you do, then this toy is probably perfect for you."
2,"Smaller then expected...much, much.",I purchased two stuffed dogs to use as models for a pet jewelry collection that I was photographing. I expected the animals to be larger as described on the page....11 inches tall was one dimension. Wound up purchasing a dog mannequin from Amazon which worked out beautifully. I will give this toy Husky as a gift to a family member.
2,quality,The toy's leg was broken when we got it. But it is not worth to return. I just sewed it.Hope they check the toy before sending it.
3,Webkinz Husky,"This stuffed dog was typical except that it was smaller than most other toy dogs and it had an embroidered logo on its paw and a hangtag with a ""secret code"" children can use to register on the Webkinz website. Well, the website is terrible and centers mostly on trying to direct children to retail centers to purchase other Webkinz merchandise. The dog itself is pretty typical,and is floppy like a BeanieBaby. I do not understand all the hype nor the extra cost for this Webkinz animal. Save your money and buy your child any UL-approved stuffed dog and he/she should be happy."
1,No support for Webkinz website,"We activated our webkinz online and the online pet and his house wouldn't load. It's been 7 days and I have tried to contact webkinz support several times. They refuse to respond. This is a shame, because the parts of the website that do work are educational. However, my nephews simply can't play it because the reason they wanted it was to take care of their pet and their house. Needless, to say I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Cute but cool,I can lose it very easily.. When I went to Santan Tonio I lost it by dumping my webkinz out
5,Love it!,"OMG I love the webkinz husky. It is very soft. You can pretty much do anything with it! This pet is one of my favorite webkinz. I recommend this webkinz for dog, wolf, and fox lovers. :) I also recommend it to any people who like stuffed animals."
2,Cheaply made,"Slightly better than the pink poodle, but still a disappointment. Would not buy a webkinz again!Also, would not buy a stuffed toy of any kind on line."
5,webkinz husky,got this in the mail it was smaller than i expected but it is cute and soft my cat plays with it all the time and she likes it and its holding up pretty good.
4,Cute,"Got this for my girlfriend. She likes Huskies and it comes with a little code where you can mess around online with it, though the online games are mainly for kids, she still tinkered with it a little bit. This little guy is pretty cute and adorable as heck. Not too terribly expensive, so its worth picking up if you like plush animals."
5,Kid loves it,"My son loves this thing. He spends at least 5 hours a week caring for his WebKinz on the computer, which I was not fond of until I noticed there is a lot of educational content in the play."
2,Missing too many street names.,"What is the point of a map, if it doesn't show the street names? Most major, and some minor streets are named, but plenty of them are not. So far, I've located only 1/2 of the places I was looking for with a pair of cross-streets. On the other hand, I couldn't find any alternative maps."
5,Heaven or Hell for people in your community-Your Choice,"Ted has a way of making things simple in this book. It does so much more than explain how to make it hard for people to go to hell from our city. It helps establish a biblical worldview and really tests your motives. Very humbling. I would recommend it to those in leadership as well as the congregation.Remember, whose kingdom are we building?"
5,Tree of Life Book,"Revolutionized my view of grace. Ted Haggard is a good teacher not only on what to do, but why."
1,Pastor Haggard's advice: go to another city,"for soliciting prostitutes and drug buys!In his own city, he practiced self-hate, hypocrisy, and bigotry.How very, very ""christian!""But now that he's gone from his mega-mall church, those ""christians"" left behind can still practice those godly virtues on their own."
1,"Functions, but not well at all","I bought 2 of the 20W models for a project and was very disappointed. In both units, the wall charger that came with it did not function (one worked for about 2 minutes before pooping out). I used a different charger - I was careful to match the voltage and charge settings. Both units did start charging. After a long 36 hours they finally showed a full charge. When I tried to use them with a 10W device, the power only lasted for about 10 minutes. A real waste. Not that expensive, but I would skip this unit if you have a choice."
1,Underperformer,"It seemed to work great for one charge cycle and then never would fully recharge and supply power for more than a few seconds. A dismal failure, in my opinion. I would not recommend this or any similar Black & Decker product."
4,Old Fashion Christmas Music,"If you enjoy old fashion Christmas music, this is the CD for you. I especially liked this Sussex Carol on this CD."
1,Deceptive Product Description,"The Product is described as 1/2 size pan grate cooling rack. The industry size for a 1/2 pan is 18"" x 12"" and this pan grate cooling rack was definitely not the size of my other 1/2 pan cooling racks. In the end I'm out approximately $18.00 in shipping fees with nothing to show for it. I do not recommend anyone buy from someone who deliberately misrepresents their product."
3,"Gorgeous doll pictures, text leaves me weary.","I enjoyed looking at the pictures in this book far more than I enjoyed the writing. The writer seemed to go and on at certain points, having at least it seemed to me, 100 ways to define a doll. Sometimes less is best. I could not finish reading the book, but the pictures were quite a treat."
3,I was Asked,"to review this by the author, and he would'nt let me do it in a way until I'd finished the book! But that is not how reviews work. I offended him enough to not be his Amazon friend perhaps. Ya know, the book goes off on many subjects with no bringing them back to the original one. I'm happy tp revise Reviews, But I do know I don't have to read ANything all the way untiL I review it. This guy picks out people who seem stupiD..He's right in that I review pretty much anything that I like only. Check out how Many Amazon (He's FULL of advice as well...Keith..) friendS he has..He invites people to read the book and review..Why? I don't know.."
4,"Excellent, but try it first.","I don't know if this albumn is for everyone, but I loved it. Some of the songs such as Deeper, Phone me tonight, and The First Big Weekend of the Summer, go down in my list of all time favorite tracks.I would certainly recommend listening to this albumn on a good stereo - a lot of the lyrics sound muffled on bad headphones, making the heavy accents harder to understand. The lyrics are worth it though - Pessemistic, world-weary, but honest and very personal.This albumn is more varied than some of their later stuff, and one or two tracks are just plain painful to listen to (whistling?) - You certainly can't call this albumn over-produced. This adds to the appeal, though, reflecting the lack of pretention in the music.In my opinion, this is Arab Strap's best albumn. Buy it, love it, then buy all the ones that follow. You won't regret it."
4,Every dev shop should have this book,This book does not tell you what development methodology you should use instead it uses a variety of tools and applies them in real world environments. This book is a must for every team/dev lead.
3,Great for starter-level,"Put it simply, if you have some real experience in software development industry for, say, 2-3 years, then you already should know most of what this book tells you.If you are a student or just a beginner trying to understand how real-world software is made, you should read it.For me, it was just a waste of time and 20 bucks."
4,Delivers reflexion for experienced developers.,"The book contains 36 practices, which can be applied throughout the development process. The practices are grouped into Techniques, Infrastructure and Process. Each practice ends with a list of checks: warning signs and signs of success are listed. These lists are very valuable in helping to steer and measure the success of a single practice.The practices are peppered with tips. The book is a quick read and not unnecessarily long, still the practices are explained well and often start with an anecdote encountered by the two authors.The book might not deliver that much innovation for an experienced developer. Nevertheless it is a good source for reflexion for advanced developers. It has quite some overlap with theThe Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Masterbook.My favorite practice is the first one: it says to choose and abandon habits. If a habit does not work, it might be good practice to question it and look for an alternative."
1,Knitting in Crisis is a pathetic way to look at this artform,"One of the cardinal rules of knitting is ""No whining!"" Yet Lydon begins, continues, and ends with one whiney crisis after another and tells us how she knits her way out of her melodramatic (and sometimes downright boring) problems. Knitting is about FUN. It's about creating beautiful works and great relationships with others. Yes, knitting can be a great comfort in times of trouble, but hey ... it's way more than that. A richer path of spiritual growth is one in which we celebrate our triumphs and concentrate on how the challenging and gorgeous things we knit bring us together with own souls, and with others who share our passion. It's about discovering the delight of who we are, what we create and what we pursue. Lydon needs to lighten up."
1,Disjointed ramblings of unrecovered addict,"I, me, my, I, I, I, I. Boring, boring, boring. Little if anything to do with knitting, little to do with spirituality, much ado about Susan. Knitting for her is just another fix. Glad I got it from the library.The author says 12 Step Meetings bore her to death. No wonder. She can search everywhere for an outside spiritual practice, but she has developed nothing within."
2,Too little knitting...,"... too many platitudes, too much Susan. The author writes of her spiritual search and how knitting is part of it. However, skims over the life events leading the search (including barely mentioning her child and former husband), leaving me wondering why she was searching. She appears to get completely consumed by the passion of the moment, and then move to the next one.While she writes of the mediative nature of knitting, it's all the basics, nothing particularly insightful for an experienced knitter.On the plus side, it's a quick read and I polished it off on my commute today."
1,Not What I Ordered!,"I ordered these nipples because my children will not take any other and I was so excited to find them since they have become so hard to find! I was willing to pay the outrageous price just to get them in hand. I waited, anxiously for them to arrive, only to find an entirely different item in the box. Instead of 2 squared off laytex fast flow nipples as pictured, I recieved 2 silicone rounded nipples. I am angry not only for the false advertising, but also because I have to now send them back and pay a re-stocking fee to the company who sent them out! Amazon - you let me down!!!!"
4,The only nipple my baby will take,"This nipple mimics the real thing; thus, this is the only bottle my daughter takes. And I've tried them all (e.g., Avent, Tommy Tippee, Mam, Dr. Brown's, Born Free). The down side to this nipple is the fact that you cannot purchase them at the store. But I don't really mind since I do most of my shopping online (it's really hard getting out of the house to run errands with two little ones). I highly recommend this product."
5,Best in everything?,"I would have to say yes in this price range.Pros:1. Sony Trinitron quality2. Stylish looks, color, quality.3. Has 4 port USB hub built into the monitor. There are two on each side to make hooking digital cameras to Pocket PCs a haggle free task.4. Stands on 2 strong neat looking legs to make it easy to clean the desk under it. Comes with a slide like bar that goes on the back side of the monitor that lets you adjust the angle of monitor with ease.5. All adjustments done with one button at the center using a great and simple menu. Very similar to the Sony's jog-dial functionality found on their remotes.Cons:1. Too heavy.2. No built-in microphone."
5,Best book,"My daughter loves all Spot books and especially the ones that have flip pages. We have them all, they are very educational."
3,"keep it simple, kids love it!","when your toddler is in the stage where they are making three word sentences, Spot is perfect for them. like Maisey, the graphics are bold and simple. The plot line, if we may call it a plot, is also simple. This happened, this happened, this happened, and then everything was all right."
2,Yog? ... Yuk!,"The original Japanese name of Toho Studios sci-fier, YOG, MONSTER FROM SPACE is ""Gezora, Ganime, Kameba: Kessen! Nankai no daikaij.""Here, the monstrously tentacled Gezora is, like Godzilla and so many other creatures of this genre, just a guy inside a cheesy rubber suit. This one even has electric light eyeballs! Unfortunately, despite all efforts a walking octopus just looks darn silly!SYNOPSIS--Aliens invade a space probe, then crash it on a deserted atoll. Their plan is to infect small animals with bacteria that can quickly transform them into giant creatures which will... CONQUER THE EARTH!.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb user poll rating.(5.8) Yog: Monster from Space (Japan-1970) - Akira Kubo/Atsuko Takahashi/Yukiko Kobayashi/Kenji Sahara/Yoshio Tsuchiya/Yu Fujiki"
4,alien spacedust possesses squid...,"...and then some more: the squid-swims/walks, the turtle and especially the also giant lobsta!-and all this done on the island for the goal of takin over da world-ha. good action from beg. to end; i liked the island. lax in film q. on vhs. rarely seen movie."
1,No ENGLISH subtitles!,"I purchased this because it was the only version that I could find that is supposed to play on US region DVD players. However, it is only in Spanish and Italian. NO English subtitle option."
5,Cute puppet,"I am a teacher and have used these puppets in the classroom. My teenage students fell in love with them. the oinking noise was a hit. The puppets are very well made, soft and just plain adorable. I am looking forward to many years of enjoyment with these."
2,Not bad but not good either,"I bought this book after travelling to Turkey several years ago and being told by everyone I met that Yashar Kemal was 'The greatest living Turkish writer' Believe me he isn't. The book is well written but is overshadowed by Yashar Kemal's own political agenda (leftist)that totaly misrepresents South Eastern Turkish culture. Kemal just gives us the usual nonsense to pander to the Western audience, Sunni sword weilding fanatics, Kurds and Armenians skipping and dancing together in perfect harmony yawn!If you are looking for a book that represents Turkish culture then this isn't it, there are far better Turkish writers that Yashar kemal but unfortunately there works have not been translated.(Ahmed Hamdi, Necip Fazil the list is endless)By the way, if you do buy this book you will not need to buy any other or you will find as I have that pretty much all of Yashar Kemals novels are exactly the same."
3,A lot more fun than using a mouse...,"The hardware is very easy to install- no issues whatsoever hooking it up and getting everything to work. The EA Sports Tiger Woods 2004 game that is bundled is a good game with a good selection of courses. On the negative side, the ball flight isn't particularly realistic- I rarely hit a draw on the course and I can't hit anything but a draw with this game. If you take a divot with your normal swing, you'll probably cause the mat to hop which seems to throw off the orbit of the ball and consequently your results. I was pleased to see the unit came with a spare ball but disappointed to quickly figure out why- the first ball was pretty well toast after one weekend of use. Their customer service department offered to replace one ball but after that, I'll have to pay for new ones...Overall, worth it for the price- just don't expect this to feel like the real thing."
2,Close but no cigar,"I got it, works ok, but isn't very accurate. I tried the worst slice swing I could manage, and it recorded it as a pull - draw. Impossible, but still sort of fun."
3,Celebrity 2-pack worth the wait?,"the simpsons toys r us exclusive Interactive mobile home environment, is a little pricey for what you get.playmates flooding the market like hasbro with star wars, with anything and everything with the simpsons logo.the mobile home has 2 walls 2 figures thu the homer with cowboy hat is cool.Wheres Moes bar,they made a church,why not a bar.and how exclusive is this 10000 or 10000000000? can you say blockos."
2,What a Sad Waste!!,"The several recipes I have tried in this book are great. BUT the format absolutely could not be worse. Ingredients on one page, turn the page for the method, every time. The index is worthless because it lists things like ""Aw Shucks"" as a corn recipe, or ""Blithe Spirits"" under asparagus. The names give no clue whatsoever as to what is in a dish or how it's constructed, and all the names are so cutesy they would gag the proverbial maggot. A waste, because the few recipes I've used are really good, but in the main it's too frustrating to try to use this one. Seems like the authors just got really bad advice on the design."
1,And another thing...,It doesn't tell you how many people each recipe serves. It's all a guessing game. Don't have time.
4,Nice quality for the money.,The value is good the only difficulty is with hat sizing. The XL hat I bought is just a bit small.
3,It's OK,"good hat, tho' too low crowned like almost all modern Stetsons. If you can snag one for less, like at Falkoffs dot com for forty bucks, it's ok... it needs a higher crown & leather sweatband, IMO... my .o2"
4,Great Hat and Price,"I have been looking for a replacement for a identical panama Straw hat and found the best price here. I received the hat in a very timely matter and in great condition. The Hat was well priced below the compeitors and was similiar to the one I was replacing, with the excetion of the weight and feel. I can recommend the store."
2,not as good as it seems,"i rated this really low because it was not at all what i was looking for. the information about this book lead me to believe that it was alot more ""crafty"" than it was. i was looking for something our 1&2 year old nursery kids could do during the church worship hour, but it turned out to be cheap, cheesy crafts that if you thought about it you could make up on your own. i was looking for something a little more...i guess the word is sophistcated....this stuff was making things with toilet paper rolls, or photocopying a picture so they could color it. duh..who hasn't already done that?? talk to a kindergarten teacher and they have probably made most of this stuff up on their own already! basically, someone thought to write down all of the already done....overdone crafts from household products and made money on it. kudos to them for thinking of it first!! i'm just sorry i wasted my few dollars on it. you'd be better off continuing your search for craft ideas."
4,pretty good,"This book was okay for me. This was the only form of study I had, so it may be a limited opinion. Though the vocab. was thought to be too short, i didnt even go through all of it, I suppose if you are diehard this book may not be enough, but for a one or two month book it did enough. They talk to you through the book like a person which was cool."
2,bad bad,They didn't have much examples. I didnt like it thateach section was short and succinct in explanation. Never recommend this book.
2,not for my breastfed baby,"we tried these nipples after using the Nuk orthodontic latex nipples because we needed to step up the flow and Nuk doesn't make their nipples in anything other than a slow flow (at least, i couldn't find them if they do). however, my breastfed baby did not like them. the base of the nipple looks more rounded in the images than it is--it's actually quite flat. we found that our son preferred something he could put his whole mouth around, as it would more closely resemble nursing. these nipples were a no-go. we ended up just making the hole bigger in the Nuk nipples and that seemed to do the trick. it's too bad Nuk doesn't make a medium flow nipple, but these definitely were not a good alternative."
1,Too Small Labels,"This is just a helpful warning: The labels that come from GlobalStar Software are TOO SMALL for any regular size CD. They do not fully cover the CD, making it look ridiculous. Isn't the purpose of using a label to COVER the CD?"
2,Not useful due to very small field of vision,"The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing. If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark. But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.Also, there is too much ""noise"" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark. You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive device"
2,Night Owl Optics,"The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense.Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.Other than the above, the monocular has performed well.epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it."
4,low price good value,"thes item is gretes item i used befoer for these prise!! yes is true is very clear optics , you can see in total darknes about 350 m it's agood rand , price and qulity ."
1,Good only if your an expert knitter,They go way too fast when showing a type of stitch. I'm not a beginner or an expert but bought this CD to learn differnt types of cast ons ect. Good luck if you can figure out what their doing. Not for beginners.
2,Not for newer knitters,I feel that this DVD is definately NOT for newer knitters. The explanations were not clear and the demonstrations were done quickly. I would like to return it.
1,Not enough cushion for all day on feet.,"Not enough support. Also heel is too high for all day on feet. However, they look great."
2,"""Pitchy""","There are a lot of downs to this items. Let me put in compairson.Good: Sunday, Morning, Since You've Been Gone, I don't Want to Be, True.Okay (but annoying after a while); Shut Up, Karma, Let's Go.Ugly,1,2 Step, Let Me Love You, Some Cut, Bring 'Em Out, Truth Is, and I'm a Hustla.I am overall very annoyed and disappointed in this album."
2,4 OR 5 WORTHWHILE SONGS,Too much rap. Rap sucks. All rap songs are about the same thing over and over again. They're all about the thug lifestyle. Lock em all up and spare us from the pointless banter. Shame on totally hits for all of this rap.
3,totally hits 2005 vol.2 My Predictions!!,Here are some of the songs that might be onTotally Hits 2005 vol2!1.Kelly Clarkson: Behind these Hazel Eyes2.Gavin DeGraw: Chariot3.Mario: How Could U4.Fat Joe feat. Nelly: Let's Get It Poppin5.Missy Elliott feat. Ciara: Lose Control6.Foo Fighters: Best Of U7.Simple Plan: Untitled8.Ryan Cabrera: 40 Kinds Of Sadness9.Fantasia: Free Ur Self10.Pretty Ricky: Grind With Me11.Mashonda: Back Of The Club12.Ying Yang Twins: Wait(The Whisper Song)These are the Only Song that i could come up with. There Might be other song that make this cd. U just have to wait unit it comes out later in the year! Until then.
5,totally hits 2005 vol. 2 not coming out,I doubt that this cd is coming out it one month till totally hits 2004 vol 2 would of came out on oct. 4 and there no way in heck they can do a preorder thing within a month dont think they are releasing totally hits cd anymore cause they stink and no one is buying them and that good new for NOW company 2 cd set i rockon if they were to do that NOWSSSSSSSSSSS rock totally hits SUXXXXXXXSSSSSS
2,TOTALLY WASTE,when songs are overplayed on the radio even songs that sound great begin to sound horrible and thats the clear truth that most of the people who listened to these compilations experience add to that too much rap beats add to the chaos so lets leave these rap numbers for a while in these NOW compilations and see how it works
5,Excellent bag,"I really liked this bag, the size is perfect for carry-ons. Well made, Kipling is the best in bags! Love all of them"
5,a great bag,I am so glad to have finally purchased this bag. A client has 2 of them and I saw how nice they are. This vendor had the best price and the service was just fine!
3,No lock,"hi,I was so happy when I received the Kipling Madison 22"" Wheeled Duffel (Espresso)but there was a problem.A lock for the bag was not sent with it. So I wonder why?"
4,spaghetti heaven,the films in this box set offer good value and the picture quality varies from fair to very good a good buy for fans of the genre
4,Way cool!,"I bought this for my 4yr old daughter (to use on her big bro's gameboy advance). She loves it. Forget video now, get this instead. The video runs for 40 minutes plus. Great for car rides, long lines etc."
2,Okay,"The book is great, but was not the shape I expected it in. There were markings throughout the entire book so I have to erase them before I can complete my own."
5,Outstanding,"I bought this CD on a lark, loved every song and I recommend it to anyone with fully functional ears.How in the world can a record company sign trash like Brittany Spears and pass up on this performer?I don't want to rant, but give the samples a try and you will likely enjoy it enough to shell out the $0.99 x 5 for his songs.Mr. McCarthy is a talented individual who has not yet been recognized but certainly deserves it."
4,Nice,"It's a nice book, with excerpts of letters, and many photographs; although geared towards children, I at sixteen found it adorable. Although when you look at it, it's sad--how an innocent girl, caught up in politics, was shot. It's a nice look into the ""eyes"" of Anastasia, and I bet 'Shvyzbik' would be pleased."
2,Natural? Not sure about that,"How can this shampoo be labeled ""natural"" yet still have parabens in it? I'll be looking elsewhere for my baby porducts."
4,Perfectly fine British cast recording of the classic show.,This is a perfectly fine recording of the 1986 British revival presented at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Suzie Quatro can't hit the high notes and can get a little raw at times but she acts the part well. Eric Flynn is a bit long in the tooth for Frank Butler but vocally he's fine. There are 18 tracks including the later interpolated OLD FASHIONED WEDDING. The two soubrette songs are eliminated. At 56:06 this is a nearly complete rendering and is recorded as are all the Chichester shows as if you are front row center with a typical pit orchestra. It stands with most recordings of the work and is a fine choice if you don't care for Merman or Hutton or Martin.
4,pretty sub-standard attempt,"A pretty sub-standard attempt at redoing what was done perfectly before, the Chichester Festival production of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN was almost perfect...and the reason is simple. Any production of AGYG either flies or falls on it's Annie Oakley; and the casting choice of Suzi Quatro is a pretty miserable one indeed.Although she has the Southern twang down pat, she just can't sing the songs with any depth or emotion. Her Annie Oakley is just not convincing.Eric Flynn is great as Frank Butler, and the rest of the cast are wonderful too, but poor Suzi Quatro's tired and scratchy vocals seem too threadbare in comparison. One wonders how she kept up 8 performances a week in what is considered one of the most demanding roles you can do in musical theatre.Overall, a fair recording."
1,Not as described,"I contacted Amazon because this product was not as described. The log was 2 inches smaller than the listed dimensions and the picture was entirely inaccurate (my log had no light colored bark, no outline on the green leaves, and different knobs coming out from the log).The product I received was not aesthetically pleasing and it was much too small for my hermit crabs. After looking at other Reptile Cafe products on Amazon, the reviews seem to give the same consensus. The product you will receive is not worth a steep $10. I returned my log and don't plan on purchasing any other Reptile Cafe products."
1,Inaccurate picture,"When I saw this hide away I was initially attracted to how pretty it was.Unfortunately when I received it the product was different from what the picture showed.I did not receive the above photo.Instead the one I received was all dark brown. No tan bark and it was covered in red flowers.Not impressed. Living on a boarder town it's too much work to pay bridge fair, shipping charges and have to cross the boarder once again to pick up a new one if i did ship it back, it's just not worth it for me.Also the inside is extremely sharpe. I don't think it's very save for my gecko to be rubbing around in.I'm worried about my baby gecko being cut so it was a waste of time and money for me."
3,S,Does not look like pictured product at all and was much smaller than indicated. Mine is really ugly and too small for my fish.
2,"its small, howver, it has a loud 60hz hum","I was looking for a smaller UPS to handle small transient outages so runtime was not an issue.This looks like it would do the job so I gave it a try and sadly the loud transformer hum is noticeable 15' away.While such noise is expected when the unit switches in,once the battery has been charged I would expect such noise to be gone.Just keep in mind the sound if you plan on being near where you deploy this item."
3,Bowie? Tom Waits? Not hearing it...,"I'll admit that I've only listened to the album once so far, but i hear absolutely no resemblance to David Bowie, and very little to Tom Waits. What it sounds like to me the most is Xiu Xiu with many more sounds and instruments. This isn't bad, necessarily, but the vocal resemblance between Carey Mercer of Frog Eyes and Jamie Curtis of Xiu Xiu is uncanny. I hear nothing like Bowie when I listen to this.Even so, this album is fairly enjoyable and interesting, and i should probably listen to it a couple more times before casting my vote, I just was shocked not to find anyone else drawing this very obvious comparison-not on Amazon or anywhere else."
3,Very Unique,The first thing you will notice is the crazy vocal style. He is like a dramatic singing wildman. Tom Waits esque. He doesnt sing so much as sing/speak. He hints at the melody.The songs are organic and full of smelly life harkening back 100 years ago in early 20th Century America.You may not be able to make out much of what he says.A lot of the songs are difficult to tell apart untill many listens.But its interesting.Thats all I can say right now.
2,Interesting read but I hated it,"Love Janny Wurts and Curse of the Mist Wraith series.Loved this book up till the middle of the book, peeked at the end, never finished it.Go back to wriing about Arithon, stilted phrases of that I can deal with."
4,Why did she rush the ending?,"This is a quality book for the reasons given amply by other reviewers. However it lost a star from me for two reasons: the ending is rushed, and I got sick of how the main character, crippled almost to immobility early in the book, suffers a continual unrelenting onslaught for most of the rest of the book, without ceasing to be an amazing killing machine. It was just too much! As the cliche goes, sometimes less is more.Having said that, it's still a better fantasy book than many so buy it, read it and enjoy it!"
3,To Ride Hell's Chasm,"Janny has a way of sucking you into her stories. I thought that the rescue of the Princess was too drawn out, and the ending was way too short. I loved diving in and immersing myself into a different world. I struggled giving this a 3 or a 4 rating, but gave it a 3 because of too many chapters to do the rescue and thought more could have been given to the ending and resolution with the different characters.What I like most about Janny's books is her character development. OK she lets her heros take a lot of abuse, but you get to know her characters, all of them. I bought this on my Kindle and have bought a few of Janny's books in paperback here at Amazon."
1,cheesy,"I thought this CD would have christmas music played by authentic mexican mariachi players. boy was i wrong. there is one trumpet playing with a cheesy ""music machine""This would be the perfect gag gift for a mariachi music lover."
1,an absolute must MISS,"I will not waste your time with a lengthy review; just like I hope you won't waste your time watching this movie. The plot is horrible; the acting is bad; and idea is a waste. Of all the lesbian movies that I've seen, this is definitely the worst...and I am a lesbian-movie-connoisseur! I can't even express how irritating the characters and their actions are. Please put this on the bottoom of your list of films-to-see!"
1,Run and hide,"I have a list of lesbian movies that I am interested in buying over the next few months or so. Fortunately a friend of mine bought this movie before I had a chance to consider it as it was quite frankly the biggest load of crap I have ever seen.Look, I must admit, I am not one for stereotypical butch and femme relationships so for starters that was a HUGE no-no for me. That just added to the fact that just about everything else in the movie was badly done.Harsh maybe, but if like me you live in the lipstick lesbian world and loved movies like Saving Face, this one is definitely not for you."
2,uhh.....not what I expected,"I have seen worse, it's a little weird! When I first watched it I thought it was good because I hadn't seen very many lesbian films, now that I have I don't think it is very good. It's okay but lets put it this way I watched it once and it's been on the shelf ever since!"
1,don't waste your time,"I gave this film a shot, by watching sitting though all of it.. I really thought it was one of the worst lesbian films I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the script was bad and the story line was even worse. There was no good parts to this film and really I can't see how it made it to dvd."
1,Unbelievably bad!,The directing is awful. The acting is awful. The script is awful. It was one of the most painful movies to watch. 'Nuff said.
3,Not really sure.,This movie had the potential to be better. I read what it was about and thought it would be played out differently. Some of the actresses were really good. It came across as more juvenile than I thought it would be. I'm in no way trying to be mean. I just expected something different. I wanted it to be better.
2,Circus Big Top Clowns,"Two tarnished stars for this dog. One star for the bad acting and script, and the other because it was like watching a terrible car crash in action. You just had to see what happened next and how freak-showish it could possibly get. An anthropologist who studies weird tribal customs might like it. I watched it with four friends and they booed and tossed popcorn at the screen. I had to clean the mess up, following this mess of a movie."
3,Indifferent movie,"I did not finish watching this movie, so I cannot say whether or not I enjoyed the entire movie, but the first half of the movie was very outdated and very slow-paced."
1,Not good at all,The holes on these lint trap are way too big.It is letting all the lint passing thru. I find out too late and can't get this returned.
1,Twice the Price of Cingular,An almost identical product is available from Cingular Wireless for only $39.95.
1,"good cast, wasted","This is an attempt to follow up on ""High Noon"" where Tex Ritter's singing vocals highlight the action on screen very effectively. Here they have built a low budget Western movie around a Western song that Tex Ritter had recorded, the title of the movie. They attempted with an interesting cast to piece together a movie on the theme but it is done dreadfully. Better this movie be forgotten and the song as recorded be remembered."
3,Very good new sound.,Just heard them at MySpace.Very easy to listen to. Fresh new sound with nice (not great) vocals.
3,Helpful for ideas on complete rooms,"Categorized into rooms,(aka living, bedroom, dining) this book starts off demonstrating how the painting of existing furniture can accentuate a room. In some photos, everything is monochromatic, in others - brightly decorated with bold colors and patterns. All photos are color, and show the entire room. Complete instructions for each project are in the back, along with some stencil patterns used.If you're looking for a primer on faux painting, this isn't it though. It does cover antiquing & crackle finishes.I liked looking through it, but there's nothing really impressive. ..."
2,not what it seems!,I ordered this book because the title says Painted Furniture and most of the book was about everything but painted furniture! What a disappointment!
1,Not worth purchasing.,"This book has such basic instructions, it would be more for a young student.For example, the porch swing directions;""Paint with white paint. When the paint is dry, sand the areas that would normally show some wear so that some of the brown stain is visible.""Really? That is the instruction?Additionally the book says that sources for paint and stencils are on page 111.I looked up the bench with cherries. No stencil source only paint colors.It is an older book, and I didnt purchase it new. So the designs are pretty dated.I'll continue on my search for the perfect guide for painting reclaimed furniture."
1,Do Not Subscribe Never Ever,"I am subscribing the magazine, Forza from early this year. However I could receive only two copies (43 & 44) - eight issue per a year. I called and wrote several times. The only one I got from ""Extreme Unkindness"" Abby Toldrian and other woman was ""It's not my fault, I sent, and call post office. It's their fault"" They even do not reveive my call or refund my money. Is it the way what they do their business? I can't believe this. Do not subscribe their magazine!!!!! Even I gave one star, but I mean BALCK HOLE!!!!!kim"
4,Along Came Galileo,"This book was purchased for my 6th grade son. He read it in less than a week. These books are fun and easy to read. They give a background of the actual person and how they came to discover or invent something. We have several of the Jeanne Bendick books and now my 5th grade daughter is reading them. Unlike typical school science books spurting dates and names, we appreciate getting to know these inventors in this lighthearted manner."
4,Excellent Biography,"This excellent biography of Galileo effectively relates the cultural view toward science at the time. While the church then had staunchly supported preconceived notions regarding astronomy (despite Biblical references that did not concur with those thoughts), Galileo persevered in pursuing truth based on factual observations. Galileo was a role model for our present youth to continue to test scientific observations and draw conclusions based upon factual data rather than the reputation and popularity of other scientists and their views, however long-standing those theories may have existed."
4,funny for the right audience,"This movie won't appeal to all, but for the gamers out there, they'll think it's a riot. It has its highs and lows, like most indie films, but it's got a good heart."
2,really? 5 stars?,"I rented Unicorn City because the reviews were good and it was short, it would make a good video to watch on my Kindle Fire while walking on the treadmill at the gym. I was so lame! I think I lost some brain cells over the movie. Unicorn City is definitely aimed at the gaming generation, probably in there early 20's, not a general audience"
3,"Waste of time, quirky goofy idiotic fantasy fun","LOL,,, some of the other reviews stating ""waste of brain cells"", spot on. Some of the characters are good and the plot & story are unique (thankfully!), but overall we are sitting here with disbelief that we spent this time watching this movie. I give the writers, producers, actors, etc. credit for this movie, yet for our tastes this film was ""ok"", but not recommended."
2,prolonged story,"The book has some high peaks, but through out the whole book it gets pretty complex and you'll get lost in the sauce because it's all over the place from whom the author is talking about to what the characters are doing, I had to read some pages just to make sure I was following the same story. My advice is don't buy it read it at a library."
1,THE ONE STAR IS PUSHING IT,"NOW I DON'T WANT TO HATE ON ANYONE OR KNOCK YOUR HUSTLE, BUT THIS BOOK REALLY SUCKED FOR ME I HAD THE WORST TIME GETTING AS FAR AS I DID IN IT. THAT WAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I STILL HAVENT FINISHED IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!!!"
5,i loved this book...,"I read a lot of urban literature and this book is by far one of the best books i have read, once i picked it up i could not put it down and i finished reading it in less than 24 hours... I loved the different characters in the book and how they were so real.. I liked how everything was not what it seemed and how the story had different twists in it.. Jihad is a very talented writer and anyone that buys this book will not be disappointed... I look forward to reading Jihad's next book..."
4,ENTERTAINING.....!!!!,SHE'S ROBBIN' THE RICH TO GIVE TO THE POOR is misleading..but the overall book was phenomenal..I couldn't put it down. King Jihad is a real deep brotha. And I am glad that I was able to read another of his works (Gigolos get loney too). This is another of Urban Books many great novels.
3,"Ok, I Guess","Babygirl was a wierd book. I wasn't too fond of Jihad's first book, 'Street Life.' I did scan through the book. It had a lot of different characters in it, but as you read on, they all tie end at the end of the book. I know for a fact I wont read this twice."
5,beautiful music!,this is an amesome cd. i listen to it to put me to sleep and i love it. it is beautiful! i highly recommend this for winding down or relaxing at anytime during the day. its great! :)
4,A little hard to understand....,"First, I thought there were 8 books--there are only six. Second, 3 are for girls. This works well if you have equal number of girls and boys. We were boy-heavy and it didn't translate well to boys. Third, I should have read through all the books first (even though the directions say not to). It is not clear to 12 year olds when to turn the page and I could have helped. The books are tiny, which is actually kind of fun. Finally, the charades part of the game was impossible, even for the adults present. We had to adapt.All in all, it turned out to be a great idea for a Halloween party. Next year, we will do something similar, hopefully for the same price (which was modest). The kids loved this idea! This particular product would probably be better suited for adults, although the kids were brilliant in figuring out ""who done it!"""
3,Not as big as I thought,"I was hoping these were bigger than the Gerber bowls I have for our toddler, but they are the exact same thing."
2,Not so advanced,"We do word of the day, everyday during the school year, and to be honest I don't think this is a great book, especially for kids eight and up. We can't find many of the words that we choose for the WOD (word of the day) so we end up looking them up on the internet -- the reason I bought this book was to NOT use the computer every time.This seemed like the best children's thesaurus so I guess if you want something useful just get a regular thesaurus."
5,Invaluable Resource,"This book is an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs dealing with the age old challenge of raising capital to form or grow a business enterprise. It is very clearly written and is filled with useful, practical and pertinent information and suggestions. The author does an excellent job of framing the issues and exhaustively reviewing the alternatives available to entrepreneurs. I would certainly recommend this book to those considering launching a business - it is sure to open their eyes to ideas and opportunities they had not envisioned."
3,easy to understand,easy to understand / focuses alot on borrowing from family members / was hoping for more than that/ but easy for anyone to read
2,already bent,"We got the tent right before a Memorial Day Holiday soccer tournament. By the second time setting it up one of the cross bars will not hold up and bends inward when you use it. Very disappointed, it looks great out of the box but I have used other pop up tents before that lasted many seasons, not hours!!!"
1,Piece of Crap,The 1st time we took the tent out one of the bars were bent.Tent is very flimbsy.When we took the tent down 3 of the bars snapped into pieces..Tent is a piece of crap..DO NO waste your money!
1,A piece of junk,"We put this up for the first time and the center support broke off, and the whole thing collapsed and the polls broke off where the anchors go into the ground, and now the seller is refusing to return our money saying this has never happened to them. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
2,An OKAY book,"Before reading this book I knew that it would be an overview of the history of Vietnam with little details; and I assumed this book would be a good starting point for me to explore Vietnamese history, but it didn't do the job for me.The manner in which the author presented the order of events were confusing and very difficult to follow as it seems like he was jumping back and forth between decades/centuries. The grammar is untasteful and rough to my ears in spots of the book. The pacing of the book seemed inconsistent - he presented a lot of details in the beginning and the middle, but the ending was so abrupt and rushed...it didn't have any substance like the rest of the book.On another note, it seems as though there are not many Vietnamese history books that goes back in the 1800s (mostly starting with the Vietnam War) - so I appreciate the author for writing this book."
3,It would have gotten 4 stars but,"The previous reviewer made good points about this book, it's brief but gives the reader a general view about Vietnamese history. It's very organized and uses a classical essay style of writing. It's a scholarly book, quite obviously written as a textbook. And therein lies the problem.There are many assumptions that the author makes and he chooses to present them as facts. They may be scholarly assumptions but presenting them as facts is still misleading and therefore, wrong.If Mr. Woods had simply said ""It can therefore be assumed that ..."", I would have gone ahead and given his book the four stars."
5,and the story ends...but does it !!,"This is the conclusion to the story of the Zhirrzh and the Human conflict and after the first two book I was really looking forwards to finding out what happens, and I wasn't dissapointed. The first book was written from the Human point of view, the second book from the Zhirrzh, this book is written from both, and written superbly. This whole book is mainly a race against time to get both sides of the war to form a peace because the war was a big mistake in the first place. I had one complaint though, although the book was brilliant, the ending was a bit of a let down, but I wouldn't have been able to do any better myself. All in all, a brilliant book, and a brilliant trilogy..."
5,Fast paced and exciting!,"Once again, Timothy Zahn has created a masterpiece. In this final book in the Conquerors Saga, he manages to put all the pieces of the puzzle together in a dazzling display of fast-paced adventure. Where the first two books focused on the point of view of one of two cultures involved in the plot, this book brings everything together by involving several different points of view, cultures, and characters. The result is a fast-paced adventure that is sure to keep you on your toes up to the last page."
2,multiplex dwellers beware:,"This item is probably not going to work for you. There is so much interference from neighbor dwellings, and inhouse appliances that this has little chance of working well.I have tried two versions of this gismo. Both were reasonably priced, easy to install, and barely worked. I got such a weak signal that I can do no better than 16k on dial-up.Money down the drain - should have sprung for a hard wired phone company jack...."
5,Easy Jack 2 Wireless Jack Base Extension Unit,Easy Jack 2 Wireless Jack Base and Extension UnitWorks great and no problem with installation.
1,Useless,"Just does not work, except for the base station, where you can plug in a phone, and listen to a transmission full of static noise. Absolutely useless"
1,Can't recommend this product,"The number of positive reviews for this product surprises me.First, the pictures of the wireless jack: They don't show you that the underside is where you plug it into your wall socket. The problem is that the plug is so huge that it may cover the entire wall socket. If you have two sockets, and depending on how those sockets are arranged, you may lose access to the second one.So, ""I'll connect it to a surge protector or socket multiplier of some kind,"" you say. The manual tells you not to do that. I don't know why, but a surge protector probably interferes with the AC signal this device sends on your house wiring. Just a guess.Then, the manual doesn't tell you if Caller ID signals are sent from the phone company jack to the jack you extended with this device. You can find out empirically...but I never got that far. My unit failed after about an hour. I returned it and got a refund...but it was a bad omen. I won't get another one."
3,Easy Jack--Fast & Easy Set-up,"Needed this to provide remote phone line hookup required by Dish Network for download on account. Easy to set up---worked right away--failed a couple times since, but comes back on without adjustment???"
5,Great product for an even better price!,This product worked just as well as the other products in it's category at almost a 1/3 of the price!! I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to convert an A/C jack to a telephone/data port.
1,Phonex PX-211D .... totally not worth even a dime.,"I bought the Phonex PX-211D Wireless system about 3 months ago, it has already quit working.The light on the main unit will not even come on red or green. Totally useless system, would not recommend to anyone. Will try another brand next time. We have to use these for DirecTV.Again don't waste your money on any Phonex product, as you will regret it........Aubrey G P."
1,Nothing but static,"No matter in what room and to which outlets I connect this System, the static interference is unbearable.Will have to return this item, because it does not serve its purpose."
3,product works as a phone jack for my security system,"Product works as a phone jack for my security system. I had to try several different electrical outlets for the sending unit since some outlets didn't work. Also, when testing the product with a normal phone I could hear a hum in the phone. The phone was usable but not as free of background noise as a normal phone."
1,Unreliable.,This product does not maintain communication between the base unit and remote unit. Constantly crashing and when reprogrammed will work only for a matter of minutes. Replaced with a similar GE product that works fine.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Easy Jack 2 Wireless Jack Base and Extension UnitI was warned by one other reviewer, but he wrote his in 2007. I hoped that Amazon might have cleaned up the description. But no, I ordered and received the DATA ONLY model. Mine is clearly labeled DATA ONLY, but not on the box labeling.Amazon is good enough to let me return it for a refund. I will need to shop elsewhere to locate one of these for my Voice phone extension needs."
2,Be careful which one you choose,I wanted this to create an extension for my voice line. It turns out this model (PX-211D) is for data only. You need the PX-211V for voice.
1,DIDN'T EVEN GET A YEAR OUT OF IT!!!!!,"Worked great for the first 8 months...then one day ordered a Pay-Per-View and couldn't dial out. I checked all connections at wall outlets and phone cords, everything was good. Contacted Dish technical and did more testing. NOTHING...determined it was this product. For the price you would have thought I coulod have at least gotten a year out of it. I bit the bullet and reinstalled a hard wire phone cord. It works fine. The concept is great...BUT only is it works...I wouldn't buy this OR recommend anyone buy it."
3,Not suitable for internet use,Will not support the internet. It will allow my computer to connect (after a long wait) but it will kick you off before a page loads.
2,Mediocre,"While this unit does exactly what it says... i dont think i would recommend it to anyone. i am using it for a simple phone line, and the static created by this unit is so loud and strong, that it almost makes the phone useless."
2,Not for fax use,I bought this to use with my printer/fax but it would not send faxes;only receive them. Cheap!!!!!!!!!
5,great item,Bought this to get a phone line to a satelite TV receiver. It is simple to use and works great. I didn't have an electrical outlet near a phone line anywhere near the receiver. I plugged the base unit into an electical outlet in the master bedroom on the first floor and plugged the phone line into it. The extension unit plugged into an electrical outlet in a room on the second floor and the receiver plugged into that. Works great.
4,Wireless Jack,Great product and is performing as hoped. This proved to be an excellent solution for my DISH network box being located away from a wall jack.
2,Line noice is a problem,"I've owned these before, but for whatever reason, this batch had so much line noise that I had to return them."
1,Horrible,"These seemed like a great idea, however the range was horrible everything after 10ft was a trial, Directions say surge protectors reduce quality, Units would not even link up while in them. Gamers -- STAY AWAY. When checking the remote units the lines had a lot of noise. This also goes for the PX-212 add jacks they were just as bad. My only real advice save your money and keep shopping."
1,useless for telephones,"The Phonex PX211 EasyJack wireless phone extension was supposed to create a phone jack when plugged into any electrical outlet. I followed the simple directions but it did not work at all: no dial tone when the extension was plugged into any outlet. Perhaps it was because it had ""data only"" printed on the back. If there is a version for regular phones, buyers should be warned. Fortunately I got my money back."
1,Not Designed for VOICE phone,The description does not say it - but this devise will not work on a phone you use for voice calls. It will have nothing but static.
3,no use,"I bought this product thinking it will solve my alarm system's problem, but it doesn't. So right now it's sitting there without use! And I can not give it a fair evaluation. Thanks!"
3,Marginal overall quality. Works but barely.,"I bought a pair of these units for use with FAX machines. The sound quality is okay, but there's huge amount of noise injected into the sound stream. These things pickup everykind of noise within 200-feet of them. Motor noise, flickering fluorescent lamps, spark noise, 60-cycle hum, they're like magnets for electrical noise. The FAX works but frequently the machine will abort the transmission or reception of a FAX."
1,Dissatisfied,"I ordered this product to wireless accese my Tivo, from one floor of my home to another, a distance of 18 feet and the product did not work. It would not pick up the signal from the base unit. I tried closer locations, but it still didn't work. I had to get a different brand locally and that worked fine. Now I'm stuck with one that doesn't work and no way to return it."
2,"Great concept, Just not good enough","I bought this for my daughter's room because she didnt' have a phone jack and I thought it clevor to have a wireless one since kids change their rooms around all the time. We were pretty excited about the concept, however, it doesn't work well at all. It's a bunch of static. Can hear the other person, but definitely something wrong with the Jack. I wouldn't recommend it nor spend that much on it. We didn't return it because what a hassle to return and pay for shipping again and my daughter was just excited to have the phone working."
1,Beware of surge protectors,"In common with other reviewers, I received the 'Data' version of this product, but as I was planning to use it for a fax, that should probably not have been an issue.Easy to install, green lights on both units immediately.The fax test routine (HP 5610 OfficeJet) was initially successful, albeit with a lot of noise on the line. However, subsequently the noise on the line prevented the fax from starting. A total failure. Reading the various indications from the manufacturer, this is almost certainly caused by surge protectors (there are two in reasonably close proximity - same room, different outlets).Alas I no longer have the packaging, so cannot return Easy Jack.Good news is that 'MagicJack' seems to work without problems, although not officially supported for fax use. More expensive in the long run, but gives a separate fax number also.magicJack - No More Phone Bills - Free Local & Long Distance Calls!"
4,Wireless phone setup,"This product works reasonably well, but the transmission range is rather short and not very strong. Periodic interferences on too regular a basis."
3,Product Evaluation,The Phonex jack and extention are noisy and distorted. I believe they need to be shielded to prevent electrical disturbances.
2,Phonex Wireless Web Jack System,"I purchased the PX-211D on July 27, 20010. I followed all instructions hook it up and it worked just until Oct 3. Then it stopped working. Two months of service is makes this unit a bad investment."
1,Phone kept ringing,"We set up the Easy Jack and it went very well, very easy to install. It seemed to work fine and then it started ringing and no one was on the line and the caller ID did not indicate anyone had called. So we returned the item."
4,Works Fine,I needed this to provide dial tone to my Direct TV reciever. It works fine and the transmitter is not even plugged into the same circuit as the receiver. I put the transmitter in the kitchen and the receiver is in the bedroom. You can hear a little static if you use a phone but the receiver doesn't care. The updates have been fine.
1,Phonex Wireless Web Jack PX-211D,"Maybe I just got one made on a Monday or Friday, but neither I nor two other people could get this to function with my DirecTV DVR receiver, We followed all instruction to the letter, both for set up and troubleshooting. The flashing lights are impressive, and can lead you to believe you're doing something. But alas, ""HAL"" is neither foolproof nor incapable of error. If you need frustration in your life, buy this item. It's found its final resting place in the back of the junk drawer."
2,More info on trouble shooting would be great.,"I purchased my units for use with a Dish Network Receiver. They were installed per the instructions and were green in no time flat. Using a handset I was able to hear the dial tone loud and clear however when I tried to dial out, I could not. I attempted to hook the phone line directly to the Dish receiver and it would not dial out either. I moved the PhoneX units to different locations and had the same problem.I swapped out the phonelines on both ends.Yes they were plugged straight into the wall.Turning to the instruction pamplet, if they're green they work not much else in the way of troubleshooting. I ended up purchasing a similar RCA model locally that worked out of the box."
2,Static,"While the price was reasonable, disappointed in the amount of static on the line. Would not purchase again."
2,be careful,"If you are a novice to this type of system, I suggest you do more research before buying. The premise is a good one but there are two types of this system. One for data only and one for voice and data. I needed the voice/data type and so this one, since it is data only, was not a good choice for me."
1,WARNING:THIS FILM IS NOT LETTERBOXED!,"A word to the wise: those purchasing this video hoping to have a letterboxed version of ""Mikey and Nicky"" will be sorely disappointed. It was not SHOT widescreen. It was shot in the standard 1.33:1 ratioThe one-star rating refers to the false advertisement, not the film itself, which is a five star classic. A full fledged review will appear another time.Still, it is a pretty good transfer."
3,How Did This Film Go Unoticed??,"I Personally belive this film shows the gritty side of 1970'scrime world in great detail. Nickey, a nervous wreck thinkssomeone has put a contract out on his life, calls upon his buddyMikey to help him as the two pair go on long night of tearing upthe streets and smokey bars and realizes their deep betrayal with every turn. Throughtout this film it sometimes resembles1973's Mean Streets but not quite as good but holds it's ownwith it's restless, edgy style."
3,So-so crime drama,"John Cassavetes (Nicky) and Peter Falk (Mikey) are two small-time hoods; Nicky is about to be bumped off by the mob and goes to Mikey for help. But Mikey is an ambiguous character who seems to be helping Nicky, but really isn't. Nicky gets it in the end--right on Mikey's doorstep. There is very strong acting by Cassavetes and Falk, much of it apparently improvised, though much of the movie has a very stagey quality to it: lots of dialogue in set scenes, not much action. Ellaine May directed, though not very well. Forgettable."
3,"Too focused on features, falls down on basic accuracy","This saw has a lot of great features. It is well thought out and well designed, but it has basic accuracy problems that make the saw poorly suited to highly accurate trim and finish carpentry. My criticisms echo many of the same made against Bosch 4410, 4412 and 5412 miter saws. Two deficiencies were apparent right out of the box. On my saw, the fence is not straight. It appears to bow concave relative to a straight-edge by about 1/4th of a millimeter. Also the 45 degree detent on the left side is accurate, but the one on the right side is off by about 1/2 of a degree. For a higher-end miter saw, the casting and machining should be more accurate than this. Other miter saws that I own (Makita) do not have these inaccuracies."
4,Great saw but...,"Dead on accurate. I don't agree with some of the other reviews on this subject. The dust bag is USELESS when working with MDF but seems to be fine with hardwoods. Had to return the laser two times and it still doesn't work, so I gave up and purchased an after market model. Much better that the Dewalt."
5,"Beautiful, precise saw at an unbeatable price!","I just got mine today ($3.99 next day shipping with amazon prime). This saw is perfect right out of the box. Construction is first rate, as would be expected from a bosch product. The up front bevel lock is a great convenience. The only thing I didn't reallize is that the laser does not go on unless the blade is spinning...minor issue. Otherwise $469 for the saw, now with a free jigsaw by mail and Dewalt saw instantly....there is no better deal out there. Amazon prime is awesome...if you need tools fast, it pays for itself after one purchase."
3,"Buy the 10"" model - Bosch Rules!","I own the 10"" model of this saw and love it. When I was looking to upgrade from my old Dewalt 12"" I was lucky enough to talk to someone who pointed out to me precisely what some other reviewers here mention: You are going to get a LOT more deflection (blade warp) with a 12"" blade. Another great point - 10"" blades are lots cheaper than 12"". I have yet to find myself going - damn, I wish I had gotten the bigger saw. With the sliding feature I can cross-cut anything up to the point where I should be using a radial arm saw anyway. I use the saw for both framing and finish and get perfect cuts. As for that old Dewalt - it has been demoted to chop saw for plastic and metal, which is about all it ever was good at."
5,Buy this saw if you are a professional,I can do nothing but commend Bosch for this miter saw. It's the best on the market in my opinion. I recently used it to cut 4 x 10 and 4 x 12 cedar beams for an entryway. It performed like a champ. Don't waste your money on less. This is the real deal.
5,Bosch Quality Again,"I really like Bosch products, have always been impressed with their quality, and this is no exception. It's a great saw and you can't beat the upfront controls and the extra angle capabilities. As always (with just about any miter saw) the dust collection system is present but non-existent. Other than that, a great saw and a great value."
2,"Hate that it disappeared, glad its gone.","One thing I'd wished I'd known before I bought the saw was that it won't cut 5.25 speedbase upright. After thinking about this some, I realized that its heavier and more expensive than the 10in saw, but no more useful.Bought the saw to build my personal house. Loved the features such as the up front controls, included clamp, and side extensions, but I always had problems getting it set to perfect square in any axis. Even when it was set as close to correct as possible, the blade would not cut strait up and down. The scale was not precise in any direction, but after practice I got it to work. It worked great during framing because it would cut through any width I was using and the laser was close enough to within about 1/8in. It got stolen at about 3/4 the way through the trim portion of the house and I replaced it with the new Milwalkee. At that point I realized how bad it really was."
3,slop in bevel,"Have had this saw for a little over a week, and was pleasantly pleased with it. But I found that there is a lot of play in the slide rails from side to side(bevel) The loose side is the side where the slide clamp is, and when you loosen it you can move it side to side a couple of degrees, and of course if you tighten the slide clamp then the slide funcion is useless. Just wonder if there is an adjustment for it, if not I will be trading this is for the 12 inch makita.On the upside the tool has plenty of power, the slide action itself is smooth, controls are user friendly, I won't comment too much on the blade because I always put a freud on my saws."
2,5412L is Geometrically Challenged,"The tool salesman at my favorite hardware store showed me how the Bosch 5412L slide mechanism is geometrically out of alignment. At zero degrees miter, slide the saw forward and align a square between the back fence and the left side of the saw blade. Next slide the saw to the back. Notice the quarter inch gap between the left side of the saw blade and the square. For any sliding compound miter saw over $500.00 I would expect no gap. How can Bosch sell such junk and expect the Bosch name to be respected?"
1,"How do you spell ""Taiwan""?","After the glowing reviews above, I went to the local Home Depot to check this saw out before buying it. To my dismay I discovered that the saw is made in Taiwan and reflects it in the feel of its craftsmanship, despite what the people at Bosch would have you believe by touting the 'Bosch' name and the ""made in Germany or Switzerland or USA"" that it implies. If you're a Norm-wannabe, buy this saw and you may be happy with it. To others who cringe at the thought of ""Asian import"" and ""quality tools"" used in the same sentence, run--don't walk--from this tool."
3,"Great Saw, Bad Designed On Dust Blower","Bosch's could get a five star if they'll reexamine the way they designed the dust blower. After the cut, it's only 20% of dust go inside the bag, the rest are around the saw and you can't even see the miter & bevel scale adjustment. Bosch dust bag are useless compare to Dewalt saws. This saw made in Taiwan so they've used a cheap screw on the back of blade adjustments. Therefore, be careful when you do a 45 degrees blade adjustment."
5,I Waited Just Long Enough,"This is my first miter saw and I am very pleased. For 30 years I have used a 60's vintage Craftsman 10"" radial arm saw. I got tired of having to set it up every time I wanted to get an accurate cut. I've been recovering an above ground deck with composite and have needed to make 15 +- degree cuts on a lot of boards. I decided to bite the bullet and spend the money on a good saw. The reviews on Amazon said this is the best and Bosch's free jigsaw promotion combined with Amazon's price closed the sale. Amazon delivered before promised. I also bought a 12"" True Angle Finder and it was wonderful to measure the angle, cut the piece and have it fit every time."
5,Best in Class by far!,"I read several reviews, spent over 40 hours of research in comparing DeWalt, Hitachi, Ridgid, and Bosch. I'm a loyal DeWalt user of multiple tools, but have recently been impressed with Ridgids lifetime warranty and own a few other ridgid tools that hold up very well. But Hey, we're talking about sliding miter saws aren't we. This is the smoothest most accurate saw I've ever used. I love it. My DeWalt was a 12"" but not sliding and it has a little kick when it starts. The bosch starts up smooth and continues to run that way. I have nothing negative to say but one comment to add. I did purchase the DeWalt 723 Heavy Duty Miter Saw Stand. The Bosch mounting holes are offset and therefore I had to bolt down some wood and then put the saw on top and screw it into the wood, so if you want a stand you might think about the Bosch stand, however I think DeWalt has the edge on overall stand features."
5,Best Saw in the World,"I have worked as a carpenter and Industrial Arts teacher for over twenty-five years. I have used many miter saws and recently, many compound sliding miter saws. This one, by a wide margin, is the best one I have ever used. The controls are intuitive and the scales readable. The manufacturing is first class. This is the saw I decided to purchase for myself. I highly recommend this excellent saw."
2,Blade wobbled on a $600 saw!,"Initial quality on the saw was great... until I used the saw. The bladed wobbled so bad that the whole machine shook. I called Bosch technical support and they gave me no advice except to return it to where I bought it from. Some help! I am not even convinced that that there is not a simple fix, but since technical support provided no SUPPORT, I guess I'll return it and hope the next one is better."
4,Bosch saw better because of service.,"Hi!I have used this saw and agree that it is well intentioned but needs to be better manufactured.I did want to say that I manage a hardwood importer distributor that supplies contractors. About a year ago a carpenter that had a problem with his Bosch table saw was nicely surprised when the Bosch company responded to his call by sending a replacement that arrived the same week. This saw was 4 years old. One thing I'll give Bosch is they value their customers. Try getting an answer to anything on Hitachi's web site or via cutomers service number(I've tried, believe me!)I've owned several miter saws and many more power tools.Very few of them are perfect . When there is a problem with a tool costing several hundred dollars a company that is client oriented makes a huge difference.Because of this I am going to be giving Bosh products a lot harder look when I purchase tools for company or personal use.Good luck!"
1,JSF CONSTRUCTION,"THIS SAW HAS GREAT FEATURES. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT CAN'T CUT STRAIGHT. IF YOU TRY AND CUT ANYTHING OVER 3"" WIDE, YOU GET A WAVY CUT. FOR $600 I NEED THE SAW TO CUT TRUE. I JUST SENT IT BACK AFTER WAISTING A LOT OF TIME..."
2,Frustrating.....,"It's difficult to tell whether it was the band or it was the engineers of the performance but the audio to this DVD is [poor] The horn section sounds like it's a quarter-beat off the entire performance! It also sounds like they ran the monitor mix and not the PA mix. At some times it seems like you can't hear any instrument at all and then voila, it's right in your face, over-bearing. Fela is great and I love his material (all eras) but this DVD is nothing but a dissappointment to me. Some reviews here rip on the track choices... koay, they're not my favorites either but they're still great tunes on their own. The problem is the audio that you're ""hearing"" on this DVD....Please save your money and purchase his CDs or vinyl instead..."
4,Very good.,"It was very good, considering it was the 2nd time I had read it. I will probably read it again next year."
3,Self-Imposed Madness,"Of all the BBC movies I have purchased, this was my biggest disappointment. To watch a man destroy himself and his family over a dillusional jealousy was depressing. Good acting is why I gave it three stars instead of two."
3,Who was right?,"Very enjoyable costume drama, rather hard to tell some of the characters apart at times; really delightful character parts by David Tennant as the flirtatious vicar and Anna Massey as the Aunt"
1,Not worth owning,"For those of you who fill your shelves with BBC period films because the plots are more complex and cleaner than today's fare, don't bother with this one.There is nothing redeeming about this film aside from excellent production values. The main character is intent on misjudging his bride throughout the movie and the whole production winds down into a depressing and uninspiring death scene. There is no moral high-ground here, no lessons to be learned to make the hours worth spending, not even the mildly endearing subplot can rescue this dismal storyline.I love period films, but I wish I hadn't bothered to pay for this one. I agree with the reviewer who suggested you rent it if you MUST watch every period film out there, but if the responses of those who have borrowed this film from me are any proof, they hated it as much as I do. I've stopped offering it to those who come by to borrow films."
2,"Wonderful production value, bummer story","I am a BBC devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic BBC storytelling and visual feasting. However, I was only partially correct. It is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly. I left the film feeling robbed, disappointed, sad, and a bit unfulfilled. I viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money."
1,Downer,Very disappointed! What a downer. I am so glad there were sub plots otherwise it would have been a worthless mess! I do not reccomend this movie. It is frustrating to watch it. The way it is advertised to get you to buy it is deceiving. If I had only known what the outcome was to be I would have never bought this one. It's so sad you won't want to watch it a 2nd time. Borrow it from a library or a friend who is dumb enough to buy it like me!! Oh Well
2,"depressing, no reason to keep watching","dealing with insanity is very frustrating, because of course it isn't logical and yet the people around a crazy person keep trying to use logic to deal with an illogical person.Depressing to watch, finally quit watching, there are many other more interesting series to watch. Buy some old videos of the Pallisers, for instance."
3,A great story IF...,"...if you don't mind heroes dying, left and right, from utter stupidity.The General's son, mighty warrior, now the General himself... but completely idiotic. Nobody in the story notices how dumb they are, and perhaps the writer doesn't notice either.But you and I can't possibly miss it."
3,really good at some parts others erm...,"Actually I felt that the story at the beginning had a lot of potential. I kept reading page after page wanting to know what the ""gift"" actually was. Got to that and I almost laughed. Okay it was an interesting plot twist, but i felt unsure of it at the same time. I felt that the main character didn't use the ""gift"" wisely in some situations (i.e) when he's alone with the enemy to his advantage. Celimus himself is a hatable character not just because he's the bad guy, but because he's sooooooo one dimensional. It's also upsetting when main characters that seemed just seemed to be fleshed out were quickly discarded to move on to a new one or a ""new personality."" I'm still going to read the next one because it has the potential to be good, even though I depised the ending chapters."
1,Myrren's Grift,"This was often a great read, but I hate the interspersed and ulitmately brutal use of the characters. Not to take away from the author: there are many successful writers who's stories deflate you. And for many people that's fine. I guess I'm looking for stories that intrigue, engage *and* make me feel good.So if you like getting sucker-punched in the gut, or groin as the case may be, have at it."
1,Lacks depth,"A bright idea that could have been handled better by an author with some basic understanding of the word ""characterization"".Fast paced? Certainly. But at the end of the ride, you wonder why you bothered."
1,built up as something it is not,"A page-turner this is NOT.After receiving the trilogy for Christmas I thought I should stick with it to the end but every time my hopes were built up that the story would go somewhere * Anywhere * my hopes were crushed continually as the protagonist Wyl, would once again become an indecisive twerp leaving me trying to like the secondary characters McIntosh did NOT kill off for no reason other than to make some lame attempt to drift into Steven King's penchant for the macabre. I've seen worse on the six-o-clock news! The underlying idea of the story and the blurb promised much. What a shame."
3,Unanswered questions,"At first I thought I might be disappointed that this wasn't a Benni Harper tale, but was soon relieved of my worries. It's a good, solid book that's well written and fleshed out. There are some things that still bother me even long after finishing the book - and one of my concerns was even addressed by the protagonist within the storyline. Why, if the patriarch of the family could afford to retrofit the structure of the high school (which Ruby even mused must have cost millions), was the family ranch in such dire financial straights? There were no answers and the reader is left to wonder. Why even bring it up if it's not going to be resolved?Also, editing could have been sharper. Troubling little things like the inconsistency of the name of the diner: on one page it's the Lone Pine then two pages later it's the Wagon Wheel.But Ms. Fowler is a great read, shortcomings and all."
5,The Saddlemaker's Wife,"As usual, Earlene Fowler has a wonderful mystery for us all. I am afollower of her books, and have enjoyed watching her mature in her writting."
2,Skip this one.,"This was a disappointing read. The best part of it was the title, which is probably why I picked it up.The book was pretty predictable, and the writing choppy and unimaginative. I kept feeling as though the author kept repeating herself, as if she wasn't sure she had made her point earlier. The characters were very one dimensional, never growing and lacking subtlety. I almost stopped several times but instead started skipping all the descriptive parts and skimmed through to find out the ending, predictable and unsatisfying. Lots better things to read out there."
2,"A soap, not a mystery","I bought this book (signed! -- any fans out there want it?)from my favorite mystery bookstore, The Poisoned Pen in Scottsdale, AZ, as a potential birthday gift for my friend who is from Bishop, CA, the thinly disguised Cardinal, the setting of this story. (I'd never heard of Benni until I looked up Fowler on Amazon.) I was hoping for an evocation of the gorgeous Owens Valley and the Eastern Sierra along with, perhaps, a mystery. The ""mystery"" in this story is a just a soapy family secret. Descriptions of the landscape miss the drama of the Owens Valley, which sits between the Sierra and the magnificent White Mountains to the east. I liked Birch and Bobby. I understand why there had to be the car accident to get the story out, but not why the nicest character had to be killed. ""The Saddlemaker's Wife"" is not well written, is sappy and sanctimonious, and is riddled with typos(whatever happened to editing and proofreading?). I still need a present for my friend."
1,A change of pace,"I own all of Earlene Fowler's books and have enjoyed all of them. This is book is a break from the Bennie Harper series. In it there is finely paced plotting. She has the ability to give depth to her characters, make you understand their motivations and care about them. She is a very talented and skilled writer."
4,Saddlemaker's Wife Review,"I would actually give this a 4.75 rating. Earlene Fowler did a terrific job with this book. It is different from her Benni Harper mysteries. I felt the emotions of grief and sadness throughout the book, and I could not put it down. You could feel as though you were a part of the story. It was so well written that I did not guess what the secret was behind Cole's trauma. That impressed me, because I can't stand when I can guess what happens before I even near the end. I finished reading it in 2 days, and I am hoping there will be a sequel. Even though there is a lot of grief and anger, you still sense the silver lining for the characters. So true to life. I highly recommend this book."
4,A Christmas read,"I read this book over Christmas vacation and thoroughly enjoyed it.The characters were all very believable and the story kept me engaged.I had no idea before about the business of making a saddle.In the book,I thought the author's descriptions of the landscape were great.The coffe shop ,Holy Grounds,along with its owner intrigued me.I especially liked the way the author ends this story letting you use your imagination for the real ending. I thought this was a great read."
4,THE SADDLEMAKER'S WIFE,"I enjoyed the story and the characters, but I really missed the little touches of humor that are an integral part of the Benni Harper books. Toward the end of the book, I was beginning to resent the continual sadness. I read to be entertained, and humor is a real part of that."
3,The Saddlemaker's Wife,"Nice title. Set in the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains, this fictional novel was a fairly fast paced book. The book was not overly descriptive but it gave a sense of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, I would venture to guess that anyone that has actually seen them would think the description inept. The Western characters were form fitting to the novel. Where they well developed? They were developed enough to move the story along in a positive light. Some of the circumstances were predictable. The book did hold my interest to the conclusion. Not overly romantic, thank goodnesss. A good story. I'd read it again."
5,Great cast of characters,"I chose this because I am so fond of Fowler's books about Benni Harper (which grabbed me because of the quilts in the titles, even if they aren't really about quilts ..). And I liked it a lot. The plot is interesting, the ending is surprising without being outlandish, and once again Fowler has assembled and described an interesting and endearing case of characters. A good read."
3,Light Read,I found the town of Acorn Hill to be sweet and endearing the kind of town you would like to live. I enjoyed Alice and her sisters. But it's kind of boring read...not much of a plot. I was looking for something more along the lines of the Mitford Series by Jan Karon or Harmony Series by Philip Gulley; this book was not even close.
1,Contains BPA/ Bishpenol A !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just wanted to inform all parents out there that this product contains BPA/ Bisphenol A. I returned mine. Pacifiers,bottles,breast pumps can have BPA in them as well such as the AVENT products that I returned. I then decided to go with Born Free bottles and sterilizer,Soothie pacifier and the Gerber Nuk pacifiers,and Medela pump. All their products are BPA Free. You do the research and decide if you will buy or continue to use their products. I've already written the President, my senators, and Oprah. Hopefully together we can keep our children safe."
3,Meanders along,"I have to give the makers of Aakrosh credit for tackling a very difficult subject - honour killings.As for the movie, it is a bit of a copy of Mississippi Burning and even lifts some scenes directly.Why Bollywood film makers insist on copying ideas shot for shot, I will never understand and this is something that affects the film. If the film makers would only be original rather than copying the Bourne films (and others) then maybe this film and others would be more original and more entertaining."
5,This is the book for programmers,This book gives a nice intro to SVG for those individuals who will be writing software that uses SVG. This book is not so nice for designers.
3,Not enough explanation,"Though this book does go through a lot of the different things you can do with SVG, I find that it doesn't give a full explanation of how certain parts of the code work. For example, when discussing the Bezier curves, the book doesn't explain much of the mathematics behind how the curves are created."
1,Save your money for Jr. Gong,Where's the substance? Rootsmen usually bring substance not bubble gum and tacky beats.
2,Just Ok,Theres 3 or 4 good songs on here but that's about it. Don't waste your money unless you can find it used for like $5.
1,Broken,"I was excited to get this CD! But when it arrived, although still in the plastic wrap the case was CRACKED! Two long cracks were right across the front!"
1,This book is HORRIBLE (Misinformation written all over it),"The beginning intro the C# is absolutely POINTLESS. The author should have spent more time on providing better examples and discussions of his design patterns.Pg 110: ""In both cases our events classes contain an instance of the base Events class, which we use to read in the data files.""Ok, the base Events class he is talking about has been declared as an Abstract class... and he is telling us that our derived classes contain instances of the base Events class? What is he trying to do, provide misinformation? You can't instantiate or have instances of Abstract classes!This is an utter waste of $..."
2,Nearly impossible to finish,"I personally found this a poor tutorial on design patterns and C#. The examples the author used were often contrived and reeked of needless complexity. The tutorial on C# was brief, incomplete and unnecessary (leave the task of teaching C# to a book of it's own). The code seemed to be ported from another language instead of being written with C# in mind (for example the use of a getName() method instead of using a Name property). If your looking for a tutorial on design patterns check out Robert Martin's latest book on Agile Software Development. It doesn't use C#, but it covers the classic GOF design patterns (plus a few others), explores XP programming and (in my opinion most importantly) covers principles fundamental to object oriented programming and design."
1,Pathetic,"Having suffered through the book to the end, I feel compelled to say what a pathetic disappointment.From the first few chapters it was amazingly clear that the author not only didn't have a firm grasp of C# but had almost entirely misunderstood .Net as well.Intermixed amongst some pathetically poor examples was a combination of editorial errors, mistakes and outright misinformation...I seriously hope noone who has read this book has taken it as an example of how to code, let alone code one of the GoF patterns in managed code.Even the descriptions of the patterns left much to be desired with even one of the simplest patterns, the Singleton not accurately represented.There is 1 saving grace ... it has a nice title :)"
2,What planet is this UML and C# from?,"The UML diagrams in the book do not follow the UML specifications. The author shows composition when he should be showing aggregation or association.The author also shows cycles of composition wich is invalid UML.Like other reviewers pointed out, proper C# was not used in the code examples. For example, no C# Properties were used anywhere in the book."
4,I lost the CD and can't use the book again.,This is a great book but after i lost the cd i can't use the book any more.How can I get the code examples again?baraks@ectel.com
2,needs editing,"the outline is great, and the chapters layout seem at first glance, attractive. Lots of code examples, but there are several typos that pretty much render it worthless: can't spend my time trying to understand something that has doesn't make sense because a typo makes it incomprehensible. Look at the last chapter, ""Visitor"", and look at the names of the subclasses in the figure: the editor forgot to replace the name of ""Shape"" with ""Triangle""."
2,Not up to par,"In addition to useless introduction to C# kind of section, the examples associated with design patterns are not intuitive, the writer did not do a good job with the examples. Anyone could come up much better examples to escalate the idea to the reader. There are code style issues such as method, interface and member naming that are not standard to C#, it seems like author transitioned from Java and wanted to carry on Java styling guidelines."
2,Examples and codes need improve,"As a _tutorial_ reader, I expected more easy to understand examples. For example, examples in Chapter 9 are not very straitforward.A lot of sample codes failed to use nice C# features.Good UML illustration. Good screen shots of programs. They are very helpful in quick understanding the intention of a design pattern.I give a 2 stars, lower than the quality of some Googleable on-line tutorials."
4,good book for c# developers,"Firstly, this book has a good introduction to the c# language, I am already quite comfortable with c# but I enjoyed skimming through this anyway.As well as the introduction to c# the book provides a good introduction to design patterns and has explanations + examples for 23 different design patterns.This is the first book I have read on design patterns and I am already using these patterns in my work.I do feel that the author is more comfortable with coding in java because none of the code examples seem to use properties, instead the author uses getters and setters which I think not good practice in c#.I recommend this book to any c# developers that don't know about design patterns yet. I obviously wouldn't recommend this book to java or c++ developers because the examples are in c#.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the formatting of the code examples is a bit messy, and the author hasn't stuck to c# best practices (using properties)."
1,Read Design Patterns Explained instead,"This book misses the point of patterns. It explains patterns as if they are solutions to recurring problems. Gee, I thought that's what they are? Well, they are - to some extent. They are more about a way to think. The problem with patterns as design solutions is that they don't help you until it is too late. Design Patterns Explained talks about why patterns are good solutions. You can then use this information on any project."
1,The worst book I ever read,It is the worst book I ever read. Subject matter is not explained properly. Examples are complex and lengthy. Don't buy this book.
5,Reunion with a gifted knitter,"Elizabeth Zimmerman is refreshingly witty and charming as she guides you through all the primary and advanced knitting techniques. The video close ups are excellent. She absolutely loves everything about knitting and her enthusiasm is contagious. This video captures it all as she takes you through her innovative shortcuts and helpful suggestions. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the many beautiful sweaters she created over the years. Old fashioned, perhaps; timeless definitely ! A must for any serious knitter's library."
1,Blimp overview,This product is intended for adults only. My son found this online because he loves blimps and wanted it to play with. The balloon that was sent was only for one time use and was way over priced for that purpose. My boy popped it within the first hour and was extremely upset. Also the balloon was NOT shaped like a blimp but like an egg. My advise for this product is DO NOT BUY IT!. I is way over priced and is completely NOT WORTH IT!!!! IT does not look like the picture AT ALL.
3,How fun !,"When I received this funny toys ""Party blimp"" , it is very easy to build & can be played soon.it is easy to control , I guess it can be play for my sun .He also feel so fun.although , it has some delay to delivery to me at the beginning of shipment.but Amazon supported to change delivery method , so it is few delay."
4,"""woman in the dunes"" moves to london","i enjoyed this bleak, absurd little novel. the notion of being marooned amid high-speed traffic is compelling and creepy, and maybe even possible. it's also a great psychological study, on par with abe's ""woman in the dunes"" with an almost inevitably similar ending."
3,They made a movie from the wrong book.,"Too bad ""Crash"" crashed at the box office, because it will probably repel most people from going any further into Ballard's books. Concrete Island is a little gem, featuring only three characters and a bizarre imprisonment, both physical and mental. At times morbid, at other times darkly cheerful. A peculiar little read, but memorable. I'll never think of carny acrobats in quite the same way again..."
4,Illuminates the thin line between savagery and civility,"In ""Concrete Island"" Ballard delivers a haunting urban fable that's better than ""High-Rise,"" more accessible than ""Crash,"" and charged with the author's trademark irony and psychological horror. ""Concrete Island"" opens with achitect Maitland bursting through a crash barrier and into a dessicated patch of land that has gone all-but-unnoticed by the city around it. Maitland quickly realizes that he's stranded, and the rest of the novel deals with his persistent efforts to escape and claim the ""island"" as his own before re-emerging into civilized society.""Concrete Island"" is an inventive and horrifying story that illuminates the thin line between savagery and civility as deftly as ""Crash"" dissected our collective fetish for the mechanical. Ballard's thoughts on the modern predicament are as insightful as they are chilling, and ""Concrete Island"" ranks among his finest visions."
3,seat cover,a little loose for my honda civic in the back. has attachable head rest covers but it looks retarded if you don't have detachable head rests. take into consideration before buying that it really is exactly as this one looks in the picture.
2,Needs some work,"There are multiple problems with this cover. The first problem is that it doesn't fit over a fixed car seat (if your car seat is built into the car and doesn't move/fold down it's ""fixed""). I had some help getting mine on (my brother just about tore out my seat to do it, ignoring the fact that it was attached) and with a flathead screwdriver (or your seatbelt) you can wedge the cover in enough to keep it on. The headrest covers are a joke and only work with a very specific type (not mine apparently). Overall I do like that this fabric is sturdy enough to spill on it and not worry about leaks but as a bench seatcover it will still leak through because of the openings for the seatbelts. Only worth it if you have really messy friends or kids that sit in the back."
1,Not for fix rear car seats,This cover will not fit on fix rear car seats. The one found in normal sedans.
2,be carefull,"I purchased this devcie and have had nothing but problems with it. The moment I got it out of the box it started resetting. I thought ok maybe it needs an upgrade. Looked on RCA.com to see if there is a firmware upgrade. Did it....loaded music and same thing. Well trying to get a hold of the RCA to do a warrenty exchange is impossible, well I am getting a refirb one now, lets see how this works. Good luck all....needless to say I a shopping for another devcie, that just left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Capable Whittington Western about man falsely accused,"Yet another tale of a man falsely accused of a crime trying to clear his name in a town where he is a stranger.Compares pretty favorably with another thriller of this type called High Fury. The plot hinges on the hero wanting to relocate to a town where he is distrusted if not hated and having to win over the populace against the respected yet feared powers that be in the town. Though the hero tends to be too good to be true, some of the other leading characters are well constructed, such as the young deputy who befriends then distrusts him, and the widow who confides in him."
2,All Bad,"My mom bought this Karaoke machine for me last christmas to replace my old karaoke machine (which still works, the speakers just buzz when on the tape setting). The sound quality was poor, the mics didn't work very well, and the songs just weren't very good quality. That, plus three of the CD's that came with it wouldn't even read.I suggest that you go with a better karaoke machine."
