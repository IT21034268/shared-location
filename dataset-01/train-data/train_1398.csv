4,Cook breakfast on your Coleman Grill Stove.,"I bought a Coleman propane two burner grill stove. The one with the blue lid. The grill part of the stove is for barbecueing only. If you want to fry eggs or cook bacon, for example, you need to buy this griddle to use in place of the grill. It is custom made to fit this stove and it works great. I tried using a flat griddle from the kitchen on the stove and it didn't work well. So buy the griddle."
4,An Echo of Hope,We were looking for stories by Dianna Crawford. We are very pleased with the book and have enjoyed reading it.
3,Replacement,My hairdryer died and had to find a new one and ager a lot of research and pricing. I decided on the Remington Pro Air Ionic Dryer. I find it to be a little on the heavy side compared with my old one but otherwise it has been nice. The low speed for drying is still a little to fast but other then that it is a nice dryer. I would buy it for family and friends.
1,Not a good choice. For a book to cover intro EE stuff,This book is not that great. Again the purpose of the book is to explain concepts and how to implement them. The author does a poor job. Consider borrowing this book.
4,Received in very good condition,The text book I got came in very good condition. Only the cover was a little bit bent and that may have happened during shipping.
4,good,"Arrived on time and in the condition stated. If you like SNL, you will enjoy this dvd because it has good skits on it."
4,Nice clean cuts!,"These pruners do a wonderful job. We've been using them every weekend (and some weekdays) since we've had them. Little effort is needed to cut through branches. It even does a nice job dead-heading my flowers. The blade is starting to show that it has been used, but we really have been using it a TON! Hopefully it will sharpen well when we take it to our sharpener!Happy pruning!"
3,Needs a better clasp,"I bought four of these alarms. One for each daughter, my mother and myself. The alarm is loud and effective. The two part deactivate is essential since it would keep a would-be attacker from quickly silencing the alarm. The flash light is handy as well. The problem is that 3 out of 4 of chains broke. Mine fell off and the light broke. I still carry it but it would be much more efficient if I could carry it on my keychain.So if they made a stronger keychain/clasp I would definitely buy another one."
4,Works great so far.,"Pros: Nice and loud. Small and compact. Easy to set off the alarm if I want, but not easy to do it by accident.Cons: Takes a somewhat unusual battery, but not that hard to find. Keychain is fragile, but easy to work around that by attaching a new keychain with glue or mounting tape to the actual body of the device."
4,great item,"Got this item for a blind friend so that she can feel safer on her walks. It does its job well: it's loud, it's easy to make it alarm if needed, and she had no problems finding the off switch after a short practice (it's hidden to make it harder for an intruder/aggressor to turn it off)."
4,good product,"It gives a sense of security. Mace can be used by an attacker on yourself. This product is good, the attacker cannot deactivate it fast enough. The sound is quite loud."
5,Reel this one in!,"Poems that revisit and reshape the myths that guide our lives and our culture. This collection records, with memorable imagery and striking lines, the lives of some of the Native American people the author grew up with. It also comments on the political events of our time. And, interspersed throughout are some of the most sensitive and down-to-earth and intellectual love poems you'll ever find. Don't let this book be ""the one that got away."""
1,Not the best version,"This is a great film, but do yourself a favor and buy the DVD version of this - the content and quality is superior."
2,Ridiculous,"If you're in the mood for ridiculous (but uncreative) humor then buy this. The prior two books addressed getting out of unlikely scary situations, and that made them vicariously exciting. But most of these situations are so normal that we've all dealt with them already. The ""helpful hints"" come across as Grandma's Home Remedies rather than the 007 Instruction Manual.Some hints are so obvious that you'd think they were written for an alien. For example, did you know that benzoyl peroxide can help with pimples? To stop a shaving cut from bleeding, apply a tiny piece of toilet paper. If you have an obsessive Ex, then be firm when rejecting them. Gee, thanks.Plus some of the suggestions are downright odd. My favorite is the drawing on p78 showing how to get down on all fours in a restroom to expel excess gas. They should've had a scenario for what to do if someone catches you doing that."
3,"Some interesting, some funny, some useless advice","Another in this series of self-hekp books...could use some updating for the Internet, and more date-specific advice, along with removal of solutions that one is very unlikely to need on a date. I found it interesting but not worth more than a quick read and discard."
3,Makes a a good gift book,"This book is funny, marginally informative and about as lightweight as air puffed popcorn. It is unlikely to be a repeat read for anyone and as such makes a good gift for the right person. The advice is suitably illustrated in a comic fashion and is best enjoyed read in the company of friends."
1,Not one of the best.,"Of the hats books I have read, this is the first from which I did not get a single good idea."
3,Falling in love again; never wanted to be alone. Sappy love story tarnishes another Sharpe installment,"Major Richard Sharpe is apparently the Marlene Dietrich of the Peninsula War. A ruthless and relentless killing machine who is just a sap for romance. Just a boy who cant say no. During his 5 years in Iberia, he as fallen truly, madly, deeply in love numerous times, often simultaneously, and ALWAYS to the detriment of Cornwells story. Sharpes Regiment is a splendid example of an author (and his editors) not knowing what heroes best.It's a shame too because there is an interesting story here, mucked up by a bad case of the puppy loves."
3,Blink and you'll miss the ending!,"Did she miss the post or what? This was written so fast, you could believe she had something burning in the oven at the time.The good points are bad guys that have an evil streak a mile long, but say goodbye to their iq around the last three chapters. Aurian just got further and further up your nose and could you pull her down? No!Anvar should by rights have died in book two, the amount of times that they had to backtrack through this whinging little git messing things up was phenominal. If these are the heroes saving the world in a hurry then we can only assume that they are using British Rail as the means of doing so.Slower than a tortoise on downers this is not one to be recomended."
4,What's next?,"Overall, I enjoyed the series, but as other reviewers have stated, the last book also left me waiting for more. Unlike her other series based on the Shadowleague, in which she ties up loose ends, this one seems incomplete. The death of the mage Eliseth was anti-climatic, and what happened to Sara? Did I miss her demise? I feel that she left too many loose ends, especially regarding the children of all the main characters, the Phaerie, the great cats, and Nexis, endng the book as if the finale is still to come. Is there any chance that we will meet the characters again in a new series? After looking forward to the completion of the series, I was disappointed."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment after such a wait,"The first and foremost thing that sticks out in my mind is that the author got locked down in her exclamations. After all the colorful ones in Aurian (I'm reminded of those involving Thara and Chathak, in particular), the ones in this book were dull. Most involved ""perdition."" Why in perdition, and where in perdition, and what in perdition. I was tempted to reread it just to see how many times this word was used.But that was just a minor irritation. I was most disappointed by the way things played themselves out. As someone else wrote, it just seemed that she wanted to get it finished before deadline. And on that note, let's just say that it wasn't finished. By leaving unfinished business in this novel, the road is paved to the fifth in the series. When will this end? I loved the first three books, but this one has to be my least favorite. Maybe the next one will be better, and stamp finality on the series."
2,Rather disapointing,I don't know how to discripe my feelings about this novel! I read the previus books and found that Dhiammara had problems to speed up. It went till about the middel of the story before it got quite interesting. And what about the end?? Just another clifhanger! Shall we wait another several years to see the real end of the story? After all Aurian was the best of the four books!!
3,This was not a Conclusion....,"The whole series was good,but the ending was so rushed that it was not a decent ending.Too many things were left unresolved,but it was still a good series....Good story to get caught up in.."
3,"Good resolution, but still needs a sequel","The main story is definitely resolved, and Ms. Furey resolves it in grand style....but there are several plotlines that aren't resolved, and that I'd like to see resolved - which is why this book rates only a 6. For example - I'd like to see Aurian confront the Phaerie and thereby resolve the situation with the Xandim. Also, what actually happened to the rest of the Great Cats? We only hear that they left their home - but did they leave or were they killed off, or what? A sequel to this ""conclusion"" definitely needs to be written, but for what it is, this book is excellent."
1,"Great Movie, Wrong Medium, Maybe Wrong Material","This DVD is ""Region 2"" format, meaning it is made for Europe and unlikely to play on US players. There was no warning of this until I opened the package.The label made it clear that removing the Region 2 warning and opening the jewel case would make it unacceptable for returning, so I am not sure whether or not the ""Red Headed Stranger"" movie is on the disc. However, the part of the package that I can see makes it seem very unlikely that it contains the movie. I bought this item because it is sometimes described as the Red Headed Strnager movie. But, it is also sometimes described as ""The Life And Times Of Willie Nelson"". Be careful!By the way, the movie is great if you enjoy Willie!"
2,There is NO movie!,There is NO movie. There is some good music but I have that music already. I was looking for the movie.
5,My favorite western from Willie,"I caught this western on Hallmark chanel and was very pleased with it (Except for all of the commercials) I hope to see it offered on DVD for a more reasonable price. Lots of action, and an interesting plot. A minister who goes bad over love gone wrong. Shows great contrast with the human condition good/evil - Love and hate. As well as good vs evil."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This book is not worth the price. It is written by an author from the UK and his concept of operational or ""operations"" auditing may be different from yours. The whole book is devoted to internal control. Each chapter provides a checklist of internal control questions for each business ""operation,"" what we in the US would call a system, i.e. purchasing, accounting, ect. Nothing new is presented in this book and the information it provides can be obtained from other sources at much less cost."
2,"Lame, tame, much the same","The misapplied metaphor and the meaningless adjective overwhelm this slight book pretending to be a serious examination of love and fathering. But besides the numerous inappopriate and gratuitous modifiers, there is nothing here. The conflict feels grafted on by an author who recognizes the dullness of his tale, the plot surprises would only surprise the comatose, and the predictability of the whole thing left me weary. A book for those who feel rather than think, for the feelings are all good in this. Nice man, nice boy, nice girlfriend. Nice make-believe story line.Nothing in here approaches real. Nothing is thought out. It is the harmless cotton candy of modern fiction, tastes great (in very limnited quantities) with no content whatsoever."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie!,"I purchased this movie thinking it would make a fine edition to my blaxploitation collection. However, I was most surprised to find that, instead of the majority of films in that genre, this was a serious, well-acted movie with an excellent plot. The story of a young man who set his sites on becoming a crime kingpin and succedes only too well is intelligently written and makes for a movie that takes us into the life of a career criminal. Gloria Hendry is superb and redeems herself from her campy portrayal in Black Belt Jones. I found myself captivated from beginning to end. I give it 4 stars only because the production aspect could have been a bit better, but they probably worked with a limited budget and made the most of it. Highly recommended as a look into the life of a young black man who decided to choose the criminal path and follow it to its extreme expression."
4,Good movie,"Black Caesar, Fred Williamson looking good as always, good actor, good old movie. I like it alot. Alway love seeing him in anything that he has worked on. thank u"
4,Awesome!,"I thought this movie had one of the best opening sequences I'd seen in a LONG time. It's a fun movie all the way through. If you're a fan of action from this era, this is essential. This is more like a ""Black Godfather"" than the actual ""Black Godfather"" movie. I recommend this to collectors and fans of this genre alike!"
3,Average.....at best Movie,"I love my classic 70s black movies. But my biggest reason for watching this movie was the sexy, sexy love scene between Gloria Hendry and Fred Williamson. Otherwise I wasn't inlove with the plot. I'll have to watch it again soon."
3,"""You see a bad mutha.""","Director Larry Cohen's (Hell up in Harlem) ""Black Caesar"" will definitely keep your interest, especially for fans of gangster films. The strong violence (shooting, beating, the abuse of women, etc.) may be a little strong for some, but it's really appropriate considering the subject matter and it gives the film a lasting impression. The important part of the film is its message. The downfall is that it takes its brutal time getting to it. The films few but powerful moments make it count. Fred Williamson is excellent as the crook who kills his way to the top. Little did he know he was going down the whole time. One of the more powerful films of the genre and worth the look and definitely the listen - as James Brown sings: ""Pay the cost to be the boss. Look at me, you know what you see? You see a bad mutha.""Trivia: D'Urville Martin(Director of the Dolemite films) appears here as the swindling evangelist"
3,3 Pianos Too Short,"After listening to Music for 3 Pianos, I found I wanted more. It's disappointingly too short. The moods created are not as synthy as found on Lovely Thunder or White Arcades, nor are they as upbeat as found on Luxa or Glyph. ""La Muchacha De Los Suenos Dorados"" is my favorite. Is is haunting and glowing and makes me think of a very large blue glass chandelier that is pulsating like a jellyfish. If you like the music of Erik Satie or the early piano of Roger Eno, or even John Field, you'll like this."
4,Music For Three Pianos,"No, it's not ""The Pearl"" of Budd's musical works, but it is enjoyable listening in places. I found some tracks laboring. The last track on the album is stunning."
5,Stellar comedy about True Love!,"Though a sizable read, I tore through A Singular Moment in one day, finding myself unable to pull away from the realistic, endearing characters and their humorous misadventures. In the vein of The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally, this book is both comedy and romance, as the main character is on a quest for true love. Not to mention, the author casts Sinatra as God, and throws in Dean Martin and Sir Lancelot for good measure!This book was great! Buy it, read it, love it!"
4,Country Favourites - My Favourites !!!,"It's a quite good Album, lots of old songs, nice cover versions. Even though those aren't songs written by Jimmy himself, they seem to sound different to the originals because of his great voice. He is a superb singer and songwriter (with some help of Kevin Sheerin) but started off doing cover versions. I think this Album is pretty good for one of his first releases (think it's his second album after ""The Grand Tour""). And all I can say is ""Well done Jimmy!""."
2,Off path,Not totally focused on the subject and leads to dead and options I would net recommend . Very disappointed and realize tou get what you pay for.
3,It is an interesting book but it seems more like a book to sell his product,He sells a moon phase chart that the book promotes and does not provide it and the book seems to be a way to sell his product.
5,"An amazing book, well worth every penny...","I've recommend this book to so many of my friends. It explains why that girl from your past went off with someone else, why your ex business partner ripped you off. More importantly it helps you become aware of who is likely to be like that in the future.Yes it's written by a Scientologist based on information gather by Ron Hubbard but why let that put you off, it's a sound well written book which helps you live a happier life. I mean that sincerely."
1,Loved the Title...Hated the Book.,"If I had known this book was based on a theory attributed to Scientology's L. Ron Hubbard I would have never considered paying $25 for a very used book.The book divides people into l6 personality types - twelve are fatally flawed - four not so much. Only the top two seem worth knowing and they are saints hence not too many walking around, at least in my neighborhood. There's a lot of qualifying of the types, so much so that you begin to wonder how you're ever going to spot these shapeshifters since it seems everyone except the saints are capable of being any of the other types depending upon circumstances.All in all a most intellectually unsatisfying read. And boring, too."
4,Marvin Gaye as good as it gets.,This was a really good Viedo of Marvin Gaye. I was really gratefull to all of the interviews they had in here with different people. Also some of the performances that were on this viedo were outstanding.
2,Not worth renting...,Acting is poor.... very very unrealistic even for Syfy... is not worth the cost of renting.. do not promote this
4,Great book not so great condition,The book is for a class I am taking and found it to be interesting but not material I would pick up for pleasure reading. The condition was said to be fair but in my opinion it was a bit more on the poor side. It had water damage and stiff pages but good thing the text was readable.
1,Defective; returned to sender,This CD 'Lo Mdjor de lo Mejor'(Enrique Chia) ordered second hand was unplayable. I returned it to the sender.
4,A Nice Surprise!,"Well, my wife and I weren't sure what to expect. We were pleased to see the quality of the pine. The boxes were beat up from shipping but they put extra pieces of wood in the ends of the boxes to help protect the wood. It arrived 98% ding free.The assembly was a bit of a challenge, about 2 1/2 hours for all pieces. The instructions were pictures, no words, so you have to pay attention. All of the pieces fit together rather well.The size of the set is exactly as we pictured. You can seat 5 adults without a problem. We are using it in our 3 season room.All in all, it's a bargain at the price, even though the shipping was more than $80."
3,KITCHEN CORNER NOOK SET,"We really liked this set. The finish and style is very nice and well made.It is also very comfortable. I rated this a 3 because of a missing part to the side bench and we are unable to assemble the bench. We have not been able to get any response from the seller. This is a shame because we can now only seat 3 to 4 adults, plus it doesn't look the same without the bench."
3,"Nice lightweight jeans, but they run BIG!","I ordered a size 10 (my normal size) and they were at least one size to big.I gave them to a friend who wears either a ""large 12 or small 14"" and they fit her perfectly."
4,Great Fit!,"I love these jeans. They are non-binding and comfortable. The only problem I had was with the length. I always wear petites, but these ran very short. If I order then again, I will likely order a regular size rather than a petite."
4,Lee jeans women's easy fit jean,These are great jeans for the woman who's a little bigger and a tad shorter than most. They're very comfortable and well made. I guess if there was anything negative about them is that they have a very wide leg. If you like your jeans a little more tapered at the bottom. I would opt for a different pair.
2,"I don't get it, apparently.","I am a big fan of Dan Clowes and Adrian Tomine, and I loved Epileptic by David B. -- but I just found The Push Man and Other Stories to be kind of pointless, with uninteresting artwork. The stories seem to aim to shock, but completely failed (in my case) to do so. I would absolutely not recommend. GetLike a Velvet Glove Cast in IronorIce Haven(by Clowes) orEpilepticinstead."
1,Fay's Shostakovich: Back to the Soviet Times,"[...]First of all, the language is dry and unimaginative. Second, the work lacks any considerable citations. In most of the cases, making statements, Fay doesn't care to cite the source. Consequently, there is very little we can discover about Shostakovich's personality in this book. Third, Fay ignores some considerable and valuable sources, like Shostakovich's letters to Glickman, as well as she questions the statements of Elizabeth Wilson's (Life Remembered) book.My first feeling, when I read this so-called biography was, that it was a merely English abrupted translation of the Shostakovich's Soviet biography by Sofia Khentova.Fay doesn't trust any letters or memories. On the contrary, she widely uses the publications of the Soviet officialese, including Shostakovich's articles and speeches, most of which were even not written by the composer himself!"
1,"Laughable, yet cruel","This book is an attempt to describe the life of a Soviet composer without reference to, or apparently any knowledge of, the conditions that the composer was working under. The author's obvious ignorance of the milieu created by the Soviet regimes under which Shostakovich worked results in a work of overwhelming dishonesty - one that cruelly misrepresents the composer and the works he created. This book is so misconceived, both from the standpoint of empathy for the subject and overall scholarship, that it would take several pages to address even its most blatant errors. Fortunately, for those who might be tempted, for whatever reason, to check this out of the library, or even, God forbid, to buy the thing, there is a website where one can read an intelligent and balanced discussion of the sort of feeble anti-revisionism that this book represents (see below). If amazon does not allow links, search for ""Music Under Soviet Rule: The Shostakovich Debate.""[...]"
5,Best Bio,"Laurel Fay's life of Shostakovich is authoritative: state of the art. It's admirably researched, well-written -- (no academic jargon) -- and absolutely necessary for anyone who wants or needs to know the facts about the composer's life, works and their reception histories. Two things that her book is not: 1) although it gives a good idea of what an individual work is like and how people of different kinds reacted to it, it is not a string of analytic essays; 2) although it can be quite interesting, even moving, about events and people, it is not a novel, much less a romance.The book gives a solid account of a fascinating period and one of the great artists of the 20th Century.I've found it necessary to own."
3,Workmanlike musicologist's review of Shostakovich's life,"This biography definitely adds to what we know about Shostakovich, but is somewhat academic.Historical accuracy is the goal at every point, and there is much clearing up of obvious falsehoods from other quarters. Not too much light shed on anything one couldn't already glean from other sources, except for precise dating, and cross-referencing of sources, which is of interest only to musicologists, and not the general public.A good book and a must-read for any Shostakovich aficionado, but not as good a read as Elizabeth Wilson."
1,A flat out hack job,"Why is this ""book"" so bad? Laurel E. Fay doesn't give a hoot about her brilliant subject. Ms. Fay only has an extreme political agenda(developed by her unbalanced mentor), and she makes her arguements very poorly. The life and times of DS are facinating, tragic, and heroic, but in the hands of Ms. Fay, his story becomes just plain dull. Worse, it's just plain wrong. Her factual inconsistincies are appalling, even spurious. Laurel E. Fay is the ""Kitty Kelly"" of academia. The great Dmitri Shostakovich deserves, and has justly received, better. Please, for the sake of all that is decent, do NOT buy this badly research, and badly written ""book""."
2,Some techniques/behaviors do not work as described.,"Comprehensive, but some of the techniques and behaviors (particularly on the CD) do not appear to have been adequately tested. For example, the centering layers behavior provided on the CD does not work -- at least not on a windows platform with IE 4.01."
4,Great book but the accompanying CD is flawed.,"The book is wonderful--very comprehensive. They did a rush job on the CD examples, though. Many of the image links are broken, etc.Jill"
1,Uhhh... why can't we just go to macromedia.com?,"Okay, it's another Dreamweaver book, but why? Why do we need another Dreamweaver book? Dreamweaver is self-explanatory; it's an easy tool to learn, and that's one of the great beauties of it. So why do we need yet another book trying to steal some of Dreamy's firepower? I found it rather useless, what's the need for it?Aa for the book itself, well... it was interesting, I guess. Fairly well-written, but the CD is RIDDLED with bugs! I can't believe they'd release such a flawed CD! Well, that's all, and for those of you out there, here are my words of wisdom:Check the Dreamweaver online help, for goodness sake!"
1,Poor quality ....Bogus Hanes?,The items I purchased were unwearable. My husband used the briefs in the first package and found the fabrice was much thinner than any Hanes briefs I had purchased before. There was also a problem with lack of elasticity where it was needed. He has not opened the other two packages and we will probably dispose of them. You can be sure I will never purchase clothing from this site again. Too bad.M. Fazio
5,"An intro to Run-D.M.C, an intro to rap, an intro to the 80s.","This is the best CD I have ever bought. It is essential to anyone who loves rap, likes it a little, or maybe has never listened to it.Im not old enough to remember when Run-DMC was at their prime, but put on this CD and take a trip back to when rapping was about the rhymes and beats, and not about rims, guns, jewlery, women and throwbacks. This is the prime of rap music.Run-DMC is the best ever. They completely put everyone else to shame, past, present or future. Get this CD. You will love it like I did."
5,Back in the day,"Run dmc, where to start, this album is fantastic, it is compiled of all there hits from the begining through to there second last release. All the songs on this are greatsome of my favourites are-walk this way-its like that-my adidas-its trickyI highly reccomend this to any one looking to learn a bit about the start of hip hop"
5,Run DMC - Greatest Hits,"Really good that an album like this came out. A bunch of Run DMC classics on one cd. Run DMC set a standard style for Hip-Hop and theyll be remembered for doing so.The production on this album is just crazy. That old school sound that sounds perfect on these songs. This album has 18 tracks, all classic RUN DMC songs. But back to the production, most of the beats are insanely dope. If you like old school hip-hop then youll love all these beats. Some beats that are standouts are.. ""Its Tricky"", ""Beats To The Rhyme"" (Love this beat), ""Peter Piper"", ""You Be Illin"", ""Its Like That"", ""Sucker MC's"", ""Jam Master Jay"" (RIP). These beats are top-notch and keep that real hiphop old school sound to it.The lyrics are also good, just your typical old school hip-hop. I recommend this album to any Run DMC fans of course, and anyone who appreciates real hip-hop and old school hip-hop.My Top 5 Songs1.Its Tricky2.Beats To Rhyme3.Peter Piper4.Sucker MC's5.Jam Master Jay (R.I.P)"
3,Run-D.M.C. - Greatest Hits,Item came in a timely manner. Only problem was that the CD case was smashed. May need to find a better way to package it because the US postal system wasn't to gentle with it.
5,Something for all us whiteboiz!,Yeha this is the real deal. I used to think there hadn't been a decent black musician since hendrix but you's gots to admit it these guys got reaal tallent. 50 cent and JaRule and all those sucky hiphop acts have no tallent and no musical skill and cant rap (JaRule once billed as the greatest living rapper... yeah right! crazey Jehovas Whitness) these guys are where its at and they got the real skillsU an ovber the ayyge of 3
5,Worth It!,Author Aaron Sanchez was at the South Beach Food and Wine festival last week and was FANTASTIC! He made recipes from the book and made traditional dishes like mole effortless. His personality and love of cooking and tradition clearly showed.
2,Have owned this cookbook for little over a year..,"Have owned this cookbook for little over a year..and have cooked nothing from it. nada. zilch. So... I am not basing my review on the quality of the recipes, but rather the appeal of them as a whole. I have many cookbooks, and in almost everyone one, their is usually at least one recipe that screams ""make me"" .. alas.. this one tends to be a shelf filler."
5,versatile,"Very good buy. You can be a pirate one year or a renaissance man the next (just add different accessories, e.g. boot covers, a hook, a wig) - a truly good deal."
2,"Too short, too small","I ordered this for my husband but when it arrived, it was about four inches too short for his 6'3"" frame in both the arms and legs. It was too tight across his chest and back even though I ordered the size that is suppossed to fit a 44 even though he normally wears a 42."
4,Chilton's Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth manual -- mighty handy!,"If you have an older car (like me), something inevitably fails or needs to be replaced. This manual has step-by-step instructions for repairs and service, showing in detail how to get to each part and do what needs to be done.It has procedures ranging from minimal to major. It's an invaluable tool to have around and a great addition to your other car repair tools. I used mine several times and keep it in the car for the next time it's needed."
3,Needs a little TLC,"My son is a huge Shrek fan so this dragon was a must have. My only problem with it is that the head is made so the mouth will open and close and the top of her head always falls off. I thought the first one I bought was defective so I took it back to the store and got a replacement but it was the same way. If you child is a big fan I would say purchase anyway my son has learned to treat ""dragon"" with extra care!"
3,So cheaply made!!!,"My son loves dragons, and shrek, and he likes this toy, but I have to put the wings and head back on this toy ALL DAY LONG. The fire breathing feature never worked for us anyway, so that is a complaint from me, but my son never even knew about the fire. This toy should be made out of one peice without so many lame features like wing flapping and fire breathing that don't really work well anyway, and make the toy cheap and breakable."
3,Wings won't stay on,"My daughter who is a huge Dragon fan gets so frustrated that Dragon's wings won't stay on. Other than that, the wings will flap and the mouth open to shoot fire, we however lost the fire before we had a chance to test it so I don't know how it works. The baby dragon/donkey is about the cutest thing ever though."
3,it's not thát good,"I saw this cd has an average rating of 5 stars, for me that's a bit much. It's certainly not thé best album ever. But it's quite good though, bought it on the blue and have no regrets, it's a good, raw punk album. Especially if you like the band this cd will be a good choice. If you're new to them, try 'Ghost Stories' first.Check them out live as well!"
1,Annoying,"I've always like Scoppettone's mysteries until this one. Lauren likes to present herself as someone who's computer savvy and yet when she starts getting vicious email from a certified psycho, she has no clue. She doesn't know how to find the domain the mail is coming from. She searches for a missing person by posting queries in unrelated newsgroups (very bad netiquette) instead of doing an online search. She's just become a pain. I don't expect everyone to be a computer expert -- but if you say you are, you better deliver the goods. And the return of the psycho just puts this book into the ""oh, no, not that plot device again!"" category. Boring and stupid."
2,Outdated...not very useful,"If this were a book based on Java 2, I would give it a higher rating. But this uses Java 1.0, and the code is broken up into many different pieces...far too confusing for me. Also, the book did not really give you any information the first couple of days."
1,A waste of money,"This book only gives suggestion on improving a game. It does not give you complete code of any class to give you an idea of what the code should look like. It also assumes that you know next to nothing about java, so it spends more time explaining java, then it does with game programming."
4,Good for class,"Good for my Journalism class. Covers all the basics and gives you a foundation for developing an understanding of journalism & the media. This is an outdated copy, but it uses great examples that relate to the chapter focus.I was supposed to purchase the 2009 version for my class, but this one works just fine. The main thing they changed were the examples."
5,Better Than Expected,"The bag art was what initially enticed me, but the actual size of the bag became my greatest concern soon after. I read claims that the bag could hold an obscene amount of things, and I must say, those reviews were correct. The bag is more than enough for any laptop and accessories, allowing for, as one review states, several days of clothing as well as toiletries. I'm keeping this bag until it wears out."
1,Ripped Bag All The Way Down The Side Just 2 Weeks Old,I do not recommend this bag as it is poorly made. It ripped down the sticking on the side all they way down one side just after owning it for 2 weeks. The graphic on front is cool and the bag is large but it matters little since it does not hold up to even minor wear and tear. Very disappoint. I am buying a totally different bag hopefully it will hold up better than this one did.
2,Design,When I used the handle on the top of the bag the linning ripped down the stitching. A few weeks later the rest of the seams started to fall apart do not get this bag if u carry something that weights about 10lbs.
3,"Good, for the cost.","The item was what you would expect for very cheap rubber scrapers (not spatulas!!!). They are not that flexible, but did perform quite well as a rudimentary piece of rubber stuck on a stick. Would not recommend those to the aspiring chef, but they are good for everyday, nothing exact needed, cooking."
2,Hmmmmm....,these are really cheap and one of them broke the first time i used it. I would say spend an extra buck or two and get something that will actually work and last you...
3,Don't like the silicone,I don't like how hard the silicone is on the spatulas. I like them more pliable but they will work.
2,Not the greatest quality,Did not know when ordering that these spatulas cannot be used with a heated pan or they will melt. The price was low so I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Just fine!,"These are the more flexible rubbery kind, which I prefer over the more firm plastic type. Just what I was looking for, thanks!"
2,junk,"You get what you pay for, but do not use these with anything hot or even something warm, they melt and they are not very pliable."
4,good,"These are essential in my kitchen. Very happy with them so far, they have held up in dishwasher about 5 times now. Was expecting black handles like the picture so they would match all my other black utensil handles, but they came with white handles instead. Would have rated 5 star if they would have come as pictured."
3,it's okay,"They are average spatulas, not as flexible as I thought they would be, so they would not scrap off everything as my last ones did."
1,Not flexible!!,I was unable to scrape bowls since these are like mini spatulas as far as their flexibility.....what a wasted purchase!!!
4,Can't go wrong for the price,"Wanted a inexpensive spatula to use when my better ones were in the dishwasher. For the price these are just fine. Do everything and work just like they should. I like them for getting batter out of a bowl, and the longer one works nicely to get food out of a jar.Of course they are not like the heat resistant but then they don't cost much either. Just be aware that they are basic spatulas and will be ruined if used in a pan etc.Would recommend to anyone who wants a spatula that is not fancy!Can not go wrong for the price!!!"
1,Poor quality,"I didn't need major quality, but the top of the spatula cracked right off within a week or so of using it. This was not a money saver."
1,Mission M35i 3-way Floorstanding Tower Speaker- PAIR,"I can't review the quality of these speaker sound or other characteristic.The ad state"" Mission M35i 3 ways Floorstanding Tower Speaker-Pair"".The Pair never came, just one speaker was sent to me,I return the Item.Very dissapointed with the process and alternative given to me."
5,One of the best offerings of perhaps the most enigmatic band or the rock genre...,Best collection of songs and solos from Tull. The mix is good and the live factor generates tremendous impact to their class and tightness.
4,Carriers,"A viral pandemic that sweeps across the United States, and four fleeing friends who discover that they are far more dangerous to one another than any airborne pathogen. The themes an end of the world plague that leaves four young survivors traveling the empty backroads of the US may not be exactly be new, but it's done with exceptional style that elevates this movie beyond standard issue horror. ""Carriers"" tells its story and builds strong suspense with fine pacing and some terrific ensemble acting. The filmmakers explore fear here in a compelling, genuinely human at times, even poetic manner. Good movie."
2,it's like plague-theme hallmark tv movie...,"If you like hallmark made-for-tv movies, then this is for you. If you hate hallmark with a run-like-a-zombie passion, avoid this. This is a film about the emotional aspect of having to outlived the dead by somekind of plague. VERY EMOTIONAL but not a tear jerker. Just average."
1,"Depressing, empty movie.","Don't recommend it. It will leave you depressed and wondering why you spent the two hours watching it. You can find a better movie, or something of more value to do with your time."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,"Carriers is a surreal look at the end of humanity through the eyes of 4 survivors of a deadly virus. Unlike many other similar stories, Carriers follows two brothers and shows just how far people would really have to go in order to survive something of this nature. Its raw and graphic and made me wonder if this is how the people who lived through the plague felt."
5,Carriers,"This is a low budget film, but it's good. The acting will blow you away, and you will forget how cheap it is. Just relax, popcorn up and enjoy."
2,The Trailer is More Exciting,"This is possibly one of the most dissapointing ""Zombie"" movies I've ever seen. Very rarely are any ""infected"" seen, and the characters make possibly the worse decision any logical human could make. The remake of Day of the Dead is so much better in so many ways.It's unfortunate since the trailer painted this as a original and compelling virus flick, but it ended up being flat and boring between the cliched writing, poor character decision, and lack of anything compelling visually."
1,POINTLESS AND DULL,"I usually like viral/apocalyptic movies, but I don't like writers who cop out by not explaining anything about their virus. What is it? When did it start? How far did it spread? I don't need to be spoonfed but I'm tired of writers who don't know themselves what's going on. And it's dull as dishwater. The four leads are not likeable even though their performances are pretty good considering the material. The best performance is from LAW AND ORDER SVU's Chris Meloni as the distraught father. Just a mess for me."
4,GOOD LITTLE THRLLIER DIDNT EXPECTED!!!,"Usually if a studio dumps a film into a handful of theaters with no press screenings, it means the movie is a dog. NOT SO with Carriers, a surprisingly good thriller about a handful of survivors driving across the desert after an unnamed pandemic has decimated the country. Chris Pine, Christopher Meloni, Piper Perabo and Emily VanCamp all give very strong performances in this film, that although positioned as a horror film is really more a character study of what people are willing to sacrifice in order to survive. This movie is not filled with cheap direct to video tricks - there's no gratuitous violence, profanity or sex. Instead the film is unflinchingly bleak, well shot, face paced and filled with several quite poignant moments."
4,Great quality but very heavy.,"I have a big lab. She responds well to these pinch type or gripping collars. This is a very good quality collar. My dog responds well to it. She is very aware that the collar is on her. Smaller pinch collars tend not to make an impression.I don't see the need for the weight added by the quick release as these colars should not be tight on the dog. It looks like it will last forever, but it is so heavy that it hangs below her neck, when I would prefer the clasp and leash ring to stay at the back of her neck. (the picture of the one I purchased was not accurate. It did not show the release clip. Perhaps it is a picture of an older version) I always just slip it over her head rather than mess with the release. I also feel that I need to take it off of her when I am not walking her because it seems too much for her to lug around. It is probably for the best, though as it is safer for the dog."
4,Presidential Folklore,"The Coachwhip Publications edition (ISBN 193058542X - just copy and paste that number into the Amazon search bar - the edition might not show up otherwise, in search results) is an inexpensive reprint of this charming collecting of folkstories told about and by President Abraham Lincoln. This could make a good first introduction for younger children to American history, giving a little insight into the personality and public persona of one of our most famous presidents. There is some minor bowdlerization in this edition."
3,"Good, but limited in scope","Good outline on building a fairly simple Fender styled guitars. No real discussion of calculating fret distances, neck angles, choosing pick-up position and the like."
4,Meets its mark.,"This book is intended as a starting point for the first-time guitar builder and it does its job well. Step by step processes to construct both a six string electric guitar and a four string bass guitar. Topics covered include wood selection, tools, electronic components and construction. There is even a small part on playing. While there is certainly many more avenues to take in the guitar building arena, this book will get you started by taking you through the entire process for two solid quality pieces. From there...you can certainly choose further research alternatives."
2,Nice pictures - but not enough to build,"I just purchased this book based on reviews read on Amazon. I would not at all reccomend this book. The book does have a nice layout and a lot of great pictures..... but thats it - a pretty book it is but the drawings and technical illistrations you need to build it are not included.... IMPORTANT things like neck thickness, neck thickness at the neck joint, any many other important things are not covered at all. A dimentioned neck end, and neck pocket detail are not even included. A body layout is shown and again not dimentioned. The only dimentions that are given are for a template to route the pickup and bridge holes... The most important topics are barely covered like setting the neck and bolting it on, alignment etc.....Nice - but I would not tell anyone to buy this book,"
5,Great Basics with Imagery and Quotes,"As a beginner to the world of Sacred Geometry, I am pleased to report that this book is great. It is a truly easy read loaded with imagery and quotes which support and embrace Schneider's views."
4,Mostly Excellent But Sometimes Silly,"I agree with prior reviews that the book is fun to read and, to the degree that it sticks with describing the wonderful, mysterious properties of numbers and the symbolic understanding of those properties, it's top notch. Occassionally, however, new age wishful thinking takes over. For example, as evidence of the cosmic significance of the number eight, it is noted that the sum of the angles in an octogon add up to 1080 degrees, the same value as the radius of the moon measured in miles. There are a number of other similar cases in the book when one feels that the author is really stretching in order to make a ""significant connection."" That said, the same enthusiasm that leads the author onto thin ice also makes the book a fun introduction to the romantic and mysterious aspects of mathematics."
5,Brillian engaging exposition,"Brilliantly engaging exposition of numbers in math, harmony, and the world. Lively, lucid, and incisive discussions start with numbers 1-10. One gains a rich appreciation of the patterns in the forms and movements of nature. I am left eagerly awaiting its sequel."
5,A method for meditational voyaging thru worlds around us!,"Forgiving and putting aside any semblences of ""New Age fantasies"", Michael Schneider offers extensive and enlightening research into the mathematical realities all around us. This book ranks in my top-favorite 4 or 5 library essential list. I only wish that I had this teaching method available to me while in junior high school; it would have made so many areas of study so much easier and interesting."
5,a noetic labor of love,"This wonderful book is utterly unique. It is a universe itself constructed, I am sure, along Schneider's imaginative recipe. A combination of precision and poetry, this book will clarify and shore up your thinking. A vast labor of love (a life-time interest) this book is filled with imaginative illustrations, and an endless wealth of margin quotes from the great inventors, scientists, poets, mystics, scriptures. I can dip into it anywhere, and get lost. Schneider has a good eye for metaphor and analogy, as well as an insightful grasp of etymology, and uses all of this to transfigure your ordinary thinking about numbers, shapes, words and objects all around you. If you love logic and analogy, and if you have always sensed some basic secrets about numbers that your 4th grade teacher never let on -- you have come to the right place. ""A Beginners Guide To Constructing the Universe"" is a sparkle of wit, smarts, reverence and presumption."
4,Shapes and Ideas,"This is a great book for parents and their kids.If you ever wanted to convey a sense of wonder to someone - how to explain shape, sound, philosophy, and art through mathematics you will find this book enjoyable.The conceptual projects are fun - like origami on steroids with a slightly higher IQ.It would be a five star book but for the fact that it lacks some citations, and a small minority of the information presented (i.e. ice being a mineral) is not unimpeachable fact.Still, worth the time and money to buy and try."
3,A matter of order,"I thought the book was excellant except for the order of the numbers, and it is a pet peeve of mine.0, or zero, comes before 1 and all of the other numbers. It has to. For in everything, you start off with nothing, or zero. Go to an American kindergarten and you will see 1234567890 somewhere on the wall. And they wonder why America has problems with math. NO other educational system in the world does this.Zero has to come first. It holds a position. Use another math base, other than decimal, and it the problem becomes obvious.In the binary number system,0000 of course is zero. 0010 is the equivalent of decimal 2. The other zeros hold a position, that is important. Your computer will not work with this positional system. Order is critical.That is my only problem with the book. This book has a tremendous insight. I just wish he had considered order first, instead of after."
3,"Eye-opening, yet flawed...","What I find fascinating about this book is the way it explores relationships between numbers, and why geometry is not as artificial and arbitrary as most people think today. For example, the REASON why bees construct honeycombs from hexagonal cells.The author knows his Pythagoras, but unfortunately he plays fast and loose with a few other things. One example is the ""red devil"" image of Set that doesn't exist anywhere in ancient Egyptian literature or art. And throughout the book he seems to go a little too far into New Age mystical fuzziness for my tastes.Overall I'd recommend the book, but any statements that aren't purely mathematical, take with a grain of salt. The math itself is fascinating enough without the embellishments."
4,unlike anything I've ever read before!,"Pythagorian mathematical philosophy intertwined with Hindu mysticism, unlike anything I've ever read before, about the numbers one through ten. Almost every page is filled with fascinating photos, diagrams, or other graphics but without careful source citation, only with copyright permissions on the last page of the book, making it challenging to track down the original sources as I hope to do. I recommend it if you don't mind enjoying the mathematical philosophy (where I read every word) with a healthy admixture of Hindu/Eastern mysticism (where I skim read)."
3,"Spiritualism, not science","The Beginner's Guide is loaded with many facts and pictures related to numbers. As a source book for the mystical and natural significant importance of numbers, the book is top-notch. As a book of math, the Beginner's Guide is a poor buy. There are no proofs and no formulas. Any given paragraph will likely have a spiritual context. If you are a numerologist, this book is a must-have. If you're a mathematician, this probably isn't the book for you."
2,A few gems--mostly blather,"Reminds me of people who see number patterns in everything--even when it's mere coincidence. A few good ideas and concepts, but trying to tease them out is a chore. And some of the books statements are flat wrong--sorry, but nature is sometimes horribly prolific with resources, not studiously careful. If you are interested in a kind of metaphysical approach, it might be very interesting, but if you are interested in real numbers, real math, real life, um, not here. He points things out that are derived from a triangle or rectangle or the intersection of this or that . . . but really, the 'things' could be designed with other concepts in mind."
1,Not impressed,"I was hoping for a relatively scientific treatment of the subject, not numerology. If you believe in horoscopes, you'll like this book."
4,A stellar transfer for a terrific movie,"Some things are frankly mystifying about this DVD release and the movie itself in terms of its high quality. In 1975, most film stock was pretty poor, especially for budget productions. Casino of Gold looks like an A-list production with great film quality, camera work, lighting, etc. and the DVD release is sharp as a tack. Someone somewhere really applied themselves to this transfer because I've seen Blu-ray releases of 70s films that don't look nearly as good as this. Worth every penny, you would be easily justified in thinking it's high-def if you saw it unawares.We all know Tamara Dobson owned this role, but Norman Fell is terrific and under-used as her theoretical boss.The DVD quality is so good I'm tempted to give 5 stars but ultimately this is a guilty pleasure, not high art. Strongly recommended though."
3,"Good, Enjoyable Bubblegum Nonsense Action Sequel","The sequel to ""Cleopatra Jones"" benefits from the authentic location of Hong Kong and its good production design. The story is almost the same as the original one, showing us Cleo fight against drug syndicate, of which mastermind, this time Stella Stevens, lives in a gorgeous casino.You might remember Warner Brothers once produced ""Enter the Dragon"" featuring Bruce Lee, which became a worldwide hit, and probably this fact influenced the studio's judgment to shoot the film in Hong Kong. The film is full of shoot-outs and kung-hu fights, but unfortunately, not as good as Lee's deadly fighting style, but still it is mildly entertaining. The final action sequence, chain of good stunts using motorcycles running in a casino, with its riders shooting machineguns (!), is the showdown of the film, and though the film nearly gets so close to ludicurousness, still remains enjoyable as a whole. And check out Stella Steven's outrageous costume."
4,How Could Cleo Afford Those Outfits On A Government Salary?,"The sequel to ""Cleopatra Jones"" outshines the original in virtually every respect. Better story. Better action. Stella Stevens' Dragon Lady is way cooler than Shelley Winters' cartoonish Mommy in the first film. Terrific use of the exotic locales of Hong Kong and Macao. An ending that would make Peckinpah proud. Plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor but not the outright campiness that scuttled ""Cleopatra Jones"". Tamara Dobson, who rose above the silliness in the original, relishes the opportunities that she's given here and goes with it. Now if they would only issue ""Norman...Is That You?"" with Dobson and Redd Foxx on DVD."
3,Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold,"Unusually, this movie does not tend to suffer from ""sequelitis"" and is every bit as good as the first one.Instead of the States, the scene of action is Hong Kong and Macau, and there's plenty more martial arts action from Cleopatra. The car chases are not bad, though not a patch on the first movie. Trivia note for Australian Ford fans: Australian-built Ford Falcons feature in the car chases; firstly a 1967 XR model, then a 1970 XW model.Cleo's nemesis this time is played by Stella Stevens, and Albert Popwell features again."
2,"Go, girl!","This is not much of a film, but I don't think it was ever intended to be. Low-budget and B-grade, this 70's action film is a riot, sort of a female Matt Helm movie without the martinis. Dobson has big fun, and that's what makes this fun to watch. You've got to be in the mood for camp, though. Don't expect much, and be ready to laugh. Oh, and Stella Stevens' outfits. Child."
2,Film,My husband wanted to collect a copy this film. The story and the acting are rather poor Film quality is good.
2,Cleopatra Jones and the Casino,"This old movie involved a black woman (Cleopatra Jones) and a Chinese kung-fu girl. They smell something wrong going onin the Casino. They work in a team to solve the puzzle.This film has a bad light/ camera effect. The fighting scenes are short and not bloody at all. The story line is good only forcoffee-break. Of course, it is no comparison to an old 007 James Bond movie."
2,"Interesting, only for historical value","This movie isn't anywhere near as good as the original. It isn't really a blaxploitaion movie at all. It seems more like they were experimenting, trying to see if a black female lead could carry a non-black movie on her own. It was a somewhat interesting movie, maybe for historical value, but not really entertaining at all. A typical ""kung fu"" movie of the era. The sad part was this character wasn't really the same one that I liked from the original movie. And I don't think Ms. Dobson showed her hair at all throughout the movie, she wore hats the whole time. I was so distracted trying to figure out what was wrong with her hair."
3,The original is still the best,"Like most sequals, this movie is not of the same caliber of the original Cleopatra Jones. It is, however, entertaining, and collectors of Urban 70's movies will find this one a ""must have"" for the collection."
3,3 of A Kind beats a Straight,"I chose this book because I thought it was a chronicle of stories. Stories of black gay and lesbians, not an analytical outlook on the community. Delroy Constantine-Simms mentions in the introduction that this book was supposed to be an ""anthology of Black perspective that was either sympathetic to or antagonistic toward the subject of homosexuality"". I wish it was, instead the reader gets several essays that read like textbook stuff.If you're looking to read thought provoking essays then this is the book to read. You won't, however find comments from those who have a hostile point of view regarding the homosexual community.Reviewed by Missy"
2,Fakes,All but two tracks are by studio musicians. The authentic tracks are Sugar Sugar and Leader of the Pack.
3,Greenhouse review,"The greenhouse is a pretty good value for the money; however, living in North Dakota as I do, I feel it is not really practical. Last night, May 15, it got down to 21 degrees, and even though I have a heater in the greenhouse, it was not able to prevent some frost damage to my plants. Also, as other reviews have stated, we had to secure the framework with rivets if we were to have any hopes of it withstanding our ND winds. Having done that, however, it has held up pretty well so far (we had wind gusts of 55 MPH the other day). Overall, I would recommend the greenhouse for those in warmer climates."
3,Weatherguard 63001,Weatherguard 63001 8-by-8-Foot GreenhouseThis will be my 3rd growing season with my Weatherguard greenhouse. I take it down in summer after the planting is done and put it back up in spring..reason being our windy conditions and rough winters. My only problem has been contacting the company for replacement parts..need new front door panel because zipper sticks. Other than that it has worked wonderfully. We anchor it with 4 dog tie outs and it stays very secure.
1,More White Bashing from an Educator!,"It's amazing how someone can get a Doctorate degree yet be so singularly focused, narrow minded and misinformed about White motivations and insight. Bill Cosby as a Doctorate too. Point taken."
1,Biblical Grandparenting,"This book could get me into serious trouble not only as a parent, but as a grandparent by encouraging me (as a grandparent) to go where no parent should go with adult children. The author feels it is appropriate to become involved in all aspects of ""parenting"" grandchildren. A very disappointing book that offers impractical advice in a preachy and condescending manner."
2,NOT AS ORDERED,"Item received was not a single compartment, as ordered!!. Air regulator causes problem with TASA in re air travel. dissatisfied even though normall more expensive, not as ordered."
4,Not like other Priest albums,"If you compare Sad Wings of Destiny to any other Priest album, or if your only familiar with their 80s stuff, you'll notice a BIG difference in the style the music is played. I want to say this album is like a heavier version of old RUSH songs, but that would be insulting because this is Judas Freakin Priest we're talking about here! The songs on Sad Wings are long, not very heavy, artistic, and more complex than their later albums. Its a tough one to call, but you have to give credit where it's due. Priest really did a nice job on this album."
5,Clear and Concise!,Anyone who trains NHL players has got to be listened to!My only complaint: the author needs to put out MORE material for us!!
1,Not suited to the average person,"Someone should tell Mr. Poliquin that the best way to train arms is to not train them! They get plenty of work through pulldowns, rows, and pressing movements. Keep the poundages moving gradually upwards in the big exercises and the arms will follow.Mr. Poliquin is knowledgeable when it comes to training elite athletes, but his methods would kill any normal individual. I highly recommend Stuart McRobert's excellent books if you are serious about gaining muscle in a non-professional capacity."
5,6 songs of perfect poetry,"Ive been in love with brighteyes for a long time now, but I had never heard of Neva Dinova. Well now in in love with them to. This cd is short but great. My favorite are the last two tracks. Do yourself a favor and pick this up!"
3,Only two songs sung by Conor Oberst,I would assume that most people buying this album are Bright Eyes fans. Only two of the songs are sung by Oberst. Spring Cleaning is written by him but the other guy sings it. Black Comedy and I'll Be Your Friend are the only two he sings and they can be downloaded on Itunes for 99 cents a piece.I repeat do not download Spring Cleaning if you wish to hear Oberst singing.
2,very disappointed,"If you buy this cd looking for bright eyes, dont do it. It doesnt have the feeling or flavor that is so appealing about bright eyes. the singing is an attempt to be clean and the instrumentation, if thats a word, is normal. Theres nothing special there to capture you. This CD may be decent in itself, but when i think of bright eyes i think of something much much better than this. Do not buy this cd, get something else by bright eyes, anything else."
1,Horrible DVD of excellent film,"I have this on a tape that is nearly unwatchable, but I stuck it out and found it rewarding viewing. I was excited to get this DVD, which I assumed even at a budget price and likely too heavily compressed, particularly given that the film runs an even two hours, would be an imporvement on that tape, but I was horribly mistaken. The sound is so distorted as to be nearly indecipherable, and an unlistenable film is even worse than a difficult to watch film. It's a shame someone hasn't seen the value of this film enough to give it a decent release."
1,Bum DVD,Of all the DVDs I've purchased through Amazon this was the only one that was unwatchable due to both poor video and sound that dropped out completely....Too bad since I'm a TLJ fan
5,Best Healthiest Snack,"Took waaaaay too long to arrive. I buy these from other sites, and they are great. Price is good here, if you can get them in a timely manner. The peanut bars taste best. Totally organic."
4,Great bars,These bars are really useful for when you don't have time for a full meal. They are a tad bit on the sweet side. Would get them again.
1,GET ANOTHER BRAND!!,"Truly YUCKY!! I am a health food junkie. I love greens, and I eat a lot of protein bars when I'm too rushed for real food. I don't like artificial stuff, so I thought these would be a perfect fit. They are horrid!!!! I can't even bear to eat a whole bar. I wasted $30 on the box, and imagine shipping it back would be too much work. Please save your money and try another brand. I am not a person that bothers writing reviews, but was shocked that this had so many good reviews when the product was so unpaletable!!! Are they written by the owner's friends and family??"
4,good if you're working with a teacher,"I bought this as a study text for my first class in reading the Qur'an. It is a translation authorized by Al-Azhar University which certainly is as good a recommendation as one could ask for. In addition to the line by line translations there are hundreds of notes that help a great deal in clarifying obscure points and possible misinterpretations. I found the title of the work a little misleading, though, since aside from a very brief historical introduction and the excellent notes, there really isn't a lot beyond the Arabic text and the translation. A teacher is essential, although that's not a knock against this book- it's very hard to imagine that the Qur'an could ever be 'do it yourself', no matter how much explanatory material an author might choose to add."
5,Wonderful Stuff,"I have used this linen/ironing spray for about 5 years now the ""Serene Dawn"" and LOVE IT... the scent is fresh and clean and it works so much better than spray starch. I hope you get more in. I am down to 1/4 of a bottle."
5,A Handbook for Inner Work,"Here are 157 pieces of literature, most on a single page. Each one is like a room in a monastery; not the one in the title story, which is the product of the illusions of the greedy, but a genuine, inner one. Some rooms have windows through which to see the world around us more clearly. Some rooms have mirrors in which to see ourselves more clearly. Both windows and mirrors are specialized to help us see subtle things that we would otherwise miss. Then we realize that the windows have become mirrors, and the mirrors, windows. A handbook for inner work."
5,A Marvelous Collection of Teaching Stories,"This book not only entertains, it educates as well. The tales and vignettes in it are called Teaching Stories because teaching is precisely what they do. They teach the reader how to escape from the confines and limitations of usual, normal thinking processes. They do so by showing the reader to himself or herself, reflected in the actions and motivations of the characters in the tales. The reader can learn how to operate more free of bias. The effect is similar to suddenly coming across riches, the riches buried within ourselves. Repeated readings reveal more layers and depths, each guiding the reader to greater understanding and freedom. 'The Magic Monastery' is, for these reasons, quite a catch."
4,Bama fie,"Man this Album is fie these boys r the new south Bama Gee is off the rip Landmark is fie I LOVE THAT 2 HOT HANDLE track #1,hunderd spokes #7, Rookie of the year and Hey LIL Mamma. i gave this album a chance and i like it."
4,Kept my attention,"The book is a page turner. I couldn't put it down, I had to try my best (along with Jennifer) to figure out why Mary Ann killed herself. Who was behind it? Who was the father of her baby?"
1,WHAT secrets? You'll have to look elsewhere....,If you are expecting to learn anything new about German secret weapons then forget this book.

4,Very good,"Complete treatment of the many german secret weapons.Not so deep description, but I believe complete, including canons, rockets,air and earth based projects. Outstanding illustration."
3,"Helpful book, but not worth what some are charging","This book is a great introduction to cryptic crosswords, and how to identify the types of wordplay that are utilized in the clue. Puzzles are given at the end of each explanation, and cumulative puzzles are incrementally scattered throughout that encompass all the wordplay learned thus far.What you need to know before purchasing this book is that it is a very skinny paperback, and certainly not worth the money that some sellers are asking for it through Amazon marketplace!"
5,Chichi Dit it Again! Mucho mas que Suficiente!,"WOW, what can I say about this album. I just got it hours ago and I haven't stop listening to it. Chichi's music takes u right into his world from the minute that you open the cd case. The art work explains his message, the vivid colors, the much thoughtout pictures and then the best lisenting to the cd. The masterpiece of this year. From La Zalamera to Mas Que Suficiente, and Te Pienso. Chichi is stronger than ever, delivering his message one of the best way ever done.The wait was worth it! this is without a doubt an award wining cd from one of the world's best musicians.""Por que Su amor es mucho mas que suficiente"""
4,Good legendary 60s gore flick!,"If you're an HG Lewis fan or just the low budget horror exploitation scene of yesteryear you'll wanna see this '67 effort.People who expect a slickly done horror feature should stay away,unless you harbor an admiration for camp.Anyway,since I belong to the second group mentioned I'm all over this!A cool movie,but not quite up there with Blood Feast but what is?This dvd is great quality,has the trailer,a short,and a revealing commentary track.Worth a look."
4,This is a truly Wacky film....Right Napoleon?,"This is the final ""gore classic"" made by Herschell Gordon Lewis the ""Godfather of Gore"" it concerns a lovely old woman named Mrs. Pringle who runs a wig shop that sells ""Real"" human hair...Mrs. Pringle also has a sign in front of her house reading ""Room For Rent"". Little do the unsuspecting college students who rent the room realize that there is no room...the only thing that lies in store for them behind Mrs. Pringle's door is her mentally deficient son Rodney who promptly turns the girls into wigs in the most gory manners possible (typical HGL style). This is probably the campiest of HGL's ""gore"" films in which the heroine is a Nancy Drew want-to-be and there is a lot of empty space...a scene in a drive-in and a racing track that have NOTHING to do with the plot and of course the classic opening scene...a 20 minute conversation between 2 manequin heads but all-in-all it is a great film."
2,Minimal Humor. Phony Gore. Bad Acting. A Classic?,"Though this movie claims to be unique for its controversial gore and outrageous humor, it wasn't too graphic and it wasn't too funny. Certainly if you are a person who abhors blood and gore, then this film or any other movie by HG Lewis would be a bad selection.I can only recommend this to people interested in horror/exploitation and filmmaking. Because its director was considered revolutionary, it would be a good plan to view this if you are interested in film. Yet, I learned more about what not to do with cinematography. Yes this was an older film, but other early horror classics managed to utilize the camera properly.All in all, it wasn't a complete waste of 72 minutes. It made me laugh....but only at the bad acting and flat characters."
2,MORE FROM THE GODFATHER OF GORE,"This movie is so cheap and bad that it's funny. It's about a little old lady who runs a wig store that does booming business as the hair is so ""realistic"": that's because she lures college girls to her home, only to throw them into her basement for her retarded son to scalp with his electric carving knife. The acting is seventh rate, the budget lower than your average porn movie (this makes DEEP THROAT look like TITANIC budget wise) but this is good for a laugh and in terms of gore, this is probably the EXTERMINATOR of it's generation. The scalping scenes are disgusting . . . and funny. This movie is better than BLOOD FEAST anyway."
5,Disney SingAlong vids are priceless,"Song list for this video includes:""Be Our Guest""""Spoonful of Sugar""""Little Wooden Head""""Bella Notte""""Heffalumps & Woozles""""Beauty & the Beast""""WOrld's Greatest Criminal Mind""""Chim Chim Cheree""""Once Upon A Dream"""
4,Excellent translations - fun too!,"Disney has the best translators in the world, and these singable translations are proof. However, as a previous reviewer pointed out, not all of the songs are from Beauty and the Beast. In fact, only two of the songs are (""Nuestra Huésped"" and ""Fábula Ancestral""). Others on the tape include: ""Eres Tú"" from Snow White, ""Chim Chimnea"" and ""Un Poco de Azucar"" from Mary Poppins, ""Elefantes y Wumpas"" from Winnie the Pooh, ""El delicuente más cruel"" from that movie with the title character Ratigan (I forget the name), and ""Una noche bella"" from Lady and the Tramp. I use it in my high school 1st and 2nd year Spanish classes and the kids love it."
4,Pretty good book,"This is a pretty good book if you really go into reading it . It talks about how Jessica and Salvador trying to tell Elizabeth what kind of person Richard is . But they kind of failed as Elizabeth doesn't wants to listen to them , thinking that Salvador's jealous and all . All in all this is a pretty good book I must say."
4,Pretty good...but read all the others ones first!,This book is ok. I am too surprised at how much Salvador and Jessica got along. I didn't like how jealous Salvador was! I'm glad Elizabeth knows there are more boys than Sal! Richard ...I liked him at first but then I didn't really after he would flirt with many girls! If you are going to read this book..I'd read all of the earlier books in the SVJH series! They are all good!
4,Very good book!,"Hands Off! is a really good book but not as interesting as others, though. Okay, it is about Elizabeth who thinks Richard is really sweet and nice when she falls in love with him when they start hanging out and finally asks her to be his girlfriend. When Salvador passes through his locker, he hears that Richard was just using Elizabeth as many other girls he used to date. Will he get to prove it to Elizabeth?"
5,Elizabeth + Richard=?,"This book is great. It's not AS good if your into Damon and Jessica, but still good. Elizabeth should have listened to Jessica and Salvador. Eelizabeth started going with Richard, and Salvador and Jessica tried to tell her not to 'cause he's a player. Elizabeth just thinks Salvador is jealous. She's shocked at Jessica and thinks that Jessica can't be glad for her."
4,Richard&Elizabeth,"Alright so Liz finally gets a boyfriend who is just as good looking as in other guy in SVHJ! But when Sal finds out about Richards dating problems, He's only being a good friend and trying to warn Liz. Instead him and Jessica are the ones getting along more then him and Liz! I would tell ya more but I'm afraid I might say to much!"
2,Nice fan but construction flaw,"If the design were not so badly flawed I would rate this a 4 or 5 star product. For its size it moves a good amount of air and provides welcome circulation. However- I definitely had the problem other reviewers mentioned- the magnet assembly on one of the two I bought had already separated when the package was opened, and it broke free on the second one on only the second use. I hope a good helping of superglue will fix the problem, otherwise there is no way to mount these and they will be all but useless. I'll report back once I try the superglue idea.Update- superglue seems to be working just fine. Amazing that Coleman has not fixed such a simple flaw.Update 2- after just a few uses, the fan blade keeps falling off. On the verge of demoting to 1 star. Not at all worth the price."
4,Used to Ciculate air in a Ice House,"I bought this for the purposes of circulating all of the warm air that rises to the top of my portable ice house. The ice house is 6wx5dx6.5h. It does a descent job at pushing the air. I haven't used it in a tent yet (weather at night in minnesota is pretty comfortable for sleeping most nights), but it would be good for a small two person tent."
1,Fragile Blades,"I have one of these fans. It worked great until the blades broke off. I got about 4 or 5 camping trips with it. Next time I took it out of the camping chest the blades were broken. Not much good now & don't know how to get more blades. I would suggest instead of this item to find a tent fan with a good cage around the blades to protect them. No chain is stonger than its weakest link, and these flimsy unprotected blades are its weakest link. I would think Coleman could do better than this."
2,"Not a ""fan"" of this fan",Me and my friends bought a couple of these to try and keep our tents cool out at coachella music festival. Fans don't blow that hard and were completely ineffective.
3,Works great,Works great in tents for dogs that suffer from gas problems but it eats up batteries like a hog!
1,Useless,I might be very unlucky or these are really poorly made. I ordered two fans and both came to me with the magnet detached. The magnets were only connected to the fan with a glue of some sort and even without the D batteries they were pretty heavy.
3,it's okay....,in a 6 person tent you will need 2 of these and u can't hang it from the top or it'll be too far. works fine if it's right in front of your face.
4,Great for family camping,"Great for family camping where you can afford the weight from carrying batteries. The output from this fan is adequate for one person, so if you have kids plan on one for each of them. The down side to that is these units do have enough weight that they can present issues when you use more than one per wall.Overall a good product."
2,Happy Camper/Hiker,"This is a rather adequate small, portable fan that will put out some air circulation. It is rather lite-weight, until you put in the monster sized D cell batteries. The weight gain is considerable. The battery power does not last long either, approximately three (3) hours if you are lucky when using this in non-stop mode. Have to agree with one of the other reviewers that when you insert the batteries the fan does tend to bulge out and then you have to wrestle with it trying to put the cap back on. I, too, broke the tabs on mine but that was fixed with duct tape. If attaching this item to your tent ceiling using the provided magnet, it will make the ceiling sag quite a bit, especially after inserting the batteries. Recommend using this item in a tent where you have some head room and not worry about banging your head on it. The fan blade is made of plastic, so, theoretically, you should not have to worry about getting cut. Overall, an alrite item."
2,Meh.,"This product is small and not very powerful. I have used it numerous times and eventually went out and bought two battery operated standalone fans...this didn't do the trick for us and didn't circulate enough air. I also really don't like the magnet mechanism that holds this in place - especially when using with a mesh area, it really pulls and could damage your tent.I would not buy this item again. Lesson learned."
1,Wish I listen to others,Cool Concept but it broke the first camping trip.I sent the receipt to Coleman requesting a replacement and never heard anything back from them so I pitched it. I will think closely before purchasing a Coleman product again based on their customer satisfaction on this product.
1,Great! WHEN it works.,"I bought this fan for a week of camping in the Ozarks. I was absolutely thrilled to see the unit ran all night for the first two nights on a single battery. As a precaution I changed the battery on the third night. The unit was not working in the morning. Assuming it was a bad battery I changed it. It slowly began to run and just stopped. I was unable to get the unit to run any longer than a couple of minutes at a time, and then only by spinning the blades to get it started. I gave up after the fourth night and eight batteries later. We disassembled the unit and bypassed the switch. Still nothing. By squeezing the motor, we got it running well. Clearly the motor wasn't up to the task as the brushes were most likely gone. This was unfortunate as the unit provided a decent flow of air, and was quiet enough to sleep with. However, the tiny motor is not good quality. Also, it costs just enough to be frustrating, but not enough to go through the frustration of returning."
3,"Nice - But Expect a Breeze, Not a Windstorm","I bought the Coleman Tent Fan for a recent camping trip. The fan runs on a single D-cell battery, and is pretty simple; one on/off switch, and a flexible rubber fan blade. The magnetic mounting plate is a nice and simple solution; the plate goes on the outside of the tent wherever you choose to locate it, and the fan goes on the inside, with the magnets holding it securely in place. You have to literally twist the metal plate to remove the fan from its position, so it won't easily fall at random.The fan output isn't as much as I had hoped for. In a 3-person tent the Coleman Tent Fan will provide a nice breeze. It's strong enough to circulate the air in and around your tent, but not strong enough to say, blow your hair back in the wind. My only other complaint is that the price is a little high for a molded plastic fan. It's useful, but if you want a fan that will cool you down in hotter temperatures, try something larger than this."
1,doesn't really do anything,"don't recommend this product. it is a very low speed fan, and doesn't really hang well anywhere it would work in a tent. I have a Copper Canyon 1610 -- so its a very large and durable tent."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Used it once in a small tent, really close to my face and it helped but thats the only time it worked because it stopped working shortly after...yes I changed the battery and it still would only turn on for a couple seconds then shut off once I layed down."
4,backpacking tent fan,i got this fan for tent camping in cold weather. i use it with my Coleman catalytic tent heater which runs on a propane cylinder. the fan is needed at the top of the tent blowing down at the heater to keep all the warm air from rising to the top of the tent. it is the smallest most compact and light weight fan i could find. it is important for a backpacker to have something light weight that will pack small. this fits the bill perfectly. the back of the fan is a removable magnet that you put on the outside of the tent and the fan is put on the inside so that the magnet is holding onto tent fabric and it works great. the only negative i have is the battery compartment is a little tricky to open. you have to jam something like a car key into one of the two holes that say push. i almost broke it until i figured out what i was doing. other than that its a nice little fan.
4,Works as Intended,"I like this fan very much. Ya, the blades are not protected, but you have to be careful when transporting and storing. Works very well at moving air when it is positioned directly over you either in tent or trailer. I will buy another one when this one breaks."
4,Good fan!,"It feels slow speed, but it's much better than nothing.What I saw, is what I got. Nice buy!"
3,keeps you cool,"I have used this tent fan several times in my two person tent and it does keep you cool when you point the fan on your face. It doesn't have a lot of power, but that is ok, it did it's job. It has a great magnet that attaches to the tents, no problem with it falling off.Two minor complaints. One, it is kinda heavy for the size, and Two, the plastic lip that you press to open to get at the batteries tends to crack after you open it a few times.With all that said though, it does work. I would get something larger for a large tent (4 person +)."
3,Over all good replacement,"Delivery was alot quicker than i anticipated as I live in Hawaii. It only took 7 days standard. As for the install, I have a 93 YJ and the front two bolts line up perfectly, i had to drill through the metal support and use lag bolts for the rear 2 because they were about 3 inches short of the original holes. Mounting in the vehicle was easy. just slid right in."
1,Missleading info - connector not directly compatible with Blackberry pearl,The connector on this charger is a rounded ... and not the mini-USB you would expect to get and that would allow to directly plug-into a Blackberry Pearl phone.
5,The quintessential spiritual guide.,"Absolutely the best spiritual guide I have ever come across. Read slowly, it is jam-packed with common sense!"
2,Dinky,"Disappointing product. Based on the pictures, I thought this tree would be small but mighty. Instead, it's just small and dinky. The lights don't all work. Do not recommend."
3,"Not Bedford's strongest work, still good","A Rose by the Door by Deborah Bradford is a sweet piece of Christian fiction. I wasn't as moved by this book as I have been by Bedford's other works, specifically If I Had You. Bea Bartling tends her pioneer roses in Ash Hollow, Nebraska and looks into the face of everyone who comes to see them searching for the son who ran away. When tragedy strikes, and he is killed she turns her back on her faith. The secret that is the core of this story seems a bit overwraught. Because the rest of the story is pinned on it, once it is revealed, the rest of the book kind of falls apart. The characters never quite came to life for me, and the end ties up a bit too neatly. Honestly, a sequel to this book would probably be stronger than the original. I really do love Bradford and her other books, this is just a weak anomaly."
4,Romeo and Juliet(Royal Ballet) Rudolph Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn,Film quality is not the best. There are several blank interruptions.But my wife is still thrilled to have it all the same.
3,I love...,"I love Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, but staging is particularly ugly and colors very bad. A poor representation very confuse"
3,Sound Quality,"The dancing was as expected wonderful, but, unfortunately the sound quality was not. I tried playing it over my amp,no way, so normal sound was called for, also very shakey, not what I had hoped for !!"
2,Not a high quality transcription,"I found the transcription to be pretty low quality. There are pops in the audio and snow in the video. There is another version on Amazon which is almost double the cost ... maybe I should have chosen that one.Of course, the music and the dancing are marvelous, but what did I expect.I did appreciate written scene synopses and bios of Prokofiev and the dancers."
1,total crap!!!!!!,this charger is total crap and a waste of my money. it did not charge my 3.6v 1800mah PSP battery even if i left the crap Plugged up over night. this charger had no instructions letting me know how id know if the battery was charged or not. and the fact that the seller was very miss leading when they stated that it would charge a psp1000 battery well your wrong seller it doesn't when the output for the charger is too high and has probly killed my battery thus forcing me to buy a new battery and charger. so people if you have the 1800ma battery dont buy this charger it will kill your battery and wont even try to charge it.
1,killed my offical psp battery,this charge just killed two offical psp batteries I plugged them in then thought it would be done so plugged in another now bolth batteries are toast will not charge with anything. there was nothing wrong before I had just used one of them.now i read the packaging and think this may be european only definatly was in chinese had to look up weird word that makes no sense:elucidation i think they meant electrocution
1,Worst product,"I received this item from somewhere called ShenZhen, China. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to receive, and it came with no instructions. I foolishly purchased three chargers as I have four different phat batteries. The chargers failed in charging a single battery of mine after I had left them charging for about 16-18 hours. This is the worst product I've ever received through amazon, and I think amazon should screen their vendors a bit better."
1,Bad Product,"I bought this product to recharge my psp 110 and s110 batteries (phat and slim).well first of all, no where in the description states this can ONLY charge the 110 (phat) battery.so you'll assume my s110 (slim) battery wont charge, will only after i put it in to realize that MY S100 DO NOT WORK ANYMORE.THIS PRODUCT FRIED MY S100 (SLIM) BATTERY.I TOTALLY HATE IT.and btw, it takes forever to charge my 110 (phat) battery.totally hate this product.go buy the original sony battery charger.pay more, but at least it works."
4,Classic Video,"I loved the movie Stingray - saw it years ago and tried to find it again. I did not like the title of the package deal - ""Heat"" - as it looks like a [...] title - but, when you get to the movie, you will be happy if you are a fan - even though the video quality is not so hot."
2,too bad the drive-ins are gone,"It's too bad this movie will never make the drive-ins again, but hold onto your hats!Grab your popcorn and generic beer trailor park fans, this will make your saturday night better than a drunken fist fight! Although Sherry Jackson, William Watson,and Burt Hinchman do some decent acting, the rest of the cast apparently was pulled from a local tavern. The script was obviously written on the fly, and everyone always has on the same outfit----no wardrobe. Although there a few humorous moments and some decent chase scenes, this film obviously was a flop before it hit the cutting room floor. A real knee slapper for late night red-neck tv, but not worth renting for any other reason."
1,"May be beautiful, but too bothersome by far.","Yes, the vests are great. They might even be simple enough to complete in two hours... but that's after you take the book to a copy place and pay for blueprint-sized copies. In addition, the author has included only S-M-L sizing. I would guess that if you're going to require the reader to enlarge patterns 285%, you might be able to eek out an XL in there for those of us who are a bit more well-endowed. The vests presented are beautiful and the pictures/artwork are worth a look. If you are interested in ideas, seek this one out at the library: don't invest until after you've previewed it for yourself."
3,How to cut the costs of enlargements,"This book contains a wealth of info and ideas. However, I did find it a bit difficult to find a copy center that could do the 285% enlargement. The enlargement cost $10.00 but a second one cost less than $3.00. I traced the basic vest onto an 8 1/2""X11"" piece of bond paper using a good technical pen so that my line weight was consistent. I then traced pockets and anything else that would fit. By having two prints made I had one for myself and one for a gift (given with the book). Now that I know what size to go for I will use a projector to scale up tracings for the other vests. If you don't have your own projector it is possible to use one from a library.There are four vests with variations."
1,"Lovely vests, lots of good ideas, but not worth the effort.","I purchased this book because of the lovely designs and what appeared to be well thought out instructions and was greatly put off by the lack of patterns I could readily use. By this I mean patterns I can copy to scale or order--and since I can't measure the patterns themselves I don't know if they'll fit anyway. I visited several copy centers today and learned that having these patterns reproduced at 285% is not as simple as the author makes it seem. While I may wind up keeping the book for ideas, I'm irritated enough that I may return it on principle. Too bad, Ms. Hiney would have had a really good thing if she'd gone the extra mile."
5,"Dervish ""rocks""!","Awesome CD! What talent. The first three songs are SO excellent, and flow together really nicely (gives me chills at some points). Seamus does a great job with Ewan MacColl's ""The Lag's Song."" ""Soldier Laddie"" is another highlight, and Dylan's ""Boots of Spanish Leather;"" etc. This is a fun band to see live as well."
2,Too thick,"Far too thick of an oil...feels ""gunky"" and ruins the lathering/application for the cream above it. And it isn't as lubricating as Zirh, Art of Shaving, Anthony Logistics, etc. during the actual shave either. No point in buying this when better options are available at comparable prices"
2,they sent the wrong thing,"The wrp said that it was a pre shave, but the bottle said that it was an aftershave. The recipient was not happy."
5,Great Supplement!,"This book is a great addition to any CoC collection. Not only does it provide tons of information on the people, politics, and customs of the Bermuda triangle and surrounding areas, but it is loaded with useful creatures, ideas, theories, etc. It has many charts that all keepers should find useful, such as one that randomnly chooses a sea animal. And, to top it all off, it comes with a scenario that I cant wait to throw on my investigators. It is well worth the cost, and then some!"
1,Definitely not Krentz's best work,"If it weren't for the Renaissance story thread, I'd have tossed the book without finishing it (Jonas is a dishwasher with a PhD in history). In the beginning Verity lets Jonas force his way into her closed restaurant and gives him a job even though she is fearful and suspicious of him.Jonas later shows up at a nearby spa where the owners let Verity use the hot tub after hours. Jonas joins her in the women-only facility, climbs in with her in his underwear, and starts fondling her. I've never run into another of Krentz's female characters that stupid. It does get better toward the end.The sequel, Gift of Fire, is much better. The only reason I read it is that I bought the two books at the same time."
4,Even after 10 years I remember this plot vividly!!!,"This was the first book of Ms. Krentz that I read, and that was all it took; she had me hooked! Even after 10 years and hundreds of books, I remember the plot with great detail. Gifts of Gold, and its sequel, Gifts of Fire make a great read for those who like contemporary AND historical fiction. There is a dash of the paranormal, which Ms. Krentz later expands in her 'flower' books (Orchid, Zinnia), but which she wrote about WAY before it was vogue to do so. I just love the way she took our hero and heroine and combined their special 'gifts'. With a quick wit, a great sense of humor, a villanous 'bad guy', and some great sensual scenes, this book is not to be missed!!!"
2,Disappointed,"While I love Krentz's books, I would not buy another in this series. It doesn't seem to measure up to her other trilogies with hollow characters and plot."
3,Not one of her best,I like science fiction but this book was to hard to believe. It was also a little slow paced for my taste.I like science fiction but this one was little hard to believe. It was also a little slow paced for my taste.
3,Not up to the standard set by her other books,I'm about 1/2 way through the book and I keep loosing interest. I keep reading and reading waiting for the story to move forward and it's not there. I've put in down twice and read other books.
3,Not what I expected,"There are things the book should have included but were not there such as what cards should be passed. He mentioned a very few that were good, but he should have given much more examples as to what cards to pass and not to."
3,Big Disappointment,"Not for one looking for principles. Mostly a collection of wild-titled hands, impossible to remember. Chapter Nine, ""The Grand Squash,"" is devoted to a hand the author has seen only 3 times in 20 years. Go figure."
3,Is there another book ?,"Supposedly teaches by showing many examples and situations where you could have done so and so .. I didn't find any real rules to follow and very few tactics that can be inferred from the examples. I'm an above average Hearts player and certainly have to say that I did not pick up anything to improve my game in this book. The best hearts book? Probably so, but only because there isn't another out there.Dry and painfully boring."
2,Poorly Played,"From the amateurish color registration of the cover to the numerous editorial errors and vague rambling advice, this is nothing more than a thin piece of cheese. Someone is simply out to impress his friends with all the new 'hearts' jargon buzzing around some of the Zone rooms. Save your money and your time."
2,Not All That Good,"At first I thought this was an okay collection of cartoons. However, after I looked at the individual shorts, I am not so sure. None of the shorts have the title sequence. The menu does not have the titles of any of the shorts. I think this is a big deficiency as you never really know what you are watching unless you have some background in Felix the Cat cartoons. This is too bad as the films themselves look better than usually for an inexpensive collection. It could have been better."
3,"Great music, sound quality mediocre","The music on this CD is great. I can recall how thrilled I was as a big I&S; fan when I first played it on my recently self-built Heathkit stereo system back in my super-poor grad school days.Unfortunately, this is a very muddy CD print of that great vinyl LP. I hope it will get a better CD release some day."
4,6.5 Hp Overhead Valve Engine 3/4 Inch Shaft,"Decent engine, Honda GX200 Clone so parts are interchangeable, used it for go kart and it works fine, although shaft wasn't correct size, few mm over 3/4 had to shave it down. Been running it for 2 weeks no problems 1 year warranty not bad."
1,Don't bother with this filter,"Unfortunately this filter did not work properly for us. It was pretty noisy when it did run. Later when it was quiet I just assumed that it was still running, just more efficiently. I guess it wasn't running at all. Perhaps 2 turtles were too much for it because I was constantly rinsing the sponges which were always dirty. I took it back to the store where they recommended ReptoFilter by Tetra. I wish we would've bought this one from the beginning. The Zoo Med couldn't keep up with all of the shed skin but I've only seen a few floating pieces in the water since we've had this new one."
2,Not the right brakes,I ordered these brake pads under the assumption that they fit my vehicle. The info i put in on the website said that these pads would fit my 02 Tacoma. Unfortunately when the mechanic tried to put them in he said that they were not the right fit for the truck. My mechanic also looked up the part# on the Akebono website and found the same brake pads were listed. Had to return these and buy a different brand.
3,Expected better,"Anne Audain was an amazing runner, and in a time when female athletics was fairly ""new"". I enjoyed learning more about her, but the book is rather tedius. I've read other books by John Parker and expected it to be written with a little more excitement, but have not actually made it through the entire book yet. As a coach, I keep hoping to get a glimpse of her training and what helped her to become so great, but that isn't really there either."
3,great story,"The story is not just about Anne Audain, but the politics of running and the history of the sport going professional. A good read. However, my rating reflects the number of typos and grammatical errors throughout - distracting. John Parker had the same issues in his books, so maybe not surprising."
5,This CD is awesome,"Great CD there is a great live version of ""Drain you."" Any Nirvana fan will love this CD."
1,Great Single to own,"This maxi-single is a great buy. The CD is long out of print and contains the song that was supposed to end up on American versions of Nevermind but was accidently left off which is called Endless Nameless. The live tracks from October 30, 1991 and the title track are also great. I recommend getting this single if you want Endless Nameless. I also recommend picking up In Utero,Muddy Banks of Wishkah, Nevermind Nirvanas most underrated album Blech and MTVs Unplugged album all worth getting if you dont have them stop wasting your time reading this review get out there and purchase these classics."
3,B List,"Some acts don't travel well, even though they represent considerable rootage in their own context. New Zealand's The Parachute Band has produced such an act in the live worship album YOU ALONE.No doubt the venue(s) and event(s) at which this music was recorded were a great thing. But on a CD, far from the tree whence the apple falls, it comes across as a B List production.That's a shame, because the movement of which The Parachute Band is a part is a formidable and not infrequently beautiful thing. 'Just goes to show the soft underbelly of the 'live worship album' phenomenon."
5,Nice,I really like this poster. We also have the what is life one. I have yet to display the poster since we have not purchased a frame for it. They are rather expensive for the poster size.
3,This product seems to give more energy while ...,This product seems to give more energy while exercising. I have read that it helps while dieting but with more time I'll be able to efficiently test this product. It helped me to exercise a little longer than usual. I'd recommend it!

4,I Love Paris in the Springtime,wonderful collection of witty sentimental essays on Paris. It was a welcome gift.Paul E.
1,Ripped off,"I ordered this item (2:00 AM Tues. 1/19/10)intending to wear it to a Viking game party on Sun 1/23. I paid $39 for ""expedited shipping.""Long story short, I WOULD HAVE received it in plenty of time on Fri 1/22; but the shipping label was incomplete, so FedEx held it.I CANCELLED THE ORDER ON 1/22/10 (11/30 PM) when it was not shipped on time.The company emailed, saying my address was incomplete, and I should contact them ASAP or they would return it to their warehouse. Well, they lied. They contacted FedEx with my full address on 1/25, and it was delivered 1/26. I took it back to FedEX marked not accepted.I GAVE MY COMPLETE ADDRESS (and it's there, big as day, on the acknowledgement of my order 1/19) - THEY FAILED TO PRINT OUT THE SHIPPING LABEL CORRECTLY.SEVEN DAYS FOR $39.00 ""EXPEDITED SHIPPING"" IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.I EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED FOR MY $49.89 EXPENSE. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE."
5,fascinating indeed,"For anyone interested in the full life of Michelangelo this is a must read. The editor is quite helpful without being overbearing in his attempt to put the material into a context. There is a short but very nice biography at the beginning which helps the reader understand the flow of the artist's life. The selection of his personal letters helps us see Michelangelo as a person, a person with substantial family and business difficulties which constantly tried to divert his attention. His poetry is delightful and revealing. A valuable text for anyone interested in his life, art, or era."
1,1 star still is too much :(,"listen to the samples: it's finest dada-music, karl-heinz stockhausen couldn't have done it any better :( maybe it's a new way for elevator-noise to rise from the schrotthaufens of like-to-be-kraftwerkersu like 2 vomit? buy a ""mouse on mars""-cd! better: give your money to any non-profit-fund or by something that sounds nice..."
5,"Very wierd, but very cool","If you like chirpy, squeeky, squelchy, burbly, elecronic pyrotechnics in your techno, check it out. Guaranteed to blow your mind with sounds and grooves you haven't heard this side of a freaky acid trip."
5,Fantastic read!,"This book is compelling and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is a page turner! You won't want to put it down! Plus, it is based on a true story. A story no mother would want to go through. It is definately worth reading!!"
3,Very short overview of his articles,"This is not a bad book, and it does have some good training material, but it contains very little information...hardly thorough enough to warrant [the price]. In fact, it's basically a 10-page document stretched out to 50 pages by using a large font and huge margins..."
5,Excellence,This book only leaves me wanting the upcoming volumes. I almost wish Coach Poliquin would retire and just write more books!
1,Mumbo Jumbo,"This book is a sad attempt to cash in on the notion that weightlifting is a complex science. Any book on weighlifting that contains graphs, mathematical formulae, and a ""law of"" for nearly every section is just a waste of time. This book is a complete waste of money and time. Shame on the author for pushing this drivel. To him I say ""shut up and lift""."
5,Auto repair,We needed this manual for home repair of vehicles. Excellent manual with lots of details. It has saved us money on repairs
3,Good for specs.,Works good for general repairs. But wiring diagrams are hard to read and understand. The book was on time. Description was right on. Worth having if you don't have anything else.
4,great,"Great hunting knife, shorter than I thought it would be but has a good feel and easy to keep sharp."
5,Great book,"This memoir of Jan Wong's college days in China is captivating. During a time of great changes in China, she was an adventurous risk-taker who did what she had to do. I read this book years ago and recommend it regularly -- iit's one of my favorites"
4,Easy to read - opened my eyes,"I did not follow what has happened in China in the news, including Tiannamen Square. I was moved by Jan Wong's description of her adopted homeland and what she expected when she arrived and how things had changed, and she had changed before her final departure. It was an eye opener for me."
2,Informative but unprofessional,"There's certainly an interesting story here, but it's bogged down by the author's clumsy, insensitive and pathetic attempts at humor. Although her personal story is integral, many of her anecdotes seem poorly woven in or completely irrelevant. It's worth reading for the information and unique perspective, but also a relief to be finished with because this journalist's style is much more grating than gritty."
5,Harrowing description of the Tiananmen massacre,"I read this book on a plane and when I got to the chapters on Tiananmen I was surprised to find myself crying quietly. With her western upbringing and Chinese ancestry, Jan Wong offers a unique perspective on the Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen. As a Chinese national who grew up in Singapore and Hong Kong, I appreciated another look at the self-inflicted human suffering and turmoil my country has experienced over the past few decades. We are our own worst enemy. Let's hope we learned something from all of this."
5,Beautiful memoire!,"This is a beautiful book to read. It's well written and you can hardly put it down. Jan Wong let's us be witnesses of her life choices and their consecuences. It's interesting how and why she decides to go and live in communist China, how she strugles to get adjusted to that kind of political system and way of life. She then turns into a great journalist and let's us see some unknown aspects of modern China. It's a good book to learn more about China's history. I enjoyed it a lot!"
5,Wow!,Having been recommended this book by a lady in an American cafe I bought it and was quite gobsmacked at the content. It's one of those rare books which captivates you through the interest in what happens next. Jan Wong seems to have been caught up the zest for Communism and its idealistic approach to life but over the years experiences just exctly what it really many to the many millions who endured it involuntarily. Having just finished this book last night I feel far more enlighted about what really went on during the early Chinese communist days and more recently during the tragedy of Tiannenman Square. My hat goes off to Jan for this work and I'd happily recommend it to anyone else in the cafe too!
2,I can't recommend it.,"Jan Wong has had interesting experiences, but unfortunately, her awkward writing makes her book a tedious read. She's also full of herself."
5,"First Class Singing, production,","All i can say, is the group was at the top of the game. The ladies sang some serious high notes on 'Very Special' with Mr. white production this is what you call first class Production and Singing. I think i read some place that Marice White had them singing as high as he could get them to sing on this project. I can not find anything wrong on this CD, evan the songs under a minute are prefect. I was not old enough to get to see them in concert during the time this CD/ Album was out, but would have love to see them along with Minnie riperton. My favorite are the following.FlowersVery Specialno plans for tomorrowWhat a perfect project! Classic!"
3,Heads Up!,"Purchased this through Crazy Saver / Amazon and it arrived in a plain brown box with two attachments, no internal packing materials, and NO paperwork! I assume that means NO warranty. It looks like it is probably a refurbished item though it was never indicated as such in the description... but then neither was 'New In Box'. The unit works OK but I am concerned about my purchase. Obviously it is a repack. I guess this is what you get for $19.99 instead of $49.99 so can't complain too much. Just think you all should know that a good deal might not be all it's cracked up to be. My issue has more to do with trust and the complete truth about an advertised item marketed on Amazon."
1,Hated it!,"I owned a remington supersonic and bought this dryer to replace it. I hate this dryer. It takes much longer to dry and makes my hair frizzy. Would probably be okay if you had fine hair, but it is not for someone with thick wavy hair."
2,"It just quit on me, mid drying!","I searched and searched for a product that would blow hard and hot enough to tame my naturally curly hair and this one did... until this morning when it started making a weird noise and then smelled funny. I turned it off, turned it back on and it doesnt sound like the same dryer AT ALL. Now, I am on the internet, about to buy the CHI (which I almost did originally) one for $125 and wasted the initial $50 I spent on this... thankfully its so cheap now so I dont feel so bad for anyone who actually buys it. I would say its worth about $15... NOT the $50 I paid for it at ULTA! Oh, and the fancy silver started coming off the side of the dryer within a few weeks and the rubber has been pealing alos, so it has looked awful for months!"
2,"So slow, it will take you hours to dry your hair!",The good: it is light and quiet.The bad: it is not very powerful and takes forever to dry your hair. So it will leave it frizzy and dull.
4,Great product & I'm delighted to find a source,"This is a wonderful solution to the grow-out area between coloring appointments. It hides the gray on the hairline and the part. If I go too long between colorings, it is less effective because it is designed to cover about 1/4"" of growth, not a whole inch!! I found it worked best applied with little short strokes in direction of the hairs and then worked in with my fingers. This would work for blond hair dyed dark as well. It also comes in black, lighter shades of brown, and auburn. I was delighted to find this source because the only local source I had went out of business two years ago."
4,"great product, and easy to use","I don't have any complains. It's fast, easy to use, and covers the grey.The color is a little dull, but pros outweights cons."
3,Okay in a pinch,"This is a good product to have between dyeing when you are going out and don't want to be embarrassed by your grey roots. It is more like lipstick than a dye and , like lipstick it remains pretty moist, so do not apply too thick as it will be too much, just a light touch is all you need.Mine took a long time to arrive, but it does what it says it will do and a good price."
3,cover gray lipstick for hair,"Really doesn't do what it says, mascara is the best bet I think. However do try to get it to cover my hair but seldom"
3,OK but too greasy,"This item does the job intended-- the gray coverage is good, hence you get get by postponing dying your hair another week or so. However, the product makes your hair really greasy, even with the smallest applications. Next time, I'll choose something drier."
2,Risk of bad performance,"Not exactly sure what the problem is, but right out of the box this line gave me issues. i cant fire rapidly or else it depressurizes itself and the bolt stays forward. It is also makes the speed of the ball inconsistent, meaning when i chrono it jumps from 320 fps the first shot to 295, then 265, then 315, and so on in a random unpredictable pattern. i use a tippman 98 custom.Not saying you shouldnt get it since other peoples seem to work, but mine had a lot of issues."
3,remote lime,it works fine but there was no instruction manual so i lost all the air in my tank the first time i used it. as long as you unscrew it fast you will be fine
1,Maybe I got a lemon,Leaked right from the start from around the valve on/off or the 1/8 fitting so back it goes. Looked well made and stout though !
3,Bedded by Blackmail Bundle,"I usually like strong characters when reading romance novel as I read those for pleasure. I expect to be entertained. When product are bundled together, there is usually one or two that do not meet the cut, in my opinion. That was the case here.I like the savings of bundling but because the title of each book is printed as you move from one book to the next I am always having to go back to remember the title I am reading. I hope Amazon can put each book title at the top of the book when bundling them together to facilitate remembering the book title. This would great help. Thank you."
3,"not as good as California Fire & Life, but not bad","This is obviously a younger book than California Fire and Life, but Winslow does have a knack for taking an intriguing situation and pulling it all together somehow. He seems to have lots of good ideas - a love story, a drama, a larger-than-life hero, a loser, a military thriller. Maybe next time he won't try to cram all five of these into one novel. The Life and Death of Bobby Z is pretty good but probably could have been fleshed out 100 pages or so. Seems as if Winslow is in a rush to get to the next scene. The book is 250 pages. Thomas Hardy would've written the story as 2,500 pages (his characters take 12 pages to go from the porch to the mailbox, but you sure know every tree in the yard by the time they get there, as well as the genus and species of every animal in sight), but I'd settle for a nicely done 500-page Winslow novel. I think he's going to be very good as his writing matures."
3,great adventure book,"this novel was just a little bit too much action and unbelievable feats of bravery and coincidence. it was nice and easy reading, a lot of violence and mayhem. but didn't compare to his books ''winter of frankie..."" or ''dogs...''. if you have a cold winter day and need an action book this would be for you.w nealt"
2,big disappointment,"I am a big fan of Winslow and have read most of his novels at this stage. However, I found this book to be very disappointing. It read more like a piece of self indulgence on the part of the author and it does not do justice to him or to his other work. It could serve as a put-off for anyone reading Winslow for the first time."
2,"I rate it low as a literary work, but I enjoyed reading it!",I thought this book would make a better movie.
3,Fun Read but easily Forgettable,"This novel has some fantastic action sequences but little else. It's a good beach book - a quick, light read, but not ""literary"" by any stretch of the imagination. The book is not what I would call a ""keeper"" either. Try to borrow this book from a friend or the public library. Even at this price, it's not worth what you get."
5,Great Story,"Winslow captures perfectly the ""loser"" persona of one character & the resilience of the human psyche as he evolves into the man he always admired from afar. Excellent insight, very well done."
4,a lot of fun,"it is a pity that the autor is not enough punctual. for exampel an m-16 gun does not shuts 7.62 mm bullet, it shuts 5.56mm bullet. eventhough it was a great book."
4,"Interesting look at art, artists and the landscape","This is a well written look at 8 artists in Nevada. Most interesting is how these artists and their work reflects and interacts with the desert landscape in a variety of ways.The artists respond in a variety of ways using abstraction, collage, installation and mixed media. The book is well illustrated and shows examples of the artists' work. Fox has an obvious affection for the artists in this book and strikes a tone that is balanced and enthusiastic. It is an interesting look at 8 specific artists but also delves into the creative process, culture in the Western US and how the landscape impacts all of that. Definitely worth the time!"
1,Save your money!!!!!!,"Folks save you hard earned money for some thing else. This heater is useless unless you put your hands directly over the heater face at 3-4"" away. Will not heat a small tent."
1,don't buy this .....waste of money,"this model will not start without the match . also there is no flame , so is very risky indoor specially with kids .STAY AWAY FROM THIS .you are better off with mr. heat portable heater ."
2,Disapointed,"I purchased this heater for a boy scout trip in New Hampshire in late March with my son. In a small 3 man tent with the temp around 20 it was still cold. My tent has a mesh roof with the rain fly on it so i assume the heat goes right out the top. I recently purchased a fan to hang over it to see if that will help,will let you know...."
1,Coleman Propane Heater,The heater was broken in several places on arrival and we sent it back. Could have been broken during shipping. Could not wait for another to arrive so we went to a local store and purchased a different Coleman heater which is working very well to keep the chill down in our tent.
4,Coleman Sportcat Heater,"Small heater puts out alot of heat. I have been using it for several months to knock the chill off in my hunting stand (a shooting house). Lights quickly and and is very silent. Initially had a new burning scent until the factory oils from manufacturing burned off, but is now very clean burning."
5,90% pleased,"I received this on time. Actually before it was due so 5 stars there.It works as expected. 5 stars for that but I was disappointed that it didn't feature a starter button; forcing me to light it with a gas candle lighter. Not any big deal except I have to have one of those or matches or a lighter of some sort handy.The smell; I guess this is part of the experience but oh boy oh boy-one 16 oz can = 16 + hours of what one other customer aptly described as ""the rubber belt of a vacuum burning up."" TIMES about 100. If you can- burn a can outside first. I couldn't. Other than that (ugh) it burns clean. You can't even see the flame in daylight and from one 16 oz can you get about 16 hours. For $5.00 for two cans of propane (Wally World) thats 32 hours of emergency heat.Nobody ever mentioned this but this thing makes an ideal emergency heater to protect plants in Winter. (as long as your plants can't smell--)Thanks for listening."
2,Not much heat,"Not much heat, no indoor use. Outside barely even heats up the lower legs at all when camping. Can take a little bite out of the cold air in a tent, but causes lots of condensation."
2,Not much good outdoors,This little heater lit the first time both times I used it. The problem is we were under a burn ban and needed this to keep us warm. It simply doesn't put out enough heat to use outdoors. You should've seen 3 grown men all hudddled around this thing to stay warm! This is more like a big hand warmer except we couldn't feel it beyond 2 feet away and it was only 40 degrees. Coleman says you can heat your tent with this but I learned early in my camping career that you don't light things like this in a tent.
4,Works great but not a lot of heat,Durable and very easy to use but doesn't put out as much heat as I thought it would. I use it in my tent for ice fishing and there isn't much of a difference in temp compared to outside but it is nice for keeping my hands warm.
4,Heat for Ice fishing,"Good heater for the outdoors,lights easy and good heat for shanty/ice houseBurn a tank outside FIRST because the smell of anti-rust lube is not nice"
1,Skip this heater - Coleman SportCat,We purchased this heater for our coleman 8 person tent on a trip that the temperature was going to drop into the middle 30's. This heater did not work for us. We could only feel warmth when we placed our hands over the heater. A friend recommended another heater so we returned this one and will be purchasing a Mr. Buddy.
3,Not very warm,"I bought this for my one man ice shanty and found that it didn't give off much heat. Its a very small one man and gets far too hot using standard heaters so was hoping this one would do the trick. On warmer days where I'm just looking for a little extra I may use it, but otherwise I'll probably try to sell this."
4,coleman Catalytic Heater Sportcat,The sportcat heater works well and is economical to run. It heats our camper well in the Australian snow country.The only complaint is the acrid smell given off in the first few hours of operation. After that it works just fine.Richard
4,makes your tent warm,"This is a heater you can use in a tent or a vehicle. It will warm your tent or vehicle. It does as it is advertised, and heats a tent or other small area. It heated my truck. I didn't freeze to death. I like it."
3,Don't expect this to throw too much heat unless in small contained area,"This will be a great product for me to use to warm up my 3 person tent before going to sleep (turning it off prior to sleeping of course), but it wasn't all that helpful for tailgating. I didn't expect it to produce that much heat, but even holding my hands pretty close to it I didn't feel too much heat. If I had purchased it exclusively for tailgating I would have been disappointed, but knew that I'd use it to warm up my tent and am confident it will be ideal for that situation given my tent is not a large one. If you're considering it for either tailgating or for use in a larger tent then consider the next size up like I now kind of wished I had..."
4,Camping Necessity,"When it's cold, you will be glad you have this. The whole concept of how it works is pretty neat to me, but the fact is, it really puts off some heat. The more expensive one is about twice the size though. I might have to recommend the extra few bucks."
2,Not worth the money,This product does not provide sufficient heat to warm up a tent for four. Don't waste your money on this product and buy a Mr. Buddy Heater. Is more expensive but will defenitely warm you up.
2,"OK, not great","We purchased the heater while camping at high altitude in a pop-top camper when the temperature started reaching near-freezing a night. It is compact, easy to light and small enough to fit into small tents and/or spaces. But it was not adequate for the space in the Coleman camper.It did take the edge off the cold, perhaps warming the interior 5 degrees or so, but never made the camper warm. We still required warm clothing and even a blanket around our knees/laps if we wanted to be able to sit up and read or talk.It would probably work better for a small tent, but it simply does not put out much heat. You can warm your hands over it, if you are careful.Next time I would purchase something with a higher BTU output."
1,Caught on fire,"First time it took forever to light. Got it lit and let it burn off a can of propane. After that, tried lighting again. Took forever. Next thing I knew, the whole heater was on fire. Burnt a hole in tent floor and tarp below it and tent door from where we had to kick it out of the tent."
1,Out Dated,"I did not realize upon orderign this item that it was dated from 1978 and the information contained within while not completely unusaeble was far from being much if any help. There are far better books out there on Vermiculture than this pamphlet.Also, be aware there are only 12 pages in this pamphlet."
4,The vestibular field has changed,"This is a great overview of where we are with vestibular evaluation and treatment. I am an ""older"" audiologist who is working on my Au.D. and this book has really brought to life the advances in the field since the last time I studied this type of material 25 years ago. To my surprise there have been many, many changes to this area and the role of the audiologist is now much more than just a technician."
2,"when they say ""bitter"" they REALLY mean it","I like a middle of the road marmalade, not overwhelmingly sweet, but also not too bitter. This product, in a 20g serving, has 10g of sugars and to me it doesn't taste like it's even remotely sweet. If you really like a bitter marmalade you'll probably like this, but it's not to my taste."
3,Not as good as hoped.,I love marmalade and constantly am searching to find an exceptional product. This was not it. The bitterness was there but the product was just too dense as if it had too much pectin. I blended it with a domestic marmalade and together they were satisfactory. The search continues.
1,Amateur work all around,"This DVD is O.G. Rider's first in the series and it shows. Video quality is poor. Camera work is poor. The audio is poor. There are almost no bikini girls in this video so if that's what you're looking for (Like I was), this video is not for you. This DVD drags on for almost 2 hours with shot after shot of hot low rides. The show is hosted by Martha Sanchez, who is a little too overweight to be the ""star"" of the show. The last part of the video includes two overly-thick girls dancing in thongs in front of a '64 impala. My advice is to look at later volumes in this series. They get better as they go."
3,Not a Dell Upgrade--just a power supply,"I chose this ""Dell upgrade"" model to avoid having to hack up my Dell case. Although my Dell is on their list of compatible model numbers this power supply did not fit. The power outlet on the PSU did not clear my case and the power supply case did not fit the internal frame. I had to use a Dremel and hack away at the computer case to make it fit. If you need a power supply, buy the one you want and don't get tricked into buying this one, because you'll probably be Dremelling either way. I'll survive the inconvenience, but OCZ should take better care of their karma."
5,Perfect Dell replacement power supply,Replaced a dead underpowered Dell power supply with this jewel. It's quiet and everything fit perfectly (both SATA and IDE) in my Dimension E310 mini-tower.
1,"NOT the 470W, it is the 410W","Amazon lists this OCZ product as the 470W, 470 watt power supply.It is actually the 410 watt power supply. Amazon has apologized and said they would correct the entry on the web."
4,Great PSU Upgrade,"I wanted to upgrade the video card in my Dell Optiplex GX620 but of course the stock PSU couldn't handle any of the modern video cards. Standard PSUs don't fit in the older Dell machines either, so I was very happy to find that OCZ makes these custom PSUs for Dell machines. I had a little trouble replacing the PSU since the original one had a tab that fits into a slot on the case (which the OCZ PSU didn't have), but with the rest of the mounting brackets, I was able to adequately secure the PSU into the case. Everything is working great and my new video card/PSU combination is letting me play all the latest games."
3,"Great PSU, BUT !",Yes the power supply is great but the wiring harness is upside down.I installed it in my Dell Dimension 5150 with ease however when I went to connect the wiring I found that the harness was backwards. Since each hard drive (2) is keyed it made for a sloppy install. The wiring doesn't lay flat.I did contact Power and Cooling but I received NO RESPONSE!Also the box it shipped in said 470 ATX Silencer. That wasn't what I ordered! I ordered the 470D and I sent it back only to have them return the same supply even though I talked to them on the phone as well.It turned out that the 470 ATX was really a 470D in the wrong box according to the bar code.I didn't want to smoke my mother board so this was a real problem.My computer was down for almost three weeks due to this problem.
4,Wheres Tutter?!?,"Back when my son first started watching Bear In The Big Blue House I had searched for a figurine set. I didn't find one but I'm so glad I looked for one again!The Pros are that these are durable toys, great size for small hands and my son loves them.The Cons ... My son loves this but sadly, when he opened it he couldn't find one of his favorite characters - Tutter. He was also confused by the two Bears and thought one was Ursula, the female bear friend of Bears.This is a good gift set for little fans, as long as Tutter isn't their favorite character."
5,My favorite,"If I have one catalog for art and/or archaeology exhibitons (and this fits both categories)I must have 75+ ranging from Troy and Borabadur through Velazquez to the Impressionists to St. Gaudens and to today's landscape artists.This is my favorite of all of them for the images, history, articles and sheer amazement of human creative genius.I bought one and gave it to a local art center and bought another for me. I'm sure when I die, you will be able to buy it from my heirs cheaply here, but it will not be in ""good"" or even ""acceptable"" condition, it will be too used."
1,Retread Material,"Not very enlightning; tired old leadership topics stringed together (active listening, dress-for-success, goals setting, morals, situational leadership, etc). I was hoping for more but it did not deliver. The CD's summary is: have goals, dress and play nice."
4,Indian pioneers in Africa,"This is the first book I have read that focuses on the development of East Africa as viewed through the eyes of the Indian community. Although Indians have been in Africa for well over 150 years, no one has bothered to consider their contibution to the development of Africa. All the existing literature focuses on the European pioneers and developers without so much as giving any credit to the Indian community. Full credit to Pally for having the courage and commitment to write a book that puts the emphasis on the Indian community and their contribution. An excellent book that gives an in-depth view of how Indians set out into the African wilderness and how they survived the harsh conditions and isolation."
3,a good first attempt,"This was a good first attempt. I would suggest a tighter editing for example, not concentrating on minute details such as everyone's height or weight. The story was very interesting, but I would have loved more detail on the political situation of the time and a lot more detail on the court case.I look foreward to the next book."
5,A great African experience,"I enjoyed your book immensely. I especially liked that your grandfather kept Journals. How else could we learn about our ancestors. We are so closely together as a people when we can pass on our experiences and knowledge to others.I liked Akash's letters as he wrote them. How wonderful his eloquence to Anar. Political unrest has been with us as long as I can remember. Do you think, as your grandfather did, that we will still see peace in our lifetime ? It is hard to comprehend the struggle for land between nations. I think your grandfather knew all things are gods. I too love people and I hope my prayers for a united world will surface before my demise.Thanks you again for your book. It was very hard to put down when I had to. I hope there is another book in you and that it will continue to enlighten us to your Africa, India or England as you know it and live it.Betty Boyce-Anderson, Laramie, Wyoming"
5,Very Readable,I found KIJABE very readable. I would have happily written about it in my newspaper columns if it had been available in India. You can inform Pally of my positive reactions.
4,Great choice,"I am pretty loyal to the body butters from ""The Body Shop"" but I thought I'd give this a try. Great smell, it leaves your skin soft and you get a good amount for the price. I only wish the smell of the shea souffle was longer lasting on its own. I know they say you have to layer to get the scent to last, but I think the scent should last a few hours on its own. Overall its a great choice."
5,Great Product!!!!!!!,"I was actually in the process of giving up the search on finding Carol's Daughter ""Almond Cookie Cleansing Gel"" until my sister told me to try Amazon.com. In the past I made movie purchases only and I assumed that other products wouldn't be found here, I don't know why I assumed that but I did. Much to my delight I entered this product and it was here and I was extremely happy because I couldn't find it anywhere else. It's always ""sold out"" whenever I try to purchase it at other websites. I'm glad I found it available at Amazon. This product is amazing to write the least and I LOVE it! A best buy for sure and it smells gloriously delicious I can't go a week without this scent. What's more is that it has a calming effect and feels very smooth to the touch. It's long lasting and you won't stop touching your skin once you apply it. I highly recommend it!!!!! Also, it makes a great holiday gift."
4,Rob Hodge needs to be in the studio recording his follow up album..,"I gots to say this cd is excellent, the cd starts off slow but around number 6, conflict, the beats pickup and you get to hear the lyrical flow. I love the songs tearz,most hated , thank you and hurricane. The majority of Christian Rappers don't get into much crunkness so I really like to listen to the worship songs that allow you to think and focus on God. I skip the skits and just get to the music. I think any listener to lyricist will like it. It brings rap back to the words not just the instrumentals, but I must say he does have some good beats."
3,To many songs and not enough Jesus,"I think that the Collins brothers water down a lot of there artist. In today's society when everything is anti Christ we as Christians should be praying and seeking God on how to bring the word, and spread the good news of the gospel withot religious judgement or compromise. The CD had a couple of good songs but I was expecting more spiritual content but instead I got a carbon copy of the world."
4,PRETTY GOOD!,"my cousin bought a rob hodge cd because hes only allowed to listen to christian music. i myself listen to Eminem, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice. at first like always i gave this guy a try i barely botherd listining to him. the song he recomended was '' im rich '' it was a pretty sweet song so i borowed the album from him and i like the following songs. im rich, most hated, hurricane*, and revoloution those are my favortes. theres some good songs on this cd. to tell ya the truth he reminds me a bit like NAS. theres 27 tracks. the only thing i didnt like about it was there were too much skits and songs that were like 40 seconds long. but overall hes not that bad of an MC i wouldnt compare him to like Eminem and G Unit and Shady records MC s but for christian music its PRETTY GOOD!"
1,GARBAGE !!! HOT TRASH !!! LEAVE IT ON THE CURB !!!!,"IT IS SAD WHEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T MAKE GOOD MUSIC, FLIP IT AND SAY ONE OR TWO WORDS ABOUT GOD AND CALL IT CHRISTIAN. THIS IS TRASH. IF YOU WANT TRUE CHRISTIAN RAP LOOK AT DA T.R.U.T.H. THE MAIN THING I REGRET ABOUT BORN KING IS THAT I HAD TO GIVE IT AT LEAST ONE STAR."
3,Good Resource,Good for what I needed for my research paper. Would recommend book for research but not as a general read.
3,Not like I remember,"I got these as a gift for Christmas cause I had them in my wish list, I was disappointed in them, they had lots of lobster which cant be bad in anything, but were dry as in mayonaise wise. Everything was fresh when it arrived, but just not as I remember as in my days of living in New England and having this sandwich at Points East in Westfield Mass!! Just my opinion, you just might like them, but Id add more mayo and maybe celery..just missing something!!"
5,Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We just loved these. We did not use the rolls provided as I like organic whole grainbread....but there was more than enough for 6 people. We ate it all ourselves though intwo days! It was too yummy to share! Highly recommend.
3,Meh.,"This newest version keeps the nice format of the previous edition,BUT for some reason students don't follow it as easily. Some basic elements like using italics for book titles are hidden. The examples are sometimes hard to follow and end up creating more questions than it answers. The example for block quoting does not efficiently show the one-inch indent.Meh."
2,ehhh...,"not one I would say is at the top of my list but one i would never watch again. the acting is cheeze, the direction is good but the ability to watch the story line is hard to too."
2,decent,not much in the way of a story but it's entertaining. would be surprised if blanks ever worked again...
4,it was great!,"I've seen this movie and it definitely is a great movie. But if anything its for someone who's into Martial Arts or is into the spiritual philosophy of the Martial Arts. This movie definitely spreads that essence throughout the film. The training sequence was awesome, one of the greatest sequences of any MA movie. So as for the acting and all of that, it portrays more of a real life learning process of life and Martial Arts. So i'd also recommend it if your looking to get a positive ,spiritual vibe from a movie"
5,i like this movie,"i really liked this movie. I have always liked billy blanks and i love watching martial art movies. Great choreography, nice plot and good philosophy, this movie is # 1 in my book."
1,the dump special...,"I was pinching a loaf the other day and it was hard coming out, but then I looked back in the bowl, smiled, and saw something that was more entertaining, intelligent and had less phenomenally rotten fumes emitting from it than that wretched piece of celluloid called Balance of Power."
1,So Basically...,People who don't like historically accurate alt-hist fiction such as Turtledove writes love this perniscious piece of trash?
3,The British can't take a joke.,Not as good of an overall read as Conroy's 1901. Still Grant's campaign in Canada was worth a read. Also nice to see Winfield Scott treated decently.
3,A good read for an airplane ride,"I've enjoyed all of Robert Conroy's alternative history novels. They're very imaginative, full of historical fact slightly tweaked to make things very different. One gets the feeling that author Conroy is enjoying himself (I'd like to see 1968 get the Conroy treatment, starting with the Tet Offensive and Walter Cronkite reporting it to be the crushing enemy defeat that it was.)The exposition in 1862 is somewhat slow and some of it seems well beside the point. Still, if you like alternative fiction stories of the Civil War, this is a good one. The denouement, when an English envoy hears the American terms for peace from General Scott, is priceless in its audacity.Conroy's other titles,1901,1942: A Noveland1945: A Novelare also recommended. They're all okay: my order of preference is 1942, 1901, 1945 and 1862."
2,Not well thought out.,"This book assumes that all of the breaks go to the union, that the Federals have pre-cognition of every right and wrong decision made in the original civil war. I also feel that it very seriously underestimates the advantages of the British Empire, and the fact that the Brits were the technological world leaders in 1862. Yes it would probably take the brits 12 to 24 months to ramp up, but the author needs to take a look at what was accomplished in the last year of the Crimean War. As for US Privateers devastating British trade, this leaves out the fact that the british built far better steam machinery than we did in the 1860s and Built better warships, guns and armor. Examine what the British were building in the way of guns, armor, and ships by 1865 compared to what the Union was building. This without the influence of a shooting war. There is also the fact that there is a real chance that France might also come in against the Union."
2,Disappointing,"Having read 1901 I was expecting more of this book. Basically his premise is England joins the war on the Confederate side and suddenly the Union makes all the right moves. Little to no research, shoddy writing and told from only one point of view. Throw in the authors version of a romance novel in the middle and you've got 1862. Good starting point for an alternate history but downhill from there."
2,Predictable ...,"I'm an avid reader of alternate history, so I'll read anything in that genre. This is not a bad book, but not great either. The plot is better and more realistic than Harrison's ""Stars & Stripes"" series, but no where matches Turtledove. It's somewhat predictable. The author could have left out his attempt at steamy sex-scenes. I've read ""1901"" and probably will read ""1945."""
1,Absolute trash,"What can i say , this is the only book that I absolutely regret wasting any time on at all....So many trashy & poorly executed plot lines in one place , no research and as complete (as someone else called it) a Yankfest ....how can you be interested in a proposition that shows one side winning so easily ( and against the biggest powers in the world at that time )...did they also have time to tidy up before lunch ?I am angry with myself for actually finishing it when it was obvious early on that it was a crap piece ."
2,You Got To Be Kidding!,"I Didn't think the book was that bad, but just the thought of Grant using superior tactics to defeat Lee is silly."
3,"Good idea, bad book","Great plot, great idea, but it was very disappointing. SPOILER: most of the main characters die and some, like Hannibal Watson, are not represented that much in the book. Like I said, it was a great idea, and I wish Conroy would have done better."
3,"Good paper, bad shipping","The paper was good quality, but it was shipped in a too large box with only a little packing so the paper packages were broken and corners bent. We only ordered 2 reams - perhaps a full box would have survived the shipping better."
2,Not what I expected.,"I didn't think it was as good as it was said to be. I looked at the reviews and a lot of people gave it 4 to 5 stars. I was disappointed with the film. Not as bad as some I've seen, but it just didn't meet my expectations."
3,Sleeper,"Yep this has the right title The Sleeper and a sleeper it is. I hung in there to finish the movie. It was probably a good little movie for back in the day but with all the technology and special effects of today, it doesn't stand up. Watch it when you are not tired because it is a good dose of sleeping medicine. Put this in and you will not need any over the counter sleeping meds."
2,HAMMER TIME,"This production has all the look, feel and quality of an 80's slasher film. It takes place during those obscure years tucked in between disco and Big Hair bands. America was still recovering from the shock of having elected an actor as President, an actor I would say was far better than any that appeared in this roughly edited film.The movie uses the ""killer's point of view"" technique which means they jerk the camera around during some of the scenes, but they don't use the technique effectively. There was no character build-up and while we saw the killer, they didn't drop clues as to why he was knocking off the girls.? What was that line dance thing? And did we have to see the whole thing? Sex and shower scenes with no nudity and they dare to compare it to an 80's slasher film. It falls short of an 80's style slasher. Roger Corman laughs in your face.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Riana Ballo)"
4,"Solid, But Could Have Been Better","The Sleeper is a solid homage to 80's slasher movies, that follows the formula down to the letter. That is both a positive thing, and a negative thing. It's postitive because The Sleeper is a refreshing change of pace after all of the torture porn and ghost movies we've been getting lately. But it's a negative, because The Sleeper doesn't have an original bone in its body. However, there is a good amount of gore and suspense, and I was entertained most of the time. The Sleeper gets a B, but I was hoping for an A."
4,The Sleeper,"Some horror movies promise an 80's feel but doesn't deliver but this one delivers. It has a creepy score, sound effects, & a few tense moments. The Sleeper is basically Black Christmas, the original, with a few gory kills. The first kill had me worried because it was done so poorly. The Sleeper (his nickname) hits a girl in the face & it caves in, the second kill didn't make much sense either. Aside from the decent gore, the killer did a good job. His face was never hidden & he looked like one of hundred of maniac's you'd see in an 80's horror flick. A reviewer pointed out some other slasher films he looks like he was from. While I agree those aren't the best slashers, this guy does a better job. Highly recommend this if you're a fan of 80's slashers, this looks like it came out in 1982."
3,the SLEEPER MADE ME SLEEPY.,"EH, WAS ALRIGHT.could of been good ,then he started talking on the phone....ZZZzzzz. well thats that. thats all,bye... later."
1,Just awful!,"As a horror movie fanatic I was anxious to see this per reviews. I have to say these reviews must be fake...this movie is the worst. I see exactly what the writer/director were going for, but they missed the mark. Killer(who comes off as mentally challenged not crazy), actor/actresses who could take a lesson from any elementary school production, camera work that is ""shaky"" at best....buyer beware...skip this and spend your time watching infomercials,they are more exciting."
3,"An unapologetic, classic-style slasher film","Just when you think you've seen every 80's slasher, a new one appears.... in 2012. Nowadays, it seems directors will only make a slasher if it's a parody or the characters (e.g. Scream) are self-aware of ""the rules"". The young director of The Sleeper, who probably wasn't born the year his film was set, made an unapologetic, formulistic 80's slasher film. Bravo! I love formulaic movies if the formula is solid. And the classic slasher formula has the works: beautiful girls, a mysterious killer, slow building tension, gratuitous nudity, leap outs, kills, and, of course, the sweet, quick-footed final girl. Other film makers try to re-invent the wheel and end up with movies about ghost-werewolves. Give me tried and true. The Sleeper is not perfect, but I enjoyed this ""period piece"". Despite a small budget, it captured the spirit of the genre in so many ways."
4,DEADTIME STORY,"THE SLEEPER is a throwback to the early 80s slasher flicks and succeeds in capturing that era's mindless slayings. The film is reminiscent of Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN, the ""Sleeper"" substituting for Michael Myers' boogeyman. Unlike HALLOWEEN, there's more gore and brutality in THE SLEEPER. We don't know who the Sleeper really is or why he's focused on the sorority girls but that's really irrelevant. It's just a slasher film. There are some spooky scenes of tension and the Sleeper's sardonic humor is effective. The cast of unknowns die convincingly but no potential Jamie Lee Curtises!THE SLEEPER is not destined to be a classic but considering its budget, it's better than many of its contemporaries."
2,Coffee Table ho-hum,"While the book is titled The Swimming Pool, I think it is more about the ""outdoor room"" The ""Classic"" pools are still more lavish than will be helpful to the average pool owner. A good book to use for a few weeks from your public library.Pool Owner [...]"
3,Great inspirational story,"This story seems entirely fictitious until you get to the end and realize the main character of the story was inspired by a real man who ran a 900 kilometer race from Melbourne to Sydney and one a $10,000 prize, only to split his winnings with the other contestants. The farmer in the story, who derives his energy from eating fresh pumpkins runs everywhere on his farm. He is extremely fit despite his age and insists on racing in his overalls and work boots.This book, which is beautifully illustrated by Brad Sneed, will inspire children to follow their hearts and dreams and to disregard the negative comments often shared by others.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"
1,WALLET,"WALLET IS OK, ZIPPER ENDS KEEP COMING OFF EVERYTIME YOU NEED TO OPEN THE WALLET. NOT MADE FOR DURABILITY. OR EVEN FOR DAILY USAGE."
1,Don`t buy this,"Probably the store that sells this item wrote the first review, don`t buy this item it is a very low quality one...If I would have seen it first i would have payed 1$ max for it.I`m returning it now..."
5,Forever Maturing Is Alphaville,"Marion and the band have matured with each album and while most people recall the pop of Forever Young & Big In Japan (although hardly enough to actually make them a household name stateside) this album has a more mature and sophisticated electronic sound. As always, Gold's vocals are otherworldly and few can match his sound and range (accept Morten Harket of A-ha) and the music truly elevates his voice. ""Fools"" and ""The Impossible Dream"" were stand out singles, but ""Iron John"" is so infectious and easily the greatest Alphaville song EVER. The reggae-tinged ""Faith"" sounds like the opening track to a fun summer blockbuster movie and is guaranteed to get you going in the morning. The title seems so far removed from the music, and perhaps many people can't figure it out, but this album is fantastic."
4,The gifted ones,I like most the songs on this album. Some songs were weird but good. I love these guys so much i will like almost anything they do. Not as good as old stuff but still a keeper.
4,A fun book,"Ellies life is not going according to plan. She just broke up with her boyfriend and had to find her own place to live, her mother breezed into town after leaving her father because he had an affair, and her ex fiancé, whom she never really got over, is now her new boss at work and the sparks are about to fly.Body Language is a fun, light, easy read that you will enjoy if you are a fan of chick lit. You will also adore Ellie and get a kick out of her mother and bull dog."
1,Too Bad This One Didn't Come With a Money Back Guarantee,"I've enjoyed this authors previous works, so I was thrilled when I saw a new title. However, I found the story to be inconsistent, (time wise), and the characters dialogue and actions were wooden. The use of calling someone 'love' after almost every sentence was overkill and annoyed me to no end."
4,"Outstanding book, Arendish scenes a little drawn out though","I have not as yet read Edding's Sparhawk series but I have read all of the Mallorean and Belgariad. Belgarath was a fantastic sequel, and Polgara just made it better. I am sick of all these weirdos from New Zealand trashing on Polgara. I was simply enthralled with the story line and the characters. I will admit that the scenes in Arendia were a little drwan out and exhausting, but that is only a minor setback. THIS was a great book and I strongly recommend it to Edding's fans."
2,Polgara the Sorceress--Slow Going from a Fast Paced Author,"The long anticipated Polgara the Sorceress is, unfortunately, not as great as its predecessors. The pace is extremely slow, the events covered not nearly as interesting as the glimpses of them in the other books promised and, worst of all...where's Polgara? The first person narrative is clearly an imposter for the cool, wry, disgruntled sorceress we have come to know and love. This one's overly emotional, especially in the Arendia section. One would almost mistake the three-thousand year old for a girl of thirteen! There are a few cute parts, and her view does round out the entire thirteen part saga (including the book of various prophecies recently released), but slowly...slowly. So, go ahead and read Polgara the Sorceress if you're on a Belgarath the Sorcerer high, but make sure you've got plenty of time and attention."
2,"having read all the other books, Polgara just doesn't work","Although the story is well written, the book disputes many of the other stories. Having read all the previous books, I was disapointed in Polgara. However if I had never read any of the previous books I would be inclined to say Polagara was an excellent piece of the fantasy Genre. I believe David Eddings could have done a much better job if he had taken the time to research his own novels."
1,"For the Love of God, STOP!!!","Thanks to the Gods I borrowed this book frome a friend, and didn't spend the money. The Bel/Mel series was a decent read but, let it end there. The phrase ""Beating a dead horse"" comes to mind here. Sorry but, ENOUGH ALREADY!!! I used to like Polgara until I read this book, it makes her look like a spoiled pain in the *blank*. I could site numerous occasions when Belgarath should have bent her over his knee. *rant* *rant*. I just hate it when a good series is ruined. I really should have never read this thing."
1,3000 long years with no new plotlines,"I'm a huge fan of the Belgarion/Malorion series. I liked the quick wit, the humorous exchanges between the characters,and the plot. I had really been waiting for this new Bel/Mal book to happen.But ""Polgara"" left me disappointed, retelling that already twice told long story of what Pol and Belgareth did during 3000 years when noting much of a plot happend, before the actual series (Bel /Mal) started. Just adding the angle of Polgara's perception is definately not enough to salt this journal-of-a-time-of-waiting. It has little entertaining value, and a shrill lack of tension. If the Eddingses wanted to show that this is simply what longevity is like, well, than the succeeded. But I think it's a real pitty, because there is so much more that can be done with the good set of characters the they created in the Bel/Mal. I do hope they start a NEW plot/series with them."
1,I feel cheated.,"I have been a fan of David Eddings for years now and have always enjoyed with great anticipation a new installment of this story. However, with this book I was completely cheated. The only review that is adequate is ""I spent time and money on this?!"""
3,A total REHASH,"I don't know what's up with this book getting so many 8+ scores. This book was a complete rehash of ""Belgarath"" with very little new enlightenment about the world they live in. While entertaining and an easy read, I would recommend waiting for the paperback if you're an Eddings fan. Otherwise skip it."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!,"I'm only 12 and have read the belgariad/mallorean and LOVED them. Belgarath the Sorcerer was O.K. but, POLGARA WAS GREAT!!!! The story of her love for Ontrose her greif when Beldaran died, and the proud Dutchess of Erat. A WONDERFUL piece of lit."
4,"If you have the others, get this, if not, don't.","This book pretty much wraps up the world of The Belgariad. I'm sorry to see it end, but I can't see anyplace left to go, except maybe some short stories (I'm eager to see how the main characters cope with the outbreak of world peace). Since I already had the other books, I'm glad to have bought this one, but I really don't think I'd have liked it if I'd started with it. I hope to see Eddings write some new stuff (Hopefully getting away from ""Hero takes powerful intelligent magic rock and defeats gods,"" which has been fun, but overdone?)."
2,Stretching a good series too far.,"D.E. is a terrific writer, but I couldn't let a '4 star average' review stand on this novel without doing my part to reduce it. The book was well below his and Leigh's usual excellance. I wouldn't want them to see this review, because I'm sure they worked very hard on the book. But I must suggest you read the Belgarion and Mallorean and stop there!Polgara is a fine and noble character, but halfway through this book she becomes a shrewish, annoying egotist who doesn't learn or say anything new. I was fascinated by her tales of growing up, and thrilled by her years as the Duchess of Erat. Good stuff there! New characters! Killane is wonderful.After that, I'm afraid it deteriorates into one long whining rehash with only an occasional glimmer of her original nobility."
5,Polgara the Great,Polgara the Sorceress was a great book which helped me fill in a lot of spaces which Belegarth the Sorcerer left out. I have to say that David and Leigh Eddings know how to keep their history straight.
2,Dissapointing effort by Eddings,"Even if it did have some interesting moments, this novel read more like a dime-store romance. The world, and the characters created by Mr. Eddings are complex and fascinating, but do we really need to read the same old story Again? If the author wishes to expand on his creation, how about a novel featuring Silk, with a storyline completely unrelated to the events we have already read about in the Belgariad, its sequel and its prequel Belgarath/Polgara?"
5,True Eddings admirer.,"The ""Polgara View"" of the whole ""Eddings' World"" is, yes, predictable, but lovingly and joyfully so. Polgara can be no one but Polgara and if the character was to be written any other way would be very disappointing. It's like coming home to a house that is filled with a familarity and security that generates a homey comfort. All of the Eddings' books have this quality along with the adventure and mystery, of course. I notice that the ones who give poor reviews of these books continue to read them. Why, if a person so vehemently dislikes a book, or anything for that matter, then why, why, WHY would they continue to torment themselves by reading the next book in the story series? If you don't like the Eddings style of writing, then quite naturally you won't have anything good to say about any of their books. It makes better sense for someone who actually likes this particular style of writing to review it in an honest fashion to promote significant feedback."
2,What Happen?????,"Nobody is a bigger fan for the Bel/Mal series than me. As much as I loved those books and Belegarath, I hated Polgara!!! What happen to the wit and fun? This book plods on and on about nothing. I would love to see a new adventure begin with Eriond, and friends. True fans don't bother, go back and re-read the first books."
1,POLGARA THE SORCERESS...OR FEMINIST?,"The book itsel is boring, starting off well with details of Polgara's early life and her connection with her sister Beldaran. Then she goes to Vo Wacune, and everything goes downhill from there. We are treated to her boring account of her rapid rise to power as the Duchess of Erat(with very little actual effort on her part) as we found out that all Arendia loves Polgara because she's so perfect."
1,Coat Tails,Obviously a case of Leigh doing most (if not all of the writing) and riding on the coatails of her husbands name recognition. I am sure this would not have been published without Davids name. It is not very sophisticated writing and Polgara is awful immature for someone hundreds of years old. She acts like a spoiled 16 year old.
5,This is a very intriging book.,Polgara The Sorceress is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. It portrays an alternate fantasy world in ways I've never read about before. It's very original and exciting.
3,it was an ok book,Didn't you think all the characters were smug? It seemed refreshing in the first two series but I got tired of it by the time I finished this book.
3,"David Eddings' books are exciting, but plain.","I think that this book was a great finish to the Belgariad\Mallorean series. It covered just about everything that I'd wondered about. However, as in all of Mr. Edding's books, all of the characters begin to lose their individuality. Here is a line: ""Nobody's perfect!"" This line is a good turnaround comeback, and is funny the first time a character says it. However, pretty soon, two or three characters are saying it every time they are accused of being 'Dishonest' or 'a scoundral'. Edding's work is great for younger readers, but I would truly recommend some Robert Jordan, or Stephen R. Donaldson for people that like a bit more than a predictable story with predictable characters."
1,Clashes with other books!!!!!,"I will not waste a lot more time on this book. It was extremely disappointing. This book contradicts many ""facts"" from other books in the series. The book is also laced with poorly thought out comments by the author (Polgera, herself). If you felt that the series was sexist and in desperate need of having the male characters made fools of, then this book is for you. If you enjoyed the other ten (eleven or twelve now) then leave this one alone."
3,"Good enough, I guess.","I didn t actually read The Rivan Codex or Belgarath the Sorcerer yet, but I found out that Polgara is no match for The Belgariad or The Malloreon series. Especially I hated those exclamations bettween the storrytelling. But as usual I couldn t put the book down untill the end."
3,Love the story,"Dina Pearlman's narrative dramatization lacks characterization. She reads well, however, her voice doesn't represent the characters well; particularly the male characters. The narration dramatizations of both Polgara the Sorceress and Belgarath the Sorcerer should have been better done by Robin Williams who does excellent male and female voices, by the woman who played Dharma on Dharma and Greg, or by a group of two or more actors and a few sound effects."
2,kinda dull,"Well, when I first started reading Eddings, I thought his books were amazing. Fortunately, I had started out with the Belgariad. Although his other works are imaginative, the humor gets a little stale...it's all the same thing! After the Belgariad, Eddings should have made up some new jokes. After his other books, Polgara was a bore."
1,BORING,"I always liked Enddings. When I bought this book I was not very sure, because I was studing for my exams and I thought that if I started another Eddings book I would never get any study done. Big mistake!It is one of the most boring books I ever read, I couldn't even finish it. This book has nothing to do with the rest of Eddings books; I hoped to find a book with lots of action and I found a very slow book, with no action and poor characters. The only good thing about this book is that it did not steal my time and I could prepare my exams.And I pass them..!"
3,Let's Hear From Poledra,"I found Polgara too perfect for the entire series.As Belgarath says, "" She has always been just a little too sure of herself."" I was fascinated with Poledra and her wolf persona. Beldin was also a thoroughly enjoyable fellow. I would like to read Poledra's bio, as well as Beldin's. Silk could follow, and just how are we going to extend his life anyway? I can't stand the thought of Barak, Relg, Taiba, Silk and Hettar expiring while the whining sniveling dryad Ce'Nedra gets to hang on for a long time and have tons 'o babies. I know, I know, the whole point of the series is that time and destiny march on...but still, I really liked these guys.Also, I have read Jordan, Tolkien, Martin, Goodkind. I have found value in all of them. Why don't I hear people mention Donaldson or Hickman/Tracy or the Shannara series???"
1,"Please, no more ..","I have this very strong urge to read everything connected with the Bel/Mal series, but this last book spoiled the pleasure I experienced reading the Belgariad. I'm thoroughly bored by Polgara, who seems to know what's good for everyone. Knowing what she was like as a teenager was totally unbelievable to me. I've started rereading the Bel/Mal series and this last book has managed to spoil those for me. I've come to the conclusion that the best part of ALL these books is the first page of the first book: the smells in Faldor's kitchen. What's beginning to irritate more and more are the female characters, they are flat as (rice)paper. They seem to develop or change but three books later they still react in the same smug manner. So that's why I say: ""no more"". I want to keep some of the pleasure I felt reading it the first time. (Apoligies if my English isn't quite good, my milklanguage is Dutch)"
1,ACK ACK ACK,"Oh my freaking goodness, I wanted to punch that jerk of a sorceress in the face. She is soooooo stinking mean to Belgarath that it makes me want to hurt her. Now I do own this book and it isn't all that bad it still only gets one star cause she is such a jerk"
3,This book was well developed & filled in a lot of gaps.,"Although the book had few new surprises it did answer alot of the previous ""skimmed over"" histories. The Eddings' illustrated quite well the hardships & sacrifices made by this extraordinary woman to protect and ward Riva's and Beldaran's line. The quick dry wit that we all have come to admire in this gifted family still runs true in this book and makes us laugh along with the characters being made sport of. The only major dissapointment to the book is that it didn't go into detail on Pol's relationship with her ""uncles"" as well as not explaining why she avoided taking her mother's true form. (only one instance in the Mallorean). All in all the book is very entertaining and is a must read for everyone who has read the previous books."
5,A wonderful book.,"This is the first Eddings book I have read. I'm hooked! Polgara the Sorceress is the last part of The Belgariad epic. If you haven't read any of The Belgariad books, don't worry this book stands on its own. I would recommend this book to anyone. It has all the ingredients for any great fantasy; magic, adventure, mystery, and humor weaved around unforgetable characters."
4,The classic Eddings we've seen before,"A wonderful history of the world of the Belgariad & Mallorean, finally told through the eyes of Polgara. It clarifies some mysteries from Belgarath the Sorcerer and other related novels by explaining exactly what was going on with Poledra, but a good deal of it repeated the history presented earlier by Belgarath. It's the Eddings we've come to love, with his vivid character portrayals and sarcasm, but his running on the same plotline for twelve novels is getting tiresome. I would recommend this for fans of his work, though not for those who don't have a fairly strong attachment to his characters."
5,Bre's,"I haven't enjoyed a book so much in a long time. This book is fabulous! The characters are real and vivid. The plot is good. Written with a distinct feminist slant, the book is characterised with sly humour that make such a long book much easier to read. The relationships in this book are truly heart-warming. Fascinating. For anyone who loves a good fantasy story, this is a must."
3,Good but not,"i have read the Belgariad, the Malloreon, and Belgarath and thought all of them were great. When reading this book i found out something. Eddings is a great writer but Polgara has lead a very boaring life. There where some realy good parts but the rest we all ready know about."
2,It took me 2 years to read this book,"I was a big fan of the Belgariad and the Malloreon and I did enjoy Belgarath the Sorceror, but I have never read a more boring fantasy book then this one. My wife teased me that I would never finish it, so I read it when I had nothing else to read. This was a major disappointment. I am now reading the Redemption of Althatus (sp) and I'm happy to see that the Eddings are still capable of writing a good story. At some point in the fantasy genre especially, the sequels have to end."
2,Worst ebook conversion ever,"Don't get me wrong, I like this book (I've even got the hard cover version on my shelf), but the lack of attention paid to the conversion of this book is appalling. The Kindle version is full of conversion issues like letters being converted to numbers (such as ""I'll"" being converted to ""I 11""); contracting / misconverting of letters like ""rn"" to ""m""; poor hyphenation of words (this happens a bit in ebooks, but it stuck out for me in this one); and various other conversion issues. It was quite clear that no one bothered to proof read this before it was pushed out the door. Pity, because otherwise it's a good book."
2,Only read if you love Eddings,"I'm not a huge eddings fan. I read his books many years ago and recently picked up Polgara. Ug, what a slog. I have never wanted an arrow to pierce the heart of a protagonist until now. The main character, Polgara, is a self indulgent, controlling, snob. Somehow she has all the knowledge of modern day living, as well as the language, sans technology, but she lives in a feudal, medieval society. She is incredibly condescending and patronizing to everyone. Also, somehow everyone around her seems to be an idiot except herself. She has no qualms about condemning the immorality of her adversaries and then has no issue with using torture herself.Unless you are a huge Eddings fan, this book will simply make you gag. She is basically a spoiled princess goddess among men and treats everyone with that attitude. If you have ever had to deal with this type of personality, you just want to slap them."
4,Good - but redundant,"David Eddings and his wife must be running out of ideas which is unfortunate. I have been fascinated with the world of the Belgariad and Mallorean. When the Belgarath and Polgara books came out I pounced on them ready to be awed once more. Belgarath was good - filled in a few holes the other ten books left empty. Unfortunately Polgara basically retold the story of Belgarath with only a few small, but interesting, insights into how Polgara grew up and the forces that molded her. A good book but I wish it had gone in a different direction and explored new territory - too much retelling of the same story. I slight disappointment but still a good read."
4,"Good book to read, but not as good as the earlier books.","Polgara the sorceress is a good book to read but gets a bit long winded in the middle, during her time in Vo Wacune. I enjoyed reading about her early life and the battle at Vo Mimbre. I recommend this book only if you have read the Belgariad and the Mallorean and if you want to know about what happened before them."
2,not as good as the rest,"I found out about David Eddings in seventh grade and have been caught up in the lives of Garion and his family ever since. However, Polgara's book is a disappointment. I waited for it for so long and, after reading it twice, am unhappy with it. She comes across as whiny and not as powerful as we have been led to believe. The Eddings' humor, which I loved so much in the other eleven books, gets a little old by the end and there are some fairly obvious inconsistancies, both in reference to the previous series and within the book itself-- they seem almost like editing mistakes. The other books far surpass this one in every aspect."
5,Faboulous Story. Great prequel to the Belgariad.,"In the words of Holy Gorim just before the Angarak Invasion and the Battle of Vo Mibre, ""Sacred Polgara"", this is a fitting story to a wonderful series. Eddings and his wife have shown the truth behind the beautiful woman whom has given birth to a country and nurtured the lives of a royal line. Get lost in amazement as you realize the intense bond between twin sisters who must be seperated to save the world. Experience the love a mother has for her daughter and feel the embrace of that same mother's warm and she leads her daughter through the emense task that is the life of Polgara the Sorceress. Buy it, read it. Read it again."
2,"Good, but anecdotict compare to the rest of the serie","For a long time, I have been a big DE's fan. But now, I'm disappointed. We don't learn any new things, there are contradictions with some of the others books: a useless book. It seems to me that DE can't write anything new. In the Tamuli, there is no great change. In fact I think that DE just wants to make money, using his old success. So, don't read that book, and don't buy it."

4,This book tells you all you wanted to know about Pol,This book tells you all you wanted to know about Pol and has a great insight to her thoughts as well as her feeling and her distress at about the distruction of Vo Wacune and her distress at losing her twin sister Beldaran her bravery for minding the long line of Rivan kings and waiting for the GodSlayer. Also her love for her father which they kept for thousands of years a game. All this book is just literally Polgara.
4,You mean I have to read ANOTHER one??,"I will admit, that I did enjoy another Eddings novel.. But come on! How many times can we milk the same story. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the sarcasm and banter Mr. Eddings seems to have mastered, but the book seemed to be more of a male bashing adventure than the classic tales. Too much influence from ""other"" sources, (and you fans know what I mean). Plus, I had a hard time trying to finish it, pretty much being able to predict most of the book as it went along, anyway. Judge for yourself."
5,The best book I have ever read,"I could not put this book down, and when I had finished it I wish I hadn't! The plot is brilliant and if you're a fan of the Eddings duo then you will love this book"
2,Disappointing,"The end of the novel is by far the most interesting. That's when you get to see the culmination of the different personalities and the situations they put themselves in. The rest of the novel is a too dry tale of a man and woman having an affair and having many long scholarly discussions about the differences in their religions (she is a jew, he is a christian) and the nature of their beliefs. Unfortunately, nothing interesting ever is said and nothing of note ever takes place. Yawn. A time waster."
4,"It is what it says, a workout DVD","This is very much like an aerobics workout video but with belly dancing moves. The moves are called out with counts, but there is no explaination given on how to properly do them. If you have taken classes or learned the moves before hand this is a great way to practice the moves and get your heart rate up. It is very modern and not traditional at all. I would be cautious about trying to learn from this DVD since is never mentions the importance of proper posture and you could easily hurt yourself. For me, it was just what I was looking for and I have enjoyed using it."
2,I didn't like this very much,"There are better belly dancing videos out there, in my opinion. didn't use this video more than twice. Instead, I recommend Blanca's Sensual Belly Dance DVD. It's much more fun and well thought out. I"
5,"Fun workout, great dance moves","This is a great dvd loaded with fun dance moves and interesting combinations that not only give you a fantastic workout but will also add some spice to your dance routines. I love the way Jehan uses different dancers of varying body types as instructors for each section. The outfits that the dancers wear are very cute and will also give you some neat ideas on how to turn ""club wear"" into eye-catching belly dance costumes. Get this dvd - it's worth every penny you will pay for it. Thanks Jehan for producing such a fun - and informational - workout!"
5,Revel in your body as you exercise!,"I personally do not think this workout is for beginners, as the dancers do movements such as ""lotus hands"", ""snake arms"" and ""relevé"" without demonstrating first; if you already know what they are talking about, you'll be just fine! The workout consists of the warmup (9 minutes), strength (8 minutes, lots of hip drops and hip rolls), sensuality (7 minutes, lots of arm movements and chest circles), joy (6 minutes, lots of bouncing and leg kicks), passion (3 minutes, hips and chest), energy (5 minutes, lots of shimmies), and the cooldown (6 minutes.) The movements in all the different workouts were very fluid and the outfits were a visual feast, from the traditional chiffon skirt and midriff top to hip-hugging jeans with hip scarves and jeweled belts. The music, World Music by Desert Wind, was fitting and inspirational. You will definitely get a good workout, not ""bellydance style"", but actual bellydance."
4,Get in touch with your inner goddess!,"I loved this DVD! Great workout, very sensuous and spiritual and fun. I thought the dancers were beautiful and talented.The two reasons I didn't give this DVD a perfect 5 stars are:(1) no instruction beforehand on the moves(2) that annoying logo that appears on every frame!I have done the twins (Neena and Veena) workout for beginners and enjoyed it very much. I was ready for more of a challenge and this one is definitely that. Got my heart racing, that's for sure!"
1,Not pleased at all,"I have never given a bad review, but I feel it necessary this time. I personally really hated this video. I cannot understand why so many reviews have so many stars! The overall quality of this video is really bad. The whole thing seems cheap, including the dancers who look so gaudy that it's actually distracting.I am so glad that this was not my first belly dancing video because I probably would've given it up before I started. This was only played once and I will now give it away.I believe that [...] are so much better quality, including their dancing. They speak class and style all the way around, not cheap & gaudy which is the first things that come to mind when I think of this particular video."
3,Sorry but YUK!,I was disappointed. This is definitely NOT an instructional DVD on bellydance. It was several segments of 3 women in jeans with bras or in tight black pants with bras doing simple bellydance moves. I prefer an instructional or artistic approach to bellydance. There was no effort put into pleasing surroundings. All of the sequences are against a stark white background. This DVD might work for if your reason for bellydance is to go to night clubs and bust a few moves. The DVD menu selecter was also annoying.
1,Ultimate Bellydance Workout,"The title of this dvd is misleading. It isn't anything about fitness, more about the dancers showing off their moves and their costumes. It's very hard to follow."
4,Bellydance fitness,The DVD was easy to follow and provides for quite the workout. This one will make you sweat!
1,I'd skip this one,"I personally won't use this DVD again. I'm not a beginner, but I hate not having verbal commands (when hanging heads, etc.). I thought it looked cheap (from make-up to costumes to set). I found that side graphic quite annoying. The people hardly smiled. Overall bad experience for me."
2,"Eh, not terrible, but there is better out there","I've had this video awhile, and it can be fun if you get into it, but I wouldn't say its for beginners. The moves are a bit fast and a few of the moves are a little complicated. All in all I would say give it a miss in favor of something by Rania or Jillina."
2,The Temple of BLAH,"I'm somewhere in the intermediate range of bellydancing. I've been doing it for about a year and have taken a class and done a couple DVD's. I am, by no means, an expert, but I am a fairly good dancer by nature. And I don't care much for this one.1. The narration is useless. The ONLY way to follow along is visually. The narrarator will commonly tell you to go into some pose, or do some move, but she's using a name like, ""temple pose"" without explaining it.2. There is no slow break-down of the moves. I can see how a highly experienced dancer might get bored by that part, and therefore, enjoy the lack of direction in the DVD. But some of the moves can harm your back and neck and there is no attempt made to teach these moves in a safe way. I call that sloppy and irresponsible.3. Eh. Nothing moved me. It wasn't horrible, but it seemed very low budget.This is definitely an exercise DVD and not an instructional dance DVD. It was a disappointing gift, but at least I didn't pay for it."
2,It is what it is,Not to happy with this video. Some of the choreography seemed to have been made up on the spot during the recording. It was hard for me to follow and the dancers didn't seem to 'mind their posture' while doing the moves which made the execution some what sloppy and unattractive. I am disappointed with this video and am hesitant on purchasing another from this company.
2,not for the advanced,"I personally don't think that this workout explains how to do the moves very well besides the fact that I don't feel I benefited from the routines. I find them boring, and there's not enough focus on the isolations that really define belly dancing. I have been a dancer all my life and belly dancing for 6 years now and I know a quality video (even for beginners) when I see one, and this would not be one that I recommend."
3,Are you getting bored with your bellydance workouts?,"Then this might be the ticket. The theme is *variety* on this fitness DVD. It is an inexpensive DVD and fun workout, but minus two stars for the very low production quality and highly varied skill level of the dancers. Some of the dancers do have excellent technique and polish, but this is a big departure from the quality and consistency you find with bellytwins or superstars DVDs."
4,Great Workout,I have done this once. But the next day I felt great and felt the burn. The energy is high and it is very fun.
3,Learn more about martial arts,"The book ain't exactly about a ninja, but about the Sensei, of the League of Assassins. Learn more about his feud with Bruce here."
4,excellent,"smells like teen spirit has to be one of the greatses songs ever written and nirvana are, to me, the beatles for my generation but better. this ep has three songs. SLTS, even in his youth and aneuryism. even in his youth is a great song that is straight on rock. if you have not heard aneuryism then your missing out. it is dynamic and rocking full of everything we love about nirvana."
5,Fast and Furious,The song is a true thrasher filled with guitar and drumming. Its a lot louder than most of their songs but definetly a winner
1,Blatant Pixies Ripoff,"The first time I heard this song, I would easily have given it 4 stars. Great music, decent vocals...in fact, I enjoyed it a great deal. The second time I heard this song, I thought, ""Hmm...this sounds awfully familiar for some reason, but I'm not sure why."" The third time I played this song, I played ""U-Mass"" by the Pixies immediately afterward and figured out where I had heard it before.This song is basically a melange of Pixies songs, primarily ""U-Mass,"" grafted together and repackaged under this band's name. That said, there is nothing remotely innovative or even creative to be found here. Yes, it's a nice song, but it's basically been done already, and it's been done infinitely better.Please, I beg of you: Direct your funds to their rightful recipient by purchasing either ""Come on Pilgrim"" or ""Wave of Mutilation."" Don't waste your time on this inferior knock-off."
4,"Teen Spirit is awesome, but the others are no good (yuck!)","Teen Spirit is awesome, but the rest of the songs on here are horribble. Not even worth your money. Even In Her Youth is sloppy and unprofessional. It's not poppy like Teen Spirit ether. I didn't spend however much this cost everybody else to hear two out of three songs that are crappy. Kurdt, your legacy lives on in fans like me who wished you could have pushed yourself to the max and done more professial recordings like the jaw-gapingly brilliant Nevermind.Rest In Peace, Kurdt D. Koibayne (+_+)"
5,Nirvana will never fade away...,"Seriously. This song and this band in general have the timeless talent that hadn't been seen since DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and PHYSICAL GRAFFITI. Well actually millions more remember those albums more than this single, if they evn know this single exists. This is not Nirvanas best single, that would be 'Heart-Shaped Box', but it still is at either #2 or #3. This is the song that opened the doors for me, if it wasn't for Nirvana then I wouldn't have been a rock fan. I owe so much to Kurt and the band and they will always be my #1 favorite band, not even 80's Metallica or Led Zeppelin can beat them. This is a great single with very good b-sides, if you are lucky enough to come across this single then buy it without delay, becuase chances are it wont be available later..."
5,Awesome,"This is a great single with Smells Like Teen Spirit, Aneurysm, And Even In His Youth, From The Hormoaning Import. If u like nirvana this is something to get along with the other 5 singles they have. Just for keeps shake."
5,Wonders of the children,"Since I am not a child it is great to read a book from a child's view. Darby Carmichael is a wonderful character in this book. The base of the story is something every child needs to learn about. So as a teacher it could be used as a history lesson. This is a must have, must read book!"
4,"When I received the tissues I thought, """"Why ...","When I received the tissues I thought, """"Why did you do this? The weather is great and you don't need these."""" But 24 hours later I had an awful cold. The menthol, although too strong when I'm healthy, was great at clearing my stuffy nose. They're soft too, so my nose wasn't bright red all the time. Since I live in a suburb outside of Buffalo, New York, I'm sure these will come in very handy during our cold winter months. I'll definitely purchase this product when I'm sick."
3,The Kleenex tissues had a menthol smell that ...,"The Kleenex tissues had a menthol smell that was extremely strong. That smell definitely cleared out my sinuses, but it was a bit overpowering for me. These tissues would be helpful for people with severe congestion due to a cold or illness. However, for everyday use I don't feel they're practical. I wouldn't recommend this product for daily use, but they would be good to keep in the house for times of sickness."
2,Erotic adventures in Old Italy,"I've read many Black Lace novels. This one was average, or maybe a little below average in my view.Carla wants to be an artist,but females are not allowed to do anything that interesting in Renaissance Italy. So, she disguises herself as a boy, and goes to work in Piero's studio. Piero soon discovers her secret. He makes her his not unwilling lover, but it's Marco, a young apprentice she really craves. How can she seduce Marco when he thinks she is a boy?I couldn't really get into this story because I thought Marco was not a particularly interesting love interest. He was rather one dimensional Also, it seemed like the author suddenly realized she was running out of time, and ended the book bery abruptly.This was not my favorite Black Lace novel, but it was far from my least favorite."
2,An interesting book,Not one of Lafay's best books. Some scenes were medium-hot while many others were just flat. The plot was pretty good.
4,Perfect Snack,I've tried a lot of banana chips but these are the best. Nice flavor.........not too sweet. Just the right amount of crunch. Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.
3,Enjoyable but slight,"____________________________________________Allie, a drifty California college student, is fighting with her dad over her faltering education, and a boyfriend that Dad doesn't like. He's planning to send her to a college in France -- but she somehow ends up in the Coindra College of Magical Arts, which is considerably further away. Hijinks ensue.""B-"", enjoyable but slight. I picked it up because an aquaintance recommended it. Regular fantasy readers are likely to enjoy it more than I did.For a stronger Ball novel, I recommend trying FLAMEWEAVER, an alt-hist with magic in Central Asia & China, atmospheric and quite good. ""A-/B+""Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
5,This was a really good fantasy!,I had never read any of Margaret Ball's books when I found this at our local bookstore. I thought the cover looked neat and that the synopsis sounded interesting. I read this book in 2 hours! It was fast-paced and had great charcters!
5,Great way to hear this soundtrack,"I have heard some of these songs on compilation cds but somehow they sound so much better on this release. First I want to say I love the Original Album premise. I am too young to have ever seen the actual vinyls but when I see the packaging of this album I feel this is the closest I'll ever get to hearing these songs in the way I imagined my dad used to hear them when he was young (my love of elvis music was passed down from him to the rest of my family) Elvis has always been a great link between me and my dad, and after he passed away I can't help but to think how he would have loved how they reissue his albums and movies. But this is one of those times where I can at least see how it might have felt to be him and to open an elvis record for the first time, and seeing the tracklist/artwork. I'd highly recommend this cd as well as this series (the original albums re-released/remastered)"
2,don't buy these,"My non-profit company bought these as a performance tool for our puppet shows. They are not loud enough, and they distort quite easily. not worth the money. The simplicity does not balance out the poor quality. It also doesn't garner any respect from the audience, as it is visually cumbersome and dated. No body wears fanny-packs anymore."
2,My kids do not like it,"My kids do not like it. After I bought it, they might played once or twice.The good thing is that it does not make kids addict to it. Some of the games are designed to make kids addicted to it (that is very bad)."
2,Trauma Center Second Opinior/Wii,"This game is very fun, until about when you get 8% of the way done, you have to draw a star on the patients chest to slow down time and they say its a magical tuch. It is so retarded I just stoped playing, it is hard to draw the star, and by the time you do you are almost out of time.It would be a great game but they had to screw it up and waste my money."
3,"Needs some work, but worth the play","Trauma Center: Second Opinion is not a game for people who aren't willing to sit through screen after screen of a boring (and poorly written) plot. The story itself is lame, at best, and doesn't really make you like any of the characters.Once you finally make it through the excruciating script and get the the surgeries, the fun finally happens. The controls are quite easy and the surgeries, though they vary in difficulty, are really quite entertaining.If only the nurse would stop shouting ""Doctor!""The creators of the game should re-release the game once they do two things: 1) get a better script and 2) make an option to skip the story mode and just do the action parts."
4,Fun & Challenging,"This is one of those games that you concentrate so completely on that you eventually look up and wonder how the last hour flew by so quickly! In fact, I would strongly recommend only playing this if you can give it your undivided attention for a while; the surgeries are cumulative in the sense that a procedure that gets introduced in one surgery is often critical for the next one. So, if you didn't pay close attention the first time something appears in the game, you're going to be completely lost in the next procedure. This is definitely NOT an easy game by any means (even on the easy setting), but if you want a different challenge than your typical first person shooter, then this is the game for you."
2,A Rental - Dialog heavy,"In short-- The surgery is fun. However, the BABBLING is Awful. It can takes minutes to click through the screens you arent even reading. After three hours of playing I eventually handled like 5 or 6 surgerys. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They even interupt you with dialog during surgery causing you to make mistakes. Rent for the novelty but dont waste your money."
2,boring unless you like to read,"More reading then anything, game was accurate. If you need to cut or stitch didnt matter how straight it was. Got prefects when I hurried or went slow, no difference. Not recommended"
1,TOO MUCH READING/ACONTROL DIFFICULT,"My husband is a physican so I thought he would like this game. There is just too much talking and reading! When you finally get to surgery, the controls are too sensitive especially when it comes to handling the forceps. At one point, when we finally figured out how to handle the controls, time was up and the surgery failed. I think with a little redesign, this game would be fun."
2,Disappointing,"The plot was boring and tedious. If you could skip past it, it wouldnt so bad, but every time you kill a patient, you have to endure the dialogue again and skip past endless screens just to try again. The gameplay was awkward and confusing at times. No instructions within the game, and I'm too lazy to read the booklet, so the learning was trial and error, and it was not intuitive."
5,Trauma Center Deserves Second Opinion,"Atlus definately shows its strengths with this launch title. The gameplay, using both the Remote and Nunchuck, make Trauma Center feel fluid to your hands - and they need to be, because as you progress through the storyline, you quickly discover you need the fastest fingers on the planet.The game begins simple enough, with basic surgery of lacerations and the like, but something gruesome happens in the year 2018, and you need to be quick on your feet and quicker in your hands. You will feel your palms sweat and your body shake as you try to remove the most bizzare and deadly diseases with not a moment to spare save for wiping the sweat from your forehead.This is no childrens game. By the end, this game will keep you and your onlookers at the edge of their seats, not from the long, winding and enjoyable (I like soaps) storyline, but from the near impossible surgeries that you pull off usually by the skin of your teeth.A required launch game. Do not rent. Buy."
4,Great Game!,I bought this game for my girlfriend who is interested in going into the medical field and she loves it! I think it is a great idea. the story of the game is kind of cheesy but none the less you get to perform life like surgeries.I bought it for $12 plus shipping and i felt like i got a great deal.I would recommend this to anyone who is into medical stuff like TV shows or what not.
5,Buy this game,"First off, this game is fun. It's addictive. It's challenging but not so hard that you want to give up. The story lines are entertaining, the game play is great. This is my first game for the Wii besides Sports and Play, and I can't get enough."
4,Addicting gameplay,"Let me begin saying I got this for my twin sons to get them interested in medicine (I am a MD). Well this game is not realistic, but it is fun and addicting. I have found myself coming home from practicing real medicine to practice the fake one! The dialogues can be boring but they can be skipped. I have a blast playing it and I return to previous surgeries to improve my score. I highly recomend it but I would suggest that you rent it first since some folks do not like. We do not all share the same likes!"
5,addicting,this game is so fun i never want to stop playing it.keeps you interested with the many challenges and the unique characteristics of the game. Would recomend this to anyone who enjoys quick thinking games.only problem i have is that there is a lot of subtitle conversations that you cannot skip and are very cheesy and boring but it doesnt take away from the game.
3,Interesting Game...,This game it is indeed interesting.The dialogue gets old and I usually skip as much as possible but when you are in the actual operations you find yourself involved and trying over and over to figure out the what steps need to be taken and which order to do them in...in a timely manner.Not the best games ever but if you have extra money it is worth giving it a chance simply for the operation procedures.
2,Understanding Research Methods: Overview of the essentials,"I was looking for a methods book for a research methods course I teach for master's level students. The text is easy to read and does get down to the point. Most of the appropriate topics are covered and the author includes nice little tricks to help students remember the material (eg. NOIR - No Oil in Rivers for scale of measurement). Although the table of contents from the publisher sounded promising, the book falls short for my needs. I found the main problem to be that the essentials of research are distilled down far too much, lacking any depth. Coverage for most topics consists of a single page. Thus, I found the book to be a disappointment and would hesitate to use it even with undergraduates. However, if you are looking for a bare bones-distilled notes kind of text you might consider the book."
2,The Ladies of Garrison Gardens,"This is an intriguing story that has, in my opinion a pathetic, weak, frustrating ending. This story sucked me in emotionally and then left me wishing that I had not wasted my time reading it.Mrs. Rain's story is told throughout the Novel and then her story at the end dies without any resolution...very, very sad and pointless to have such an interesting story end so badly."
4,Worth the Read,I loved the way the characters had flaws along with all their good qualities. A good read. Couldn't put it down.
3,"A little disappointing, but anything Sonny is great!","I guess I was expecting the Sonny James of the 1950s, but was sadly disappointed, but I still enjoyed listening to Sonny. I'm trying to find the following albums by SJ, ""HONEY"", ""SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN"", AND ""SONNY"" and I would appreciate hearing from any fans of Sonny James, Faron Young, Carl Smith, Hank Snow, and George Morgan."
4,Sonny has always been the COUNTRY GENTLEMAN,"I was fortunate to know Sonny when he was living in Dallas in the 1950's. He was recording for CAPITOL and doing a weekly show on the WFAA Shindig. He could sing and play with the best in country music, and I am pleased to hear in this album some of the same style and musicianship that made him famous. His fans always thought of him as the COUNTRY GENTLEMAN because he was just as gracious onstage as offstage."
5,Very good!,"Yes, I'm going to defend this album. I absolutely love it as it shows Sonny up dating his sound. Love it! I own all of Sonny'sLP's and put them all on homemade CD. The quality on all these is unbelievable! I hope Bear will put out another set of Sonny's works. He's the best! I am 28 and love Sonny."
4,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,Great but not one of his best .It dones not compare with SNOW IS ON THE ROSES .Had tape but wore it out .Had try to fine it but can not .I would be so happy if I could a copy . IT would make my day
3,Great for people who long for more music from Sonny.,"As a Sonny James fan I was ecastatic to find Sony music had put this out. It's a collection of songs recorded in 1979 for the Monument label, but was never released because Monument went belly-up. Although the great James voice of the 60's and early 70's is gone, you still have some new music to enjoy. Several have a latin beat and I think are the best..including ""Pledge of Love"" which has the famous Sonny James ""lilt,"" and ""Kid Cisco,"" a nice peppy song. Every Sonny James fan was probably disappointed by ""Lorelei"" which was so pretty and had some unique voice twists...then it breaks into the marching band sound! I'd like to hear from other Sonny James fans."
2,what a rip off,I originally had wanted just the board game until i saw the offer for 2. I should have stuck with the original plan. the additional game was a piece of junk and a waste of money!
3,Not that bad... but,"This dictionary is a basic one, useful for a beginner german lerner. It has many words, and presents the pronunciation of the words as well. However, there are some pages missing for the letters S and R, which is dissapointing."
3,An Interesting Way to Give Cash,"I bought three of these before the holidays to hold cash I was gifting to my nephews. It's a cute way to give cash or gift cards and the boys enjoyed them, but one of them apparently malfunctioned because as soon as my nephew pressed on the side of it, the drawer with the money flew open. The other two puzzles worked as advertised and engaged the boys more than if I had just put cash inside a greeting card."
3,Bitz Mini Blue Money Puzzle,Our family had fun oin Christmas gift exchanges with all the different puzzle boxes I put money gifts in. I will definitely do this again.
2,You get what you pay for,"I ordered this mount for a Sharp 20 inch LCD and it's not that great. It was very easy to install, however, the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level. Thus when the TV is pulled away from the wall, the set is not level and very annoying to look at. I don't believe this is a fault in the actual part, but the design of the arm. This was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount - and you get what you pay for."
1,no rebate,"I bought this Mustang mount for $[...] in 2006. There was a rebate offer at that time with a combination of purchase of certain Samsung TV and this Mustang mount. I purchased the required TV as well. I printed out a rebate form off Amazon.com and followed the all procedures required. I never received a rebate check. I contacted Amazon a couple of times to resolve the issue. However, they were not helpful at all. I was so disappointed in Amazon.com regarding the way they handle these faux rebate offers."
3,Not specially a Romance Novel,I wouldn't read this book if I really wanted to read a romance novel. The story is nice but full of tragedy and too much description of everything. It's not a light reading kind. It left me with a heavy head. To get to the real romance part you got to reach till the 3rd part of the book.
5,This is way over due....,"Finally someone has woken up and has seen the light by putting the original 60's and 70's Scooby Doo Where Are You in a box set. Sure, we all bought the Original Mysteries, The Creepiest Capers, and the Spookiest Tales dvds, and also the vhs tapes, but most of the episodes have been hashed out, recycled and put on vhs and dvd over and over again, without new episodes being released. I like many of you am tired of this process. By releasing this box set of the complete first and second seasons, hopefully this will make up for all those episodes that have been released over and over again to us. I went ahead and preordered this, cant wait to get it. Now I can either sale my copies of my other Scooby dvd's or give them away to any kid who needs to know what Saturday mornings were all about back then. Scooby Doo Where Are You is a classic, and this box set hopefully is s sighn of better things to come...."
5,Great family show,I loved the original Scooby-Doo as a kid and this DVD collection has all of my favorites. I shared it with my 8 and 10 year old neighbors and they loved it. This is truly a timeless classic and anyone between the ages of 6 and 50 will love watching this show.
5,Brings back memories!!!,I bought this set of DVD's for my daughter who is a huge Scooby-Doo fan. She was so excited to see some of the villains from her Scooby video games in actual episodes. It also took my husband and me back to the days when we were just kids. This set gives you your money's worth of episodes and I believe it is worth every cent.
4,Scooby Dooby Doo!!,"I bought this as a gift for my buddy's daughter Brooke who turned 5 years old last month, & was so happy when she opened it that she give my wife & I a huge hug & plenty of kisses!! She loved it so much that she went right to her room & started watching all 4 dvd's with her brother Tyler!! They even wanted me to watch it with them that i even loved watching all those classic episode's from back in the day!! If you're a fan of classic Scooby, this was no doubt the dvd box set to own!!"
4,classic scooby,"Not much bonus material, but the entire 1969-70 1st 2 seasons are pretty cool, and my 5-year-old can't get enough of it! Good value for a box set too."
4,Kids love the video,My 2 youngest children have developed a love for Scooby Doo. I purchased this video because it was reasonably priced and it was worth the money.
2,ORIGINAL SCOOBY DOO TV SHOW,"REMEMBERED GETTING UP EARLY ON SAT MORNINGS TO WATCH THIS SHOW. IT WAS GOOD THEN, BUT JUST DOESN'T SEEM THE SAME. MAYBE GOOD FOR LITTLE KIDS. I WOULD RENT FIRST TO SEE IF YOU REALLY LIKE IT AS MUCH AS YOU USED TO"
2,Same plot every episode but my 6-year-old daughter loves Scooby-Doo!,I watched Scooby-Doo growing up but never really cared for it...but my 6-year-old daughter loves it. It's the same plot every episode. We have a few Looney Tunes discs that I think she got tired of watching....right now she picks Scooby-Doo over Bugs Bunny.
1,Probably the worst cartoon that has ever been created.,"I've been an admirer of most of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but 'Scooby Doo' is one whose sucess seems a real mystery to me.The plot of every single episodes is just exactly the same. The gang is working on solving a mystery of a lost treasure supossedely taken away by a monster, ghost, or any other creepy character. In the end the find out that such creature doesn't exist and it's a person in disguise trying to steal the treasure. Frankly I don't understand what is so good about this crappy show.If you wanna see Hanna Barbera at their highest level of creativity, get 'The Flintstones' boxed set, because by watching one episode of Scooby Doo, you might as well have seen them all."
1,Most overrated carton in history,"This is the most over-appriciated cartoon in history. Why a show featuring no-dimensional characters and atrocious writing is still haunting serious animation fans 30 years later is beyond me. Thanks for wasting our time, Warner Bros. Where's our Batman: The Animated Series DVD box set?"
5,love it,"love the old scooby doo movies but i noticed that some are missing and that is disappointing. hopefully they make another set,"
5,Another Winning Box Set From WBs!,"My daughter is 3 1/2 years old and is a Scooby Doo fanatic. I ordered this box set for her and she absolutely loves it! It's the first DVD she wants to play in the morning and the last one she wants to see before she goes to bed. The cartoons are pretty short so you get a lot of episodes on each disk. And the story lines are not too scary for the younger ones. If you like watching the original Scooby Doo series on TV, you must get this set. It's a great one!"
5,Scooby Must Have!!!,"This set is great! ""Where are you!"" is one of the shows that really stands up to the test of time. It has good messages about teamwork, intelligence and pragmatism mixed with the bad shortcuts and lots of snacks that make it great. It has become one of my small child's favorite cartoons."
4,5 year old loves it,"My son loves it. Nice mix, of music, monsters, and silly behavior, to keep a child interested."
5,perfect!,"perfect set for any fan of the cartoon. Arguably the best of scooby doo. Please release ""The Scooby Doo Show"" next!"
4,"Great collection, but special features are lacking","I was a kid who grew up in the mid-70s and loved many of the cartoons of the time (as well as those of the 60s). I was very happy to see them put out the first 2 seasons of Scooby Doo on DVD. These are, in my opinion, the best of the Scooby Doo cartoons. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do like the Scooby Doo Movies, as well as the Scooby Doo Show. I thought Scooby Doo went downhill after Scrappy Doo was added. I also like the new shows - What's New Scooby Doo and some of the movies like Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island.Back to this set - the quality of the DVDs (picture and sound) is very good, a definite improvement over some of the earlier compilations such as Spookiest Tales and Creepiest Capers. My only qualm is the lack of special features. I would have liked some interviews with the great voice talent on the show, as well as some history (where the idea originated, etc.) I would definitely recommend this set to other Scooby Doo fans."
2,dvd Scooby,no spanish translation... It is ok with the subtitles but I am used to watch this tv serie in spanish version since I was a child... I am used to the spanish voices.
2,flawed product,"big scooby doo fan, love all these episodes but one of the discs in the pack that i got was flawed and wont play on most dvd players, looks like it was burned wrong or something."
5,"wow, excellent","I grew up watching the old scooby doo cartoons, and well I could not have asked for a more satisfying set of them. None of the cheezy spin offs that in my opinion ruined the series. No scrappy doo, no guest apperances by people that I dont care to see on TV so why would I want to see them in cartoon form.Just simply great, a classic that will always stay in my collection!"
5,Scooby is a trip,I never get tired of this show.I dig how scooby relates to a Problem.scooby is always about a full Belly&having fun.to cool for words.Shaggy cracks me as does the rest of the gang.Scooby Doo is a show that I got into right off the Bat.timeless Entertainment.
5,"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? Season 1 and Season 2",Scooby-Doo is a great show on Cartoonnetwork and Boomerang. It is great that they put it on DVD. My favorite episode is Nowhere To Hyde. One good thing about this DVD is that it has all the Scooby-Doo episodes. The bad thing is that it costs too much!!! Please lower the price!!!!!!
5,Great!,I grew up watching Scooby in the early 1970s. Now I watch these 1969-1970 cartoons with my children. We love them. Scooby stands the test of time!
5,Awesome!,"These are Great! Bought these for my daughter's boyfriend who's 19, and he loves watching the old cartoons. They need to go back to these kind of cartoons! 12/2010"
5,Love it!,"My husband and I are huge Scooby-Doo fans, so it was great to be able to buy the complete first and second seasons on one DVD. My 3-year-old son just loves the DVDs and watches at least one episode a day. I love being able to share part of my childhood experiences with him. He also loves the Tom and Jerry DVDs. Unfortunately they don't make cartoons like this anymore. I would definitely recommend Scooby-Doo - the First and Second Seasons."
5,the classic best,"ahhhhh! the 70's, great weren't they? watching all these classic episodes with my son brought me back to the day when us kids would wake up early to watch scooby doo on saturday morning. From start to finish you'll be transported back to the good ol' days when cartoons were real cartoons. I found it hard not to watch another episode of the teenage sleuths in action. I highly recommend these dvd's to any fan of the series, even the fans of the what's new scooby doo series, all the classic episodes from the first and second seasons are a pleasure to watch. Enjoy!!!"
3,Do you like Scooby Doo? Then get this,"Well, if you enjoy scooby doo cartoons, youll love this. It's everything, and nicely placed together. Not much else to say other than it is exactly what it says it is."
5,Scooby-Dooby Doo,My son is Scooby Doo crazy so we got this for him as a gift. It came very quickly in very good condition. I would absolutely do business with them again.
5,Doesn't get any better than Scooby!!,"I've loved Scooby and the gang since I was a child (now 38 :)), I still love Scooby and I have a 3 yr old that has loved him since he could say Scooby, so it was a must have in the collection. Now to get the Scooby Doo cartoon movies. I think our collection would either be or close to being complete. A must have for any Scooby lover."
4,Good family fun,Hours of Scooby makes these DVDs good value - they're fun to watch for kids and adults.
5,Great!!!!!,"My 6 yo and 2 yo LOVE it! And, as a child of the 70's, I get a nostalgic kick out of it too!!!Highly recommend!"
3,Reasonable if you're not a pro,"While 133x is ok, go for the 300 if you're shooting sports or are in need of serious fps for whatever reason. For ""prosumer"" bodies (Nikon D300, Canon 30/40/50D, etc), this should be ok.I just picked up some 8GB 300's for less than $100 each. The 133 is going for about $58. It's just a matter of cost and what you really need, as opposed to what you think you want. I do need to have the faster speed shooting 10fps, but on my other bodies the 133's I have work great."
4,Very interesting look at modern LGBT history,"A short and quick read, it gives a good perspective on the progress of LGBT acceptance in the US. The essay in itself is very interesting, and reading the additional comments and stories adds a lot. Being gay, I'm versed in LGBT history but this book was still worth the while. I'd definitely recommend anyone to read this to get an insight. Much better thanThe Cross in the Closet, a book with similar aspirations that I read just after this."
4,"Savage's forward no good, historical essay interesting","Dan Savage's long forward did not sufficiently contextualize the historical essay that follows.He only covered one point, simply that gays are not usually insinuated as being child molesters today, as once was a false and negative stereotype. His point is ""It gets better."" Merle Miller deserves credit for coming out in print in an era when no one was doing this. However, by today's standards, the essay demonstrates that Miler did not understand the origin of his own homosexuality, but nonetheless did not want society to punish him or to denigrate him for it. The essay seems more like an emotional outburst than a well-thought out piece. Again, given the times and the lack of resources available to Miller in his lifetime concerning homosexuality, the essay is ok. The best writing in this slim volume is the afterward by Charles Kaiser."
2,Hard to get into.,"I wish I enjoyed the book as much as the other reviewers, but I just can't get into it. I've wanted to put it back on the shelf numerous times, but the high marks given to it keeps me going, waiting for it to get interesting. I don't think the story is going to grab me like it did the other readers. I've read to page 77 and I think I'm going to give it up."
3,nice looking but not useful,"I really like the design of the Crumpler 4 million dollar home, and the color, so when I got my 400D, I decided to get one.When I got the bag I found disappointed that it's can only barely fit my 400D+ 17-85 lens. Although a divider comes with the bag, it so weak to hold the camera straight, so the camera falls aside easily.It's a bit crowded, although there is a possibility to fit in another short lens, but it will be difficult to get them out of the bag.Once the camera fit into the bag, it need some efforts to pull it out when you need it, so not very ideal for someone need to access the camera very fast.Overall, it has a very nice look, but I don't think it suit my needs. Also tried the 5 million but it's way too big for a slim girl like me."
3,It's pretty good,"Love the illustrations, but watch who you buy this book from. I bought this book used and the package was partially open when I received it. Also the book is bent, literally it is curved slightly. Good book, just buy new."
1,Hunt To Kill. As opposed to what? Hunt to WOUND?!,"Straight-to-DVD always equals quality entertainment. NOT!!! It was exactly like First Blood only without the good parts. And without decent acting. And without a script. And without Rambo. Okay, I lied. It wasn't ANYTHING like First Blood. I watched it for free on a movie channel and I STILL want my money back. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Eric Roberts' character dies within the first five minutes making him the luckiest actor in this ""movie""."
1,The dumb meats even dumber,"Hey, if your looking for a stupid movie, guess what ? YOU FOUND IT. From bad acting to a really stupid script. Its like a train wreck, you just keep watching, you think it cant get any worse, THEN IT DOES, WOW, Ive seen better floating in the toilet. They should pay us for the torment of watching this crap. DON'T BUY THIS ONE !!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY, The Only good part of this move, is the fact you can change the chanal, unless you bought it."
2,Only if there is nothing elst to watch,"Typical straight to DVD film fare. If you are bored and there is nothing else, then go for it ,as long as you don't have to pay for it."
5,Hunt To Kill,Am a Steve Austin fan and thus far enjoyed each movie he has appeared in. Gave this movie great rating based on storyline and genuine acting that makes sense. Recommend his movies to any who have followed Austin's career. He is the real deal.
1,Stay away!,Legs were broken within 1 year of use - first they became shaky. It was impossible to fix. The same problem happend to 3 out of 4 chairs from the same collection. Stay away!
1,8 out of the first 12 were bad,"The package arrived in good physical condition. It appears to have been well packaged. Since we ordered 4 dozen of these, we decided to try a few. Eight out of the first twelve were dead on arrival! We have a few lights for which the compact fluorescent bulbs simply will not work. We were hoping to stock up for a while. Now it looks pretty grim. We'll keep the grocery stores' shelves cleaned out, but we will test everything we buy and not just put it up on a shelf thinking that because it appears to be okay it will work."
5,Stocking up on light bulbs,"Since the government has outlawed the bulbs I need, I am stocking up a little.These came promptly, were well packed."
2,"25% DOA, cheaper at walmart","These bulbs were basically thrown in a box with only a cushion to keep the box of bulbs from banging around inside of the box, but the bulbs themselves are very fragile and I was disappointed to find 6/24 were dead in the box, left on the front porch by UPS. At that price buying an eight pack from walmart or target for $5 doesn't seem all that bad since you carry them yourself and can take them back if they are bad, and who really needs 24 bulbs these days?"
2,Some of the bulbs burnt out within 2 days!,"They're not too bright or too dull, but they don't seem to last very long before the burn out. I count myself as disappointed. I think that tells you what you need to know."
3,"Amazon sent 75w, not 60w that I ordered",I eagerly unwapped the box and was dismayed to find 75 watt bulbs. I had ordered 60 watt bulbs. But I checked the fixture and it said up to 100 watts was OK. I chose to keep the 75 watt bulbs because they offer more brightness. (They are on a dimmer in the kitchen.)
1,Incredibly shoddy bulbs,"Pros: They work, they are bright, and they do not overheat.Cons: They burn out very easily. I put three in a standing lamp, I picked up the lamp and set it down a foot back and one went out.They break if they shake too hard. I've already replaced 2."
5,Cartridges are great!,"Have an older HP printer and refilling only worked so many times. Cannot find cartridges anywhere in stores. These are great, work well and are just what I needed.Thank you."
1,this book is an insult to the work of christ.,is this for real. i bought this book because i couldn't believe it was serious. and it is! calling soul winning easy degrades the great true sacrifice of christ's death on the cross. dr. lovett treats the charge of christian witness as if it were a used-car sale. i am insulted and embarrassed by this book and by the obvious interest in it that has kept it in print for so many years.
4,hoof boots require persistance,"The Easycare Boas are my first experience with hoof boots since my horse has gone shoeless since 8/10. Overall, I love how easy they are to put on, take off etc. They stay on in any gait and used along with the gaiters, have not rubbed excessively.I have, however, had to change both of the front cables since one frayed badly and one broke during a ride; thankfully not too far from the barn. The cables are not terribly difficult to change but doubtful it can be done on the trail. Small amounts of grit can slow down the process tremendously. I would recommend carrying a spare boot instead of depending on changing a cable. Make sure you order spare laces right away after purchasing the boots."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is another of the big Alex Ross showcasts, but this time, rather than just highlighting or spotlighting one of the heroes, they have gone for the whole team approach, and thrown the Justice League in there. If you like Alex Ross and the hwole oversized artwork thing, then no reason you won't like this one, either."
5,book for teachers,I think this is an excellent resource. It gives biblical principles for effective classroom management.
5,Fascinating book puts context in to my education,"I am a fan of Henri Pirenne and his style. He says what he thinks and works to support it. This book is no different. He takes an economic view of Flanders in the mid-ages and discusses the development of trade and the need that came from it for a new system to deal with new issues. Here, in Locke's terms is probably a State of Nature and men contract to give certain rights in return for others. He then discusses the evolution of government and law over the next centuries as well as the misuse of democracy by the interest groups involved. In reading it I could not help but think of authors I read such as Locke, Smith and Marx and saw this as an historical context that helps explain some of their thoughts. I recommend this book."
4,Not 5 stars because is too short!!!,"The interaction between the (limited) vocal samples of William Burroughs treated by Gus Van Sant was so pleasant to hear that I was almost pissed off he made just four tracks!!!The music is pleasant, the voice is sampled and edited, and the whole record sounds like a diverteissement, yet, it's damn cool and fits perfectly the words Burroughs was saying... I would convince Gus Van Sant to go back inside a studio and doing a full lenght with new samples...The production and the music is clearly from the mid-80s but it doesn't sound ""cheesy"" nor badly produced, I truly adored this little record!!! A must have if you like Burroughs inside music territories as ""dead City radio"" or ""Spare Ass Annie"""
4,I love history books,"I saw this book sitting on my grand-daughter's end table and read some of it. I found it very interesting, easy to read and with colorful history information about Abraham Lincoln, the man. She had it checked out of her local elementary school library. When I returned home I wanted to finish reading it. I have really enjoyed reading it and will add it to my Research Library at home for future reference."
4,Dinner Is Served!,"With this wonderful compilation of some of America's finest African American authors - you can't lose. This is a great mix of humerous, mysterious and romantic short stories that will have you wanting to keep reading. Whatever your literary flavor....Gumbo serves it up."
4,Good dictionary,"I don't think you can judge a dictionary by not being able to find one word. What is more important is the number of definitions and examples given per reference.Langenscheidt's standard is a very good dictionary for the price. I think it works well as an ""all purpose"" dictionary. Certainly not as comprehensive as the Larousse advanced and Collins Robert senior dictionary but a lot better than any pocket dictionary available."
4,Great Work!,"This commentary on Acts is excellent. Some of the alliteration either seems to go overboard or doesn't really fit the point, but the material is really great."
5,You'll memorize this quickly!,"A female and male bear explore a variety of things they can be besides being parents. Delightfully rhyming the book affirms abilities of girls and boys. This was a favorite of my children.(This review was previously published in ""Daughters of Sarah"" Nov/Dec 1986.)"
3,Shortened version,"I love this story and have it in the hardcover version. I recently purchased it for a friend that was having twins (thought it would be appropriate!), while I was reading it with my 3 year old granddaughter she noticed that some of the pages were missing from the original version. I just think that it should be noted in the description that this book is a condensed version. It makes a person feel cheated."
2,Outdated view of women's rights for kids today,"Depending on the society you live in, the ""she can do anything he can"" view seemed outdated to me. By saying that ""she"" can do the obvious, it implies that there is a reason to have to say it. By saying isn't it wonderfull that ""she"" can do these too, it implies that ""normally"" maybe she shouldn't be able to, or why make a big deal about it. I think children should learn about ""shes"" having to make a big deal about it, but I don't want to make a big deal about my ""she"" children doing ""certain"" things or my ""he"" children doing ""certain"" things. I want them to grow up not thinking it's worth making a big deal about whether a ""she"" does construction work, or a ""he"" sews. This potentially could cast doubts in the minds of ""nontraditional"" ""hes"" and ""shes"". Frankly, my kids were quite confused by this emphasis on ""he"" and ""she"", instead of just ""people do these things""."
5,Feels like more power and better mileage,"Perfect fit in my car, replaced the OEM filter snugly. I have not measured the difference in actual horsepower, however it feels peppier and revs more quickly. I have seen about 3-4 mpg improvement in highway mileage."
3,School reading,"I had to read this for class and its not at all the most riveting read but the writing is gorgeous but if you're looking for plot or a traditional conclusion or message don't read this. In the entire novel, nothing happens, and that's the plot."
3,desperate characters enigma,"Although I was engaged throughout, I don't understand how this tidy novel has produced such an enormous fan base. It reads exactly like a typical New Yorker story, with equivocations, unanswered questions and the sense that the author forgot to add an ending. I enjoyed it but it wouldn't have found a publisher today!"
3,not desperate enough,"this book kept my interest enough to finish reading it, but it was so dry. thecharacters were self centered and whiny. i appreciated the contrast of the neighborhoodthey lived in. i'm familiar with brooklyn and manhattan gentrification. it broughtback some memories. there should've been a little more story to this novella. it waslike taking a quick walk, or peeking into someone's window to see how they live, butnot learning enough or getting satisfaction from the process. actually, the one vital,exciting character was the cat."
4,Gem of a Novella,This is a little gem of a novella. It centers around a bourgeois woman who gets bitten by a stray cat. She views the cat bite as a betrayal of her naturalistic and altruistic beliefs about how strays should respond to kindness.The shallow veneers of characters and their stereotypical professional and upper class lifestyles are juxtaposed with the reality of what is common to all of us - - the ordinary emotions and concerns shared by all of us.
1,Hardly a masterpiece....,"A middle-aged woman is bitten by a cat, which serves as a metaphor for the wild chaotic world that surrounds her. Her world, her life, her marriage, is out of control. If Jonathan Franzen hadn't lobbied on behalf of this book, we never would have heard of it, and no one would have been worse off."
3,"OK, but nothing to be overly excited about","As much as Jonathan Franzen and the New Yorker seem to be wowed by this book, I can't help but think it falls under the same category as ""The Good Soldier,"" a book that is well-written, but is taken to another level of acclaim, solely because critics and academics see so much going on in the story. I'm sorry, but this novel fails in the way that Franzen's own book ""The Corrections"" succeeds. The fine line between portraying the small happenings of life in a way that perpetuates something greater and simply portraying those small happenings is very difficult to navigate and unfortunately, Fox fails. But if you want to be a writer heralded by the New Yorker and other such literary people, then do read this and gain insight into a certain genre of literature that has been declining in recent years."
4,Not Just a Chic Book,"When I read the cover of this gift I thought I was in for a sappy ""chic book."" I was more than pleasantly surprised. Despite a slow spot in the middle when the main character goes out for a midnight stroll with her husband's soon to be exlaw partner, the book kept moving on the suspense built from a cat bite. Fox captured the moment to moment inexplicable ups and downs of even a successful marriage. Until I read this book, I thought they only happened to me! I strongly recommend this book."
2,"A novel for ""intellectuals.""","This book has some very good sentences in it, but that's about it. There is no story, and no characters. These two -- Sophie and Otto -- are humorless, pretentious people living in a gentrified section of Brooklyn and who do nothing but gripe about the ""conditions"" of the neighborhood. A homeless person actually urinates across the street! Isn't that just shocking! The whole incident with the cat bite I thought completely contrived and not credible for a second. The tone here, too, seems off: is this some kind of satire? If so, what's being satirized? It's not over-the-top nor humorous enough to justify satire. Is it supposed to be an earnest drama then? Then please, give us some characters who actually have conflict -- the stuff of drama.It astounds me how many people rave about this book. Sophie and Otto are just insipid and dull, as is the story."
2,Nice Book,This book was interesting. This book contains content intended for a mature Adults. One might be offended by such content or are under the legal age 18
5,Get Lost!,"I have spent thirty years hiking the woods of North Carolina, and never found a North Carolina guide of this significance. The writing is stellar, the layout straightforward and clear, and most important, I haven't been lost once since I began to use it. In addition to a wonderful guide to North Carolina preserves, it also underscores the magnificent work of The North Carolina Chapter during its enviable 25 year history in the state. Bravo!!"
4,"Good, could have been better","Well what more can I say....its Lizz Borden, One of the coolest old school metal bands that the 80's could offer, now with their 2000 come back I welcome them but I have to say, The tunes are cool, but it aint no old Lizzy. This is a good album but if you wanna hear some sweet Lizzy buy Visual Lies. Visual Lies has like one of the coolest songs of all time on it. ME AGAISNT THE WORLD! check it out on amazon.com and listen to a few sound samples before you decide to buy any Lizzy cause it has a aquired taste."
5,A very under-rated singer,"Been trying to purchase a Chris Andrews CD for quite a while. Swinging Sixties Hit Man is a double CD, and was a bonus as I had been trying to buy a 20 song Greatest Hits CD. Apart from his few hits, I had not heard anything else before. Wow!!, was I surprised. Except for the foriegn language tracks everything else is between excellent and very good. Too many songs to individualise so if you want a Chris Andrew CD for the collection, this is the one. Maybe a bit pricey, but with a very good booklet is worth the money. The only fault is that the whole package is from Germany (where he had most of his success) and therefore is light on chart facts and where the album tracks came from. But this is nit-picking and if you just enjoy this type of music, then this is for you. A 5 star effort."
2,Too easy and a bit boring.,"I have played a number of tycoon games, however this one just did not cut it for me. I like playing freemode, or as it is called in Vegas Tycoon sandbox. For my taste it is just too easy. All you have to do is build a large hotel and you are already making $3,000 a day. You do not get to customize the inside of your hotel, just the casinos, that is if you build one. And as I noticed the people do not really care about how nice your lot looks or how well the casino is layed out, they go in there anyway and spend the money. After you are making $90,000 a day after your 14th day there really is nothing more to build or to do. Very boring game."
2,Vegas Tycoon,"This game is definitely not what I expected. This game is so much harder than I had initially anticipated. I tried this game out, and there's so much stuff you need to do in order to make your town a success. You need to build a bunch of buildings in order for ONE hotel to get good ratings and stuff. The other disappointment is: when you build a casino, you have to put one machine/table at a time. You can't put multiple machines/tables at once, and it gets really frustrating. Not only that, but you have to change the bet settings on each machine, and it takes too long, so I gave up. I dont think this game is worth it, so save your money and buy something else that isnt so frustrating."
3,Vegas Tycoon Review,"This is a great game. The graphics are great and it is fun for all ages. There a few things that could be improved such as the ""Explore Your Lot"" mode and the casio building mode but all and all the game is overall very good. However, this game is WAY TO HARD. I can never get anyone to visit my lots even though they have casios, hotels, and many other things like places to shop and restaurants. The most I have ever had is 150 people while most neighboring lots have 800+ people. Anyway, a very challenging game."
2,Disappointing,"I guess I'm just used to more ""building"" in the sim games. The only thing you can customize is the casino. Everything else comes predone and you can't customize anything else. It's really kind of boring after you get everything done. It's definitely not a game that can hold my attention for long."
3,OK for b-side,"OK, another expensive import single from Erasure. So is it worth your ten bucks? Well, you get the single version and an ambient mix by Thomas Fehlmann, which are all well and good but I prefer the album version from their self titled album. Chertsey Endlos is a cheery if a bit minimalist synth ditty that lasts for about 6 minutes and the first half is sans vocals (the second half has one phrase repeated over and over). Then you get a live and *unplugged* version of Sono Luminius... but I'm not into Erasure because I like it unplugged! (As Andy Bell said, ""We can't do it without a computer!"") So there you have it, the b-side is alright, but it isn't much value to find one okay song on a ten dollar import."
2,Reality Strikes Again,"This book is real. It was released in 1940. It was also made into a Paramount movie in 1941 called ""Bahama Passage"" staring Sterling Hayden.Is it worth forty dollars? I don't think so."
3,Not the Reference for which I was looking,"This book is a hodge podge of thrown together design and development techniques. A sprinkling of Deming, a spoon of Drucker and a heap of ""personal interviews"".What is missing is a complete, well thought-out and useful methodology. This book was not without some good information, but it just wasn't enough nor was it well organized enough for me to recommend as a reference."
2,Not too focussed on documents,The start of the book is very promising with lots of tips and tricks in the creation of a specific document strategy. But the last half of the book becomes regular projectmanagement and strategy development techniques. I was expecting some more specifics within the context of defining a document communication strategy.
2,Blah!,"I have one of these for my flute. I bought this for travel poropese because I was always at school, parades, church and in and out of the airport. It is very soft and not well protected. The flute head does not fit well in it and has to be ""Shoved"" in to fit. If you have a B foot it won't fit or you have to put it on the outside pouch. THe pouch held pencils and maybe a phone, but on this product the lining does not last. Mine ripped in like a monoth. It is also way bigger than the normal flute case and sometimes in the way, it it's not a dead give away that it's a flute. The nice pretty colors usually cost 10-15 Dollars more....I wouldn't recommend it, because you will have to replace it in the near future."
5,"She Is All Aglow, Screaming In Trembello",I ordered this product as a gag gift for my girl friend. She thought it was goofy and then she wanted to try it out. She is typically loud when we get it on but now when she gets this she is screaming and wet and juicy.She loves it and it is fun for a change up every now and then. I wish she would let me make a video review for this product.
2,"Eh, maybe it's just me...","The product had an impressive vibration for it's size, and it was pretty quiet, but it wasn't able to quite reach my button when my BF wore it. Each woman is built differently though, so it may work for other women if their clitoris is close to their vagina. *shrug* In short, it didn't work for me, but it's a great concept!"
3,"Good product, but could be better","I like the rings, but I think they could make them re-usable. It's kind of annoying that you have only one chance to use it"
2,Save your money.,This set is pretty flimsy and not as good as other rings I've tried. Save your money and look elsewhere.
2,Not what I expected...,"When you look at the picture; you don't get what you see. I only received 3 of the same kind (the top pink one); which worked out fine, however I expected to get the variety. They're single use or you can wash and reuse. They came in a sealed package (all separate). Overall, I enjoyed the one I received but would have liked to see what the others had to offer."
3,"All 3 are the same, not an assortment",Individually sealed wich is a plus but after opening noticed all 3 are exactly the same. They were all the light pink (top left in pic). Super thin ring on this one kinda feels like it will snap. Just ok.
4,Fun Product,8/10 - The battery life lasts awhile and the cost is a major plus. They are definitely worth trying out if you've never used one before.
2,not so powerful,"I brought this 4 my partner and I, so we could try. I honestly did not like the product very much, it did nothing for my partner and I, the vibrationations were weak, we had to use my vibrator to get the sensation we wanted."
5,PLEASURE LIKE NEVER BEFORE!,"My vagina began dying to sensation when I started having pre-menopausal symptoms in my late 30's, and although my hubby tries to do different things to give me pleasure, they don't always workout as planned. But I ordered these just to see what they were like, and boy-oh-boy am I glad I did!I have found that the largest (thickest) ring gives the best sensation so far, and it is the tightest one for my husband which provides super-sensation for him. But ladies, let me tell you, the vibrator brings much pleasure, but that is not all. Each ring has a small ""tickler"" thingy right underneath the vibrator that sends the pleasure over the edge! It is wonderful, and will resurrect the deadest vagina - TRUST THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!!!I would recommend these to anyone looking for extra added sensation or needs a genital resurrection. The price is a bonus!"
5,Excelente,"Excelente producto, muy recomendable, muy buena calidad, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno."
4,Fun for a day.,"I tried to put all three on at once, didn't work so well. But once at a time seems to set things to lvl 2."
1,Batteries DO NOT LAST,"I have ordered these types on Amazon before from another seller as my wife loves em but, I decided to go with the slightly cheaper ones here and paid dearly! The first of the 3 we opened had a baterry that last literally 2 mins before it died. We decided it was a dud and moved on to the next one which lasted all of 3 mins before dying. We haven't tried the 3rd since by that time the moment was gone :(Pay the extra dollar or two and steer clear of these."
3,Good textbook for students and junior engineers,"This book is a great reading for students or junior engineers who are just starting to work in Mechanical Engineering. However, a Senior Engineer and any experienced practician will look for something more deep."
5,Great smelling and tasting coffee,"I love this coffee, and while the taste is delicious and smooth, more than anything I believe that the best thing about this coffee is the amazingly yummy aroma!! It is a caramel flavor, and the scent spreads around the kitchen. I love passing by the coffee shelf just for this reason!!"
3,Good At The Beginning,"I have been a lover of anything caramel all of my life and that's many decades. I liked this coffee at the beginning as it had a good caramel taste. However, toward the end of the fourth bag I was getting burned out on the flavor. It just got to be overwhelming day after day and I was looking for a change. I'm now buying their vanilla nut creme coffee which is good. (I would bet that mixing this caramel coffee with their vanilla nut creme would be absolutely delicious.)So, I gave this coffee three stars because it's good but you might find yourself looking for a change, too, after a while."
2,"Super-fast, but super crap!","Super fast as claimed, but noticed data errors when moving large numbers of 50+ MB files. After 2 weeks the device stopped working and was seen by all PCs as a 12x media drive with no storage capacity. It can't be formatted, erased or reset. Media was always removed using the ""safely remove"" feature in XP and 64-bit Vista RC2.Contacted manufacturer and to date they have not bothered to reply to multiple e-mails.Based on my observations, I would suggest you stay away from this unless the manufacturer were willing to stand behind it and support it."
2,Tons of errors,"Lots of questions but many errors, including incorrect answers! If it were proofread a few times, it'd be better."
4,Rugged Look/Functional,"This sheath not only looks cool, but after dropping my phone onto an aircraft carrier flight deck, I found that it completely protected the phone and absorbed the shock, no damage done. Every now and then, I'll answer my phone and a friend or even total stranger will comment on the coolness of this skin. Only drawback: It's such sticky rubber that it doesn't slide into pockets very easily. I AM thinking about buying another in a different color IF THEY EXIST! Great purchase."
4,Dated but still worth a listen,"The king of Hawaiian steel is at his best here. The arrangements with vocal chorus backrounds are dated, but the sound of the Hawaiian Islands still rides on every note of Jerry's steel guitar."
3,Great CD missing Jerry's 2 biggest hits!!!!,"Jerry Byrd came to my attention while I worked as a DJ in the 60s. Both his ""Adventures In Paradise"" and ""Memories of Maria"" were easy listening giants and both made the Billboard Hot 100.But they are not here!!!!!"
2,Read War in 2020 instead,"I thought this book was pretty bad. I suggest you read Peters's book The War in 2020 instead - it is fantastic. Flames of Heaven is also pretty good, as is Red Army."
5,Sick,"This albumn is sick from start to finish. Rarely do I love a record on the first listen - it normally takes me multiple spins, but this one just took my be the neck and made me pay attention to every second. It's brutal and creative at the same time. Everything that's been said is true, and not biased hype. Definitely one of the top 10 of the year."
2,ehhh i thought this album sucked,"Anti Hero and one other I cant remember the name were the onl two songs i liked. Just something about it didnt click for me. Go buy , Inflames, shadows fall, Unearth, 3 Inches of blood, the Haunted, Soilwork, Cradle Of filth and Immortal instead. The talents their I just felt like the production sucked and the vocals made me cringe."
2,Just OK.............. Whats the big deal,I thought Determination was much better than this. I like 2 songs. They seemed to have lost the raw sound they had. I feel the same about this as I do Devildriver. Sure it's heavy but where's the originality. Save your money!
2,Its alright,"This CD its not as good as the last one, i was expecting a better coming from GF, but i guess everybody its trying to sellout instead of caring what the fans think"
2,Got under my skin,I heard good things about these fellows and bought their cd. I was impressed that the guitar solo seems to be returning. But the simple lyrics and extremely annoying (in my opinion) vocalist allowed for me to only give it one listen. Beats the crap outta Nu-metal and new-Metallica for sure. Two stars for decent solos.
4,WTF?,"I haven't heard this cd, but the whole Aenima cd being ""way overrated"" is just plain retarded. Are you smoking crack?"
4,Excellent CD,"This is a CD that really brings a heavy feeling along the lines of Pantera that compares to Pantera better than any I have heard. Yes, Lamb of God is hailed as the next Pantera, but overall, I think that God Forbid has more of the same traits. Granted, I think Lamb of God has longer potential, but this God Forbid CD shows VAST improvement over previous efforts. From the opening notes of Force Fed, you know that this CD is gonna just destroy. And it does. Big riffs, catchy choruses, and some of the better pure metal you will hear from a recent band. Good stuff!"
1,poorly designed machine,I purchased this machine for fathers day 2008 it was just introduced by karcher. I probably used the machine 4 to 6 times for light cleaning around the house. I purchased it through Northern Tool. Upon receiving it I noticed how difficult it was to thread the hose on not much room. Now the hose will not stay on. The pressure has blown off the plastic threads. Obviously a poor design. I contacted Karcher customer service which replied that the hose would have to be replaced. At my expense. I purchased the hose replacement through pressure parts .com and was surprised that the replacement hose has all brass internal fittings not plastic and a longer handle at the hose end to ease screwing into the machine. This is my second Karcher electric washer and last one I will ever purchase. It is a poorly designed machine. I thought a huge Corporation like Karcher would stand by there product. Obviously not
1,Received Unit broken-did not use,After waiting 3-1/2 weeks I finally received my Karcher power washer. I was anxious to use the unit only to find out it was delivered with two broken parts. The shaft was broken to the on/off knob and the left side plastic housing was broken. I was extremely disappointed and returned the unit for a refund. The packaging was in good condition on the outside of the boxes. makes me wonder how the unit would hold up to normal use.
1,Caveat Emptor,"If you're considering a Karcher electric power washer, you should know that Karcher will not warranty their products unless they're purchased at an ""approved outlet."" They play this little game by talking about that requirement on their website, but fail to mention that if you buy from eBay or anyone else they consider ""not authorized,"" you get no warranty whatsoever.I'm out $200 because, as one of the people they have the nerve to call a 'customer care representative' told me, ""You should have read the warranty card that came with your product.""When asked how a consumer could accomplish that before purchase, considering the warranty card is inside the box with the washer, she was stumped for an answer. When I asked why they don't disclose on their website that they won't warranty products from unapproved retailers, more silence ensued.Very disappointing to encounter a high-profile brand with deceptive business practices."
1,Poor Online service,"I have a 1700 PSI unit with a 24-7 replacement sticker. Good luck. I called and was told to call during the week. I write this review only to advise prospective buyers of this company. My unit which is a lesser unit than this is on its fourth season, used for two seasons once and a third twice. At the end of last season it became intermittant and now will not pull soap into it. I kept stored in a garage which does not freeze in the winter. I have used it for several hours each time to wash my single story home and a couple of times to wash my car. I am very disappointed and will not buy another Karcher."
4,Pass the garlic please,"Good book. Poor Nyssa gets whomped on by the vamps, Tegan runs around like a mouth on legs, and the Doc is... well how the 5th was back in the day. Good overall story, nice little cameos here and there. DEFINITELY read Blood Harvest first."
1,Self-serving drivel,"This book is great for anyone with a thin knowledge of hip-hop culture. Boyd drops a lot of names and poses hard but doesn't leave the thoughtful reader with very much by way of hard analysis. He doesn't even really explain what his thesis is beyond solipsistically refering to a generation's hunger to ""get paid."" The fact that NYU Press published this book and sanctioned it as ""scholarly"" work is a sad commentary on how deeply the ethos of entertainment and racial posturing have permeated contemporary American life. Boyd will certainly live to regret the title of this book."
2,Disappointed,"The thesis is provocative, but that's it. The work is--with regards to scholarship--deeply impoverished. Venerable writings on Hip Hop remain few--consult Robin Kelly's or Tricia Rose's forays on the subject for more engaged, scholarly readings."
3,"Yes, even for the money paid, 3 stars.","You MUST be a huge Orton fan to even want to buy this. I'm sorry, I wanted a bit more. It's rich, informative and extensive in it's research, no doubt. I find it bare and without any illuminating facts about Orton. I've read this all before. How ever, It's a nice addition to my collection, quite bare without it in an Orton collection, really. Used mostly in a lexicon fashion."
5,"""-""",I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Daniel Richler is an exceptionally creative individual. Kicking Tomorrow is an engaging and comical story of the transition from wayward youth to adult. I look forward to reading this authors future works.
4,An underrated find,"I purchased Kicking Tomorrow out of interest in Mordecai Richler but ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would. The substance abusing teenager is over-the-top but the writing is first-rate, with a non-chronological narrative that is both readable and adds to the dramatic tension. Add to this the language politics and social issues of Montréal in the 70s and some supporting characters that have very complex personalities, and you have an engrossing reading experience."
4,Great Supplemental Thesaurus,"This book is worthless as one's ONLY thesaurus. However, I bought this title as a supplement for Roget... and in that capacity, I LOVE IT! There are times when I just can't find the perfect word to express myself in a conventional thesaurus... That's when I break out my Highly Selective Thesaurus for the Extraordinarily Literate (although I can only admit to moderate literacy) and usually find something intriguing... at least to me!Owning a book with such an audacious description of the owner in the title may (to some) appear to require an extra-large helping of egocentrism. But come on... it's meant to be funny... There's no need to get all worked up over the title!The bottom line is this: it's a good reference to have around IN ADDITION to a more meat-and-potatoes thesaurus."
1,"Wow Your Friends, Intimidate Your Enemies!","This is a really fun, really goofy collection of one-hundred-dollar words that only the most arrogant intellectual--fastuous mandarins, to you!-- would ever pull out.BUT, I bought this book in the hopes of having a useful reference, not as a party trick propellant--thus the one star rating. If you are looking for a serious, thesaurus-like aid for professional purposes, look elsewhere. If you'd like to make people feel small through your skookum vocabulary (how's that?!), then this is the book for you. And, I will admit there is fun to be had with this book, just know that's as much use as it will give you."
3,"Very useful, but take caution","This is a very useful thesaurus that definitely fills a gap left by normal thesauri. However, Ehrlich often picks words that are not really synonyms but more like particular examples or even vaguely related terms. For instance, under ""priest"" he gives, as a synonym, ""bacchante."" Sorry, but a bacchante is a female worshipper of Dionysus. I can't really think of any instances where ""bacchante"" would be a good synonym for ""priest"", even if you're speaking figuratively. Another example- under ""street,"" he gives ""cul-de-sac"" (is that really such an obscure word?). Everyone knows a cul-de-sac is a kind of street, but not a synonym for it. Ehrlich does this again and again, probably because he had difficulty finding enough real synonyms to fill up his book. As Ehrlich himself advises in the preface, if you come across a word you're not familiar with, be sure to look it up in a dictionary before you use it as a synonym."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I purchased this and another thesaurus hoping to find some creative words to use when I write. This was extremely disappointing. There are definitely some impressive words, but few that could be used even in a scholarly article or report. If you have several thesaurus reference books, this might make an interesting addition, but don't expect to use it very often."
1,disappointing,"Although this book is packed with great words...it is not a good reference book. I will be sending it back, and search until I find that one , fabulous thesaurus...."
4,Ashkenazy's 1812 with St Petersburg Philharmonic,"I heard this track on Australian Broadcasting's Breakfast with Clive show (http://www.abc.net.au/classic/breakfast/) this morning. Really loved the chorus' work with the St Petersburg Philharmonic. I tracked down the details and will send a copy to my brother who's a real classics buff. We both enjoy the 1812 (as do many people) and this is a special version.I haven't heard the rest of the CD, but I'm sure Ashkenazy has inspired the orchestra all the way through."
3,Most of us would qualify as highly literate,"A lot of the words are known by any intelligent person. A few give clarification between words that can be confused (i.e. Flaunt and flout). A handful are so highly selective, I don't know how or when they'd be used."
4,Great gift for the writer,"If you are a lover of the English language, this is a great gift for the writer you know."
2,A Book Without A Purpose,"This ""dictionary"" is so ""highly selective"" that it is not all that useful as a reference. If you encounter a word you want to look up, your chance of finding it in this dictionary is near zero.It should be more appropriately named as a collection of certain less frequently used words. If you read this book from cover to cover, you will probably find that you know many of the words already and, of the ones you don't know, you may retain a few of them.Well, I am probably not ""extraordinarily literate."""
3,You dont have to be that literate,"I already knew most of the words, which weren't that interesting or useful anyway. It isn't a bad book but not my favorite of the genre."
1,Offended at these books,"I was searching some new dictionaries and adjective books to increase and better my vocab. but was very disappointed at his books. Bought 2, the Golden Adjectives and the Dictionary. The majority of words in ea book are either on the negative side, or offensive words with sexual conotations. I wanted to better my vocab not bring it down."
3,cheap drill bit set,"Good cheap drill bit set, nothing that is going to last all that long especially the smaller bits but well worth the money."
3,It is ok,"It does its job, but is very annoying that after just a couple of weeks, a lot of the bits are heavily rusted."
5,Natural Born Charmer,This was the best of her books so far. I laughed out loud and had tears in my eyes on several occassions.
3,"I love you Susan Elizabeth, but...","I am a faithful fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips, and have read every novel published by her. That said, I did enjoy ""Natural Born Charmer"", but when compared to other novels earlier in her career (i.e. ""Dream a Little Dream"", etc.) I found it lacking a little spice. The characters were very likable. However, I felt the romantic tension, and love scenes could have been stronger, and the series of events that led to the two protagonists' extensive time together, more realistic. In addition, the side characters' story was quite predictable, and I would've liked to see more development in the relationship between to the two main characters. I would still buy any book written by SEP, don't get me wrong, but this one is not at the top of the list as far as favorites."
5,Perfect!,"I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips and yet I was surprised by how good this book was. It may be her best yet. I bought it yesterday and began to read it and found that I could not put it down until it was finished. A funny, charming and heartwarming story! This is exactly what every fun novel should be."
1,Sorry,I thought the heroine of this book was one of the most unappealing characters I have ever read. The beginning of this book and the costume was ridiculous.
4,Nice Read,"I really enjoyed the independent character of Blue, and her interactions with Dean were amusing. Frankly, however, I thought her character was better revealed in her relationship with the town queen bee and their repartee. Some of the conclusions are a little too pat, though I did think that the author has insights into dysfunctional families and abandonment issues. This book is a good way to while away an afternoon."
3,A Little Charmed,"I usually like SEP books. They make me smile. Most of the characters in this book were flawed but redemptive. I can buy that. Nita was a howl; Riley captured by heart. There was something missing tho.Dean was the prerequisite alpha male. Blue was 'different'. OK, SEP needed a really good hook. The repartee was excellent. But toward the end it got as hoaky as it could. I am glad it had a happy ending but this was so over the top.It was entertaining because I let it be. But I had to stretch my imagination quite a bit. But I have read better SEP books."
2,Natural Born Charmer,"I've read every one of Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books since I discovered, and loved, First Lady. The last few books have gotten lighter and lighter until I practically had to hold this one down to keep it from floating away. There were so many sub-plots that I never got to know any of the characters well enough to care what happened to them. The main male character was so wooden I couldn't even like him. I love a humorous novel with feisty characters, but I wish the author would put a little more depth back into her plots."
2,Magic seems to be gone,"The first book I read by Susan Elizabeth Phillips was ""Dream a Little Dream"" and I was immediately hooked. I went on a one-week bender and purchased all of her prior novels and enjoyed them as well. Her last few books have been disappointing and this one is continuing that trend. The characters were not very well developed and, with the excepton of Riley, not sympathetic. The themes were fairly cliche...damsel in distress and taciturn, sex-oozing stud who by the end of the book becomes emotionally evolved. All-in-all, if you wish to read a SEP books, I would not recommend this one. I hope the next one is better."
3,Disappointing,"I loved most all of Susan Elisabeth Phillips books, particularly the Dallas Star series as you can catchup with the other characters from other books. I was looking forward to Dean's book and was left wanting.I can't put my finger on why I didn't care for it. I will probably still look forward to the next SEP book, but not buy it in hard back."
4,Natural Born Charmer,"I thought this was another great SEP story. I love all the stories from the Stars Football Team. I was a little disappointed that not alot of the previous characters from other books appeared. Still the new characters were interesting and fun. The story in itself has a simple message about change, trust, and love."
1,A Real Disappointment !!,"Too many ""Dysfunctional Characters"" What a depressing plot, everyone had so many emotional problems steming from their early backgrounds it was hard to keep score. Story lacked the usual humor and sharp quick witty dialogue I was so used to in Ms Phillips previous books. ... Too hard to find a likeable character!! (I was so glad I borrowed the book from the library & didn't waste money on it!!!)"
4,"A good read, but...","Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors. Her writing skill rises above those of almost every other author in this genre. She makes me feel like I personally know each character in her books, whether I like them or not! Her gift for dialogue and humor is unmatched. In this one, the sparring between the hero and heroine kept me laughing for most of the book. The relationship between the two, however, was not as believable as in her other books. Although there was some steam, the romance and love seemed to be lacking something. I never believed that they couldn't be without each other. He betrayed her several times in the book (I don't want to post spoilers), and those betrayals weren't resolved (to me, anyway). The ending was off - somewhat confusing - and didn't leave me feeling hopeful for the two of them, even after they were married. Overall, it was worth the read for the humor and sparring alone, it just could've been a lot more than that."
3,Liked it but didn't love it,"I really look forward to Susan Elizbeth Phillips' books but this one was a bit disappointing. It was hard to relate to the two main characters although Riley, April and Jack were much better drawn. Wish she had also included some of the people that we have come to know from previous books more than cursorily. It was a nice Saturday afternoon read but not much more."
5,One of her best,I love all her Chicago Stars books and think this is one of the funniest. The dialogue and interaction between Blue and Boo made me laugh out loud. I hated to finish it but will listen to this one on audio and recommend it to all my friends who are avid readers.thanks susan - keep writing and i'll keep reading.
2,Wait for the paperback.,"I'd like to preface this review by saying that SEP used to be one of my favorite authors. I loved Kiss an Angel, IHTBY, Heaven, Texas, Dream a Little Dream, Nobody's Baby But Mine, and Lady Be Good, but it seems that ever since she went mainstream with hardcovers, that her books have become predictable and formulaic and NBC is no exception. Beautiful and brilliant but troubled jock with too much money falls in love with a quirky, poor woman who also has family issues. For some reason, her earlier Chicago Stars books had some elements of realism, but I feel like she's lost her touch in writing relatable characters and plausible story lines. The plot was too far fetched and didn't focus enough on the two main characters. The book lacks the steam that once made SEP famous. I think the book is less of a romance and more of a mainstream family story since the subplots really took over the book.While it had some great lines and some great scenes, it's not worth the money."
4,"Good, yes, but not as good","Susan Elizabeth Phillips has set the bar very high, particularly in her Chicago Stars series, and this book, while enjoyable, does not meet the quality of some of the others. The lead characters just don't involve the heart and mind of the reader to the degree that one comes to expect from Ms. Phillips, although in comparison to most other writers' characters they stand out. The hero and heroine are not as engaging as the secondary characters, and both the beginning and the end feel lackluster and contrived. That said, the relationships between all of the characters is believably complicated and human, and as a group they are people the reader comes, however reluctantly, to care about. Definitely worth a read, but you probably won't re-read it with the appreciation of some of her best books."
5,I loved this book!,Another fun read from SEP. Very well written and funny. I was so sad to finish it.
4,realistic,"I love this book simply because it's believable, whereas it isn't your ordinary romantic book since the main character, Blue, doesn't automatically fall head over heels in love. Falling in love in this story represents what it is like to fall in love in real life: there are ""real"" problems that of which are believable.Read this book if your tired of just your everyday romantics whereas the man and woman fall in love without a problem in the world, and live happily ever after.;) Enjoy"
2,"cheap, not useful","-There is no switch, so you need to take the batteries out.-Sealed a chip bag ok.-Tried to seal a bread bag, several times, never got it to seal up all the way. It did however stink.-Tried to seal a 2mil plastic bag, barely worked.At the of about 10 passes with it, the tape part that protects the wire is falling off. The device gummed up a few other times so it had to be cleaned."
3,Moderately useful with some practice.,Tough to get a consistent seal across the entire length of the bag. Often it melts the bag completely through at the seam.
3,"cool gadget, time consuming to use","Good price, quality item, however, you have to insert the batteries every time you use this and take them out when you're not using it. There is no on/off button or switch, it's just powered by the batteries. It does heat up quickly, but I just felt as though my excitement fizzled when I put it together and used it. Overall okay, but kind of more of a hassle than a quick helper."
4,Overall pretty good,"This sealer works pretty well as a kitchen gadget. It does what it is supposed to do. It won't work with rechargeable batteries because of their lower voltage but works pretty well on alkaline batteries. There is a balance to be found between sealing speed and the pressure that you apply but it only takes a minute to figure out.Now... for those of you using this in unusual ways (like myself), this sealer doesn't do a good job at making large airtight bags. It would be perfectly fine for sealing up a bag of chips if there was a pinhole leak but if you want to make a perfectly airtight seal then you are going to have to find something else unless you are some sort of super heat sealing ninja. There are always going to be tiny leaks here and there with this device."
3,"Ok, but not for thicker foil lined bags, like coffee bags.","Just got this in, works with two AA batteries, has a switch guard so it won't normally get turned on and burned out when it's in the ""everything drawer.Pros:Works with chip bags, has a switch guard, small convenient.Cons:Won't work with thicker foil lined bags like coffee bags, or for sealing together ""pouch"" type bags for crafting (capri-sun, etc.). May work with potato chip bags, but we don't usually have them here.Overall: Great for sealing thinner bags that won't be used for awhile, like chip bags that tend to last us at least four weeks, also for sealing sandwich bags that will be used once or twice that don't have the ""zip top"" seals (which will save you money if you use bags for lunches for the school kids)."
1,itouchless is desperately disappointing,"Bought these to give as part of a house warming gift and was so disappointed and embarassed. They do not seal at all - I tried it out on chips bags, thinnner plastic bags, nacho plastic bags, pretzel bags, even bread bags it does not work on any(even tried different battery brands). Unfortunately I got them way in advance of the house warming and so by the time I found out they are useless the return date to amazon had passed. Don't be fooled as I was and if you decide to buy them then test them immediately- there may be one or two which work, though I don't hold high hopes of that."
5,Surprisingly handy tool!,"I purchased these sealers with the premise, ""if they don't work I'll just throw them away"". When I received them I placed fresh batteries in both and began to use them. The first thing is, READ THE DIRECTIONS. Unless the directions are followed you'll have problems, guaranteed.This is not a speedy sealer but it's pretty tiny and runs on two AA batteries. You'll have to practice a bit but in no time you'll be sealing like a pro. You can seal all types of bags, even the foil ones. I can seal and sized bag in about 5 seconds. You simply have to balance the heat with the speed of movement. All in all this was a wise purchase and I think you'll be very happy with this as your sealing solution."
1,Awful Product...,"This product is not worth purchasing. If it were an option, I would have given this product 0 stars. I attempted to use the product as directed but, after 30 minutes of trying to seal a bag of chips and a few battery changes and bag changes, very little of the bag was ""sealed."" And the part that was ""sealed"" was entirely too easy to reopen. I bought the product in hopes that it would help prevent a moth problem in the kitchen. Moths are resourceful and this product was no help whatsoever. My biggest regret is that I bought it as a holiday gift for the household and by the time the holiday came around, it had been past the 30 day return policy in order to get my money back."
3,It's OK,"If you're looking for this item to save you time...don't bother. If you want to reseal some bags (with practice) and then leave them for a while...this might work. I saw the reviews and realized this wasn't going to be the next great thing, but I bought them just figuring on having about $13 worth of fun. It lives up to that but it by no means a replacement for just rolling up a bag and putting a clip on it."
2,No on/off switch???,There is no on/off button at all. You have to manually remove the batteries every time you use this. It's not the easiest process and your hands have to get very close to the hot/warm sealing area. This product was hit or miss on the bags I tried to reseal. No worth the ten dollars for 2.
2,Does not seal all the way,"Unlike what was shown in the video demonstration, this re-sealer is not recommended for materials that will hold in liquids. The seal is not ""air tight"" and liquids will leak out.Tried to reseal bags holding liquid contents, and never got the seal completely closed despite multiple attempts. The fresh batteries I put in died within minutes."
3,"Great sealer, but is a little dicky.","This sealer is perfect when bag is not so thin, because, when bag is slim, sealer cuts the bag all the time, folding the bag edges several times to make bag more thick.Material that cover the little wire is just pluged with glue, so using several times is enough to the material goes out of its position. But no problem, I used ""crazy glue"", to get the material ( i dont know the real name) back to its position.Sealing first position is so difficult, beacause is the place where you grab the bag with the finger, so is necesary to start sealing from center to right, and next from center to left.I'm using rechargeable batteries, and I can use it for long time and no need to recharge."
1,Very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed with this product. No matter how I tried, I could not get ANY bag to reseal. True waste of money."
1,Not so useful,The item does seal but it also cuts the bags as it seals leaving openings. I cannot use the product and would not recommend it.
1,cheaply made,"This product works ok, not great. I had mine for a few months before it broke. Can't really reccommend it at all."
1,Not good....,Doesn't work well at all. The biggest problem is you can't seal an opened end bag all the way because you can't slide the whole bag end through the slide. I'll never use these and probably will return them.
1,"Good Idea, Bad Design","I do not recommend this product because if the batteries are IN the heating element is on, therefore if you want to turn it off you have to remove batteries. Making it unpractical & a fire hazzard."
1,iTouchless Bag Re-Sealer (2-Packs),"The product looks great but when it came to actual use, it went through batteries like crazy and did not seal fully, even when following the directions and sealing both sides of the bag. Not for sealing a large area as takes 3 seconds for 1/2 inch area of seal. I was only able to seal 2 ea, 5 gal mylar bags, per set of batteries and it took for ever! I had better results using an iron. I would only use when camping to reseal bags that have been partially used for a meal. Great idea but the technology is not there yet."
2,i touchless bag sealers,"WORKS GREAT AT FIRST THEN THE BATTERIES DRAIN,AND THEY DRAIN VERY QUICKLY YOU'LL BE FINDING YOUR SELF CHANGING THEM VERY OFTEN IF YOU USE IT AT ALL"
3,not as durable,I would have liked this item to be more durable. I did like that fact that there was a magnet but when it fell it shattered
1,Don't buy it!,"Don't buy it. Doesn't work. It is a waste of money. If you want to waste ur money, go for it."
4,Pretty good,"The DVD came super fast and the price wasn't bad either. Had some sweet moves, but some of them were just normal. Overall it was just good"
3,50/ 50,This was a great idea.But while digging out pieces some would break and the paint stuck on to the sandy plaster instead of on the pieces.But my son loved digging them out and cleaning them up.Over all we can live with super glueing on a couple of heads and repainting the pieces.My son loved painting on his own colors. He was able to personalize them.

2,Not good quality. Very disappointed.,The ink does not dry correctly. Everything smudges. This is what you get for trying to save. Save your money
1,Cartridge does not work,My HP Officejet V40 All-In-One register's this black ink cartridge as the wrong ink cartridge for the printer and therefore it will not operate with.
2,Product doesn't work,"I've had to order second party ink cartridges for quite some time now for my reliable 13 year-old HP deskjet. I installed the black ink cartridge from this set and the printer would not recognize it. This had happened before with a different vendor. I didn't bother checking out the color cartridge as I figured the best bet was to avoid any more hassle and just get a new printer, which I did. When I dumped the printer, with the new black cartridge installed, I had nothing to return, so I'm just out the $16.55. It annoys me that printer manufacturers support their products for a limited time forcing you to buy new again."
4,remanufactured cartridges,"I bought a set of these remanufactured cartridges last fall from the same company and am online to order again. the quality is just fine and the price much better than HP originals. shipping was fast. the only problem that I have had, which was noted in the packaging, is that my printer refuses to recognize them, posting ongoing messages to 'remove and check' one or the other. it takes a little persistance to work around this, but for the savings, and not reinforcing the high prices of the name brands, I find it worth it. I would prefer to use a refill kit (all in one style) but have yet to find them for the 15/78's."
5,"fast service, great product!","ordered reman-ed print cartridges for my hp psc, they work great, were very cheap, and arrived quickly (i'm always suspicious of reman-ed print cartridges as i've had bad ones in the past, but i'll definitely buy these again when the time comes...only thing i can't report on yet is how long they last as i've only had them a couple weeks)"
1,One star is only because there is no option for 0 stars...,"I regret sending my money to these thieves. I would send the ink cartridges back, but honestly it is more trouble than they are worth. Neither the color or black ink cartridges work ~~ DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE SELLERS UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY."
1,Garbage,"I ordered these cartridges for my HP 750. They printed fine, once. A few weeks later I tried to print again and they were all clogged. I had to throw them out. There's a reason these are so cheap."
5,Dont pay more save with this,"I was not sure about this but with these hard times i had to save money and try. I had no problem and i have an older HP printer, fax. It went right in and it worked and is still going strong. I will be back for more."
5,Printer ink,I needed a black and a color cartridge for my printer. These were priced right and I ordered them. The shipping was really fast I received them quicker then I thought I would. They work great it is good to have my printer up and running again.
1,I didnt like it,"The black barely worked, the color didnt work at all. But i suppose thats what i get for buying generic."
1,Unhappy,Print only 11 papers and now it won't work..really sad! now I need to buy new ink to print all my paperworks..:(
2,Not impressed,The color cartridge is working okay but the black is horrible. It is VERY washed out and I can hardly see the print. I will not purchase these again.
1,Leaky!,"The black cartidge had leaked in a air tight bag upon arrival, the color cartridge was fine. Had to return them as a set, received credit. Return was no problem."
1,Black ink is OK but color ink is not recognized by printer,Pros: The best price that I found and no problem with black ink.Cons: The color ink is not recognized by my printer (hp officejet v40xi)I don't know what I'll do since the color ink is not working...No more purchase for color inks for sure.
1,Just a waste of money,"Got the package on time. Replaced both tri-color and black remanufactured ink cartridge at the same time. After only one week of normal usage, it asked you to replace the black ink cartridge. Never buy again."
3,cartridge,Just opened my other colored ink and its empty. Very upset as I had something urgent to print and was so embarassed.
1,empty cartridge,ordered 2 - 1 had a very short life and the other registered as empty when installed. since I had stocked up I was soutside of the return policy and stuck with an empty cartridge at my cost. No contact info for OCproducts
2,Won't print,"I am not satisfied with these cartridges. For some reason, once installed, my printer would not print. I still hope it will eventually work...."
1,If I could give this 0 stars I would,"This ink didn't work properly at all...printing with black ink it was very faint and unreadable. Printing with colors were all off, I did find that changing my font color to a dark purple would make it print in a light red and be readable, but not acceptable to turn in assignments with.It could be that the ink wasn't working because it is old and for an older printer. The prices for this ink in its retail packaging is in the $65-$70 range which is I why I went with the remanufactured ink. I ended up just buying a new printer for $50, I would recommend doing the same for anyone shopping for ink for this older model printer."
3,It's worth the money,"The best thing about the cartridges is that they were about $50 cheaper than HP; the quality of the color wasn't as good as HP, but for $50 less I can live with it. The only difficulty I experienced was in alignment. The printer won't recognize that I ran the alignment page, but it prints ok so I just ignore the message on the printer that says I need to run the alignment."
3,The color printing Cartrige,This was definatly a great deal for printing cartriges. The black one works great however the color one left streaks when it was used.
1,Useless,The ink cartridge did not work. It only printed three pages and it stopped working. It was a waste of time and money
2,Defective Color Cartridge,"The black ink and color cartridges were shipped in a timely fashion - but the color cartridge was defective (my printer wouldn't recognize it). Customer service promptly shipped out a second cartridge, which was also defective (wouldn't print the color red).Third cartridge was shipped and seems to be working fine.Color cartridge quality is sketchy - but customer service is outstanding."
1,Disappointed,The color cartridge from the pair lasted for only 8 or 10 pages. Was so surprised that I assumed the printer diagnostic message system had failed.
1,Bad Cartridges,"At first glance, this appeared to be a good buy considering the cost of the original HP cartridges. I ordered 2 twin packs. After installing the first twin pack, I ran the cartridge alignment routine for my printer, and found there was no Yellow ink. I ran the prime routine. Still no Yellow. So I removed this color cartridge and installed the color cartridge from the SECOND twin pack. All seemed well. Ran same routines and everything was fine. But the day after this, the BLACK cartridge stopped working. As I had already shipped back the first twin pack for a refund, I had no other ""new"" black from my order. I was lucky I already had one new original HP black cartridge of my own which I installed, and it is working fine. I will NEVER buy this product again. There is NO bargain if the units do not work!"
3,"Item did not work, but got a refund.","Item did not work, but got a refund. It was disappointing and a lot of trouble sincve I needed the cartridge to print out christmas labels."
1,Horrible not recommended,Never buy remanufactured products. The black ink is faded when I print and the colored ink does not work at all. Definitely not recommended!
5,A treat for literature lovers,"I had several teachers throughout life that had an unparalleled ability to make knowledge seem arcane, obscure and utterly boring. Every two or three years, however, I had the privilege of being taught by a passionate teacher that had a real knack at making any subject sound enthralling.I am sure David Lodge would be one of the latter. His essays are clear, witty, funny and knowledgeable. There wasn't a single essay that did not make me want to jump to the computer, connect to Amazon.com and buy a book from the author he was writing about. And all that with plain style devoid of the ubiquitous self conscious or ranting style of most contemporary critics.A great read for literature lovers!"
4,Good for small canister filter,"I like this filter. It keeps the tank clean. It does require maintenance. You have to wash out the sponges and change the charcoal bags. Rise the charcoal bags first or your water will become gray. It wont handle large particles, so you still have to skim the bottom or use a gravel vac weekly. You must fill it completely with water to start the pump. There's a couple tricks to it, but when you get the hang of it, it's a great filter for the $$$."
3,"Does an OK job with itself, but it needs help","Very easy to prime and setup. Easy to clean and extremely quiet. Problems with this is the carbon bag, clips, instruction and picture confusion, and needing hanger. There's a lot of complaints about the bags, I took the suggestion from a fellow buyer and bought the Fluval Carbon, 100-gram Nylon Bags - 3-Pack and it cleaned the water better. The instructions do not tell you to not use the clips on the hose. Did that and they broke. Picture tell you to put the ceramic pellets in first and the carbon bag on top of that, but instructions and Zoo Med's website tells you the correct way is carbon first then pellets. Last thing, the hose isn't too long, my tank is 18.5in high and can't reach all the way on the bottom. Had to order the Zoo Med Canister Filter Hanger to compensate for the height problem."
4,"Good product, instructions need work","Proper set up of this device is crucial. I don't know why, but the company has set up the device backwards... The mechanical filtration is before the biological and chemical filtration. Every other filter system has mechanical filtration before biological and biological before chemical. If you set this up properly, it works GREAT.Also, the picture is a bit deceiving; the filter has to be at the level of the water otherwise it won't work properly. If you place it on the floor it won' t work. I will try to take pictures of mine next time I take it apart for cleaning, but for now it seems to work great.Only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not 5 is because the instructions are retarded. It was kind of a headache to set up, so much so that I almost returned it. Since I figured out how to set it up it has been working great and I am considering buying a second one instead of buying a more expensive larger filter."
2,"Great for the price, but doesnt really clean.",I have this filter with my ZooMed Turtle Tub. This is a small filter system and it barely circulate the water in the tub. It also get clogged up very easily. I would not recommend this for the Zoomed Turtle Tub. I'm most likely going have to upgrade the this filter.
5,keep my 10 gallon tank clear,i bought this for my 10gallon tank and i was amazed it kept my tank crystal clear. its quiet and compact make this item great!
2,dissappointed,"We have gone thru so many filters trying to find ones strong enough to keep our turtle's cage clean without cleaning out our wallet. This one reads as if it is specific for turtles, but it struggles to keep our 20 gallon tank clean."
3,ok,"I just got my filter for my turtle tank today. It seemes to working great. My only complaint was the instuctions for the setup of the filter. I found the instuction confusing and not easy to follow. I had to watch videos on youtube to figure out how to get my filter to start running properly. Over all how ever, the filter itself is working great now. Please update instuctions!"
3,"Good for small turtles, but not bigger ones!","I had this filter awhile back for my turtles, but they are bigger (one of them is 6-7 inches and the other is even bigger!). At first the filter worked pretty well....I can't say it was fantastic because, let's face it, turtles are way more messy than that small filter could handle!My turtles, being as large as they are, would knock it apart constantly! One swipe when they are moving around the tank and the tubes would be ripped off, making it not work right. After maybe a year, the filter died completely on me.If you have smaller turtles, and a really good set-up where they don't have any access to get near the tubing, I'm sure you will have better luck than I did.I'm now working on getting a setup with an undergravel filter and a large canister filter that cleans up to 100 gallons (my tank is 55 gallons and about 2/3 full with the basking area above). I read online that it is a fantastic setup, so we'll see!"
1,"junk, not worth anything","this filter is the biggest piece of trash i have ever used. i use it in a 20 gallon tank with 1 turtle half full of water. within 2 days i need to do a full water change. even using better carbon, it doesnt help. i am hoping to return it when my new filter arrives.i had a 25 dollar internal filter that did far better then this junk."
2,Not so convenient,"It is very hard to get this canister filter running well, no self priming and a hassle to run maintenance on. I would recommend other products because the price is not worth the work it takes to keep this filter maintained."
2,Turtle Owners Beware,"I purchased this filter several months ago and was pleased with everything. It seemed like a good deal. I have 1 Red Eared Slider and yes she is a pig. Sadly, even with several different combinations of filter media, this filter can simply not keep up. Only a few days after I completely clean the tank its already filthy. While this isn't entirely the filters fault, I just wanted to let others know to steer clear of this one if you own turtles. It runs great and would be perfect for someone with a small fish tank or something, but for turtles, it's not ready for the big time."
2,Unclear Directions,"I thought this filter would be perfect for my 2 red eared sliders because it was made for turtles. When it came i was excited to put it together but ran into a problem when i realized the directions aren't clear on whether the carbon bag goes on the bottom or top of the ceramic media, the photos on the box as well as amazon show the ceramic media on the bottom, while the directions photos show it on the top, I followed the directions photo with it on the top thinking that maybe the photographer didn't put it together correctly.... After first feeding the turtles the water became a-bit murky, it cleared up the next day to just be cloudy but its stayed that way since :("
3,Great for the price,"All in all its a great filter for the cost. Canister filters are very pricy and this one has decent performance at a great price. One of the tradeoff's though is be prepared to spend a lot of time cleaning and maintaining this filter. You can't just fill it and lock it up for 4-6 weeks and expect it to take care of business. I clean mine weekly and it performs well. However, it is very quick to get mucked up and the flow rate will drop to almost nothing and the filter will not be effective. Keep a close eye on it and clean it often, including all the tubing. Toss their stock carbon bag and use your own that is a little less full, also do not use all the ceramic rings that come with it. Overcrowding the filter will also cut way back on its flow rate."
2,eh,"not that great to be honest. it works just as well as any other filter ive had, but possibly just a pinch better. not worth the money"
4,"Works really good, minus the nasty cleaning every 2-3 weeks.","Works as expected, but I have 3 turtles, so I guess you can say that I expected the cleaning regularly. It's just nasty that's all."
2,Motor died after 3 weeks,"I had heard many great reviews for this filter, and I was looking forward to using this product, in hopes of finding a filter that would actually work! The first week or so it worked pretty great, however, by the third week, the water was BARELY trickling out AT ALL! I tried cleaning out all the tubes, but it turns out that the motor was faulty, and my turtles and fish were suffering. I am truly disappointed, and regret paying 50 dollars for this. I wish the motor wasnt attached to the canister, because then I could possibly buy a replacement motor, but now I have to replace the entire system. :( UGH! very frustrating!"
2,Flow rate is horrible!,"The flow rate on this is horrible. After a few days, the already sluggish flow rate slowed down even more to an embarrassing dribble. I'm using this on a 8 gallon tank. How can anyone put this to use? Two stars. Because it looks nice."
2,Zoo-Med has replace this unit two times in less than 6 months,"I ordered this product based on the reviews that I read on Amazon, I was quite happy at first as it looked like it kept the water clean. After a month of operation it stopped working. It wouldn't pump any water.After close inspection I found out that the impeller was broken and the motor head did not have the main pin attached to it any longer.I contacted zoo-med and they replaced both impeller and motor head free of charge.After 3 months of operation with the new one it stopped working again, one more time the impeller had broken in 3 pieces (worst than the fist time) and the pin attached to the motor head was loose.I contacted zoo med and they apologize for the inconvenience and sent me a whole new unit free of charge.I gave it two stars because of zoo-med customer service and their prompt answers to my concerns, they are all very nice and have treated me very well. This particular water filter has 1 year warranty."
2,Worst Purchase yet,"it never worked, a fluval 405 has the same system, but better ingridents, in the chemical biologcal system n the fluval, I reccomned not to get this filter, all those revjews it worked for them but will suck later, don't get it. Purchase a even stronger filter fluval 405 then this, 59.99 at petco?? 39.99 here??? waste of my dad's money whisper and aqueon, even fluval is better"
2,Not very good.,"I have a large-ish red eared slider in a tank. This filter is just not strong enough. It doesn't do a very good job of keeping the tank clean. It's extremely difficult to open, but reasonably easy to clean. Comes with dodgy instructions that are difficult to follow to put it together. Seems backwards in the way it runs. I usually have to try 5-6 times to get it to run after I clean the water - it's difficult to prime.For smaller turtles this would be a great filter, but it simply can't handle the mess from bigger turtles. Mine is about 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. I'd recommend the Magnum HOT over this. I'm currently getting rid of this filter and ordering a Rena Filstar XP3."
2,Zoo Med 501 Turtle Canister Filter,"I am not happy with this pump. It does not keep the water completely clear and the first time I cleaned it, it worked for a couple of seconds then bubbles started appearing in the intake and tube then stopped. Called the customer service four times and the person who helped me was very knowledgeable and informative said air was getting into it. It took me about eight tries before I got it to work. The next time I cleaned it, I just flushed it our from the intake side, put it together and hooked it up and the same thing happened again so I just removed it. Am using a small immersible one I had before which works much better. I got the Zoo Med to avoid having to clean the tank once a week so maybe I'll get a bigger version of the one I'm using now."
2,Only worked for a while,"I purchased this filter over a year ago, and it initially worked beautifully. It was quiet and did the job. Only downside was that when it was time to clean it... it was a real job and a half. All those little tubes and small parts, so tough to clean.After a few months, it stopped working. It wouldn't start when plugged in. When I called the company for a replacement under the warranty, they did replace it but only after a small amount of complaining on their part.Later, I ended up shelving the filter for a while, because I got tired of cleaning it. It was a small tank, so I just cleaned the tank by hand. Now, my turtles are bigger and I got them a large tank and pulled the filter out of storage.Guess what? The filter doesn't even start up. Again.Sorry Zoo Med, I can't recommend your product."
3,It was good while it lasted,"Though at first this product worked well for my needs, after about 9 months the motor powering the pump died out. I came home one day to no water flow so I disassembled the filter thinking it may be clogged but to my disappointment It had just stopped working... I gave this a three star because it was a nice filter while it lasted but is of no use to me now."
2,Works well when it works,"This product is driving me insane. I purchased it for my tree frog terrarium, which is half land and half water. After the first week of use the propeller broke and I had to order a replacement. A few months later, the propeller broke again and the motor head stopped functioning at the same time. This is the last time I am ordering replacement parts for this thing! When it is functioning it makes a huge difference compared to the submersible pump I used to have that did not filter anything, as those burned out monthly and were constantly clogged. The water is clear and clean and this filter has not clogged once. I don't recommend it for terrariums that don't have deep water, as every time the water level drops it seems to die on me - though I have no idea what a better alternative may be. I am tired of spending $9.50 to replace the broken propellers!"
2,Happiness that Only Last for Two Weeks,"I bought the filter because it was the smallest I can found at the local pet store. I thought it would be strong enough for my SIX gallon tank, and it was, but only for about two weeks. Now my tank is full of the articles that float by the suction head. I am very disappointed and have to spend more money for a new filter."
2,Water is black and cloudy,"Just purchased our new carbon filter and after following the directions exactly.... the water in my tank turned black / grey and cloudy. I have switched out the water twice and the same thing occurs. Also, this might seem like a stupid question but on the colored pictures on the box the carbon is on top yet the directions say that the carbon pack should be placed on the bottom....HELP"
2,not worth the money,"I bought this filter after reading the mixed reviews, I side with the people that find it does not work well. I wish I could return it. I also agree with the using regular charcoal chips instead of buying the premade smooth bags, helps it work better but I am still changing water every few days due to odor and mess."
3,waste of money,first of all i bought this thinking it wold work for biger tanks 40 and above it only works for under 30 second i have used lots of fliters and have have had beter it does a ok job at cleaing the water with the help of another filter on the down side the filter is extreamly hard to get the flow going and this is many because it has at the most litel to no suction i mean it uses 4wats? wtf my clock uses more than that and it only displays the time where this needs to be abel to suck in water and 4 wats will not do it there is alos lots of litel problem like all the hard thing dont all fit and its hard to close the lid other than that if u want a cheep canaster filter than will barly do the job and be a pain get this if not spend the 150 or 250 and get a real canaster filter that will do the job right
5,availability,This book is essential for anyone doing Sephardic genealogy. Even though it is said to be unavailable here it can be purchased directly from the publisher (Avotaynu) for just $45.
5,Guillow,The model was a Christmas present and worked well for the age bought for. He was happy with it. Thanks.
3,A Disappointment,"I ordered this camera for my husband for Christmas. The features sounded amazing and I couldn't pass up an 8 megapixel camera that could fit in my pocket. While the camera had a lot of wonderful features, it sounded too good to be true and it was. The autofocus had a lot of trouble locking on a target. The result was over half the photos we took coming out fuzzy or blurry. It was simply too unreliable. We would never be able to go on vacation and hand the camera to a stranger to take our photo. It was a real shame the focus was so far off, because the camera had a lot of potential."
2,A little too country for me.,"I love Ryan Adams' music. I got hooked on Rock & Roll and have bought everything he's done (with the exception of his whiskeytown stuff). At first I turned my nose up to his more country albums but after a hiatus I listened to them again and enjoyed them immensley; however, this album was just too country for me. I'd like to be able to say it's just because of my dislike for country music in general but a friend of mine who does like country music and also loves Ryan's music did not care for it either. Just my opinion, don't be upset."
3,"Out in the pasture, on the fence","Ryan Adams's approach is to put out whatever he's into and let his audience take it or leave it. He's a very talented songwriter and musician who doesn't edit himself, and I'm happy to pay $40 a year to subscribe to him. This is an enjoyable record to listen to, but it's not notable in any way."
1,what in the hell are you people talking about?,"well, judging from the giddy cooing over this piece of warbling goo, it appears that the music audience in america has been dumbed too far down to recover.this cd is not only dull, but has nothing at all to say...just because you can make a cd doesn't mean you should.this is the first of hundreds of cds from my public library and/or private collection that will NOT be taking up space on my ipod.geez, people, this artless, self-indulgent pap is not worth listening to...can't you tell?"
1,Still flogging that dead horse!,"Give me a break! This CD is nothing but a quickly pasted together collection of even quicker forgotten lame attempts at trying to write a Classic Country track. Ryan my mate, you had it once, but now you have lost it. Start writing GOOD stuff again and maybe REAL music lovers like myself will have something to praise...but Im wasting my time cause there are far too many 'wankers' out there who think you are the best thing since Johnny Cash and Gram Parsons. This is no 'Sweethearts of The Rodeo' and it will be forgotten - quickly."
5,JCN is a pure country masterpiece,"hey so its a little twangy and rough around the edges. JCN still contains what makes each Ryan Adams album special: the strong lyrics that can tear a heart into pieces, his amazing band backing him, The Cardinals, and his magnificent voice. JCN is another great record, and Adams continues to prove he can produce wonderful music with a versatility that allows him to step into any genre and create a great record out of it. If you cant feel the emotion and soul in this record, youre sadly missing something truly special."
2,Not up to standard,"This doesn't seem to bother the other listeners here, but Adams can't seem to find a tune on most of these songs. His voice, usually the finest around, meanders around in a stagey way that is embarrassing to listen to, especially on ""Peaceful Valley"" and ""Hardest Part."" I'm a huge Ryan Adams fan, and the lyrics on this cd are some of his best, but I think it sounds awful, almost like a joke. If anything, I find it kind of insulting to country music."
4,Worth Reading,Technology and fun are what is in this book. It is very exciting you won't want to put it down. I had to do it for a independent study in english and I wasn't happy on doing it but this book made me happy and I did very well. A good young adult read.
4,"Easy instructions, but buttons reversed","So i am glad to now have a remote, but the panic button in red, and the top lock button are now in reverse. Not a problem, i can reprogram my brain, but ideally the programming was correct. I am going to order one more now so i can have two."
2,"Great Response, Lousy Accuacy","I am typig thi on this keyboard the same way I would type on a regular keboard -- or lightly lower. You ca see for yourselves te results.It's not that the keys are not workig, it is just that it is so sensiive to whee on the keys tht you trike, that it rops ltters rathr frequently.Cute toy, but not worth the money i you ca actually type."
2,Only for mechanics....,"Bottom line is this. If you're going to be typing like me, this keyboard isn't going to accurately reflect the keys you hit. If you're a mechanic and have to have a keyboard that is washable, and you just hit a few keys, go for it I guess. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A PMP, Computer, or PALM LIKE PRODUCT."
3,not for touch typists,"This keyboard while rather neat does not work well as a primary keyboard. The main problem is the lack of touch on the keyboard that makes blind entry of things like passwords difficult. Also the keyboard is rather pricey for what you get. I would say that it does appear to be relatively durable and yes, spillproof."
2,The Swimming Pool Keyboard,"KEYING is IMPRECISE as the keys wobble due to the flexible DESIGN. Intended for use in HAZARDOUS environments, as far as i can tell."
1,Silicone Flexible Keyboard,I bought this Keyboard around 10 months ago and have used it approximately a dozen times. The Number Keys along the top no longer work. This isn't the least expensive Silicone KB but works (or doesn't work) like it is. This KB is JUNK. It is the third Silicone KB I've bought in the last five years and has failed after very little use. You've been warned!!!
4,It does the job,"I bought this keyboard as an addition for our laptop when we travel. I haven't used it a lot, but it works fine for what I need. I don't use it regularly like I do a regular keyboard, it is only for those times when I don't want to type on the laptop itself. So, it does the job for what I purchased it for."
5,Quite Impressive,"I half expected this to be an ""Indian movie"", Bollywood without the singing. It's not. It's a well-written romance/comedy/drama that just happens to be about a particular set of people with their particular cultural issues.But the issues and emotions conveyed are sure to be shared by anyone who has friends and family with ties to competing and conflicting cultures."
1,One of the worst desi movies,"It had alot of promise but it falls flat on it's face in every way.plot idea - goodacting - badplot/script - BADIf you really want to watch this movie, rent it. But I wouldn't even waste the 2 dollars and the 2 hours of your life this movie will take."
2,Disappointing...very,"This moive has all the makings of a good story love, sex, culture, & finding one's self, but the actual plot was horrible. The moive drags on and on.. the inital plot seems to be just that a shell of a story, it has no real depth and didn't tackel the whole Desi's theory like I thought.. I learned more form American Chai than this."
2,.,"I'm not familiar enough with C.C.C.C. all around to generalize about their work, but after hearing many good things about the project, ""Flash"" left me rather disappointed. I'm all for the noise genre -- very interested in it in fact -- but C.C.C.C.'s sound simply left my ears bothered and my mind bored. It's just a lot of shrieking -- it doesn't feel like there's much imagination here, and the general sound just didn't inspire anything in me. I found the disc tiresome. I look forward to hearing a little more of C.C.C.C., but ""Flash"" failed to impress."
2,Spend a little more for a craftsman,"I went for the cheap option and bought this. It lasted me two days before the handle snapped off. It's ok for small branches, but if you try anything hard about and inch to 1.5 as it claims it can handle, its too much for it. I tossed this and bought a lifetime warranty craftsmans."
5,A Wonderful CD,"""Reveal"" by Girish is a CD of articulate beauty, accessible devotion and amazing musicianship. Girish weaves ancient Sanskrit mantras with contemporary and inventive melodies to bring chant out of the ashram and into the living room.I love this CD. I'm instantly enveloped by Girish's hypnotic vocals and lush arrangements every time I listen to it. His voice is deep and fluid, expressing the emotional calling of Kirtan through melodies that you come away singing. Yes, I find myself singing in Sanskrit, understanding the meaning even if I don't know what the words themselves mean, being connected to an ancient intelligence on a visceral level."
5,EXTRA-ORDINARY!,"Upon first listening to REVEAL, I found myself intoxicated by ancient sounds woven together by the modern hands of an artist who truly understands the soul's desire to experience something deeply transcendent. Strong, earthy tones permeate mantras often thought inaccessible are now open to many in this cross-culturally infused album. Girish's languid voice takes us on a journey where inspiring, heart-felt expression is mixed with a groove all its own. These subtle, jazz-like compositions set REVEAL apart from other chant albums, allowing those who may not usually swim in these waters a chance to dive in and feel immediately at home.To create an album with a unique sound, both vocally and instrumentally, is rare. To uplift and heal the spirit as well is...extraordinary!"
3,Good introduction to four fascinating characters.,"This book profiles four well-known Australians who have lived abroad for most of their adult lives. The book sets out to ""concentrate on the reasons for their expatriatism and consider what aspects of their Australian identity they have retained"". Sadly, the author relied totally on secondary sources, and did not speak directly to any of his subjects. This limited his ability to peer into their souls; to discover what effect their lives as expatriates have had on their work, and on them as people. In spite of this serious weakness, the author obviously spent a great deal of time studying his subjects. For anyone looking for an introduction to the lives of these incredibly talented Australians, the book is worth reading."
3,"great song, pointless single...","This is a great song from Le Tigre's 2004 album, ""This Island"". But if you like the song then you should just buy the whole album. There are no b-sides or remixes( which i'm not too fond of anyway). i gave it three stars because the song is great but the whole single is pointless."
2,Poor sound quality,"As per usual, these overpriced offerings are hit and miss in sound quality. This is a miss unless you are a diehard. Save your money and trade online."
4,The best Webkinz card deal!,"Look at the prices, and shipping costs. This is actually the bestWebkinz card deal available just now.I hadn't realized until now that the cards and the booster packs are identical.So, this deal is better than getting the 10 pack or the sealed box of 36 packs. We did the math.I can't tell you the quality of the cards, as they will be for Christmas presents for others, but I can tell you - get this selection if you want the most for your money!!!"
5,Great story,"I really enjoyed this story, an intelligent and gorgeous h and an alpha but good H. I liked the way the story played out and I liked the fact that they didn't fall in love after a few days. Well worth reading"
4,If you were there....,"If you grew up in the Philadephia (suburban) music scene in the early 1970's you knew that there were some really soulful songwriters like the Daryl Halls, John Oates, the Scott kid (forget his name, but loved his siter amy) , and Tim Moore... these guys started playin in some local bands and they had chops; some of my boys came up later listening to ""Behind the Eyes""... Sweet Naval Lightning was a touching tribute to the widowed and pregnant girlfriend of the Scott kid trying to give 'er some hope. Gave birth to a girl named Lamsha. Lost touch with Amy, but the music always takes me back."
2,disappointing,"I had the impression that the roller size was bigger on these. It's the attached fasteners that make it look that way in the pictures. I found using them awkward as well, don't care for the way they dangle either."
5,Fine and straight to full and curly,"I have given up hair cuts due to a tight budget and was frustrated with my fine, straight hair. I need to dress formally frequently for Eastern Star and want to look professional at work. I purchased this set as a gift to myself and am not disappointed. There are so many little rollers! The self-locking style is a bit tricky at first, but you just basically roll the hair and then turn the doo-hickey inside out. I heat them up while I'm blow drying my hair, a moment to roll, and let them set while I put on my make up. I end up with a full look and tons of curls in about 5 minutes! Thank you, Remington, for giving me style.Remington Wrap N'Roll Setter"
3,remington rollers,"The delivery was quick, which was great. The rollers heated up fast as well. When I first tried this product I couldn't get my hair wrapped nicely around the roller, some of the hairs were falling apart. Twisting the strands before rolling (included in their instructions) helped. When you finally get your hair in the rollers, it doesn't really take the long to get the hair curled."
1,Poor Refund Policy & Poor Customer Service,"Buyers Beware... I purchaed these rollers and used them one time. The rollers made my hair a bit frizzy so I decided to return them back to the seller. The seller has the rollers, but refuses to refund me in full because I used them one time. I will never purchase any items from this seller. I tried a different set of rolers from another seller and returned those as well. That seller gave me a full refund and also paid for the shipping back to them - Now that seller knows what ""Customer Service"" really means."
1,DUD SET,"This is the second set of curlers I have bought that were the wrap and roll. The first set worked so great I decided to get a set for my friend, unfortunately hers BARELY heat up and leave minimal curl. I thought maybe she was not leaving them on long enough so I went over to her house a week or 2 ago and plugged in her set and rolled up just one curler in my hair and left if for 30+ minutes, I had a ONLY a MINOR wave, nothing like the curl I recieve from my rollers. So I guess with a set like these it's 50/50 for heat and preformance"
2,Not completely satisfied right now,"I ordered these Monday night and received them Thursday afternoon, very quick delivery. The only ISSUE is that the product information stated 58 madeleines were in the box for [...], but when I checked there were only 44 madeleines in there. I am still trying to discuss this issue with them but I haven't heard anything yet. I feel that if your product information states a particular count, then there should be that many in there; otherwise change the product information so there won't be an issue. Very upset right now because I was charged more than what I should have been for these. We will see what they decide to do, and I will post back again."
2,What;s the point,"This is one of those books that after you finish it, you wonder why you bothered. It was neither particularly enlightening nor enjoyable. It uses the now-popular multiple narrator technique which, combined with the Russian names and their nicknames and diminutives, has you guessing for large parts of the book who is telling the particular chapter and who she/he is talking about. The problem is you don't care about the characters or their situations. You don't even learn very much about Tolstoy."
2,Very poor,"Tolstoy is one of my favourite writers and therefore I would assume that anything written about him would hold my attention. I was sorely disappointed with this book. It is unbelievable that someone could write on so great a man and fail to write anything meaningful. Very boring, uninspiring, strongly and strangely sexual, and unworthy of its subject."
3,Okay - where is the sound?,"Acting appears to be good. Script is fine - my problem is that the sound is very muddled and there are no closed captions - in 2011!!! Don't have a ""home theater"", just off the rack TV speakers and always watch with captions. Missed a lot of the movie because of this."
2,fast shipping...waste of 30 bucks they don't fit a 95 Nissan pickup,"I entered this item in the ""will it fit"" and amazon said that it would. Upon receiving it which the shipping was fast a++ on that, but I went to apply it to my vehicle and the factory plugs are different than the ones on the lights. The only things I could use from the lights were the clear lenses, screws for mounting and the brand new lamps inside the units. Bad buy on my part they should just sell the clear lenses not the whole unit. But shame on amazon for having incorrect information. These clear front bumper lights DO NOT FIT on a 95 Nissan Pickup XE."
3,Hay mejores,"Considero a nacha pop como uno de los mejores grupos pop de habla hispana. Las guitarras de los hermanos vega son limpias, armoniosas y aun con bastante fuerza. Es una lastima que este haya sido el ultimo de sus creaciones, hubiera sido interesante ver su evolucion despues de los ochentas.Le pongo 4 estrellas solamente por dos canciones, excelentes ambas: persiguiendo sombras y asustado estoy. El resto del disco es equis, ni fu ni fa.Si estas interesado en lo mejor de nacha pop te recomiendo mucho mas dibujos animados de 1995 o bien, su album en directo 80-88."
4,A very useful book for a Newbie,"Having just bought a dehydrator and living in the UK,there are no British books on drying food available over here. Therefore,I sent to the US for the book Dehydrator Delights and found it extremely useful in giving me a start on the road to dehydrating.The book gives drying times for different foods and then recipes for those foods. All in all a very handy book for a beginner like me."
4,Good but dated,"This is a good book but just realize that its a bit dated and there may be better and more up to date books out there. If you can get this cheap then go ahead, otherwise, look for something more up to date."
5,jewelry,This toe ring is exactly like it's pictured. It has a matte finish while being still shiny. It is extremely comfortable. Great value too.
2,You won't be missing anything,"Don't worry you won't be missing on anything if you haven't seen this video.Comparatively Cesar's video, presentation, direction, and style is very unique, that nothing comes close to it.I have just watched this once."
5,Perfect,I needed a rake and this was the perfect one for me. It is not wood so it would not splinter like the last one I had. Delivery was good and product was well packaged.
5,Light little rake,"Fantastic rake for the money. I was skeptical because the rake did not look like the old long tined rakes I used to use when I was a kid... but this thing is excellent. Super light, nice spring to the tines, and a good plastic grip make raking a breeze.Good luck with your spring clean up."
3,lawn rake,Really a light item and it arrived with a bent handle. The big risk with ordering this is that the handle is aluminum tubing and could really suffer if something is dropped on it. Intact I probably would have given a better review.
1,real list price,"List price direct from Corona is $17.38RK 62061Tempered spring steel for greater durability and long service lifeBi-curved bow gives even pressure to all tines for maximum raking efficiencyTines apply light pressure for debris removal3 Rivets hold head to handle25 Extra-wide tinesDouble crimps hold tines in place54"" Long Lightweight metal handle with anti-slip vinyl sleeved handle for gripping comfort"
5,Very fast!,The boots are amazing! I bought them fr my birthday and he loves them an we received ten very quickly!
2,Disappointed,"These are very, very tight fitting! I recommend buying a couple of sizes larger than your normal or you will have trouble sliding your foot in!"
4,"Lacrosse 18"" Alphaburly","I only had one opporunity to wear the boots so far but they appear to be very well constructed and what I had been looking for (a very good quality, comfortable rubber boot to wear for achery hunting). They are just a bit snug around the ankle when trying to take them off, but feel good while walking and standing all day. They are a little bit heavier than my previous pair, but I am still happy with them and this added weight will give me a little better excercise. I have tried on at least 5 other top brands and I would recommend Lacrosse boots as well this model to others.If I had one note to the manufacturer it would be to put a zipper up the inside to make it easier to tighten along with the little strap in the back."
3,Mitchum's second starring role for RKO.,"This is Mitch's follow up to Nevada, both made at RKO. Again he is teamed up with Richard Martin in his almost famous Chito Rafferty role. Also in this one is the lovely Barbara Hale, who would gain fame as Perry Mason's side kick Della Street. Hale actually steals this movie from Mitch and the others. In between Nevada and this one, a very interesting thing happened to Mitchum, similar to John Wayne's experience in Stagecoach that would propel him out of B grade Westerns and features. He was cast in a supporting role in The Story of G. I. Joe and was nominated for an Academy Award. Soon Mitch would no longer be doing oaters like this one."
3,Barbara Hale ;emerging starlet,"Puts on cowboy clothes to be a "" woman's libber "" from sexual advances and disguises herself in ""drag""most of the movie. Her cowboy clothes are too baggy for any feminine sexuality to be expressed. She needed Edith Head to slim her cowboy clothes down ,ala, Jane Russell from "" Son of Paleface "". Too bad for us."
5,something new,A fast paced story line that takes a fresh approach to sports nonfiction. Turns a fantasy football league into a nightmare.
2,Sort of wasted my money.,"This stuff smells good and makes my skin have a nice tingle, but there is one flaw I didn't consider - the directions have you let this partially dry, then rub it in, then partially dry and then rub it so it rolls in little bits off of your skin, revealing new skin underneath. YES, it DOES make me have a nice tingle and it DOES make my skin feel soft, HOWEVER, you really have to rub your face and you are stretching your skin all over the place, it just felt SO WRONG to be pulling, pushing and stretching my skin like that to make the product roll off and sprinkle into the sink. I don't feel right using it, so it was sort of a waste of money."
5,Great!!!,great on sensitive skin! i use it every week and my skin looks and feels awesome. Will purchase this products again
1,Not so much!,This is probably the first product that I really have to say I didn't like.I have had the gel peels and I thought this was like it. I felt like I was rubbing my face off and it didn't leave my skin refreshed or even remove much of the dry skin. I don't have much dry skin but I did on my forehead and it didn't remove it more than a regular scrub would. And I have micro scrubs that are soooo much better. Sorry Guys'I would return it but I can't be bothered.
5,Educational,This book is not a cookbook. This is a book on how to cook. It explains how to prepare food and why you prepare the food. It is great for someone who is clueless in the kitchen such as myself.
1,False Advertising,"This book does not describe the author's techniques. It is essentially a sales brochure, full of reasons you should buy Mr. Sheets' expensive video course. The book only hints at Mr. Sheets' techniques, providing too little detail to be of use and constantly implying that real success comes from buying his course. If you want to learn from Mr. Sheets, don't buy this 300 page advertisement. I think, though, that anyone who would disguise a sales brochure as an instructional book isn't worth your time."
3,"Sheets' book is right on,BUT........","As a Real Estate Investor for approx. 5 years now,I appreciate this book.While it is short on details and long on the end product,Mr. Sheets is right on the money.You really can become wealthy by investing in rental properties,but it does,understandably,take time and EFFORT!To be successful,as I am,you must take some risks.You must give up at least some of your couch/TV time.You must have some money to start with,credit lines or whatever,and you must do it today! Simply buying the course isn't enough.You must at some point put the book down and actively start doing it.Remember,NOTHING WORKS UNTIL YOU DO!Each of us and no one else are responsible for our actions or inactions.Action and Inaction are CHOICES. Good Luck"
2,Fluff,"Mainly filled with testimonials and trying to sell his other expensive products (which can be had at auction sites for a fraction of their original cost by the way). No numbers, mainly just how to locate no-money-down deals. No-money-down deals can be disasterous, especially to the novice, by the way. Having said that, you could probably glean one or two tidbits about finding willing sellers, whether you purchased for nothing down or not, so I didnt rate it a one."
4,Great for first time buyers,I read this book when I was in the process of purchasing my first home. This book was loaded with tidbits of information that helped me negotiate the sale which saved me thousands of dollars. I recommend this book to anyone looking to save a few bucks in buying real estate.
3,accurate concise information on real estate investing,"As a former Calif real estate broker who has invested in real estate myself, and continues to do so, I find Sheet's advice to be solid information on building a retirement income or creating a nest egg with tax advantaged real estate investments"
1,An Infomercial,"There are 41 testimonials. The book is only 284 pages long. Every other page Mr. Sheets is telling what is in his home study course and how you can get it. This book is an INFOMERCIAL in paperback. Just another Real Estate wanna-be guru telling you if it doesn't work,YOU aren't doing it right."
5,Biting,Dexter's stories about life in America may be the most inciteful observations being written today. Spellbinding prose.
4,give me more,"love dexter...laughed out loud, cried and finished way too soon. I just hope that there is another novel in the works!"
3,An editor could have made a huge difference,"The subject matter of this novel was what drew me, but as other reviewers here have mentioned, the book has flaws. My main complaint was that there were too many characters. I could not keep track of them all, and think that a lot of them should have been either developed more or dropped altogether. Bob the boyfriend, for one, whose only function it seems was to talk to her on the phone once or twice. The romantic connection between the detective and Sasha was just not believable. Still, she has a way of writing that grabbed my attention, so I struggled through reading plot sidetracks that often went nowhere. I will try to find another one of her books, and see if she has developed as a writer, or at least gotten a better editor. But as another reviewer said, I'll get it from the library next time."
2,It doesn't seem to be an original Nike item,"This watch is very nice, but the back and the way it is finished seems quite strange. I cannot say I'm sure it is an original Nike item, although warranty and label."
2,Ennui For All,"I purchased this DVD hoping to watch a fascinating and in-depth look at Haiti's amazing but unsung revolutionary period, and instead found a rather dry documentary that merely skimmed the surface.If you're at square one and know nothing of Haiti's history, the documentary is fine. But for one who already knows something of this period in Haiti's history, you aren't going to learn anything more than you already knew by watching this DVD."
4,Great Film,A great documentary that is a useful primer for understanding the complex and epochal events surrounding Haitian independence.
4,4 1/2 stars...Great read...,I've absolutely loved all the books that I've read by Lorraine Heath and this book didn't disappoint either. The story-line in this book was really great and I loved the adventure and surprises. This book had me laughing out loud as well as shedding a few tears. I really enjoyed all the characters in this book and can't wait to read more of them in the rest of the series.This was the first of three books in the Rogues of Texas series and it looks like it'll be a promising series. I would recommend this great read. Lorraine Heath is a fantastic writer.
4,A Very Interseting Book,"This book is very interesting book from beginning to end, with a few touches of humor. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book that is fun to read."
3,Disappointing,"What happened to Hautman? Did he have a deadline? This book comes way short of my expectations. I was halfway through and still wondering when it was going to take off. But it never did. If I hadn't enjoyed Hautman's others so much, I might have enjoyed it more. But it stunk in comparison."
3,"Decent, But He's Done Better","As in his previous books, Drawing Dead and the excellent The Mortal Nuts, Hautman brings Carl Hiassan's tradition of wild and wacky characters to small-town Minnesota. When a 30ish single woman wins the Powerball lottery, she offers $1,000,000 for the return of her missing no-good husband, who disappeared six years ago. This is catalyst for shady shenanigans as he and his girlfriend head back to collect the money. Of course there are other people seeking to claim the reward themselves, etc... Everything ends true to formula, and it doesn't have quite the sharp bite that his other books do."
3,"""Most Baffling"" tends to be ""most predictable.""","Overall, Sydney Hosier's latest installment tends to be predictable at times. Characters appear, and the topics they discuss lead toward solving the mystery too quickly. I do have to state that the book is not predictable enough to guess the murderer(s), and the motive(s)."
4,Like this toy,Bought this for my son. He is having a lot of fun with it. Seems to be holding up well.
5,violent,"This anime is NOT for children,but if your a fan of graphic violence,brief nudity,and adult language that this is for you.I thaught the anime was good,it was interesting is one that you woulden't watch just once,but watch more that one if you like violent anime's."
1,Poorly executed film offers nothing,"Ex-KGB agent is forced to protect a young girl from a vampire who may not be what he seems. Fair acting and animation are completely derailed by extreme gore, severe faltering in logic and truly awful characters. Skip this one."
2,Could Have Been Better,I bought this title and part of me is sorry I did. I had to watch it five times to understand it . The idea has promise . Personly I think there was too much unneeded violence. The dubbing was not the best and the animation is alright. Things are too disoriented to make sense. Don`t buy it.
1,Don't waste your money.,"We were putting our house up for sale and decided to purchase these stair carpet protectors. When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was they smell terrible. I thought they will probably lose the smell after a couple hours or a day at the latest. Nope. The smell lasted for weeks until we took them up. They also would not stay on the stairs. They kept popping up and sliding off the stair. It became hazardous to walk down the stairs so we decided to take them up. Big waste of money."
2,Durable and thick but too stiff,We bought these protectors to replace older ones when we had the stairs recarpeted. These are much thicker than the others and in turn are not very malleable; they come off quite easily and can be a hazard when going down the stairs. In order to get them flexible enough to even stay on the carpeted steps I had to warm them in the oven for about 5 minutes at 175 degrees and try to reform them to grip on the lip of the step. My advice is to try a thinner and cheaper model.
1,don't even bother buying,I should have trusted the bad reviews. These carpet protectors are a safety hazard. They are very stiff and do not stay on the carpet very well. Not like the picture at all...They also smell really strange...not your typical vinyl/plastic type of smell...very bad odor. I would not recommend these at all.
2,Un-Bendable!,These came in a two pack. Which i guess i didn't read the explanation clearly enough! 2 for 11+ shipping I would of never purchased. Also They are impossible to put on the stairs. I'm going to try a hairdryer. They are super thick plastic that got crammed into a too small box for shipment so are curved the long way. Then the part that is supposed to go over front of stairs is impossible to move! Overall these seem pretty junky. And they do smell. Hopefully that goes away.
4,Affordable and easy to clean,Very pleased with product. Easy to clean and steps are still visible as compared to the carpeted stair treads.
1,clear stair treads carpet protector,"This is very hard plastic. Items arrived wrinkly and it's so hard to straighten. We used a gun heater to make it softer and pressed hard to straighten, they got softer but after few minutes got hard again and wrinkly. Now they are sitting in my junk room. What a waste of money. I wanted to return but I don't want to spend money for postage. So don't buy this. I am very disappointed."
1,UNUSABLE,"I HAVE HAD THIS ITEM IN OUR OTHER HOUSE AND WERE GOOD, THESE STAIR MATS WERE SO STIFF, THEY WOULD NOT LAY FLAT AND THE ROUND PART TO GO OVER THE STAIRS WERE FLATTENED AND COULD NOT SHAPE THE STAIRS, I EVEN TRIED HOT WATER TO SOFTEN THE MATERIAL, IT WOULD JUST REMAIN STIFF AFTER THEY COOLED. I PURCHASE 12 SETS, AND ALL CANNOT BE USED :("
2,Do not buy these,"Don't let the picture fool you, these stair carpet protectors will not stay in place, no matter what you do."
5,just what I needed,"We received these in record time. I was worried about the smell that alot of the reviews talked about but there wasn't any smell. We did have to use a heat gun to soften the plastic to mold over our stairs, but they are working great. The nap on our carpet is very deep so we had to use little decorative carpet tacks to hold the stair protectors in place. Other than that we love them!"
2,Does not work on thick carpet,"The gripper teeth are not long enough and will barely stay on the carpet. I've had mine on the stairs for several days and it's not improving at all. Like other reviewers have written, they are neither deep enough or long enough for the step and therefore only partially protected. I understand the measurements are available prior to purchase but since I can't find any product with the right specs available,this is where I will leave my gripe. The lip that is supposed to go over the front of the step sticks out and does not hold down. I followed a recommendation from another site and used a hair dryer to try and soften the plastic but it did not help. I knew this product had slim chances (based on reviews) of being worth while but I had to give it a try anyway."
2,Still stink,"After having these stair protectors for many years, around 8 I think, the vinyl still smells very strong. And it is not a pleasant smell either. They do work well and protected the stairs but man do they stink."
5,PROTECT YOUR STAIRS EASILY,My dear cats have recently started to sharpen their claws on my two stairs.I purchased these stair protectors.They are stable on the stairs and they keep my cats at bay. lol
1,Waste of money,Already in the trash can! Could not use. Too stiff to conform to steps. Would not stay in place on this steps.
4,Holly&Ivy Plates - Good; Amazon service not so great,"I ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my wife. It was advertised as a service for four. However, when the package arrived there were only enough dinner plates for three. Another case of needing to be a lawyer to read the fine print of an item for sale or when there is a problem."
2,This one man needs to resupply...,"Well, hard to say it but I did not like this album when I first listened to it, and months later I still don't. Two tracks are good, ""one man"" and ""resupply"". That's it. Disappointing for this great musician, personnality, and one of my favourite bass players (I use to say he is third, just behind Marcus Miller and Stanley Clarke). Is he out of gas after his band's split up ? This album sounds at times like a demo tape from a young beginner trying to find his way... Mark, please resupply !"
1,"Boring, Tired and Dull","I can not express my disappointment of the ""One Man"" release. Mark's talents do show through, dispite ""sing-a-song"" tunes. What are we supposed to come away with? Mark's singing; great. Mark's playing; SERIOUSLY abandoning his God given skills.To Mark - PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE show us why you are a bassist, NOT a folk singer! I love your playing too much to HAVE to listen to words."
3,A refreshing glimpse of Level 42's Bass Man,"If you are used to typical Level 42 music, then you know their Bassist, Mark King, is a bit......hyperactive. One Man, Mark's first solo effort following the split up of Level 42 is a collection of flowing, melodic songs in which Mark show's more of his composing capability and less of his million mile an hour bass playing. The Bass Lines are truly beautiful and the album in entirety is a must have for any Level 42 fan. If you are not a Level 42 fan, give it a shot, you might like what you hear."
4,Awesome if you can hear it....,"It's awesome hearing the poetry in the voices of the poets, and I understand that these are amazingly rare and old recordings, but maybe it wasn't worth including pieces that just can't be understood? Or relate that fact to the customer so that they understand that the quality is diminished because of the oldness and rarity of the pieces.A follow up reading by a contemporary poet on those pieces would add value to the set, and allow the customer two views of the written work."
4,Poetry,"Some of the newer poetry left me cold, but as a rule it's a most delightful collection. Hearing Walt Whitman was awesome."
5,fun and fantasy,"I must admit I am sucker for Nina's humor and wit. When I am reading a book, i am looking for an escape and a way to relax. Crime tends to be too dark and romance alone alittle dull. This book is a great combination of paranormal, mystery (just who is trying to kill the main character?), mild angst (will they find a way to be together?), and humor. With a continuing cast of characters you get a peek (though sometimes very brief) into the lives of past characters. That being said, it can also be read out of order, or as a stand alone, as enough explanation is given to support the reader."
2,Help...I'm drowning,"The storyline drowns under the weight of one liners, cliches, and a multitude of subplots. Can't seem to get interested in the hero or heroine, much less the ""cutsie"" supporting characters no matter how numerous. At page 86 I'm considering cutting my losses, doubt I can endure to page 100, never mind finish this beast. Just happy I didn't actually invest any money in this one, returning to the library unfinished."
3,What's Really Funny is I Bought This Book Twice!!!,"....and both times were basically a mistake. Having read this author before--when I am at the bottom of my to-be-read pile--I did notice some positive changes. Her characters are more developed, having depth and something to SAY and DO rather than just pose and make attempts at snappy patter. However, overall this author requires enormous amounts of whimsy and some days that is too much work for this reader to maintain. I mean, when you name your characters Studly McStud and Sparkle Stardust--whoops!--made up the first name--but she does use the second--it's just too much. Just imagine how many trees were lost creating Sparkle....and I contributed TWICE!"
2,Firebird owner,"THis is a fairly extensive book but there is one problem with it. It does not state anywhere that this is only for the years 1964 to 1972. If I had know that I would not have ordered it. If you are trying to restore a car within those years and are looking for parts that will work, this is the book for you."
1,DISASTER,The specs are pure rubbish. It is painfully slow and print is fuzzy. It runs through ink cartridges like crazy. I have to change color cartridges even if i don't print a single color page.I would love to take a solid baseball bat to it.Go buy a Panasonic KX FLB 881 and see the difference yourself.
2,"Poor sound quality, no EQ","This player has it all: FM radio, MP3 playback, a remote, and it's joggable with a special hand strap. The earphones, by the way, are excellent! What this device suffers from is poor sound quality, with meager means of customization. You have two options when it comes to sound processing: Bass boost on (which makes the music sound blown out and distorted) or bass boost off. Overall, music sounds unpronounced and muffled. I've tried using the player with a few different sets of earphones, all with the same effect. This device towers over others, especially at price-point, on functionality. I mean, it does it all. But unfortunately, sound quality suffers on this device. If that's not important to you, this might be a good player for you. If you want to hear high quality playback, this isn't for you. I really think that if JVC had included more options for equalization (EQ), the sound playback issues wouldn't be so overshadowingly bad."
2,Poor battery perfomance,"Poor battery performance and the difficulty of making sure the unit is completely turned off have spoiled my satisfaction with this CD player. All too often, I have tried to play a CD only to find that the unit has mysteriously changed to the FM mode (I never listen to the radio so I never turn that mode on) and exhausted the batteries. Although the unit will turn itself off if accidentally left on while playing CDs, this does not apply to the FM mode. It will play until the batteries are exhausted, and with only 20 hours battery playtime to begin with, this means FREQUENT battery changes. There should be an AC adaptor readily available for this player with the other available accessories, as this is the only way I am going to be able to afford to use it."
5,Top rank,"I have a very hard time finding music I love to listen to. Even listening to sample cuts doesn't tell you the whole story -so it's a bit hit-and-miss. This was definitely a hit for me. Besides the incredible creativity, they hooked me as a rabid fan when I found each of their tracks was different from each other rather than just a variation of the same sound over-and-over. Music is highly subjective but the Helium album is so damn good I listen to it over and over without getting tired of it. Very rare for me."
4,Valentine54,"Interesting characters but the plot screams soap opera. I enjoyed the book until the end, and the story got predictable and slow. Reading about the relationships of the characters was more interesting than the plot, but I liked the book anyway."
3,A star for each Miss Margaret,"The story of 3 elderly Georgia women, all Margaret, and the history of how they became friends, a mystery of why they're so important in the community, and why they're hated by Laurel.I did get tired of the hints that something was going to be revealed and just wanted to get on with the story. I got the impression there wasn't much of a story there to start with -- other than history and why there was a dead woman in the cabin -- and that the author needed to rely on hinting there would be a story there eventually to make the book hit 300 pages."
3,Tough Reading but Be Persistant!!,"This book was a bit hard to follow because the author kept jumping from the present to past times. I had a hard time following along but this may be because I had a few glasses of wine before I broke out the book each night. I was totally confused until the last part of the book when everything was explained in detail. The ""fake"" interview with the author that was attached at the end of the paperback version was very telling. I would have only given this book two stars if I hadn't read all the other interviews, but being very easily influenced I decided to give it four stars, otherwise I'd be raked over the coals by more serious readers. An okay book."
3,Pretty good mystery with colorful characters,"I really liked the characterizations in TTMM. The author has a handle on fleshing out the population of her little southern town. She also has a good sense of interesting dialogue and plot. So many of the novels that I've read lately are either one or the other, and it was nice to get more than one facet in this book.I would have given this book 4 stars had it not been for the ending. I was expecting more of a dirty-little-secret kind of revelation, but that's not what I got. In fact, it seems like the story was leading up to something really wham-bang, but the payoff was lacking.Overall it was a good novel and Shaffer is a real talent."
5,Fresh!,"These were good walnuts. Not crazy about the plastic bags but these are by far the tastiest walnuts,,more expensive but they taste good and are organic. Why must healthy food be costly and hard to find? Anyway I couldn't find these again to re-order so I am trying another brand. I will just have to look out for these."
2,quality has diminshed recently,"This has been a disappointing item the last few shipments. The quality of the walnuts has been deteriorating so much so that I have cancelled the last two shipments. Has the nut crop been drastically affected by some problem? The walnuts, almonds and pistachios seem to have been affected in the last three months. Previously I have been totally satisfied with the Sun Ridge products."
3,It's a Chiltons,"As far as repair manuals go for the vintage, it's pretty good, They never have everything you need though. I haven't seen too many errors but there are a few (identifying WHICH parts are on the vehicle and how it relates to the manual information is always an issue)."
1,meh.,"when I ordered this coil remote, they sent me an e-mail saying it was out of order. i got a refund but was very dissapointed with the way they handled their buisness. the good news is that i guess this things are dangerous if they are cut when co2 or hpa is running throuh them. I had a friend who had 4 cracked ribs after his coil remote stopped smacking his body. so its a good thing but a bad thing at the same time."
1,"Remote yes, Slide check no",The components are cheap and non durable. The slide check failed the first time I used it and I had to replace it with a part purchased at a local store. The vendor did not respond to my Email concerning the problem. The replacement with a $16 part made this bargain no bargain. The screw valve is also defective and will need to be replaced soon as well.
4,not totally what i expected,"I got the product on time as usual from this seller, the only problem was the shut off was not installed on the remote. Why did i pay for something that i had to install myself? Luckily i had the teflon tape anyways so i took the remote apart and installed the slide check. Overall i would say it works well so far. The seller should be more descriptive if you have to put the thing together on your own."
4,Great remote for beginners,"This summer was my first really getting into paintball, and this remote was probably the highlight of my gear. I had friends who kept saying I needed to get one to make my gun lighter, and boy were they right! The slide check is great, and it also has a quick release making it really really easy to disconnect the air from the gun. My friend's remote doesn't have that, it made him really jealous. The connections were all fine, no leaks what so ever. And with a whole day of running around playing woodsball I never once got tangled in the coils or had anything come loose. The absolute only cons I found:1) The coils are a bit too taut, you can definitely feel resistance when it stretches out.2) One time the slide check got caught on my vest and turned the air off, quick fix though so no real issue"
4,A thorough survey of myth and scientific evidence,"This excellent book covers most of the well known variations of ""sea monsters"" (sea serpents, giant squids, sharks, leviathan, etc.) by first summarizing the popular myths and legends about each monster.The author then adds up whatever hard scientific facts are available, which in some cases (i.e., the ""leviathan"" or whale) is a whole lot of material. In other cases (e.g., the giant squid), scientific evidence is harder to come by and is largely speculation.If you have even a casual interest in sea monsters, you'll find this book worthwhile reading, although you might be disappointed by the unfortunate lack of factual and scientific evidence surrounding some of the more elusive creatures (which is no fault of the author)."
5,Fun Toy,"This doodle bear is just too cute. My 6 year old loves it! She does want to wash it every day, which gets old, but does not make this any less fun."
5,A really good deal for a CD single.,"Not only do you get the hit song Adia, but this CD also includes the hits Angel and I Will Remember You. So you have three great songs in one place."
4,As close as it gets,As an immigrant from Pakistan this book brought back many memories of times past.The story is a tapestry woven as a fairly realistic depiction of the values and perceptions of families in some segments of Pakistan.It portrays the effect of education in the liberation of the main female character (Sajida) within the confining constraints of the social milieu.The treatment and the double standards for male and female offspring is depicted well except for a few exaggerated instances.The American immigrant experience is both hilarious and endearing to readers whose experiences mirror those of the aunts family.Great job Ms. Haq!I hope there will be more socio-cultural novels.
1,Selling a stereotype,"This novel is an earnest one, revisiting familiar themes of the backward west and the progressive American dream. It is also mediocre in terms of literary quality and stereotypically simplistic about complicated lives in both Pakistan and the U.S."
5,Very Good London Green Croquet Set,"Excellent set for people wanting to go beyond tiny, light-weight mallets and balls but not wanting to pay $1000+ for a full Association set. Very nice appearance and materials. My set has held up well for years. Wickets are thick and sturdy, but wide enough for rough lawns. Mallets are hefty and adult sized, allowing the full range of strokes. Balls are okay, but I did get a slightly better set of polymer balls after a couple of seasons' play. This set's not cheap, but it's by far the best mid-price set."
4,Good set for the price (of $50),"This set has good design and material, but it received only 4 stars because the craftsmanship could be better. I find it mildly annoying that the pieces are not seamless, and you can identify very minor imperfections here and there. Don't get me wrong, it's hard to mold these patterns without leaving one or two tiny bumps or dents behind. That's why I say this is a good set for the price."
3,Tableware,The Yamazaki tableware I bought is very pretty and very substantial.The only problem I have with it is that the forks' handles are so large on the ends they don't fit into my dishwasher silverware slots.
5,A beautiful flatware set - you won't regret getting it!,I absolutely love this flatware set. The quality is excellent and I am so happy my wife decided to get it. You will not find a better set anywhere for the price. Each piece was wrapped invididually in plastic for protection and they shine perfectly. I highly recommend it for yourself or for a gift. You will need to get a gift box if you are giving it away though. Do not hesetitate in getting this set. You will not regret it.
3,not at par with Yamazaki,"based on expectations of previous purchases by this manufacturer, I found this pattern, Princess Ann, to be NOT at par with the Brand. The packaging deemed it to be a closeout due to quality issue. I returned 3 sets."
3,Good keyboard solution for laptops,"Good keyboard solution for laptops, but does not have the same ""touch"" as a hard keyboard. Takes some getting used to."
1,Fell apart after just a few months,"I bought this for my nephew last Christmas after he saw a similar keyboard in the new ""Die Hard"" movie and just had to have one. Less than six months later and the thing has literally come apart - he went to unplug it from his computer and the USB connector pulled apart, leaving half stuck in the computer and half still connected to the keyboard cable. I deal with USB devices all the time and have never seen anything like this; this is just poor craftsmanship, plain and simple. If you buy this, do yourself a favor and get the replacement plan as well."
4,keyboard,"Hi,The flexible Kyb works fine, however at times you have to type hard, otherwise you'l missed 1 or 2 alphabetsAlso it would be a graet help if a curser is included, like in the laptopVuong"
2,"Nice, but.....","Since I am on the road a lot and need good equipment, I thought this was going to be a great keyboard.Then I used it. It's easy to install -- plug it in.But, the keys are marginal at best. The one shift key hardly works and if you are a speed typer, you will slow to a crawl. You have to really, really strike the keys hard and then it might work. So if you have a lot to do in a short time -- find a better keyboard.If you will be a light user -- it might work for you.I do like how thin it is. If they could fix the keys -- this would be a great tool. I am not sure sure it us worth the space it takes up."
1,Disappointment,I was very excited about this keyboard because I tend to spill things. Although it is super easy to plug and play it is NOT easy to type on. The keys do not easily respond. It requires a very percise deep stroke each and every time. I could not get the space bar to work consistently.I returned it.
2,Works... but,"This keyboard is neat and all but the amount of force you need to use to type I fear I'll have carpal tunnel syndrome in a few weeks. Really, I'm surprised about the amount of force you need to use to type. I'm constantly backing up and deleting to position the cursor where a letter was left out. Here, I'm not going to replace any missed letters: I tpe at least 60 word a minute nd on this keyboard I am typing abot 20 to 25 becaue f the force necessary to type and ll the backing u.If you type fast and like a feather touch this is not your keyboard--you will hate this. I'm sending mine back.That said, it's flexible and cool looking. My 6 year old loves it."
4,Foldable/flexible keyboard review,"The keyboard is extremely attractive when it comes to the so absolute silence in the office when one is typing. But there's an inconvenience, and this doesn't really have the keyboard manufacturer's fault at all but people being so used to typing on conventional kayboards: the character or space in the text would not appear if one presses the corner of the keyboard key. While one is used to type text even when the finger hits a corner of a key on a conventional keyboard, this doesn't happen in this portable keyboard and the character or space won't appear when the finger hits the corner of a key on this portable keyboard. Some re-training (at home, not at work) would be needed in order to get used to the keyboard, and the typing speed (slower at first on this portable keyboard) could gradually recover and increase to its normal speed. Excellent for travel!"
4,Simple. Durable. Good for the Road.,I'm an independent radio producer and I use this keyboard with myTASCAM HDP2 Portable Stereo Recorder. It's a great keyboard for basic file manipulation and functionality but I wouldn't get one as part of a set up where I was doing a lot of data entry or typing. Definitely good for what it is.
3,Good. if you knw what you are buying.,"This is a good keyboard as long as its not meant to be a replacement for a regular keyboard. In these keyboards the amount of energy required to make sure that the key is pressed makes you want a regular keyboard.I have slowly gotten used to it, but its still a long way to go...."
1,unable to use,"I like the idea of this keyboard and for those who type one letter at a time, very very slowly and hard, this product will work for them. However, for those who types normally, this is unusable."
4,A good backup keyboard,"I bought this as a backup to my wireless keyboard. I didn't want another old keyboard cluttering my limited workspace, and this fits the bill. It always works when I need it, and when I don't; I just roll it up and shove in the back of a desk drawer."
2,Decent for the money,"Cheap and easy to install, but you must hit the buttons just right to make them work."
3,"It's quiet, but too hard to type on","I am a fast and noisy typist (I type with 4 fingers and a thumb at high speed, and that makes a normal keyboard loud). This keyboard is completely quiet, but it is just too hard to type well, especially the space key. I find that it drops about every 20th keystroke, even though it is clearly pressed. The space key is not a big wide key as normal and it is unreliable. The problem is not the angle of press (as some have said), but the way the material has to compress to make contact. In theory you can learn to type well, but I will not use as a regular keyboard as it is just too hard. It is still useful for certain situations, so I am keeping it.Note that I really want to like it, but they could have done this a lot better. I had a similar style keyboard years ago which had folds in the material, which acted as guides so that the keys always dropped in straight and cleanly. It is a shame no one makes these any more (that was for industrial use)."
4,An ok keyboard,This keyboard is ok. Just kind of hard getting used to. Instead of the keys going straight down they seem to tilt left or right when pressed. The big plus is that things spilled on it won't kill it like so many keyboards of mine that have met their doom by spilled liquids. I will definately continue to use it. A good investment for the clutzy people like me. Don't have to worry about stray paper clips or other small metal things screwing it up.
3,Not responsive,"I wanted a keyboard to throw in my laptop bag and this one is good for that, but you have to really press the keys hard at times. When I try to type at normal speed, a lot of characters are missing. I find myself not using it very often."
2,Nice Idea But Otherwise Not Very Useful,"I bought this to use with my laptop when I travel. I've been taking a traditional keyboard in my suitcase. If you want something to poke on without worrying about keeping up with your typing speed, then this might be fine...but for me it was useless. I type about 80 WPM and it was a disaster on this keyboard, even when I typed slowly and made sure to hit each key hard enough to depress it.My gym uses a keyboard like this. It's used for poking in your name at the registry desk and is splash proof. So, it does have a niche, but just not for typing reports, long documents, etc. I'm sticking with the traditional keyboard and will continue to take one of them along on my trips."
1,Flexible keyboard,"Foldable/flexible Full Blk Kyb Spill Resistant Great Key ResponseThis is not for a typist, it might be o.k. for a two-finger typist. The touch is very hard and it's almost impossible to hit the space bars with the right thumb. I would not recommend this to someone who does touch typing."
2,Not a suitable keyboard replacement,"I bought this keyboard in the hopes of having a fancy roll-up keyboard to use with our Dell Mini laptop. The Dell's keyboard on the device is very tiny so a full size keyboard would be a welcome addition, especially one that rolls up for travel.The concept is great, but this keyboard is executed poorly. The keys are far to difficult to press and, as a touch typist, there were excessive mistakes made as a result of keys not triggering. Additionally, the backspace key is in the WRONG PLACE and is too far too reach. I don't know what they were thinking on this front.I am returning the keyboard."
1,Functionality,"The foldable keyboard is highly mobile but requires a lot of pressure for typing. prolonged typing on this keyboard results in painful finger joints. The left side shift key has to be depressed in a special way in order to make cap letters. In all, it is quite aggravating to use."
1,flexible keyboard a waste,"It never worked, after I got it I hooked it up and it worked for about five minuted and then it just stopped and then it wouldn't even let my mouse work. I was going to send it back but that's alot of work and I work full time and have three kids.So I just got had."
3,"Great idea, needs improvement....","I love the idea of this keyboard, yet I found that about half the time I was typing was spent hitting the backspace button and correcting my errors. The errors were not really mine: I was striking the correct key and the key was pressed down, but apparently I was not hitting the key in precisely the right way which caused the keystroke not to register. Other reviews had warned me of this, and I thought that maybe it was just them, and that I would not have this problem. Well, heed the warnings- you too will spend much of the time backspacing and recapitalizing and hitting the space bar. I found the keyboard great and properly responsive for numerical data entry- I had no trouble with that for some reason. It is a well made, durable keyboard, but I found it to be incredibly frustrating to type unless you really focus on hitting the keys hard. If you have a light touch on the keys you will probably have trouble."
2,Not the greatest...,"Not pleased with this product at all. You have to hit the keys so hard that my wrists were hurting in a matter of about 10 minutes of typing. Further if you don't hit the keys in exactly the right spot, it doesn't register the stroke. Really not comfortable to type on. I don't recommend this product at all. :("
1,Sucks,"This product did not work at all with my system. It did not lay flat, and was very difficult to type on. I have to write a lot for my job, and it was very difficult to use."
3,good,"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was odelivered on time as tracking information stated...The Buttons required much pressure to activate"
1,junk,it is easy to clean...that is it...typing at a regular speed is impossible. i hate this keyboard. you must two finger it and be very deliberate.Update: i still hate this keyboard...wpm went from 35-40 down to 6 or 7.
3,"Not like real thing, but not bad","(written whle using the product) When depressed, the keys can dropat 30degree angles so tht it does not recognize the strike. Yo really have to strike the key stright downward with 2x more force thn a regular keyboard. if you type with two fingers, its not too bad. but my smaller fingers (esp pinky) have a hard time with the force requirement and straight angle. I'vebeen using this keyboard exclusively for 1 week now and I stillcannt get it to work 100%. i use it for the super minilaptop while traveling, so the question fo me is does it feelbetter than a cramped keyboard ad the hassle of carrying this thing around?? Jury is still out..."
1,not what i was hoping for,this keyboard misses strokes....you have to practically pound the keys in order to guarantee that all of the letters you type actually show up. It slows your typing significantly.My keyboard on my laptop broke so i was only using it for a portable replacement....but it's pretty bad/unreliable.
2,"Good, but short.","Picked this DVD up at the Monster Jam Show in Worcester MA this weekend, got it home to find out it's only 71 minutes long across 2 DVD's, while the content was fantastic, seriously, 30 beans for just over an hour? you'd figure the way they are hyping the 30 year anniversary, there would be more content, more video of the Grave Digger trucks Racing, more something. the main documentary felt more like a bonus feature for another DVD, with a quick glossing over of the Legend and Red Mud Gravedigger moving onto the spooky paint job. Showing how the Paint job for the 30th anniversary truck was done was pretty awesome, but on the whole, the DVD Felt lacking.My advice, Skip for now, until the price drops, this DVD should have been in the $15 dollar range, short with very little content to keep my son occupied."
2,grave digger 30th annersary 2 dvd set,to short not worth the money for price of $30.00 wait on till it come down $15.00 dvd is junk you better off going to the movies than buying this dvd
4,"Great price and features, but one flaw!","The other reviewers have gone into great detail about this receiver and its tech specs. It packs a ton of features into a great price. We just built a new home, and our builder's A/V Installer recommended this unit highly (and at a price of $500).I want to point out one issue that hasn't been mentioned here or in the unit's paperwork.I decided to go all out and I bought digital interface cables to connect our DVD player, CD player, and satellite dish to the receiver. It worked well and the sound was great. Only problem is that the digital inputs DO NOT WORK with the multi-room sound. So, I get great sound in the primary room, but nothing (except the tuner) in the other rooms. Switch back to standard RCA cables and everything works in all rooms. The sound difference is barely noticeable (my wife says she doesn;t hear the difference).So, buy this receiver, but save your money and don't splurge for digital audio cables!"
2,Huh?,"In the introduction, the authors state that their thesis is that we've finally achieved a ""critical mass"" of computing power and have finally overcome the productivity paradox of the computer age. Unfortunately, the following chapters basically ramble on without direction and never address this origninal thesis."
2,"After you buy it, you're on your own...","My Toshiba Satellite lasted a little over a year before hardware began to fail (""blue screen of death"", CDR/W would no longer write, etc). Fortunately, the system came with system recovery disks (Symantic Ghost), but having to ghost the hard drive three times in the last two months seemed impractical. Device drivers are non-existant and Toshiba online support is pathetic - a constant, mindnumbing circle of useless websites.Definitely my last Toshiba... and this one is soon to be scrapped."
4,"Great Computer, bad hardrive (for me that is)","I've had this laptop for about three years now and I've only had problems with the hard drive. The first time it crashed and I sent it in for repairs and came back with it pretty good...or so I thought. About a year after, the hard drive crashed again and this time i just went and bought my own hard drive and now it's working fine. Dispite the mishap with the hard drive, everything else works perfectly. Now with the new harddrive the computer works like brand new, although i no longer am able to use the mini remote that comes along with it because this harddrive doesn't have all the toshiba featurs built in."
5,In a word: Sharp.,"Without hesitation, I can say that this knife is the sharpest I've ever used and I've a drawer full of very sharp blades. Cuts through tough vegetables like softened butter. The Shun Classic Nakiri is so sharp--in fact--it kind of scares me a bit. Yet, if fast, professional, kitchen prep is your thing, then this blade is the proverbial ""must have"", Any semi serious chief's toolkit won't be truly complete without this knife. The truth of this is revealed the first time you use it."
5,I Love Shun Knives and so does Alton Brown !!!!,"When it comes to chopping, slicing and mincing fresh produce,this is the knife I reach for. It is very sharp and easy to keep a edge with a ceramic honing rod. Shaped like a slender cleaver, it performs impeccably on everything from summer tomatoes to winter squashes. Forged from VG10 super steel clad with 16 microthin layers of high-carbon steel, the nakiri has a full tang to maximize strength and balance. Its unique D-shaped handle, made of resin-infused hardwood, is comfortable to grip and easy to control. It well worth the investment I'm Irish & Swedish so research and tried the knife at Sur La Table first.This is a YouTube Link of Food Star Alton Brown Talking about Shun Knives, Interesting to help you select and care of your knives: youtube.com /watch?v=lVCM5BfeA8c"
5,Shun Nakiri,"I have this knife with a steel handle, I assume that the blade is the same. The steel handle seems to be not available any longer on AMZ. Razor sharp, best vegi slicer in my kitchen! Also great for hard cheese and sausage. You have to use it to believe how it practically ""falls"" through a potato, sraight and true."
1,bad quality,I bought this knife in March and it is already falling apart. Pieces of the edge of the blade are breaking off. I use it specifically for chopping herbs. I wonder where the pieces of blade end up? I don't know if I just got a bad one or if they are just bad quality.
5,Great knife,Best vegetable knife we have ever had. Very sharp with no comparable blades. Would buy as a gift in the future for picky friends
5,Wow,"I just received this as a gift. I asked for it thinking it looked cool, and that it would be a good knife. After using it, I could care less how cool it looks. I own Some Wusthoh and JA Henckels and a set of Globals, and it isn't even close after one use.After I got done cooking and eating tonight's dinner I went back and cut up some more veggies just for fun. This knife cuts the thinnest of slices with seemingly no effort. I haven't tried anything very hard yet, and I have no idea how it will hold up, but my first use already makes this my favorite knife. I will update after I have used a bit more."
4,The use of story telling in a therapeutic manner with young people,"Clear, accessible and without jargon... this book will be a valuable tool for therapists, teachers, parents and others looking to develop alternative ways of communicating with children and young people.It makes so much sense, I wondered why I hadn't thought of it all myself !I also liked the print and the layout of the book."
2,"Great book, but once batteries go on you, can't replace.","This book has lasted in our house for 5 years! My older boys, now 8 and 5 absolutely loved this book and the cute animal sounds that it made (that weren't annoying in my opinion). But the batteries have gone dead on mine, and now my little 1 year old can't enjoy the sounds. I wrote to the address in the inside cover of the book where it said you could order ""replacement batteries"" and a little screwdriver, but the mail just came back to me with an ""undeliverable"" address. So beware, once your batteries go on it, you can't locate the little batteries anywhere, and you are just left with a 10 page picture book. If I could replace the batteries, I would give this book a 5 stars."
3,Interesting,"I thought that this was also a good book. I am going to order some of his other books. Ken Thomasma came to my school awhile ago, and the 4 that I own are autographed. I still enjoy reading them, even though I am 17."
3,The review of the Blackfeet tribe,"In the beginning the Blackfeet tribe is a warlike tribe, but no one ever attacks them. There is a boy named Om who wants to be a brave. He has a twin sister. When a baby falls off a cradle board Om's wise bird finds the baby. Om is the first one there. Everyone thinks Om found the baby so he gets his name changed to Om-kas-toe. His new name means swift as a deer and strong as a moose. In the end he gets his chance to be a brave by leading his braves against the snake braves."
1,Rust on an outdoor product,"I was truly impressed by the taut seating, the back support, the stability as they sit on the lawn- Until yesterday morning when I saw that everyone of the fastener heads is rusted. I e-mailed Coleman and await a reply but I'd discarded the boxes and the shipping papers. Why? Because of total faith in Coleman products based on past experience and reputation. This is an item intended for outdoor use in other that desert conditions I presume and it has rusted within two weeks. Yikes."
5,Great buy for people who are sizemically challenged,"I own this chair, and have used it every summer for at least 10 years. Have been looking for a place to buy one for a friend. Am delighted to find it here. Being a large person, I seldom subject myself to the usual camp-type chair for obvious and potentially embarrassing reasons. This beauty is light-weight, roomy, has rounded legs which won't sink into soft ground when sat upon. All-round great."
5,Coleman Captain's Chair is GR8!,"I ordered this chair because of some severe backand hip problems, and when I'm sitting at ringsideat dog shows, that makes the pain worse. Sincethis chair has much better support and a strongerstructure, it has worked great! I don't leaveit outside in the weather, so I don't know howwell it would fare outdoors ALL the time. I doknow it's GR8 for what I needed it for! It's light-weight, so I can manuever it without assistance,so I'm really glad that I decided to try it!It gets FIVE stars in my book, and I don't leavehome without it!!!"
5,Complete Guide to Prostate Cancer by Bostwick MD,"This work contains some brand new evaluative factors for prostate cancer. Examples of the factors are:- age- hormonal profile- race (lowest incidence in American Indians and highestincidence in Afro-Americans- diet- weight problems- occupationThe author spends some time describing the conditions precedentfor prostate cancer. The process starts with microscopic changes in the cellular lining of the prostate. Age plays a role in multiple cancers. The PSA elevation is the classic evaluative test followed by a biopsy of the prostate. There is a nerve sparing prostectomy for lower risk cancers. The high risk cancersmay require the radical retropublic prostatectomy.This work has a fairly comprehensive description of the currentdiagnostic approaches and treatments. Complementary and alternative medicinal approaches could be described for the benefit of the reading audience. Overall, the work will help patients discuss prostate issues intelligently."
2,Snoooorrrre.....go read Jenna Jameson's bio instead....,"Well I bought this book thinking that it would be as good as Jenna Jameson's biography but boy was I wrong. Not only is it overhyped, but if you like a dry, no-direction book, then go ahead and read it. I really got sick of hearing how big his you know what is, and all the situations he's been in. I only truly enjoyed the last chapter, which bared the soul of Ron Jeremy by telling us that he actually was in love and considered having a child. It is not worth paying full price for, even though mine was signed in person by Ron Jeremy."
2,Never read it.,I bought this for my husband and he has yet to read it. He said he tried a few times and then got bored. He did enjoy the pictures.
3,and an ego to boot...,I guess I expected more from the hedgehog...after all this book did receive extraordinary hype....but I don't feel it delivered...oh wella
1,Vomitville!,"Ron Jeremy always reminded me of one of those creepy,shady guys that are seen stalking around in malls and other public places,trying to hit on women and young teens.Just the image of this guy makes me wanna lose my breakfast,lunch and dinner,all in one spew.How this hairy,homely overweight pig ever made it into these smut movies is just way beyond me.Mr.Jeremy thinks he's got it made right now,with all of his money and so called ""fame"",or should I say SHAME.But,it's just a pity that he won't be able to take all that cash with him when he's dead and stands before God with his sin-ful self.Just remember...any fool can have sex.Just like any fool can get drunk.Not much of a talent."
3,Hit and Miss,"Closer to 3.5 / 5, but that wasn't an option.Enjoyable and entertaining at first, but begins to drag a bit towards the end. He comes off surprisingly likeable overall, but rambles way, way too much about famous people that he knows, to the point of it becoming annoying. I zoomed through it in less than 24 hours, so it was a quick read, and mostly enjoyable with a lot of quick, random stories and fluff. Definitely some parts that I wish were more in depth. Worth checking out if it at all piques your interest, I'd say."
2,mildly entertaining,"I had picked this book up in the store and must have opened to the only funny page in the book. Instead, I found that the book did not flow well. As other reviewers have noted, Ron spent too much time trying to convince his readers that porn stars are actors and actresses. Early on in the book, Ron stated that he has a masters degree. I would expect the book to be better written based on that bit of knowledge. It reads as if it were written by a [...]boy."
5,Ron's book - great pics!,"I especially enjoyed the great photos in the book by the photographer called Dirty Bob - great work, DB!"
3,Ron Jeremy,"Interesting but kind of nauseating. In my opinion this book tries to glorify porn, but to me it's just a very sleezy industry - I really don't even know why I read it, however, the book was written well, and I do beleive Mr. Jeremy sold him self out and ultimately this book details his reasons why."
3,Leaving me confused...,"This is a strange old book. In a way it is funny, full of anecdotes that make you smile or blush. Inother way it taste some sadness in the book. It gives me the feeling of a man who sees himself as being a faillure, just as an underlying feeling i got from the book. Too hard he tries to be something that he is not, a mainstream actor. His constant name dropping is a little embarrasing. As well, you cant help feeling sorry for him in a way, as he has been sidelined and overstepped by a few people.Still it gets 3 stars as it is entertaining and I read the book in one sitting and can recommend it as what it is a decent read."
4,great read,Great read. It's amazing how some people live and a great way to live vicariously through another person.
3,Ron Jeremy Loves Ron Jeremy - Literally,"Bottomline is Ron Jeremy says he is the greatest porn star of all time and there is no one that he does not know. He is in the thick of everything celebrity in Hollywood. There is not a porn act that he has committed and not a stone has he left unturned. There are many pictures in the book which is the book's saving grace. Otherwise, it is not that good, but not that bad. If you want to read about the porn business and his involvement in it and his friendship with Sam Kinison and other celebrities it is a fairly good read. You will have to read it in order to find out how much Ron loves himself. It is something I would rather not write up in this review..."
2,Ron Jeremy was much more interesting to me before I read this book,"To me, Ron Jeremy epitomized the role of everyman, he's not in shape, not very good looking, yet he gets boat loads of tail and gets paid for it! Going into this book I thought it would be filled with sorded tales of celebrity sexcapades and ""behind closed doors"" type stories. Instead what I got was chapters filled with relentless name dropping and Ron's sob story about trying to break into mainstream acting. Here's a hint Ronny, Porn stars NEVER break into mainstream acting roles unless you count cameos or comic relief. Instead of choosing roles wisely like most actors with any talent do, Ron just goes through life accepting every low level, piece of garbage role he was offered. In a way I still admire him for getting paid to do what every man dreams of, but on the other hand I feel sorry for him because he is basically pigeon-holed in the fat porn star role for life."
5,A Must Read!,"As an educator who has taught in ""well-run diverse schools,"" I am grateful for Ms. Kugler's important book. Not only does she address, head-on, the myths that poison our thinking about today's diverse public schools but she also articulates the truths which ought inform our decisions about our childrens' schooling. Most importantly, she presents powerful models to those of us who would ""reap the rich harvest of our diverse schools."" Eileen Kugler has done a tremendous service to public education by writing this book."
3,NOT AWFUL FOR THE PRICE,"I have had this guitar for over a year now. Forgot to review it until the recent amazon prompt today. It's just okay. Nothing fabulous. I have several guitars and have owned many previously, including electric. This one is definitely for beginners, which is fine. The sound does seem to go with the intent in the brand NAME. Good for your first acts AT HOME. Great price, not a terrible sound. Could've done worse. It hangs on the wall mostly and looks cool with the decor. I play my others for better sound. P.S. Use an amp of excellent quality from a more renound name. Helps a BIT."
1,my 2 censt on laces,"Funny you should ask. Each of the two laces broke the first time I tied my shoes.So, it was a TOTAL waste for me.I then had to buy new ones at $4.00 each from a shoe repair shop.I would drop this item. Not at the Amazon quality needed."
2,color is not as pictured,"The laces I received are very dark brown, almost black. They do not have any gold as mentioned in the text nor do they have any or light tan or rich brown tones as shown in the picture of the laces."
5,Most underrated band around.,"Seriously, this may be one of the best things to happen in rock music for years and no one even pays any attention to these guys. They're too busy listening to their Panic! at the Disco songs. The Dear Hunter's writing is so great, and Casey's vocals are just great. He has a great voice and really knows how to use it. He brings in so many influences from so many styles. They even manage to fit a section into ""The Lake and the River"" that sounds like, for lack of a better term, slave music. Listen to this band right now because stuff this good is hard to come by."
3,Wasn't so impressed:(,"II do enjoy their intricate style that they are able to play. The group is able to play in different times. One of my favorite songs is off their first CD ""City Escape"". What I have the hardest time with is reading the lyrics along and without the music, and have the line mesh well. I'm not able to understand what the songs is about. But like one of the reviews already posted....give it some time and the songs(music) will catch in your head, I really am not to found of the lyrics....and without the lyrics in hand it is really hard to understand what he is saying much less the meaning behind it."
4,I heart Lynn Freed.,"I saw Ms. Freed do a reading and I just had to get some of her books. Home Ground showcases her warm, witty voice. This is an engrossing story of girlhood and coming-of-age with a heroine who's a bit of a holy terror. A very good read."
4,Autobiography from a fascinating novelist,"Lynn Freed offers a portrait of growing up in privileged South Africa in Home Ground.This is a loving and merciless view of a theater family made up of three parts histrionic narcissists, two parts evaders, and one part Lynn. Freed is also merciless concerning her own abuses of power in South Africa as a child, the lines she thoughtlessly steps over to explore and satisfy her drives. No excuses, just the events, leaving the reader to draw her own conclusions about the ""why."" The lack of justification or complaint is refreshing in a memoir.Freed creates very real people for her readers, but just as real is her gift for conveying beautiful, exotic settings in all their fullness; the clothes, furnishings, the light, what grows outside a window, the sounds that drift in that same window.Recommended especially for fans of Freed's novels, who will appreciate the insight into the politics of race, colonialism and gender that fuel her fiction."
3,MAYBE NOT THE BEST...,"I bought this item with the slide check option, but when it arrived I had to assemble the parts myself, I don't have a real complaint about that, but they should advertise it like that.When I played the first time it started to leak after 300 rounds or more throught the oring wasting my air, I checked it out and the oring was ok, so it beats me...Either way, maybe is not the best but at least works."
4,Gioacco,It is much easier to take this in the pill form. Taking them as a multi-pill dosage makes sure you drink enough water/fluid with them.
3,Changes in my use,"While I have used I fo years, I have been told by doctors that it causes gas;, therefore I use Citrucel ."
4,uplifting,"(Don't let the number of stars fool you. I only give the Bible a five. Four means I would *buy* this one.)This is a fun read that is very upbeat. I have read it three times, checking it out of the library, and each time come away feeling better about the world. Good things can happen, even in a yucky future!Linc (short for Lincoln?) really overcomes an awful background. Nice!"
2,Superb lyrics and music - lifeless sound,"No doubt, these lyrics and music are superb; after all, this is why I purchased this CD. What wonderful memories! But, this particular CD's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless. I didn't intend for this CD to be simply background music, as I like to become ""drawn into"" the recording, but that's all I can do. What a disappointment!I have ordered many wonderful CD's from Amazon that sound great, but felt compelled to write and warn others.I give this CD at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music, but only a 1-star for it's sound quality. With engineering like this, its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the Internet rather than make a purchase."
2,Superb music - botched mastering,"Classic music...some of the best of the era! The compositions, arrangements, and performances are extraordinary. But, as is typical of '80s mastered CDs, this one, too, is very low in levels (loudness) compared to today's CDs, and anything below about 200Hz is rolled off severely (lacking in bass). Total time: 35 minutes."
4,Cute and impressive effort!,"I purchasedFrench Bulldogs: Lightweights LittermatesandDachshunds: Lightweights Littermatestogether, as gifts... I flipped through them prior to sending them off to their final recipient and was pleased to find that the photography and composition was appealing to my tastes. Sharon Montrose's composition skill is what sets these photos out from the rest. I like the bold imagery. And having tried to take pictures of my own pets, I know it's a VERY tough experience to have them pose... they're curious little creatures. My 1-star off of the review is pretty much for repetitiveness; the concept is fresh to begin with, but it gets boring, real fast."
4,Made me a joe pace fan,"Up until this point I had not really been a Joe Pace fan. I'm a fan of church shoutin' and rockin and rollin choirs and Joe seemed a lil tame for me...well I picked up this CD because Lowell Pye from Men of Standard is featured on 4 tracks. If you're a John P Kee and New Life Community Choir fan then you know who Lowell Pye is. Needless to say Hallelujah Anyhow, Glad About it and Mighty Long Way are the gems of this album. Lowell shows you how talented he is and that he can stand alone and shout with anyone. This man is truly annointed.Some reviewers were upset that there is not a lot of new material on here....which is true....but I like the live versions much better and in the case of hallelujah anyhow and glad about it...they are really taken to the next level with the new arrangement."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,This is not what I was expecting. Disk 1 & 2 have songs from previous albums. I do like the way he has remixed the songs.Not Happy.
5,love it,"I have two toddlers who wear the same size shoe except my son has fat chubby toddler feet and my daughter narrow. They fit both of them great!! i like these better than regular crocs because they stay on MUCH better. The elastic is neoprene like a wet suit so it has a lot of give and is nice and squishy, so ive had no problems with blisters or anything. I have camo and purple and and debating on buying the blue and pink :) And the kids love the fact they can put them on themself and can run hard and play hard and there is no indication of that on the shoes, no scuffs or scratches."
3,Be careful with sizing,"I recently ordered the Cameo Crocling. I love this style and am having a hard time finding it. I just wanted to mention my experience being that I think the sizing is confusing based on how the selection is set up above on Amazon. The XL, XXL, and XXXL should be at the other end of the list, they are big shoes. Since they were listed first I thought they fell into the 10/11 & 12/13 of a smaller kids shoe. [...] wasn't much help and now I am left paying for the return. Overall this is the only Croc I will buy since they stay on my kids feet."
1,Front brake circuit failure,Filled and per-primed on the bench. Installed/bled and front brake circuit would not apply enough pressure to the calipers to stop some one from spinning the tire by hand with brakes applied. Complete failure out of the box.
2,The Lost Continent,Rather mundane descriptive work. It is outdated by a quarter century. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,An enjoyable reference not just for editors,"If you are one of those people who actually care about your writing, then this book is for you. I picked up a copy recently at a bookstore and I've browsed through most of it. I'm embarrassed to say that I found a few words that I had been using incorrectly!I don't know if I'd really use this book over a 'real' dictionary, but I would definitely consider it if I'm unsure of a definition or the proper usage of a word. I expect that I'll be reviewing this book occasionally to make sure that there isn't some word that I'm slipping up on.If you are self conscious and concerned about your writing, then pick up this valuable resource. I guarantee you'll be able to find something in the book that you haven't been using properly or misspelling (if that's not the case, then congratulations)."
4,English and its Foibles,"Bill Bryson's dictionary is a wonderful frolic through the foibles of the English language. The misused, the misunderstood and even the mis-spelled are treated with great humour and insight.Many people will choose to randomly browse through ""Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words"". I chose the option of reading it cover to cover. Either way, the book cannot fail to both entertain and inform.Unlike French, English is a work in progress with no bureaucracy trying to stifle change. An institution in the style of the French Academy is unthinkable for English. Indeed, herein lies the strength of English and the basis of its ability to continually re-invent itself and evolve through time. French, by way of comparison, looks increasingly like the fly stuck in amber.Bryson is a highly observant wordsmith and his book should be read by all those who cherish English and its marvelous journey."
4,"Good Book, but Not Ideal for Kindle","I got the Kindle version of this book, which I wouldn't recommend, while I recommend the book itself as a good resource. It's never a good idea to get this kind of reference book on a Kindle, because it's a pain to go back and look for a specific reference, which is normally how you'd use it. Having said that, I found it really enlightening. Bryson doesn't just cover words that are easily confused or frequently misused, he also points out facts about various subjects--geography, biology, politics, etc.-- that people often mistakenly assume. I was embarrassed to find that I was completely wrong about the capitol of Australia for who knows how many years (Canberra!). I find that breadth of coverage keeps my interest up and his tone is humorous and not painfully didactic like other books of this type. I'm planning to get this in a paperback, as I expect I'll refer to it repeatedly in the future."
2,Obsolete,"Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words may have been useful twenty-five years ago, when it was first published, but it has become redundant. Most entries clarify word spellings and meanings, which a normal dictionary does just as well (with the advantage that it lists all words, not an arbitrary selection). A Google or Yahoo search will instantly clarify the rest, such as corporate names. Grammatical or stylistic advice is rarely given, and adds little to Strunk & White's better-organised and clearer The Elements of Style. And because of the dictionary format, that advice is buried in distant entries and hard to find. Nor does Bryson's manual lend itself to reading `like a novel', even if he wrote it with his customary humour. This is most likely to sit on your shelf."
4,Nice read - maybe not the book for those who know some Latin or French,"This book covers a range of words that tend to get misspelled or misused in English publications. Many of them are words of French or Latin origin, which makes them a problem only for those who did not have to take one of these languages in school. The last chapter in the book is dedicated to punctuation - and that one is really helpful for any reader."
4,Excellent idea which desires a lot more attention,"I enjoyed this book very much, it revealed a lot of background information about the English language. I found only one shortcoming: it is too short... please, go ahead and write a lot more like this."
4,Useful and informative,"A great little instruction book for aspiring horror writers, and I do mean little, it only runs about 108 pages. Most of it's contents are aimed at writing a horror novel, but there's also some handy info about writing children's horror novels and short stories. Say what you will about it's author, it's advice is succinct but helpful and while it's geared towards authors in the UK, writer's of all nationalities will benefit from it's advice. Recommended."
5,Really Fresh,"Our pumpkin seeds arrived on June 29, 2011. The code on our bags is 1441148, which means the production date is May 24, 2011. It's amazing how it goes from production to my hands in a bit over a month. The pumpkin seeds indeed look and smell fresh. In fact, the aroma and taste are really intense. I'm so used to Trader Joe's and Whole Food's pumpkin seeds that are drier and probably older. (Unfortunately, my local Trader Joe's stopped selling organic pumpkin seeds and Whole Foods is so expensive that I needed to find something more affordable.) After I open a new bag, I leave it open to dry a bit. We are probably losing some nutrition, but it does improve the taste while keeping them raw.The Amazon webpage only says, ""Processed in a facility which uses peanuts and other nuts."" The back of the package says, ""May contain wheat, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, milk"". The pumpkin seeds are probably processed in a facility that processes wheat, soy, and milk too."
3,Not for everyone,"I suspect that raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas) are better for you than roasted and salted, but evidently it is an acquired taste. Unlike some raw pumpkin seeds at the health food store, they are not bitter. But I have to mix in 25% roasted and salted for me to like eating them.Unlike the illustration, they are the same green color as the raw ones you see in the health food store."
4,Raw pumpkin seeds,These are fresh and delicious raw pumpkin seeds. This is a good deal compared to our local grocery store. Highly recommend.
3,Good news - bad news !!,"First the good one : The holy grail of many progressive rock fans is available on cd now. Fantastic music, great players !!Now the bad news : There has not been any remastering. The sound of Go and Go Too is quite OK, but the audio quality of Live from Paris is horrible, quite like a seventies bootleg. Sounds like it is copied from an old, scratchy LP !Why that ? What about the original tapes ? Shame on raven !!"
5,Fusion Lovers Dream,"I got this Cd over a recomendation of a friend of mine who told me it was very good and with that line up I was very curious about it. Al Dimeola who needs no introduction, Steve Winwood from Traffic, German Electronica pioneer Klaus Schulze (Cosmic Jokers, Tangerine Dream), Ex Santana's drummer Michael Shrieve contributes with Stomu Yamashta in this really mind blowing Space/Fusion/Jazz/Rock stravaganza that makes this CD a must. Highly recommended"
3,Legendary,"For all of you who cannot grasp the sure sensationality of this, think again....Okay, maybe the re-production of this may not be up to speed, but you must rememeber this was done before most of you were born and without saying, one of the most brilliant recordings ever done. Then, we have a super-house of compositions into the world of some very far-reaching sonic excursions not heard since 1976. I have the vinyls, all of them, and with out doubt, this is sensational recorded history of one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken with a host of legendary composers, notwithstanding, a brilliant spread of musical tapestry not found often in the world of contempory music and Al DiMeola delivers a myriad of tasty guitar solo's that would make Jimi Hendrix roll over in his grave... So, when I tell you this should be in your CD collection, make it so, if not, then find something else better to listen to............highly recommended"
2,"I don't own this set--however, I have a burning question:","Why are three of the best animated films (IMHO) STILL not in widescreen format on DVD??? The scenery in Balto is beautiful and deserves to be viewed in its entirety. And also, on the cover of the American Tail DVD, Fievel's sister Tanya looks nothing like the way she did in the 1986 film. She looks more like she did in the sequel, Fievel Goes West, from 1991. I'm really surprised they haven't released a decent 20th anniversary edition of this film yet, and hope they do with Land Before Time as well instead of these ""smiley-happy-fun-time for kids"" editions. (And of course, there were some scenes in the above movies that were not ""smiley-happy-fun-time"")"
5,By far the best on the market,"These are easy to disassemble for the dishwasher, they don't leak and they are easy to put back together. All around the best I've found."
1,TERRIBLE SELLER!!!!,"WARNING - DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT YOU WANT OR ORDERED!!!! BEWARE - IF YOU HAVE A SON AND ORDER THE ONE WITH THE SOCCER BALLS AND SO ON, EXPECT TO GET ONE THAT IS PINK WITH FLOWERS. WHAT IN THE HECK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT? I ENDED UP THROWING IT IN THE TRASH. CERTAINLY MY SON DID NOT WANT IT. I CAN UNDERSTAND COLORS BEING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BUT COMPLETE PATTERNS?!!!! AND THEY ARE NOT HELPFUL OR VERY NICE WHEN YOU WANT TO RETURN THE PRODUCT!!!"
5,Geoff Johns is a mad genius,"Is nothing more compelling than the JSA?? I mean come on! This book is so sweet, I got diabetes from reading it!"
5,JSA FANS,My grandson loved it! He is 12 and a fan of JSA. Eagerly anticipating his ability to purchase Vol. 5.
4,JSA: book 3,good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly..
1,better dead than live,"These live recordings of the slits are pretty awful, even by punk standards. The music plods and Ari, lead singer, sounds ghastly, like she doesn't know what to do with the mike. A very disappointing (& I would say exploitative) CD."
2,Length is an issue,"I recently purchased the bathrobe specifically because of the long length. However, after washing it, it shrunk up almost 12 inches. There were no washing instructions. Although cotton terry cloth does shrink in hot water and the drier, it should not have shrunk that much. The sleeves are barely long enough whereas before washing they could actually be cuffed. It's a beautiful bathrobe, but don't count on having a long bathrobe for long."
1,Picture Ad is a fraud,The picture in the ad for this product shows a specially long robe which is hard to find in the internet.But when I got the robe it was not like in the picture...it berely goes below the knee and is not as long as in the picture.I even purchased the extra large size... even tho my size is just large.This company is missrepresenting its product with false picture ads.
3,Fine,"This robe is a medium-weight fabric, length to the calves on an average woman. Wife likes it, and daughter made off with it, claiming it as her own. Not a high-end piece, but fine."
3,Not as advertised!,"The robe arrived only 3 days after I placed the order, very good. However, when I opened the package I thought they had sent the wrong item since it only came to mid calf on me, I'm 5'3. I ordered the largest size in order to get the 50 inch lenght it was described as. I intend to use it as an actual bathrobe when I come out of the shower and expected it to go ankle lengt on me. It actually measures only 46 inches, a big difference, very disappointing. Also, it is not very soft. I'm not returning it because I don't want the hassle and it is functional, but will not order from this seller in future."
2,IT'S HUGE,It is soft but I swim in it every morning. I am 5.6 and 140lbs and there is room for two of me in that robe. Would not buy again. definitely not a one size fits all situation.
4,Plush Terry Robes,"These robes are thick and luxurious. I was happy to see this as I was looking for 14 oz. terry and the weight of the fabric was not specified in the description. I am a tall person, so I would have appreciated a few more inches in length. An XL would have been to large in all of the other dimensions. Overall-A very nice robe."
4,Check out the Manufacturer's Website,"If you want more details, ordering options, and possibly discounts on these robes, I HIGHLY recommend that you check out the manufacturer's website at [...]They have higher quality photos there, as well as more information on embroidery colors and styles.Try putting the robe you want in your cart there and checking if you get a deal or if the ordering process works better for you.I was pleasantly surprised."
3,Warming up my husband,"First of all; I had to wash it...it weighs at least 15-20 pounds wet and took two days to hang dry (on a wooden hanger). Then I had to sew the little loop in the back of the collar for hanging it up back on...as much as this cost I should not have had to do that before it was ever worn. It was a Christmas gift and I didn't want to take the time to have to ship it back. I asked my husband today how he likes his new Robe...""It is really heavy"" was his reply and he didn't have a happy face when he said it. BUT it is warm right? Yip~ he said. The sleeves are long enough right? Yip~ he said. So it works. Still think I paid too much."
2,horrible quality...,I washed it once and turned it inside out. a lot of the threads up the sleeves were coming off up the seam and undone. The thing sheds A LOT when you wash it. Clogged my sink strainer multiple times in one rinse cycle. I would have expected better quality for $100
5,Excellent On All Levels!,"The robe was great, very fast shipping, and packaged nicely w/ a hand written thank you note. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
3,Sizing issue,"It ran a bit smaller than I expected. However the material of the robe is very nice. If I was to order again, I would order a size up in order to have a more comfortable fit."
4,Great Bathrobe,"The fit was just what I had in mind for my 6'4"" frame. The wrong color was sent, but I kept it anyway."
5,I love this robe!,"Last year, I bought my then-fiance one of these robes for Christmas. I love to use this thick and thirsty robe, and so does my then-fiance and now husband. It shipped promptly and I had it just in time for Christmas last year!!"
1,Too big and snags easily.,The robe is plush as advertised but the cloth frayed easily. I washed it after it arrived and it frayed immediately -- at the seams and on the material itself. I have ten year old towels with less snags than this robe had in one wash. And one size does NOT fit all. The company is a very good company to work with and I received a refund with no questions asked. I would buy from then again.
3,daveinutah,"when I first received the robe I was very pleased. It seemed to live up to all the positive things I had read about it. Very nice. However, the first time that I washed it, a section of one of the seams about a foot long came apart and frayed. Very disappointing. I realize that even in the best of merchandise, there will be an occasional flaw. Nevertheless, it is what it is......3 stars...(It would have been 5)"
2,I ordered a bathrobe but got a tent.,"The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge. It was more like a tent than a bathrobe. It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18. I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)."
4,"Great men's robe, but not really for ladies","Its comfy and practical, but not asthetically pleasing enough to suit women unless they just want something to frump around in."
3,Terry Bathrobe 100% Cotton,"The weight and feel of the robe is great.However,customers should be cautioned to buy larger than needed size. After washing,the robe shrunk and does not fit nearly as well."
5,Luxurious Robe,"I'm very thorough about researching gifts for people. After a couple days of reviewing everything I could find I ordered this robe for my wife for Christmas. I was a little concerned about getting the right size as this robe didn't offer sizes. But no worries, it's big enough for a man, but soft enough for a woman. She loves it. She says it is what she would expect from a luxury spa.The shipping was a little slow, but it was Christmas time. I did get it in time for Christmas though, so no complaint. There was a hand-written note; a nice touch in this day and age.When I need another robe, I'll just buy it right here and not shop around again."
5,Comfy and warm,"I got this for my husband, and he loves it! He says it is very comfortable and warm for going around the house. I would recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great robe and quick delivery,I ordered this robe yesterday and it arrived today. Could not believe how thick and soft it feels. Great buy recommend to all. Great gift idea for any occasion.
5,Excellent Quality Item,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. It is thick, soft and she loves it. Came on time with a handwritten thank you note.It is quite heavy but she likes it and even in the Texas summer isn't too hot."
4,It's a good gift,"I got this gift for someone for the holiday. It looks like the basic traditional white bathrobe. This robe wraps around a well figure women, absorbs water great and has held up since it's been washed a few times now. The person I bought this for loves it! all they wanted was a basic white none girly robe."
5,Great robe very plush and absorbent,I love the robe . It fits perfect. It is very soft and absorbent. Very soft great value. Would recommend
5,"Love this heavy, luxurious, well-made robe!","The price was right, the order came quickly, it was the perfect size (Sm) hitting mid-calf for my 5'5"" frame, and it has the heavy weight I was looking for"
5,At last a real Turkishtowel robe,"I ordered the large robe (in Taupe) to get the added length. I had been looking for an all-cotton Turkish robe because what I could find locally were only synthetic textiles - high static. This robe is exactly what I hoped for. It is long (to my ankles - I'm 6') but not overly loose. It does feel heavy (5lbs) but that's fine. I also like that the sleeves, although large, don't drag on the ground like a kimono (i.e. are not awkward)."
3,Soft but not very absorbent,"This towel feels wonderful...when you're not wet. It's super soft, but it doesn't absorb water as well as terrycloth robes I've used. It actually makes me feel colder when I put it on after I shower. I use robes because I hate being wet and cold, so I wasn't exactly pleased with it."
3,Too small for sizing presented,"I love this robe. Only issue is for an xl, I am an l, is it is a bit too tight when belted. Needed to a little wider."
5,Excellent,"This CD is a good companion of music for Veterans of WW2, Korea, and Viet Nam. As a chaplain, it gives comfort to them when placed in permanent facilities to live out their last weeks and months."
5,A book of poetry that reads like a novel,"This book of Michelle Tea's poems published previously in chapbook form is a breathless collection of her experiences. Many of them allude to circumstances and people found in her other books, placing the poems within familiarity. Her poems are gripping and fiercely feminist, unapologetic in their honesty. Towards the end, several poems tend to mention writing poems, choosing to honor Tea's reality but losing some of the emotional immediacy for me as a reader. Still the poems are deeply passionate and definitely worth delving into if you are a fan of Michelle Tea's other work."
3,Use with caution,"While SurvivalCat can produce minimal comfort in an emergency, it is necessary to let the unit burn for at least 5 minutes outside to eliminate oderous exhaust emitions and heat up fully. While catalytic heaters produce minimal CO2, they deplete oxygen, and some venting is important for fresh oxygen. The kit is basic survival only. The valve system is somewhat confusing at first. The wire stand is difficult to use. For pleasure camping I would choose a more expensive unit."
1,Not impressed,"I am returning this heater. Went to Mendocino this weekend, not a very cold trip but we tried it in the morning. Two veteran campers couldn't figure out if it was lit. When we finally did, it put out a scant amount of heat. We left it on for a while hoping it would increase but it did not."
5,"Easy to use, no problems","Nice camcorder for price. The audio sounds fine to me. Zoom is excellent. I connected the camera using firewire to my DVD recorder and it works great, very simple. I am able to easily make copies to DVD of what we created. The onscreen guide is farily easy to navigate through to find what you are looking for. If you want to be able to film and then transfer to DVD, I highly recommend this camera along with buying a DVD recorder, much easier than using a PC. Prices on DVD recorders are now very affordable."
2,too much motor noise!,"It has many attractive features for the price ...so I just ordered this and totally disappointed with audionoise. The motor makes too much noise and the built-inmic picksup that noise. The ""audio"" is important componentof any recording, I just can't stand a stupid ""humming"" noise,so this is getting returned. JVC, what were you thinking ????"
4,"Fun for grown-ups, too.","I ran across a lady who had one of these and could not tune it. I brought it home to tune for her. My husband picked it up, along with one of the song sheets and played a song. He has always liked the thought of playing music, but never been able to. He liked that one so much that we ordered one for him. I contacted First Act and requested that they look into providing more song sheets. It may or may not happen. So, I traced the shape of the song sheet onto a piece of paper. Then, I made light lines where the strings would cross. This I scanned into my computer and printed onto card stock. I have used these to work out several more songs for him to play. He likes my versions better than the originals."
4,fun harp,"When the harp arrived, it was very out of tune. We used a piano as a reference to tune it and since then it has been working fine. The song cards lets my 6-year-old play songs she knows. She really enjoys playing it."
3,Gave as gifts and both had to be tuned.,"I gave these as gifts to friends...senior adults....and both of themhad to be tuned (they had to get a musician) to do it. Should have cometuned. Otherwise, they are happy."
2,Looking for something ahead of time,"Mr. Ranlet is a good writer and his book is an easy read. He also did gather a good amount of documents.However, his book ignores some available documents and many first person accounts that would cast shadows on his findings. He also chooses not to place emphasis on sources that counter his view, while accepting almost all that would support his arguement.It is obvious that he wrote this book with a conclusion in mind rather than searching for an answer. I do not place that much into his findings as it seems to go against most other historical findings that have been published in many other books."
3,"great pictures, atrocious writing","A very handsome book that doesn't appear to've been copyedited at all. The first five pages have more grammatical errors than any ten randomly selected novels. Plus, author Jeff Kurtti's tortured prose stylings seem better suited to a grade 12 english class than a ""quality"" mass market publication. Still, excellent pictures, an attractive layout, and some good and interesting quotes from the key creatives, albeit rammed bone-headedly in between all the intermittently coherent Kurtti-text. Buy it to look at, not to read."
5,"Visual insights, art & insider's info abound!","This collector's edition of A Bug's Life deserves ongoing mention is a fun accompaniment to the film, requiring good reading skills or parental assistance but pairing film clips with an outline of the story. Visual insights, art and insider's info abound."
3,The Art of A Bugs Life,Nice Book. A little bit of damage. But what do you expect from a second hands book?
1,Lovely Nolly - Boring Movie,"I bought the movie under the belief this movie is going to be scarry. Whew I was wrong. I found this movie to be just plain tedious and an absolute bore. Nothing ever really happened. Plain and simple, the character is a sociopath. Hmmm, where we seen this before, snooze. A few times the movie had glimmers of something scarry ( paranormally speaking ) but crash, it leads NO were. About half way through the movie I was so disappointed, no good effects with a crap budget and no real eye catching scenes. I dont understand why other people like this snoozer of a movie. It is so typical of the current trend of hearing sudden noises or weird noises in a dark house, whew I'm wetting in my pants and covering my eyes , can we say Paranormal Activity number who gives a hoot rip off. Oh, well I guess the ole saying goes here 'Different Strokes for Different Folks'."
2,Lovely Molly...,The name of this movie doesn't do it any justice.I really didn't think the movie was scary at all...more like a rip off to get your money.
3,Lovely Molly...good story,The movie had a good story. Parts of it were hard to follow. The home video approach is not my favorite and it was too sexually graphic for my taste.
4,better than I expected...,"I watch just about every horror/ thriller that comes out and I must say I am usually disappointed. There are very few that I really enjoy anymore. This movie was actually better than I expected. The storyline is good and the acting is better than most of the recent horror films I have seen at the theaters. It moves along well too, no slow spots. Worth a watch if you like this genre."
4,From the mastermind of the Blair Witch another disturbing tale,"I rented this movie not knowing what it was about and I was really glad. Eduardo Sanchez is brilliant in his telling of creepy and disturbing tales. While this is no academy award winner, if you like horror movies this would be a good bet."
1,Absolutely awful.,"If you don't heed my two thumbs down for this train wreck of a film and decide to see it anyway, PLEASE comment to this review and tell me what the heck was going on in this movie! I could not understand the ""plot"" at all, and the acting and screenplay were so ridiculously bad, I didn't see any point in trying to figure what this mess was about."
2,"""Lovely Molly"" Is Pretty Awful","{Really about 1.5 stars}""Lovely Molly"" springs from the same director who brought us ""Blair Witch Project,"" and employs the same ""found footage"" cinematography utilized in ""BWP."" Although it's a totally different story than ""BWP,"" several scenes are shamelessly derivative from that highly original and truly frightening film. I pride myself on being open-minded and respectful of others' tastes, but still, there's just nothing new here, folks. I simply can't imagine why anyone would consider this a particularly good flick. If you like to dim all the lights and be frightened, and the same old stuff--footsteps, eerie voices, and so forth--still does it for you, then ""Lovely Molly"" may be worth it. Gretchen Lodge (Molly) and Johnny Lewis (her husband) play their roles quite well and are pretty convincing, and yes, Lodge does take her clothes off (several times), which will be justification enough for some. Otherwise. . .?"
2,One good moment...,"I won't say this movie is terrible, because there's some good acting and I like that the writer brought addiction and psychosis together in a horror film; however, the story is all over the place and never really makes sense. It's a pretty big let-down except for about 30-seconds of this one ""kissing"" scene, which had me squirming almost off my couch. But even that scene was ruined before it could end, and its gravity was completed negated by the following scene. As an avid lover of this genre, I'm glad I got to see the 30-seconds that did make my stomach turn, but for most moviegoers, it's probably a bust."
2,Weird and Unexplained,"This movie 1) made no sense, 2) the primise was last in the beginning, 3) wasn't very realistic. I don't get the horse head thing or if the chic was trippen. The end is even worst because the sister starts in acting like the crazy sister. Who's crazy :(Won't say it's a time waster but I'm not buying this at all. Acting was interesting, lets just say typical decisions made - not lighting, no action on the families part. Weird but interesting."
4,Pretty Interesting,"The acting is not bad, it looked pretty scary, I know some scenes were a little disturbing, but it was still good, Molly, the main character, she was pretty creepy, some scenes with her seemed pretty suspenseful, and dramatic. When she was possessed, it kind of scared me, a few times the movie feels a little slow, but it was pretty scary, 3.95/5 stars."
1,awful,"awful.just awful.really, really awful.I love horror, and this was a complete waste of money.boo boo boo"
4,Interesting taste. Though may not be for everyone.,"The taste is odd. Its like a dry, custard-y like flavor in the middle of a soft marshmallow.Personally i enjoyed this and shared it with 5 other people, of which 2 enjoyed it.Not sure if its really worth the steep price thoughI would recommend this unless you are one of those people who HAS to try things they havent tried yet, as its not a particularly unique taste or food experience, and you could miss out or find something better @ the price."
5,I love these!!,"I've already gone through them and ordered more, they are that addicting. You can taste the pudding and it works really well with the marshmallow. It's not overly sweet either. I love them!!! *^^*"
4,IRS Practice and Procedure (Tax Series),"IRS Practice & Procedure, Revised Second Edition, is an invaluable reference addressing the rapidly changing and increasingly complex area of tax procedure. This well-regarded authority can be a practitioner's single most important tool to understanding the procedural changes, IRS restructuring, and ongoing revision of the Internal Revenue Manual."
5,wonderful Advent calendar!,this is the best Advent calendar i've found because each day has a wonderful kid-friendly devotion about the birth of Jesus and events leading up to it. I highly recommend it!
2,Not calendar style,"I just assumed the days were going to be set up like a calendar which is what I needed for my 2 and 5 year olds. Something that they can use to count down. Instead, the little books inside aren't set up in numerical order. I'm actually not quite sure how the publisher decided to set them up the way they are. The little books are different shapes and sizes.The stories in the books are nice. The concept is nice. But I would recommend this for older kids. It's not for kids who need a calendar set up to count down the days."
3,Fun idea but embellished,"We got the book because my wife had it growing up. It's a fun concept and fun for the daughter to participate in, but the storyline has been freely embellished beyond the biblical record."
3,You get what you pay for,I received a damaged cover but did not contact seller because the item was inexpensive and it was not worth the hassle to return it. I wanted this item by Dec. 1 in coincide with the beginning of advent.
1,WARNING: Not Biblically Accurate,"These books are very loosely based on the Bible account of Christ's birth. This is definitely not something to use for any age child if you want to share the truth about Christ. We were very disappointed to see the multiple liberties taken including: added miracles, naming of the wise men (who appeared at the stable and prophesied to multitudes) and angels appearing not only to the shepherds but also to entire villages and towns for miles around. Please do not be fooled by their appearance and do not expect to be able to use them as a historical or Biblical account of Christ's birth."
3,Did not Follow the Christmas Story,"It thought this was a very fun idea! I enjoyed hanging them on the tree and going through advent. When we read the stories we found they were not Biblical, and a little strange. I give it 5 stars for the idea and 1 star for the content, so I evened it out to 3 stars."
1,WE USED IT ONES.,ONLY FOR ONE TIME USE. I GUESS IS OK. WE USED IT ONLY ONES AND FOR THE KIDS. AND AFTER THAT WEEKEND THAT WAS IT.
5,Good Times,This is a GREAT float!!! My kids had hours of fun on the lake with this float! I plan on buying another one.. so that the kids can use one and the adults can have one for ourselves. Tons of room... easy to get in & out of. Good times!!
5,Awesome party boat!,"My husband and I bought this to take on our recent trip to Jamaica and all I can say it is awesome! I love the cup holder as they hold firm and very tight in place. The pillow rest really comes in handy when you are laying out in the sun for a while and need to sit up and rest! Would I buy again, heck yes and will be buying another to take on our next trip!"
3,Ok Product,"This product was very hard for me to find in a reasonable price range. I wasn't sure whether I would like this product or not, so I was looking for a cheap one. All I can say is, you get what you pay for. The product works well but the caps that screw on are loose and depending on how I prepare my eggs, they start squirting out from under the caps. This is on both products that I bought and I even tried switching the caps between the two and the same thing happens. If you are truly interested in this kind of product, I suggest paying more for a better one but this would be a good starter product to ""test"" out."
1,Bad Choice,Unfortunately it was the worst product I've bought at Amazon.It broke on first use. Choose another one.
4,Service,I was double charged on my credit card for the purchase. I have contacted the company but they have still not issued a credit. I want to order more of the same product but am not feeling secure with the ordering/charging system.
5,A destination worth the journey,"Maristella de Panizza Lorch's ""Mamma in Her Village"" is a deceptively simple novel. This account of the young adulthood of the author's mother offers a meditation on the bonds of family and the villages we inhabit - physical, temporal, familial - the villages of our own quotidian habits and knowledge, the forms and structures and traditions that define a life. In this idyll, however, Lorch presents the forces of change wrought by history, war, and the passage of time. This tension, as experienced through the eyes of a strong and intelligent woman, lies at the heart of this story.Through spare, economic prose, the author transports the reader to a prewar Europe usually obscured by romance and myth. Maristella Lorch's masterful novel is a clear-eyed look at history, love, and the strength of one woman in the midst of a turbulent era."
2,NiCD/Charger system malfunction,"After using this phone for two weeks the battery on the cordless phone would not keep a charge for more than 5 minutes. Replacing the battery has not helped and I have found other review sites for this phone with the same problem desciptions.Other than the battery charging system problem, the phone works fine except for the answering system. It is a typical garbled digital answering system."
2,Don't waste your money!,"The handset stopped working after 1 month of usage and replacing the batteries didn't work. It is a piece of junk. Also the answering system you can't hear the messages clearly, so I have to keep playing them until I can make some sense out of them. The LCD screen on the base is very poorly visible. If you fix the contrast it puts it too dark or too light, no happy medium. All in all looking for a unit to replace this one. What a waste of money. Should've read reviews before purchasing. GOODLUCK!"
3,Short life-line,Worked well until pad on cordless would not respond correctly. Used this set for about a year. Corded phone still fine for basic use.
1,Junk,"Everything other reviewers have noted about failure of the wireless handset battery/recharging function, poor answering machine volume and total lack of quality throughout is true. I bought before reading the reviews and am truly sorry and disappointed in this GE product."
1,Useless phone - GE should recall it and refund users,"I purchased two of these phones - both have failed. They have very weak wireless signal, you can barely hear the other party, the battery charger has failed on the remote unit - the answering machine muffles the messages - the wireless unit can not dial out becuse it has problems communicating to the base station - there is a constant buzzing noise on the wireless handset. i am going to throw them both away."
3,Good trimmer,"Good trimmer compare to its price, its works very well and keep the charge for long time. Its really work fir me so i recommend it to others"
1,Not one of their better products,"I had a Wahl trimmer that was given to me by my grandmother. It was well over ten years old and ran strong until the day I lost it. So when it came time to purchase its replacement, I figured why not try the new and 'improved' version. I was immediately disappointed. #1 It's extremely loud, making it almost impossible to trim ear hair. #2 it does a poor job trimming body hair as it tugs on every other blade of hair. and #3 it's attachment is a real POS! It is difficult to adjust and constantly falls off during the trim job(s). I simply threw mine in the trash."
1,Disappointing...,"This Trimmer does not do an even trim. I guess it all comes down to, ""You get what you pay for!"" I will keep it as a spare, but I am going to spend the money to get a good product..."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I assumed this Wahl trimmer would be great because I had a Wahl trimmer for a few years that was excellent. I was wrong, dead wrong, this product does not work, simply put, it's crap."
4,great for the price,"This performs better than my husband's old Conair trimmer. It is ergonomic in design. The only thing we do not like about it is the charger. The shaver sits in a base, but the charger is not connected to the base. So the shaver cannot be dropped in the base to charge, but must be manually connected to the charger cord before it is placed in the base. Otherwise good product."
3,Not great but not bad either,"This trimmer is just...ok. My biggest problem was how quickly it showed a little rust. The rust did not seem to affect the performance. However, I expected better quality from Wahl."
4,Men's Neck Shaver - Very Nice,I purchased this shaver/trimmer for my husband. He mostly has me use it to shave the back of his neck. This product trims the neck hair very nicely.
3,Truely economical,"Product functions well and does the necessary basics but lacks the closer shave.Perfect for economical purposes, i wouldn't recommend anything else, however, for a closer shave and spending a little more isn't an issue, then definitely make the extra investment.The close shave (for styling and shaping) is certainly the only issue i have, have used it for about 2 months now (since Sept).I had the Model CBTO before (broke down) and that certainly did a perfect job, but i cant find it anywhere."
4,handles basic trimming functions well,"The unit is a suitable trimmer for basic grooming functions for facial hair. It is cordless, which is a nice convenience, and it features a large number of attachments and a convenient stand and charging base. The features I use most often are the variable length guide (which can be set from 1-4 for varying beard lengths) and the trimmer by itself. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had a smaller trim head (or reverse side trimmer) for hard-to-reach locations, and if it had a ""turbo"" or high-speed mode. A solid trimmer overall."
4,Gift for Hubby,"It is very loud, the attachments are also hard to take off. Other then that it works good for the price."
