5,U S Map Placemat,"I actually bought this for my mother who has memory impairment. I circled all the places she's lived and talked about over the years. She loves it, and loves being able to point to the places that have been important in her life. Excellent quality and good price and service."
3,Great discussion tool,"I bought Read-a-Mats almost 20 years ago and loved them. I could have cereal in the morning and gaze at my map of the 50 states or the world map, thinking of future or pasts travel. Now that I have a 9-year-old I thought I should try to find them again and I was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon. Like many things, they are not made as well now but at least the place mats were available with maps. When I got them I was disappointed because they are no longer thick foamy place mats but basically laminated paper ( I could have made my own).Whether you buy them here or make your own, I HIGHLY recommend a set of place mats with maps. The constant conversations that these simple items give us are more than worth the price. We quiz each other on state capitols all the time. The dialogues more than pay for the product!"
5,Durable,Purchased this along with several other learning placemats. My kids love to look at it and talk about other places. Great learning tool!
1,What a disappointment,"Good thing you can't buy these anymore. I'm not surprised. Here's the bottom line. Plastic knob broke in the first week, can't get a replacement. The design is terrible, there is no lip on the back of the rack so when you try and grab it slides to the back and it is very hard to get anything out of it. Just a poor design all around. Waste of money"
2,Good oven but incredibly poor toaster,"This is so much harder to get good toast with than our old DeLonghi...Disappointing that what is generally a good appliance has such an ""all or nothing"" result on toast.There's no separate toast setting, only a one-hour timer. So turning the timer knob two millimetersmore takes your toast from just right to burnt. With a real toaster you just put in the bread, set thelight/dark and push a button. With this Oster it's like making toast in your oven - needs watching.Works well as an small oven, good for reheating pizza and for cooking small items likefrozen pot pies. Looks nice, and cleaning out crumbs is pretty easy.But as a toaster it's next to useless. If you toast a lot, look elsewhere."
5,Best sewing tool ever!,"I'm delighted to finally find this product so accessible again. If you sew, you MUST have one of these. It is the most underutilized and unknown professional ""sewing secret"" there is. Here's what I wrote on my site:""How many times have you tried to sew through too many layers and the needle will fight you and you end up with skipped stitches? Well, you give it a good whack (or two). Ever have trouble joining a four way seam? Well, hammer it before you sew and the ease of sewing will amaze you. Have problems top stitching pocket corners? Give it a whack. Sewing hammers are a great solution if you don't have a walking foot and just need occasional seam compression.""[...]"
2,From Wife To Dominatrix,"Not so interesting report of Ms. Stern's trials and tribulations as she goes from an unknowing innocent to a player for monetary gain. When god/Jesus and deliverance enters her methods all is lost and the D/s audience, too! This could have been a very intriguing instructional and informative tome to females, wives and lovers helping to understand male senusality and sexuality but it falls way short of anticipation, with only a brief mention of sexual relations 101. Sorry to burst the bubble. May she enjoy her life and her double-wide."
1,Misleading Title,"The title is very misleading. The first 30 pages of the book tell of this woman who becomes a dominatrix to please her new husband. Then, she has a religious epiphony during one of her sessions and decides to give it all up. The remaining 120 pages chronicle how her marriage comes to an end, she becomes financially destitute, and eventually finds some level of peace living alone in a trailer park. It's both a success story and a bit of a warning, but it's not very well written and not entertaining at all."
1,Don't even Consider it!,"Where to even start. The Story is that of a Husband, who Topped a woman from the bottom, encouraging her to become a Dominatrix. She agreed and very convincingly ""pretended"" to play the part of a Dominatrix for monetary gain and to gain her husbands approval and affections. . So sad, So Very very sad that a woman would willingly lower herself in such a way. This story is nothing more then that of a bitter x-wife whose deception and lies led to the demise of her marriage. As for GOD, how quickly the human's run to him/her/it when they hit ""rock bottom"" and then sit hypocritically in judgment of others who do not share their beliefs. She holds true to the saying ""Wrong for me, Wrong for everyone!"""
2,"Beware, color not even close to what's shown","Beware, you get a deep chestnut or chocolate brown (box stamped: DK BROWN). Real nice bag for the price, but a completely different color than what's shown."
3,Just ok!!,It would be nice and more durable if the inner side or cover was made of leather too. It need a little reinforcement at the top handle site to keep the shape of the suits. It need a better clamping mechanism to hold the hangers.
4,Kitten Heel Flip Flops,"They fit perfectly. Wore them at least 7 times but strap already broke. Would recommend, they are cute, comfortable but are plastic."
1,Completely dissatisfied!,"This high heel shoe was not what i asked for. It looked like a comfortable, gel-padded shoe in the picture, but in reality it is a hard plasticy shoe that gives you blisters on your feet. I wore this for four hours and had to wear athletic shoes and put bandaids on my numerous blisters for two days.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE FREAKISHLY SKINNY FEET AND A LOW INSTEP."
3,Required for class,Good 'stories' related to various cultural differences among family types. Some drag along or are filled with gaudy vocabulary use.
2,Poor fighting game,"I was really looking forward to an X-Men fighting game. Unfortunately it is a very poor game. While the graphics are good the rest is bad. Sure there are lots of characters but the stiff movements look and play bad. The AI is outrageous on this game, even on easy - the computer can do tons of damage while you struggle just to hit. And many of your hits never do damage. It is a very frustrating game. It is on par with old fighting games - very old ones. Even the 3D is limited. Very sad for X-Box. If you think you are interested in this game, do your self a favor and RENT it first - don't waste[your money] to find out how bad it is."
1,To: Mr. Guest from Las Vegas,You must be a real Nerd who enjoys childish games . Go back to playing Nintendo and leave the X-box to the big boys.Shame on whoever approved the release of this game! It is a disgrace for X-men and X-box alike.
1,Worst Comic Book Game EVER!,"This game is pure crap. The graphics are not outstanding by any stretch of the imagination, the controls are awkward, and the difficulty setting is frustrating. There are times your opponent starts pounding on you, and you arn't even able to get a hit in before the match is over. The game CAN be beat, but it's not worth the time you'll need to invest to do so. I was really hoping for this game to be more, but it isn't."
4,hear this people,video games are bad for your vision. dont you kids have something better to do then play video games. THINK A LITTLE IF YOU CAN????
3,Good Product. A little bent when arrived.,The end prong and pins were bent on one side when it arrived. I had to manually fix it but the product works fine now.
1,Don't waste your money,No game guide comes with it and no tutoral to help you along. You are unable to zoom in close to see how things fit when building your ship. Seems to be a very cheap version of a TYCOON game.
3,Ok,"I got the game thinking it was awesome, but it was ok.Pros:Graphics were above my expectationIt had zoom and rotate with unlockable itemsCons:No instruction manual, (had to press all the key board buttons to find the controls)It takes up 15 minutes of just watching your ship when traveling to ports.Had no natural disasters.Extremely hard to keep a cruise ship for just one cruise circuit.Constantly crashing on my computer."
2,Pretty much like any other tycoon,"Yup. It's pretty much like any other tycoon. Granted, I have not played the game in several years - since I bought it, really - but I remember being bored by it. And that was in the middle of my tycoon craze, so that tells you a lot."
3,Luxury Liner Tycoon,Game is in o.k. condition but was just in a cardboard slip and not it's original packaging. Was disappointed in this as it was a gift and it looked like I gave a used game.
1,Trash game,This game makes you want to throw up by the bad graphics and because of what the people look like and they don't even help you on this game.I suggest you throw this game away and you would rather be in prison than play this game.
1,UGH,"This is one of only two games I have ever thrown away.Maybe it was because I had to figure it out on my own, but I just couldn't get a handle on it.Give me Sims any day."
3,Fun...if you like to loose!!,"Luxury Liner Tycoon is very fun...if you don't mind loosing every time! There is a limited amount of money, and everything in the ship costs so much money to build, that by the time you start the ship, you have no more money to run it and end up loosing the game! Also, the costs of running the ships are astronomical!! You loose almost all your money and it gets very old after a while. There doesn't seem to be much of a point and you give up because it's too hard."
4,Good show!,Well done TV series. Fun and entertaining. Perhaps my only criticism is that they tend to include tiresome attempts at political commentary guised as a character's view.
1,"Less politics, more drama","Producers are more interested in pushing their political causes than in producing good drama. You have to suffer through the latest Hollywood politics in order to enjoy a few minutes of the good drama and acting. Getting worse, not getting better. A couple of days after I posted this review, I happened to notice that the original episode that ran 1/27/2013 had the all-time low ratings for any original GW episode. Between the endless political propaganda and the abysmal and ludicrous storyline involving Kalinda and her thug husband, I'm not surprised."
5,Such a wonderful show!,This show is so amazing that I buy it each week for $1.99! We tape too many things on Sunday so we have to buy this on Monday and I don't even mind spending the money!!!
3,"Awesome show-Amazon, not so much","5 stars for the show-0 stars for Amazon! I love this show and am trying to catch up on one that was interrupted by football on my DVR, so purchased through Amazon. Waste of $1.99!!! It was taking FOREVER to download to my Kindle, so tried to watch instantly on my laptop and it kept stopping to load or connect. The sound was also out of synch with the video. I stream video a lot, so I know there isn't a problem with my internet connection. Super annoying, I will look elsewhere on the internet next time before I buy anything like this from Amazon."
5,Addictive,"I started watching this because my wife wanted to watch. My thoughts were oh jeez another women done dirty. I was expecting another Lifetime network style show.OK, I was wrong and it is a well acted and they have some excellent writers with good dialogue."
5,I love this show!,"I missed one episode, so I had to buy it on Amazon. This is a great TV show, and I recommend it highly for anyone that likes good drama."
5,Amazing,"This show has great characters, great plots and very engaging. I think everyone should check it out. check it out"
5,A surprise around every corner!,"Season 4 has surpassed my expectations. I knew this cast would deliver as well as the writers, but this season has been better than even I could imagine. I look forward to each week, and find myself a bit upset when there isn't an episode to be watched. I'm a re-watcher & have likely re-watched each episode 3 times. Even then, I still find hidden comments or gestures missed the first time. The storyline is great and evvolving with the characters which in my opinion, is what makes it great. I look forward to the rest of what season 4 has to offer!"
5,Great show!!,This show is so enjoyable. I can't stop watching it. Don't know how I didn't realize what a great show this is at a much earlier date. I will not miss one episode. Fantastic drama and fabulous acting by the entire cast!!! AAA++++ RATING IN MY BOOK!!
5,Keeps getting better and better.,Wish I didn't have to keep buying it because of the #(*@^*!_ NFL runovers! :)But the show is great.
3,A pretty good video,"I liked this video and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lucero or Mariachi. She has always had the power to captivate an audience, no matter what type of music she performs."
3,Nothing Amazing - Move along,"Pretty much your Standard Chip, Taste is ok, but nothing that will bring you back."
5,Big hit with my kids,"These are great and my girls love them. There are many stickers and all different sizes. What is also nice is Austin wasn't left out, like he often is on their products. This was a great buy."
3,C.S.Lewis at the BBC,"I found the book to be interesting, but it was, for the most part, centered on the history of the BBC and it's personnel. I had hoped for some new insight into the person of C.S. Lewis. It that respect it was very disappointing."
1,Sad state of Civics Education,"This was at first a basic lesson in Civics for kids to learn about governmental structure and how we broke down the inception of the Constitution till the makers of this DVD decided to inject their LEFTEST IDEAOLOGY into it.What could have been a great tool for many different educators to teach the workings of American Government became a politically bias message delivery system. Who project their pro-gay agenda and their false concepts of a ""living Constitution"" instead of the actual facts that only Amendments can, in fact change, the CONSTITUTION.It was a waste of money and time...It was however a complete statement on the sad state of affairs in the American School System.Too bad they couldn't stick to the essentials and provide a good educational tool like their math DVD's which didn't contain political statements,just facts."
3,A difficult read for those still fiercely attached to mom.,I found Gornick's book both tragic and insightful. She seems to have become her mother in spite of herself. Gornick also seems to still be hoping and waiting for her mother to magically transform into the mom she's always longed for. The best she's received are a few memorable one-liners when least expected. I felt sorry for Gornick and her somewhat wasted life; I felt she is waiting for the hoped-for changes in her mother to somehow motivate the hoped-for changes in herself. If she would only realize she doesn't have to wait to recover the person she felt she lost so long ago.
3,Difficult to Follow Without Chronological TimeLine,"I found this book boring and difficult to follow. When reading memoirs, I find that I must have some kind of chronological line to refer to; however, in this book, there is none. Gornick aims for showing the development of both the narrator and the narrator's mother, but even that, I did not get. If you enjoy reading memoirs and do not need some kind of time element to keep you on track, you should purchase this book. It will keep you entertained."
3,"Cliched, all around.","Upon first reading Fierce Attachments, I thought that it was an acceptable novel- interesting anecdotes, good dialogue, etc. However, after thinking it through and re-reading sections, it became painfully clear that Gornick has no deep insights to tell us, and because of this lack of original and profound thought, she writes about cliched things in a cliched manner. Yes, the novel can be entertaining, especially if the subject matter holds interest. In my opinion, get it from the library. It's not worth the money."
4,Color Gothic,"Its hard for me to appreciate gothic horror set in modern times. Color takes away from gothic atmosphere as do planes, automobiles and electric lighting. The basic story is a good one and Bava does manage to pull off the gothic look, although not nearly as well as in earlier black and white films. Well acted and not a bad movie, just not as good as expected from Mario Bava."
2,could hardly finish it,I don't really understand the hype around this director. His work is nothing like Alfred Hitchcocks and the only thing that made me add a star to this movie was the sets which were very good at least for this movie. I couldn't stand the wooden dialogue and found the acting rather poor much like Argento's work. Some of my friends talk none stop about Italian horror but I find it to not be that good with the exception of Fuchi.
4,Good Bava,"This was the supposed sequel to Lisa and the Devil, Bava's shimmering, near-incomprehensible masterpiece. In Baron Blood, Bava has toned the story line down considerably. One of the overiding themes still is cause and effect; that is, in the world of Bava, our actions that we know are wrong but that we do anyhow can have horrifying consequences. At least in this movie, the repercussions manifest themselves in the lifetimes of the principal characters. The story resolution is much more believable (not to say digestable) than Lisa and the Devil. Unfortunately, by stepping a little more into the mainstream with Baron Blood (less risks are taken with the principle characters this time around), Bava has sacrificed much of the haunting uneasiness that made Lisa so enjoyable. He also doesn't have Telly Savalas in this film either!"
3,So-So,"A reasonably enjoyable film, enhanced by the presence of sexy Elke Sommer and talented Joseph Cotten. Although ""Baron Blood"" has the characteristic failings of horror films of that era, particularly the non-U.S. ones, I would say that it's superior to most of the others of that time, which tended to be inept and cheaply made."
3,Baron Blood,"Baron Blood is a good example of Mario Bava's later directorial attempts,mediocre plot & story/ excellent production & film work.It lacks the scariness & atmosphere of earlier gems,The Mask of Satan(Black Sunday) & Black Sabbath.The movie is still pretty cool though & is a must for Bava fans."
2,Paradox was better,"Paradox, the first book in this series, was chock-full of ideas and story. There was some violence, but it advanced the story, and the descriptions were ... not restrained, but appropriate.Context is chock-full of blood and gore. Resolution, the third book, is worse. It's as though Meanie ran out of ideas, even ran out of story, but had to keep going to make a trilogy, and replaced the science fiction with shock value. Context and Resolution together could have been told in half a book."
1,Why Isn't TlC Doing Anythang,I Love The Cd It's Good but The Dvd Sucks I'm Not Hate'in on TLC Are Noething.

2,someone should mention this is censored,someone should mention this is censored . . . even though their main albums didn't have parental advisory warnings on them this compilation bleeps out some of the content. don't bother - get the original albums.
2,Boring ....,"This game is as somone else said this game is basicly frogger , with a criket. I wouldn't spend money on this again. Alot of free games that are online are a lot better than this game."
4,Essays and Sketches,"This short book is basically a collection of a number of Tom Wolfe's social drawings and a couple of his essays, first published in 1980. The drawings have much the same clever humor and satire of his writing. There is not really a common thread for the book's content. For those who are fans of Tom Wolfe, you'll find this to be essential reading. For those less familiar with his work, I'd recommend starting somewhere else. For essays, try ""Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers"" and ""The Painted Word."" His novels are all excellent--any of them are a great place to start whether its ""Man in Full,"" ""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" or one of the others. He is really one of the top writers in the US."
3,More than a bit imitative.,"Tom Wolfe certainly has talent with pen & ink, and some of the caricatures show a fine eye for caricature. Unfortunately, beyond this aspect these illustrations are like Ralph Steadman without the intensity, or pale imitations of the Munich artist Heinrich Kley. They have none of the elegance or humor of Kley's work, in fact, most of the miniaturized people make little sense in Wolfe's context. His variation of line weight and overall tonal distribution leaves something to be desired as well."
4,Integrating Eastern Philospohy and Christian Sensibility,"An explorations of the commonality between Eastern Spirituality and Traditional Christian beliefs. Bede Griffiths is a contemporatary mystic - a convert from the Church of England and a Benedictine priest who started a Christian Ashraham in Southern India. He weaves a tapastry of the ""interspiritual"" thought of the Jesus who worked and taught in the world of the East.Really it's not so far out as it seems and is a very good book for discussion groups."
1,"What an irritating clock. It's pretty to look at, but a pain to use.",I'll be honest. I only bought this clock because Philipe Starck designed it. That was a mistake. It's a huge pain to set the time and change the alarm due to the minimalist set of buttons on the back. And the laser light that projects the time on the ceiling stopped functioning properly after a few years. It's so overly complicated and irritating to use that I can't recommend this. Do you really need to know the wind speed and barometric pressure readings at 3am? Probably not.
3,Serve the purpose.,I bought three packages. In one package nearly every sleeve was stuck together. It was difficult to open to insert the card without crinkling the plastic. But this was athe best price for the colume & they serve the purpose.
4,Good covers,"Some were more difficult to get on the 4X6 cards, but overall they are great. They do their job well."
1,not the best eye patch on the market,"We have a child who suffers from lazy eye, we were given these patches to try... we found they very irritating to the eye and our son was always requesting the patch be removed. In addition they are very adhesive, infact after wearing the patch some of the adhesive would also be left on our sons skin. I would not reccomend these patches, we use the opticlude patches, they are gentle they stay on well and our son rarely complains."
1,WARNING...LATEX PRODUCT!,The Coverlet Eye Occlusor patches we purchased are made of natural rubber latex and many people have latex sensitivities or an allergy (we found this to be true with our daughter). Our daughter has been patching an eye for vision therapy for 3 years and never complained about it until the itchiness occurred when she used the Coverlet patch. We've always used 3M Nexcare pediatric patches which work very well and I would highly recommend to any other little patchers out there!
5,Excellent product,"My son has been wearing eye patching for 1 1/2 years and we found this brand to be the best. It has the strongest adhesive which means that it covers his eye completely so there are no ""see through"" spots. Once the eye patch is on my son doesn't try to remove it."
5,"If you like Green Day, but wish the 12 year olds didn't.....","...then this is your band. Straight outta San Diego, they shoulda been huge. It really does sound like Green Day if they were drunk, a little sloppier, coarser vocals, but the hooks and the heart is all there."
4,Worked as advertised,This is the second Linksys wireless router I have installed. The install went reasonable well and the unit is working as advertised. These products seem to be a good workhorse with reasonable software/controls available for the average user. This would be a good unit for your first install. It appears that the software to control the wireless unit is only available via the wireless connection. This is not a problem -- just an observation.
3,"Eh, its okay.",i guess this isn't a bad product. I do not see a difference in this expensive router shooting the signal any father than my cheap belkin did. i don't think its worth the money.
2,Not to good,"To set up, it's really slow, what is worse is that I bought the usb wireless with the speedbooster and the signal that picks up it's terrible, and for the other laptops that I connected, I sony vaio, a 2 Dell laptops, they disconnect, conflict with DHCP all the time, not very good, I recomend most dlink routers, I have one of those I it's great."
1,Manufacturing problems,"I spent THREE HOURS talking to Linksys customer service about this product...only for them to tell me that it wasn't I who was installing it wrong, but many of these products (this type, to be exact), had a chip that made it impossible to correctly install. Good job, Linksys.And did I mention that this was the second wireless router from Linksys that I problem installing?Ridiculous. I hope everyone else's Linksys routers work better than mine did,for I will never purchase a Linksys product ever again."
1,Total nightmare!,"After spending 2 hours on the phone with tech support that was located overseas, I FINALLY had my Linksys WRT54GS up and running. It was a total pain to set up - the installation software that came with the product was pretty much useless. For a whopping 3 months the router worked flawlessly. I then spent another hour on the phone with overseas tech support who determined that my wireless router was defective and suggested that I return the product to the store."
2,Tech Agent Retirement Act!,"Bought the unit (and the respective Linksys pci card and antenna)in November through Dell. First unit failed internally and had to be sent back for a new/refurbished unit. Then in mid-November began the conversations with LinkSys tech help. Setup went reasonably well, but signal strength and loss of network connection have been episodic ever since. Estimate I've spent ten to twelve hours on the phone with them, easily the most time I've ever spent with computer tech help for ANY reason! The router does not have the signal strength I expected (I only needed about thirty feet) and the unit is not functionally reliable. Performance has been marginal at best, and while the Tech Help from India has tried hard, I am resigned to periodic time spent with them as long as I use the system."
5,"solid, fast router","We've owned a number of routers over the years; these have included products from Netgear & Motorola. None have been as easy to set up & maintenance free as the Linksys WRT54GS. I've used this in our home for probably 18 or more months. Additionally I've set up several of these for friends. The device easily support our desktop and laptop as well as vonage & nextalarm devices. Performance is rock solid. Support from Linksys (rarely needed) has been great. Connection with laptop several floors down is always stable & fast. If you need a router, Linksys is the one."
3,good for a year,"When I first bought this product, it worked great for exactly a year. Upon its anniversary, the router decided it did not want to work with any of my computers. The replacement sent under warranty had the same mindset and others I know have had the same experience. It's a good short-term router, but if you need a router for longer than that, do not buy it."
4,So easy to use!,"After getting sick of sharing one broadband connection with the rest of my family (2 computers, one connection - it worked when I was away at school, but when at home, not so much!), we decided to build our own little network. I researched wired and wireless routers, and eventually decided on wireless based on the recommendations of several friends and colleagues. Enter the Linksys WRT54GS. The router was easy to set up, and the EasyLink Advisor program that came with the router used very easy to follow instructions. I was able to set up our network in under an hour.The negatives:EasyLink, while easy to use, is a little cumbersome. It seems to move pretty slowly, though the directions are, again, easy to follow, and illustrated.Wireless connections are indeed affected by barriers. Like walls and floors/ceilings! The connection quality across the house isn't as good as, of course, in the same room as the router."
4,"Yes, it works with a Mac","I bought this Linksys router on the recommendation of many on the Net as well as my compatriots in my IT dept as a dependable brand. It's set up software is Windows only, so doing it manually required some education. This forced me to get a primer on networking and more specifically, wireless. Not a bad thing, just took a couple hours. All the admin is done via a browser, so access was not a problem. I'm using this via a cable modem wireless to a couple of old macs -- a G4 desktop w/an Aria 'G' wireless card and a G4 PB with a 'B' airport card; no problems."
4,A good high-bandwidth router,"My Belkin router began performing poorly during high-bandwidth times (ie. downloads, gaming, tivo, etc). I spoke with several people about an inexpensive replacement since I work in the IT field. Almost everyone of them said Linksys. With such a strong lean toward Linksys, I decided on buying one and went with the SpeedBoost version, since I do a lot of in-home networking as well.It is a great router and I would recommend it for most. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Fair price- Linksys = Cisco- Many configurable options (including parental controls)- Its fast and can handle tons of bandwidthCons:- Initial setup was WAY more complicated than it should be- Should have come with directions for intermediate/advanced users- Using their setup software was an awful experience- Does not wall mountAll in all I am pleased with my choice."
2,LINKSYS WRT54GS ISSUES,"As usual, delivery was timely and the deal went smoothly. As for the router, this was my first experience with wireless networking and I feel very strongly that the setup directions need more detail. Eventually it was up and running but then I discovered that the swithching power supply for the router also emits a noisy RF signal. I would not have discoered this except that I am an amateur radio operator and found the signal able to be heard on one of the VHF ham bands. This is something that LINKSYS could easily remedy, however, I have contacted them and heard nothing in response after two weeks. I ran CAT5e from the second floor to the basement and was done with it. Larry"
4,router for the everyday person?,this is a great router with great phone support. I would have it given it a 5 star but the instructions are way too vague. Customer support worked me through everything though.
4,pretty decent,"Love it, wireless works a lil faster, 10 times easier to install than its predecessor. Software is more flashy than anything else but helps the unexperienced user.Worth the money!"
1,Horrible Router!,"Our first linksys lasted 8 years, this has been in our house for a month and we give up, it is worthless. On the phone with Linksys support for 2 hours not much help and difficult to understand. The one button set up is a joke. Like other reviewers, this router crashed constantly, we restart the thing 7-10 times per day. Junk!"
2,Can't get it to completely work,"This may be a good product, I don't know. I can't get it to work with my DSL modem which my ISP just sent me. They won't help with the router and the router doesn't document what to do with the modem. So I'm back to my old Linksys router."
4,Difficulty in setup,The router works fine but the setup instructions given in the enclosed CD-ROM did not work and I had to get Linksys support on the phone. After that things were set up fine.
1,Unstable router - at least for me,"I bought this router couple of weeks back from Bestbuy. Installation wasn't hard - fairly straightforward. Their controls are very professional - might be intimidating to non-IT guys. I dont see this router reliable at all. When I take my laptop to my bedroom in the 2nd floor, the signal strength is too low. The connection frequently drops out - couldnt explain why - even at night 11pm when there are no microwaves or phones etc. I live in a single family house and interferrences practically nil.In my Apple Powerbook, the SSID name keeps disappearing on a constant basis. At the same time, my old Netgear MR814 stays good. I dont know whats going on.Looks like there are many satisfied users out here but this one is not for me."
1,POC = Piece of crap,"After three hours with my DSL provider and the Liksys person we were unable to establish the wireless network. I was told by the Linksys person to return the POC (router WRT54GS) and obtain another POC; and start all over. I uninstalled Linksys, aka, POC. It took another 2 hours to re-establish my DSL back to where I started. Can you spell POC. Shame on Linksys, I am no fool or dummie!"
4,Wired networks are for chumps!,"This is an awesome router, once you get it working. Using the enclosed CD did not set it up properly. I had to go to their website for support, and download a quick little program that did everything. Why that program isn't part of the included software is beyond me... I gave 4/5 stars because the setup was such a hassle."
1,cant get it to work,I haven't got the wireless part to work. I put in a password but router won't recoginize it.
1,Annoying product and customer service,"This item shipped fast from Amazon (3 days), but the product and customer service are annoying. The installation cd did not do the auto-setup that everyone talks about, even though I have XP. Had to call the special Linksys customer service line specially designated for Amazon, supposedly faster and better than Linsys proper. The first person who answered is rude. Then I waited for 25 minutes to get someone on line, only after literally, going thru over 25 menu options to get to a technician. The technician worked thoroughly and carefully to get everything done, but it was a 45 minute trouble-shooting process. Downloaded firmware and set up the router manually, and even had to assign a new IP address to my computer. All that and I ony get one reception bar and intermittant connectivity in my art studio, which is about 100 feet from the router."
1,Didn't work with my ISP even though my ISP said it should.,"After spending hours trying to connect, I finally called tech support and after spending 40 minutes with them, I was told that my ISP was incompatible. However, my ISP said that other customers could use Linksys with no problem."
1,Linksys WRT54gs wireless router,"I am not a ""techie"" so I don't know the range of choices on the market but I would research a more powerful router before buying this one again. If there is a wireless phone, a microwave, etc. in the vacinity it doesn't work. The tech support is extremely spotty and it took approximately 8 calls to set up the system for two computers. Only one support person realized that my Windows system was in conflict with their software and helped me circumvent the problem. This was after multiple calls and several hours of frustration. Yuk!"
1,Complete Disaster,"Three hours with foreign tech support (including half an hour on hold the first time). Swapping cables, resetting this and that, downloading nonfunctional software. Worst experience I've ever had with the computer. Never Again Anything Linksys!!!"
3,Ok - not great,"Well, it wasnt that easy to set up as described. And performance hasnt been stellar. but then again, it's not that expensive either."
4,Great Router---but beware if you have a static IP,"I have a static IP. With a static IP, you can't use the enclosed CD ROM to load and configure this machine. I spent over 4 hours talking with the Linksys rep in India...trying to get this router working. I'm pretty technical...so this was very frustrating. The Linksys 1st tier support person was clueless and told me it was not possible to use this machine with a static IP. She said the machine was faulty. I insisted on being transfered to a 2nd tier support person. He was finally able to assist me.Now that I'm up and running, I love it. It's fast and reliable. I would not say that the range is great....but it's OK.I'd highly recommend purchasing the router is you have a dynamic IP."
5,Best Router out there,"I have tried many routers and this is the best and easiest router out there you can. Anyone can do the setup it is idiot-proof. I was able to setup and run my router with a network cable, wirelessly, and also with my PS3 all in less than 1 hour. Without having to open up the ports. This router has all of the ports open that you need to play online with your PS3. No phone calls needed just put the CD in and follow the instructions it's that easy."
5,easy to set up,Worth the money. On amazon I saved almost $30.00 compared to my local Best Buy. Great decision on my part. Easy to follow instructions with great access to questions/answers online. Would highly recommend!
4,Linksys wireless router,"Very easy setup. Good performance in regards to speed and stable connection. Did lose configuration settings once, but good phone support."
1,"Poor follow up with tech support, some guy overseas hung up, No more purchases from Linksys.","mOST DISCOURAGING PURCHASE i HAVE EVEER HAD, TEC SUPPORT FROMLINKSYS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND BASIC ENGLISH AND I CAN'T SPEK HIS DIALECT. FURTHER LINKSYS CUSTOMER SUPPORT HER IN THE USA, JUST SAID TOO BAD.NEVER WITH PURCHASE A LINKSYS PRODUCT EVER!"
5,One of the most trouble free computer items I have installed,"I bought this product on the recommendation of my university's IT dept., which shares space in my office at my library. It was one of the easiest products I have ever installed on my computer, the only problem being when it didn't light up--turned out my cleaning woman had turned off the power strip I had plugged this into, so when I turned it back on, it lit up like a Christmas tree, and the rest of the installation was completed within minutes! I got this so I could use my Nokia 810 internet tablet at home, and it works great on the network anywhere in my house. The only product that installs more easily than this is Skype. I was so pleased with this that when I saw a couple of people looking at it in a discount store about a week later, I told them they could get it cheaper on Amazon due to free shipping and no sales tax!"
1,"When it works, it's great.",It's the other 90% of the time that I don't like it. Does not keep the wireless settings. I have to reconnect thru the DSL and set this up everytime I startup my computer. This is the second and last Linksys router in my life.
3,Difficult to set up,"While I will admit to very good assistance from LINKSYS, it still was a most difficult product to set up. It took hours of trying even with assistance from someone who already had a similar product. It is just not for the average user to undertake."
3,Parental Control service problem,"When linksys parental control server (pccfg.ourlinksys.com) is down, your internet access option is all/or nothing.The only choice is either to disable parental control service temporarily from the router to allow unrestricted access to internet for everyone, or no internet access at all.Also, time of the day restrictions works only on new connections. For example, if you set up the time restriction to allow internet access between 8:00AM to 11:00PM, then new connection attempt after 11:00PM will be blocked.However, if someone started a session to download a large file (say 2GB) before 11:00PM, then the download session will continue even after 11:00PM. For some P2P client, this means the connection will be on forever as long as someone is trying to download from/to his/her PC. In other words, the parental control service cannot block ""ESTABLISHED"" connections after 11:00PM. I think the same is true for yahoo, AOL instant messenger session."
1,Doesn't work long,"We've had this WRT54GS router for 3 months now and it's already stopped working. Nothing has helped. I can't understand tech support, when I FINALLY get through to someone. Are they required to learn English as a second language?For the 3 months it worked, it was wonderful, but 3 months isn't long enough for me to keep shelling out this kind of money.I am looking to buy another kind.maribethsmom, NC"
1,Do Not Buy if you play WoW,"If you play World of Warcraft, save yourself a lot of grief and get something else. But don't take my word for it, search the forums there for this model number."
1,Poor Customer Service,The Linksys customer service rep didn't speak English well (an understatement). Sounded like he was from India: why did he ask me for my cashew over and over? (case number?) The whole conversation was a garbled mess. I couldn't tell if knew a router from a VW bug. It was a real pain dealing with them.
1,so-so performance,"i get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.At best, each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again. if you're doing something important, forget it!"
4,Wireless Broadband,I have had this router for over a year now and have had no problems with my son's xbox or my laptop wireless connection. If there were issues they were mine.
5,Very happy with this router!,"Easy to install, I was set up in 5 minutes!! Good range, good speed! It's worth the cost (which i found quite low!). If you need wireless access, with good speed and security, this is the product for you."
5,Very reliable product !,"Had to call the support in India, they were easy to work with and it's up and running smmoth from here. Great deal !Already reccomended it to others."
4,Excellent value for money,This product performs very well indeed and enables internet access for both my desktop and notebook PCs via my cable modem. Internet access was a little frustrating initially but I resolved this by going to technical support/easy connect on the Linksys.com web site which guided me through the process with not problem. I would highly recommend this product.
2,Linksys router loses on power drop,"Had a power drop, likely due to lightning in the local area.First, all the wired network settings were discovered to be missing. Sympton is intermittent notification that PC is connected to network, then not connected. Pull the power plug on the Linksys router, re-plug, and the wired network is restored.Second, wireless network connections are gone. For this one, had to go into the router setup and re-enter the SSID name. Wireless network restored.Will this all be necessary every time the router suffers a power dropout? Am I going to have to purchase a uninterruptable power supply to keep the router alive?"
4,Good Product,"I had some setup problems with this router, because I needed the firmware update which I hadn't downloaded before I tried to set up the network. I installed the firmware upgrade and instantly the problems disappeared and the router setup was complete. Also, it doesn't seem to work at all with the Netgear ""B"" cards I have on some of my computers, so I will have to update the cards. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just expensive.Technical support has been fair. I called during the initial installation and worked with a technician until he realized I needed the firmware update. Once I downloaded the update, I called back to get a technician to walk through the installation with me and no one was available. They said they would call back and never did. I got tired of waiting and installed it myself. Fortunately, didn't have any troubles.Ultimately, I am pleased with this purchase, although I'm disappointed that it doesn't seem to work with my existing network equipment."
3,Ok but...,"This was an upgrade from the WRT54G v1.1 that I previously had before the power supply died. The one big difference I have found out is that this model doesn't support the third party firmware that really added to the functionality of the router. Because of that, I am using it just as a bridge and using a Cisco router for my broadband connection. The stock software just doesn't have the features and management that I would like. This was a step backward from the older version."
3,"Easy to install, but I couldn't keep the connection consistent","When you get the correlating linksys speed boost card, you do get the advertised 50mbps.I found it fairly easy to install.Once setup though, I found I lost the wireless connection. I would then have to drag an ethernet cord from my computer to the router, and go thru the wizard to re-set it. This happened probably once a day for a week.A 10 minute hassle that I wasn't willing to go on with. I still am not sure if I should blame the card or the routerAlso, I use my computer for gaming and decided that 50mbps wasn't good enough for me. (ironforge lag anyone?) So i returned the wireless card, and kept the router. I'm using it like a regular-old router with an ethernet, and it works just fine."
4,Installation Difficulty,"Experienced considerable difficulty in getting this router operational. The technical support from Linksys is unsatisfactory. The support is in India. Although I served two years in that part of the world as a US Diplomat, I experienced considerable language difficulty. Had to resort to e-mail for communication. Because of the techs lacked of knowledge I would be passed from one to another and ultimately be cut off. On one occasion there was a succession of five with no resolution. This difficulty pertained for more than a week with up to four hour daily sessions. I finally resolved the problems on my own."
2,CAUTION,"If you're thinking of ordering this for use with third-party open-source firmware like Alchemy or DD-WRT, you're out of luck. The router that now ships is ""WRT54GS v.5"", which is vastly different from v.1, v.2, v.3, and v.4. Version 5 does not use Linux-based firmware and is therefore not flashable with third-party firmware. You'll have to find an older version on eBay etc.I ordered this thinking I could use Alchemy, not realizing it came in different versions, since Amazon's product info doesn't list a version number. Now I'm out shipping costs in both directions, and I'm pissed. Don't end up like me.Just letting you know :)"
1,This is a worthless piece of garbage,"5 out of 6 people I've heard buying this, me included, had huge problems with it. The main problem is it freezes randomly and often very soon. That's enough to make it fly through the window (I'm going to do that). Web configuration is a mess and very slow. It doesn't assign static ip to mac addresses (by design) but then the dhcp server works only when it's in a good mood. I think that explains the low price compared to the good reviews: if it works it's great value for the money, but most of them just don't work !"
4,Good Product!,Fast economical router that does what it's supposed to (I paid $69 with free shipping through Amazon). Set up took a while and we had trouble with Window's Vista recognizing our other computer that runs Window's XP but that's not because of the router. My Brother who is in software development recommended this router from Amazon for my home network and so far no problems. If you're looking for an economical fast router then the Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster is for you!
2,Not impressed with router lifspan,"This is my second run at this product and its predecessor. The one I bought less than a year ago just died, and the one before in about 18 months. Talked to tech support about it - they indicated that was pretty typical. Considering the irritations with setting up the new one, not to mention the cash, it's not making me too happy tonight. Looking for an alternative."
1,RETURNED,"I returned it several weeks ago. But no refund yet.. =( On the Linksys boards, there are known problems with this router such as drop outs and slow speeds. Don't buy this!"
2,I may be wrong but it is limited,I bought this to replace a Asus WL 500 Deluxe that had bad wifi. The things I notice about this router is that you can't set a list of mac address to have dhcp assign certain ip addresses to.The other thing that both the Asus and DI-604 also had is you could cross connect ports. In other words I have two boxes inside my network with sshd running. One I can get to by connecting to router ip port 22 the other one router ip port 1022. The router takes port 1022 traffic and routes it to the second box. The V7.02 software on this netlink doesn't seem to do that.The wireless does work! Can't say that about my asus.Wes
1,linksys wireless router review,"The equipment did not work probably. I have to contact linksys many time to fix it but it did not work. After that, Linksys changed another router for me. The seller did not help me anything in fixing the problem and change the product. It's was bad."
1,Such Trash,Linksys is a respected company and I have used their products before but I dont know why and how they managed to come up with such a aweful product.I purchased one 4 months back. It kept on going dead and I had to restart it almost every 30 min. I called amazon and got it replaced.The new one also didn't work that good. And finally one day it went dead and I pressed the reset button located at the back.After that it has never worked. I am going to call Amazon to see if they can refund me some money or otherwise I am trashing.I have made a vow never to use linksys products again.
4,Finally Wireless,The set-up was easy to understand and once the set-up was completed it worked!Happy to be Wirless
1,Just a Nightmare,"My wife and I bought the WRT54GS as a Xmas gift for someone. Having an earlier model Linksys wireless router I figured how hard could it be to install this for the recipient. This thing is a NIGHTMARE!I am on weekend 3 of attempting to make this work with a cable modem internet connection. I have even taken the gift back to attempt to figure it out at home. A couple of Internet searches have proven to me that I am not alone. Numerous others have also complained that although they can get the Wireless connection established, the actual internet connection does not work.As someone who works with computers on a daily basis, this should not be this difficult. I can only imagine how frustrating this must be for someone without a lot of experience working with computers.It appears in their efforts to make the router more secure and better overall they failed to make it easier to use despite the marketing as being easier to setup.Weekend 3 and counting!"
1,Linksys Wireless Router problem,The Linksys wireless router was defective and it did not work from the first day that I bought it.( Thanks to Amazon for helping me return it ). I had a Linksys wireless router earlier (1.5 years ago ) and that was also not very effective....I would not buy this product again.
3,"Nice, when it works","Just another reviewer saying that the router requires rebooting at least once a week. If I had a router like this on my enterprise network, it would be stomped on and made into little bits. If you want top quality wireless, get the Cisco 1200 or the like. This stuff is cheap to buy and has its problems."
2,Still haven't been able to install and I had help from IT support.,According to the over simplified instructions I just have to follow the on screen instructions. I've been working on some of my weekends to try to get this thing running and it really gets frustrating. I haven't given up hope and next step is to use special instructions on the Linksys support page.
4,Go without the Speedbooster to save some money,So far so good. Was initially a little confusing to set up 2 desktops but I turned it off and they both connected. My laptop has a centrino processor so I really didn't need the speedbooster. Its suppose to work faster with a speed booster card but the speed is fine so I would recommend the linksys without speedbooster to save a few bucks. Also I had to call Linksys because I couldn't figure out how to get into the secure key to make my laptop configure with the security protocal but they were really helpful and it turned out fine.
3,MAC filtering doesn't work,"Helped a friend set this up a month ago.When you turn on MAC filtering, nothing can connect. It's supposedly a known bug.The Linksys laptop speedbooster also won't connect if you turn WPA on. Friend called tech support (the $5/hr in India kind) and they told him to turn off encryption to get it to work! Guess that's what you get from $5/hr support :-PLinksys' USB speedbooster adapter works ok w/ WPA."
1,Buy something else!,"If you want constat problems and you enjoy speaking to a technician in India ... this is the product for you. If you want a good product with good customer service, buy a different brand."
1,Dont buy this product if you own Dreamweaver,This product was awful. We could not get Dremweaver to work. We contacted Adboe and they said they needed port 21 opened. I had to spend 9.95 to have this port opened. After one hour on the phone nothing works. I just returned the prodct. Very frustrating talking to India. They only good thing I can say is they offer 24/7 support.
1,Needs resetting every 3 days,Don't buy this. This needs powering off every 3 days. It just hangs every 3 days. Same thing happens with the one we have in the office. Unreliable.
2,Disappointing Range,"Somehow the Ethernet cable running about 150' from my office to my house got cut (maybe a squirell, because they once chewed on the main cable line, stopping all reception)and I decided to do it all wirelessly. I had already bought a new Linksys wired router to accomodate my office Vista computer, but the wireless ones in the house couldn't connect, even though they showed 2 green bars. Linksys figured out that my old wireless router was gone, and since it was 3 years old and out of warranty anyway, they suggested a new one. I specifically asked the range of this one; they specifically said that it was up to 300', with 150' optimum. BULL!!! It won't go more than about 75', and that is straight line-of-sight without any blockages. I have now gone for a ""range extender"" which may do the trick. If it doesn't, it's back to a long Ethernet cable, and this time I'll run it through PVC pipe, and use the wireless router inside the house only."
1,Don't waste your money,"Terrible product. Go to the product website, the reviews are all bad. I don't know where amazon got theirs from. It booted me off every 20 seconds or so. The Wii would never even connect. Returned it and tried a different router. No problems at all with the other brand. It was the linksys for sure. Pain in *."
5,Linksys Router is Better than Netgear,"I had been using a Netgear WGB111 wireless router in our home for several months, but the connection speed was extremely unreliable and variable. By resetting the router frequently, speed improved. However, it was driving us crazy, so we decided to shop for a new router.After reading lots of reviews we decided to buy the Linksys WRT54GS. What a difference! This router really rocks.We have had to reset it a couple of times in the 2 months we've been using it, but when it has happened it is obvious (unlike the Netgear) and the connection is immediately restored."
1,Junk,"This item is terrible. Lost connection multiple times a day, does not block a single website, and just a lot of tweaking to make it work at all. I bought a Netgear router to try something new, and after 1 day, I took the linksys to the dumpster where it belongs. netgear is far better than this thing, which isnt even a great paper weight. Only reason it has 1 star is amazon forced me to rate something."
2,Transmission interference,"Its transmission has an adverse effect my DVD/CD driver, and the house phone I resolved the house phone problem by moving the receiver to a different location, but I am unable to resolve the problem with the DVD driver"
4,Seems good to me,"This thing seems like a decent piece of equipment. The setup was easy and it worked without a problem. One MINOR annoyance, you can change the internal IP address of this thing to 192.168.XXX.XXX but the DHCP server will only hand out IPs in the range of 192.168.1.XXX. No real biggie, just personally annoying."
2,Version 5 Really Is Awful,"Other reviews here mention that v5 of this router is a bad buy, and I can certainly confirm that that is the case. Since I wasn't planning on using any third-party firmware, and wasn't planning to use the router for anything exotic, I thought the stock Linksys firmware would be adequate. It wasn't. The router crashed three times while I was clicking through the web admin tool, and (Linksys) firmware updates refused to work.I returned it for the WRT54GL model, and replaced that model's Linksys firmware with the third-party DD-WRT. Installation was painless, and the web admin tool is actually easier to use. I can't attest to the stability of the stock firmware on the L model, because I didn't keep it around long, but supposedly it's better than the firmware on the v5. If you're not looking to replace it with something from a third party, though, it might not be worth the trouble."
4,"Good Router, Bad software.","When it comes to setting it up, it's fairly simple. All you have to do is plug the internet cable into the modem, and than it's basically good to go. Then, open up the laptop, and go to the Connections, and you will see the wireless options, and then you should click it and so forth.There is Software, which i don't really like. It stresses that you have to run the CD first. So, i did, and when i did so, and followed everything, it said that it couldn't connect to the internet, which was very silly. It said that i had to plug it in with a wire, and all of that first, which i did, but in the end, it didn't connect.So, i just did it as normal, and it workedThe internet is great, my satellite laptopmakes it all the easier too, it's great.Don't like the software though"
1,WRT54GS V5 freezes when using bittorrent,"I used to have a cheaper Netgear WGR614v4 and worked great, but it lacks of QoS feature so bought a Linksys WRT54GS V5 from amazon a month ago... oh what a mistake.I am sure this router had its reputation in the past, but not V5, it is slow and freeze a lot especially when using BitTorrent (I used bitcomet and utorrent, same problem), I even upgraded to the latest firmware v1.50.8 (Linksys released on 5/30/2006) but no improvements at all. In order to avoid frequent freezes, I needed to limit no more than 3 download tasks and global network connections to be less than 100 in order to not-freeze so frequently, but it was very slow.My advice is, if you only use this router for simple internet browsing, then WRT54GSv5 will be probably fine, but once you need to add some real works such like P2P download, then avoid this particular router/version."
5,great deal,Great router with detachable antennas as well as great price. Router showed up in mail within a week with standard shipping although the predicted 4-17 day s&h time. I was able to configure the device within 2 minutes and i needed no soldering when i added high gain antennas.My main highlight of this product is the wide capability with the low price.
4,poor seller service,"i am not happy with the seller,thay did not send the power cord that fits this router,i have sent sevral emails asking for the the power cord,thay said thay would send me the right one but never did,and will not answer my emails,so the seller comunication sucks.i will probely will not purchase from this seller again."
3,works great..once you get it installed!,"had this router for a few years, i think i originally bought it back in 2008.brought router home tried to hook it up to no avail. called tech support for Verizon and linksys to no avail. considered selling it on ebay.recently bought blu ray player and wanted to get online. so after several HOURS OF SEARCHING and READING online forums, i finally found something that works. i acutally wrote down different things from different websites and tried different settings until this thing worked. a pain, i know, but if i wasn't with VERIZON online i probably wouldn't have this problem.once set up, (and do not use the linksys cd, its worthless). you have to manually configure the router. 192.168.1.1 is default address.this is a great router,great speeeds and range. the only thing i hated was the setup. other than that im very pleased."
4,"Easy to set up, good connection, speedbooster does not make a difference.","This router is easy to set up with the included CD. The set up is very simple and takes only a few minutes. I did not experience any additional boost in speed with the speed booster, it works just the same as my older G band router.I prefer this router to the newLinksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Routeras it gives me a better signal in my 2-storey house. The WRT54G2 gave me a much weaker signal in the some spots than this one. During set up the CD also installs a Connection Advisor software on your computer that diagnoses and refreshes your connection in case you experience problems. It has come in handy a couple of times to connect to the internet especially as I use my laptop in multiple wireless locations and some times the settings can go awry.I got this router at a sub 40 dollar price at a big box electronics retailer. It's a bit more expensive on Amazon."
1,"Hey Dude, where's my Network?","Constant problems with the router ""FORGETTING"" my network. I have to set up my network again, and again. I have done it three times this week. The router acts as if I have never set up my network, and tells me a ""new network has been detected"". I end up going through the setup proces a few times a week. For some reason, it also sees three of my xbox 360s ... even thoghu i only have one. I would not recommend buying this."
4,Wireless Router,"The router works as expected and was easy to install with the exception of an inconsistency between the Linksys installation instructions and those supplied by the computer manufacturer. One call to Linksys resolved the problem. The Linksys set-up disc, distributed with the hardware, could easily be modified to provide the instructions supplied over the telephone."
5,Great product,"Got this router last week and instantly installed it with out any hassles. It was up and running in no time and was able to link to it with my wireless pci card WMP54GS(from linksys also). Had a big issue getting it to link with my wireless adapter for my laptop(WPC54GS), but the customer chat service guys at linksys where just terrific in assisting me to get it connected. Just needed to change the broadcast channel from the default channel 6 to channel 11. By the way, my systems where all running windows xp with sp2. Impressed with their customer care. Kudos to them."
1,"Can you say ""lemon""?","Obviously, I got the dud of the bunch - I tried installing it with a Mac, and was told by a whispering tech support lady that it couldn't be done with OS 9.2. Fine, so I upgraded the machine it was to be hooked to - still no dice. The second time, the help line was busy. The website support was useless too. So in a fit of desperation (and $30 later after buying an ethernet switch to do the job this thing was supposed to do) I put it on the lone PC in the network - ran the CD-ROM- and it failed at the last step - repeatedly. Again, tech support was on vacation when I called in.On the bright side, my compliments to Amazon for taking this lemon's return. At least they understand what customer customer service!"
2,Disappointing experience,"Well, in the end I found this to be a disappointing product. Though all features worked, every couple of weeks I must reset the router to regain wireless service. I've tried using different channels, but it always drops eventually. I did not have this problem with my older netgear router (though it was only a 802.11b router). I've recently purchased a Netgear WGT624 to see if it stays up longer.I have not tried the recently updated firmware (late october release), but the release notes do not mention any updates concerning wireless connection reliability."
2,do you feel lucky?,"I got the WRT54GS to replace the earlier WRT54G model after it suddenly died at a modestly respectable age. After wasting two days trying to get it configured so that it would work with two laptops and two desktops, with security enabled, I gave up and switched brands to the D-Link DI-634M. At various times I got the Linksys working with each of the computers, but then when I would get another one set up, the previous one might become unreliable. The last straw was when my newest laptop would connect to the WRT54GS router and then lose its connection and reconnect repeatedly, at some regular interval between five and ten seconds, like clockwork. If you're lucky, it is conceivable that this unreliable box could work for you, but I've had much better luck (and good speed and coverage) after switching to the D-Link."
1,DO NOT BUY! JUNK!,"Latest versions of this product are junk!Linksys had great product, WRT54GS, for years running Linux.Very stable. Very good. Community of 3rd-party firmware developers.In latest v5 version, Linksys threw away their advantages. Started over with new board, using new OS called VxWorks. Well, it doesn't actually WORK all that well but that's what they call it.So it is now a completely new and BAD piece of product unfortunately hiding in same piece of plastic as old product. So existing customer reviews of v4 and earlier should be ignored."
1,Parental control was important to me,"After some help from the tech desk, this thing works very well. The only problem is that I bought it partially because of the parental control. After using for a couple of years, I am getting a message now that reads:""The Linksys Parental Controls service is no longer accepting subscription renewals.We apologize for any inconvenience and encourage you to look for other Parental Controls options before your subscription expires""This is VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE- especially given that the parental control features are still be advertised. And frankly, anyone who has children with access to the net needs parental control if they plan on sleeping at night."
1,serious issues with setup,The product cannot be setup following the steps shown in the setup CD. I do find it very frustrating as i am not located in US and even calling up the toll-free technical support is not an option for me. Still struggling to get the router setup!!!
5,Experienced user finds no fault,"Easy to install, online support was excellent. This thing smokes the last router I used. I won't name the other brand, but it was Gear I bought on the Net. The Linksys product is faster, it doesn't overheat and more importantly has not had one service interuption in 10 days. The old product radiated enough heat to warm your hands and I lost internet service 8 to 10 times daily."
2,"Good Router, Rebate Refused","This is an excellent router, and you're gettting wireless service that doesn't randomly cut out like the Belkin ""free after rebate"" special I used to use.On the other hand, Linksys refused to honor my mail-in rebate for $10 for no apparent reason. Get it on sale for at least 10% off and don't screw around with Linksys rebates you'll never get back."
1,Disappointed,"Purchased the WRT54GS as an upgrade to Linksys BEFSX41 with an SMC 802.11b access point. Installed easily, but was very disappointed that with WEP and MAC filtering enabled the unit consistently drops connections after a few minutes in all available wireless modes (B-only, G-only, Mixed). It is indeed significantly faster than 802.11b for the short periods in which it holds the connection. ..."
1,DO NOT BUY - Faulty advertising and faulty product,"After 6 calls to tech support, they finally concluded the router software was bad. They asked that I go to their website to download the appropriate Firmware and when I went to their website, I found that version 5, which is what was required, wasn't available yet. I called back & let them know this, they checked and agreed that they had a product on the market that was not supported by the correct software. Their own tech people told me to take the product back and look for an older version. Not very comforting for a company the size of Cisco. Faulty product and untruthful advertising. Not a good combination. The entire attempt to get this setup was a miserable experience. DO NOT BELIEVE their packaging. There is no such thing as an easy setup...I have a day invested to prove it. Pass on Linksys and go with another well known product!!!"
1,by 'b' router works better,I replaced a linksys b router with this. This one stinks - always bouncing the signal - my old 'b' router works better than this - at least it keeps the signal connected and it works. Dont buy it......
2,Buzzing noise is driving me crazy.,"The Power Adapter which plugs into an electrical outlet makes a LOUD and annoying buzzing, humming sound. I've tried plugging it into other outlets and a power strip, but it is still loud. Anyone out there have any suggestions??? The wireless routing function seems to work ok. I had someone with professional experience install it for me so I can't comment on ease of set up. I'm certain I could not have done it myself. I noted that the instructions were for Windows only! The installation CD says it (the CD, not the router) will only run on certain Windows editions. I have an I-Mac and a new MacBook so that was useless to me."
3,Not Ideal for Macs,"This router was a pain-in-the-neck to install. There is little to no tech support for Macs. I finally found a user group that indicated it is necessary to use Firefox rather than Safari to access the online setup page, which helped only minimally. I still have not been able to get it to work with any of the security features enabled. I see no speed enhancement in using it as compared to other routers, so the extra money paid for that feature is hardly worth it."
2,Dropped signals,"After spending 30 minutes to set up, its range was very short and dropped signal in the bedrooms. After setting up a second time, the same problems. I was told Linksys has quality problems out-of-the box since the Cisco acquisition. I returned the unit and bought a Belkin wireless router. It worked the first time and the range was much longer and the singal was twice as strong."
1,wow. died in 4 years,3 year warranty.died in 4?im well versed in IT equipment.. and did all the troubleshooting i had to just to find that its dead 1 year after mfgr warranty ended.
5,Wonderful product,Bought this because my Dell Mobile router died. This thing was so easy to set up I thought I was doing it wrong because it was sooo easy. I was up and running in about 10 minutes.
2,Not Satisfied,"It does get both my desk tops to work, but it kicks me off line continueosly. I had to write this review 4 times. Not very happy."
4,Excellent,The router was simple to install and Linksys makes it easy to follow a step by step CD to connect your router to an existing network. I received this item from very fast. I received it before it was supposed to arrive. Great Job and Thanks.
5,Wireless Broadband Router,We had a different router and were unable to get a signal on the second floor of our house. Now with the Linksys WRTG54GS - coupled with a range expander - we get a strong signal throughout the house.Linksys customer service was very helpful. The router was simple to set up. We had some issues getting it and the range expander to work together.I recommend the router and Linksys.
5,Linksys WRT 54GS wireless-G router,"Excellent product. No problems in usage. Telephone support was spot on. I had two Belkins before. They both didn't last more than a year before developing glitches. Belkin tech support no help and tho they would replace it free, they wanted me to pay for shipping. No thanks, so I bought this Linksys instead."
1,Good at first...but watch out! Customer Serivce is terrible.,"I used this for my first true in-home wireless set up. Used the wireless, and the wired options. Windows Vista constantly drops connections with this router. As a ""wired"" setup it did just fine. It had a ton of nice features for security. I set up most of the Wireless LAN permissions, and even setup MAC-address filtering. I changed the SSID, re-established the user/pass settings.The last staw was at 15 months, when it just quit working for NO apparent reason. The really screwy part was that the ""hard reset"" button did not respond. I was willing to lose all of my custom configurations just to get online again, but that turned out to be too much to ask. So I did an online tech session with one of their CSRs...since it was over 12 months old they wouldn't help me. They offered to do an online diagnostic for $24.99. WTF?!?!?! So I dumped Linksys and now run Netgear WGR614 G/B. So far so good."
4,Router-Yes Tech Support- Good Luck!,"With any router you're going to end up calling tech support. And, in the words of SpongeBob SquarePants, ""Good luck with that."" In the case of our install we hade a huge language barrier to overcome and a ""tech"" who refused to honor our request for a supervisor with a working command of the English language. First request resulted in our being put on hold for 27 minutes, the second time we asked, the phone conversation was terminated. A third call got us competent help. I would hope the rude, incompetent tech was an anomoly.So....router good. Tech support, not so."
2,Why won't this thing set-up with my laptop?,I received this item and followed all of the instructions to set-up the secure network and tried to do this 6 times. It wouldn't work so I have been using it unsecured. Please contact me.
1,The worst router I have ever used,"This is such a crappy product. Once in a while, and I mean 3-5 times day, it will loose al conections. Sometime the wireless ones, and sometimes between the device itself and the DSL. All light will be blinking and all will look nice, except there is no conection. The only way to get it back is to go and power cycle the router and the DSL modum. Those thing should stay alive forever, not die on you 5 times a day."
4,"Good product, if you get a version 4 or below","This is a great product, so long as you can get version 4 or below. Linksys/Cisco have gone to a new system as of version 5 (same for the WRT54G) which does not have all the bugs ironed out yet. CGN7 serial numbers and up are version 5, CGN6 is 4, CGN5 is version 3. The versions below Version 5 will also allow you to run third-party firmware if you so desire. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G for more info."
3,"Good Performance, Decent Tech Service","Contrary to what other reviewers have written, there are errors in the install how-to. I called tech service twice to rectify the problems - the first tech was difficult to understand so we broke it off and I called again and got good, efficient help. We're running one desktop wired, one wireless and three laptops wireless and are not having any dropouts anywhere in the house, even 50 feet from the transmitter. I had been on the verge of buying the Belkin pre-n rig and I'm glad we saved the bucks - the Linksys stuff cost us about half since we got in on a good rebate deal."
2,Limited expandability for wirelss networking,"The features for the WRT54GS are impressive, but it still cannot provide the necessary functions for real networking solutions. If you want to have a wireless network with multiple routers in different rooms the connection has to be ""hard wired"" according to Rachelle (13384) at Linksys. The two wireless routers cannot bridge the gap and thus I will be looking at other options."
1,Junk,"Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBoosterI have been trying to install this router since 2/20/08 .I get it going An it may work for a day or so then quit.Tech support is non existent, they keep refering me to other web sites.My old router was a Linksys B and it was just as fast as the GS.The reset does nothing.I would recomend anybody thinking about purchasing this pruduct to think again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Connection times out,"Firstly, i am not new to networks, nor am i a novice to the procedures of setting up and maintaining a network. Sad to say though, but linksys has disappointed me. I bought this router mainly to provide internet to my playstation 3 for online game play. The wireless function i no longer use, as i thought that was the cause of the time outs. I tried plugging it though CAT5 expecting a difference in connection, but no luck. Its not an issue that is constant, it just happens every now and again. I would sometimes have to turn the router off then back on to get proper connection.Some people are lucky, and other are......well... me"
4,Better Than D-Link,"I have had the WRTG54GS for maybe 2 years without any trouble with the router until I added a slingbox and 7 wired and wireless network cameras accessible over the internet. Even then my only trouble is sporadic and only requires me to un-plug and re-plug in the router. I am not sure why this happens but I feel it may have something to do with the different camera types and slingbox or from some other programs I have running or their settings. This is a very easy router to setup and use as well as changing any settings.With 400 reviews you really dont need mine, but I also have a wireless D-Link router and I have had un-pleasant experiences with their tech support and just wanted to advise you to try and contact tech support and ask some questions before you buy anything. I have had some experience with U.S. Robotics wireless products in the past and they had great tech support at the time. Sorry I dont have time to go into details."
5,Awesome product,"Linksys is always a great product and in this case the WRT54GS is no exception. Installation is a piece of cake, works like a charm, and automatically sets up a secure network. Definitely worth the price."
4,"Ignore the ""easy"" start guide...","It does not apply for cable systems. Setup for this unit is NOT for the faint of heart, however, it IS a very effective appliance.Mike"
2,Mediocre,"I purchased this router along with the associated NIC cards so that I could take advantage of SpeedBooster. I had three computers sharing a wired connection in one studio but was about to move to a larger apartment where wiring would be a pain. Even in the studio the signal strength was inadequate. The computer furthest away from the router would default to my neighbor's WAP because it had a stronger signal. I also had problems in connecting between a computer that was wired into the router and a computer that connected wirelessly. Ultimately, after moving, the signal strength was simply too insufficient to create a reliable connection and I opted to run wires. As a side note, the software for the recommended NICs is very clunky especially for WEP using XP SP2. I am now using the router as a wired router only and it works fine and is very easy to configure."
5,hands down a solid product.,"I have bought about four of these router now. and i always look for them ..they never needed rebooting, alway keep your wi-fi up and running..WRT54GS models flashed with DD-WRT software is filled with functionality. This router has serious sercurity. I would buy this router again and again..if i ever need another"
2,[...],"The product works fine, but it was a little bit annoying to install. You should find a manual online for yourself. [...]"
1,Do NOT buy this router if you're wanting to use parental controls,"After 2 hours on the phone with Linksys (some of the worst customer service I have EVER experienced) I find out that they've removed Netopia router-based parental controls from v4 of this device without telling ANYONE. Even their web site still talks about its advantages. I know that it is a great router with lots of hackability, but I'm going back to Netgear."
2,Do Not Buy This Router for Parental Control Features,"I purchased this router for the parental control service that Linksys advertises on their website - one of the requirements to use this service is to purchase a WRT54GS - After purchasing this router I tried to subscribe to the service and received an error message so I contracted Linksys support. After checking I was told that my router was a ""version 4"" router and it was not supported, only the earlier versions were supported. I asked Linksys support what router I needed to purchase to use the parental support and they told me I would have to find an earlier model of the WRT54GS which is no longer available - If you want parental control options - DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!"
1,Fragile box and non-existant support,"Mine has worked for less than 2 hours. When I moved it to another outlet to improve signal pick-up, it ceased working becoming an ordinary hub. Support was impossible to contact, had to call its parent company (Cisco) to get an answer.The answer I got was that even though Cisco existed in Brazil, I would have to ship the thing to the US and they would only ship it back through UPS International Express (cost: $88 one way)."
5,Best router I have found,I have used several routers for wireless and voip and this one was the easiest to install. Following the instructions and everything worked perfectly. You can add up to 4 different wireless or voip. Great product.
5,Awesome Router,"I just installed it and have 3 computers surfing internet with no problems. I think this is a need in home and in work. This router is working with my Laptop, Celular Phone, My PC Card -Dlink (computer desktop) and USB Dlink (of my other computer desktop) and no problems."
2,I could have read it better myself!,"Usually I like everything written by John Saul. However, I chose to get this as an audio book. What a mistake! Sorry, Lee Meriwether, but not all men sound like they are 75 year olds from the South. The storyline was extremely difficult to follow, as I spent so much of my energy trying to separate the voice from the character. Also, the abridged version of the story was a major disappointment! Much of the storyline was omitted and the ending seemed choppy. Many of the details that might help readers become engrossed in the book were left out. How unfortunate. I almost want to also buy the hardcover book and read it myself to reinstate my faith in Mr. Saul. Oh, well, better luck next time"
4,"Reviewing ""The Presence""","I enjoyed this book a lot. I love John Saul's writing. His creativity and style surpass others. He is my favorite next to Dean Koontz. I liked this book for many reasons. For one, I liked the development of characters. His setting was perfect also, he placed a horror/suspense story in the tropical paradise of Maui! This book was very imaginative and is unique in his writing and others. I took one star off because of how slow the reading was for me, personally. It took me a while to get into the book. At the beginning of the book, the foreshadowing stories were awesome. I also was very indulged into the book because of the ties that were placed in the novel between archeology, anthropology, and even ""strange-alien pods"" under the sea. I loved the book, I'd read it again, Saul has a way of placing you in the novel as if you are there."
3,Doesn't follow Saul's usual technique.,"The Presence doesn't fail to entertain, but it falls short of the white knuckled suspence that faithful readers have come to expect. Previous Saul works have facinated readers with medical horrors. The Presence, while intriquing, doesn't quite leave the reader with their customary shivers after putting down one of Saul's books. For the first time reader, The Presence is a must read. Saul leaves the reader pondering the origins of mankind, and the mixture of medical, archaelogical, and astronomical sciences gives the reader plenty to think about. The Presence should be evaluated by each individual reader. But this faithful follower of Saul is left wondering if his next novel will be revived back to the horrificly suspence status she has come to expect."
2,The Presence,"Under beautiful Hawaiian beaches, danger is lurking below for scuba divers. One of Hawaii's wealthiest citizens is trying to achieve his goal by putting the lives of teenagers in jeopardy. The brilliant anthropologist, Dr. Katharine Sundquist, has unearthed an unusual skull that doesn't match anything that she is familiar with in her other diggings. Will she will be able to save her own son's life? The beach bum hacks into Yoshihara's elaborate computer system and sees what an evil man he is. Love finally seeps in toward the ending to make this story palatable. Not one of John Saul's best books!"
3,"Not his best, but very enjoyable nonetheless","I agree with one of the other reviews. Jeez, people! So critical! This was a fast-paced book, that kept me turning pages. It wasn't as scary as his others, but I was satisfied with the overall effort."
1,Amateurish and ludicrous,"This was a ridiculous and amateurish novel. This is my first John Saul book and will definitely be my last. Failing to be scary, thought-provoking, interesting, or even plausible, this book is a laughable attempt by Saul to move into science fiction. With only the knowledge of ninth grade biology class, I would be able to disprove nearly every scientific speculation in this sorry excuse for a book. Saul also neglected to include any of the basics of writing in The Presence, ie character, suspense, plot,etc. if you want science fiction/ suspense, try reading Michael Crichton or Robin Cook, not this wannabe."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I own every book written by John Saul and have thouroughly enjoyed them but The Presence was hard to follow. As a matter of fact, I was never able to force myself to finish it. Needless to say it was very disappointing. Not up to his normal excellence."
2,not too well thought out,"As far as suspensful, horror stories go, this one just tried to do too much. Too many story lines created too many perspectives, and by the end, when Saul tried to tie them together, it just never gelled. The villains were one dimensional, and the twists were a bit forced to say the least.This was my first John Saul novel, and I can't say that I would try another by him unless I was really desparate. Disappointing."
4,Typical John Saul horror mystery,"I enjoyed Saul's newest book. Although written simply and easy to read--it was hard to put down until you finished. Saul writes in present day horror with people you can relate to, although repetitious in places, you don't easily figure out where he is going which keeps you reading."
2,Ho Hum.,"Not one of the better books I've read from John Saul. It wasn't that scary and the book bogged down in parts. I never bought into the plot, it just seemed to far fetched. The villians were a little to James Bondish for me."
1,Two words -- DON'T BOTHER,"Nothing compared to other Saul novels. It seemed like he had an idea, but had trouble developing it."
1,An embarrassment ... don't waste your time or money,"The worst! This book is a complete bomb. Someone should remove the exclamation key from his keyboard, as he uses it constantly. (I was reminded of Elaine's editor on Seinfeld, who would have had a field day with this book.) The term ""the presence"" never appears in the book. How strange. How insulting!! How can I inappropriately use more exclamation marks to thoroughly trash this piece of dreck?!!"
2,Interesting premise - 2.5 Stars,"Out of all Saul's bks. I've read this is one of my least favorite. This bk. is more Sci-fi-ish & Saul just isn't my favorite. when it comes to science fiction or ""speculative fiction."" Plus, it had the usual troubled teenager theme & I've grown a bit tired of that theme.On a positive note - this is good for young adults & is fairly ""clean"" (has ""bad"" words). My 12yr old loved this bk. & gives it 4 stars."
3,Left me searching for more...,"I adore John Saul's work. He is a fantastic author, and his use of science and its possible evils are twisted and formed into great reading. However, The Presence left me empty. I breezed through the first half in no time- great story! But about 3/4 of the way into it, I realized that I had already figured out the rest of the book. I spent the last pages nodding my head, and waiting for a surprise- unfortunately, nothing came. I loved the setting and his description of Hawaii, and his characters were likeable, as always. Promising story...but doesn't fulfill the promise."
1,Dissapointing,"Im glad this was the fourth Saul book that i read, because if it was the first i would not have bothered with his other books.I loved the other three, but this one does not live up to the usuall John Saul quality. I found it difficult to pick up and read, almost an effort."
1,boring!!!,"I started this book a few days ago after getting it from the library. The summary of the book makes it sound so interesting, the archaelogist, hawaii, etc. I was terribly let down by this book. I read as much as I could and only made it to page 70 when I gave up. By then it was going nowhere. Just about a boy who was getting bullied around, and a woman inspecting some bones found beside an inactive volcano in hawaii. Where is the chill? where is the supsense? This book sucks. I want to read one of Saul's disturbing tales about children. Donot waste your time on this book. I am now reading faces of fear, and it is much more interesting."
3,"Neat idea, cheesy ending",Cool idea for a story and some neat reading all the way through. But the ending was to easy. It seemed like John Saul was coming close to the deadline for this book so he ended the story with a blob of lava.
4,TYPICAL SAUL,"SAUL'S LATEST EFFORT IS A GOOD,FAST READ. THE INTRODUCTION OF A HEROINE WAS A WONDERFUL ADDITION. I ALSO BELIEVE IT WOULD MAKE A GOOD MOVIE."
4,Not bad at all,"This was my first Saul book, and I was expecting a horror book. What I got was a mystery thriller type of story that didn't disappoint. Saul goes along and gives the reader just as much information as the heroine gets, so you don't know exactly whats going on untill she does. This is about average people being put into a horrible situation, and it works well. If you're looking for a good read, you could do worse than this book!"
5,One of Saul's most unusual books--lots of fun!,I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I never expected the ending and thought the whole concept was quite unique. Kept me up two nights in a row!
3,The geology was very interesting.,"The geology information was very well done and interesting. I found the book very similar to Nevada Barr's books. The main character is in the wilderness on her own, encounters physical dangers, is badly injured but is able to persevere and is successful in solving the crime and recovering. Too many villians."
2,Susan G Komen 3 Day motorcycle Crew member,"I bought these for my husband to use to decorate his Harley for the Susan G Komen 3 Day for the Cure in Seattle. He works on the Route Safety Crew keeping we walkers safe at intersections and elsewhere on the route. The did the job but are very flimsy! I am not actually sure what other people use these for, but they are a one-time use item for our purpose. I expected them to be more solid, or better made."
1,whiskey tango fox,Holy garbanzo beans batman. After 15 minutes of the two women dithering I had to turn it off. I had high expectations for this movie and the topic to be covered. When I watched the two of them just describe hemlock instead of showing it i knew i would be better off on my own with an Army field manual (they have pictures). If you can stomach to watch more than 20 minutes of these ladies you're up for sainthood. They seem way to flighty to ask for the time of day let alone what is poison and what is edible. Spoiler Alert: this movie is a waste of money.
3,"Usually buy white or beige, ordered different color. It was smaller,","Like the style, have worn it for quite a few years, but have to watch the size, band and cup,"
2,NOT pairs!,"As a previous reviewer stated, you do NOT get pairs of buds in this kit. You get ONE of each size for each of the three types; foam, firm plastic & soft rubber.If you need to replace both buds, you'll need two of these kits.My review score reflects the fact that nowhere in the information does it tell you this. The logical assumption is that there would be pairs supplied and that the picture is just representative of the sizes/types.The actual product is fine. Exactly what came standard with my Shures."
2,small but weak,"Kudos to Sony for making a small, dazzle your friends type camera. But how many wasted shots have I taken? Endless. At least 1/3 of the pics from this camera come out blurry, incredibly dark, or with red eye from hell (even w/ red eye flash setting). To be fair, it handles still close-ups just fine but any action shot forget it. Folks, this is a novelty camera that's not worth its pricetag IMHO."
4,Wonderful Little Camera,"I got this camera a few weeks ago, and I love it. I read a ton of reviews of ""micro"" cameras before deciding on this one and it drives my nuts when someone says ""The quality sucks compared to my Mofo 6000 Digital Camera from Canon that cost me $2000"". It is not a super high quality camera, how could it be, it costs $200?!?!It is tiny, it fits in your pocket and it takes nice little pictures. It has some neat features such as burst and movie mode w/o sound.The biggest thing though is the size. I thought that the absence of an optical viewfinder would drive me nuts, but I haven't really noticed. If you order this camera, go ahead and order a new memory card with it. The 8MB one it ships with doesn't hold many 2MP pictures though it will hold about 70 shot on VGA (perfect for Websites and E-mail).A great purchase."
1,great product; TERRIBLE seller,"Good bandages that were exactly what I expected. The size and shape were exactly as advertised. Strong fabric is comfortable and lasts. WARNING! Do NOT buy from Medical Products Depot!!! They collect your money WEEKS before bothering to ship, and then are VERY rude in their email replies when you inquire about your shipment offering NO response until after the product was finally delivered, no apologies, no excuses, no compensation. By the time I received the product, it was no longer needed."
2,2/5,"Me and my wife bought this and were immediately disappointed on its arrival. It is barely loud enough to hear while in the same room, and it still manages to sound distorted. It only works witha few devices ass well."
4,Worth the Bucks!,Good for it's size. I use at the office and it works like a charm. I get to listen to my tunes without imposing on my neighbors.
3,book tries to put in a lot,Book tries to put in a lot but makes kinda confusing and then just not that interesting to read. For my part I found it a bit dry and long. There was more spend on the backdrop than I felt the characters. Then since I didn't feel the characters when I was reading the book I just lost interest.
5,Quality God Rock Thumping Music!!!,"I stumbled onto these guys by doing a Google search for some quality celtic christian punk/rock for my nieces boyfriend and by doing so found MY new favorite band of the year! I LOVE the rock thumping drums and echoing versitility of the bagpipes, mandolin, guitar, and the like. The lyrics and vocals are equally subperb. And I love how some songs on the album use spoken vocals with an ""old record flare"" then follow it up with a pounding message and foot stomping blare.Personal favorites are track 6. ""Hoity Toity""...great lyrics, makes you want to stomp your feet, with fist in the air and shout 'Wake Up!' Track 14. ""Same Ol' Story"" for its pure heartfelt lyrics with a ""pub sing along"" feel. And the title track is also A+ without a doubt. I can't remember the last time I listened to an album so well compiled of songs and quality of sound. You boys ROCK!!!"
4,Marvel does it again!!,"Sup everyone,I just got this game a while ago from a good friend of mine, i have always been an X-men fan! This game gets 2 thumbs up from me. I have played other X-men games but this I think is the best. The graphics arnt amazing but they get a 95%to me. The charactors attacks are really cool, most of them are hard to do and it gets a little frustrating but its not impossible, i really havnt gotten to far on the game but i try to use all the charactors to get a feel for it. The training part of the game isnt that fun and it takes a long time to learn the charactors main and most powerful attaks. Like rouge, it took me foever to learn how to obsorb life and alot of stroms attacks are difficult to. But other than about 2 or 3 flaws the game has i think its a great buy.*phoenix*"
4,X-men Next Dimension,"Good game for what it is and the time that it was made. I think the cinemas are neat to view, the ones you unlock as you play are even cooler. the unlockable players add a bit more to the game also. I wish these characters were in an actual adventrue game with these abilities and the way they look, that would rock even more. plus i get to play with my favorite character 'the pheonix"" and her more powerful and vengeful counterpart ""the dark phoenix"". I'm thinking there should be a game that chronicles, the phoenix's rise in Jean and protecting the M'kron crystal.......and maybe the rise and taming of the dark phoenix, I'd pay a couple of hundred dollars for that one."
2,Don't waste your time!,"Don't buy it! Now, don't get me wrong . . . there is much to like about this game. the background is great, the characters are fabulous, and the control is not actually t makes this game absolutely terrible is the AI. As you progress through the story mode or arcade mode, you'll come up on random characters that you just cannont beat (sentinel A and havok come to mind). the computer is mind-boggingly cheap, throwing out combos and blocking everything, even on easy. Rent the game, get the ""unlock everything"" code, watch the movies, and take it back."
2,poor game play,"orginally, the idea of an x-man title had a strong appeal. however, this game's lack of fluid movement and disappointing game play quickly became a frustration. the animation is choppy at best. while the characters had potential, they just didn't come alive. also, the load time between stages is abismal. finally, the chacters weren't well balanced. i would definately think about renting this game, but avoid purchasing it."
4,master p is bitchen' dude,I think that master p is one of the best rappers besides mase. He has a smooth flow.Ilike his videos because of the hoes.
1,Yo dis cd be da bombest of da bomb!,"Dis CD be da coolest cd. I can really identify wit him, cuz I cumz from the ghetto, and I really think hes bin there. This cd be ok, cuz he can be trippin, steppin', and lunchin' all at the same time!"

5,THE TJ TRANNY IS QUIET! FINALLY!,"We were sick of hearing the NV3550 being so loud, so I decided to flush my tranny and add this product. Let me tell you there was no difference, initially. After about my next oil change, 3000 miles or so, the trans had become significantly quieter and smoother shifting, especially 2->3 gear, which is very loud in the NV3550. I highly recommend this product."
4,Love this stuff,"I like RP and they make quality fluids. I use them throughout my car and have never had anything bad to say about it. I have had their trans fluid in my car for the past 30,000 miles and it has worked well. Towards the end of the service life (30,000 miles) I was having some minor grinding when going into reverse but only when the car was cold and the air was cold (under 45 F). I just bought more to change out the old fluid."
5,An order I never received,"Wow, this really takes a long time, I order a product, it came with free shipping(great), it took 14 days to get to my (area),next stop would have been at my door, it never made it that far. It seems the shipment was damaged in transit, so I followed it for 7 more days to return to (where it was shipped from)then waited 5 more days for a refund? If I had wanted a refund I would not have ordered the product in the first place. The solution to this case would have been to reship expidite (overnight) the item I wanted from the time you new it was damaged. I still want this item, but I will not wait the periods of time these transactions seem to take, we are in the computor age, correct? There is nothing at all wrong with the item, just the service part of this organization. Dennis C. Harrington"
4,Synchromax Transmission oil,"My BMW has 100000 miles on it and according to my timetable, it was time to drain out the old 'lifetime' Manual transmission oil and replace it.The Synchromax is the same GL rating (I think it's GL4) as the original BMW oil. I noticed no change in the shifting- it was smooth to begin with and smooth after the change. It is after all gear oil. I plan to change it again at the next 100,000 mile mark. If the BMW makes it that far, I'll raise my rating to 5 stars, but until then, 4 stars is my limit. I used this in my transfer case as well. No complaints. I have heard people say that Royal Purple cures all your ailments, but so far no evidence of that in my case. Just a high quality replacment for the original part."
3,Synchro ok,"It does shift really smooth, the only problem I had was that the pump doesn't go to the bottom of the bottle, which is really annoying. And it's not like ""oh my god!"" its just ok."
2,Royal Purple Synchromax fluid,"What ever you do, DO NOT spill this while you're filling your trans! If you do make sure you wipe it up completely. This oil has a TERRIBLE smell and when it gets hot it gets worse. Google 'royal purple Synchromax smell'. I'm thinking of changing back to GM stuff, can't get rid of the odor inside the car."
5,Great Transmission Fluid for your BMW,"I drive a 2001 BMW 540i - 6 speed manual trans. The car has accumulated 131k miles on it and none of the previous owners have changed out the transmission fluid, as per BMW recommendation saying that the fluid is ""lifetime."" Lifetime really means warranty time, and after so many years all E39 5-series cars are out of warranty. After opening both plugs, fill and drain, on my transmission the old OE fluid was DARK, and brown, generally gross looking, surely not a scientific analysis, but anyways. The two quarts of new RP Synchromax that went in made a HUGE difference in how the shift feels. Shifting is buttery smooth. This is why I'm giving the product I'll probably change it out 40k miles from now."
5,Can a Girl Run for President?,"It is a truly remarkable book and it is high time someone wrote it. It calls on all females to be courages and step out to use their full potential in order to make a difference in the world. It offers practical ideas of how to go about unlocking this potential and how to develop ones personality and to use ones powers effectively to the good of all. The author has tremendous insight into the human psyche and appears to be genuine in her endeavour to call out to each and everyone of us, to do what it takes to make this world a better place to live in."
3,DON'T GET THIS,"IF you have a computer get mech warrior 4-not this. IT is missing a lot and the ruined the whole bettletech uneverse. you can't even customize mechs!basically compaired to mech warrior 4;-a lot of stuff was left out-some stuff was added but more was taken out.-graphics are slightly better but not much at all.-both have great multiplay over the internet, however if you have a 56k, again get mech 4-it is not laggy-explosions are better in mech assault, and you get hurt from them.-building damage is amasing in assault.if you are a true battletech fan don't bother with this game. they changed the weapones aroung and added stupid powerups that you can get while you are playing. they made up a bunch of new weapones to take the place of old ones. and they added this stupid thing called a lava cannon.you don't get nearly as much controls so it makes for a much more simple game over all"
1,Do Not Buy This Game,"If you look at how many people are selling this game used you can tell that it stunk. Anyone who is a hard core MechWarrior fan will agree with me. The idea for MechWarrior by the orignal game designer was a game to be played on a COMPUTER with a JOYSTICK and not a gamepad. Also the to fire the PPC you shouldn't have to hold the butten to let them recycle, you should be able to fire right away.(this feature should really be for the bombast laser). The one thing that I did like about this game is that the weapons are made by different conmanies ie arrow IV missles. TO sum it up this game fall short of expatations and Microsoft should do something about it."
1,Boring......,"This is the most boring game I've ever played. I got really sick of blowing up buildings after the first 10 minutes. Going on line was even worse. You pretty much just run around in circles trying to kill people. I don't know how this won the Game of the Year award. Maybe it's fun for little kids, but for anyone who's enjoyed a game like Tribes, I think you'll find Mech Assault to be extremely boring."
3,The game is O.K.,"The game is fun but I wish I rented it before I bought it cause I'm kinda disappointed. It only took me a day to beat the game so I'm kinda bummed, I don't feel I got my fifty bucks worth out of it. The graphics are fun and good to look at however the game play isn't all that I had hoped it would be. No matter what Mech I choose, I get three similar weapons to use in battle and the action is pretty much the same even thought I choose a different Mech.If you enjoyed the Mech games on the PC I think you'll be pretty unsatisfied in the way this game plays. My advice again is rent it before you buy it. I would have only gave this game 2 stars but the graphics are better than most games I've played on X-box so far."
4,Great Graphics and Awesome Multiplayer,"To start off, Mechassault has some of the greatest explosions I have seen on the Xbox yet. Everything is destructible, everything is flammable, and everything looks beautiful. The single player mode is fun for a while, but gets a bit old after 5 or 6 missions. The most fun part of the missions is destroying the other mechs. They are the most difficult enemy in the mission, and are usually matched closely to your own mechs abilities.Where this game really shines is the multiplayer and online capabilites. There is almost never slow down on the broadband connection. The free-for-all battles are great, and are very challenging to beginner and veteran alike. The multiplayer is just as good, especially with system link play.Mechassault is a great buy if you have a broadband connection. If you're a fan of mech games, you'll like this game even if you don't have a broadband connection. Maybe one of the best games for Xbox Live yet."
4,the thrills won't last forever,"Mechassualt was released for the sole purpose of being an exclusive Xbox Live title. It does a lot of things well: great graphics, good soundtrack and soundeffects, and it uses the liscense very well. The multiplayer modes are amazing too where you can use broadband, system link, or local console modes. This all sounds good but the fun just doesn't last. With only 3 different weapons for each mech, things get kind of boring. There is a great variety of mechs but they basicly have the same moves. Another aspect of the game which is done poorly is the campaign mode. It is rather short and for most the difficulty is very hard. I know it sounds like a lot is wong with this game but if you are a dier mech fan (unlike me) this could be your favorite game."
3,"Fun, but hard to call MechWarrior","As someone who has been with this and the BattleTech franchises from the very beginning (yes including the FASA paper games), my main complaint with this game is the lack of customization capability for your Mechs.. Forget about it, b/c it just isn't here.. You'll get to choose between pre-set Mechs and that's largely it.That being said, the game is graphically impressive and it IS fun running around blowing everything up. It's a good one for the ""ooOOoo"", ""Ahhhhh""s of watching a skyscraper fall OUTSIDE of real life.."
4,Awesome robots and giant explosions,"Mech Assault is a fun game. There are two main modes: Campaign and Multiplayer. Both are fun but I like Multiplayer better. Under multiplayer there are many types of games such as tag, destruction, and grinder. There are also a lot of different stages like River City and Junkyard.There is a wide variety of Mechs too. From fast to slow and from strong to weak. All of them have three types weapons. They are ballistic, energy, and missile. The ballistic weapons are like your macheine guns. The energy weapons are the strongest. Those are your lasers and of course the missile weapons are missiles. They also have special abilities like flying, becoming invisable, and shooting out chaffs. They are all very useful. This game is very fun and is worth every dollar! I think it's the best fighting Xbox game I've played."
4,"If you liked MechWarrior, you'll love this!","I got Mech Assault with my Xbox. I was really surprised how cool this game is! It was a little difficult to catch on to the controls at first, but now, fighting tanks and other mechs is no problem. I played MechWarrior role-playing game in high school so this really caught my attention. I really like the being able to destroy buildings and impact my environment. Also, as you progress, you get a selection of Mechs to choose from.I highly recommend this game, IT ROCKS!"
3,i loved this game,i have spent hours and days on this gome i would buy it for anyone i have my copy and it has ben used almost in to extektion
2,No Challenge,"This game is actually an okay game to play once in a while. The controls are intuitive, well placed and the graphics are outstanding.My problem lies in the gameplay. It takes absolutly no skill whatsoever to play this game. You have rockets which automatically home in on their targets, so it takes no skill to shoot other people, and it takes no skill from other people to shoot you. Such as the mechs are slow moving, you might as well be just standing still and shooting each other to see who dies first.If you are used to First Person Shooters, and like the speed, agility and skill in a game, this one is not for you."
3,not as good as I hoped...,"When I first saw the game I just couldn't stop thinking about it now I think I could have done without. The game it self actuwally is a good idea like the graphics and all but the story line just down right stinks its basiclly fight, fight, fight! and thats it kill this bad dude and defend the base. There is a nice verity of things to kill and meches to use but there are not very many diffrent veichels to drive. Another thing when you replay levels you have the same mechs that you did when you originaly played them.I sugest that you first rent or borrow this game before you bye it I made that mistake and I do not want you to too.I hope this review was helpful for you"
3,OK game,I bought this for my Grandson and he likes it and wanted it. The shipper was fast and delievered as promised.
2,Its missing..... oh yeah the FUN!!,"This isn't a bad game and I'm sure people new to the series will enjoy it. But be warned if you're looking for the type of gameplay you'd expect from a 'mech game (mechwarrior 3 & 4) you are out of luck. You cannot mod your 'mech (thats right not at all). In most missions you can't even choose which mech to go into battle with. Phantom Crash might be a better choice for those of you out there that enjoy a little more freedom in gameplay. The only reason to purchase this game is if you have XBOX live, otherwise you'll soon be bored of the 19 levels this game has to offer."
1,NOT Mech Warrior!,"If you have played the original Mech Warrior on the PC DO NOT waste your money on this one!I grew up playing FASA's Mech Warrior on the PC. Too bad FASA went out of business and Micro$oft bought some of their games.The only thing this game has in common with the original game is in the name and concept; as far as game play is concerned it SUCKS! Mech Assult is no where near what the original PC game was and is a total disappointment.I have found that a lot of games that are supposed to be so great on the XBox are a disappointment when compared to the older PC and Play Station-1 games. Yes the graphics on the XBox are great but the content is lacking; too bad some of the old game programmers are not around anymore to write games for the XBox, it could be so great but..."
3,BETTER HAVE XBOX LIVE,unless u have xbox live or are planning to get it soon this game is only good for rental. The graphics r very nice but the replay value is very low. you'll find urself finished with the game in a day or 2. the only levels fun enough to replay is the first half of the game because the 2nd half is in a sloppy looking volcano environment. u can play multiplayer mode but unless u have 3 other people its not as fun. there r only a few maps and a few modes which get old fast. i do not have xbox live and probably won't be getting it anytime soon and there is downloadable content like maps and new mechs and it kind of [stinks] that i will be missing out on those. so just just rent this game b4 u plan on anything else
3,Mech Assualt a Armored Core [copy],"If you played Armored Core before on the PS2, you've noticed that this game looks alot like Armore Core1, execpt the explosions look prettier, and you can destroy the buildings. Armored Core has this game beat though because of it's tournament battle mode not offerd on Mech Assualt, Yes it does go live but even these levels are plain in comparison, my Opionion you can have more fun playing Armored core and design your own robot from color to alot of various weapons, on Mech Assualt you only have basically 3 diffrent weapons! All in all Mech Assualt is a incomplete version of Armored Core1 that can be played onlne. Armored Core3 is out for PS2, wow, if only this went online!"
3,DECENT MECH FIGHTER,"Mechassault by Microsoft puts you in the pilot seat of a giant Mech, going on various missions in a campaign. The game is now packaged with the Xbox live starter kit and is a great deal within that package.The Graphics are very good, especially the explosions, and you can interact with much of the scenery. While there is a great deal of mechs you can get, I would like to have seen a better variety of weapons.You can download addl. mechs and maps online. Online play is very smooth. play in arenas with every player for himself or in teams. A number of different game options are available making it one of the better online Xbox games."
3,"Fun, but tiring","This is a very fun game at times. You get to destruct all you've ever wanted. However, it gets very tiring because you find yourself blowing the same things up with a very small variety of weapons. The best thing to do is rent this game first, and then decide if you wold like to buy it. Then, if you like it, might as well spend the mere $20 to buy it."
4,BEST GAME EVER,"For those of you that liked other MechWarrior games well, this is beter than all of them combined. It has about sixteen solo player missions or so. This game features a wide variety of 'Mechs and maps (you need win some and download others to get them all). I beat the game in less than a week,but it never gets old!!This is the best game on Live! If you have Live, you won't play much UNLESS YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE!!!"
4,Great Music,The Virtual Audio Project is currently out of print. I know Amazon has some of their cd's still in stock I would encourage anybody that likes Electronic music to give it a try.
2,OMG BAD,this game if realy hard. and its not fun you have to play as hummans to unlock dragons. as a human you kill dragons and vice a versa. the game has a bad story and poor camera controls. making it hard. nothing notable about the game itself.
3,"Good recipes, poor editing","I've made several of the recipes in this book and all were very good. However, the book is poorly edited and instructions are not always clear. For example, the tofu cheese cake recipe does not specify what temperature to set the oven to. And you really do need a spring-form cake pan for it to turn out properly. The Key Lime Pie recipe was very confusing and I had to throw out the first batch of filling I made. I am not an expert cook but can generally follow recipes without any trouble. Chef Sato should have added a little more explanation and double-checked the recipes to be sure all the vital information was there. Buy this book only if you have time to remake the recipe if it doesn't turn out or are an experienced cook who can read between the lines and figure out what needs to be done."
5,They Will never know its good for them!,Great book .. with great recipes... make em and watch people eat them up......But dont tell them there Vegan and good for them.. They will never know.....
5,Educational,"This is a good buy. Hours of fun and very educational. Be careful with it though, it is very lightweight. Great for a responsible child who tries to keep their things in nice condition. Definitely recommend."
3,Bratz Laptop,"This is a nice learning tool, however the screen is small and therefore my child will only play with it for short periods of time. It does though have many activities to choose from."
4,Track Listing,Here are the 19 tracks:1 Intro 0:532 Let Me 4:563 Speaker Typhoon 2:584 The Discjockey 4:255 Bass For Your Face 3:216 Acid Action 4:337 Nightmare Of Disco 3:078 On The Spot 3:499 Southern Tribal Stars 4:3010 Hanabi 4:5711 Jack You All 4:1312 Hikiwari 5:1313 Get Down To My Loop 1:1014 Mic Robo 3:5815 Rockin' Onna 1:5016 Miss Controller 6:1617 Baby Dub 4:1218 Time To Roll 2:3519 Seed 5:45UPC: 4582117984146
4,Good Movie when you are in need of pick me up,This is an enjoyable movie staring George C Scott and William Petersen. Fans of William Petersen this is a very well played role for him. Believable carracters.
3,Deadly Currents,"I am a very big fan of Billy (William) Petersen. I initially bought this one because I thought it was a continuance of the character he played in another movie (CIA Exiled). Turns out this is the same movie under a different name. This movie was also under the name ""Curacao"". Fairly decent movie, with good performances by both Petersen and also George C Scott. If you are a fan of William Petersen, then this is a movie you can add to your collection. Although I would recommend if you prefer a DVD of it, then look for ""CIA - Exiled"" instead."
4,e-reader review,"I'm loving this game so much, I would recomend this to anyone. This game/accesory is vary helpful because you can cary your favorite games in a couple cards. One of the best things about this is you can swap cards with your friends."
4,A good way to play classic games wherever with few flaws,"This is great even if you have the NES games. For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn't have 2 player mode. It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP. The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time. Still, that won't stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them, its nothing. But the e-Reader does more than NES games; you may play e-Readers from Nintendo Magazines, you can play Game & Watch games, look at Pokemon (who cares about that feature???), connect to games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and get power-ups as well as new levels, and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience. The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn't too much of a problem. Also, e-Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City. Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals, too."
2,A waste of money,"This is for installing cheats into the Nintendo handheld games. If that is what you want to do, then go for it. Otherwise this is a waste of money."
5,"please, help me!!!!","Hi! I'm french and I would like to know if the e-reader works with a french gamecube, if someone knows it, just tell please!!!Because the e-reader will certainly not exist in France...Tell me please!Thanks!"
1,still dont have,its been since decemerand still have not recevied my items.whats going on i orderd thid for christmas and still not here.pleas help
2,I Got Ripped Off,"I got this gadget dingydoo for 5 bucks at Blockbuster and thought it would be a good deal. I figured out why this game was only 5 dollars. I didn't get a complete set of the Donkey Kong thing. I got 6 cards but 2 were just dang repeats. So, I can't play that. The cards can't be scanned easily and often take about 10 tries to make it actually work. The Pokemon cards you scan through only gives you info you already have on the card and the Animal Crossing cards are useless if you don't have a Gamecube. Manhole stinks because it is no fun. And yes it does work on the GBA SP, some people say it doesn't, but I guess they just don't have an SP or used it on their Gamecube without one of those link cables. So, you either can't play something, can't play something fun, or look at information that you can get by looking at the stupid card. But, with a price of $5.00, (at Blockbuster) I have no choice to give this stupid piece of junk a worthless 2."
3,NOT compatible with Game Boy Advance SP!,"The e-Reader is a cool idea, and I like mine, but I wish I hadn't bought it one week before I upgraded to a Game Boy Advance SP.The e-Reader plugs into the Game Boy Advance's cartridge slot and link cable slot. Since they are right together on a GBA, that works.On a GBA SP, the cartridge slot is on the bottom and the link cable slot is on the top; there's no way to plug in the e-Reader.So, if you're planning to upgrade to GBA SP, don't bother buying an e-Reader.(It's also tricky to use a Game Boy light with the e-Reader, since most of them either plug into the link cable slot or cover it.)"
2,Drags on with lots of distractions: Titillation isn't enough,"I found this Thompson book to be a pain. It is too long. She tries too hard to make the plot exciting and in the process can easily turn a reader off as they try to figure who's on first. There are too manycharacters and contrived events that seem often disjointed. While sex holds the couple together, in their first ""encounter"" somehow I knew how Farley was dressed as he enters her room. But somehow I didn't pick up on the garb that Zoe was wearing until deep into the interaction. He seemsclumsy at times and she pushes too hard to stay up with him, even though her heart won't admit there is at least sexual love. Even the end seems a bit contrived, when one finally reaches it. I like Nerd stories. Yet even a prime steak can be presented ""overdone."" This book is more Gone than nerdy!"
3,No photo gallery,"Front Page was producing errors when using photo gallery in certain circumstances. Simple solution, just drop photo gallery from next upgrade and don't mention it anywhere."
2,Expression Web update from Front Page,This product is a disappointment. Many of the fine features of Front Page have been removed.
1,Too advanced for my skills,"I found Microsoft Frontpage98 easy to use for my ameture skills. I created a good useful, professional site. I am finding myself very intimidated with the new ""Expression Web"" upgrade. I haven't yet installed it for fear of not being able to successfully import and update my current website. It seems to be geared for the professional website creator. I am keeping the program in hopes that I will be able to use it eventually."
3,Good idea to keep FP 2003 and/or NP or if you hand code!,"For this to be their language - ASP. Net (Aspx) 'Not Much Support for it - writing ASP. NET Code?' And for ASP. NET Controls you will need 2.0V installed on the server in order to use and 'Visual' is needed or the Visual Express Edition?The EW(R) task pane/s by default - Apply Styles and Tag Properties should be together or stacked one above the other.With Front Page Extension being phased out according to - ''it wouldn't be a good idea to use a DWT (Dynamic Web Template)."" Why even include it?"
2,Crash-O-Matic,"Microsoft's decision to embrace HTML standards is good news. Unfortunately Expression Web is a poor implementation of that decision. Too many simple things are difficult to do, but more importantly it crashes remarkably often when running on Vista. It is unfortunate that Microsoft has not issued any updates to correct this obvious and significant problem."
4,Great Upgrade,"With the FrontPage products in the past, Microsoft accomodated the beginner to novice web designers. With Expressions Web they have added the most advanced users to the list without losing the beginners. Great product!"
2,Expressio vs Frontpage,I bought this product hoping to get more that i was out of Frontpage for my website. It seemed to difficult for me to use.
2,Just don't get it,"I purchase this after using Frontpage 2003 for what seems forever! I've gotten good use out of FP, and it has more than paid for itself. But I'm just not sure what to make of Expression Web. I installed it, tried out some of the learning tools, but it just didn't click. I currently use a program that costs me 1/3 the price and has all the features of Expression Web. I also continue to use FP for basic stuff, especially when I need straight HTML programming.I've gone to MS website and read some of the tutorials, checked out their forum, etc. But it seems as if MS wants me to buy all these add-on's (like Adobe does) to get the program to do what it should already do. Personally, I think I wasted my money on this, and sorry I purchased it."
1,Same or worse than Frontpage,Wasted my money!!! Expression actually had fewer of the features than Frontpage that I personally wanted (i.e. they took out photo galleries) and it didn't even fix some of the bugs that have plagued me (it still crashes when trying to publish large websites). I have uninstalled Expression and am back to using Frontpage and am looking around to see if there is some other program that will meet my needs (a non-professional web designer needing wysiwyg for large websites).
3,Microsoft Expression Web,"I do simple web development and editing and Frontpage worked just fine. Expression Web has lots of power, but has some bugs when running on Windows Vista. The application often ""hangs"" when trying to open a web site. Once you restart the Expression Web it runs okay. My operating system is Windows Vista Home Premium. I note that in some forums Expression Web users are experiencing the same problem."
2,Expression Web Crashes A Lot,I bought the upgrade version of Expression Web and installed it on a computer with Vista Ultimate. It crashes often. I loose work whenever it crashes if I don't save constantly. Micrsoft seems to release software before it is perfected. This causes alot of grief for people who use computers for a living. Expression Web is different from FrontPage 2003 in many ways. Expect a two week education curve in order to use EW. I've heard of problems with Expression Web and XP as well. Microsoft is getting a rather bad reputation that will lead people to buy elsewhere...
2,Stripped Down,"I tried it. Found that many of the features I relied on with Frontpage were gone. The style gallery was stripped bare, Webbots had vanished (hit counters, etc.) and everything relied on non-existent style sheets. That's probably great for the geeks who do their taxes in hex but I was looking for drag and drop simplicity... I didn't find it with the replacement for Frontpage.In general, I prefer to use Microsoft products. In this case, I was forced to switch to Dreamweaver 8.Sorry, Bill, your folks missed the target with this one."
4,A Good Disc,I really Enjoyed this Disc.Chuck Jackson has Alot Of Soul In His Voice.Any Day Now is The Cut.He Puts alot Of Feeling into This material.It is a Good Solid Disc.
2,Didn't last very long.,"Well, I really liked this toaster when I got it. It works well and I liked the design. I've only owned it for about a year and a half. It's not like I make toast every morning, so imagine my surprise when it completely stopped working for no apparent reason yesterday. It's outside of the manufacturer's one year warranty, but it has probably been used less than 20 times. I would not purchase another Oster toaster."
1,Danger. Be aware.,"Think twice before buying this toaster, especially if you have smaller children. The sides get extremely hot, hot enough to give blistered burns.There is a lift lever that is supposed to raise items to a safer height but it only raises them a fraction of an inch, not enough to safely remove bagels or english muffins."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"This toaster takes forever to toast, and when the toast is finished it is dried and crunchy. I tried all the different settings and nothing works to prevent this. The outside of this toaster gets extremely HOT, so caution is advised when using it!! The feature that lifts the bagel or muffin for easey removal is a joke, I have burned my fingers numerous times. My advice is to purchase a DIFFERENT brand toaster!!"
1,It was toast after year & half.,"We purchased this toaster due to its looks,features and brand name. Worked great for 1.5 years then one morning nonething. Was used for less than a year since we are gone so much. Don't waste your money."
4,Great lamp set in a single box,I needed a few lamps to spruce up a room and these were perfect. Nice contemporary style and steel finish. The shades are of decent quality too. The only drawback is that I'd like the floor lamp to be a bit taller.
4,Good level but 45 bubble unnecessary,I had been using this level everyday and it sat in my tool belt. I used it vertically half the time and often found myself flipping it around to read correct bubble. The 45 degree bubble is unnecessary and should be replaced with another vertical scale. The models with one long surface and a single protruded scale are easier to align and use.
4,"Empire 12"" level","Purchased this level from previous advertisements. The blue vial liquids are a very good selling point,as visibility is clear in all positions. Would recommend this product."
4,Everyone missed the point - it's about pitch not level!,"PROS: quality, magnet, string line indentation, vertical slot, durable, looks nice.This is NOT level! It is marked in degrees aka a degreed level for establishing pitch for drainage on a surface, gutter, pipe, concrete, etc. It also can be placed against a string. All the reviews somehow missed this. I never use this ""level"" unless I need to establish pitch.Never use a level to establish a consistent pitch for drainage as it is not made for that and is inconsistent.CONS: get rid of the 45 degree level and replace it with a second vertical. Every time you turn the level to take vertical reading that 1/2 the time you have the wrong end up (45 degree end). Most levels are doing away with the 45 degree end. Who uses the useless 45 degree level to determine a true 45 degree angle? It only gives you a rough 45 and cannot replace the accuracy normally required in 45 degree angles."
3,too small and no scale,"this tool box level is of good quality.recommended for small works such as making small furnitures.but i find it too small for doing a level works for positioning of two hooks for mounting of picture frames,you have to carefully adjust/move it until you reach the other position on same level.also,it would be better if it has scale on it so that you dont have to use a measuring tape anymore."
5,a dank gem,"this may be howard's most drab work with cronenberg,in a beautiful way.too bad it's been oop for so long.it'd be weak to have to rip it off my dvd,but i might end up doing just that if it isn't released on howard's site."
1,Voltaire it's not.,"I was told this was a modern version of Voltaire's Candide. If so, it is a total flop.The best modern version of Candide was Terry Southern's Candy many decades ago."
2,Resident Evil Zero: Pros/Cons,"The music and graphics are great in this game, but there is one MAJOR problem: The controls stink! It is really hard to walk because the direction you need to hold the control stick always changes. Also, what really annoys me his how you can't turn the camera. Aiming the gun is difficult, too. But the graphics and music rule! I have to admit they did a really good job on that. If you're a fan of the seires, you'll like this because it is a prequel and it has a great story. But it didn't really work for me."
4,Great game,"... this games has awsome graphics and effects. Although it uses pre endering backgrounds, the effects are top notch and the sound is indeed a stand out in this series. The control, however, can have a learning curve of anywhere of 5 mins to 30 mins. That is where it looses a star."
5,As good as the first,I didnt rent this game before I bought it. Usually i rent then if i like it I buy it. I bough Resident evil and Resident evil zero a few days ago. When I played this one for the first time it was a great game. I like the two partner system. There are no item boxes in this one but both characters can carry six items which lets you have more items at a time. When theres a better item you see to pick up you can leave some items in a room pick up the other items and go back for the ones you left whenever you want. There are no defense items like the dagger or grenade but if you are being attacked then you get your partner to attack the monster and you wont be hurt. If you liked the first RE than buy this one without renting. Its a fun game.
3,NnyCW for Capcom City,"An interesting twist on the Resident Evil formula in that storage crates no longer exist, you play as two characters whom you can switch between at any moment, and you can now drop things when they become useless. However, it takes a couple steps back from the previously released remake of Resident Evil. No longer do you need to destroy the brain or burn a zombie to destroy it completely and while no storage crates is more realistic, it just creates a lot of needless backtracking to get a certain item you left somewhere. Also, while having two playable characters may sound good in theory, soon enough you'll just play as Billy thanks to his ability to take more punishment and use Rebecca as a sort of pack mule since she can carry more items. Not a bad game by any means, but not as good as the remake of Resident Evil. NnyCW for CapCity"
4,good game,this game must be owned it is better than any x box game ever made. if u own x box jump off your roof with x box on your back x b o x sucks
4,MAGAZINE,"I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THIS A A MAGAZINE NOT A VIDEO GAME.I HAVE THE GAME, AND I AM TRYING TO FIND THE MAGAZINE.IF THIS IS A GAME, PLEASE CANCELL THE ORDER.THANK YOU."
1,"dumb game, but pretty","no item boxes, stupid 2-person partner system that will kill your partner and end the game easy even if you are the mack dad. i bought a gamecube for this??? after alienating us all by giving nintendo the exclusive rights to the best game franchise, this really is the nail in the coffin for capcom and the RE series. the graphics are amazing though. i'm not slagging this of for no reason either, i am the biggest RE fan in the world."
4,Great Prequal,This is a great prequal to an equally great series. I must say that though it was fun it should only be played by the hardcore gamer for it can be rather difficult at times. Four stars overall.
4,GRRRRREAT!,"This is one of my favorite games that I have ever played. It has great graphics. Great graphics also makes it very gruesome. You can shoot zombie's head off and walk in their puddles of blood and see the blood fly everywhere. You can also see your reflection in mirrors. I don't find it all that scary. It is a little bit frustrating at some times because it is unbelievably hard, like all in the series. All in all it is a masterpeice. Woohoo Capcom. Can't wait for Resident Evil 4!"
5,Awesome Prequel,"This is definitely one of my favorite Gamecube games. This is almost as fun as Resident Evil 4! Almost! It's not quite fun enough that you want to replay it immediately, but it's so fun during your first playthrough that you don't want it to end! The controls are hard to get used to after playing RE4, though. I would love to see a remake of this game (and the others) with RE4 gameplay. Definitely worth buying!"
4,Not bad at all.,"Other than having to get used to the tank like controls, and having to backtrack through a few places to fetch items, the game is pretty good. The puzzles and gameplay elements are well thought out and mixed very well, the zombies and monsters are fun to fight against, and the 2D atmosphere with it's bland and dark colors and creepy music, really sets the tone for a fun time moving through the game story and trying to figure out whats going on. Not a bad play through at all."
5,"Getting it, definitely","This is going to be one of the greatest games for the Nintendo Gamecube, ever. The graphics are simply amazing and don't think just because you're on a train for most of the game, you won't have much to do. Far from it. You can be in three different settings. The train, the Mansion (yes, you do go to the mansion in RE0), and the forrest. Plus, this time you don't just play one character through out the entire game. With the C-Stick button you can switch between Rebecca and Billy instantly. Another side note, there aren't Magickal Interlinking Item boxes anymore that you can drop your stuff into. In this new Resident Evil, you can lay your item wherever you want, in any room, anywhere. We get to learn more about what happened to the former S.T.A.R.S team before Chris, Jill, Berry, Wesker, and the gang arrived. We also get to learn more about how Wesker got involved with Umbrella. This game is going to be amazing, and on my top list of games to get."
2,"ok, not as good as the previous REs","i love biohazard/resident evil. unfortunately, capcom changed a few things that were staples of RE: 1) no item boxes. what the heck were they thinking? 2) instead of letting the story put you in control of another character, which was very cool in previous REs, you have to keep track of two characters at all times in this one. big mistake. it was much more frightening when you were off adventuring around in creepy mansions or wherever by yourself, only to run into other people infrequently. solving puzzles/perfoming tasks with two players [stinks]. and you'd better make sure you're in control of rebecca at all times because if you try to run away and there are two zombies around her she is so weak that she will die almost immediately which is... since you as the player didn't do anything wrong. i did give RE0 2 stars though because it is an incredibly gorgeous game."
3,average,"Resident Evil 0 is a good addition to the gamecube lineup, which is mostly either kiddie games or games that are also released on the Xbox. The graphic and sound design are great. However the camera could be better, and I hate the inventory system. I would rather use the chests located at certain locations than having to drop an item that takes up two slots, run back and get it because I need it, and then drop it again because I need the slots for health and ammo, and then run back and pick it up again, the hookshot being one example. It's annoying as hell. There are great moments in the game and some of them will make you jump out of your seat. The boss fights are cool, you'll never look at insects the same way again. The leech zombies suck though. Thank god theres only a few of em."
3,resident evil zero,This game is terrible i would have given it a lower rating but i bought it used for 7 bones. The controls arent like anyother game ive played and its too hard. I started it on normal and had to go back and restart on easy cause i kept running out of save points. The story is ok.
5,For Rebecca Lovers,"I love the setting of the Train in the beginning, and I love how we get to see Rebecca's point of view and her side of the story. I love how you can switch back and forth between Billy and Rebecca and how this is the first resident evil ""co-op""(sort of) of the series. Only thing I didn't like was that Billy and Rebbeca didn't kiss at the end :)"
4,AVOID THIS GAME,"this game is very, very bad. first hting, it is very slow, and very boring. I loved the first one for gamecube. The story was better, and they're zombies. In this game, you'll find a lot more giant bugs and insects than zombies. So, if you grew up watching dawn and day of the dead, and are a person who plays a game for zombies, do not buy this game. They'res giant bugs like a 50 foot high caterpillar, and a 50 foot long scorpion.; I HATE this game. Where in the world would there be a giant caterpillar in a mansion? Final thoughts: Boring, slow, STUPID. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE FIRST ONE, GET EITHER RESIDENT EVIL 22 OR 3 FOR GAMECUBE, or if you dont have the first, get the first. its awesome. RE1 makes this game look like animal crossing."
4,"It's Awesome, and educational","This is a great game, it really makes you think to solve all of the intricate puzzles. It's not just a normal fighting game. Resident Evil 0 is better than all of the others because in this game you can switch between characters at any time (accept once or twice in the begining of the game, but that's not important)! This game is excelent!"
5,This game is o.k.,RE0 is the 2nd best to me it's bad how you can drop stuff and trade charactors. It kind of sucks you cant use a crate in it like in the old Resident evil 0 for N64 pal version you could'nt trade charactors in this old one but the graphits are tight the old one graphits really sucked.In my opinion this one is really tight to the Resident evil remake. But in my opinion Resident evil online for PS2 will be a little better than this. But my favorite Resident evils is Resident evil code veronica x and Resident evil 1.5 demo. What is different to 0 and 1.5 is in RE 1.5 you can get to through grenades and plant C4.
4,resident evil 0,I didn't get this at toy rus but I think it's pretty cool.If your under 17 and are aloud to play m rated games you'll find something to like here later
2,Shameful,"Resident Evil Zero did not live up to its hype. Graphic wise I think its great but gameplay can get boring at times. Some parts meay leave you stuck looking for puzzle answers instead of having some action. If you haven't played any Resident Evil game or Eternal Darkness then I suggest that you play ED first before playing RE0 just so you could appreciate a good game. - Another note, when you don't make use of bullets effieciently the game is pretty much over, while on the other hand in ED you can always use magic, swords, maces ect."
5,Ahead of its time,"All I want to say about Resident Evil Zero, is that it has graphics WAY, WAY ahead of its time! They're so realistic, picture perfect, and they have real lighting effects that makes the jaw drop to the floor. Amazing graphics, great story (A+ for that), and very much scariness (the games so scary, you'll have nightmares), and is so amazing you'll want to yell to the world saying ""this is the most amazing game EVER!"
3,its ok,resident evil zero is just another game in the RE series. there is nothing really new with this game its just so so. it just carries the story along and is hard and boring. the first RE for gamecube which i borrowed from my friend and which ive only played 10 or 15 min of is alot more suspenseful and fun. i cant judge totally since i havent played much of the first RE. but i can say its better than zero. i am at the training facility basement and its hard and stupid. i mean a bunch t virus monkeys start attacking me i mean come on thats not scary thats stupid. i would suggest buying this game if u are a hardcore RE fan but if ur just and average gamer like me who likes the RE series but isnt to crazy about it rent it or just dont play it
5,La de da,I don't know what those people who reviewed this game wrongly are thinking. This game doesn't have storage boxes because it's on a train. it's not like your going to set something down and never be back in that area. it's a freaking train! back and forth is where you go. the prequel to this series has great graphics and its the prequel to the best horror series of games ever. the graphics alone make this game ten times scarier then the games that came out before. it's just great fun that defenitally deserves these five great stars.
2,Mediocre at best,"After playing this game, I was left with the feeling that they are running out of ideas. The fact that you are forced to control two characters is innovative, and at the same time detracts from the Resident Evil experience, because you are no longer alone, which is part of what made previous titles in the series so scary. All around it's just an uncreative game. They attempted to make up for lack of good puzzles by throwing tons of enemies at you, which you of course don't have enough ammo to kill them all, so you're going to take a lot of damage. Rent this one at the most."
3,Item Management,"I am a big fan of the Resident Evil series; however, I felt this game was just not up to par with the others. Overall game was boring and I had no motivation to play. The game became nothing more than item managment. Who can carry this, so I can pick up this, and then combine this so I can have room for this, leave this here, and have Billy pick it up, so I can transfer bullets to him to make room for this. OH yeah, where did I drop that knife?? The whole item system took the fun out of this game."
5,Capcom has done it again!,This is the best of all the RE's. I am a big fan of these games. The ability to switch characters was the best feature of the game. The graphics were astonishing + it scares you like h**l. The monsters are better than ever. Thats right very few zombies and more leaches. I reccomend this game to everyone who is fan of RE.
4,Entertaining,"The book held my interest throughout. Abby is a great character. I did however find many faults in the writing. Many words, while words in themselves were not the correct word for the sentence. Proofreading could have been a lot better. This said I would say, yes read the book, you will enjoy it."
4,Good Entertainment!,"Although this is one of Prescott's older books, I finally read it and I'm not disappointed. Lots of action, suspense and good character development.Abby is a strong character with her own set of rules, almost manic in the novel. Talking incessantly, sarcastic and full of sharp wit. You can clearly visualize her behavior as she works to uncover the truth. Tess, the ever conservative tightass Fed, trying to color in between the lines but constantly drawn out by Abby. The congressman, his aide and the other players round-out an excellent cast with a good conclusion and the set-up for more to come.I've read Prescott's newer novels, which is why I went back to read this one. ""Stealing Faces"" is still my 5-star favorite, but this one is a 4-star to me. Definitely worth reading."
5,"Very fast moving, held me spellbound!",My wife had this book and I picked it up to see what it was about but then I couldn't lay it down. I stayed up half the night to read it and will definatly read more of them. Very good writer!
5,Great read - can't put it down!,"Great ready - really captures my attention and every time I have to pause in my reading, I cannot wait until the next opportunity I get for downtime to continue. Easy to follow, action-grabbing, insightful read. I definitely recommend this book to others who enjoy action and thrillers."
4,Abducted,"Very good story line, from the beginning the story held you in suspense and you were anxious to read on. I would recommend this book.Abducted (Lizzy Gardner Series #1)"
4,Mortal Faults,Another winner by Michael Prescott. His character of Abby Sinclair showed even more personal traits that were nice to meet.
4,"Fun read, unique relationship","Easy and exciting reading, this series features two unique characters (gals). One is a by-the-book FBI agent, the other a psychologist/take-no-prisoners maverick. Their relationship and exploits present moral dilemmas that will keep you guessing whats next. You may even question your more traditional thinking about how to deal with evil in our midst. If your looking for entertainment that gets your brain clicking and your heart pumping, you can't go wrong here."
3,Anyone ever heard of proof-reading?,There are so many typos in this book that I got frustrated reading it. Doesn't Mr. Prescott have any good editors?
3,Engrossing Read But Weak Characters,"I've been a Prescott fan for years now and have read every book. His first few featuring these characters were incredible. This book was attention-grabbing as well, and pulled you through the story quickly but his characters tend to be one-dimensional. The heroines lack any flaws and the antagonist is truly evil, almost over the top. When Abby is suspected of murder in this story, I thought to myself...finally! She's not so perfect; she has a flaw. Imagine my disappointment in the end when it turns out that the true killer was found...and it wasn't Abby. Of course. How could perfect Abby have a flaw? I wish Prescott would let his character have both strengths and weaknesses."
3,"Great series, but...","I love this series, but my issue is with the DVD's themselves. Why are there so many? For a 26 episode 20 min. series there are 8 DVD's on a good box set e.g. Family Guy season one there are seven episodes on one DVD and that show is just as long. Other than that the quality is excellent."
4,A swell comedy,"I remember watching this anime many years ago and enjoying it, i hope to buy this series soon to relive some very missed nostalgia.Out of all the Tenchi stuff floating around id say this one was the most tolerable and possibly best of the bunch. Check this out if you like comedy series and more specifficly Harem anime."
4,Possibly Couldn&#65533;t Get Any Better,"I bought the Kim Possible Gameboy Advance game for my eight-year-old nephew for Christmas. He was excited about the game since he is a big Kim Possible fan. He says that the game was one of his favorite gifts for Christmas. He did get stuck at one point, but got by with some group-up help. Overall, this game looks like a game that he enjoys and will continue to play."
4,This game is great!,"This game is a lot of fun! But it's hard at times. A couple of times I had to look at the book, but I got some of it right away. I have not finished the game yet but I can tell you this it's a lot of fun! I think whoever is reading this should buy this game!!!"
2,boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i got it for13 dollers and its not worth it,bad graphics,bad story,bad and hard controls,and finaly this game is boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!p.s. it s boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Previous individual's review is no longer valid.,The 64 ounce jar has been replaced by the 40-610-06 and has a three year warranty. It works great. I have had my Blendtec Blender in continual use since 2003 and wouldn't change for anything else out there.
4,One of Cassie's Best!,"I recommend Savage Torment to everyone. This was the first book I ever read by Cassie Edwards and it's feelings were so real, so intense I couldn't put it down. Cassie has a true gift. I found that The characters in this book were also in another of her books in the Savage Series. So if you like this book, definately check out therest of them. I can tell you from reading them that they are great!"
1,is this the 1970s?,picked this up...big mistake...very dated and old sounding. Other Brasilians have done the electronic route much better and fresher.
4,Paula takes on the Bebel thing,"Paula Morelenbaum is known for absolutely authentic, traditional takes on bossa classis, particularly Tom Jobim, with whom she and her husband Jaques, performed.But here she is taking on the eletro/ bossacucanova/bebel/eletronica thing with rather strong results. My favorite track by far is the little samba well-known from the Black Orpheus soundtrack, Jobim's O Nosso Amor, which is rarely redone compared to other gems from that film. Here its just giddy with guitar by Luiz Brasil, shortened lyrics, and an almost childlike simplicity from the singer.The other tracks are also a pleasure -- not only because they draw on wonderful, classic compostions but because every arrangement is unique and not much of her husband's cello has been shoehorned into the project (normally his playing is great, but here it's really out of place.)"
5,Recommended,Well-disciplined choir. Nice variety of songs. Clear clean simple childrens' voices. I listen to my CD often.
4,A Broken System,"This documentary is an often times powerful anti-capital punishment message. It is the personal stories of 4 individuals affected by the death penalty. One man was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death, a mother of a murdered daughter, the brother of a man sentenced to death and a former prison warden put in charge of executions. It is a thought-provoking film and it has left this once pro-capital punishment viewer now doubting my stance on the death penalty."
4,Nice..........,"For a person who likes fighting games, this would be a game like Super Smash Bros. Melee. You choose a charcter, play their moves to hurt and kill other people. It's very entertaining.The problem is pretty much, I would have liked it or somehow based it to a resemblance of the Xmen movie...And the graphics, would have to be changed too. Cause it feels like you are fighting pollygons instead of human features...But overall, I got it for Christmas, and it's a good game, it will suprise you...Even if you really don't have the time to rent it, buying it, you will still be impressed.."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"I ordered this book based on the positive reviews, and it was just delivered to me today.As I was breezing cursorily through it, I came to a description of the author's lambs being taken away for slaughter.Guess I was expecting a wonderful book of heart such as ""Enslaved by Ducks"" by Bob Tarte, where he and his wife, Linda, love their pets (at last count, in ""Fowl Weather"", the sequel, being 37 I believe), and deeply mourn when they experience the loss of them due to death.So this book is not for anyone expecting a totally loving tale. I personally could not find ""Peace at Heart"" while raising lambs for slaughter.Anyway, just a warning for those of you whom this might bother or disturb. It is probably very well written, but I personally will spare myself sorrowful feelings by not reading it."
5,Batter Heads,I have been a drummer since 1967. And since that dayte. I have used nothing but Remo heads. They are the best. They were in 1967? as they are in 2010.
3,Not top notch anymore,I've played drums over 30 years now and have tried many brands of drumheads. I've mostly used Remo's up until about 8-9 years ago. After I tried Evans there's no going back. Evans heads are way more consistent and tune up way easier. Plus there's no glue cracking noise (like with Remo). Another thing about Evans is that they don't detune hardly at all. Maybe one pitch lower after putting them on and playing for a while. Evans are slightly more but it's worth it.
1,A poor choice by Gerber,"After having carried a Gerber multitool of one type or another for years, I believed this insert system to be a great idea. I was wrong.I can't even cut a coat hanger without the carbide cutter shattering. I've also tried using the carbides cutter on car stereo wires and it usually leaves multiple strands connected.I'm sincerely disappointed at the implementation of a great idea.I rated it a one because that one star is the great idea. The blank stars are the implementation."
4,great little cutter,"Small replacement cutters are good but crack very easy need to make them a little softer or less carbon in material , can we just buy the cutters without all the screws and wrench each time !!!"
2,"play it for a day or so, then through it into the trash","This game got so much hype. People wrote rave reviews for it without much knowledge about it, let alone playing it. Plane and simple the game is pretty bad. After 15 minutes of watching CARTOON chicks bounce around in bikinis you begin to think of how pathetic your life has become. The volleyball part is cool for about another 15 minutes, so after that you can concentrate on actually beating the game. Which is amazingly short. Overall this game has very little replay value, very little fun, but high on the spank-o-meter... if that is what your life has come to, then for sure, BUY this game."
3,Depends on your definition of a good time.,"This game is completly derrived from sex appeal. If this characters from doa 3, were replaced by girls with clothes on, this game would suffer terribly. But thats not to say its not fun. When you are playing your friends, its very fun,but more of a social aspect, but to just play against the computer, get very old, very fast. Once you get past the girls with the bikinis and large breasts that bounce when they jump, the game instantly dies."
1,Ridiculous.,"As soon as I saw this, I began laughing.I have played and own Dead or Alive 3 (x-box), which, in my opinion is a good game. It's somewhat short, but the graphics (environments, specifically) are great. Now, I'm a woman, thus the ""cute girls"" in this game don't really do anything for me. DOA 3 is good, but this is completely ridiculous.The calendar that goes along with the game is also utterly ridiculous. But funny.You guys need to get a girlfriend."
2,Does not work on XBOX360,"If you buying this game hoping to play it on an XBox360, don't bother. It will not play and there is no update to make it play. I can't really rate it because of this problem."
3,Fun for a little while.,"This game is alright, but my biggest complaint is that this is a 2 player game instead of 4. The volleyball section itself is fun for a little bit, but really needs to be played with other people because playing by yourself gets kinda old.Besides that, there's also a casino to go play. The games are Poker, Blackjack, Roullette, and some slot machines. And me being a fan of those type of games (2 more years until I'm 21! Look out Vegas!) this is where I myself have the most fun. But sadly, this feature is not multiplayer! *shakes fist at Tecmo*The rest of the game is just a kind of friendship simulator where you must give gifts to the girls in order for them to like you and receive other gifts they might not normally want to keep. You make money from winning volleyball games, and winning from the casino. You'll spend most of your time just buying and collecting items, and just staring at the girls doing their thing.If anything, this game is at least worth being a rental."
4,Maybe guys really secretly want to play with Barbie Dolls,"Besides the game's major sex appeal which really accounts to many people buying and defending this game, this is really not a bad little game. I really enjoyed all the options with all the extra games (casino!) and its massive collection of items. The gameplay is simple and fun at the same time and who could argue with the lush settings and beautiful graphics. Which is always expected out of Team Ninja and Tecmo. Being a huge DOA fan, I couldn't pass this up, and to say the least I really enjoyed playing it. The only argument that I have with the game is the void of 4 player action...maybe in DOA Xtreme Vollyball 2."
5,"STILL GREAT, STILL SEXY 9.5 OUT OF 10","Though people who think I hate good clean fun are wrong, they're not totally wrong. This is one of those controversial games that parents absolutely despise, and that's one of the reasons I love this game. The graphics are still damn good, even after its release four years ago, the volleyball gameplay is still solid, the breast physics are still very noticeable(although not as noticeable as they are in DOAX 2 for Xbox 360), it's still a lot of fun to gamble(I love blackjack), and it's still fun to shop, recruit partners, do pool hop, relax, watch videos, get sent gifts, and it still has an excellent soundtrack to go along with its beach themes. If you own DOAX 2 for the 360, and you have never played this game, you'll love it. Oh, and people who hate me for my review of The Bible Game; SHOVE IT! I'll continue to enjoy my inappropriate games that are violent and sexual."
3,Don't expect too much!,"If you are a volleyball fan or are looking for a game based on the sport itself, look elsewhere. This game is about fun, but most of it is not related to volleyball.The basis of the game is to make lots of friends and collect all kinds of gifts that they give you. There are bathing suits, sunglasses, hats, guns, and whacky other accesories to choose from. If you love the DOA girls, you'll love being able to switch the camera views while they pose wearing whatever bathing suit you want.The game was rated an M for nudity by the ESRB, but there really isn't any full nudity. (Partial nudity everywhere though)"
3,girls,"i wanted to play with the girls u know make them bounce there boobs,and not take to avoid me, i don't want to play there games."
5,Don't listen to the reviewer who says there's nudity........,"The code that EGM listed in its magazine is intended as an April Fool's joke. I guess this guy was too stupid to fall for it. However, the game is still a lot of fun without the nudity, and I highly recommend it."
3,Mediocre game. Great gag gift.,"As a present, will put a confused look on anyone's face. Although, it turns out my friend actually liked playing it. Goofball."
1,Pour adolescent boutonneux,Ce jeux est fait pour un adolescent qui n'a jamais vu une fille dans un playboy. Le seul interet est de voir les personnages féminin en maillot de bain. Le gameplay est nul et les fonction limité... A place d'acheter ce jeux la... Aller donc prendre le Extreme Outlaws volleyball qui est beaucoup plus complet.
2,As if XBox couldn't get worse...,"I'm about to commit an act of treason against men everywhere. I'm about to give DOA:EBV a negative rating. But I honestly need to. This game, as advertised, only serves as eye-candy for perverts and a waste of money for gamers everywhere (much like the XBox system itself). Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely some good things about this game. The disc makes a nice frisbee and I'm sure there are some great posters out there, but beyond that, it does little in the way of providing a good gaming experience. But then again, so little of the XBox games do, anyway. I suppose ""Panzer Dragoon Orta"" will probably be their one and only breakthrough, but beyond that, they have little to offer and will thus go the way of the Sega Dreamcast. There is one truly great thing about the XBox, though: it makes a truly excellent doorstop. Happy playing!"
2,Huge Disappointment,"This game is only marginally entertaining for about 2 hours. The volleyball ""gameplay"" is only two buttons. The casino is incredibly boring. The graphics are nice, but so what? How long can you look at cartoons in bikinis? The HUGEST, most GLARING failure of this game is that there are NO character endings, i.e., there is no goal to achieve in this game. You don't even have any real incentive to play volleyball at all, except to break up the monotony a little bit. I can't believe this game was actually made and marketed. Mine's going back to Best Buy immediately."
5,I love this game!,"My husband got this game as just a silly present. I, however, can't get enough! I try to stay away from any video games because they've gotten so complicated, so I loved being able to learn this game very quickly. I LOVE the shopping! Although this game seems a bit promiscuous, any girl who likes the mall will love this game! Give them an hour...you won't be able to get her off of the Xbox."
4,"Volleyabll w/ DOA Girls, What could be better","Unlike some of these reviews (reviewers), I acutally own this game and I had pre-ordered it since the first time I had heard about it. My final opinion after playing this was... stunning. This game is amazing. Beside the lush visuals there is also an amazing amount of gameplay while playing volleyball. The volleyball games are exciting, fun, and breathless. The psyhics engine that runs this game is remarkable, when the girls dive for the volleyball in a match - sand flies up in the air and every part of the girl's body corresponds w/ hitting the ground. The feeling and visuals of this game, make it feel as if it were real-life. The music, I felt, was lacking in this game, but what makes up for this small flaw is the allowence of custom soundtracks. If you don't already own this game, I suggest you buy because it is truly a fabulous piece of work. Nothing graphically ever in any video-game matches up to it."
2,Beautiful... but the gameplay!,"Without a doubt, this is a very beautiful game. Great graphics.However, what I really expected from this game was not just spectacular (and sexy) graphics, but a killer game engine that would overshadow other Beach Volleyball games (on any system), just like Dead or Alive 3 had excellent gameplay for a fighting game (and spectacular graphics). Unfortunately, this is not the case. The gameplay comes down to pretty much push one of two buttons. Even the camera isn't up to the task. More than once did I have to dive for the ball off screen...If you are a fan of the characters: Get the game. If you just want to look at half-naked girls: Buy a magazine or look at the screen shots here. If you want to play good volleyball: Look somewhere else..."
2,GRAPHICS IS ABOUT ALL YOU GET,"Yes, this game looks amazing the, jiggling of the girls and the graphics are amazing if your into staring at computer generated versions. Everything in this game after the graphics was very dissapointing. The name of this game shoudl have been Dead or Alive dress-up. It appears the only goal in this game was to dress up you or your partner and the volleyball is just a mini-game to acheive that goal. Volleyball.. not fun. For a franchise that has multiple combo hits and kicks as well as reversals this game is extremely simple, I expected more. Also the camera angles didn't help. For some reason it doesn't give you a complete view of the court. Meaning there were times I had no idea where my character was. There is so much more that dissapointed.. rent this game first and see for yourself if you must"
3,"Not ""Mature""","If you are looking for an ""Adult"" game - this is not it. This is no BMX XXX. There is no nudity ! There is no strip volleyball. There are just a bunch of chics in bikinis playing volleyball. I like that. But this is not worth the ""M"" rating. GTA: Vice City, a game where you can pay for sex and murder people indiscriminately and one of your ultimate goals is to buy the local stip club, is worth the ""M"" rating. BMX XXX where there is bona fide nudity and REAL hidden codes that offer more is worth the ""M"" rating. This game is a light, fluffy, feel good game that you and your girl friend will enjoy playing together. Girls like to shop and much of this game revolves around shoping and gamboling. Once my girl friend got over the discomfort of my watching cartoon babes in skimpy outfits she took over shopping for them and gamboling. The only reason I was still around was to play the volleyball part.Anyway, do not be DECIEVED. This game should be rated ""E"" for everyone !!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,This came is entertaining for about ten min. There is not story or plot and most of the dialog is in another language. The only thing that is in english is the text. This game is nothing more than barbies plaing vollyball on the beach.
5,The Code!,Their is a code out there and lets just say you see their whole body! Good luck on finding it!
2,Boring and Horrible Sound,I was incredibly disappointed with this game after some of the rave reviews it received. I think either people were totally into the mostly naked women or they haven't played many games before because the game itself is lame.
2,Should be tossed in the ocean,"Graphics are great, the girls look good. I have no clue why this is rated ""mature?"" - All the hype surrounding this game was a farce in my opinion. I have not seen any of these girls have a nipple-slip at all! Gameplay is horrible and frustrating. I liked BMX-XXX better! At least you can have a character with bulls-eyes painted on her breasteses!"
1,"Wow. so, so horrible","I am a guy that very much appreciates the female form. However, this was perhaps the worst thing I have ever played. Basically, I started jumping on little pads in the game to earn money. Once I did that for 10 minutes, I went to the casino. I bet all my money and ended up winning it all back, and then some. I went to the store, bought the thong thingy, and that was it. I accomplished what the game basically was asking. i beat it in approximately 15 minutes. I tried playing vollyboll. horrible. All in all, this game, even with a bunch of friends cracking up every time we heard the words, ""niceU spikeARU"" was a abomination. I would rather have been expending my oxygen elsewhere. So, so, so, horrible."
1,Gameplay sucks and the girls rock,"The only good part of this game is the great graphics. The camera angle and controllers sucks so bad that it is really difficult to play. I thought this was a 4 player game. It turns out that it is 2 player game and you control 2 girls at the same time with each analog thumb thingy. The camera angle only shows 2 to 3 girls at a time so you can hardly play and it scrolls to the other side of the net with the ball. If you need to see hot half naked girls you'll find it here but they are also fake, so go find a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition instead."
3,THIS GAME DOES HAVE NUDITY,in this game you can unlock a TOPLESS MODE in which all the girls run around TOPLESS that means No Top[Everything] showingi figured people should be informed about thisand if you dont believe me pick up a issue ofElectronic Gaming Monthly(the one with link on the cover)
1,Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball,i would have bought this game what the hell up with the big giggle [...]? i am a girl i dont wont to look at that the dude who made this is a perv!
1,Poor beach vball game,"If your looking for a good beach vball game, go elsewhere. This game is not about vball at all. Game play is horrible. The only good thing about this game are the animations. Your better off picking up an old school nintendo and Super Spike Volley Ball."
4,No Nudity,the rating of Nudity is a Lie. It's just a trick to get men/boys to buy this title. Suggestive poses is not nudity.
4,Good Game...,"This is a pretty good game, but I must first point out that it isn't for kids. There are bouncing breats and girls in bikinis. That is why it isn't for under 14 at least. The overall mechanics of this game is simple. You don't really get to play much volleyball, but you do get a lot of options. From winning games and other things, you get cash. With that cash, you can buy other swim suits, sun tan lotion, and other accesories. It really doesn't help when you tell a girl to put on the lotion, you just see the bottle empty. Overall, this game is just plain fun to play."
4,Fun Game...,"I think this is an incredibly accurate simulation of a volleyball game. Admittedly, I have yet to play other volleyball video games, but I definitely enjoy the gameplay in this one. Some people will complain that only two buttons are used, A and B. But, I don't mind this too much. It's definitely an easy game to play and pick up, but will require practice before you become really good. The graphics are simply amazing. Overall, this game's greatest strength is it's mindless-fun component. It's the type of game that you can just relax with and unwind to after playing more hardcore action titles such as Halo or Unreal Championship on Xbox Live, which I highly recommend."
5,A Slapper,"this is the best cd in the 3 part series. every track make you wanna get stupid. the production is hella tight. everyone need to scoop this one up, yaddaimean. thizz in peace MD!"
2,Impossible,The previous reviewer was being kind. The first half of the tapes were fine for English only viewers but the 2nd half was completely and I mean completely unintelligible. They changed caption writers and the 2nd one had absolutely no idea about English. The Chinese sub-titles were good throughout though. Do NOT buy if you only speak English you will be completely devastated that you could not follow what was obviously a wonderful series. The producers of the discs should be ashamed.
2,Outstanding Program if you speak korean fluently,"The Jewel in the Palace is a Korean drama based on the life of a young woman who became a Physician to the King, a remarkable feat for women of the era. It is beautifully acted, the costumes and filming is superb.Unfortunately this particular edition is let down by poor subtitles. In the 1-6 discs the subtitles are understandable with some concentration but in discs 7 - 9 the English subtitling is completely unintelligable. An example of this:""Is, say that is have problems inside the person who the food poisoning. Elephant words too not till the vegetableses that now ate have never type of matter"" (transcribed directly)If you speak Korean Fluently then this single DVD set is a bargain, costing substantially less than the three separate DVD sets of Jewel in the Palace which are available. However if you rely on English subtitles then this DVD set will not meet your expectations."
2,Like a Rock,"This pillow is not as advertised. It is supposed to me made of viscoelastic memory foam. However, it seems more like regular foam. The pillow is much firmer than similar models that I have tested. I do not reccomend this product."
4,Great for sleeping on your side,Great for sleeping on my side. A little too high and stiff for sleeping on my back. Overall pleased for what I paid for it.
1,Not original,"These poems sound like poorly crafted journal entries. The poem Rapture is a terribly conceived (and awkwardly written) direct ""steal"" from an old Buddhist story."
3,Best of the diaries series,"Of the four decade-each Diaries/Notebooks volumes, beginning with The Twenties, I find this one the best. Edited by Leon Edel, Wilson is less rambling here, his thoughts more concentrated. Many sections are headed Talcottville, Wilson's inherited house in Lewis County, NY. Major interests for Wilson at this time were the Dead Sea Scrolls and the plight of the Iroquois Indians in Upstate New York. None of the Diaries/Notebooks volumes comes close to the best of Wilson's work, which remains the literature/book reviews."
4,Fun Game!,"When you play the regular board game , it takes forever.This game, depending on how you play moves WAY quicker. Easy to maneuver and you play on various boards, pieces and rules.The trading screen may be a little difficult for some but once you get the hang of it, its smooth sailing. Would definitely recommend this game"
4,More math please!,"This really is an excellent introduction to microeconomics, but its weakness is that it tries to be all things to all people. The author appears to be trying very hard not to scare away potential readers who might be intimidated by calculus. This is a shame, since the level required is not very difficult. All that is really needed is a quick review of the derivitative, and the chain rule in particular. Calculus is essential for any further study of economics, so relegating it to the back of chapters does not do students any service. Having said all that, the concepts are very clearly and thoroughly expained. I just wish the math were more 'up front.'"
3,could be better,"This book is used everywhere by everybody. It is the most popular undergraduate text on the continent. I, however, was disappointed when I first looked into it. I found the book to be very sketchy. The way I see it, Varian had some lecture notes that he thought he would slap together and make a textbook out of. He doesn't appear to have put much more work into it than that. What is the purpose of those pathetic chapter summaries and the end of chapter questions, and, last but not least, the deplorable mathematical appendices? I also found Varian's occasional attempts at humor to be misplaced.Varian's text is good for some things (no textbook is ALL bad). Chapter 10 on intertemporal choice, for instance, or chapter 12 on uncertainty are both covered with clarity. <"
2,terrible economics book,"As many others have noted it contains very few numerical examples. I didnt have the workbook so maybe that would have helped, but so far this book is completely useless. I wouldnt recommend this unless you really love the pure formulas an no examples. If its required i guess its better than nothing"
4,Mesmerizing story,"A truly mesmerizing and gripping story, based on true events. Along with the main character, you will be wondering who to trust."
5,The Deceivers,This film describes in detail the Indian Thugee cult and how one British officer fought to destroy it. The cast are very good and the locations are excellent.
3,Visiting a painful past,"Growing up in the northern midwest, I rarely saw any African-Americans and although I'd seen many of these pictures elsewhere, like the child I was, I keep wondering how anyone could justify the inequality of treatment."
2,"""Photogenic but Lacks Dramatic Intensity""","Produced and marketed as a ""tragedy"", this subtitled film has essentially two parts--neither of which is cinematically noteworthy. The first portion, for example, deals with the protagonist's family and work life--the mounting financial stressors predominate. The second segment deals with the family's attempts to cope with a major loss. The characters, children and physical landscape are certainly photogenic, but as a dramatic portrait there's really no intensity or compelling urgency for one to rush out and purchase this film."
5,Doughmaker pans are the best,"The doughmaker series of pans are my all-time favorite baking pans and are fantastic for pretty much any baking task. The pans are a light color and have a pebble texture that work together to make for even cooking and reduced sticking. I like to make my cookies extra crispy, no soft doughy parts at all. With these pans I can reliably cook the cookies for significantly longer without burning the edges or bottoms and get that great crispy cookie texture.Only down side is that they do not fair well if you wash them in the dishwasher. The dishwasher deteriorates the surface causing food to stick and the finish to look tarnished."
5,LOVE THESE PANS,"i have several of these cookie sheets. and i love them! they are great for baking anything. when using for cookies, i always use parchment paper. but for other things such as pizzas, french fries, etc. i don't even grease them. nothing has really stuck. they are not a lgith weight cheap pan. so the metal heats nicely and evenly. I will only buy and recommend these baking sheets!"
2,Not Non Stick,"I bought these way over priced cookie sheets based on the wonderful reviews. I wanted a big cookie sheet and that is the only thing I like about these pans. My cookies stick to them, my croissants stick to them (and you can't have more butter than that), and they have no ""lip"" to catch any liquid that might run off. When I tried to gently scrub off the stuck on mess they appeared to scratch as well. I can't let them soak as they don't fit in my sink. I now use cooking spray with everything even when it says do not grease and I am glad I did not discard my old, seasoned, real non stick pans. I will have to keep looking for a good non stick cookie sheet that is of the same dimensions."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This cookie sheet doesn't live up to anything that the creators claim. But the worst part is that the cobblestone finish, which supposedly does great things for you, is impossible to clean! If anything seeps in between the ridges, you will never be able to remove it. I am very disappointed with the product. Try air-bake cookie sheets instead."
1,Boooo!,If I could give this product no stars I would. I used it on some cookware and had no results. It was like cleaning with white water.
4,"Buy This Set, But Not First","This is an okay set. It is nowhere near as good as some of the premium sets or even some of the other basic sets, but I would buy it again.Of the commonly available sets I would recommend getting the kitchen first, then the nursery, then the dining room, then the bathroom, then this set.For a basic set it has lots of accessories. The chair set folds out in to what I assume is a recliner or sleepover chair, the tethered blanket on the bed is fun, and the pillow is nice. I'm not sure I understand why they put a food tray with this set. I think a dress up table with mirror or something else girly instead of the nightstand and food tray would be more fun.Like many of the other sets, they really should update the colors and fabrics to make it more modern."
3,"Sizes A Bit Off, But Daughter Likes It","My daughter received a Loving Family dollhouse as a hand me down, and this set doesn't fit properly in any of the upper floor rooms. The house she has is the one that has a horse/ stable theme. The canopy on the bed sticks up too high for the upper lip on the roof of the house, so you can't push it back to the wall. Also, the chair that's supposed to pull out to a bed isn't long enough for the child dolls that go with the dollhouse. These things don't bother my daughter, who is 3, at this point. She loves to cover up her dolls in the bed with the blanket for hide and seek or tuck them in and still uses the chair unfolded for dolls to sit on. However, when she's older and more interested in setting up the house in specific rooms I think this will be frustrating."
4,bedroom for playhouse,"This stimulates imagination in two year old while playing with doll house. Fun to watch her ""set it up"" in different places and in different ways. Puppies sleep on the bed alot!"
2,I expected better from Fisher Price,"For what you are getting it is not up to Fisher Prices' quality or for the cost. This item is not as bad of price as compared to most of the other sets they sell.It is not very real looking. Most children's bedrooms do not look like this. They have a bed, dresser maybe a night stand and lots of toys & maybe a pet."
1,disappointment,I ordered this Loving Family Kid's Bedroom set as a Christmas present for my Niece. They shipped a different room set and now my Niece has to exchange it. Very disappointed that the item ordered was not the item shipped to my Niece!
3,Looks pretty good,"This game looks like it will be a worthy counter-part to the one for PC. You will have a large array of weapons, items, levels, & characters. The reason why I'm giving it only 3 stars is because one of the best features of the PC version is the ability to play multiplayer via the internet with other gamers such as yourself. Overall though, it looks good!"
4,larry,I have played this for the computer. If this one is as good and has all of the levels as the computer then this game is just right for you gamers out there.
2,If you don't like first person games don't even bother.,"I recently borrowed this game from a friend. While I don't like first person games I'd heard that a little ways in it became mainly third person and had some awesome battles. I thought ""Okay I'll suffer the first few levels and then be treated to some great action."". Well I was wrong, I was tortured the first few levels and then only somewhat amused when the switch happened. I hardly even play 1st person games and can tell a good one from a bad one and this is bad. Also the controls in both perspectives use the control stick and the D-pad heavely. How on earth can I use both at the same time!!! This ones for Star Wars fans and FPS lovers only. Despite some cool battles in 3rd person it just wasn't that fun."
4,sucks,The best game of the centruy it sucks best game m m mm m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m mm m m mm m m m m m mm m mm m m m m m m m m mm m m m m m m m m m
1,This game sucks,"This games graphics suck, and the multiplayer and single player suck. everything sucks about this game including that you can't do anything cool, which sucks. I also think that the game sucks because of the fact that it sucks and also my little brother is better at it than I am. Also, another thing that sucks, is that my little sister killed me in the multiplayer mode. I mean, really, she's only two! One more thing, the lightsaber just plain sucks. I don't know what all you people are talking about. Is it supposed to do anything cool or anything? It doesn't. It sucks."
4,A Jedi Review,"This game is as great as the Force! You can meet legendary characters like Luke Skywalker. Travel from planets such as Yavin to Bespin. Rip through flesh(literally) with disruptor rifle, blow away enemeys with missile lanchers, or hunt Sith wiht your powerful lightsaber.Wield the power of the Force with Force speed, Force grip, and Force lighting.Not good grahics but it has great multi-player."
4,May The Force Be With You,This game is SO COOL. This game takes place 8 years after the Empire's defeat on Endor. Now the old Empire is called the Remanent and the leader is Admeral Fyarr. And the dark jedi Dessan. The game is about a failed jedi named Kyle Katarn and his female partner Jan Ors. He was once a imperial. He led an invasion on a rebel outpost and didn't have the heart to kill Jan. Now he and Jan are mercanaries for the New Republic. They where on an assignment on Kejim when they discovered crystals that could give the power of the force to living things. A group of New Republic Colonists where captured on Artus Prime and are prisoners to the Remanent. They are mining these crystals for the Remanent so Dessan can invade the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. And destoy the jedi forever. And if Dessan wins Admersl Fyarr becomes the new Emperor. So it is up to Kyle and Jan to save the New Republic. BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!
5,Way Cool,"I have no idea how but I managed to score a brand new copy for the GameCube for only 40 buck! And I will never sell my copy it rock so hard, the single player mode can be incredibly hard if you dont know what you are doing. But the multiplayer is insanely fun. and with this game becomeing harder to find every day I consider myself quite lucky. Here is a tip that I found quite usfull when hunting for this game. Go to gamestop, funcoland, gamecrazy, or EB games as early as possible on tuesdays. Because on tuesdays they put out all of the used games that they have collected over the week. I found that 100 percent of the stores I went to had a used copy of this game. So its really not that hard to find if you know were and when to look."
5,BEST STAR WARS GAME ON GAMECUBE,"IM 15 BUT THE KIDS REVIEW IS ALOT EASYER. THIS GAME IS GREAT.THE MULTIPLAYER MODE IN THIS GAME IS INSANE AND FUN. THIS GAME IS REALLY HARD TO FIND THOUGH. I CAN ONLY RENT THIS GAME BECAUSE I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE. BUT ANYWAY, THE WEAPONS IN THIS 1ST PERSON SHOOTER GAME ARE GREAT. THE STORY LINE IS VERY INTERESTING AS WELL. THIS GAME TAKES PLACE SEVERAL YEARS AFTER RETURN OF THE JEDI AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW LUKE SKYWALKER IS NOW A JEDI MASTER AND SUCH. THE CHARACTER YOU PLAY AS IS NAMED KYLE AND AT THE START OF THE GAME YOU ARE STILL A PADAWAN ( BEGINNER JEDI ) AND YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITH THE FORCE OR A LIGHTSABER YET ... BUT SOON IN THE GAME WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO BECOME A JEDI, THE GAME GETS ALOT MORE FUN. ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR JEDI ABILITIES YOUR WEAPON IS YOUR LIGHTSABER AND IT TURNS INTO 3RD PERSON MODE. YOU CAN ALSO DO INSANE JUMPS LIKE A REAL JEDI AS WELL. WELL ENOUGH OF MY YAPPIN .. GET THE GAME ALREADY!!!"
2,"Runs hot, warranty replacement was fast","This unit runs VERY hot, almost too hot to touch. After a few ports went out I called for a warranty replacement and received one that still runs hot. I expect I will have to call about this again in the future.As prices fall this one may not be worth the cash."
1,Two died within a year for me also,"I just had my second one of these die within a year and was surprised to see that another reviewer had exactly the same problem. They definitely do run hot, and they definitely die much too soon!"
2,To Hot to Touch,I had 2 of the SD216 LINKSYS switches. Both sat on their rubber feet. One was in a network with a few other switches. But the one that failed today was the only switch in the network. Both had the Linksys to Cisco Trade Up Program sticker on them. They lasted for about 2 years and then bang they went into a funk. The switch would work for a few seconds and then all the lights would flash and all connections were lost.
5,Greatest Guitar Player,This book was purchased for my boyfriend who is a huge EVH fan! Eddie is the greatest guitar player in our opinion and my boyfriend mimics him well. EVH doesn't get the credit he deserves for the music that he has created over the years; this book is well put together and I'm sure I will purchase more.Thanks
2,Not Impressed...,"All show and no go. I could pick up an issue of Guitar One with Eddie on the cover and find more insight into the man and his music than is offered here. I like the fact that a spiral binding was offered so one could place it on a music stand, but so very little of his HUGE pantheon of music was offered here that I would be in error to tell you to purchase it."
1,Very disappointing,"I got good news and bad news. First, the bad news. This book is terrible. It's 106 pages, half of which contain pics. So you're looking at only about 50 pages of text. Oh, and the text itself is terrible. A virtual plethora of mistakes. Very embarrasing.The good news? I just saved a buncha money on my car insurance by switching to Geico!Jokes aside, steer clear of this one. If you want a quality VH book, check out the recently released ""Van Halen 101."" That book is the genuine article."
1,Horrible Book!,"Malcolm Dome is an idiot! It's sad that classic VH went right over this rock journalist's head. He couldn't even comprehend Van Hagar either. He seems very bitter VH did not tour Europe so he spews his venom here. Kiss Van Halen's American ass! This book is filled with inaccuracies, mispellings, and grammatical errors. Too many to mention. He's a professional journalist? It seems the only recording he understood was Van Halen's debut. Stay clear of this garbage and get Van Halen 101 written by a fan who knows what he is talking about. Abel Sanchez is a huge fan, but can still write objectively and has done his homework. ""Van Halen is America's Led Zeppelin!"""
3,good,"The copy I got of this on LP for a dollar out of a bin has a buxom blond on the cover, who I thought was Carmen Cavallaro, female vocalist. I didn't realize Cavallaro was the guy on piano. What do you expect from a rock and free jazz guy.I really can't judge this music, as I am completely novice at forties and fifties lounge. I will say, though, that Cavallaro has quicksilver fingers and a distinctive touch on the keys, and while I don't typically listen to this genre, I did enjoy Carmen, or at least his dancing fingers.It's unlikely I'll play this again soon but it was worth the spin I took it for."
3,Chesteron: great! Gardner's annotations: mostly worthless.,"Chesterton's novel, of course, is wonderful and entertaining and thought-provoking. But I bought this edition because I wanted Gardner's annotations to lend insight and interest. Mostly, the annotations describe London geography even where it has very little bearing on the meaning of the novel, or provide definitions of French phrases. Some annotaions are almost insulting in their obviousness, and some give away plot points before they occur in the text.Gardners introduction and afterword are more to my liking, assisting with interpreting the final meaning of the novel. It would have been more helpful if the annotations also assisted in this task, by, say, poiting out stylistic and narrative choices Chesterton was making to convey his meaning along the way. A ""commentary"" of sorts."
3,Gardner and Chesterton don't mix,"Gardner had a similar problem with his ANNOTATED INNOCENCE OF FATHER BROWN: he avoided footnoting things which might be confusing, or for which he could have provided fascinating notes, in favor of stating obvious points. Why does this magnificent annotator do such a mediocre job with Chesterton, whose obscurities would benefit so much from the Full Gardner Treatment (see THE ANNOTATED ALICE)?"
2,bad if want to use headphones,"at first i was very satisfied with the product, it did what it's suppose to which is protect my phone. it works fine if the only thing you plug into the side is the charger but if you try and use the adapter to plug in headphones you have to take off the case! and after taking it on and off a few times the sides starting cracking so it's not meant to take on and off. if you don't plan on using headphones then it's a good product but if you do then i wouldn't get it."
1,"Unit good when it works, problem is it doesn't always work.","I purchased this unit in Dec 2003. Scanned a few slides, then came back to in a month later. The unit would not load or unload slides. It made all sorts of grinding noises. Minolta fixed it under warranty. When they shipped it back, it had a damaged face plate. I stupidly did not bother to call them back and demand it to be fixed again. I did not care about minor cosmetic damage to the face plate. I subsequently scanned over 500 slides with it with good results. I did not use if for several months, and now the unit is dead. Won't load or eject the film holder. Now Minotla claims it is damaged and not under warranty. Before you buy this unit, look for others will similar repair problems. I wish I did before I bought this scanner. Not recommened do to the poor workmanship and faulty design that requires frequent trips to the repair shop."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product and one of the easiest Scanners I've ever used! I'm sure there are better ones out there, but this is a great choice if you are just beginning."
1,worked great when it worked,"I was greatly dissapointed in this scanner. The software was very problematic on my Mac G4 OSX.4 platform. User groups had solutions but were cumbersome and rediculous to do. The hardware constantly crashed and finally never started. Minolta suggested it needed repair, right out of the box, that it was a hardware problem!!Good luck.Dissapointed"
3,"Probably the 2nd best 35mm film scanner, when it works.","The best would be the 5400-II...This is my second Minolta 5400 scanner. The first one failed not even three months after purchase. It was exchanged after countless (international long distance) calls to Minolta USA. In all I was without a film scanner for over four months. The first unit refused to eject the film holder, no matter what. It seems a common ailment for this model, as I much later found out.My present unit did the same a few months ago, long after the warranty had expired. I came to find good advice in (...) that permitted me to repair the unit --actually it was a film holder problem.I wouldn't recommend this scanner to any one who is not very technically and mechanically oriented.On the bright side, you won't find a better 35mm film scanner regardless of cost. It beats the finest enlarger fitted with the best lens. If you are still shooting film and can live with the quirks, by all means get one."
2,Leaves much to be desired!,"Where are the footnotes? There's a bibliography but where did he get the information for his most 'profound' statements? This is an interesting story but when an author claims to know the intentions of people 2000 years ago he needs to clearly state his sources. Whoever claims that this book seals the deal for them is a person who read this book 'wanting' the 'answers' in this book.I read this book with an open mind and finished with pages of questions that were raised and not answered. Now I'm rereading it and trying to find and read the books in the bibliography and find out who the authors are and what their agenda was. Everyone has an agenda.This book is may be a starting point for the quest for truth but should not be an ending point. For a book that is supposed to be so critical to our people, the time should have been taken to carefully document everything."
3,Introduces some great info but POORLY written,The book is poorly written but does offer some great historical information. I imagine there may be a book that is better written and less biased. But I don't regret buying and reading it.
4,This is a pretty good album,A bit of old school rap mixed with a fast up to date beat. I would definetely recommend it to anyone who listens to hip hop or rap.
3,This title will end up in a dusty box after the brief fun.,"I was really getting an itch to play this game after seeing it in a magazine article. Being a big fan of the old contra games, I tried to find it for rent before I made a purchase. Unfortunately, no place had it available so I bought it on Amazon.com for a modest price(less than most retail). It was fun, but and very chalenging. The graphics, sound, everything were good. The only thing that was missing was the need to play it again. I wish I would have rented this. After a week you will be sorry you didnt purchase something else that will stay in your playstation longer."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"It has a co-op mode, but neither of us were that into it. We played it for a little while, but just gave up."
2,"Is the new Contra no fun, or did I just grow up?","I was addicted to Contra as a kid. On the old NES, there was hardly a better game, and I spend hundreds of hours on each one, fighting, shooting, blowing stuff up. I was so excited for this one I could hardly stand it, and I didn't care if it was 2-D. In fact, I WANTED the game to be exactly the same as the old ones. I bought the game, put it in, and started to play.Then I got bored. Fast. I couldn't believe it. I played for about 20 minutes and couldn't take it anymore. I shot some stuff, but it just wasn't fun. One of two things happened. Either this game is horrible compared to the old games, or I just plain grew out of Contra. I hope it's the former.This game is hard, but in a frustrating way. I don't recommend buying this game--rent it once and you will be sick of it before it's due back, even if you're a die-hard Contra fan."
3,bout a fun as real war,its called contra and it plays like contra but the insane difficulty turns most away im talking 1 hit and u die 3 lives total no continues no secret codes even the game designers themselves call this the hardest game alltime and i tend to agree it borders on unplayable if u think running 5 feet then getting shreded by machinegun fire is fun buy this but be warned im not exagerating youll maybe get 5 feet before getting mutilated like your wearing neon camoflouge that says not american guy stay away from this terd i dont think mr myagi could beat 1 stage of this game
3,Nice but...,"It's a fun game but one thing i don't like is there is no save point and when the character dies, you have to re-do all the tasks one more time... This game isn't that easy. If you have the time to re-do and re-do the same task again and again till you beat it to the next level then you'll be fine with this game. Overall, not a bad game. Just frustrated from time to time(for me), that's all :) Have fun!"
4,Almost too hard to be fun.,"Ok everyone knows how hard this game is. ITS HARD OK??? Besides that, the game design and graphics are amazing. I really wish they would make the new castlevania games in the same style."
4,The classic is back,"The original contra games were cool and are still are today. However, does this game stand up to what it use to be. The answer is yes. It may be on a differant platform but the gameplay has returned and is better than ever.The game starts of with four levels you can choose from. Now this sounds like it is short but far from it. Yes the levels are slightly short but it will take you time and time again to even get close to the end of the levels.The difficulty is rather high but any gamer should find the patterns of enemies and bosses after a few turns. Since the difficulty is a little high younger gamers should perhaps stay away from this one or just rent it.Even though the gameplay is in 2D, the enviroments and characters are themselves 3D.If you enjoy games which bring back the past then you should pick up a copy of Contra:Shattered Soldier"
1,Laughable,"As a previous reviewer said ""GARBAGE"" This game lacks everything but most of all originality. ZERO stars!"
1,This game is so BAD,"This game was one of the worst I've ever played. The graphics are decent, but they just can't match the old Contra from the NES. The day that they realize this, and stop making stupid games like this one, the better."
1,Not worth your serious consideration,I have to agree with most of the other reviewers that this book shows all the signs of being hastily put together with absolutely no proofing or quality control. The concepts are poorly organized and the writing appears to have been translated from some other language. Worst of all are the many typos and missing parts. If you already know a bit about writing and deploying EJBs you will be able to hack most of the examples to work but I guarantee you will come away annoyed and frustrated. Look elsewhere to invest your training money.
2,Examples don't work,"I was very disappointed with the quality control and scope of this book. It basically takes you through examples of deploying servlet, JSP, Stateless and Stateful session beans, BMP and CMP Entity beans, and Message-driven beans together with some ancillary technologies such as JTA.Good as far as it goes, except that it focusses far too much on the generic rather than the specific issues of using these on Weblogic, which is why people will be buying this book!The unforgiveible thing about this book is twofold. The examples are filled with mistakes, and the publisher has no complaint or erratta mechanism at all. They have a 'contact Sams' link on their website but as far as I can tell it's for the order department! Mistakes are forgivable in any book given that there is a reasonably speedy mechanism for getting corrections out, but Sams seems to believe that the transaction ends once they have your money. After that you are on your own. Which is fine if it works."
2,reads like a poorly-written technical dissertation - avoid!!,"First, I'd like to implore Amazon to prevent racially inclined comments as presented by Ricardo Audano's review about this book on your website. Terrible books and writeups have crossed my table with authors from all spectrum of life - from all races, colors, and genders. So have many great books.Having said that, this book is simply awful! It shows that the authors know what BEA WebLogic can be used for and how, but they forget to tell you about it. It is as if you walked up to their desk one night and happened to pick up their scribbled notes. Examples strewn throughout the book are unnecessarily complex and without adequate explanations. Things seem out of sequence and new concepts are introduced without any prelude.So save your money and buy a better book..."
3,"Risqué, indeed","It was quite a bipolar experience to read about the discourses between Annie and the smart-alecky college guy. The author demonstrates a sophisticated vocabulary can indeed be applied to the most carnal pleasures. Funny and graphical, this book has a great ending. This is Max's first fiction."
4,Very nice socks,"I had bought socks similar to these from Wal Mart. They fell apart after a few wearings. So I paid a few dollars more, and bought Gold Toe this time. I know these will last a long time as my other Gold Toe socks are indestructible."
1,Not as advertised,"These socks are not made of combed cotton as advertised, and they contain 17% Polyester, which is not even listed as containing. They are very cheap feeling socks. They are already beginning to ""pill"" as polyester does over time. This is exactly the type of sock I prefer to stay away from. This has to be the worst quality Gold Toe product I have ever seen."
3,SOCKS,"WELL, AFTER WASHING, THESE SOCKS SHRINK JUST LIKE A CHEAP BRAND; MY HUSBAND NEEDS THE 13 TO 15 SIZE, BUT I MIGHT JUST AS WELL BUY THEM FROM A DISCOUNT STORE; THEY LAST ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME."
3,"Not bad, run small","These socks are a bit smaller than my other athletic socks. I thought maybe they were women's sized. They are plain, middle of the pack, ok socks. Not really a premium sock like the description implies."
5,"socks for ""Big Foot""","The socks fit comfortably and are well made. My only recommendation is to come out with the next size ... 15-17. Since I bought these socks my son has grown a little, now he has a size 16 foot. Where oh where can I find a size 15-17? I am counting on you Gold Toe!"
2,I was bored.,"I'm sorry to say it, but I was actually bored with this book.They seemed like cookie-cutter characters. But then again maybe I'veread one too many ""the bad-boy took her virginity and then skipped town to make a name for himself while the sweet heroine stayed in town living down her undeserved reputation"" books. Nice sex scene in the beginning. That's about the best of it. The characters were neither captivating, nor unique. The plot held precious few surprises. The resolution didn't require much, if any, internal sacrifice. Breathless just doesn't satisfy."
5,Sizzling & Hot!,"Kimberly Raye's first Blaze didn't disappoint! I loved this book and the characters. Sizzling sensuality and imagery. If you like them hot, this book's for you! Karen Drogin/Carly Phillips"
4,Great basics for Cajun cooking,"As a native of South Louisiana, I love Cajun cooking and have long read the Acadiana magazine, and saved recipes from it. This little cookbook takes thebest from the magazine. These are the basic recipes that we love--gumbo, etoufee, bisque, all the favorites of the region. There is a section for cooking game for those who like it. After traveling around this country and some places in Europe, I think the best food anywhere is South Louisiana Cajun cooking! I may be a bit biased, but someone must agree with me, since Cajun has become so popular. We were in a pub inEngland and Cajun food was on the menu. The book is simple and there are no pictures, but the recipes are easy to follow. For the price, well worth it."
5,The Magnifico of Magnificents,"This is the most incredibly delicious, robust - yet delicate - tomato sauce you will ever experience. Once you have had the pleasure of dining on a plate of Martelli's penne topped with this tomato sauce warmed and topped with a fresh grinding of good parmesiana, you will never be the same! It is truly a meal to be savored with every bite!!!"
3,gemini,"I just received this dvd today and was eager to try it out. I've been doing vinyasa flow and bikram for 1.5 years. Although this is a fairly good workout, its so different from what I'm used to. The sequence of asanas didn't have a natural flow, but it could be because its not what I'm accustomed to. I find he holds the relaxing poses too long, and the strength building poses, he's in and out of too quickly. What drove me crazy was Kest's incessant chatter. Part of yoga is being quiet. Its one thing to direct someone in the asanas, but this guy goes on and on about nonsense. Yoga is a personal journey and I find it mind numbing, even in a real class when an instructor tells you what you should be feeling. I'll continue with the dvd and as soon as I'm familiar with the sequence, I'll be hitting that mute button. This will be good when I travel."
3,Very difficult and frustrating for beginners,"I recommend you watch the video without exercising a couple of times because the commands are confusing when you are trying to get into the poses. ""Left foot here, right foot pointing here, breath out, put left hand where right foot used to be then do the hokey pokey without falling over. I imagine it gets easier as you learn them but I found his commands to rapid and poses very hard."
5,Bryan Kest Power Yoga Complete Collection,"I love this dvd. I had never tried yoga before this dvd, but I'm very glad I started with this one. Bryan Kest's Power Yoga is an intense workout that will definitely leave you feeling like you've worked hard. After two days, my whole body was sore, but in a good way. It targeted muscles that my usual kickboxing workouts never reached, and this dvd is definitely capable of making you sweat. I've tried various other yoga dvd's since starting with this one, and this one is still my favorite. The other dvd's just don't make me feed like I'm working quite as much as this one. This workout can also be worked on many levels. By that I mean that anyone can do the poses in this dvd because you only do them to your level of ability, and you can always push yourself farther. So you never completely master a workout. I think anyone interested in yoga who is looking for a challenging workout should try this dvd."
5,Can be tough if you take all the options! I love it!,"Finally, a DVD almost as tough as a class. I need more of these. I highly recommend this DVD. Some yoga DVDs seem to focus on the instructor more than the yoga. This guy does not. Fantastic."
1,Where are the 3 programs?,"I purchased this dvd a while back and should have returned it. I have now tried all 3 programs and they are exactly the same. So, either I received a defective dvd or there was some deception in advertising."
3,Not for a beginner,This video is really for advance people. The teacher has been practicing yoga for a long time.
3,not for basic beginners,"i found this set to be challenging and quite intensive. each time u work out to anyone of the tapes, u find ur capabilities have increased. once u are not starting yoga for the first time, then this is the set for you. each tape progresses with intensity but it's true what bryan says, focus on the breath. thank god there is no droning and his voice carries u through some of the more challenging poses."
2,not impressed,"This is my least favorite of all the yogo tapes I have seen and tried to do. I loved the regular yoga I had done, but wanted something a little more challenging to build more muscle. I bought this tape at a garage sale, and quickly learned why the owner didn't like it either. Basically the most annoying aspect was the teacher himself. In my opinion he talked too much, and didn't have a very soothing voice at all. The excersizes seemed alot more repetative than the other tapes I have done (and the classes I took)and the background and music were mediocre at best."
1,Don't Recomend,I bought this Product for my husband because of the Reviews. He didn't feel that it was as good as everyone says. He jumps to diffrent positions to much..
4,Good DVD,"This DVD is very good. It was a little hard for me b/c I am not that flexible, but it is very good for muscle toning and strength building."
4,One of the best,"Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series is one of the best at-home yoga classes I've taken. He explains and demonstrates each pose well, with minimal confusion or guessing. The workout is challenging but easy to adapt to any skill/experience level. He's a little geeky/dorky, but that gives the video ""real life"" quality that's easy to relate to (if you're a dork, too! hee). Actually, I really like his philosophy about yoga and about challenging ourselves as individuals, taking the ""competitive"" and ""perfection"" vibes out of yoga, which turns me off of many videos and classes. In short, a good workout that doesn't get boring."
3,Yoga with Fabio,"This is not a bad set of programs. In fact for their price, these three yoga classes are a great deal. That said, I wish he were less Hollywood and more real. He talks a lot about doing Yoga with the right intention, but I doubt he does Yoga for the right reasons. In these classes he sure seems to love himself and his awesome bod. I wish he had different music and more varied set of body types to demonstrate the classes. He does not give much or any instruction on how to do the yoga posses,nor does he give any modifications to the posses. Even though some of his students are advanced, many have horrible sway backs. There is no emphasis on lengthening the lower spine. Instead many of the students seem as if they are trying to curve their spines as much as possible while sticking out their derrieres. The programs do give you a variety of classes, and as I said the price is incredible, but is it too much to ask for Bryan to cover his manly chest and to put his cascading hair back?"
4,too much talk,"The actual yoga is a good workout, but listening to Bryan Kest talk and talk and talk gets annoying after the second or third time."
4,"3 routines of good, solid yoga","I was curious to see what Kest's ""Power Yoga"" was all about, and there is nothing too new here for anyone who has been to a bunch of yoga classes. These are primarily standard vinyasa moves, with a couple of minor modifications (such as Kest's optional push up in between updog and downdog). The best thing about this video is that it contains 3 complete routines, which are each different from one another, yet all are very much the in the same style. Kest's Power Yoga seems to put a bit more emphasis on aerobic moves and breathing, and less on complicated stretches. It is a good program. It seems that some people like poking fun at Kest's shirtless torso or rock star hair - well how about his husky voice and what seems to be a Massachusetts accent? Just kidding - he leads a good class, and if you do yoga at home from time to time (a real class is always better), you won't regret this purchase."
2,All about Brian Kest,"Brian Kest is clearly an accomplished yoga practitioner. This DVD seems to feature about 50% Brian -- talking, philosophizing, walking (strutting?) among his students, and yes, doing poses. With all that, no mention of ashtanga. I guess he's photogenic or something, but I didn't buy the DVD to look at Brian. I got it for the yoga. The first segment is NOT a beginner-level experience. The transitions from one pose to the next are rushed. The poses aren't explored or explained in detail (why we're doing this, what to emphasize or watch for, etc.) The editing seems to feature Brian, not the viewer's practice, at every opportunity. At the end, there's the traditional calm period, where he talks about how we should relax for a bit, but it's edited in half, so relaxing is suddenly over. In all, a disappointing DVD. And on top of that, the DVD was $17.95 when I bought it 33 days ago, and now it's $6.99. Bummed!"
3,My Review,"It was okay...the guy is kind of repetative with comments, and he tells you to just ""hang out"" like a MILLION times! It's a pretty good workout though...nothing super spectacular. He does really seem to love himself...there are several places in all three workouts where it flashes to just him and it becomes all black and white and he's all doing his yoga like he's ""Deeter"" in a Saturday Night Live spoof. Kind of funny, actually. It was alright."
2,Yoga with Yanni or Fabulous (?),The Yoga workout is just dandy. I can't use it because this guy is too much. Can't listen to him.
2,Too fast and not enough explanation!!,"Power Yoga is great, it is the up-beat i guess you would call it of yoga. Its almost the exact opposite of what you would expect of yoga to be.I bought this because of the fairly decent reviews and i was very disappointed to say the least. They do not show or explain every position enough and it gets extremely confusing when there are more than one person in a room and trying to do a position.Also everything starts to move too fast way too soon leading you to get irritated instead of relaxing you and helping you meditate.This is going out on my next yard sale maybe someone else likes Kest yoga style and teaching not me though!!I would not recommend this or any of his other DVD's nor would i buy any of his DVD's again."
2,might be OK if you're 20 and ripped!,"Mr. Kest apparently has no concept of ""beginner"". His easiest program is WAY over the head of this 50ish and very athletic lady. Unless you are extremely strong and totally flexible and have been doing Yoga for years, you risk injury if you try to keep up with even the easiest of these programs. He tells you to modify the poses to be easier - and do only what you can comfortably handle and breathe thru, but virtually all of the demos are at the most difficult level. His ""warm-up"" is no warm up, and initially, the length of time he has the demo people hold the poses is ridiculous although the pace picks up to be TOO quick toward the end."
4,Great workout,"This video provides an excellent workout for both stretching and strength building. To me it doesn't matter whether it's astanga yoga or not, I just want to improve my physique and this video does the trick. The only drawback is Bryan's stupid comments - if he'd only guide us through the poses without all that extraneous talk."
4,Looking forward to growing into this series!,I haven't actually done the workout yet but I have watched it through entirely first and I have tried more than enough yoga videos to know I will definitely be using this one for a long time to come. It really isn't for total beginners of power yoga...for that I would highly recommend Sean corns which is a great instructional video (I noticed that she is one of the class members in this video and she is awesome!). Once you've done that one a few times though you are ready for this one. I can see Brian does talk a little to much but once you do it a couple of times you could probably tune him out a little. I am really looking forward to doing these as I have tried others but didn't like that the poses weren't held for long enough. This would be 5 stars if he would choreograph a class and add his voice in later. Maybe then he would only speak as much as is absolutely necessary to just simply quide you into the poses and not chatter on unnecessarily.
4,I'm a tough customer and this one was good....,"Although I wish Kest would spend less time during the class talking about his philsophy... ""Be where you are, that is exactly where you should be"" (if I heard it one more time I was going to shut the video off). This is an excellent beginning Power Yoga tape.It gave good instructions for modifications between beginner and more advanced poses. Not too difficult but challenging enough.. this is a good tape for someone who has been practicing yoga for a few months and has decent flexibility.Glad I purchased..."
4,Good Video,"I have never done yoga before. I decided that I would like to try it. I purchased the video and really enjoyed it. I am not able to do everything. I enjoy the way he teaches and explains that everyone is different, having different abilities. I would recommend this video."
2,Not for beginner's,"I bought this based on another review on this product and I was disappointed. The monotone voice ,long hair. and Bryan strolling around shirtless in blue jeans is ridiculous for a fitness DVD. I have never done yoga and was looking for something with basic instruction. This DVD is for people who know how to move fluidly from one pose to the next. I understand that is what this type of yoga is about but I thought with the different DVD's it would gradually build up to that. I ended up purchasing ""Rodney Yees: Yoga for Beginners"" and like it much better."
4,"Weird accent, decent workout","Being that I'm a personal trainer and have been doing yoga for about 6 years, it takes a pretty good video for me to feel like I'm getting something out of it. The instructors accent was a little different, northeastern and yoga is a strange combo but he is a good teacher. Both the Tone and Sweat programs are challenging. I like the studio the video was shot in and people in the class are definately inspiring. He also gives differnet options for poses which would be nice for beginners and expert. Overall I think this video is a good value and worth the buy."
2,"Corny, slow video","I did not like this video at all. The flow is way too slow for me, and he spends too much time just walking around and talking. You don't really need a specific level of yoga to do it, since it seems to be all about the flexibility (even if he says it's not).All the people featured in the video seem to be extremely flexible (more like ballet dancer flexible not so much yoga), and the quality is mediocre at best. It feels like a cheap 80's setting.I did not enjoy, I did not sweat and I really won't do it again. If anyone wants my DVD they can have it for free.Not even comparable to Rodney Yee."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"This DVD would be just fine if only the ""background"" music was not so loud. It always competes with Kest's instruction, and at times actually drowns him out. It is very annoying, since most of the time, if you are doing the exercises, you don't want to look at the screen, just listening should be enough. I am very disappointed."
2,Not for beginners!,"I rented this video while shopping around for a good at-home yoga workout. I have gone to a handful of yoga classes at my gym and really like it, but Bryan Kest does not offer the detailed positioning instruction that I need. Also, half the time I don't even know I'm not positioned correctly, and that's why it's important for beginners to have an in-person instructor to physically adjust your position so your muscles can remember what the pose should feel like.Bryan's attitude is very encouraging and I'm sure I'll be able to work up to this level soon, but for now I'm still shopping for the best beginner's yoga video."
2,Poor audio quality & boring,What annoyed me most about this video was the ridicuously poor audio quality becaue the instructor is not mic'd. I also found the routines to be just ordinary. I sold my copy on e-bay.
4,"Good workout, production could be better","""Bryan Kest Power Yoga"" is a nice series of yoga routines. More side [instead of frontal] camera angles and the use the standard names for yoga postures would improve understanding the sequences.It's hard to find a good yoga dvd, and this provides a thorough workout at beginner/intermediate level."
5,Ideal for repeat viewings,"I'm a New Zealander living in Korea. I have been practicing yoga with this series of videos 3-5 times a week for 4 straight months.I look and feel much better as a result. The workouts are a somewhat emotional experience for me maybe because the yoga makes me breathe right, and because of how good I feel... I end each session with an unexplainable love for the world and peace-of-mind.It seems no matter how many times I watch the videos, I never tire of them -- they seem simple on the surface yet have immeasurable depth only realized after repeated viewings.His continuous narration is extremely beneficial in the long-term, as eventually, you not only understand how and why each pose is done, but you start to think like the true yogi that Bryan Kest is."
3,Not as good as expected but still useful,"I've been to Bryan Kest's real classes, and they're fantastic. Given that, the DVD is a bit disappointing. Regardless, the actual exercises are straightforward and pretty representative of a basic yoga class. It's a bit hard to take Bryan seriously in his jean shorts (who wears that to yoga?), but the guy knows what he's talking about so he still makes a good teacher."
5,This hits the spot,"I'd been practicing yoga for nearly 8 years now and have tried a good number of yoga dvds. Rodney Yee is too light and David Svenson is too advanced. But the Bryan Kest collection just hits the spot. It's challenging but still doable (some with a few more sessions) and always leaves me soaking in my sweat. With this workout, I don't feel the need to supplement it with another workout (for the session)."
3,good workout,"Bryan Kest is nice to look at and this video gives a good workout but he talks way too much. I prefer simpler instructions without all the chit chat between instruction. I sometimes tune him out so lose the next instruction. But, I am old. He does help to keep me young."
1,Bad,Its hard to write a negative review on something that should inspire the opposite. Bryan has the unfortunate way of almost barking his instructions and his twang made me uneasy for two times i tried the DVD for. If you are immune to his voice and posturing then i am sure there is a worthwhile few hours of yoge here for you. There are many teachers and DVDs that nudge the student into feeling the pose here we have Bryan strutting up and down the class like a bully.
2,well...,"i bought this set because i thought it would be a good workout. it looks like a great one but i can't stop laughing long enough to start doing the moves. i turn it on whenever i need a good laugh. the instructor takes himself WAY too seriously and the outfits he wears are also hilarious. the things he says are even amusing. if you can get past all that, more power to you."
1,Not for me,"I much prefer Rodney Yee. Bryan Kest appears a bit new-agey and strange to me. That's just preference, though. Not really for beginners, either."
1,not worth it,i usually put a lot of weight on the product review so i have to tell you its not worth ur money...its about 1:30 of routine and thats it...the guy wears jean?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!!??! and it just seems outdated i regret the purchase
1,Lame,"This is not a good video. The guy just wants to show his own body.Yoga is about flowing from pose to pose. This video has no flow. It shows the people in a class with Bryan teaching them moves, then all of a sudden breaks to a separate shot of Bryan with no shirt on doing the move somewhere else. How am I supposed to get into my flow when I keep having to look at this guys long nasty hair and hairy chest? I do not recommend this video."
4,"Good yoga, mediocre DVD quality","Bryan's power yoga always gives me a good work out at the studio, and this DVD more or less provides a similar level of workout.The sequences of the poses, and Bryan's explanation, are very good. Bryan's constant reminder of adapting the asanas to your own body, and his emphasis of breathing are extremely valuable for someone who is still learning the ropes about yoga.The DVD editing, and the video quality can be improved, however. Sometimes I think due to trying to fit 3 sessions onto a single DVD, the editor had to cut some repetitions, making following the exact movement and breathing a bit difficult. This may have contributed some other users' complaints about not having enough warm up. Video and audio quality are mediocre, especially the voice recording is not always the best, even metalic sometimes. With that said, it is a good value for having all 3 levels in one. I wouldn't mind paying a little more for a better production quality video though."
3,Bryan Kest Power Yoga,"This DVD is definitely for the more experienced because they move in and out of poses very quickly and u cannot watch the screen, u must listen to the instruction. If u look, then u will not be doing poses properly! Its better to watch it first then try."
3,Unrated but should be!,"Overall this is a fine, challenging yoga DVD for those with some yoga experience and a good fitness level. However the production is really distracting; all the participants are dressed in tight white underwear and the cameramen focus on their ""bulges"" and Bryan Kest provocatively grabbing them in intimate spots to guide their poses rather than showing us clearly how the poses should look. It seems like he is going for a ""avant garde, sexy"" ambiance but it gets really annoying if you are just focusing on getting a good yoga workout."
4,Cheesy but great workout,"This is a great workout and when you start out it might look easy but unless you're already in great shape its not, but when you get past that you can really feel a difference. (Getting a yoga mat would be a good advise before starting the workout)"
4,"Good video, Tough","I'm intermediate level and this video is a challenge. I have to work to get through just the first video let alone the 2nd and 3rd. Lots of good arm work though. I like that it's a good strength training workout without needing weights. Bryan is a good instructor regardless of the 90s cutoff jeans he wears. The 90s style clothing is only distracting the first couple of times I did the video, didn't affect the quality of the workout.This video is a good choice if you just want a couple of yoga videos to round out your collection and mix things up. I have a few other yoga videos from Gaiam that are good for stretching but this is a fun one for making you sweat."
4,Worth it,"before i bought this video, i had never done yoga before. and never wanted to either. triathlon. check. marathons. check. weight training. check. but after years of abusing my body through these pursuits i was ready for some healing. so i turned to yoga. i was too intimidated to take a class so i bought this video through a recommendation. and i'm glad i did. just the fact that there are 3 classes in one dvd is refreshing. the beginner class is a great introduction to power yoga - challenging but doable. plus bryan's mantra, ""if you're breathing and feeling something you're doing it right"" is welcoming. 4 months later i can do most of the advanced class and have even gained the confidence to take an actual yoga class at a studio. in fact, both times i've been to santa monica on business, i took classes at bryan's studio - and i was able to keep up with the class!anyway, i highly recommend this video for beginner to intermediate yogis."
3,"A cheesy DVD, but a good workout...","If you can get past all the cheese and bad porn-like vibe...it's actually a good workout. I felt challenged, and definitely felt worked the next day. It was hard to take it seriously sometimes though! Really...spandex tights/shorts under jean cutoffs? Would you take that seriously? If you can get past all that, and not laugh too much, it's a good workout."
2,NOT for Beginners,"I have only made it through the first video in this series and I found it difficult. To begin with the workout is very fast paced and Kest does not show you the proper poses as I would expect a beginner tape to do. The people shown taking the class appear very advanced and are in no way beginners. In addition, I found Kest's constant jabbering extremely annoying and this made it difficult to get into the right frame of mind. I much prefer Yoga Zone and Rodney Yee's tapes to these and think they are much better suited for beginners. I did not enjoy this tape."
2,"Excellent for stretching, not much of a ""workout"" though.","The stretching and poses are excellent but I thought the words ""power yoga"" ""sweat"" and ""strength"" were rather misleading. If you are already fairly fit, these videos probably aren't going to make you break a sweat or gain strength. The only strength-related pose involved one pushup every few minutes. For beginners, this would be challenging, (the instructor says ""don't worry if you can't do a full pushup!"") but for people who are already fit it's pretty tame. The poses do provide a great stretch though.I found the host of this series to be very annoying. He's pretty dorky and new-agey."
3,"Challenging, but not relaxing","Here's the best example of why I only rate this DVD at 3 stars: at one point in the first program, Kest tells us to take 5 deep breaths. In all the times I've done the program, I can never complete more than 3 shallow breaths. He simply rushes on before considering the amount of time such breathing takes. And that's the overall feeling I have of the DVD, too busy, too much talking by Kest. He repeats several mantras, such as ""There's no perfect pose"" and ""It's not what you do, it's how you do what you do,"" to the point they become irritating.There's no question he knows what he's doing, and he demonstrates the poses nicely, though he doesn't do a very good job of showing alternates for those of us not as limber as his class members. But the DVD is not what I'd expect from a yoga experience, due mainly to Kest's constant talking."
1,I must be missing something...,"I read the other reviews and was excited to get the tape. I was disappointed. The video is almost an hour and was filmed while the instructor teaches a class. There are lots of long pauses while he walks around correcting his students positions. Meanwhile, you are stuck at home doing nothing for several long gaps while in an awkward position. It just didn't flow. Also, many of the positions are very difficult to do. Power Yoga for Beginners is a much better tape."
5,"Wonderful, Moving, Powerful","This is my absolute favorite dvd for home practice. The first class is intermediate beginner, I'd say, while the subsequent classes are gradually more difficult. I've tried many different dvds and classes, and this always remains my go-to for a calming, yet energizing practice. It's bare-bones, I like to say; no modern, new age add-on's, only solid, fluid asanas and transitions. I feel more amazing after this practice than I do any other time of the day, and there's another upside: if you're looking for a gentle weight loss regime, this might work for you. I've upped my practice to at least 5 times a week within the last couple months(because I've been a bit stressed lately, and this helps like nothing else) and I dropped about 7 pounds. That's not the point of yoga, of course, and you shouldn't enter into a practice with the sole ambition of losing weight, but it certainly didn't upset me that I was feeling better on the inside and looking better on the outside :)"
5,Excellent DVD,"This DVD moves along at a good pace for me and is challenging - I have done different ""types"" of yoga for 15 years now. This is based on Ashtanga yoga. It is like being a class in many ways; I can play the DVD and follow along without having to look at the screen if I want; if I need clarification I can look up and it's there in front of me. Some yoga vids are not as easy to follow. If you are a beginner, I would say that this will be challenging if you do not know modifications to the poses; however once you've done some yoga, definitely get this series and challenge yourself. It's a great workout. I trust Kest's instructions and agree with his philosophies. He is not so airy-fairy as to be annoying, but is definitely mindful of whole body and spirit. Each program is well-balanced and targets my entire body and I have time to get into each pose and focus my mind at the same time. I really appreciate this DVD."
3,Boot Camp Yoga!,"Don't get me wrong, the poses look amazing and I bet you get a great workout out of them. The only problem is I can't sit down and do the darn thing because of the tension and harshness. I love yoga because it allows me to work out, feel good, and most importantly relax. I feel like Brian is yelling at me the whole time which is NOT relaxing. I mean really, I have Tae Bo and Billy Blanks is easier to take than Brian. So the moves are good, but if you are looking for a difficult set and a relaxing atmosphere to get through it....this is not the DVD for you. If you like boot camp style yoga go for it! I personally have a hard enough time getting up in the morning early to work out and don't like someone yelling at me :) Hope this is helpful..."
5,Great for mind to body focus,"Who says you have to be flexible and strong to perform Yoga?!?! These videos are perfect for the beginner to the advanced Yogi. Mr. Kest shows you the proper breathing techniques needed to stay focused through each move. He not only tells you, but shows you how to properly perform each move without having to overwork yourself to try to keep up with the more advanced moves, which he also shows you how to properly perform. This is not just another workout video that will just sit in your collection of VHS tapes and collect dust. Just one hour a day to keep the rest of your day calm and focused."
4,Great yoga workout,"I have really loved doing this yoga tape! I always feel like I get a great workout. I do feel, however, that there is a little too much emphasis on ""down dog.""I am definitely going to buy his other two videos in the series.Highly recommended to anyone who loves yoga!"
3,Bryan Kest Power Yoga DVD,"Very dated, I think he's wearing blue jeans in one of the sessions! Basic fundamentals are there but there are better sources."
5,"Power yoga, Volume 1","Excellent. We did it in a mixed group and most of the guys thougth it would be silly. Oh boy did they find out. Sweating and swearing at the screen was only the beginning but then only to find themselves hailing Kest at the end and running quickly to purchase their own copies. Highly recommended for those bored with Aerobics but also bored with meditative yoga practices. You will get in shape, just take your time.And to all the other reviewers out there...isn't his brother the well known yoga instructor in Southfield, Michigan and isn't Brian a Detroiter too...not a Jersey boy? Either way, he rocks."
4,the quickest toning I've ever had,"This is my first experience with power yoga. Brian is wonderful at explaining all the poses and providing encouragement along the way. I have always worked out, but never had the results this has provided. I noticed toning in places I've been trying to target for years. It is great for mind and body."
3,Bryan Kest Power Yoga,"I didn't find a smooth flow to the positions. I would have liked him to say the yoga names of each upcoming pose so I would be able to move into position without have to look at the screen to see what was next. It felt very choppy to me. I would have liked to begin with breathing poses, moving into sun salutations to loosen up first."
5,Get some strength.,"This was my first yoga purchase and I am very pleased with it. I was looking for a dvd with a beginner, novice, and advanced feature on it and this dvd definetly has it. Brian Kest runs through each work out very smoothly and calmly, his voice is very soothing and it's easy to relax to. Some of the moves are a little bit hard to hold in the beginning and during the beginning I had to come out of most of the poses, but as I got stronger I could do them for the longer duration on the dvd. I would definetly recommend it for any one looking for a good yoga workout. Beginners though beware, the beginners workout on this dvd might be a little bit tough!!"
2,Couldn't even finish the DVD...,"With his rushed delivery and his aggressive, boyish swagger, it was a little hard to take Kest seriously. I tried to at least give the DVD a chance, and do the 1st level through to the end, but I found that even for all the words Kest was cramming into the available amount of time, he failed to teach the poses in a manner appropiriate for beginners to learn the poses safely and correctly. For the experienced practitioner, his chatter was distracting and even patronizing.One demographic this DVD may appeal to however, is people who think they're too ""manly"" to do yoga--still, this DVD would be better as an intro rather than a CD to practice regularly with."
3,Eye candy,I didn't get much exercise from this video - mostly because it was more advanced than I was ready for at the time - but this guy sure is fun to watch. ;)
1,I wasted my money!,"Not for the person who needs relaxation during their yoga practice. All three programs are basically the same workout, and the yoga student spends most of the workout in downward dog pose.While Bryan is a good instructor, he spends very little time in meditation at the end of the video, and NEVER stops talking. The is not real yoga.Caution: If you have back or wrist pain, these workouts are NOT for you. Please be careful."
1,Spare yourself,"I bought this yoga video based on the reviews. I was looking for something new and on a different level. This was not it. If you are used to the simple meditative Living Arts videos this is definately not for you. I like to get into a quiet state of mind when doing yoga, this guy nearly drove me nuts. He never shut his mouth, and went on and on about nothing, until I had to turn it off."
2,It's a good workout. Could be a better video.,It seemed as though all 3 parts were the same. I did not find much difference in the 3 parts.
3,Not so great,"First of all, the quality of tape is awful. Nearly ruined my vcr. Aside from that, I cannot believe this new jersey looser - without a shirt (!) is teaching yoga. The taped class is not too good - much less challenging than your average ""power"" yoga class. I suppose it could be worse."
2,Don't do it,"I just hope that for those of you using this video, that this is not your only exposure to yoga. Nothing beats a live class. This video, compared to a good yoga class, is a joke."
4,Fantastic,I have been doing yoga for about a year and this video has become one of my favorites. I started off with an AM/PM DVD with Rodney Yee and enjoyed it but did not feel very challenged. I moved to a Power Yoga DVD by Rodney Yee and found it very challenging. I did that for about 6 months and then needed something different. Bryan Kest instructs more during the video then Rodney. He walks you through all of the posses and makes you really feel part of his class. Rodney goes through the posses with out any type of conversation. If you need encouragement during your workout then this Power Yoga would be a great choice. The DVD has three workouts each one harder then the next.
5,Bryan Kest at his BEST,"This dvd set is amazing! This is Bryan Kest at his best (this was filmed quite a while ago!) This yoga is for no wimps though... so hang tight because you're going on a ride of extreme yoga! Bryan has such a way of pushing you to go further in your practice. However, you don't feel overwhelmed... he is very incouraging and before you realize it, you just held Half Moon for an HOUR! No, seriously, this is a workout, but, you also know by the end you have just been ""opened"" up... mind, body and spirit. Plus, who cares if he's another pretty face in yoga, he's still an awesome teacher. I highly recommend this dvd.. PLUS, it's on sale now too! TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
4,good,Good stuff but weird intros to classes. Just a personal thing.. what was he doing standing in an alley talking about yoga?
4,Good Stretch,"At first I was a little put off by the instructor's personality, but by the end of my first viewing I loved this dvd and the instructor had grown on me. Very 80's. It's a good all-over stretch and gets the heart pumping (sweat!)."
1,Weak video,Having watched and practiced nine yoga videos this year I have to say that this was the worst video - I hope nobody has hurt themselves doing it. Read some of other negative reviews to know why and notice that other Videos have all positive recommendations. The best videos on the market I've tried are: Total Yoga with Tracey Rich or David Swenson's Ashtanga tapes. If you are new to Ashtanga/Power/Vinyasa Yoga then Power Yoga (stamina version) with Rodney Yee is good.
5,Feels like your in the class,I realy like the style of this yoga dvd. It made me feel like I was part of the class. It wasn't overly challenging or too easy for me. I would say it was just right. Like he says in the dvd there are no perfect poses. I could do this dvd for years and still have room to improve. I was skeptical about the production being over 10 years ago. But it has the same names and movements we use today so I did not find that this made any difference.
5,Fabulous yoga DVD,"I was interested in doing yoga in my home - this was a perfect DVD. It has three different routines/workouts each being as difficult as you would like to make them. It's great for a beginner like me, but I can see how it will still be a great DVD for a more experienced person as well. It's very challenging, but Bryan Kest's calm reassurances are just what I needed."
4,"Good workout, but I could do without the monologues","I've been using this video for a long time and the longer I use it, the more annoyed I become with Bryan. Maybe it's because I can recite the entire video word for word and hearing myself say his words make me realize how stupid it sounds. He drives me insane. I do think that some of previous reviewers were right in saying that he's an egomaniac. And I'm surprised no one has mentioned how ridiculous his girlfriend is. She cracks me up with her posing and fancy flair moves. I can just picture these two going to juice bars and expecting everyone to recognize them and treat them like stars.Other than Bryan and his heavily researched thesaurus-based monologues, this is a great workout and would only be better if you could follow it on mute."
1,Dangerous!,"There is not enough warm up in this video, and it leaves one prone to injury! You have to get some blood to the shoulders before holding upper push up lower push up, or downward dog. All three of these are done right at the beginning, with no warm up!! For this reason alone, avoid this video."
1,This is not what yoga is about,"Instructors like Kest are the reason yoga is so misinterpreted in the U.S. This DVD is not real yoga. Yoga is about transformation and using the body to slow the mind (which eventually leads to enlightenment), not getting a workout while watching a porn-star looking man in jeans graphically touching male and female students (the male on sweaty male ""adjustments"" are very creepy even for an open minded liberal yogi). It's interesting all the good reviews on this product say ""it's a good workout,"" when that is so far from what yoga is about. If you want exercise, go to the gym. If you're going to try yoga, do it for the right reasons and try a purer form of the practice. Bryan Kest's practice is flat-out disrespectful to a beautiful, ancient practice."
2,Yablo Yoga,Wow! This video is quite dated. You may be better off just turning on your own music and doing your home practice poses.
1,Disappointed,"Ugh - I was really excited to get this dvd, but I popped it in the player and had to turn it off. I just couldn't stand his voice! It really grated on my nerves and I couldn't work through it. Oh well, back to the drawing board."
2,Rent before buy,"I don't actually own this video. I'm not the kind of person who buys a pair of shoes without trying them on first. The same goes for exercise videos. I've learned to add them to my NetFlix queue and experiment before making a commitment. I've adopted this pattern after collecting an embarrassing number of barely used exercise videos that while all promising to better the others, suffer from poor audio or irritating glitches that display poor production methods. I racked up plenty of balmost new videos that offer marginal re-gifting options. Fortunately, our public library and Goodwill accepts these donations with open arms."
3,Ummm.,"I love yoga, love, love, love.The yoga looks good in this video however... Watching this guy and the other males go through the positions makes me feel weird. The white outfits only makes me feel weirder. I found the best video in existence for yoga (beats most classes) but I'm just going to keep that as my little secret."
1,Outdated!,"I was highly dissappointed with this video. It says it is from 2004, but the Copyright on the back says 1995 and you and can tell! Yuck!Anyway, I did not like the style of his presentation at all. Very slow and boring and he has a bit of a mushmouth."
4,"Porn Star Material, but a heck of a workout!","A little bird told me that Brian Kest could get a little frisky, but my goodness! This was some good entertainment while I was holding some of the most difficult poses I have ever done in my life! I've only been doing yoga for a few months and still call myself a beginner, but my goodness am I sore after trying this DVD out yesterday for the first time. It's really hard to hold a downward dog for like a half hour while laughing at Brian's Michael Bolton locks and blue jeans :) The man knows his stuff though and designed a great workout- and who says that working out can't also be entertainment?"
1,Bryan Kest Power Yoga,"I've been doing yoga for years, in studio and by dvd. This is one of the worst videos of yoga I've seen. It looks like it was done in a warehouse in...well, I won't say what state. Just can't take a guy serious who shows up looking like ""Fabio"" wearing knee length blue jeans w/ white spandex showing underneath. I'll stick w/ Rodney Yee or Jonathan Urla (yogalates) when doing yoga at home. If I could get my money back on this I would. After reading the reviews I really expected something better; this is a very disappointing video!"
2,This video is far below the standards I expected....,"Too much style and not enough substance. As an intermediate/advanced level Ashtanga student, I can safely say that Mr. Kest has a huge ego problem as the video puts way too much attention on him and his bad boy good looks with gauzey shots and hard body close ups and not enough time on the actual work, I was very dissapointed. Also the tape runs 36 minutes long, not the advertised 54 minutes, a rip off."
1,Don't buy this lousy video,I've been practicing yoga for 5+ years.The first move he had us do caused my back to hurt.Poor description of poses. Poor sound quality.Irritating unhelpful chatter. No way to know what poseis coming up.
2,Power Yoga with Bryan Kest,"DVD stopped working after 2nd time I used it. I would not recommend this seller, but I did like the 2 practices I had with Bryan Kest."
1,Not a good yoga video series,"I just tried this yoga series. After practicing for 8.5 years I honestly did not find this very challenging and that's what I was looking for. The cuing for poses is not good unless you are familiar with poses and in particular sequence of poses. I did like his message and feel that's the best thing about this video series. I'd actually like to try a live class with him at some point. I just don't think it's the best video series available for at home practice. That said, I will reiterate his message is very good."
1,Looking for you inner zen? try elsewhere,"OMG, Bryan Kest, shut up, shut up, SHUT UP! This guy would not stop talking, except, of course, to grope the nearest human being. Not a particularly unique or inspiring series of asanas. Body's right and left sides got uneven attention."
2,Dissatisfied,"I found Bryan Kest to be very annoying -- he never shuts up and has a very annoying voice. Some of the poses are tough, and it is a decent workout, but I couldn't get past his jabbering throughout the entire video. I had to give this one away. I much prefer Rodney Yee's videos."
4,He Will Haunt Your Dreams,"Awesome workout. Well crafted. Sadly, it's one of the better DVDs on the market. I have just one caveat...WARNING: Do not look him in the eye. His yogi eyes and manly eyebrows will stare at you through your TV and into your soul. You will be mesmerized by all the hairless, bare chested men bending and stretching. This is to say nothing of the woman in the awesomely tacky thong.SPOILER ALERT!: The best scene is at the end of the third workout where a shirtless Brian Kest leans on another shirtless dude and puts his cheek on the guy's back with Bryan's awesome curly hair cascading down the other dude's back. If you put that in a parody about yoga, it's so over the top that no one would believe it."
2,"great body, horrible production quality","We do a yoga video each morning and this one was poor. The que's were bad and late, and it was just Bryan walking around a class in cut off jeens. The video was grainy but worst was the audio. It was almost too poor to listen to. We have a really good sound system and TV so it matters when the production does not even bother to use a mic. Now, Bryan's body is great and his power is amazing and that is why this is not a one star. I would love to take a live class from Bryan. I think it would be great, but the video for us was a one time watch due to the production quality issues."
2,Not for beginners and not good,"There is no doubt that Bryan Kest is good at yoga, but based on this video I am very skeptical of his skill as a teacher. I am familiar with yoga, and I'm not in terrible shape, and there is NO way this video is for beginners. I didn't like anything about it. Not the look, not the music, and especially not his nonstop new-agey babbling as he wanders around, touching his students inappropriately. It would have been helpful as I tried to replicate some of the postures, to see a whole person, rather than various body parts of the lithe, professional dancer types undulating through the difficult routine. I actually laughed out loud at one ""beginner"" move that I was supposed to be able to do, I would maybe be able to achieve it with human growth hormones and several months of weight training to build up my arm strength."
5,Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Collection,"This is by far one of the best yoga series DVD's I have ever used. I use it on a regular basis and Bryan Kest talks me through each workout as if I were physically in one of his classes. For anyone serious about Power Yoga, this DVD is a MUST have!!"
2,Repetitive,"First of all, to say there are 3 complete workouts on this video is a bit misleading. Technically, this is a true statement- however the 3 workouts are all *very* similar to one another, so it's not like you're getting 3 different workouts. This video is hard to follow because the audio isn't very good- rather than explaining the moves clearly, Brian Kest spends most of the time trying to be profound and inspirational. But he comes off as creepy. He seems to be completely unaware of the fact that if I'm in a downward dog, I can't see the screen, so the audio needs to be spot on.The overall production value of the DVD is very low (the video is grainy and low quality). Pretty disappointed."
5,Great workout,"I bought this DVD a month ago and the workout routines are great. I have been only doing the first 2 routines and they are challenging. I have been pleasantly surprised at my improved flexibility, muscle tone and strength from these workouts. I highly recommend buying this DVD if you want to do a challenging and effective yoga workout."
2,This is POWER yoga! Not for the faint at heart,A yoga teacher recommended this video to me - talk about out of touch with her student!! If you want POWER yoga this is fine. Someone commented that the participants in the class looked like beginners - my foot! They looked like they had done ballet for years. I'll keep trying but this is definitely what the title says -- POWER yoga.
2,"eh, frustrating","This 'Frogger Beyond' game would be SOOOO much better if you could contrtol the camera, but alas, you cannot.Many many times you end up jumping off the board, jumping to a place you didn't want to jump to, but you could swear the floor continues...Well, bottom line, this COULD be a fun and difficult puzzle game, but instead it's just frustrating and not worth my time. I don't like not being able to see what I'm doing. (i also don't like the Resident Evil games where you walk around ""blind"" corners right into enemies.)Nice try..."
3,"Outdated, but still fun...","The game is good and offers hours of entertainment. It can be played on the Wii, but it still requires that you use a GameCube controller. (You can only use the D-Pad, which was less than well designed for the GameCube). Buttons on the controller often get ""sticky"" with use and cause Frogger to do unwanted things that almost always end in death."
4,A Great Coffee Table Filler,"If you don't have the calendars, this is an excellent way to get some of the delightfully artistic photographs of the creepy exhibits at the Mütter Museum. My primary complaint is that the text is often a bit short on detail, but it could very well be that not that much is known about some of the specimens. Also, the lack of photographs of some of the most interesting exhibits - such as the Soap Lady and the Giant Colon - is annoying, especially since they don't let you take pictures yourself at the museum. But there are more than enough fascinating photographs to make this a worthwhile addition to morbid coffee tables everywhere!"
3,Leaves A Lot to be Desired ....,"Some photographs are very interesting, but space was wasted on several exhibits being shown more than once - sometimes more than twice; most of these repetitions aren't really worthy of more than one photograph.In order to fully appreciate the scanty captions (every picture has a caption but not much of one), more than cursory knowledge of medical terminology is required; otherwise, a medical dictionary would be helpful.At the risk of showing my ignorance, I thought that the Mutter Museum was almost strictly abnormal medical exhibits. I didn't realize that there were so many graphic examples of human anatomy - hence, the three stars instead of two; this book gives a nicely rounded ""tour"" of the museum.If possible, I would strongly suggest checking this book out from a library before buying it without flipping through it."
5,Very Chilling!,Great Book! Pictures are graphic though. Bought this for my daughter starting college next year. She is hoping to become a virologist at the CDC.
5,A must for fans of medical Photography,"I purchased this as well as the other Mütter Museum book and I don't regret it at all. The images are really quite beautiful and the essays are engaging. There are better books for more in depth analysis of specific items from medical collections, but this book definitely has the most compelling imagery."
3,interesting but,"I was a bit disapointed in the book. The pictures were beautifully done, but there was little information on the subjects. My interest was more in the people or bodies photographed, and I guess I felt cheated by not knowing more about them."
2,nice vocal . . . bad French,"Too bad Julio doesn't speak French. Someone needs to tell him that final endings are usually not pronounced. Otherwise, the music was a re-hash of many of his earlier works in Spanish and English, but they were good to hear again."
5,Classic Disney -- just like I remember it!,"I love this collection. It has so many cartoon shorts that I remember from my childhood--especially Ben and Me, The truth about Mother Goose, and Paul Bunyan. This is highly recommended."
3,where's the paper ID band?,"As a longtime Treasures collector I was disappointed that the Disney Rarities I ordered from Amazon arrived without the paper name/ID# band that came wrapped around the tin. The WWII Treasures even came with a camouflage band. Anyone know if this is an Amazon glitch, or has Disney dropped them from this new series? They're a great way to ID the tins when they're on the shelf."
1,Don't waste your money.......,False advertising!! These shorts have NOT been remastered. The quality is poor and definately not up to Disney standards. I am shocked at some of the seasoned reviewers on Amazon that gave this 5 stars without even addressing the quality issue. Even worse is the reviewer who acknowledged that these shorts are not remastered but gave the collection 5 stars anyway. Disappointing. Don't let nostalgia cloud your decision to accept an inferior product.
2,Selection = A+ Quality = F,"Disney really dropped the ball on this year's wave of Treasures. While the selection of shorts on this and the Donald set are unsurprisingly good, most of the video masters used are atrocious and seem to be left over from pre-digital days. Perhaps they thought that nobody would notice. Guess what, Disney? We noticed."
4,Disney Rarities,"This unusual DVD collection has cartoons before even Mickey Mouse called the Alice Comedies, World War II cartoons, Academy Award winners like Ferdinand the Bull and Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom and stop-motion cartoons right before Walt's death. I love it. Where elase will you find musical cavemen and peaceful bulls beside Disneyland?"
5,"Walt Disney Treasures - Disney Rarities - Celebrated Shorts, 1920s - 1960s",These DVDs are in perfect condition - with hours of classic Disney cartoons to enjoy.
4,childhood memories,"while I loved these cartoons as they brought back all my childhood memories, I was dissapointed in Toot Whistle Plunk Boom. some of the narration is missing. even though the background music plays, I can only tell what's being said if I turn on the subtitles. has anyone else had this problem? other than that, I love this DVD. great selection of cartoons!"
2,Disappointed,"Purchased as a Christmas present. From the outside I saw no major damage. Just a small depression in the corners of the metal case. When the package was opened and the overwrap was removed, it was discovered that there were A VERY LARGE DENT and other impressions in the back of the metal box. The contents appeared to be in good condition. However, the collector tin is worthless. The outside packaging was in good condition and the label under the shrinkwrap that covered the damage was unmarked leading me to believe it left the factory that way. The content is good, but the condition of the collector tin was horrible."
5,Awesome,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I absolutely love this CD. I have a 6 CD changer in my car and 4 of the CDs that never come out are all Keith Urban. I know this is his earlier work but it's all Keith. I also bought a copy for my friend and she loves it. Keith just writes the best songs and I if I'm sad or depressed all I have to do is listen to Keith and I can't help but smile. This CD is terribly under rated... If your a Keith Fan its a must have."
5,Keith Urban Rocks!,I was so excited to see that there was more work available from Kieth Urban to discover when I saw this CD. I just can't get enough of his music! This CD is a close rival of his indiviual releases. A must have for any big fan! I also have a 6 CD changer with the 4 CDs from Keith loaded permanently! He really does speak to you with his music. All I can say isd that I want more!! Way to go for Male Vocalist of the Year 2004!!
4,First and Best,"This is the first time America got to here the unique country sound of The Ranch. Fronted by Keith Urban, The Ranch walks the edge of rock and country in this debut release.The first cut, ""Walk In The Country"" gets the blood pumping and hints at the sound of The Ranch. ""Just Some Love"" first strikes you as another cheesy love ballad, but it's catch phrases will keep this song in your head all day long. If ""Some Days You Gotta Dance"" doesn't get you dancing, then you need to turn up the volume. If you like haunting country ballads with an edge, ""Ghost In This Guitar"" will be one you listen to more than a few times.Overall a really good CD, if you like a little spice in your country. It is better than anything Urban has done since going solo, and always finds a place in my CD player a few times a year."
1,Dont buy this book,"I bought this guide for the summer I am spending in cyprus. The author clearly didnt like the island: his description of most things are tainted with a negativity and he clearly didnt get beyond the tourist traps. \he left out essential info on buses and hotels. If I had stuck with the book I never would have discovered the wonderful things that the island has to offer. If you cant find a good book, rather look at online sites (like gonomad.com has great info)."
4,Great for the independent low-budget traveler!,"I used the Rough Guide last spring when I traveled independently to Cyprus from Israel. I found it to be very comprehensive and accurate. There are lots of maps, phone numbers and other useful info. It is great for someone wanting the nitty-gritty details of how to get around and how much money to bring. I especially appreciated the suggestions for good low-budget accomodations."
4,Pretty Good CD,"The CD is pretty good, I like most of all of the tracks, especially ""Posted""! Ludacris and Shawwna did there thang, but the others, well, wasn't as good though, but I do give them props. You should get this CD if you want to hear some hot beats by Ludacris and the DTP"
5,"""Golden Grain"" is an awesome cd","DTP(Disturbing the Peace) has a release of their first cd out in stores now and its called ""Golden Grain"". This CD is amazing the song are all good. There isn't one that I dont like. All of the skits are hilarious... I laughed for hours. My favorite song on the cd is R.P.M. It is crazy how fast they are rapping. This CD is by far one of the best CD's in my case and im sure it would look great in yours too. You should definately considering picking up this album... thanks!"
4,This CD Rules,Ludacris always rocks da mic. if u like ludacacris then u'll like DTP's cd Golden Grain. also check out cris's cd 'Chicken and beer'.
1,HORRIBLE,"this album [is bad], the only good thing about it is the HILARIOUS Big Chain records skit. Horrible"
2,Only 2 stars for the effort...Disappointing!!,"After listening to this album several of times I just can't get into it like I can when I am listening to a Ludacris Album.I would have to say about 2 of the songs are good on the cd which are the ""Growing Pains-remix"" and ""R.P.M."" featuring Twista.I felt the album was put together in a hurry and it could have been produced better.I highly recommend that you preview this album before buying it because it didn't move me at all so thats why I only can give it 2 stars which is because of the effort."
2,Everybody ain't got it...,This CD should be taken off the shelf. It seems money can by everything but a REAL mc or in this case mc's.If it wasn't for a track by Shawnta (shauna) I would see how fast it takes vinyl to burn. I was gonna put some of these tracks on a mix tape but I suddenly can't find any more room. I am shocked that Ludacris is even down with these kids. Thumps down.Save your money. Buy a DVD.
2,"DTP: Disappointing, Terrible, and Pathetic",The DTP Golden Grain album was a huge disappointment. After hearing Luda's Back for the First Time and Word of Mouf I thought this album was garbage.Yeah there are a few good tracks such as R.P.M. and The Growing Pains RMX but 85% of the songs on here are just throwaway tracks.They put Move B**** on here as a bonus track but who needs that when it was already on Word of Mouf.I listened to the album in its entirety and I wanted to like it but I mostly despised it. I'm ready for the new Ludacris album to be released though which will definatley surpass this disaster.
1,Disturbing the Ears,"Hey Amazon is there any way to give out 0 stars? E-mail me and let me know. This album is very dissapointing, sort of like when Tyson lossed to Lenox Lewis. You want to root for DTP on this one but it just doesnt work. Luda's crew give a whole new meaning to waste of space. It's a shame when the best performance on the album is a outside guest(Twista). This is coming from a Ludacris fan. I think that DTP sound decent on all other Ludacris projects but not this. Ludacris threw them in the water to swim and you know what they say about black people, we cant swim. So there you have it. Golden Grain gets a big Golden Shower from Dooky breath."
3,Just Average,"D.T.P.'s album didn't come up to my expectations. Shawna & Luda are the only one's who come off good. Their guest appearances also shine, especially Twista. Best song is Growing Pains. I can listen to that over and over. Everything is alright or wack. Hope they do better next time."
2,Not spicy at all,"This is not a spicy mix. It has a good variety of things in it, but some are very hard, so throwing a small handful in your mouth is not fun. The peas are just dried peas, and even the crackers have no taste to them. It isn't even really salty. I would not spend almost $9.50 on this."
4,Too pricey for the thin material,"Product is not bad. It has reinforced ribbing along the seams, which of course strengthens it a bit. But for $5+ it's too pricey. I had expected a thicker plastic and it is thoroughly see-thru. But for travel, especially for airport security, it's perfect and functional. I do not reget buying this, but I can't say I would buy it again. I'm sure I could find one elsewhere for lesser price."
5,Dr. Doka knows his field well,an informative and well organized treatment of this subject. Well received. I would recommend without reservation for anyone grieving and for professional therapists to review.
4,book review,"the book seems to be in good order, arrived in orderly fashion, i havent used it yet, but its in decent used condition."
4,Good book,"This is based on the older published version but with updated material like newer ignition and emission regulation. This book has more colored pictures than the previous edition.I generally like the previous edition more because it was what I learned with. There is less color and it goes straight to the point. I have only skimmed through this book. Other than that, its a good book to learn about automotive technology.If you really want to learn, go through each chapter throughly and do the review and questions. (and of course, do hands on)"
3,was expecting more,"Seeing how I LOVED the movie, I was expecting a lot from the soundtrack. In the movie, it works just fine, but on CD I wanted music from the movie as well as something else to make it interesting. For example they should have included some timeless movie quotes inside the songs or in between the songs. And I would have liked to see more traditional music of Morocco put forth in the mix to take you into the world of Interzone, instead of in just one or two songs. There is a lot of spooky orchestral work by Howard Shore as well as avant-guard jazz from Ornette Coleman. As time went by, I found myself listening to this a lot more; it works just fine as background music. I have to say my disappointment comes from me having other expectations."
5,Makes AGN interesting...,"This is an excellent book on the topic. Bradley Peterson works in the field and actively seeks to promote understanding of AGN through his book and lectures. The book provides detailed descriptions of what astronomers observe when they examine AGN and then goes on to develop what physics can be gleaned from those observations. The mathematical proofs start off simple enough and then are well-developed to allow for a solid understanding of the physics. This textbook is better up to date than some of its competitors and gives the reader insight as to what the current controversies and unresolved questions are in the field.This text makes AGN accessible to the reader and is presented in a clear way, so that when you are finished, you will be interested to look up papers on the topic!"
2,It is an FPS....,"Graphics 9/10: This game has great graphics but it doesn't use the full power of the Xbox.Gameplay 5/10: If you want a good FPS then just get Halo. If you really want this game get it for PC. If you get it for PC, my friend says you can get third-person for guns and everything. If you get it for Xbox, you can only get 3P mode for the lightsaber.Sound 0/10: You don't really hear much sound except for the gunshots and lightsaber swings.Replay Value 0/10: Their is pretty much nothing to make you play this game again except multiplayer. The multiplayer is pretty boring. BTW I have never gotten the internet to work.Overall 3.5: Gets old after a while."
2,Please rent this game,"before you buy it!!!!!! My bad, after Obi-Wan I ASSUMED that this game would be similar, I should have done more research. The difficulty level of this game is over the top. Trust me on this one, rent this game before you buy it."
1,don't waste your money.. buy Obi wan instead,This is an absolute travesty to the world of star wars gaming.I would suggest that you rent it a local video store first if you don't believe me....
2,JEDI OUTCAST OVER-RATED,"I just rented Jedi Outcast for my son and I to play, and was really disappointed. From the graphics to the way the game played, Jedi Outcast was weak. I am really glad that I rented this game first. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but would not buy this game. I am hoping Knights of The Republic is better."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","I had this game on the PC (decent) and looked forward to the XBox version to utilize my HDTV set and moderately elaborate home theater.This game is disappointing.The graphics are fair.The sound is absolutely terrible. This was the straw that made me return this rental after the 1st day. I wanted to play it, but this was simply too distracting (seriously, I am not nit-picking). There is no panning from front to back, when moving around (expecting the sound to flow from speaker to speaker as it does in many other good games (Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Halo, Fatal Frame...) It is in one speaker and then suddenly chopped off and placed in another. I cannot believe how poorly done the in-game DD5.1 was done.Obviously I enjoy SW and the like, but this game is missing a lot of polish."
2,Subpar,"I won't go into the games other aspects as the other reviewers have done a good job desbribing the story, controls, and overall gameplay. What I will touch on is the AWFUL character animations and overall mediocre graphics. Maybe I'm just jaded from playing Splinter Cell but the characters here are laughable, especially the death animations. The AI is also pathetic. More than once did I have at least 3 to 4 Stormtroopers run from me in terror.Add in the frustrating puzzles plus repetitive music and you have a game that (i found to be) barely playable."
1,Holy crap son.,"This is probably one of the worst star wars games ever made. Its diffucult, you die easily, the first few levels is a shooter game which is not what i bought the game for and you die all the time. Going thru the level is liking blindly trying to follow someone you get a vague idea of where youre suppossed to go but then its a random way of getting there."
3,"Okay for XBOX, Outstanding for PC.","Beaten the PC version, In cloud city for xbox. First, the controls for the PC version blow the XBox controller out of the water. There are also some features on the PC that are sorely missed on the Xbox.(3rd person viewing with the guns for one.) Other than that there both the same game in a way. If you have the choice between playing it on either system. Play the PC version."
3,Mesmerization for an hour,"I expected this game to be so much more fun, because of the lightsabers and different worlds. Little did i know, it wouldn't be so hysterically fun. It's not THAT creative. Also, sometimes it's so hard it takes months to get to a different world. You get tired and will give up TOO easily.The upside: You don't have to just play a mission. Jedi arena allows you to play with others in your household, Jedi against Jedi.Graphics are great on this video game, but other things just make you think, ""And i bought this because?"""
4,Wo,"Ok, this game is fun extremely fun, but miner problemsFist of all the single player mode.Now i love challenging games (in fact i refuse to get games that aren't) but to the extent where you cant even get to the first checkpoint within one hour, thats a little overboard.I mean you've cleared all the enemies in the map in two or less minutes, all thats left is your utterly confusing items and force powers which help you through 5% of the level. After that you have to find these mind killing switches that will open a door leading you to some more mind killing switches, and after about four of those you have actually exited the building. That took about, what?, an hour of my time.Arena-Fun, fun, fun. This is awesome. ONe of the reasons why i got jedi outcast (actually, the only reason.)OveralTHis game is awesome except for the extreme difficulty of this game. Its probobly worth about 35 bucks."
5,Awesome,This chair is everything that it says it is. It is very comfortable and made extremely well. You can't buy a better chair for the money.
1,Bases only no rings,"Description/ picture not accurate, this is ONLY for the base, not the rings. I returned this item (love Amazon for their ease of returns!)."
4,"Solid refutation of most of ""Jesus Seminar""","This book is excellent follow-up to volume one.Tough but readable for the non-theologion. Theauthor is a Roman Catholic scholar, but is not anapolegetic for the Catholic tradition. The endnotes provide good direction for the serious student but are not necessary to follow the main argument. Presents a strong argument against much of the Jesus Seminar publications. My money is hot in my pocket for volume three."
3,Disappointing shelf life,"this is a lovely line of fragrances - each is subtle and appealing. I bought a this scent in june '09 - and unfortunately, by november '09, it has altered and become 'soapy'. so, i think either the shelf-life is nil, or the product was old when i got it. i've never had an oil-based scent turn so quickly.the packaging is adorable - the scent was pleasantly powdery before it went bad. it isn't cheap, so i wish it had lasted."
5,yay!,Arrived in a timely manor with virtually no physical damage to the case and no scratches on the DVDs themselves!
2,be careful when you order,"I ordered this item. When I got it, it was packaged in one of those thin plastic cases instead of the hard case. I think someone sold the $40 version as the $60 version. Wish I'd realized that when I could still return it. Not Happy!"
3,"Not my style, but clever.","I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved them. I don't watch much TV, but I thought this series was clever."
2,Disappointed,"I understood from the listing that there wouldn't be a case for the DVDs, which was fine, but on one of the discs, two of the episodes wouldn't play. :("
5,Wonderful series!,Psych is a fun series. I love the witty dialogue and the references to classic tv and movies. Psych is one of the shows that my family and I end up quoting dialogue from.
3,I love Psych,The product was great! I already have it and need to return it.I need Season 3. I would like the complete set Season 1-6
5,I watch it with the subtitles on...,"because the dialogue comes at me so fast & furious (& funny!) that it helps catch it all. Shawn's lines are frequently *hilarious*.It's a slightly uneven show but very, very, entertaining and light-hearted but not light-weight. The writers sometime steal little things from old shows like Columbo, but it's done more as an homage, IMHO. Good stuff."
4,Hilairous!,I just love Shawn and Gus! There are so many detective tv shows -- they are so common but this one is so different. Those guys know how to make you laugh. The show does tell what is a friendship all about.
5,PSYCH - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON,"A REALLY FUN SHOW, EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY, CANT'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON"
2,Jim Pepper turns over in his grave...,"This has to be the most boring, uncreative electronica I have ever heard. Especially tragic is Tim De Laughter's butchering of the lyrics of the sublime ""Witchi Tai To"": ""War spirit's feet are swinging 'round my head"" instead of ""Water spirit feeling springing 'round my head"". A rather different nuance, is it not? Try listening to Jim Pepper's own recordings instead of Robert Charlebois! (Or better, read Pepper's own transcription of the lyrics.) And, it's hard to believe that ""Kill 100"" was a ""hit""--the English must be getting really desperate! I give this 2 stars rather than only 1 because the booklet graphics are really cute. I will miss them when I ditch this turkey."
5,Mrs. Richter's Cook-Less Book,"Vera Richter, together with her husband, Dr. John Richter, ran the first documented raw food restaurant in America, in Los Angeles, California, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s. Early on, Mrs. Richter wrote her Cook-Less Book, detailing the recipes used in the restaurant.As with most early raw food recipe books, this book does include things like eggs and wheat flour in some of its recipes. Nevertheless, it is a good compendium of early raw food recipes, from the days before food processors and dehydrators.I acquired this book to complete my collection of early raw food recipe books, which includes the Fathmans' Live Foods, Eydie Mae Hunsberger's How I Conquered Cancer and Eydie Mae's Natural Recipes, and John Tobe's No-Cook Book. (if you know of any other early raw recipe books, I'd be grateful if you shared their names with me)"
4,marvel vs capcom2,marvel vs capcom 2 is the best fighting game in 2002 i'm a fan of marvel comics super heroes and street fighter i played it in the arcade and its very fun i hope marvel and capcom bring another sequal capcom should make a street fighter alpha 4 for ps2 also
4,Great? Yes. Perfect? No.,"Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is a great fighting game that gamers got obsessive with it over the last few years. The home console version is great nonetheless,but after a while it gets extremely repetitive and find it too easy. And stupidly enough Capcom produced few copies of the game,making it extremely hard to find(A NIP cost around $70). This is strongely recommended for the fanboys(girls).It is not worth paying more than $60 for this."
4,Better than the first,"Marvel Vs Capcom 2 is 110% better than the PS one orginal. This game has more characters and better graphics. It has many well known characters on both sides(Marvel: Captain America, Wolverine, Iron Man, Spider-Man; Capcom: Ryu, Strider, Zangief and Jill from Resident Evil) plus many characters to unlock. It will keep ya playing for a long time. The last character will also keep you busy for awhile"
5,Excellent except for one thing,It was an awsome Christmas present. Until I put it in my PS2. It would take two or three times for it to start playing the game. I think its because its a blue disk though.
4,A Great Fighting Game To Play,"don't buy this game, wait a few months PS3 & Xbox 360 Owners and you can get it on playstation network (store) and xbox live for $15 this summer. yes people marvel vs capcom 2 is coming to PS3 & Xbox 360 with updated visuals. i had the original game and sold it, my mistake. this is a great game. very fun to play but not worth the outrageous prices the sellers are asking for. to you PS2 and xbox gamers, time to upgrade to a PS3 or Xbox 360, so you can play this fantastic game."
5,HO MY GOD!,HO MY GOD! this game is great! I have the Dreamcast version and is great and now is come to PS2! When its come i will going to buy it!
3,Its not as good is i thought....,well i bought diz game for my son and well after playing with him for a while i saw a few problems with it.....1.The graphics arent so good....2.the sound is bad...and thats about it....the good is....1.greate gameplay fast paced action2.lots of characters to choose from.3.lots of colors....any one dat likes 2d fighting games i reccomend this game for u!!
3,This Game has bug!!,"The background music of the game put me into sleep. The background music doesn't fit this game (I don't know why capcom company used Jazz as background music for a fighting game). Furthermore, the game really disappointed me because it has bug!! For example, The fatal defect is that Chun-Li can't perform ""lighting kick"" in training mode and some stage. Even though I am a fan of this game serie, I only gave this game 3 out of 5."
2,awful ps2 game,"for a ps2 game this game is awful. the graphics are really cheesy, as is the music and how the game works. don't waste your money."
5,Classic game with classic characters,"I love this game for the old arcade feel, the numerous characters, and the cartoonish action which gets me pumped. The classic character designs of characters like Wolverine and Ryu is also cool. If you like old school games and the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise then pick up a copy that you won't find hardly anywhere besides the internet."
4,"Not the best, but pretty damn close to being the best.","This game is an excellent way to kill an afternoon... or lose a lotta sleep, trying to get enough points to unlock all the characters and all the other features.This game is definatly worth forkin' over the money to purchase. The only down side is the music. In a few places, it sounds good, like in the High Score section, but that's just my opinion. However, there are cases when the music will slowly rot away at your soul...As punishment to my friends, I refrain from picking characters so that by the beginning of the match, they can still hear ""Let Me Take You For A Ride"" pounding on their ear drums.But other than the music, get this. Your PS2 will love you for it."
4,"Good Watch, Bad Battery","Our son really likes this watch, with its easy-to-adjust velcro wristband, glow-in-the dark display features, and ""grown-up"" appearance. Within two weeks of receiving it, however, he noticed that it stopped running. Long story short, the watch needed a new battery. We had it repaired locally rather than go through the inconvenience of obtaining postal insurance, shipping it back to the seller, and waiting who-knows-how-long to get it back. Since it's a water-proof watch, there was an extra charge to re-seal the casing after replacing the battery, requiring an additional investment of more than 50% of the watch's original purchase price. I will purchase future watches locally, rather than through the mail, since it would be much simpler to resolve these type of problems."
4,My son loves this watch,"My 12 year old son loves this watch. He finds it very easy to operate. This is the 2nd watch of this kind that I bought. The 1st watch was damaged when my son jumped into the pool with it on. It said it was water resistant, so I told him he could wear it in the pool. I was wrong. The facing was so full of water, you could barely tell what time it was, and the light stopped working. It is a great watch, as long as you don't get it wet."
3,Reasonable,"Just broke today - a little over 1 year of daily wear. Went to a watch repair thinking it was the battery, but it had broken instead. For the price, pretty reasonable for a kid's tough use of 1 solid year."
5,"It keeps going, and going...",Great product. This thing lasts forever and doesn't seem to lose a charge once properly conditioned. Definitely recommend to those E-400/410/420 users who want more life from their batteries.
2,Get What You Pay For,"I really liked the price on this battery, so much cheaper than the brand-name battery. NOW I KNOW WHY! I've not used this batter very often. I only use my camera while on vacation and at special events, so may 4 times, and this is my backup battery. It is already having problems...I fully charged it and it won't turn on my camera. Contacted seller and they said it was beyond their 30-day return policy and there was no warranty. Pay the extra and get a battery with at least a one-year warranty or end up like me and having to buy another battery anyway."
4,"Good for some, bad for others, but BETTER than BYFB?","Disney Sports Football is great for not-so-hot football fanatics, like one, Brad Hunter. This game can be a good challenge, but needs a full swing! Practicing passing and running plays makes the game a slight bit easier, but not much! But, under no circum stances is it better than the Backyard Football Series, tied with BYFB GCN, but worse than BYFB/2002! The Imperials are a good team to use throughout the entire game. This is the first out of 6 games (GBA/GCN types)! I personally believe that there should be more games (Inner Tube Riding (GCN), Hockey (GCN/GBA), Rollerskating (GCN/GBA), Rollerblading (GCN/GBA) )!"
3,A weak football game.,"This game is probably going to sell only because of its Disney license. Outside of that, it feels like football for babies. The tackles seem weak and toned down. Running the ball is way too easy. Passing is almost automatic. There is nothing you really can do while on defense. Kids will like it because it is simple; everyone else should buy Madden 2003. However, if you are looking for a kids' football game, this is better than BACKYARD FOOTBALL."
3,Not recommended for serious competitive play,"While the net itself seems like a good cloth-like quality, looks great, and at first glance the net posts seem strong and durable, I would not recommend this Net Set for serious competitive play.The groove where the net string sits, to allow you to adjust net tension is far too shallow to provide a solid place for the string to sit. This would result in the net string frequently slipping out of the groove, thus ruining your net tension. Not to mention, I was not satisfied with the quality of some of the other components of the set.Overall, for recreational play at home, this net set is not all that bad for the price. Considering a really good set can set you back anywhere from $80-$150. That said, after a little digging I was able to find a much higher quality product at a cheaper price than this one from another online table tennis retailer."
5,Great net - good price,We love this net - very sturdy and durable and was easy to put up. Affordable price - would recommend to any serious table tenis players or any beginners as a great net.
3,"nice posts, lousy net","The killer spin aurora net and post set is a contradiction: good quality posts and poor quality net. The bolt that tightens up against the table is fairly heavy duty, and should last. The net, however, was not very good out of the box; that is, it is somewhat thin and doesn't tighten very well against the posts. We used it at our club for a month, and people started complaining (too many easy net shots), so we bought a different brand (DHS) instead. You are not going to get a quality net under $50 unless you get some super sale. Sadly, sometimes one has to remember you get what you pay for."
3,Good Net,"Good net set but after 6 months the netting has stretched and torn but it has been used a lot. Overall, good for the price."
3,Quick reply,"You can hardly call a film that was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes ""obscure""....Everything else I agree with"
2,BE AWARE,"BE AWARE that you will receive only 1 jar, not 2, if you order this item. The picture showing 2 jars is misleading."
2,subwoofer died on me,"I purchased this sub 2 years ago. It was a very large investment (nearly $500 at the time) for a subwoofer. Approx 2 months ago, it died. Now i'm back to using the old sub that i was using prior to buying this and not really missing this $500 sub as much as I though I would. I don't think I would invest this much in a sub again as the cheaper subs sound reasonable for a mid-fi system."
3,Stick to subwoofer-only manufacturers...,"I listened to one of these the other day at a local shop, it was very disappointing. If you are buying it for movies only then maybe it wouldn't be too bad but for music it is useless---hits low but very muddy and slow, couldn't keep up with the main speakers but often drowned them out instead of blending in smoothly.I liked that it has a range of input connections, but the bottom line is that the sound quality is mediocre to horrible. And to think that this thing originally retailed for half a grand...what a joke!My brother has a Hsu STF-2 and a SVS PB-10, both of which easily blow this thing out of the water for both movies and music. Small wonder, both of those companies make ONLY subwoofers and they sell direct online so you get much better bang for your buck with no middleman retailer adding on his cut."
1,VERY UPSET!,"I was VERY UPSET to look at the musical notes on this and see that it is NOT the song ""Fur Elise"" by Beethoven as the title of the bracelet says! The song ""Fur Elise"" is very special to me, I named my daughter Maya Elise and I wanted to order it for her, but I was very frustrated to see that whoever titled this bracelet knows nothing about music! If you don't care about music, then ignore this review and good luck/enjoy your order."
5,Charming and Delightful Music!!,This movie was brilliant and the soundtrack is even better! The music is so romantic and full of old fashioned quaintness. It has beautiful themes that are not overly done and repeated again and again (like Titanic). George Fenton is a wonderful composer of film music. If you like his music check out the Groundhog Day cd. It is also good.
3,Found Missing Track,"I saw previews for this movie before the title was changed... I believe it was originally called ""The Courtesan"" The preview music I heard was Loreena McKennitt's The Mummers Dance."
4,"Comfortable, cozy, interesting read.","I truly enjoyed this book. It started off a bit slow but very soon picked up and had me hooked. Because it was such a cozy, comforting and interesting read, I used it as my bedtime read. I leave daytime reading to more dangerous authors like Jo Nesbo or Daniel Silva. BUT this book evolved into a daytime book because I wanted to see what would happen next in the high-society world of Lady Edith, her boring, titled husband and her annoying mother-in-law Lady Uckleigh. Such a good story with lots of interesting characters and a little sex (oh boy). Julian Fellows does not disappoint."
3,I wanted it to be better,"Eh. The book is a little tough to get through in places. The plot would stall but then it would pull me back in. While reading, I kept thinking the book was set in the 1920s or earlier and the a modern convenience would be used and I'd remember when the book was set. There was a lot of promise in the book, not all of it fulfilled."
4,Lifts the Veil to See Inside England's Upper Class Lives,"I thought this book would be Brit Chick-Lit with some aristocracy thrown in, but was in for a surprise. It's an analysis of the British upper class and the aspirations of the middle class through the story of Edith Lavery who catches herself an Earl.The adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story. Actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles, but for an American reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary.Much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor, the earl's mother, Edith herself, and a host of other characters.Things get messy when Edith finds life in a stately home a crashing bore. Intrigued by a handsome actor, she contemplates chucking the prestigious marriage that she worked so hard to achieve."
4,An accurate portrayal of the English upper class,This books so accurately portrays the English class system that is still prevalent. People may claim that it is a thing of the past but these people really do exist. Fellowes cleverly captures this anacronyistic world poking fun at the characters but still with some fondness.
4,"Good, witty, and fun read","As a big fan of Gosford Park I was absolutely thrilled when I heard that its award-winning screenwriter had released a novel. And what joy! 'Snobs' has all of the wit, honesty, and intrigue of Gosford Park without feeling at all like a retread. It is about Edith, a socially ambitious woman who marries into wealth and privilege; however, once she has achieved her dream she becomes restless and hopelessly bored with the life she has chosen. Her life spins into scandal and, possibly, redemption as Fellowes uncovers just how shallow our ambitions can be. The true success of 'Snobs' is that it doesn't feel critical of human nature, just honest. Fellowes' prose is a joy to read, being both light and humorous. I would highly recommend this book."
5,Replay and delightful,"Jullian Fellowes gives us The Razor's Edge, by W. Somerset Maugham, without the spiritual element of India. Why can no one remember?As a groupie of Gosford Park, I appreciate Snobs---enjoyed and loved the surpise twists and the exqusite landng. I wish there were sequels..."
1,Snooze fest,"I am glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I am also glad it was short so I didn't have to suffer through more than 265 pages.The nameless first person narrative is not a literary device I enjoy. So that took away from the novel for me.Also, it was just DULL. Plus, I saw the ending come from a mile away. I did not sympathize with Edith at all and - spoiler here---I thought that for her to foist another man's child onto Charles was despicable. Charles was a sap and should have kicked her to the curb."
3,Probably for Anglophiles only,"This book is all about the British social classes. The author was the screenwriter for the film Gosford Park, so if that movie wasn't your ""cup of tea,"" this won't be either. Not bad, just not great either."
5,Snobs was excellent1,It was beautifully written. Some of the passages in the book were priceless! I couldn't put it down. Would definitely recommend this book.
3,Snobs,A little dense-Hard to follow patterns of speech.Feel the need to constantly re-read passagesto sort out what the author is talking about.
4,Good fast read.,Easy to enjoy and makes it all seem realistic!! Great to have something that is exactly what it is supposed to be
4,mitfoford,quite reminscent of the works of nancy mitford also available from amazon areally enjoyable read l ask myself if things have changed so much if we are really honest with our selves & scratch bellow the surface hard thing to do
5,"A contemporary read, with an old fashioned feel","I enjoyed this gossipy read about the old-fashioned aristocracy still gamboling about in today's world. The characters were knowable, even on this side of the Atlantic. Granted, I do have a bit of an affinity toward the Brits and maybe you should too, to read this book? I don't know.I loved the manipulations and machinations of the power-mad and power-had. The narrator skirts the lines between two worlds and has no animosity towards either, just allows the reader to get acquainted with the world from his vantage point.Loved the book and love an author who doesn't feel he has to write down to his audience."
2,Disappointing.,This book was not what I expected which may explain my rating. I gave it away. The book does not delve into the details of mathematicians as anticipated.
5,The perfect windchime sound,"Everyone who sits on my deck or passes my yard comments on this attractive windchime and the soothing sounds it makes. It's not that tinkly sound most chimes make, but the deeper tone of tapping hollow bamboo sticks together. It has faded a little from the elements (spring and summer in Michigan) but it's still structurally sound and looks great. I plan to pack it up for fall and winter and I'm sure it will be just fine when it goes back up next spring."
4,Wow! This one was DIFFERENT!,"It was as if the author was living a dream, or should I say a nightmare. The emotions came through. The irony, the black humor, the just plain silliness of life by the numbers. I surely didn't 'get' every subtle reference, parable or dream-scape, but I think I got the point or should I say pointlessness of it all.This is a quick read. Enjoyed it. It ends with a more academic analysis of Vietnam War FAQ's answered with considerable insight from a boots on the ground perspective (and without wild imaginative prose in the rest of the book.)"
1,good bye,Realy a very weird book. It had almost nothing to do with the war. I could not understand where he was coming from. I quit half way through so maybe it got better.
5,Tons of new stuff!,"I'm not sure what book this guy from Orange, CA was reading, but I found all kinds of new and relevant information in several chapters! The chapter on Terminal Services was especially enlightening. Many new things to consider when rolling this one out to the enterprise! Yikes.I think the reader from Orange missed the whole point of the book. It wasn't intended to be a catalog of the latest and greatest tools on the market - like the Hacking Exposed series - it looks like it was designed to help internal security staffs think differently about how they secure the critical components of the enterprise. This includes how they write their policies, and consider the human factor in the security equation.I have personally used the book's content to create focused audit programs and been very successful at doing so.Please create more books in this series!"
3,its okkkk,"WHEN I BUY THIS CD,I EXPECTED THE MELODIC HYPOCRISY BUT I FOUND THAT THIS ONE WAS NOT THAT MELODIC.SINCERELY I DONT LIKE HYPOCRISY SOUND SO HEAVY, FOR ME I LIKED MORE MELODIC. BUT STILL IS A OKA CDGIAN"
4,The best since 1993's Osculum Obscenum,"Hypocrisy is not your typical death metal band. In some ways they are great, having given us some great ""Swedish"" Death Metal, and over the years, they have given us some stinkers, such as the horrid ""Abducted"" or some of the drab ""Ballads"" (wtf??) they have done. One masterpiece they did, was 1993's Osculum Obscenum. Hardly any filler, no ballads or ""experimental"" songs, just plain, in your face Death Metal. ""Into the Abyss"" is another great album. Out of ten tracks, I liked Seven of them, and the seven were all killer cuts. I understand that some like the ""experimental"" Hypocrisy, but to me, some if it is very repetive, almost to the point where it gets on my nerves. If you dont have ""Osculum Obscenum"" then pick this up. Its a great effort and a pleasure to hear another ""Death"" metal album If you want another great effort that is more on the experimental side, then try 2002'2 ""Catch 22"" Its strays away from their death metal roots, but it is a solid album."
3,More experimental than I particularly care for,"Still, it's mostly quite listenable. On some tracks, there's even the novelty of a ""beat"". I shouldn't curse this with an experimental label, given that anyone who should actually seek this title must dance to television static. All the trademark electronic noises are here, intricately and in some cases pleasantly assembled. There's nothing really exciting, though. For all one may care, every track might have been done by the same artist. All in all, a fairly good deal for two discs (though I only bought it 'cause it was cheap), but beware these knob twisters and their unorthodox music!"
3,Wish it was better made.,"We bought this for my 4 year old son when he was in his lightning mcqueen phase. It was fairly easy to blow up and worked well for him since the sides came up and he couldnt roll out. YOU WILL NEED A CRIB MATTRESS FOR THIS BED. We bought it under the assumption that you wouldnt. Anyways, my son loved it. It got him out of mommy and daddys bed and into his own. However, within 2 weeks it popped and we couldnt patch it. Since he loved it so much I thought maybe it was just wear and tear and we purchased a new one. About a month later the same thing happened. After that we just bought a big boy bed. Although the idea is nice and it makes for cute decoration it's not durable. So therefore not worth the money."
4,A fun Nascar game that manages to nad second place.,"NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a fun game, but it is not up to the standards set by Nascar Thunder 2003. You take a car from dirt races up to the Daytona 500, and you will have a lot of fun doing so. The graphical engine is simply awesome, and control is great. however, crashes are not as good, and sometimes races can feel like bumper cars. But still, NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is incredibly fun, thanks to good control and an incredibly unique career mode. This product is definetely a must-buy, but you might want to pick up Nascar Thunder 2003 first."
4,Simply the best physics in any console title to date,"Unlock the realistic physics bonus (it takes some commitment), and you're good to go. What you find lacking from games like the Gran Turismo series is actually represented here: losing traction in turns, losing balance during braking, independently-locked wheels, peeling out, internal and external damage, etc. The Gamecube's controller is wonderful for this game, if you don't have a wheel. This is the way you imagined the analog triggers going to work as throttle & brake, with button shifting (although there are other schemes too, if you'd prefer). Quite impressive. This title just misses out on a little polish - not all tracks are playable in every mode, and with just three road courses, the great physics model is sadly underutilized. NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona is a hidden gem, that won't be given its due in video game or racing sim history."
2,Too Fragile,"I purchased 5 of these sets to get enough 1"" gauges to evaluate my lawn irrigation system. It would have been nice to be able to buy them alone instead of having to buy an equal number of 5"" units. This is especially true for those of us in SoCal where everything green is on life support!The 1"" gauges are so fragile that it was all but impossible to insert them deep enough to get a valid measurement. Contact one pebble on the way in and the brittle 02 thin plastic cracks. 2 more were almost immediately demolished by my small dog tripping over them.I guess that I can give the superfluous 5"" gauges as stocking stuffers this Xmas to my friends who live where it actually rains. They can be post mounted and might survive for awhile.So if you live somewhere where you have 3"" of totally rock free friable topsoil, you might find the little guys useful!"
5,Inexpensive rain gauge!,"It measures rain, and water from the hose or sprinkler. Fairly easy to read. Easy to insert into (soft) ground. Inexpensive."
4,"Does what it should, more or less","Works fine. Just note that the bigger gauge has no spike so needs to be attached to a fence or railing. The smaller gauge is fine for measuring sprinkler output but keep in mind that, because it's so shallow, the water in it evaporates quickly so you need to go check the water level right after watering. Still, for this price there's hardly reason to complain."
3,Almost like new,"I was pleased when the product arrived so quickly. Then I opened the package and found a crack in the upper plastic housing. Disappointed, I applied some ""crazy glue"" and now I have the product in use. I didn't think I should bother trying to return it, since the postage cost more than the product itself.It is a nice item but very fragile!!"
3,Timex Rain Gauge,It's okay. I didn't read the instructions well enough to know that it was two sprinklers in one and that the largest part was to be put on a fence. We have no fence so we put it inside the smaller part and stuck it in the ground. I did like the way the bright color showed up in the yard.
3,Beware of cold temperatures,"We have had 3 of these rain gauges over the past 10 years. It is easy to use and gives a ballpark estimate of rain, although the measurement is always greater than the ""official rainfall amount"" given on the weather forecast. Just be sure that you bring it in during the winter if you live where it freezes. All 3 of our rain gauges suffered the same fate. It rained, the water froze in the gauge, and the gauge cracked and was rendered useless."
1,Received broken time clock from Ace Photo Digital,"The title pretty much says it all. This might be a good time clock, but I wouldn't know because the one I ordered from Ace Photo Digital was broken. I chose to send it back for a full refund instead of dealing with the hassle of repairs."
1,Awful experience,"I installed this in my office and half the time the machine doesn't read the cards. The dial also is not great at getting the card aligned right. The manual dial is also another nuisance that had made me waste a lot of hours tracking overlapping prints. Stay away from this product, in my opinion it is worth spending an extra $40 for any other product."
2,Horrible Customer Service,"The time clock only prints the top half of each number. Each week I have to try to distinguish 2's from 3's etc. Have been trying to get a replacement for it for 3 weeks now. No one will help me. I've called atleast 5 different phone numbers, each party shifting the responsibility to another party where you will likely get a recording or be put on hold forever, just to find out that you really need to call some other department. Finally got a hold of the person in charge of the time clock returns at Royal and she said to email her the info and she'd send me out a replacement. That was 8 days and 2 emails ago. She has yet to respond to my emails. I was also informed that there would be NO REFUNDS, just replacement. I would love to go down to Staples or Office Max and buy a new one while I spend months trying to get my money back, but that's not gonna happen."
2,Time Clock,The time clock didn't work when we received it.It has been returned for repair. So I have no other info until itreturns from the factory
5,"Works Well, Expensive on this Website","This time clock fits all my needs. Since it is top loading, my employees do not have to worry about missing the designated spot on the time card. Also, only one person in the morning really needs to turn the knob, for the rest who come in after, they just need to put it in and it automatically punches the time on. No button pushing necessary!I do recommend buying this item from acedepot[dot]com because they have this item for $99+shipping for refurbished and $125+shipping for new. Much cheaper than any of the sellers on here, even the themselves on the refurbished page. I guess it is because of Amazon's fees."
1,Terrible QC for this Time Clock,"We have had two of these units over the years in an office with 5 or 6 people who punch a clock. Last unit died, ordered a new one that was DOA. Sent it back, tried for a refurb unit from same seller, figured it would be fixed this time. Nope, DOA again. Issue is my controller really likes this unit so hopefully the 3rd time is the charm!"
1,Don't buy it or you'll be sorry...,"I bought it a few months ago. After 3 months, it dies.Every time it print out something, it makes a lot of noise.Sound like a type-writer. No wonder it screwed up so soon.After dying, every time I plug it to the outlet,it makes some kind of noise like the sound of a cat, gr...gr.Save your money to buy a better different model."
2,Too noisy,"We returned this time clock. It was too outdated and archaic. The worse thing was it clunked loudly once every minute. Very annoying in a small office. We could hear it even after putting it in the adjoining small room with the door closed. Much too mechanical. It should be advertised as a ""Retro"" time clock."
2,NOT the Superbowls UNCUT. Only contains synopsis of games!,"I was really hoping this would contain uncut footage of the games themselves. Unfortunatley, this is a collection of previously aired NFL Films footage from each year. While they are fun to watch, these short films do not really contain any critical insights into any particular team. Steve Sabol and the rest of the NFL Films crew do a good job mining particular nuggets of footage (neat angles and the like) but that's about as far as it goes.If you are a fan of NFL Films then you'll probably enjoy these; but if you are looking for the games themselves, complete and uncut, you'd better look elsewhere."
2,Poor Quality Motion Detector,Motion Detector Alarm was advertised as having a sensitvity of 7.0 meters distance. Actual sensitivity is more like 1.0 meter and that is only sometimes. I would send it back for a refund but I would still be out $38.00 after paying mailing cost again so I guess they got me this time.
5,funny stories by children,I remember reading this in the 60's. it was a review of several essays written by children and thought it was really funny at the time. Would like to read it again.
4,From zack the king of reviews,"OK this game has alright graphics compared to my other games [halo, james bond nightfire, and terminator] but I really miss out on having no storyline. When you start you just go pick a team and start battling. You have to win in order to get points and it is really lame what you can buy with 400 points, I mean who cares whether your charachter gets a new color! And in order to buy new charachters that are worth using points on you have to win a lot. Like you can get about 4 or 500 points for getting to level four, an the good charachters cost 2300 points. so before you buy the game you might want to get halo or terminator oh yeah and if you get the game keep the recipt!!!"
3,Too good but too late,"Your probably asking why I'm reviewing so freakin early but Marvel vs. Capcom 2 was going to be the reason for me to own Xbox but it seemed it was never comin out. Now because of that I got it for PS2 and made my right choice and I'm staying with it. My PS2 homies can chill and play this right now while you Bill gates fanboys have to wait for 2 more months. Xbox SUX,PS2 rulz"
4,"Fun game, but be patient!","Marvel vs Capcom 2 for Xbox is a great game, but be patient. It takes a while to unlock all of the characters, and it also a pretty rare game. If you can find it for under $50, BUY IT!!! I bought mine for $36 pre-owned. (since they stopped making this game, everyone is buying it and selling it for bogus amounts!!)"
4,"Must Have Fighting Game for Fighting, Capcom, and Marvel fan","This is a great game to own. I loved the gameplay and the addictiveness due to unlocking characters and just the game itself. But it started to get kinda repetitive after a week or two. Many of the characters were just clones of one another (Ryu, Dan, Ken, Akuma). There aren't many different modes or things to do, in fact I just spent most of my time playing arcade mode. But aside from that, I like this game. If you are a Street Fighter fan this game contains many of the more popular street fighters and has all of the characters from the first marvel vs capcom. If you are a Marvel fan, this game gives great moves to spiderman and includes many of the X-men (but most importantly CABLE). I think this is a fun game to play with your friends or at a party, but if you want a game that lasts, I suggest you look into another video game."
3,Get it at 1/3 Price on XBL!!!,"MvC2 is my favorite 2D fighter of all time! I owned the game on Dreamcast, PS2, and this version on XBOX. The XBOX version is the worst of the 3 with serious slowdown and the controls don't feel as natural. The good news is I just dowloaded the XBOX Live Arcade version for 1200 points [...] do not buy this game it is way cheaper to just download!"
2,marvel vs capcom 2,game loses it's fun real fast when playing the computer. why couldn't it be live.
1,"Pretty pics, but that's about all","Don't bother buying this book unless the intended recipient is a novice at container-gardening. As a reference book, it falls way short. For example, the ""bulbs"" chapter lists just 11 selections, ""shrubs"" 17, few with pictures. (The ""pretty pics"" in my title refer to photos of finished gardens and patios. Nice, but you can find that in any old shelter magazine.) In fact, there are dozens if not hundreds of plants that will grow happily in containers...if you give them the right conditions. The prose, too, reminds me of a magazine: cheerful and generic. This pretty book might encourage someone to try container gardening, but they'd sure want a more practical guide before long."
4,Memory lane,It was a gift for my wife and she enjoyed very much. It brought back fond memories of the show.
4,What Great Memories...,The Adventures of Spin & Marty brought back great memories. I would run home from school daily to watch everyday. I consider these to be the first Soaps kid style. My big disappointment was that was that there are no more. I wanted to purchase the continued series with Annette. But so far no luck for the continuing saga. There are many more...and after watching the first group of cd's I want more...hopefully they will offer more...to the fans!
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"What a tremendous collection. I watched this with my family and we were absolutely enthralled with the adventures of Spin & Marty. I'm a huge Disney fan, and especially appreciate The Mickey Mouse Club and the various television and movie productions from the 50s into the 70s. Watching this gives us a chance to look back at a time when life was a bit simpler. We completely enjoyed this Walt Disney Treasures collection."
2,"Hardly acceptable for voice, never think about music","I bought this product a year ago. It is small, very easy to use, and easy to operate and share data with pc. But if the subject s the quality of the recordings, stop for a second and think last one more time. It is not too bad for voice recording but don't think about using this small toy for recording variable sound like music."
2,ADDICTING!!! But....,"...the novelty wears off. The fact that the movie making experience is very limited, redundant, and totally lacking. The stratagy part of it together with the ""fun"" and creative parts of the game is completely off-putting. But it's a fun game for the first 5-10 hours of play.If you enjoy sim games, try and get it on sale or borrow from a friend. If you don't but this game sounds intreging, then think twice about this purchase."
3,Its a great game for those who like tycoon games,"First off, let me say this. This game is not new at all. If you have a new computer, the auto-run feature won't work. Instead you are going to have to install it manually. Now, about the game. Game play is similar to the sims or Cruise Tycoon. You create or choose an actor, make a script, and shoot the movie. It says you can create your own movies. Well, not exactly. You choose a pre-made backdrop, choose the year, and write the script. All the actions though, are already made. You just choose the action and they perform it. But, in my opinion the animations are really lame and not realistic at all though. But overall it is a pretty good game, if you like tycoon games. However, if you want it for the video maker and editor, it is pretty basic. Also, customer support on this product no longer exists. So if you have problems you are probably out of luck."
3,Okay but I got bored with it quick,"It's like The Sims, yet not. It didn't hold my attention like The Sims games do. Not knowing how to do certain things, not knowing which people have which skills (and from a distance, it's hard to tell who's who), not knowing who should go where and when, and them needing stuff while I'm trying to build something without knowing all the necessities for that type of building... well, it just left me want an update and more info and help."
3,"Fun, Creative , and Sometimes Frustrating","I enjoyed the game overall, however, the ""movie-making"" feature of the game which I was most excited about ending up being the most disappointing part. However, controlling the studio is fun, developing characters reminds me of my Sims days, and overall this game is good as long as you've got the time and the patience to develop your studio."
1,False Advertising: Incomplete and Highly Buggy,"BEWARE: Save your money and do not buy this game. The advertising is false: you can NOT make your own movies the way you like. There is no free camera movement; you can only select actors' actions from a limited group of pre-made fixed scenes; the developer is actively trying to prevent modding and add-ons from being made by the gaming public. The online community is horrendous; it is flooded with juvenile delinquents and the developer runs the website like a Stalinist work camp. The game itself is highly buggy and will crash to desktop or lock-up frequently. The audio portions of any ""movie"" cannot be kept in sync with the video and no patches appear planned for these problems."
1,Not a handy item.,I have had several algae scrapers through the years and this is far and away the worst. What makes or brakes these scrapers is the head that holds the straight blade. This scraper does not properly hold the blade which results in the blade often times getting covered or so loose that you can't scrape anything but the very thinnest of films off of your tank. If you are thinking of buying a scraper..... buy a different one.
4,Nice for table,We bought this mainly it goes with our Sango everyday dishes. Keep things warm on the table. Great for mashed potaoes.
4,I enjoyed this movie,"I enjoyed this movie, mainly because I like Armin Mueller-Stahl. This is the first movie that he's played in that is in the German language, and I thoroughly enjoyed his performance."
5,Dog Food's Unleashed--One of the years best unknown albums,"Dog Food's first release, Unleashed, is simply amazing. With provacative hooks and superior lyrics, the whole cd pulls you into the life of Keith Vukan. I myself have been listening to Dog Food for about 7 years and I've been entranced entirely for each of those years. Not a day goes by when I don't sing a lyric or push the album onto my friends. And many people agree, Dog Food will be the next great *influential* band of the new millenium. With so many different sounds from the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles to Charlie Christian and Marc Antoine, Dog Food is sure to please any fan of music. Buy the cd and find out for yourself why Dog Food is.. simply amazing.."
4,Are you hooked yet?,"Susan Juby lives up to all expectations with ""Realist at Last"". Though it's not quite as hilarious as her first two novels, it is still enjoyable. Alice (the mail character) has decided to be a screen writer now and so throughout the book you get to read her screenplay ""Of Moose and Men"". In which she overemphasizes the ""hardships"" she must go through, including the fact that her mother is currently in jail for a ""good cause"" as Alice's new therapist likes to make sure. Goose has also moved away, sadly for Alice, freeing her up to date other men, all of whom turn out to be older or younger or just not right. But, of course, if you've read ""Alice, I think"" and ""Miss Smithers"" you're already hooked and didn't need my review, so, happy reading..."
2,Medium At Best,"Jimmy Fallon is an excellent impersonator, as seen in the Troll Doll skits, but unfortunately the cd was dissapointing. Save yourself the money and download the troll songs and hammertime. Fallon's a great comedian, but he needs to work on his material before making his next release."
4,Funny stuff!,"There are 7 songs on this CD and they are all (except one) great. Listen to them whenever you need a happiness boost or when you're really hyper. Every one of the seven songs are easy to sing along too. The other half of the CD is Jimmy's stand-up acts. I didn't find them too funny. You certainly can't listen to those more than a few times. Even though I think only half of the CD is good, the kick you get from that good half makes it all worthwhile."
3,Could have been a lot better...,"OK, I admit it, I'm a 16 year old girl that adores Jimmy Fallon and thinks he is the hottest guy ever. EVER. And he's very talented too, especially with his impressions (On this album's ""Troll Doll Jingles""). But The Bathroom Wall is a few good ideas with a lot of filler. There are a few funny tracks (I liked Idiot Boyfriend and Snowball), but if you're iffy about the guy, I wouldn't recommend it at all. For true Jimmy fans, it is a must, of course, but just don't expect to not be disappointed. There could have been a lot more effort put into it."
4,a good buy,"i just picked up jimmy fallon's 'bathroom wall' yesterday..the reason i bought this cd was because of 'idiot boyfriend', which is a hilarious song..(i can't play) basketball, road rage, and snowball are great songs too...his stand ups like troll doll celebrities, chris rock was my ra, troll doll jingles, and hammertime are funny..the other ones are okay...overall a good buy.."
1,Ewww!!!,"If you love Jimmy Fallon on SNL (which I do,) and do not like heavy metal (hard rock) then DO NOT waste your precious time on this earth listening to even the samples of this CD. I even love rap but this music gave me a headache! Hilary Duff is an actor and a singer and I love her music,but Jimmy should just quit trying to get popularity. Oh, and whats the deal with the song, ""Idiot Boyfriend"", did Jimmy turn into a girl or something? This is a horrible product."
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed listening to Jimmy Fallon...His cd is Great!But i have to admitt, after the first month...it got irritating!! You can only listen to it for a while until you wanna pull your hair out!! But besides that it was Good!!"
4,good cd.,"this cd is very funny, especially when youre stoned out of your mind. jimmy fallon has alot of talent on snl and off, and it shows here. his song parodies are HILARIOUS, and his stand-up aint too shabby either."
3,Funny the first time,"This is a great listen and very quotable, but I haven't listened to it at all over te past year."
4,A comedy CD you can actually listen to over and over,"Unlike most stand up, which is only funny the first time you hear it, Fallon's CD is funny over and over because of the songs. Every time I listen to them I pick up more and more of the ""under his breath"" or ""too speedy to catch the first time"" jokes. The songs are the best part of the CD, I'd rate the stand-up tracks as just average and not as re-listen-able."
4,Good game but the plot is a little slow in the beginning.,"Overall, this is a fairly good RPG. The plot is a little slow but picks up in the later chapters. Not quite as good as the previous 2 suikoden games. I dont really recommned this game if you played the previous 2 games since it is a little repetitive but I highly recommned this game if you havnt played the other 2 games."
1,Suikoden 3- The worst RPG of the Suikoden Series,"After playing the two best RPG's on the PSX console, I was excited to see Suikoden 3 come out on PS2. I was angry that they made the graphics look too nice. Suikoden was known for its classic RPG graphics, and I loved them more than the PS2 graphics.This game's plot is very weak and stupid. First of all, you have to follow the story through three different people's lives. If you don't do this in order (no true order is actually specified in the game) then it gets really confusing. You don't understand the plot until you go through everyon's character.This game is so bad, that I dont even consider it a Suikoden. This game is so horrible, that I haven't heard Konami talking about a Suikoden 4. If it is anything like 3, I hope they don't. Go buy Suikoden 1 and 2"
1,I am so tired of this!!,"Common sense to me in making a good video game sequal,would be sticking to what made the previous installment/s great...NOPE! That ain't gonna happen in this age! For some reason game developers are almost sadisticaly compelled to add ""new"" stuff and completely throw away the tried and true elements that veterans of a series have come to know and love.Suikoden 3 is the fourth RPG that I have played for the PS2 which originated on an older system.And like the other three(Wild Arms 3,Legend Of Legia 2 and Final Fantasy X)it [bites] because they change way too much;almost to the point of feeling like an entirely diffrent game instead of a sequal.I hate to say it,but I think the death of good rpgs is upon us.Fun and traditonal gameplay is being replaced with eye candy and foreign concepts.I'd rather play good ol' dragon warrior on the 8bit nintendo than these peices of junk!I STRONGLY advise lovers of the first two installments of suikoden to rent this game before buying it."
3,Just doesn't work as a Game,"Although the story to this game is awesome, I had to push through the annoying aspect of no real main charater for the first half of the game. A very tedious combat system. And finally the never ending annoyiance of running to and from CONSTANTLY. It took me forever to beat the game cause I had to force my self to play a horrible game in order to enjoy a good story. I loved suikoden 1 and 2 I thought this made for a poor excuse for a suikoden game."
5,simply perfect,"This game is great. I spent such a long time making my castle and recruting all of the 108 stars in the game. It is very addicting, you buy this and you'll be pulling all nighters because of this PERFECT game. Buy this game and you won't be dissapointed at all. I personally think it's more entertaing than Final Fantasy 10 and Kingdon Hearts. They both are great games, but this is much better."
2,suikoden 3 letdown,I am sorry. I just bought this game and have been playing it for a week and have come to the following conclusion that it is not all it appears to be. The first two games in the series were awsome but this game has none of the things that made those games great. The game is totally linear with almost no freedom to explore and the 3d graphics do nothing to enhance the game and any similarity to the first two of the series seems to be put in as an afterthought. They attempt to make this a more plot filled game but the plot is unispired. The trilogy system just means you have to go through the same boring plot over and over again with different characters. I looked forward to this game so much and am hugely disappointed. Don't wast your money on this game. Rent it first and you can make your own decision.
2,Where's the plot?,"Having played RPGs for a number of years with pencil and paper, I found this game to be very weak. I expect an RPG to have a plot and a story to tell, this is what Role Playing Games are all about. Suidoken III's start is slow and reminiscent of Nintendo's style of RPG's which involve a lot of wandering around, hacking and slashing, with little plot to back up all of this wandering. The lack of voice overs for cut scenes also made the game a real eye sore after an hour of play.If you want a game with a real plot, buy Xenosaga. If you just want to beat things up, then this game is for you."
4,key elements missing,i am a big fan of the suikoden series so naturally i bought the third one and i never thought i would ever write a bad review...and i really really hate to say this but i am dissappointed. They took out the old game engine that everyone loved to make it 3-d. they had their heart in the right place but you have no control over the camera making it a little hard to navigate. the battle system has also changed and is a little awkward but i know true fans will get over this as i have. while the trinity system is neat it is just almost as if it isn't suikoden anymore...but the on the up side the artwork is still as great as it ever was and the cut scenes are way better than the previous games...if you are a true fan dont miss this game but if you are new to suikoden try the first two before judging the whole series on this one.
2,If it didn't have a good story this game would suck really bad.,"I'm about 40 hours in to the game. Graphics are HORRIBLE, you have to read ALL the dialog, there is no dubbing of any kind...The areas you explore are linear.....a 5 year old could navigate these areas. Whoever developed the maps should get fired. The story is excellent, but they make you go through it 3 times! Gets boring. This is one of those games that I had to put down and come back to out of boredom. I would not reccamend this game to anybody..."
3,A gamer,"At first, I was totally disappointed with the new game in the series. I didn't like the trinity system, the new battle system, the new 3D look, and it sort of reminded me of Final Fantasy X, a game I hated. In other words, it was like a completely different game, instead of a game continuing the famous Suikoden series (which I must say is my favorite series of all time).In my opinion, this game is more for people who have not played the first two and are looking for the traditional Suikoden style.Even though I was expecting more of the same old stuff, Suikoden III still happens to be a good game. If you love RPG's and are looking for a unique and awesome war story, this is the game for you."
3,A big step down from Suikoden 2,"Although Suikoden 3 is still a fairly good RPG, it pales in comparison to Suikoden 2. In place of updated graphics also comes increased time for screen loads. The story is not nearly as strong as Suikoden 2, and the music is overall unimpressive and uninspiring.Additionally, I found the switching between 3 characters to be somewhat tedious, because it continuously interrupted story lines and broke the continuity that you were able to develop with the storyline and characters of the first two Suikoden games."
4,eh,"I could not handle this game. I love role playing games, as opposed to shoot-em-up games, but this was way too boring. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, and hated the battle style, you just sit and wait! AH! I could not get past the beginning part to even get to the more exciting stuff. I could not sit through it, the pace drove me crazy. It may be cheesier, but I prefer Gauntlet over this game any day!"
4,Oster Blend-N-Go Cup,I like the item. Its very nice not to have to clean the whole blender when I want to make a smoothie. The only problem is that you cant add any items once you start blending the smoothie. You have to put all the items in from the start. Otherwise I have had no problems with the Oster Blend-n-Go cup and i highly recomend it!
5,Perfect for Protein Shakes,"If you work out, or know someone who does this is the perfect cup to get.I got this for my boyfriend,he drinks protein shakes everyday. He hates washing the big blender jug. So this was perfect, all you do is put protein mix and whatever liquid you use put the blender peice(you must have your own blender) and flip it upside down and blend.Its perfect for people who take protein shakes on the go to the gym, and dishwasher safe.I got one for myself, for smoothies in the summer time."
4,just fantastic,"after a long time i heard one of my favorite groups and boy was I glad? it was simply fantastic and refreshing to hear beckley's serene and gentle voice on songs that were so captivating and hummable, it sure was a treat listening to this album with great songs. after getting this one i am surely intrigued by beckley's earlier album should try & get hold of it"
4,Great Songwriter,"Gerry Beckley has consistently shown that he can produce intelligent and enjoyable pop/rock music. This new set of tunes features an all star supporting cast of back up musicians that round things out nicely. Rusty Young of Poco fame lends his pedal steel and other skills to 'Arms' and my favorite drummer of all time, Russ Kunkel is featured on 'Love & Leaving'. The only thing I miss on Gerry's solo stuff is Dewey Bunnell. I love Gerry's unique voice, but I prefer the America stuff where the disc is broken up by songs in Dewey's lower register. A whole disc of Gerry is too much of a good thing for me sometimes. This probably comes from years of saturated America listening! I keep waiting for the 'Dewey' song to come on to break things up. Anyway, you can't go wrong with this CD if you are a fan of America and Gerry's great songwriting."
5,Outstanding Release!,"Have been a fan since the initial releases, Homecoming was the anthem of my generation. Though recent efforts Human Nature, BLW and Van Go Gan had some great cuts, Horizontal Fall is first rate from start to finish. Most of the album follows the ""less is more"" production which showcases Gerry's wonderful vocals. Harmonies are better than anything he's previously done solo or with America. You can hear the later influences of Jeffrey Foskett/Jeff Larson/Hank Linderman in this production. Compositionally, Gerry has matured such that there are NO lame cuts on the album. Saturday Sky is remeniscent of a George Harrision ballad, with improved vocals. Overall, the melodic feel reminds one of Paul McCartney, but with the America stylings we've come to love over the past 33 years. Congratulations to GB on an outstanding album. Can't wait for the next release."
4,Beckley at his best,"I have listened to this for a few months now, and I've added it to my permanent playlist.The overall feel of the music and the quality of the songs is very high.Beckley at his best (""Clarice"", ""Here"", ""Till The Sun Comes Up Again"") establishes a reflective, dreamy, and somewhat melancholy mood, and that is the case here. Instrumentation is perhaps a bit more spare than on his America songs, but he uses horns in some songs to nice effect. The beginning and end of ""Somewhere, Somehow"" reminds me of Bacharach. ""Here and Now"", ""Warm Gone Gray"", ""I'll Be Gone"", ""Arms"" are quite lovely, deceptively simple love songs. ""Crying"" and ""Saturday Sky"" are uptempo pop songs.Being Beckley, the songs are all quite melodic, and for the most part avoids the occasional ""icky sweet"" lyricism of his lesser songs. Considering how far past 1972 (and the debut America album) Beckley is, this is a surprisingly beautiful, and welcome song cycle."
3,Pretty good cd,"On his 2006 cd there our some good songs but I like the song style he does with America better. When he,s with his band America the songs are excellent for exsample there Here & Now cd with new songs on it were excellent as awesome as there older songs. Id pass on this cd."
1,I was duped,"Everyone raved about this album.I really like his voice and music with America, but this is by far the worst cd I've ever bought.Even the packaging was cheap and boring."
1,Don't waste your money,"First off let me say that I have most of America's studio albums and I thought Beckley's Van Go Gan was a fine solo effort...but this CD is very poor. The songs are lackluster and without any hooks to draw you in. America has never been known for having thought-provoking lyrics but the words in HF are just plain sappy. And to finish off this sickeningly sweet album are the album graphics. The front cover looks like an amusement park in the distance at night and on the inside is a picture of Beckley's dad sitting next to an airplane? There may be some vague reference to these ""themes"" in a song but I couldn't find them.To be short; just about any of America's previous work, except their latest release, or Beckley's fist solo effort far surpass HF. This release is quite disappointing. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Gerry Beckley. When I made a compilation CD of my favorite America songs, almost all were his, with a few of Dan Peek's and only one or two of Dewey Bunnell's. I also loved Van Go Gan. This album, however, doesn't have the catchy melodies that has made me such a fan of Gerry. I wanted to like it, but found it quite boring and will likely not listen to it much."

2,Didn't work for me.....waste of money!!,"Last year I was taking the regular Isatori L7 so I figured why not try the maximum strength. Well after a month of having a racing heart rate I've decided not to reorder these products! The only thing different in my opinion is the extra caffiene they throw in to make ""max"" I suppose. With the regular L7 I was never hungry, that I could remember. However, with the Max, I'm always hungry and haven't lost a thing, I think I actually gained a pound or two."
2,Not strong enough,"This product did not touch my appetite at all. I am preparing for my first figure competition. I was attracted by the reviews and a friend who is a bodybuilder told me it was the best for the price. I realize everyone is different, but I didn't see any energy change or any appetite control from it, even taking the maximum dosage. I'm only 5'0"" tall but have a very high caffeine tolerance. It may work for some but my experience wasn't great."
2,Handle with Care,Been taking 2 caps 2x a day for the past 2 weeks and besides having a faster heart rate and getting more anxious I haven't lost any weight. I eat around 1850 calories a day and was really hoping that this would push me over the edge to lose weight.. but sadly no results to date.
4,Works great!,They work great and a lot cheaper then GNC. I'll be ordering them from here for now on. Thanks Amazon for the Great deal and free shipping.
5,Isatori Maximum Strength Lean System 7,"Wonderful product, doesn't make you jittery, I have seen a large decrease in my appetite and have lost 7lbs in 3 weeks"
2,can't handal it,"this thing makes me too jittery and unable to fall asleep at night, I didn't bother finishing it. I feel sick to my stomach and slight headache every time I take it, even at less than the recommended doses."
1,Worst Than Expected!!,"The effects of this fat burner are barely noticeable, I follow a diet combined with a cardio routine and there is no results... the ""mental focus"" is false... make your conclusions... ( I take it for 45 days aprox.)"
4,super fat burner,"Great product. Really gives you an intense burn without any side effects. Makes my workouts last much longer than without it. You will sweat with this product. So far, the best that I have tried."
5,LEAN SYSTEM 7,I really like this product. I was looking for something to curb my appetite and give me some energy without making me feel jittery. I LOVE IT!! I have been using this product off & on for the last 2 years. It curbs my appetite and gives me energy without me feeling shaky. I usually just take one pill a day 30 minutes before lunch (which is my biggest meal).
5,Worked great for me! Got ripped in 4 weeks!,"I've been taken this product for six weeks now but saw dramatic, cosmetically noticeable results in about four weeks. I do cardio 5-6 times a week and strength training (including abs training) 3-4 times a week. My diet includes eating 6-7 high protein meals a day (higher carbs in the morning) and plenty of water.I take this supplement 30 minutes before my morning cardio (which I do on an empty stomach) and again 30 minutes before either dinner or evening workout. Do not take this after 7:00pm unless you do not plan on sleeping! Also, stay away from other caffeine products.MX-LS7 added that extra boost I needed to burn extra fat! My six pack is now very well defined! Highly recommended."
4,Works Great,"This product combined with hard training (5-6 days a week)and a clean diet will produce great results, i would suggest using it for 4 to 6 weeks and taking it only in the morning hours because you will be jacked up all night otherwise! If you are serious about losing some stubborn fat, and you aren't afraid to train hard, MX-LS7 will be a great supplement for you!"
1,not doing anything,"im an athlete and i tried this while i was training hard for the whole time,i didnt feel any type of affect, they say it heats the body but its not. does not wake u up, they say do not take before going to sleep cause this will not let u sleep... i was getting more sleepy after noon after on hour from taking the pills.bottom line dont try this before u try some other products, if nothing help and u got the money give it a try..."
1,do not buy,"I HAVE PRODUCTS LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THIS ONE DOES NOTHING. I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN. I FOLLOWED WHAT IT SAID AND STILL NOTHING,I GO TO THE GYM 4TO5 DAYS A WEEK AND I EAT A GOOD DIET. I WOULD RECOMEND TO LOOK AT OTHER PRODUCTS."
1,Not very effective,While there was some boost not near as much as with Stacker's. Its claim to be the most powerfull I think was a poor choice of verbs. I will moy purchase product again and have no doubt this review will also not be posted.
1,It haven't worked!,"Unfortunatelly, the two people who used the product reported liver problems, and had stop using it after a few days."
2,Meh..not worth it.,"I only felt a difference the first couple days, but nothing after that. I felt a little too jittery on this, too. There are much better options."
2,Didn't work for me,"I run, cardio, weights, etc. I'm in fairly good shape, but wanted to see if it would help with the love handles. No changes or assistance beyond what I already do in the gym."
2,Not what I expected,I thought this would be better than the regular Isatori but I didn't notice any increased energy. I do not recommend this product over the regular Isatori product (blue tables).
4,Great stuff,I have been using this fat burner off and on for years and it works great for me. It gives me lots of energy throughout the day without feeling sick or giving me the jitters. It also helps me work off those 10 or so plateau pounds I seem to build up every few years when I get really bored and switch up my workout activities. Overall it's a great well priced product.
4,Yes.,Works exactly as expected. Increases energy levels and boosts metabolism. You'll lose weight when combined with proper exercise and diet.
3,Hmmm...,"Didn't really notice anything with this, besides the smell of the bottle. I took it for about a month and then stopped. Didn't really work for me; I was used to taking Hydroxycut Hardcore until that had the recall, and haven't really found anything to replace it yet. This didn't work for me, but it might work for others."
2,Jittery mess...,Maybe it was just me but I tried taking 2 capsules instead of the recommended 3 and still felt like I was hyped up on amphetamines. Nauseas and jittery are the most appropriate descriptions of how I felt on these.Needless to say I stopped taking them after 4 days. Maybe you'll have better luck.
2,Not for everyone...,"Isatori Maximum Strength Lean System 7, 120 CapsulesWanted to give this a try since had used the regular Lean System 7. The regular one isn't a miracle, but it did help give you a boost for exercising and increased overall energy.Sadly the Maximum Strength did not work at all for me. It actually made me sick. I tried taking 2 pills in the morning with breakfast, and within an hour, I was suffering food poisoning like symptoms which only slowly got better over a 36 hr period. At a later time I tried 1 pill in the morning and had a less severe reaction but one that was very unpleasant none-the-less.Although I do like the regular Lean System 7, I cannot recommend the Max one. If you are interested in trying, I would suggest getting a small qty, and make sure it works for you, as would be smart for any supplement. I may have an allergy to one of the additional ingredients, but it is definately something to be more thoughtful of."
4,"Lyrically ingenious, fun and sincere","Minimal production reveals thought provoking lyrics delivered with genuine sincerity. An enjoyable mix-up of fringe theater mad science and quirky musical talent. ""Gated House and Garden"" is the track that led me to this album; maybe try that one first. If you like this, check out more of the artists on Olive Juice Music; they have a whole raft of cool, freaky, fun artists from NY and elsewhere."
3,Book is not as big as it appears,"Okay, the content of the book is great, but I'm not sure it is worth the $40 retail price tag. I'm very glad it is discounted here on Amazon, or I might feel rather upset about the book.First off, the book is about the size of a trade paperback and only has 63 pages. Do NOT expect a big book for your money here.Now, to the 'good stuff' There are great techniques and inspiration in the book, so it is definitely worth having, but I would not suggest paying full price for it, unless you've got the money to be throwing around."
2,Pretty but tiny and not very instructive,"This book has beautiful pictures and would be great for someone who is already a very proficient spinner and is just looking for interesting ideas. But for an almost $40 price tag, I expect a lot more detailed instructions, including pictures of each step, rather than just the finished piece. The introduction seems to be geared to beginners, but it contains no basic spinning instructions and very little explanation of the author's techniques. The book itself is very small, making some of the text difficult to read. Spinning books are difficult to review, as it's the sort of very visual and tactile art that really needs to be a video or in-person class, but if you're interested in art yarns, get this one from the library. Don't bother buying new."
1,Benjamin Franklin,Boring boring. This was just too boring to continue reading. Couldn't hold my intrest. I would not recommend it to any one.
4,Thoroughly entertaining movie,"I watched This is England on Netflix and found it to be an enjoyable albeit a vague movie about the skinhead culture or counter culture depending on how you perceive it. The movie basically has to do with the segregation between the skinheads, one section is just the traditional skinhead while the other section is the new nationalist skinhead. I was uninformed about what a skinhead actually was, it was my understanding that skinhead instantly meant a racist, however this wasn't the case as one of the skinheads is of Jamaican descent. All in all it's an enjoyable movie if you are looking for something a little different, a fan of British, movies or just want to check out a movie with solid performances and a good story."
2,"Great movie, bad DVD.","This review isn't about the movie, but rather about the quality of the DVD, which is poorly authored. The advertised extras are all there, the subtitles and alternate audio tracks are there, but the movie itself looks like some old AVI bootleg, not DVD-quality video. Namely, it's badly interlaced - meaning that any time there's movement on the screen, the moving object breaks up in to off-synch horizontal lines. This is something I don't see even on things like Youtube anymore, much less on a professionally released proper DVD. I've tried this disk on 3 different players, all with the same interlaced results."
4,This is England review,Very good movie which exceeded expectations. There is a fair amount of racism in the movie though which can be off putting at times.
3,Informative Where Other Skinhead Films Deviate,"While well done and informative about England's 1980s skinhead recession era, the pace was fairly slow. Significant to note is the storyline sticks to the true non-racist basis of the skinheads for the most part, though when the original gang founder returns to reclaim his territory he brings a new more harm-filled credo. The development of his story clearly compromises that of others in the film, which weakens the overall plot. In the end the story demonstrates that at the heart of any extremist group is a mentally unstable leader."
5,"Loved the movie, hated the skipping.","The movie is wonderful, the director Shane Meadows is great. I wish I had been alerted to the scratches on the back of the disc, which lead to a lot of skipping throughout the movie. Overall, I was just satisfied. The seller should not have listened it as ""like new,"" but that's what I get for ordered a used disc!"
4,"Good, not great!","I was psyched when I saw this preview! Finally it came out on DVD, of course I rented it right away. The acting is great, the story is good!Recommended to all movie lovers. If you like this movie, check out ""Green Street Hooligans""!"
4,Quite Powerful,"I wasn't at all surprised to learn this was largely autobiographical, because it damn sure felt real to me.We have a number of powerful themes, interwoven into a moving, somewhat disturbing film. Early on, quite funny as well. Excellent characterization, sharp dialogue, brilliant use of scenery, and a must-see movie that impressed the hell out of me. Hard for me to review, obviously, so I'm glad others have written about it before me."
4,This is England,This was a great film. I truly enjoy when I watch an honest film that does not have all of the cliche' hollywood garbage in it. It is a movie worth watching again.
5,spot on!,"I know several men who grew up in England in the 70s and 80s and they say that this movie is spot on! It is a great coming-of-age tale and is so well-done: not too sappy, not too melodramatic; just real and heart-wrenching. The kid, Thomas Turgoose, is phenomenal! I can't wait to see more movies with him in them. The choices this poor lad must face are very realistic and will make you think about war, race, class, and the absolute agony of adolescence. This is not to be missed! Anyone with a heart and a brain that works needs to see this movie."
5,Intense movie,WOw! This movie is dramaful. It follows the life of a 10 year old boy who is kinda lonely until he bonds and eventually gets taken in by a group of young punks.Worth the watch!
1,Made my daughter MORE scared,"There are scary pictures of monsters in this book--things like Frankenstein, zombies, two headed monsters...stuff like that. Things that my 4 year old has never been exposed to...until now. Now she's got all sorts of scary images in her head--things that never would have occurred to her before reading this book. I wish I had done the ""good parent"" thing and previewed this book before reading it to her, but we got it at our church library, so I didn't think I would need to! Uggghh!!!"
3,could've been better,This 80's compilation could be better if they change a couple of songs for better ones but the rest is OK
4,Good Mix,"while I feel they could have dropped the Bruce Willis Track&another track on this Set overall this Album is Good.Rick James gets things rolling,Debarge has a Classic Jam on Here&the Commodores,Temptations&Smokey Bring the Goods as well here.some Compliations Work&Some don't this one Works for me."
5,Good cable.,I own several of these and use them for mobile video DJ use. They always work great time after time. I buy a lot of the Belkin cables and I have never had an issue. Good product.
4,I Love This Song,Britney has done such a good job and im so happy to hear this song! Its got a great beat and madonna does a good job being featured in it! Get this CD!
5,well done film,"I really enjoyed this movie. This was a very well-done film. Great scenery, interesting story, character development... overall entertaining. I highly recommend this film!"
4,Great for all ages!,We have this and the Bug Bingo game from the same company. The best thing about the bingo games is they are fun and educational for ages 3 to 103. Everyone can enjoy playing the game together. The only negative is that the cardboard pieces can be bent by little fingers but I don't know what the alternative would be. I highly recommend this product.
1,Cheaply made junk...,"This laser pointer is just plain junk. It didn't even work right out of the box. I wouldn't even bother risking it, buy another laser pointer."
1,"Good for ""A"" day","This pointer is for those of you who want a laser for A day, this device seriously sucks. The construction of the laser pointer it self is really bad, and the quality of the dot is poor, in addition it will flicker on and off even if you have the activation button pushed. Only buy this if you only need one for a single day"
3,It's OK for a cheap laser.,"It was a good laser at first. Then I started having some trouble with it.1. The battery compartment doesn't like to stay on.2. The batteries that come with it SUCK!!!!!!!3. The heads don't like to stay on either.4. It's SMALL.It did have a good outcome to it....My dog loves it.My cats love it.I pranked some people with the heads.Got some good laughs out of it.Overall, it's an OK laser(for its price)."
4,Toy laser pointer review,I thought the company sent the product in a very timely manner. The product was exactly what I expected.
1,Pablum disguised as advice,"Summary: if you would just stop being a meany and start writing some thank you notes the world can be yours! Probably true, doesn't mean you need to read a book on it."
5,REVVED! is the perfect continuation of FISH!,"I have been waiting for a book like this to come along for more than three years. Harry and Ross do an outstanding job of driving home the three steps for getting others excited about going the extra mile--Winning Them Over, Blowing Them Away and Keeping them Revved. REVVED! is the kind of book you'll want to read over and over again--I've already read it twice. Also, the exercises at the end of the book are excellent and easy to use--great bonus material! REVVED! will not only make you more successful at work, but it will enable you to live your personal life more fully as well. I can't recommend this book enough! Read it and you'll see why."
5,Motivational,"This book is easy to read and most of all easy to implement! The examples used are realistic. I was so inspired by the book, my company hired Harry Paul as our speaker for a manager's conference. The feedback from our managers: ""They were more tuned in to their individual employees, which made their jobs easier!"""
3,Days of our lives in Bonanza.,"It's an ok episode if you like Pa Cartwright the best.Guest star, [Recardo Montalban] story line;Season 2 / episode 39...10/22/60Ben's life is saved by Malsou , an outcast Indian,and his wife. in gratitudeBen gives Malsou some landand a new start in life, much to the horror of neighbor like Dagget who hates Indians. When his wife is killed in a night time raid, Dagget blames Malsou and kills his wife."
1,Not Good,"The game was aweful. The animations of the goalies is terrible, they fall over and lay on the ground. A 100 mph shot looks about 30. I am at a loss for words, it just stinks. I think EAs game from 1997 is a better buy."
5,terrific,I use these as PJs because they don't get twisted when I change sleeping positions. The pair I had before this lasted at least 10 years!
4,Great Shorts,"They fit a wee bit tighter then I'd like. I'm a size 9-10 in pants and bought a Medium (which is usually what I order universally). A slight 'muffin' effect happens where the shorts end on my thigh (actually more above the knee because I'm short), which isn't very desirable, but I don't really mind it. They are perfect for lots of movement and running without your shorts flapping in the wind (and without chafing if you do wear something over it).I also love the length."
4,Great Coverage,"I like the longer length of this compression short for good thigh support. The material is soft against the skin, no chafing and it breathes well so moisture is transported away from the skin to the outside of the shorts."
3,"Good for wicking away sweat, but transparent!","I've had to use these running shorts along with my previous pair of too-short shorts. The Champion brand are great for wicking away sweat and keeping a tender body area dry however they are extremely see-through immediately upon putting them on! If I wear my black running shorts over these I get the best of both worlds, but for the price of these shorts I would prefer to only need one bottom that has thick enough fabric to not show off my underwear/skin."
5,I needed this!,"It helps because when I was a little heavier, yes my thighs would rub against each other. This helped me be able to run comfortably. Also I felt more decent than just wearing short shorts. The quality is great and the price is great from other stuff I have seen on here!"
1,Not suitable to wear as shorts,I ordered these for my daughters to wear under costumes so they could be modest while changing backstage between scenes. They normally wear misses size 4-6. The mediums were so small the fabric was see-through across the butt. Didn't work for our purposes at all.
5,champion exercise pants,"I do aerobics and fitness pump involving body bars, free weights, etc. I also use the bicycle, treadmill and eliptical. I am 68 years old and I hate the low slung waist even though I am thin. These shorts fit at the waist and offer great support. I would have bought more but they only had two pairs left."
4,Great purchase!,"As someone new to flyfishing, this chest pack had all of the features that I was looking for. All of my accessories fit into the multiple storage pockets which are easily accessible from the front of this pack, and it has allowed me to completely do away with a fishing vest. I looked at several other models from different brands and felt this was the best value for the money. The free shipping only increased the value. Overall, a great purchase!"
2,"Cheap price, cheap quality","We purchased these plates about 7 months ago. From the original 6 we now have only two left. The other 4 have cracked and been throw away. We put them in the dishwasher and didn't use the heat to dry but they still cracked. So, if you want to hand wash you may have better luck. If we had known these would be ""temporary"" plates we would have bought paper plates instead."
3,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,While these plates are very attractive they are not very durable and warp/melt easily even in the top rack with dish washer on delicate cycle. With really really hot water plates seem to get soft. So back to hand washing... :(
2,You will get only what you pay for!,Its one of the cheapest i found on amazon and I did not want to spend much. And I exactly got what I paid for. Quality is not good at all. Very thin. And Non-Microwaveable.
1,"Save your money, buy $1 plates at $ stores instead","I was skeptical about paying $5 a plate for these, but I wanted red, and this was the only one to come up. I'm very disappointed in them. I bought cheap melamine plates and bowls at a local dollar store that are better than these are.....they were washed in the dishwasher, dropped, etc., and they lasted better than these do. I wasted my money big time on these. Nobody wants to hand wash dishes anymore, *and* who doesn't use microwaves all the time? I was stupid to not believe the reviews already on here. I also bought the matching bowls, and one cracked in half when my GD accidentally dropped it. I should have known to just stick with Corelle or buy cheap from the dollar stores. If you have a lot of money to throw away, go for it. Otherwise, save your bucks on these expensive plates."
4,Red Plastic Plates,These plates are great everyday dinner plates (particularly for children) as long as you know to expect them to be plastic.
3,the Good and the Bad,"I bought these plates in Lime green in March of 2008 and have used them everyday since. The color, the size, shape and weight are all great. I hand wash and dry plates and have had no problems. I took 2 stars off because the plates stain (blueberries, beets, etc.). I paid under 2 dollars a plate from Amazon on sale and would buy again at that price."
4,Good One,"Was very satisfied. Love the volume control and the way headset feels on your head, very comfortable."
2,Failed quickly,"Folding design is rather gimmicky because it doesn't fold much smaller than it is unfolded. This was my second Logitech headset (tried a different model prior to this one) and the second to fail in a very short period of time. While it worked it was ok being comfortable to wear with good mic sensitivity and clarity, but it only worked for a few weeks before failing. Others seem to have better luck with it, but after two expensive failures I now avoid Logitech headsets. The significantly cheaper headset I have from another manufacturer has been working flawlessly for many months now."
4,good headset,"confortable, compatible and portable, this is a good headset.. the only thing I found not good for me is that the Mic does not has a noise cancel treat, so if you try to speak on a louded place the persone in the other side will recive all the noise..."
3,Great Product but hard on the ears,"Been using this for a year for skype calls, webinars, and listening to music. Kids use it for gaming on the computer when we are sharing the office.The Sound is clear, the mic is effective. However, it's not the most comfortable on the ears. The foamy earpads/earmuffs dissolved and ripped, and now it's even more uncomfortable on the ears.I appreciate the fact I can push the mic away from the mouth so that my breathing is not picked up on webinars and conference calls."
3,I tried loving it.,"Mic quality is pretty good and sound quality above average.It lost 1 star to each ear's comfort.It is really uncomfortable if you plan to use it long hours.If not, its pretty good for 1/2h of use."
1,Not Worth It,"I purchased this to replace a less expensive headset I got from Dell. That one only lasted about six months. So then I looked around for a better quality headset. From the reviews, I never expected this one to give me any problems, let alone be so short lived, but it only lasted six months as well before the sound on one side of it gave out. Add to that the fact that the design is uncomfortable and flimsy. Unless you can find this on sale somewhere for about twelve dollars, I can't recommend it to anyone. It's not worth more than that."
2,"Poor quality, uncomfortable, not very portable.","Length:: 9:51 MinsComparison ofLogitech 980356-0403 Stereo USB Headset 250,Logitech Premium Notebook Headset, andPlantronics Foldable USB Stereo Headset (Optimized for Laptop Use) (Audio 470 USB).Logitech 250 - comfortable USB headset which served well for several years.Logitech Premium Headset - poor quality (though mine is refurbished), uncomfortable, not especially portable. Not adjustable - if your head is too big, it squeezes, but if your head is too small, it'll probably fall off.Plantronics Foldable Headset - comfortable, very good quality, folds down nicely.If portability is an issue, go with the Plantronics. Otherwise, you may be better off with a direct USB headset such as the Logitech 250. Avoid the Logitech Premium."
1,Laptop Headset,This is the first Logitech product I purchased that had to be returned. The headset was so uncomfortable and it really did not reach your ears fully. It was cumbersome to use which made things worse. I would not recommend this product to anyone and Logitech should take it off the market. It hurts their product line.
2,Poor quality,"I don't know what to say really... I wouldn't buy these for $5, let alone the $30 asked for them. Bad audio quality and the microphone is as bad as they get. Steer clear of these."
2,overpriced,I bought these to bring them along on long distance motorbike travels.ProsFirst of all the sound is good and the mic is doing its job just fine. I like the mic control switch combined with the volume adjustment. They are comfortable to wear.ConsThey don't fold up small at all and therefore are not very good for travelling. The travelbox that comes with it is actually way too big to travel with unless you travel in a car or motorhome and volume is not really an issue. Then the tip of one of the plugs fell off and I had to replace it with another one. The plugs seem to be low quality. And now one of the plastic cover bits on one of the earpieces fell off.ConclusionReasonable quality headset but not worth the price and not compact at all. If they cost one third it would be a good deal. Not the price that I got them for here at amazon.
2,Volume Controls Breaking???,"OK, so this may just be me and my boyfriend getting crappy headsets making us the lucky one out of so many but we both have this headset because he is far away a lot and so we Skype chat. Both of us have found that talking to each other with these has become ANNOYING. The volume control has broken on mine, so it goes too far, I lose hearing in my right earpiece. Then, it just slides around without TOUCHING it. Then, when you take it off after talking for like, 3 or 4 hours, you can TELL that your headset was pressing into your head because if you don't rub your ears, there is pain. We are both sort of looking into new headsets for the time being we are dealing with the annoyance though.But, like I said, this is just my boyfriend and I. I'm not going to speak out against them COMPLETELY... Just be warned that after like, a month you may find that the volume control has gone to the toilet and that your ears will start to hurt if you keep the headset on for too long."
4,Logitech notebook headset... excellent for PC use,"I have had this product for 2 weeks now and really like it. It has surprisingly high quality sound and adds an extra level of usability to my Skype use. The mike is a little hard to adjust properly, but, once you figure out gives you excellent quality voice calls. I recommend this for anyone who makes calls from the computer, conferencing, etc. It is well above par for music as well. Good product, great price."
4,Great Buy for Notebook Headset!,"Logitech Premium Notebook HeadsetJust got my first headset for my laptop and love it! This headset comes with a USB connector to power it properly but the sound quality is excellent. I use it on Skype every day and it sounds better than any of my phones (mobile and land). It comes with a handy little travel case which was great for a recent trip. It all fit nicely into my carrying case. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because I cannot seem to get the Mute button to work. I can use the mute feature in Skype, but when I am standing up it would be nice to not have to run back to the laptop and hit mute if I need to cough or someone is talking loud in the background. All-in-all a great product for the price."
5,Best Notebook Headset Ever!,"I tried many notebook PC headset and they all had problems such as ill fitting, too large or too small and some broke because they did not fold properly or did not have a carry case.This Logitech headset is well engineered, folds easily, fits properly on your head and has a carry case to protect it when you travel.I'm looking forward to keeping this one for a long time."
4,"One word to describe it, ""Superb""","I have used different headsets (to work) with the voice recognition software, on my laptop. After the last headset got crushed in the laptop bag, I tried to find something with a case and noise cancelling features. This headset became the answer to my prayers. The setup was a breeze even on Vista, and the functioning..... as I said, in one word, superb! The included USB adapter is a bonus.An excellent product, and will last me for a long time, thanks to the sturdy case."
2,Work well but fit is very uncomfortable,"I had this headset for three years and used it every day for work, several hours a day. The overall quality of the construction of the headset is average. The sound is above average. There are additional controls on the cord which are convenient and while the +/- volume dial worked well, the mute toggle stopped working after about a year. The major downfall of this headset, and the reason for 2 stars, is the poor fit and subsequent discomfort and headache after wearing them for one hour or longer. This made them virtually useless since I needed them for video conferencing several hours each day. I purchased them because they folded up for travel, came with a hard case, and were rated well. I would not purchase them again."
2,Not a long term purchase.,"Have used this headset for a few years for Skype and gaming. The foam ear cushions will disintegrate over time and you can not get replacements from Logitech. They will offer you 50% off the list price on their web site which gets you a replacement at roughly street price. Not much of a deal. When you call tech support, they have you take the cushions off to find a secret ID number stamped in the plastic underneath. If the cushions were not already destroyed they will be after this move. Then, they inform you that they don't sell replacements, which I'm sure they knew before they had you destroy the old ones. I'll be using this headset without the cushions for many years before I buy another product from Logitech."
1,Simply doesn't work.,"I have never written a less than stellar review on any product from Amazon, but I am just so frustrated with this product.It doesn't work.I am computer savvy, and have used many headphones.I have two desktops and four laptops, and this won't work on ANY of them.I then took it into Best Buy, and the Geek Squad couldn't get it to work, and told me to Google, because this is a known defect with this item."
2,awkward,ok but the behind head strap is uncomfortable. there was no wind sock for the mic. fitting on ears is awkward. ok sound.
1,It does not work,Planned to use it for VOIP calls on Yahoo! and whoever I called could not hear me. Went into Radioshack and got one for $27.00 that works great.
2,Dissapointed,"Very cleverly designed. The adjustable headpieces are a nice touch (but on mine one of the ear pieces was so stiff that it was useless). Then you get a travel case that it fits neatly into and a usb convertor.All that though is irrelevant if the unit does not work properly. Sound quality was very poor and when used with a voice chat application you can turn the volume on the pc and headset way up to max and barely hear anyone. I've normally been quite happy with Logitech, so I was very dissapointed with these."
2,another disappointment,"my computer [brand new gateway tablet w/ vista and plenty of power] had a hard time registering this microphone even when it was on full volume. for kicks, i tried the speech recognition with the gateway's built in mic and it did just as good [poor] a job!! if you really need to dictate, stay away from this waste of money!!"
1,Inline short,"I have a lot of money tied up in this kind of thing.Therefore I take pains to look after and take care.I even mounted a hook to keep this thing safe and out of the way when not in use and also plugged into the back of the computer so as not to get snagged or anything else.It just ""developed"" a short where it meets the inline volume control.It's made with the cheap, flimsy wires like comes with a $2 fm radio.Short and sweet. JUNK."
1,Headset,"Logitech ClearChat Comfort USB HeadsetThe product was so hard to get open unless you tear open the packaging, which makes it imposssible for you to return. It would never function and was very uncomfortable.Its sitting in he closet gathering dust now.Rod Aymond"
4,Very Good Headset for home & travel,"I bought this headset for my wife who has had problems finding a comfortable headset. I am a home-based teleworker and have been using one of these headsets everyday for almost 3 years. I use it at home with my desktop mostly and like that it folds up into a case for traveling. I also like the flexibility of using the standard jack connections or the USB sound adapter.I've used it with Nortel VOIP clients, Skype and for gaming. I have gotten compliments from other Nortel VOIP users that the microphone sound quality is excellent - better than the Nortel headsets.I've only had a minor problem with a pin at a joint in the headband working itself out a little. One improvement I would like to see are more sound isolating ear foam pieces. Perhaps, a denser foam may help. Other than that, I am very happy with the quality, operation and portability of this headset. So is my wife."
4,Not bad at all,"The headset works really well. I use it mainly for Skype and i've never had a problem with it yet. It comes with a travel box and a USB adapter that you can plug your mic and headphone inputs into. It's very flexible for each individual. You can adjust the earpieces for a nice comfortable but snug fit, the mic is clear, and the audio is great. You can control the volume and mute the mic if need be. My only problem with it is that I tend to talk laying down and the headphones aren't comfortable to lay on (which is fine because it's not what it's used for). Other than that, it's worth the price."
5,"Wow, I am very impressed with Logitech quality","Take out of box, plug in and enjoy... this headset has a great sound and noise cancelling microphone works so well and sounds great. They are very comfortable and I could see using them for a period of time. Used with Skype and ran the Echo/Sound Test and my voice was so clear and clean. Listening to music right now and the sound is clear, clean and loud enough that I only need to have the volume set to half way. The carrying case is added plus and the USB Adaptor works great, but remember to push the plugs all the way in, they hang a little but fit very secure. I did research on Amazon for a good laptop headset for Skype and audio/visual conferencing and it was close but I chose this pair and do not regret a bit. I can see folding and unfolding is a little tricky but with practice it will go easier, not a negative at all. The Price is not bad considering an equal style through work is over $100."
4,Great for a single use,"Great headphones for skype or other VOIP applications. Too bulky to use at the gym or while running (it'd look odd). Excellent sound, great microphone. The carrying case really helps too."
3,Too close,"This headset is difficult to adjust correctly. While it will stay on, it feels as if it's slipping no matter how I adjust it. Also, it's not possible to wear it without having the microphone too close causing popping ""p""s."
3,Not bad,I don't have a bunch of headsets to compare it too and I am not a finicky audiophile. I like the case and the flexibility of USB or plugs. I bought an adapter so it will work with a single stereo/mic plug as well.
5,Soft Phone,Needed a headset that I could carry in my laptop case. These fold up and have a hard case to store them. They work great with my soft phone. They rest nicely on your ears and mic is very adjustable.
3,Must use USB for Mac OSX 10.5,"I am by no means a frequent headset user, but I needed one for some overseas skype calls i needed to make so I picked one up. My logitech mouse works great so I decided to stay ""brand loyal"". Overall I would say it works good, and the headsphones are pretty comfortable. It comes with a carryingcase, which is nice, although I'm not sure I would really travel with them. The only downer for me is that I had to use the USB attachment for them to work. If I just plug in the mic and headphone jacks only the headphone works, OSX'x system won't pick up the mic line unless you use the USB connection. Not sure if it is logitech or Mac's fault, but either way it makes it less useful for a Mac user as you have to eat up one of your USB slots."
3,Decent. But Overpriced,"I forget exactly how long I had this product. Probably a little over a year.. maybe 2. And the mic just went out. I don't know how long these things are supposed to last, so I don't know if that's good or bad.PROS: Carrying case. It folds into a stylish black box nicely to fit into my laptop bag. The headphones fold flat so that it can fit into a thinner case. Microphone comes around and goes in front of your mouth... not next to your cheek which I liked a lot. Microphone can flipped out of the way on days when you don't need it. Sound quality and microphone I think were exactly what you should expect from a headset. No complaints there. The USB adapter was great! When my microphone jack broke on my computer, I was able to use it to replace it. Microphone mute button is useful.CONS: THE MICROPHONE went out on me after a year or so. But this is to be expected with all headsets I think.. especially wired ones where you have to fool around with the wires all the time."
4,Another Great Logitech Product,"I have only used this headset with my note book so I don't know about performance or compatibillity with any other devices.I used the USB adapter and Windows XP Pro recognized it immediately. I configured the setup in Control Panel with no problems at all.The sound is very good... not audiophile, but very nice. The chord is a little long for notebook use, but that is better than too short.The headset fits well on the head and adjust easily. I did noticed that after about 30 minutes it did seem a bit tight on the ears. I might add that I have a 7 1/2 hat size and everyone's head is different of course.The volume adjustment is convenient and the mic mute works.The carry case is nice.I have never had any problems with any Logitech products and I have a lot of them.One other plus, there was no huge software suite that needed to be installed.I am very happy with the headset.I gave it 4 stars because I believe it is a bit spendy."
3,Logitech headset,My company uses Skype for colloboration and communication while we're offsite. The sound reception and transmission quality greatly improved utilizing this product.
2,"Clumsy, weighty, dumbells.","The components--earpieces and microphone--are actually good quality. The design, however, is plain stupid. If you wear glasses, just forget it.That being said, if you want a pair of dumbbells hanging on your ears, then go ahead. The earpieces do pivot and have a minimum range of horizontal adjustment. But adjusting them so the band doesn't push the back of your ears out is not conducive to best audio quality due the pear shaped design of the earpiece, which fit the ear best in the upright pivotal position."
4,"Accurate, sensitive microphone good for voice recognition","PLUS --The microphone works well with Dragon naturally speaking voice recognition software. I'm using it to write this review while listening to the radio and there are very few errors. Also, I like that the cord is nice and long, so you don't necessarily feel tied to the computer. You can move around quite a bit. The headset looks sleek and modern and isn't bulky like many others.MINUS --It might be perfect, if only the headband were more adjustable. This isn't a big deal, but strangely, the width is locked in place and you cannot adjust it to better fit your neck and head. The ear pads are adjustable,but I haven't found that feature very useful.VERDICT --Overall, this is a comfortable headset and a good pick for voice recognition."
4,"amazing for a reconditioned unit, unsure about full price","Bought this reconditioned, came perfect in the box. A real joy compared to my old logitech headphones much better sound reproduction. If your computer is older I imagine the USB converter is good - but I didn't notice much difference.I am a particular person when it comes to sound, but not willing to pay for it. This exceeded my expectations, plenty of adjustability. Fit and finish are good, but not premium."
1,It is broken,"I have used it for a while. Suddenly the microphone has stopped working, but the headphone set seems to be working. I do not recommend this product. Probably this was the last product I would ever get from Logitech. Bye bye Logitech!"
4,Logitech Headset Pretty Good,"I purchased the Logitech Premium Notebook Headset because it was recommended by a longtime user. I am really pleased with the physical quality of the headset and the sound is great both sending and receiving. I also like the volume adjustment for the earphones. My only issue is that it is a bit cumbersome. It's a little heavy and consequently doesn't sit as comfortably over the ears as I'd like. I use it for personal calls over Skype and will endure the minor discomfort to achieve the call quality. However, if I used this in business and had to wear it for the better part of the day, I'd probably switch to an over the head type set."
4,"Good, but not perfect","I've been using these for several years now and they're still going strong. They're comfortable enough for all-day wear, and the microphone quality is very good--people say that I sound better on these over Skype than I do on a land line. I do have a few small nits about them, though: 1) I've adjusted them to be as small as possible and they just fit my head. For folks like me with smaller-sized noggins, they just barely fit. 2) The tactile feel of the mute switch is poor; it's a plasticky slider that felt like it'd break after a few hundred uses, but it's held together through many thousands of uses. 3) The volume, at least when plugged into a Mac, is OK but I wish it could be a bit louder. It can be difficult to hear someone who's soft-spoken or far away from their microphone."
4,Note on use with a Mac laptop,"Just got this headset as a replacement for an older Logitech that went south. I'll need time to test it out. Preliminary reaction is that the design (on your head) takes time to get used to, but the sound is pretty good. I had originally planned on using the mini-jack connection into my MacbookPro for audio out and line in. However (and this is my fault for not knowing) using a mike with the Mac's line in requires a device with its own power. So I'm back to using the USB connection instead, which I hadn't planned on."
2,"Three Strikes, You're Out","I would have given this headset 4 or 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that i have just gone through my third pair. I bought them three times and that should say a lot, however, i keep having to buy a new one for the same reason: poorly put together. The ear adjustment just keeps becoming really lose and/or braking. This causes it slide off your ear very easily and constantly needs adjusting.Another complaint, although minor, would be the volume knob. Unless attached to you, it always seems to get in the way and the volume unintentionally changed.Other than that, i really enjoyed the headset. I do not recommend buying it, however, if you plan on using it a lot or are heavily into playing games on your computer."
2,"not durable, sound good","worked okay for linux(debian etch) with skype. clear sound, microphone picked up voice fine.i do a lot of traveling with backpack, carried this around in its case, one side of headphones stopped working after month and a half."
2,Worked fine until the earpiece broke,"The mic and earphones on this headset worked and work great, however the cheap plastic used to make the headset broke where one of the ear pieces connects, so while I COULD technically still use my set, it would uncomfortable and impractical. I had this about two months, using it maybe a few hours a week at the office before it broke on me."
2,Please do not buy this product - it is so flimsy,"I used it for three days and the unit broke. Sounds fine, but the materials are very flimsy and you can break it so easy. Had to return to Amazon for refund.I would not but this again."
4,Logitech headset with mic,"Audio (in and out) is very good. Ergonomically good...Sometimes if you have a program running already, then plug it in the usb, it won't work with that program until u restart the program..."
5,Great!,Pretty good set of headphones for an on-the-go person. I carry it around with me to use on my MSI Wind. I tripped on my old headphone cord and somehow messed up the headphone jack on the Wind. This USB headset works perfectly. I just plug it in and it goes.It's compact and lightweight. So if you were looking for a mobile headset pick this up. It's perfectly priced as well!
4,Solid Headset/Good for Dictation,"I was pleased with this headset, which I use for dictation with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. The headset itself is solid, and the behind-the-head feature was a selling point for me. It lives up to my expectations in this area. The dictation performance has been good, and I see no reason why this product would not also a good for Internet chatting or phone calls. Of course, this headset also folds to a small size, and it comes with a sturdy plastic box. I have not used it for travel, but I probably will. I gave this product four stars -- for very good. It did not amaze me, but I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Had this product for almost 3 years now,Pros:1) Good sound Quality2) Durable as its still going strong after every day of use. (However the cushion pads for the ears have fallen apart on me after 2 years)Cons:1) It is not comfortable as it left marks around the ear area after long periods of use2) Expensive. (Not worth more than $25)
3,"Comfortable, compact, but terrible microphone",I've given up on having to yell for the other person to hear me. Need to find a new headset.
3,Just a so so set up...,Not to impressed with these headphones because I cannot get them to work properly. I should have sent them back.
1,Why bother?,"This is your typical, often high priced, poorly made, undependable headset. It is so hard to find a high quality and durable headset in one. If you find one let me know. I only gave it one star because the rating system does not allow for zero or less stars."
1,"Shinobi, a waste of time","I have heard that people really liked the game play of Shinobi, but I felt it was really lacking in some areas. Althought the fights were very interesting and actually fun to go through, it ended up being the same thing over and over again. Also, the story progressed nicely, but it you really had no hand in how the story progressed. It was as if you were in a maze and your objective was to get to the other end of the maze, but the only problem is the maze only consists of a solitary line, going from beginning to end.I just do not see any re-play value in the game!"
4,none,"ok lets get started.here r some cons.this game is freaken hard.if ur good at video games then u might be able to beat this hard 1200 level game.its fun if ur any good.the game starts mediam then if u beat it u can play it on hard if u beat hard u get extremly hard if u beat that u get easy.easy is like u against 36 bots on god like in the game ""unreal tournement"" thats just how hard this game is.here r some pros.its got great but hard gameplay and if u kill all the enemies in a ariea in a serten amount of time u get a cool cut seen.ya thats about all the pros i can think of but when i say the game play is good i mean it and the gameplay over powers every con u can think of.and thats my review."
3,PS2 is still great!! but this could have been better !!,"I kinda!!!!!! liked it at first then more than 2 stages into this game,i started to get fed up of the repeatitive meaningless gore , bad camera angles and horrible gameplay if you like it you don't know what a good game is!!!!!!!!!!! then try ninjagaiden (xbox )then tell me whats wrong with this boring trite excuse for a ninja adventure or did i dog the story line???????????????????? its pitetic but!!!!!! what do i know i live in a third world country , Trinidad!!!!!!! some how we know hog wash when we see it, have a good time playing a bad game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,beware of this game!!,"Beware!!!! i watch all the reviews and thought it was a good game WROGGGGGGGGGG i played for two stages and that was it for me.lost all interest right away. so BEWARE this is a waste of money.im not going to waste writing more because it doesnt ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZ sorry i felt sleep, i try to play it again zzzzzZZZZZZZ"
2,"all flash, no substance","i had high hopes for this game, and bought it the day it came out. i absolutely loved the old shinobi series, and was glad to see a new installment. but this game fails to take advantage of the 7 years of progress in gaming since the ""shadow dancer"" hit the streets for the genesis. the potential was there for this game to follow in the footsteps of the tenchu, metal gear solid, and siphon filter series - open-ended levels, a need for stealth and intelligence, and an arsenal of cool weapons and items. instead, this game is a basic hack-and-slash affair with very little room for improvisation. you have a couple of cool moves, but can fly through levels just jumping around and swinging your sword. aside from the graphics and cutscenes, this game was a HUGE letdown."
2,Disappointed.. Not what I expected!,"After seeing this game on TV commercials & on GTV (Games TV on Digital Cable CH.136) I decided to BUY this instead of renting first which you should not do. Anyway, The graphics are looking 32 bit (Genesis) and the gameplay is just like a typical sega genesis game! I agree with the guy below, Falling in a pit is gaurenteed more than your satisfaction with this game. You can tell this was a rushed project! The cutscenes are the highlight of this game, they were cool but the graphics during gameplay ....! The enemy AI is worse than Ninja Turtles & GTA, They might as well be mannaquins! The obstacles were harder than the enemies. The first boss is a helicopter which is lame! I highly recommend Way of the Samurai & Devil May Cry 2 instead if this game. Dante will be able to run along walls in the upcoming sequel! Rent this before buying!"
5,osum game,"this game is asome.you will fight your way throu hords of ninjas but,I think it should be rated T.the 2nd BOSS is alomost invicible you`ll still get a kick out of this game.it should still get a 5 star rating.wy donn`t you trie it your self."
2,Hard,This game is way to hard and repetitive. Your sword eats away at your health if you don't feed it. The graphics aren't that good. The levels look alike. Hard to master the controls. The story is stupid.
5,Shinobi,"I love this game! The action, the style, the difficulty and the all the gore!This game is pretty simple but it is very difficult. There is no complex combo system or items to manage and use but there are many bottomless pits, enemies that do massive damage and just failing to perform certain attacks with pinpoint timing may cause you to fall to your death. This game will piss you off but if you have the patience to develop the reflexes necessary to beat this game then you will be amazed. I love the cutscenes, the music, the graphics and the simple gameplay.You have to try to game."
3,TOO DAMN HARD!,"I love this game, but it's way too hard. I couldn't get past the first few stages.Frustrating, but a fantastic game!"
1,What the heck!,"Okay? I see a lot of great reviews for this game. Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game. I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics! then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive. Plus people say how shinobi looks cool???? I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while. And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics. Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2. This game really blows! It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone. Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short! The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it! Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it. Trust me!"
4,"Shinobi is Hard, but fun!",Shinobi is one of those games that won't let you through a stage until you master it. If you want a good game with high difficulty then shinobi is you game. Also if you collect 40 orobo clan coins scattered throughout the game you can play as the original shinobi--Joe Mushasi.
3,Good game for back in the day,Shinobi was a very fun game back when it first came out. I can't seem to see the fun in this one though. This would have been great if it came out 4 years ago. It is just out of time.
4,"Shinobi is very good, but verry frustrating","I think Shinobi is one of the coolest games i have ever played. I have played better games, but this is one of the most fun to play and watch. The only problem I have with it is that it is very frustrating, and there are no check points. The other thing is that all the rooms in a level look the same. other then that, this game is awsome."
4,HARD BUT FUN,"It's been a while since I played a game that makes me want to smash the controller, and this game almost made me do it. This game has a leraning curve that it's not that difficult to learn, and once you learn it it turns out to be a pretty good game, the graphics coulb be a bit better during gameplay, but one thing that should be in this game it's save check points, because if you do not finish the level and decide to turn off the game, you have to start it from the begining of the level yo did not finished. The boss fights are a bit difficult specially the last boss, that one took me about a week to beat it, I looked for tutorials on youtube and saw some videos wich they killed him in about five minutes, I guess they practiced alot.If you are looking for a hard game to play with it, this is for you, plus we all love Shinobi games.Play On!!!!!!"
2,Disgrace to the original,"I remembered playing Shinobi (the original arcade version) when I was a kid and it was the first game I ever beat. That was a great feeling and I'll never forget that. I was really looking foward to this and I bought it the first day it came out. All the other reviews are correct, after level 2 it got repeative (even the graphics)and really difficult. If anyone decides to play this I recommend gameshark codes, you'll need them. I like challenges but this was more frustrating than a challenge. I was very dissapointed with this, they could've done so much better. This game I wished I waited till the price went down, definately not worth the $50, but I went ahead and bought it anyways; bad mistake on my part. Some will like this and some will not."
2,Fails on many levels,"If you can't handle a full on rant don't read this or my Golden Axe Beast Rider review I did a few months back. So here we go Shinobi PS2 or Shinobi 5 if you are a casual gamer don't bother with this game it's very difficult. It has to be said d**n you Sega you have to bring back an old franchise & like how Sega has been ran since they went 3rd party have f***ed it up & the story is pretty good but sh***y controlls ruin it bad camera angles the controller freezing up I have to skip levels which makes me miss out on a pretty good story & it's about this ninja Hotsuma who is trying to stop this group from resurrecting this Sorcer most of his clan have been killed & Tokyo is on the verge of collapse because of these new creatures called Hellspawn. Other than a good story this game is epic fail to what could have been a epic game. To Sega Shinobi, Golden Axe & Sonic all kicked a** on the Genesis/Megadrive 1989-1998. How about you play the original Genesis games Simon Jeffry."
2,Where Do you Get Fun Here?,I personally cant Believe i spent [the] bucks on this game. i never thought that sega made that good of games and they seem to be keeping it that way. I was bored sick with this game after one hour. The Music is terrible the graphics are OK but the enimies you face are 100% corny! Where do the winged Heads come into the story?...
3,Smelly,"The pillow is actually comfortable, but the smell of the foam is overwhelming when you put your face on it, airing it out doesnt really help. Maybe if you put 4 pillow cases on it..."
4,Comfy and neutral smelling,"This pillow is nice and comfy. I checked for the foul smell of foam and detected nothing, unless I really really pressed my face deep into the foam, and even so it's just a mild smell that I'm sure every memory foam pillow would have. It's nothing you would even detect while lying in a normal position on the pillow. The smell of my old (now retired!) down pillow was actually much worse by comparison."
4,"Amazing, but very large, briefcase.","The briefcase is very well made, with lots of compartments and room. It is an excellent buy. Because of its large size and rugged construction, it is more like a portable desk. Quality is really high. It's too large to be simply a laptop case, but if you have to carry a lot of papers, books, a computer, your lunch, etc., it's perfect...and a great deal."
1,Not Acceptable,I was expecting a rugged easy open case with some padding. What I got was a hard to open non structurally reinforced bag. I went back in the box and was returned. Somewhat dissapointing.
3,"Good Overview, Bad Editing","This book is full of typographical and grammatical errors, as well as mis-worded and poorly worded sentences - surprisingly poor editing from a mainline publisher (McGraw-Hill); these shortcomings in the editing distract from the effective presentation of the material. The book does provide a good overview of short selling, and some of the associated strategy (basically stock fundamentals research) for determining which stocks to sell short, but I found myself longing for more depth. The presentation would have been more effective with more specific examples with associated charts and sell/buy points. And I think the book should also have gone into more depth about bull/bear market cycles and how these relate to the timing of selling short, and the respective dangers and opportunities offorded by the direction of the overall market."
4,easy & yummy,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the sauce was kind of bland. But this meal was easy to make. I can't have Gluten so since these noodles are made of rice I can eat them. That is huge! Filling, good & easy, couldn't really ask for more. Next time I'll probably add something to the sauce to make it a little more interesting. But for around 2 bucks this is great."
5,Good for kids,"This is an exciting movie that does not contain all of the adult only stuff that most ""off road"" movies have. My kids love it."
5,Great Textbook,"This textbook is for a very specialized subject, Aviation Maintenance Management. The author has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field and shares that throughout the book. The book is mainly geared toward civil aviation maintenance management and in particular the airlines. However, the information and explanations are detailed enough to cover the subject, yet easy to read. Tables and figures are placed appropriately in the text to reinforce learning. The book is organized logically and can be used by any professor to build a class curriculum around it. The appendixes add depth to material by discussing uncommon, but relevant subjects. Finally the author has well documented the text with references to the FAA Regulations, Advisory Circulars, and reports. In summary this is an excellent textbook for use in a classroom environment or as a stand alone book to further one's knowledge of Aviation Maintenance Management!!!!"
2,not receive it,"It was estimated that the book would arive on 26th January 2011, and I still not get it untill now.Please help me to check what's wrong with the book as soon as possible, thanks very much."
3,Aviation Maintenance Management,"I bought this book with the intention of attending a class requiring it. The class had two prospective students sign up for it and it was cancelled. I will hang on to it and hope that the class is offerd again, with this version of the book."
1,New games? Where are all the games?,"I was suprised at how few games this 137 page book contains, 10 total. I have come up with more new poker games in 30 mins with friends than this book offered. It takes him 14 pages on how to play Follow the Queen, could have been done in 2. This book is all fluff. Come up with your own games, this book offers nothing for those looking to branch out."
2,"good as brief view, tends to analyse unimportant points","The book is nice to read, and shows some important points, but has two main drawbacks: 1. It elaborates very much on unuseful and unimportant differences in syntax, while not focusing on principal differences. 2. It has too many cross references, making it sometimes hard to follow if you're not a C/C++ expert."
2,C++ comparison for C++ programers,"I am a java programmer trying to learn C++, and find this book VERY hard to follow.Most of the syntax is not explained and too much time is spent explaining subtle details, rather than key concepts. Some of the real differences between c++ and java are clouded with confusing fragments of explanation, mixed with unexplained code.It seems to be more of a comparison or overview for C++ programmers than an introductory book for java developers.I am confused and left reading pages over and over again trying to make sense of this language. I think it would have been easier and quicker to just buy a c++ book, forgoing my java background."
1,stuck forever on mission 2,"played mission where you have to blow up a whole bunch of boats and barges going down a river in a certian amount of time. I've tried aleast 75 to 100 times and can't get any further. When are they going to program in by-pass capability so when your stuck at least you can move on, finish the game and get your moneies worth of play from it."
5,Great music,"This recording captures the essence of Glass minimal composition, and has the same feeling and emotion that his other solo piano recordings contain.In fact, this is one of the best solo piano recordings in my opinion, since their is much more variety here than compared to the album ""Solo Piano,"" and there is more emotion on this compare to Etudes Vol. 1. This is also a good recording since there are only two songs that are borrowed from other recordings, namely Facades from Glassworks, and Metamorphosis #3 from Solo Piano. Facades is a beautiful song on solo piano, and actually sounds better on this without the flute in my opinion. Arguably the best solo piano Glass recording to date. the second best I would say is the Orphee Suite for solo piano, then 3rd is Etudes, then 4th is SoloPiano."
3,Standard Christmas songs,What else can I say? These are standard songs used for beginner learnings on the harp. Interest beginners can then try to play other music from memory or other music.
2,(Not) the Greatest Book that ever was,"Fans (like me) of J. Michael Veron's 1st golf fantasy/mystery, ""The Greatest Player Who Never Lived"" surely have been anxiously looking forward to the release of Veron's follow-up, ""The Greatest Course That Never Was."" This second book is okay but not nearly up to the standards of the 1st book. The premise is just so far-fetched; as my friends asked me, ""How can there be a great golf course that exists but no one knows about?"" Veron's solution to this is puzzle is fairly absurd. I won't spoil it here. Yes, it is fun reading -- IF you are a total golf fanatic, and enjoy things like hearing a recapitulation of every shot the protagonist played in an 18-hole round. As the book prgresses, the plot gets more and more ridiculous and the coincidences more outlandish. It is always a fine line asking the reader to suspend belief and indulge in fantasy; Veron pulled it off with the ""greatest player"" book but did not with the ""greatest course."""
5,An Incredible Story,"Charley Hunter, who uncovered Beau Stedman in ""The Greatest Player Who Never Lived"" is back and this time he hooks up with Moonlight McIntyre, an old caddie from Augusta National so Charley can tell the story of a secret golf course that was built by none other than the legendary golfer Bobby Jones. This book is fascinating in that you virtually go with Charley and Moonlight to find this golf course and experience the magic of the course as if you were there. It has mystery, intrigue, legal encounters, is loaded with golf history and has stories within the story. It even has a secret within the golf course! Even if you don't play golf, this book is so well written and the golf history blended in so well with the story that it becomes a believeable story that's almost real and thoroughly enjoyable. You can lose yourself in this story and when you get through reading it you feel like you've been a part of it. What an incredible story. Keep them coming!"
3,Disappointed after reading 'The Greatest Player',"This review may be a bit unfair because I so thoroughly enjoyed Veron's first work. But, I simply felt that for most of 'The Greatest Course' Veron wasn't going anywhere. This book lacked the great balance between suspense and golf history that made the first work so enjoyable. Veron spent most of his time rehashing the same Bobby Jones and Augusta type stories from the first book. The book read more like a narrative history, which would have been alright if the book was not fiction."
4,Another winner,"Not quite as good as ""The Greatest Golfer Who Never Lived"" but still definitely worth reading. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,The thin line between farce and tragedy,"Few authors explore the juxtaposition of tragedy, reality and farce as frankly and yet compassionately as Evelyn Waugh. His everyman heroes - to include Crouchback, the central character of this tale - seem intuitively to understand and uncomplainingly accept that rather than representing points on a continuum, tragedy/reality/farce exist simultaneously, and that the only thing a good Englishman can do in the face of the chaos that inevitably ensues is to strive to do his duty, preserve his dignity, and maintain a stiff upper lip. Could be that Waugh is just an adept social satirist - but I suspect his insight has a lot to do with growing up British. Goodness knows, in 3000 years of history the English have had ample opportunity to observe how often farce and tragedy coexist. This story provides many, many examples of both in the run-up to WW2, embedded in a tale that may leave you - as it left me - simultaneously laughing and mourning. Excellent read."
2,Dissapointing,"I was expecting to greatly enjoy this satire of one English gentleman's mobilization for WWII, but came away bitterly disspointed. I found it very flat and dull, with none of the bite and sharp wit I had expected. The story follows a middle-aged man who comes home to become an officer after living for eight years in Italy. The books plods about as he goes through training and then gets moved all over England with his regiment. It's all rather dreary and slow, and the few moments that twinkle are not worth the time spent to discover them."
2,maybe,"The story is good, it's even funny though it takes part during a war but I think the main problem is me. I think I've overgrown such tediousness."
1,Wow! Was I suckered into buying this Garbage!,If you like to waste money on a CD that only has one hit. this one should be the one you buy. If I could... I would give this 0(ZERO) stars it's really that bad!
1,what a joke,"i really don't know what made me buy this cd, but i can only hope to prevent you from making the same mistake!i was intrigued by the inclusion of Danny Saber in this group, and read some inaccurate magazine reviews. the music is somewhat fun, but extremely simplistic and it wears fast. the lyrics are asinine and moronic, and still don't succeed at being funny. there are only 2 decent tracks. i left this cd in the trunk of a friend s car and as far as i'm concerned, he'll place it under his tire when he gets stuck in snow or sand. believe me, listen to it before you buy it, i didn't and it cost me 13 bucks."
4,"Fun music - superior to ""It's Great When You're Straight Yea","I normally do not seek out this type of music (it's sort of rave-meets-funk-meets soul), though I DO love soul and funk. However, it was recommend to me by a friend and I found it to be fantastic. I've docked it a star only because it's not a CD I couldn't live without, but it IS bloody good! The grooves ARE sloppy, but definitely funky, which, I believe is the whole point. It's funk through extreme inebriation. Danceable, fun, and groovy. Plus, being a Yank, hearing a stoned Northern Englander caterwaul over the beats is a pretty unique and humorous change of pace from most product out there. Highly recommended!"
4,More of Ryder's infectious puerile boogie for your booty...,"Amazing - nothing like it anywhere - If you like your music neat and pressed, forget about this album, otherwise, check out the schizoid party fun sound -What the pro's say:[...]"
2,Stupid is as stupid does,"I bought this disc based on hearing the single ""Get Higher,"" which is laden with catchy hooks and features some rather clever sampling of a Ronald Reagan speech. Unfortunately, the album as a whole does not live up to the standards set by this song. The disc has its undeniably catchy moments, such as ""Rubber Band"" and ""Squeaky"" (which doesn't appear to be on this amazon version of the CD), and Ryder's delivery of the lyrics has a certain charm, due mostly to Happy Mondays nostalgia, but for the most part the songs are lyrically vapid, pointless, and, well, pretty stupid. It's like an entire album of throw-away novelty songs: one may be amusing for its ability to take a dumb idea like a sex-crazed dad and extend it into an entire song, but ten of them in a row? It's more than my attention span can bear. They sound like they had fun recording it, but there's a lack of creativity and originality here that makes this a very forgettable CD."
3,Careful if you have cats!,"While I find these storage boxes to be perfect for what I want, my cats, who love plastic, won't stop licking and nibbling them. I understand that many cats have this issue, so if you know your cats to be plastic lovers, you might want to chew-se another type."
3,Perfectly Good Product,"I found these boxes to be useful and reasonably priced. There is a lot of talk about them being ""flimsy."" My take is that the get a lot of their structural integrity from the CDs they hold. The important thing to know is that a full box is very stable. A partially-full box will not be as stable.The assembly instructions could be better, but once you get the hang of it, they go together quickly. It's something you can do while watching TV."
3,Flimsy,"The other reviewers were right. The boxes are translucent plastic that is very flimsy. If you have one filled with cds and then tape it shut you're unlikely to have a problem. However, if you want to be able to get in and out of the boxes, that's not really an option. The lid of one of mine broke during assembly, so be very gentle with the plastic and attentive to the directions. The company had excellent customer service and sent me a comparable replacement box super fast at no charge. Just know that you're getting very, VERY cheap boxes."
1,Organizers,I was very dispointed in this item. They are hard to assemble and very flimsy. They bend with the pressure of items stored in them.
2,CD organizer boxes,They are a bit flimsy and I probably would not have ordered them if I had seen them first.
2,Not terribly well-written.,"The book provides some useful information, but is written in such a way that the novice will find impossible to follow. The introductory chapters are particularly atrocious, and plunged right into the middle of things without so much as defining the terms and explaining the basic concepts.But for someone who already knows the basics of futures trading, this can be a useful summary of the various markets."
1,Not a good book!,"I read this book trying to learn something about the futures market but Mr. Wassendorf apparently knows next to nothing about how to really make money in the markets. He comes off sounding arrogant, self-centered and otherwise out-of-touch. From his biography, he doesn't have any formal training in economics or the markets, and it shows. Bad deal."
5,"a great, informative book","this book, gilbert's first, collects his writings from the more twenty years of his incarceration. everything from book reviews to interviews to reflective pieces fill this wonderful book.many people will remember gilbert from sam green's documentary on the weather underground. his warmth and grace came through the screen, and he brings the same humility, passion for social justice, and sharp intellect to this book. he self-critically analyzes the movements he was a part of while still offering hope that progressive change can happen. a powerful and important book. may be available from independent distributors such as AK Press, if you can't find it here."
2,a huge disappointment,"I was expecting this game to rock .... The controls are unresponsive. The sense of speed is nonexsitent and makes me wonder why they even put the turbo button in the game in the first place. The graphics are lackluster and there aren't many options (there are only 3 modes to the whole game). However the courses ... are cool b/c they are so large and unique. Nevertheless, I seriously suggest renting this one first and definitely play Splashdown before buying."
4,buy this game as soon as possible,The first time I played this game it was so fun and I couldn't get away from it. This game is so fun. The first day I played it i couldn't get away from it because it was so fun.The only thing wrong with it is there aren't enough characters to chose from and there isn't enough tracks.
2,It just got too boring and repetetive...,"Superman The Man of Steel seemed like a super game at first. It controls well, has decent graphics, and has all of Superman's powers. However, I didnt even finish this game, since it got so boring and repetitive. It had great potential, but every misson feels the same, and they all are. They are all basically ""go to point a and destroy those robots"". And after you destroy those robots in point A, it makes you go to point B,and over again. You can fight villans though. If you are a hardcore fan of Superman comics and stuff, you may enjoy this. But I can say that I didnt. It could have been so good too. Its the most authentic Superman game i've ever played, and probably the best one ever. Thats not saying very much though, considering Superman's dark videogame history..."
3,boring,"it was just boring they need to stop making superman games were you prevent disasters and make a fun one i hate stoping robots from destoying things it should be crimeanil,s you fight not robots if you like destoying robots buy it other wise get a spider man game there worth the money"
1,"great potential, but horrible controls","the controls are devastating to this game. Ofcourse if you play it long enough, you will somewhat get the hang of it, but that's ridiculous. if you're flying, there is one way to go up and down, but if you're standing still, its another way and one way is inverted while the other isn't. Its extremely frustrating.I am a big superman fan, but this is too much. the graphics are cool, kind of comic book style and the powers are nice, but the contols just kill this game."
3,Better For Fans of Superman,"Man of Steel is a pretty fun game, it isn't easy. Besides the flying being hard to master, the gameplay itself can be difficult and notjust because robots are always shooting at you. It does have a nice variety of tasks to do in some of the missions. In one mission alone you have to; save a building from robots, put out a fire, rescue a man from a building, chase a car, defuse a bomb and that is just the start.The graphics are definitely dated now, especially the FMV cut scenes. However, the in-game play doesn't look half bad. Overall, the game is fun, but once again not easy. Overall, I guess I'd recommend it, but mainly to Superman fans. Other people would just find it not worth the time and effort to play the game."
3,Cool Game,This game was bought as a present for my younger brother. He really enjoyed the game and is a big Superman fan. He had fun playing the game.
1,Worst game ever!,Plays like superman needs to goto an AA meeting! Hard to control and try putting the 3 towers on the 3 roofs! Try Wolenstein or HALO!
4,Gamers will enjoy Superman,"As an adult who enjoys video games, mostly war games, I really enjoyed this Superman game. I think alot of people are to tough on their reviews of games and this one as well.I played the first two levels and found out when I truned off the game, that I had enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to the entire game.I think it's to easy to be critical of a game that got a so-so review to begien with. But concerning this game i had fun flying around and using all of Superman's powers. For people who enjoy tough games and for those who enjoy a fun video game, I think will enjoy Superman."
1,Unfulfilled,"Ordered two dozen softballs, they send me two individual balls. I called to report the mistake, and was told that they would send out two dozen right away. Then I got an email a few days later saying they couldn't fill the order at all."
2,Softballs,Be careful I bought theses in all good faith poor info on ad they were a good price but a weird compression rate so cannot use them
3,Could have been better....,"This games story is great, but unfortunately the game play is not. The prgrammer for this game should be ashamed of themselves, they didnt do a very good job with the movement graphics. When Spyro stands still, everything around him moves smoothly. But as soon as Spyro moves, the graphics get glitchy, and sometimes the backround disappears...causing him to fall and lose a life. I really think that if Insomniac (Spyros Original developer) had made this game or something similar, it would have been better for the series. I basically only got the gamecube version because it doesn't take long to load between levels, and the graphics seem to run a little better....but most of all, Spyro is my favorite game character, so I only own it basically for sentimental reasons."
3,Short & Easy,"This game is fun...when the camera is acting right. I thought it was just me, but after reading through some of the other reviews, I'm glad to know that I wasn't being crazy. That is one of the biggest problems with the game. I also didn't like that it was so short. Playing for just a few hours will get you more than 50% through. But other than that it is a very fun game to play. I LOVE Spyro, but I had to give it 3 stars for these reasons:Cons:--too short--too easy (and I can't believe I'm complaining. The others are easy, but not like this, it's ridiculous.)--camera is glitchy (which makes for very frustrating gameplay)--disturbing long load times--no extra lives for flamming extra fodder (and you need them with that horrible camera)Pros:--the graphics & music are great--the plot is tolerable--Spyro Rocks--it's easy for those gaming-challenged individuals--it's fun"
2,Not as good as playstation 1 spyro,I love Spyro for PS1 and the only reason I wanted PS2 was for Spyro. Thank goodness I have found other games because this one is not good at all. Spyro's reaction and walking is slower and doesn't move as smoothly as the PS1 versions do. I didn't even want to continue playing the game so my 4 year old son plays it now and it even makes him mad at times. I would not recommend this game for anyone who truly loves Spyro and is used to playing him on PS1.
1,I hated this game!,"I have always enjoyed the other games, but this one suck. In the other games you visited other worlds, and had really great challenges. But this was only in one little world, and hardly any levels or challenges. I would suggest you not get this game. It was really bad. The only thing that was good was the change in the quality of the graphics compared to the other games, and the extra special powers that Spyro gets. But to be honost, it's not worth having. I mean I beat this game in half a day and I like games that are challenging and take some time to accomplish. Not something that you can beat in half a day. Don't waist your time or money on this game. It isn't worth it."
1,Very boring and easy,"This is the worst game ever, definately not a good game. Kids may like it a little, but if you all are 10 and over dont buy this. This is the easiest game ever and incredibly BORING. Trust me, this is not worth buying, and if you get it, go trade it in at Gamestop, I got 11 dollars for it and I got it for 10 dollars at Massachusetts."
4,My 4 year old loves it,"My 4 year old is really enjoying this game, I like the way that most characters speak the instructions (although one is intelligible to us) since my son can't read yet. The violence is mild enough to consider this appropriate for some children (you are playing a flame breathing dragon that has to eat and attack!) The GameCube implementation is a little rough, but not so bad that kids won't tolerate it. We rented this for a week, after the week, we may buy it if my son is still interested..."
1,Don't waste your money,"This game is nowhere near as fun as its predecessors. The game is pathetically short, and each level is a sad approximation of level designs from the previous Spyro games. Game play is ridiculously easy; no challenge whatsoever. I'm not sure that it's even worth renting.Stick to the first three!"
2,Bad Port for GC,"If you're going to play Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly on a GameCube, I'd rent it and have a look at the sub-par porting job...It seems like they took it from the psx driver. The graphics are nice, sure, but the frames jump from 60 to 15 or so. Really really choppy, definately not something you'd expect out of a gamecube. I think Majesco needs to have a talk with their software team. If it was as smooth as a game like...Crazy Taxi for example, it would be an awesome game."
2,Sypro Shoots A Blank,"What ruins this game is the fact that is suffers from numerous programming bugs that make the game look cheap. The game lacks for inspiration in other areas besides graphics. The story is just a rehash of the first adventure, which by the way is a classic game. This Spryro is just as cute, but the game is half as clever. If you missed the first 2 games on Playstation then you have missed the best Spyro has to offer. My advice is skip this game and find yourself a more worthy purchase."
2,Dissapointment,"This spyro game has extremly long load times, you could go out, take a walk, and make a sandwich and when you come back It will still be loading. The sound effects are repetative and the voice-overs are painful. Most of the time I played this game with the sound muted. The music is okay, but it could be better. I don't think I ever reached the 3rd level, It was just too slow for me."
1,this game STUNK!!!!!!,"i wish i could give it 0 stars, but its not a choice. where should i start?? the first level...no comment. the first level took me an hour and i STILL didnt finish it...pointles game!! thats ALL i have to say about it. i was smart and rented it and am i glad i didnt buy it...for those of you who like to be bored...this is the perfect game for you!!"
3,Slow at times,"Overall the game was fun to play. The graphics were amazing and the game was not too easy (like Ripto's Rage) but not too difficult. The only complaint I have is that it is truly a pain to go to a new world. It takes such a long time to load the next world! At first I thought it was my system but after bringing it to a friend's I figured it was just slow, and that is a major bummer. At times it took nearly 3 minutes to load, which is just ridiculous."
3,I miss Insomniac!,"As a Spyro lover, i was really excited to hear of a new spyro coming out, especially on the Gamecube system. Unfortunately, the Gamecube version as well as the Playstation 2 version, seem to be plagued with bugs. Game freezing up, slow frame rate, weird camera angles. I say definately rent before you buy this game."
1,Legendary game -bad conversion...,"I'm a spyro fanatic if the game is on Playstation, but the conversion to GameCube was poorly made. There are just way to many bugs in it. For example while I was playing it froze, couldn't move, couldn't even save. Maybe next time the Spyro team will take their time, not to mention test the game before they release it to the market."
1,Worst Spyro game in the world!!!,"In the comercials they made this game look so awsome and when I got ,IT SUCKED!!!There is only 1 world. This game made Spyro look bad.All the friends I have think this game is the worst game in Spyro history! If you are reading this and you have this game,SELL IT!"
1,Spyro enter the garbage desposal,"Spyro 4 sucks! It freezes up to many times. The breaths are cool, but the game sucks. The plot is stupid. Plus they switched the people who made it. Spyro 2 and 3 I recomend that you get them. Camera angles suck. Camera angles suck. It sucks monkey butt....... Cudos to X Play."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!,"This game is HORIBBLE. There are annoying glitches galore, gameplay is absolutly awful, and the story is stupid. The old Spyros, even though the graphics are a little out dated, are fun and witty. This game is a disgrace (hope this doesn't happen to Ratchet and Clank)."
1,boring with a capital B,"Its very dull,and its the exact same concept as all the other ones. Find gems,kill monsters,collect treasure,save the world from disconfigured sorcerers,bla bla bla."
2,Enter the Dragonfly,"Enter the Dragonfly has good graphics and fun gameplay, but it is not going to be a challenge for experienced players. The characters are often fun and silly, and they constantly bounce up and down in an annoying manner. There are nine levels, and each one has some sort of challenge portal(driving a tank, racing against the clock or rivals, sliding down a slide, etc.). Spyro uses fire, ice, elctric, and bubble elements. He also can use wing shield, charge, and horn dive. For those that do not know, it focuses on puzzles and challenges, not on combat like the Legend of Spyro series. Overall, while it is relatively fun, it will probably be short-lived entertainment for experienced players."
3,Spyro,Had to return product because of malfunction. My son liked it before it froze several times at the same place in the game.
2,"Ugh, Freezes up all the time!","I love almost every apect of this game, except is has a habit of freezeing up especially on challenge boards when you are winning. Personally I like this one the least of all the Spryo's and I love these games!"
2,Beat it in 2 days. NO LIE!,"EASY and Annoying! It take a long time to load and the voice-overs are stupid. The graphics are very good but not for GameCube, it's just better than the old ones. I recomend you wait for a new one to come out because you'll fly right through it. Literally!"
3,Old Spyro gamers will be let down.,"I loved Spyro for PSX. It was so much fun, it lasted a very long time, there were tons of levels, and it was a flat-out great game. So, I was so exited when I saw this game on the shelves. I immediatly got it, looked at the atlas, and whoa-there's less than ten levels? It was also kind of pathetic how they couldn't come up with new ideas; there was too much of the same. It might just be my GCube, but it was really slow. Aside from all that, it's a Spyro game, so it's fun, but nothing in comparison to any of the other games. Sorry Insomniac, but would ya think a little more?"
2,Unfinished product,"There is no way that this game was tested thoroughly before release. I feel robbed! I think that Universal Entertainment owes all Spyro fans a big appology. The frame rates are incredibly slow and nauseating. The story line makes no sense, the game does not flow smoothly. It does not live up to the previous three games. If you want to play a good Spyro game, I suggest you go back to one of the first 3 games."
3,Great fun!,"If you aren't a fan of Spyro you will be after this game. There are many levels where Spyro searches for dragonflies. The music and voice acting is done well. Also the animation is stellar. When spyro moves it looks pretty real. Also, he can shoot ice, electricity, bubles and fire. in all great fun. Playable anytime and by anyone. Good or all ages."
1,Gr,"This game is horrid. It's slow, ridiculously hard is some parts and hard in others, and just horrid. The game play is sketchy, the plot is meaningless, the controls are badly designed... Dont' bother spending your money on this."
4,"Cute Game, But Really Not That Great","I do not reccomend this game to you if you play the Gamecube mostly for the experience of stunning graphics and awesome animation. The character modeling (how every character in the game was drawn up in 3D for the game) it is almost as bad as Nintendo 64. The animation of the charcters is not realistic and there are scenes where characters are walking and they look like they're sliding across the ground.If you want a better visual experience play Super Mario Sunshine, Starfox Adventures, a Need for Speed game, or Sonic Adventure DX"
3,The Fantastic Spyro Games Continue,"Like the past Spyro games, this one doesn't disappoint. When I first began the game I didn't know what to expect, but after messing around with it for a bit it reminded me of the prior games. I like the way it handles and there are new features. besides the main game there are also mini-games. Sometimes I find myself playing the mini-games more then trying to catch all of the dragonflies and ""beat"" the game. The voice acting was good too."
4,spyro,I was a pretty big fan of the others but I must say that this spyro is much better! It has great mini games and the new breath weapons are a breath of fresh air! ahahah Oh and did i mention the music all I have to say is stuart copeland from the police nuff said!
4,this game is adorable,"I love the beautiful graphics and pleasant music in this game. You couldn't ask for a more adorable hero than Spyro. I must warn you though, it isn't so easy as you might expect for a kid game. Many of the dragonflies, essential to advance, are cleverly hidden and the soar and hover movement is a little difficult to master. Spyro is very challenging."
3,Eye protection,I liked them a lot but my dog did not. She scratched them against the stucco to get them off. I think maybe I didn't pick the right size for her. I am willing to try again with a different size cuz I won't let my dog stick her head out the window without goggles.
4,A Very Good Place to Start,"You can't argue with the choices here for excellent postwar Chicago blues. All classics. If it weren't for the longer and more varied ""Blues Masters Volume 2: Postwar Chicago Blues"", I would've voted this 5 stars. Rock and roll was birthed here, baby!"
5,Rice Lover,"Excellent choice! I've purchased several rice cookers in the past. The last one I had was a Tiger Brand which I was very disappointed with. This by far was the best rice cooker I've ever had. We cook rice everyday and although it takes a little longer than the other brands I've used, the rice comes out ""PERFECT"" each time and does not get spoiled easily. One of the best feature is that you can actually see the measurement inside the pot.The pot in itself is heavy duty.It's a little pricy but you get what you pay for and this Zojirushi is definitelyworth the money. It also has two different tunes when you initially press the cooking button and after it's done...very cute! We all love it and will definitely recommend to anyone."
4,Zojirushi Rice Cooker,"I am happy with it since it has warm functionality to keep the rice warm for extended hours. As far as cooking is concerned I dont see any extra ordinary result as mentioned in the reviews. My Aroma rice cooker also used to cook perfectly, the reason to buy this one was due to good reviews and keep warm functionality."
5,Superb Rice Cooker,"This is the best rice cooker I have ever had. I have struggled with making 'good' brown rice for quite some time and really wanted to make the switch to healthier eating. This rice cooker makes the best brown rice I have ever had. My husband agrees. I got a great cookbook through Amazon (The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook), that offers so many more options for using the cooker, but if all I ever did was make brown rice in this cooker, it's been worth the cost. You won't be disappointed with this buy:)"
3,MADE IN CHINA,This cooker is made in China. The description for this product doesn't mention this info. It should be included because there is a big difference about quality of where it is made. I have not used it but definitely will return it and get one that is made in Japan!
5,The Best!,"I love this collection of songs. This is the record that inspired me to learn how to play the guitar. I hadn't gotten this excited about an artist since high school and Joni Mitchell. Her voice and guitar sound the best here - clear, strong and passionate, and IMHO this is the one and only version of ""I Don't Know Why."" I love all her records (except Whole New You) but this is the one I play the most. Try also to get your hands on her 1975 bootlegs. They're very sweet."
5,A rare find that I play to death,"I first heard Shawn Colvin's Live '88 album on the public television station SBS in Australia. I had never heard of Shawn and ordered the album as soon as I had listened to two songs. Live '88 displays an artist at her best, just a singer and her guitar. It is a beautiful simple and moving CD. This artist has inspired me."
4,"""Live '88"", ""Steady On"" Live","I love Shawn Colvin, her sound is fresh, creative and original. Live 88' does not disappoint on any of these counts. However, having listened to Steady on for many years, I thought Live 88' might be the raw version - it is not. This set is polished and very, very similar to the studio recording. If you are a collector or unfamiliar with the Steady On album, Live 88' is well worth having. If you are looking for something new from an old favorite, you will be disappointed."
2,A Questionable Read,"This is the textbook we are using for a graduate level class in cultural and social diversity. I am actually amazed that my university chose this text. The tone that the author sets is cynical at best. On one hand, the need to be culturally competent is being heartily emphasized, but he is also stressing almost religiously that this is the way things are and probably will remain. If this is the case, why even study cultural and social diversity--to just check the block and say we're trying to do better? Another thing that bothers me is that much of the research in this text is not updated for this to be a 2007 edition. Statistics from the 1980s or early 1990s? I am glad for one thing though, this is only an eight-week course."
3,Super Reader,"A spinoff of Jerry Cornelius, if you like, where his sister features prominently, as does Una Persson, who pops up in several other places.Jerry perhaps is well out of it, as their mother also shows here, and he would be well outnumbered in gender.More wild antics, and of course some antics of the s*xual variety."
2,"Maybe it's just me, but...","...are all of Moorcock's books (except the Eternal Champion series) very, very bad? The writing feels like it is first written down, then processed through a book of synonyms.The story itself is fun enough I guess, but the writing makes it hard to follow. Maybe if I had read of Una Persson or Catherine Cornelius before it would make more sense. This feels like the third volume in a five-volume series."
3,The Christmas Feast by Peggy Webb,"Description from the book back cover:A holiday to remember ... This Christmas, Jolie O'Banyon planned to impress her family with the feast of a lifetime. But just as she realized she could use a few cooking lessons, the world's sexiest man broke into her family's manor. Only, this hunk was no burglar. He was her sister's surprise guest - and he knew how to heat things up in the kitchen ... When Special Agent Lance Estes showed up early at the O'Banyon's, he wasn't expecting to have to make nice with an adorably inept chef - not that he minded. But a man who courted danger for a living had no business making promises to a woman. Especially a woman like Jolie, who deserved the best a man had to offer ..."
1,WELCOME TO THE BUNGLE,This is the movie that does disservice to cannibal movies. Four of the stupidest college-age kids venture into the jungle of New Guinea in the hopes of solving the mystery of the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller in 1961. They meet up with a friendly bunch of natives who actually hand a cigarette lighter with Rockefellers initials to our quartet of dopes. Huh?Twice in the movie each couple construct a raft and as they are floating along they become nervous when they see an increasing crowd of seemingly hostile natives carrying spears and bow and arrows. So what do our genius's do? They dock the raft onshore and start running through the jungle with the cannibals in hot pursuit. What????So the obvious happens. They get eaten and the cannibals get indigestion.
3,Worthy addition to the cannibal genre,"First off this is not a remake of Cannibal Holocaust. Not even close. Cannibal Holocaust is known for its over the top depictions of violence and gore. This film is very subtle and tame by comparison. In fact, this film is much more similar to the ""Blair Witch Project"" in it visual style and dramatic unfolding of events. Some viewers will be disappointed that no one gets eaten, decapitated, raped, or eviscerated in this film. And the killings occur mostly off camera. So what makes this film worth watching? Its the expert character development that occurs in the first 3/4 of the film. The two couples that take a trip to New Guinea to search for fame and fortune become so grating and unlikable halfway through the film that the veiwer can't wait for them to get theirs. When they do start to get picked off it is a catharsis for the viewer."
1,please god make it stop,"memo to the universe HAND HELD CAMERA SHOTS ARE CRAP. THEY WERE CRAP IN THE PAST, THEY ARE CRAP NOW, AND THEY WILL BE CRAP IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO MAKE A FILM WITHOUT THIS STUPID GIMMICK DO NOT MAKE THE FILM. I AM WARNING YOU AND I MEAN IT. DO NOT MAKE ME HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF BECAUSE I WON'T BE."
1,waste of time and money,"I've been watching for well over an hour and nothing has happened except stupid juvenile back and forth banter. The kids shout each others' names to irritating excess and in that situation you wouldn't keep shouting ""COLBY!"" like a broken record when there's nobody else for miles around except for Colby as far as you know and he's standing right there in front of your face in the jungle. And if there were someone else it might not be friendly. This is a real amateur swindle-job by people who don't seem to have ever gone outside on a hike. Don't buy it."
1,....terrible,"one of the worst films ive ever seen seriously dont waste yer time on this, im not sure how anyone whos rated this movie wrote more than a paragraph of review, this simply is a movie of stupidity and bad filmography/storyline."
1,Mini spool,Part looks great! Speedy delivery. I ordered it thinking it was a regular spool. This needs to be labeled a MINI SPOOL and also needs to be labeled for a28 SPINE. Thank you for your time
3,"I know what I must play, but I am afraid to play it!","Ok this game is just like the cartoon, tom bombadil is in it which makes it kinda cool and the fighting is great too but this isn't what makes the game well how do you say different. It has a different type of way of playing i mean it's noit every day you find a game that is just like the book i mean please. They could of saved they're time and made a hobbit game i mean the missions are difficult the game play is soso. It's too damn dark and the riders in black scare the helll out of me. so if your ready for a messed up version of J.R.R Tolkien's the fellowship of the rings go right aheadby the way you can be gandalf and aragorngandalf casts spells and aragorn kicks..."
4,Read this!,"Okay, let me start that I'm not a great gamer. But I do know when someone puts time into making a game. From beggining to end its great fun. Fighting trolls as Aragon, slipping past Ringwraiths as Frodo and casting spells as Gandalf. The realism could be better to make it tougher or harder, you get shot with arrows about 10 times before you die. And it takes about a million hits to beat some guys. And I'm asking to much but I wish now that there was a direction arrow or something. It would cut off about an hour in the mines of Moria. And I wish that you could look at your goals after they show them so you dont forget them. But seriously, this is a great game. Its a must have for anyone who likes action/adventure. Who doesnt? Its my favorite game after all the games I've played. It even made me want to read the book! Talk about perfect transfer from book to game. Tolkien would be proud."
5,Great adaptation!,"This version of LOTR is a great adaptation from the book (not the movie, in case anyone didn't know). I didn't know until I was about to buy it, but since I was a big fan of the books I decided to take the plunge, if you will. It's a great version even if you haven't read the book - that way there's elements you haven't seen before, and the whole thing isn't too predictable. As can be expected, the gameplay is excellent, as are the graphics and sound. I tried the TTT version for PS2, but i got kinda thrown off by the fact that you like live the movie for the first half hour of the game. The FOTR version for PS2 is definitely my choice."
5,Worth The Money,"The price for this game is very good! The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring PS2 game has great graphics, sound, gameplay, and a wonderful storyline. This game is very entertaining and its worth the money to buy it."
3,game kept me entertained,"...the game was quite good. i started playing it with the mindset that it wasn't going to be good, but after the first little part where you don't fight, it is very entertaining and it requires some serious skill at points. like someone else said, you cannot expect to beat this one in less than a day.... or at least it would be tough. anyway, if you don't like this game, buy the the two towers because that one is a for sure hit!"
2,Not your money's worth,"To say it bluntly, this game blows...seriously. You would think they would work extra hard for such a great movie but no. It was an extremely short game, absolutely unchallenging and boring. I think i've said enough...if you're considering getting this game, trust me and look for something else, you'll thank me later."
4,Just for fun. . .,"The first thing that caught me about this game was the characters look NOTHING like they do in the movies. . . NOTHING. This didn't really upset me too much though. The game is a quick and challenging game. It took me 2 days to beat it. There is a trick to almost everything you do and fight. You get to be Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf(Gandalfs the best!). You can use magic with Gandalf, use a LONG sword and bows with Aragorn, and you can put on the Ring with Frodo. You battle people wolves and a multiple # of cave trolls and Orcs. Now I know this doesn't amazing but it's fun while it lasts. The graphics are pretty good if the characters looked like that in the movie. But this is a game to rent. You'll beat it too quickly. Although I highly recommend the second game, The Lord Of the Rings The Two Towers, that's also fun. So this is not the best game but it is fun."
3,Okay...,"This game is definitely meant for fans of Tolkein's text. It is somewhat entertaining, but extremely frustrating in parts! For example, it takes hours to get out of the Shire as Frodo, and as Gandalf it is easy to get lost in the maze of Moria. I probably enjoyed playing as Aragorn the most (although Gandalf's spells were fun!) but because Bree was so dark it was difficult to find all of the needed items quickly."
2,Saruman?,where was Saruman? this could be the lamest game i ever played. i beat it in 3 hours. sad huh?
1,boring,"this game is boring. in the beginning, all u do is run around as frodo lookin 4 stuff. when u actually get 2 fight the gameplay stinx anyway. the 2 towers is a whole lot better."
1,HUGE disappointment,"Kraft must have developed this game because it's totally cheezy. DO NOT spend money on this. If you think you must play it, rent it. Frankly, I rented it and I'm depressed that I paid Blockbuster $5.99, it wasn't even worth that. Game play is completely boring and campy. If you're a LOTR fan, play Two Towers by EA. It is 1000 times better than this. It has exciting, challenging, pulse-racing game play as opposed to this snooze-fest. Two Towers has actual movie clips throughtout and even has cast interviews that you unlock after beating levels. The movie cast does the character voices and the characters look quite a bit like the actors. In FOTR, they are cartoony imitation people. The whole thing is incredibly lame.I supposed if I hadn't of played Two Towers, this game might have been better. But after seeing how EA did it, this leaves a LOT to be desired. I definately say rent, don't buy."
1,Thoroughly Disgusting,"After waiting for 30 minutes to get through opening dialogue and the never-ending loading screens, I was relieved that there actually was a game part to this... until I started playing. The play control is revolting, the characters look like walking dolls. Oh yeah, and after trying 7 times to get past the OPENING SECTION (a.k.a. getting past the Dark Riders), I failed to get past the Gamgee land. No matter where you go, the damn thing sees you and you lose. I'm glad I only rented it instead of spending hard earned money on the worst PS2 game I've EVER played. I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemy."
2,dont buy this game,"this game was a great dissapointment. although you got to play three different characters there were no special moves and the whole game was not challenging whatsoever. there are parts that have nothing to do with the book, and it took me about 3 hours to beat the game. it's not worth 50.00. so dont buy this game."
1,"Horrible game, avoid at all costs....","Wow, what a let down. Here's the short version.1. Horrible control. Very awkward, especially the camera. Worst camera I've seen in a game like this in a long long long time.2. Short/small/linear. Laughably short. I beat this game in 5 hours. No cheats, no hints,....so short, so easy, just.... laughable.Go buy/rent Drakan the Ancients gate. Uses a similar engine (the good parts done by surreal), but just a much much much better game, in every way imaginable.I certainly wouldn't recommend buying this, and I be hard pressed to even recommend renting it, it's not even worth the 6 bucks it cost to rent....what a let down, avoid at all costs."
5,dude has anyone compared the two PS2 games???,"hey y'all - this game is so much fun! wow, i'm so impressed. i totally didn't know what to expect, but what do you know, it's freakin amazing! the game is nuts! the music and sounds are off the hook, and the graphics are absolutely astounding. i had no idea that this is based off the the book, which i think is kinda cool. i haven't read the book, but now i think i might because it seems like there's a lot they didn't put in the movie. also, i don't want to play the TTT game before i see the movie, so i'll wait until they release the book version of TTT before i go out and buy it."
1,Not Even For Free,"I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out. If I waited a month (which I wished I did) I could've bought it for $20. This has to be by far one of the worst games I ever played. Needless to say I played it for about 45 minutes and quit, I never played it again. I thought it was boring, graphics and movement were terrible. Honestly if someone gave me this game for free I wouldn't take it. I love the books, all 3 movies were great, this game shouldn't exist. I wasn't too impressed with the other Lord of the Rings Games either but this one is definately the worst out of all. Try to avoid this one at all cost."
1,nothing to say,"due to word limitation, I cannot write down every complaint about this game so heres my short short review....It [bites], dont waste your money on the piece of [crud], you want the feel of the adventure read the book, this game is a rip off, i played it, beat it under 4 hours, I didnt even want to give it 1 star but amazon made me. spend your hard earned money on something better. this...this is junk."
3,...,"OK. This game is fun until you have to be gandolf. He has magic that doesnt kill, a [mostly ineffective] sword, and hes [very] slow ... Aragorn however is great fun to play even though they should have used Viggo's real voice. Frodo is just plain annoying. For the most part because his weapon is a small stick. I personally suggest buying or renting Two Towers. It lets you choose your charachter and theres no ""sneaking"". If you do wish to play this game because your an avid tolkien fan then do yourself a favor and rent it. Or if not then get Two Towers. This game is full of pointless deeds and really annoying combat which is very hard to get accostumed to. Personally i think they should have used the actors real voices like TT. I hope this helps you make your decision."
5,"more story than game, but still fun","this game was so much fun. it was in the right style for lord of the rings. there is more story than game play to it, but that's what makes it more enteresting. this game rocks."
2,One word... Disappointing,"This game is not very good. The graphics are cheesy, the voices of original actors aren't there like in Two Towers. The plot is dumb. A whole bunch of loading just within one level. And you get unlimited ammo, so it's not challenging at that aspect. I played this at my friend's house 'cause I thought about buying it. DON'T WASTE YOUR $20 ON THIS! Rent it maybe. The only cool things are 1: You can wear The Ring, and 2: You can be Gandalf. Get the Two Towers instead, you play part of the Fellowship on that one anyway!"
1,this game []really deserves 0 stars,"This game had so much potential, but didn't come near it. Gandalf was a fun character to play, but he didnt last long. I beat this game in about 3-4 hours. It was just way to easy and the controls were pretty scratchy. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Some of the graphics were pretty sweet, but it was inconsistent. I accidnetly bought this game thinking it was the 2 towers, now I dont know if I will even get that game"
1,Greatest disappointment ever for an expensive game.,"This is the first game that I bought for the PS2.I expected much more from a 2nd generation console-game.The graphics were average.But most of all, the game is too short. I finished the game in about four hours. The game is not challenging hard, in other words too easy.Especially at the beginning of the game the events start happening really slowly. (get the note from the chest, bring them to bla bla) Too easy puzzles, etc.It looks like this game was developed within a month.I am usually not so critical, but this game doesn't get my credits... waste of money. (sorry)"
2,"Buy ""Two Towers"" instead!","This is a very mediocre game based on the book. You will probably enjoy reading the book much more than playing this game. If you want a ""Lord of the Rings"" game, I highly recommend ""The Two Towers"" which is much better."
2,BORING,"I was expecting something better from a Tolkien Game. This junky gameplay could not be worse! But lets take it one thing at a time. Well, the blood was cheesy, the singing was annoying, and the quests were pointless and annoying! The two stars was for the okay graphics. Good thing i only rented it..."
2,eh?,The only thing that was really fun in this game was killing Orcs or whatever but the game definetely wasnt as bad as some say. Seems this one was aimed more to a young audience. The movie wasnt very good either so I guess they go together.
1,Bored of the Rings,The Lord of the Rings:The Felloship of the Ring would personally not be my choice. I completed the game in two days without difficulty dying only once. One of the worst games I have played the two towers I completed in the same time most of the Lord of the Rings games are crap so I'm bored of these damn rings.
1,Really Bad!!!!!!!,I hate this game. The only reason I have it is because when I bought a Spyro game it was free. I played it probably 8 times before I found out its was boring and impossible to beat. I have never been a fan of Lord of the Ring but i thoght the game would be ok. I was wrong. It was horrible. I have never played it in over 1 year. Even if you are a big fan of Lord of the Rings I think your going to find this game boring and stupid.Please tell me if my reveiw was helpful or not.
2,Ummmmmmmmmmmmm......,"Well, I'll be honest and I haven't even been able to get out of the shire. THE *bad word* BLACK RIDERS ALLWAYS CATCH YOU! I gave this game a two simply because it might've gotten better had I not given up after 20 tries, but trust me, don't get this game if you're like me and have no patience."
2,A weekend renter,"Actually, rent two games, because you'll finish this one in under 3 hours, and won't want to play it again (NO REPLAY VALUE WHATSOEVER!!!). There's enough to keep you fairly entertained for that time period, but boring battles, lame bosses, and an overall lack of challenge will make you wish you had looked deeper than that ""official"" Tolkien product. Another complaint that I have is the lack of autosave at the end of each mission. The fact that this game so religiously follows the book and works some of the minor passages into entire levels saved me from rating this game a 1.This game is perfect for people too lazy to read the first book in the trilogy, but who want to see all the stuff that got left out of Peter Jackson's first LOTR film. Even so, my advice to you is this: save yourself [some money]by going to see The Two Towers instead of buying this game. You'll be far more entertained."
2,Rental Only,"After beating this game in one night, i realized that i had basically wasted my time. The game can be fun at times, but not often. Aragorn is fun, but he is lacking combat moves. If you're a fan of the movie as well as the book, i would recommend this game as no more than a rental. This game claims to be based off the book, but there are lots of lines, word for word, from the movie, and there are many levels and tasks that aren't in the book or the movie. Bottom line, if your looking for a good LOTR game, buy the Two Towers. It's much more fun."
2,"Glitches Galore, Did Not Like.",The game had so many glitches that I couldn't even play for more than two hours. I couldn't even get past one part of the game.
2,3 films of a cult series,"Tenchy is nowadays a cult title among the comedy/harem series made in the 1990s.Although not familiar with that series the films are professionally made. But in my opinion, it lacks really good humour; there are attempts, but those only raise a smile. The harem element only is obvious in the second movie.The movies are not that impressive, in the end. Sometimes you wonder, who is who and why are they doing this. More for the fans of the series, I think."
