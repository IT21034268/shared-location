3,Early Prince,Very interesting stuff to hear if you want to get a ear glimpse of what was to become. (Prince fans can tell its him too)
3,Enter Whining [Audio Cassette],"Though I would've liked it better if the audio were in CDs but nontheless it was quite good and clear and in Fran's voice which make it much better. What I didn't like was the cover!! it isn't like the one in the picture, and it looks so dirty and used."
5,She is a person enjoys.,I watched THE NANNY and I like her performance a lot then I read this I know that show is the real her.
5,FRAN FANTASTIC.. FABULOUS.. LOVELY,"I LOVED THIS BOOK ""ENTER WHINING"", FRANS BOOK IS FANTASTIC.FRAN IS ARE WONDERFULL ACTRESS,FUNNY, BEAUTIFUL,SEXY AND VERY GOOD TO EVERYTHING""WRITER DIRECTOR,PRODUCER""FRAN HAVE A WONDERFULL SMILE, WHEN I LOOK FRAN'S PICTURE,I MAKE SO HAPPY.I READ AND READ THIS BOOK.

5,Wonderful reading,"Fran Drescher is a treasure for the American public and in this memoir, she bares her soul about her life, her series and friends and family.She wears her heart on her sleeve and it is obvious in this book which is good reading. She makes you feel as if you have known her all your life.Don't miss this!"

5,I Luved the Book,"This is the best book I have eva read! I usually don't read but when I got this book I could not put it down! This is a funny and facinatiang book on how ""the flashy girl from Flushing"" went from and ordinary person to a sitcom writer. I have two words for you: READ IT!"
5,DRESCHER IS A DELIGHT!,FRAN OWN CHARISMA AND CHARM IS ALL HER OWN-EVEN IN HER WRITING!READ ABOUT HER RISE TO STARDOM ALONG WITH FUNNY AND HILARIOUS QUIPS(ALONG WITH THE OCCASIONAL CUSS WORD
4,Great product,I really love this. It can be a bit soft so you have to use it lightly or it will clump on your eye. Other than that it's great.
2,Smudgy,"I thought this would be a good product because it's from Sephora. I LOVE Sephora products. But when I put this on, it was really smudgy, and almost globby. I was disappointed."
2,Hard to apply,"The colors of these pencils are very pretty but they are very hard to apply. You have to press hard on your eyelid to get the color on. Also, they really pull on the eyelid. I won't re-order."
4,Sephora Brand Slim Pencil,I love the color of the eye pencil and it is long lasting. The pencil could stand to be a little bit softer though..you really have to get rough with it to get the color lash lines.
2,Just OK,"I know these are cheap little pencils actually perfect for your purse but they don't seem to stay on for me. I will probably stick to what I have been using in the past.thanks,TR"
2,"true color, hard to apply","The colors are very nice and true to what was shown on-line. The pencil is a bit too hard for a smooth application and it smears when my eyes tear. I tried using a powder over the liner to ""set it"" but it still tends to run. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Great Alternative to Wood Fire,"We like this unit, a bit thirsty for propane but no wood smoke odor anymore. Could not be easier to use. Legs fold under unit for storage and slips into its zippered bag nicely. The amount of lava rocks included are about twice as many as needed...so don't use all of 'em. We use a 2.5 gal. portable tank vs. the disposable type and get maybe three evenings of fire/use out of it. Gas line provided could be a few feet longer."
5,A must-have!,"Camping isn't camping without a fire in the evenings. Unfortunately due to forest fires there is often a campfire ban. My husband did some research and discovered the Camp Chef Portable Campfire. What a find!! It worked beautifully and provided the ""campfire"" experience we were looking for. We popped popcorn, roasted marshmallows, told stories and talked until the wee hours around our Camp Chef! Fuel consumption was very reasonable! On the rainy cold days it provided enough heat to dry out sleeping bags and blankets in the camp shelter. We were so thankful we purchased the Camp Chef. A camper's must-have!"
3,No Logs,"I have not tested out this product, but the description of the items included is incorrect. Description says ""Includes a base, high-pressure burner, 5 ceramic logs, 8 pounds of lava rock, and convenient carrying bag."" NOTE - There are NO LOGS included, at least I did not get any. It looks like it would work fine, but if that is the effect you are going for, don't buy this. Come on Amazon, update your description of the product! Now that I am reading the reviews, it seems several people have had this issue and others not. Maybe there are multiple products being sold under the same name?"
5,Portable campfire,"We bought this for us to use in Arizona when there are no burn seasons due to dry weather. Worked out great, even got to cook on top of it. Uses alot of fuel though when on high flame."
4,Camp Chef Gas Fire Ring,"We love ours! We had been using a chimneria, but didn't like the smoke and ashes. This fire ring is very clean and simple to use. Instant on, instant off. Flames are about 4 inches tall, so it's a great cozy fire for your patio. The burner is heavy duty and so are the supporting legs. It's good quality.If I had a huge trophy home on the lakeside, I'd go for something fancier, but for a simple patio outdoor fire, this is pretty good.We also really like the fact that you can turn it off instantly and not worry about glowing embers or fire danger after you've gone inside for the night."
4,Camp Chef Portable Campfire,"Pros: Puts out a fair amount of heat, has a nice even flame and very quick and convenient for cooking hot dogs, smores, etc. over an open flame. Also, it stows well in its own sturdy carrying bag and is half the price of the 'Campfire in a Can'. Con: There is no easy way to disconnect the gas hose from the Campfire bowl."
3,Fire pit,"Seems to work as explained, but after the first use for some reason the flow of gas has slowed down. We kept opening valve but no more propane would enter burner causing a very low flame."
5,a book for all seasons,This book is easy and enjoyable to read and at the same time offers simple truths for success. The title says it all. The best part is that it can be referenced as we transition through the changing seasons of our lives.It is as good for a high school student pondering a career as it is for someone considering a second or third career. Mainly it offers everyone that reads it the guidelines for a happy and meaningful life.
4,"Fun, fun, fun!!!","A bit of slapstick, a bit of schtick, a bit of fun.....old time writing and setting, but lots of fun, nontheless."
1,Not autographed!,"Great book! I love Dortmunder series. The problem is, i have this book in soft cover, the only reason i bought this one is because it said it's Autographed copy, But the one i received wasn't autographed! Not nice Amazon!"
3,"It was very interesting,and passionate",It was a lovely book but was a bit too revealing and descriptive especially for younger readers.
1,5 for the movie 1 for this product,"Be aware the movie itself is great, 5 stars definitely, however this version is awful; nothing about the picture quality has been improved, there are no special features. It's literally just an overpriced version of the original material."
4,Pretty Good Special Features,"I had already gotten this product before I saw the negative reviews that have been posted so I was a bit worried about it. Upon delivery, I found that the picture quality was good and the special features were interesting.There is a picture gallery with posters from the movie release as well as some interesting shots of Leni Riefenstahl who shows some SKIN in this film...VERY NICE BODY...There is also a film about the city of Berlin that is interesting to watch.All in all I am pleased."
1,"""Shockingly Bad Photography"" would be more like it","A short disclaimer: I did not read through the text of this book, as the quality of the photography was so disturbing it rendered the writing irrelevent.This book will be returned as soon as the post office opens tomorrow. I had purchased it as a gift and cannot, in good conscience, pass it on to the intended recipient.The gardens pictured are exquisite and had the quality of the photos been equal to their composition, this book would be an inspiration to gardeners everywhere. Unfortunately, the photographs are grainy, soft (read 'blurry'), and lacking any depth-of-field whatsoever. Using these substandard images to represent years of dedication by talented gardeners is insulting both to the reader as well as the garden owners.In a world full of lovely landscapes and brilliant photographers, this book does justice to neither."
4,twin towers,"I ordered this book for my 6 1/2 year old son who is facinated with the Towers. Nice pictures of the WTC from its early days and building, and tastefully done pictures of its sad destruction. The pictures are taken from all over the New York Metropolitan area emphasizing their past domination of New York's signature sky line. Very little prose other than picture identification, and my son can spend hours pouring over the pictures. I would have appreciated a few more close up shots and interior picture and views, but all in all, a nicely done memoir."
2,Not what it appears to be,"Unlike the MCSE Readiness Review for 'Networking Essentials', this book fails to prepare you for the 70-067 exam that it is named after. After taking the practice exam for the 'Networking Essentials' MCSE Readines Review and making a 90%, I took the actual exam and was pleased to see questions on the same content. Naturally, I also scored high on the exam. After studying this book and making a 95% on the practice test, I was extremely disappointed to find that the real exam dealt with very little of the content found in this book. In fact, I would have to say that after mastering this book, I was quite *un-prepared* for the 70-067 exam. ( and it cost $100 to find out )"
2,Microsoft Windows NT Server 4 Readiness Review,"I have read reviews that state how people often overlook the real purpose of this book, but I have to disagree. On the back cover it states ""If you took the MCP exam 70-067 today would you pass?"" It also goes on to say that the book teaches you what to focus on for the exam. I am afraid that you can't just read the title and give a review. Those who have studied this book, understand it's contents and taken the exam will know better. This book is a good supplement to a good study guide, but certainly does not gauge how well you would do on the exam. I even seems to stay away from leading you to realistic exam questions at times."
2,Windows NT Server 4 Readiness Review,"This book leads me to believe that Microsoft REALLY wants you to pay for the test again. Fortunately, I bought NT4 Exam Cram by Coriolis Press and found it much more useful for exam preparation. This book is more like a supplement to a good learning book. Do not rely on this book to help you prepare for the exam. The Windows NT Server Resource Kit provides much more exam information."
1,Already Out-of-Date! Wrong testing method is used....,"I bought this book because it just hit the shelf, and I wanted a reference that reflected the current Microsoft testing methods. The NT Server exam this volume purports to prepare for is now tested exclusively using the Adaptive test method, yet this book and CD refer to the now-abandoned conventional testing method. I was extremely disappointed, and would not have purchased it had I suspected that Microsoft would not publish current materials."
4,Another Winner from Microsoft Press!!,"I don't know what it is these days, But MS is really publishing some good books. I highly recommend this book to determine your readiness for this exam. This book does not tell you how to perform the required tasks, it helps you pin-point your weaknesses and strengths.I gave this 4 stars because I ran into a few questions on the included CD-ROM that were incorrect and also because Self-Tests (The company that produced the questions, a.k.a. rejected beta test questions) commercial MSPREP software gives you the ability to print questions with the answers and explanations, But the software included with this book does not."
3,Mildly Helpful. Not Representative of Exam,"I used the book from this series for the Net Essentials exam and found the questions from that book far more representative both in terms of scope of material and level of difficulty.The questions from this book were not as difficult and some of the material it covered I thought irrelevent for exam purposes, and was surprised to see it covered, when it was not covered in any of the other books I went through: Server 4 for Dummies, Exam Cram, and a Microsoft Official Curriculum text(different than an approved study guide).I'd use this book a day or two before the exam just to help drill. You can burn through the entire thing in a couple hours.If you can get a good price on it, it's probably worth it. I just passed with an 874."
3,Slightly 'cheesy' but still useful.,"The actual sounds on the CDs must have been recorded some years ago. Their quality is not up to what one would expect from a modern production. However, their purpose is not to provide a listening experience per se but to illustrate examples in the book. In that sense, they serve their purpose well."
3,Blues & Jazz Complete,"Haven't really plumbed this book in depth. But bits and pieces are helpful (sections on major and minor sevenths, and voicings are very rich.)As I start applying/practicing some of the techniques, I think I will get a lot more out of it. The author knows his stuff."
4,Great flavor ... not thick,"This balsamic has a great flavor and is great to use on salads ans sandwiches, but is not reduced so will run right off that Caprese salad and sit on the plate more than wherever you poured it."
3,Expected more. I got what I paid for.,"I bought this aceto as the description stated that it was previously labeled as 15 yo aceto from Fattoria. It lacks the depth, syrupy quality and sweetness of an aceto of that age. Pay a little more and make sure you're getting the aging you're looking for."
1,Design Flaw!,"Handy because of the colors - morning and evening - but these containers have a really bad design flaw. Inside, the molded division between the two sections is not solid except at the very bottom. When you take out the lids to fill the container with pills, there is a deep U shape to the molded division between the blue and yellow side. So - my pills constantly slide across to the other side or jam in the middle when i am trying to fill the container. A crazy design. I had an older version of these and it was not like that. The division was solid to nearly the top. The pills stayed put. I would not recommend this container."
1,Get less than you pay for......,Product is junk! Wish I could give it a ZERO.......Arrived and several lids broken.Not worth returning.Threw them in the trashDON'T waste your money...................
3,Not thrilled,"This is great if you just want to leave it sitting on a desk, but it was not made to handle much more than that. I needed a way to carry all my vitamins but the lids kept popping open in my bag. What worried me even more was even when the lids stayed closed (thanks to some tape) any dust or dirt in my bag found its way into the compartments. I had vitamins at the bottom of my bag and lint in my pill box!"
3,Its OK,"Shipping is more than the box, this box cant travel itwill open in your bag. For the home its fine for 5 pills in a compartment, otherwise not to good.The plastic compartment covers will tear off within 2 years.Look its OK**** UPDATEOK Id now give this POS 1 star as I cant snap the compartments closed, what after 2 or 3 months. A piece of drek."
4,Holds them pills for ya!,"The pill box does what its supposed to do. The only thing is the nightime is backwards while the day time is forwards, but thats okay cause they hold them pills for ya. Not crazy about the colors either, and the only thing this box can't do is to remind you to take them pills. But they organize them well for you."
1,total garbage,"pros:very low price is not a pro if you have to return it or throw awaycons:uselessi guess 1-star rating is the minimum or I would give it a zeroi am 51 years old and my palms are ok but had a hard time to open compartments, i can only imagine 70 years old person with advanced arthritis trying to use itreason is it is made very cheaply, the type of plastic used and the mold design result in end product that shows at very first glance before using it that this could be a troubleand trouble it is, it jams making it impossible to useperfect example of a good concept very poorly executed, probably to meet the low cost objectiveyou get what you pay for, i.e. nothing !"
5,Excellent Purchase,"My 11 lb cat, Fritz, doesn't even notice the tag on his harness. I purchased the tag about two years ago and he has worn it every day since. I bought the small silver bow tie and it is light, durable, and there is plenty of room for all the information needed. Today I'm purchasing another one because we've moved across the country and need to update the address."
4,Good,"This was simply and nicely made. It arrived very quickly for a personalized object. With her other tags, they jingle, so I always know where the dog is!"
1,It broke!,"I put this on my dog about a month ago, and it is cracked! From the little hole to the edge, and the layers are falling apart. So weird! I need this to be reliable, I'm trusting my dogs welfare if he were to get lost! And it broke!"
4,Item is chewed easily,I loved the tag but I think is would be great if it came in a metal material. The tag gets scuffed after a short period of time. Other than that it made my pup look like a champ!
5,Very nice tag,"I got the black bow tie for my golden puppy. It is very cute. Not only that, but it is a very thick material and quite durable. It is reflective, which is a nice thing. You wouldn't know it to look at it, however, as it just looks like black laquer. But the entire piece is reflective.The printing looks just right. The vendor did a great job. I know this review is not about the vendor, but I think when it comes to things like something that is engraved it is elemental in the over-all satisfaction with the product."
3,Beware of How Easy Material is to Chew UP,"Great item, but even though I placed it well & just taunt enough under my 3 mo old pup's neck, he put chew marks on it and pretty much ruined in in less than two hours while I was gone. Beautiful when you get it, but don't buy until your dog is past chewing stage. I am sad to see it chewed up and my money wasted. I think the metal ones are the only way to go until you know they are done with teething."
3,Not That Bad - Not That Good,"I found this book somewhat useful as a study guide. It also gave me a sense for the layout of the exam and the general nature of the test questions. However, despite what some of the reviews say, many of the questions I encountered on the actual test were SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult/complex than the most difficult/complex questions in this book. This was especially true of the ""proposed solution meets required/optional results"" type of question. Another concern I had was the quality of some answers. I found several explanations in the first half of the book which were wrong. The answer given was correct (i.e. A, B, C, etc), but the explanation was completely ""off the wall."" For the purpose of review, I found the questions and answers in Exam Cram to be much better."
5,So beautiful!!!!!,"Hermoso, beautiful, so many details! great buy! My fontanini 5"" nativity look more real! every one says that is so beautiful!"
3,"Papineau, Consciousness, A Graphic Guide","Dear Amazonians,isn't this a bit unfair: To announce a book which ""will be released on December 21, 2010"" as something of a world first? I happened to buy this book recently on a similar announcement by Amazon.co.uk only to find out that it was simply a reprint of a book I'd bought a decade ago, the ""freshest"" references dating from 1997!Willi PloegerUniversity of Helsinki, Finland"
1,Bad experience with bad re-seller.,"One star is too many.I purchased this item with some concern based on previous reviews. One review in particular that worried me described how his Nano froze and had to be restarted only after letting the batteries die, after several days, because the recording unit software somehow had basically hi-jacked the Nano and would not shut down.I had the EXACT same experience, and had to wait 2 days to restart my Nano (my daughters). OK, fair enough, I was warned, and sometimes SHhhh...""STUFF"" happens, thats fine. Lets fix it and move on. BUT, then it gets frustrating. When I sent the item back to get my refund, they (the re-seller Electro Galaxy) are now charging me a restocking fee... for an item that sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt... SO.... if you want to avoid the excess charges, hassle of filing a complaint, and just get something that works, DO NOT buy this unit (or anything else from Electro Galaxy)."
4,XtremeMac IPN-MIC-20 Micromemo Digital Voice Recorder for iPod Nano 2G (Black),I had purchased this product and am very satisfied with the clear quality of the recordings! There are no fuzziness in the sound's background however a fault in this product is that the item can't record from sound sources that are 10 ft. or more away very well. The only way to fix this is to place this recorder right next to the source. Overall I think this product awesome based on the sound quality in the recordings. Another note: This item is VERY VERY affordable. I would highly recommend this item for those that need great quality recordings and need to save money.
4,not bad,"I intend to use the memo recorder as a way to bypass a $1000 professional wireless mic for video productions. I have to videotape 5 year olds. The micromemo does a preeeeetty good job. Even though I use the 16 bit 44.1k setting, there is still a little too much hiss. I have to process the audio clip to reduce the hiss, then it is useable. For college folk recording lectures or most anything else I think it does and awesome job. Pro audio though has higher standards. Someone on earth needs to make a $125 recorder that has NO hiss. This is a good product."
3,Lovely story,"It's a lovely story if the parent has time to explain. Initially it is sad, that the little boy can't walk. And my 3 year old had so many questions and a long face, till the end of the story. Once I read it once, and she realized it was a happy ending she was fine with it. She loved the christmas song in it."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I expected more. If I could have rated it, O star, I would have.I ordered it mostly for the collage portion. I have a 10 year old MGI photosuite program that I like better."
4,"Microsoft Windiows, XP inside and out","This is a very extensive volume of expert advice on how to use Windows XP and so far I have found it helpful, although a bit too technical that is not compatible with my XP."
5,Digital Image: Great for Dummies!,"Microsoft Digital Image is the latest version of the previous product: Picture It, which used for years. This new version is so similar, that I felt right at home and love it. I teach desktop publishing to real estate agents, and advocate this product for editing photos, as anyone can do it. I have Adobe and other software, but this is far better and much faster."
5,Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 Anniversary Edition [OLD VERSION],"A great product. Easy to use, and you can do alot with it. The seller was great and shipped soon. Faster than I expected."
2,What's the difference???,I cannot find a anything to differentiate with Digital Image Pro 10.Looks like the same program with new packaging.
2,Not worth it,I wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool. This program does not do well with fixing red eye. Software did not come with a manual. I am computer literate yet I found this software not easy to navigate. I found HP Essentials which is a free download from the HP website to be a better program.
4,M/S Digital Image Suite 2006 Anniv. Ed.,Product is terrific. Just what I was told it was. It is missing a few good tools though-such as not having the original image side by side with the image you are editing (so you can see the effect you are producing next to the original).
4,some bugs,I love the ease of use compared to programs like Photoshop. It's a basic program for people who have trouble with more sophisticated programs. It also is compatible with my old xp pro 2003 (? ) operating system.It does tend to crash often and I must keep trying different ways to get around what I want to do but overall I personally like it.
2,Smaller than it should be for the price,"Yes, it's 71"" long - but too much of it is straight up and too little is for your legs. The seat is also a little too straight up for comfortable floating. You end up with your back at an angle. I'm probably going to return it. Unfortunately, a full-size unsinkable floating lounge chair seems to cost almost $400. This looks like a good alternative from the specs - but it isn't."
4,Ultra-prolific songwriter/producer tries making own album with admirable results,"He's had a hand in the writing/production of dozens of hit singles, so one would reasonably have high expectations of his solo album. He doesn't blow things away, but it's still a fine album of well-crafted pop-rock that did feature the minor hit ""Love On A Rooftop."" Personally, I think the best song is the catchy, radio-ready ""The Price Of Loving You"" which, despite not being a hit, was played a couple of times on major stations."
4,Understandable,"I am currently taking and Inro to Economics class. I read this book when ever I get the chance. I never really want to read books that have to do with my classed, but this book i don't mind reading. It's taking me a little while to get through it but I can pretty much understand everything that I am reading. The only thing I don't like about this book is that many of the definitions are worded in complicated ways. But if you read the book it explains in a different way that you can understand. This book also uses real like situations in order for you to understabd it too."
5,Too good one for the price,These speakers are too good not only for the price but also for the output.I have been using these speakers for last 8 months.I am very much satisfied with quality of music it delivers.One important thing in it is it has bass control one can increase or decrease the bass according to ur wish.According to me it's like mini home theatre.If anyone want to buy then buy this one with no doubt.
2,2 months later the sub woofer doesn't work,"Well, initially I was happy with this setup. It was less expensive than a comparable Bose system I have for another computer. But, now after 2 months the subwoofer is not working anymore. I've double-checked the wiring but everything is still hooked up and no sound from the woofer. So, I can't recommend this system."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Stay away, stay far far away. This movie looked like it was filmed on a $50 budget in the alley between a motel 6 and a run down bar. The acting is horrible, the movie is gawd awful. I too fell prety to the few glowing reviews. I often wonder with such movies if the few good reviews are from those in the movie, or from friends of the director.Save your money. Save you time."
1,Oh Gawd,"Like an idiot, I read the three glowing reviews before renting this one but I wish I would have listened to my gut instead. Dubs disease, bad acting, bad costumes, and bad make-up all can be seen in the first two minutes. Stay away and if you don't and you've read this don't blame me. Beware of movies that don't have a trailer/preview.... There's a BIG reason for that. Personally, Amazon needs to get a hold of some of the craptastic ""movies"" that are being uploaded to their servers. At the VERY least you should be able to get a refund if you watch less than 5 minutes of a movie."
2,So good that I have forgotten most of the storyline after a week,"This is not a very well made movie and if I hadn't managed to pay such a small amount for its rental I might be a bit cranky about paying anything to see this film.There is nothing original nor outstanding about the film other than its un-originality and it's lack of being outstanding in any way.I would not recommend this movie for even a rental. Rent something else even if it is another repeat of the original Night of the Living Dead, anything else would beat this travesty.Avoid it like the plague is my personal recommendation."
5,One Of Nicholson's Best,"A rare compassionate character for Jack Nicholson , this was one of his best films , before Nicholson was relegated to playing weirdos and crazies . Tense with a believable plot and fine actors in supporting roles . As man in crises , an immigrations agent is forced into moving from California to Texas to be a boarder guard by his materialistic , air head wife . Once there , he is forced into a conspiracy of illegal activity with other border guards . He finally has to chose between the law and what is right ."
2,Slow paced weak story with a wandering plot,"This will be my briefest eval. The story lacks any likeable characters and the weak plot of transporting and killing ""Border"" jumpers lacks reality. Nickelson is to be the hero and central likeable character but he falls short. His wife is nuts and he can't or will not attempt to control her because of her ""romantic powers over him"". The poor disadvantaged widowed Mexican girl helps, then hates, fears and later thanks Nickelson ,but the tie between the two is weak.This slow paced and boring, story of dishonest baby stealing, border running, Mexican killing, Border guards in this story leaves nothing to enjoy."
3,Not a great movie,I thought this was a pretty good movie but not a great one. I didn't find it memorable or anything that really got my juices flowing. Of course anytime you have Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel on the screen together it is something worth watching. Go into it with the expectation of just watching two really good and cool actors doing their thing earlier in their career.Not a great movie but worth a look.
4,almost perfect,"The border is a great film,drama,action,and a feeling that jack is gonna snap and the fit will hit the shan before the end.the only problem is it ends way to quick,leaving a situation with his wife unresolved.but I guess a film that leaves you wanting more is a good thing?"
3,On the border,"Fairly average drama about the border patrol along the Rio Grande on the take while allowing illegal aliens across the border. One of them, Jack Nicholson, tries to do the right thing. Nicholson, who has been pressured by his prissy wife (Valerie Perrine) to get in on the takes, is finally disgusted by the whole thing and begins to help a young mother and her kids get into the US. It's all about corruption and the corruptible and the fine line between good and evil, but the movie has little depth as it probes these issues and is full of cliches. Not one of Nicholson's or Richardson's best efforts."
2,Not worth your time.,Bought this because we have a friend with a small part in it. He told us the movie wasn't great -- he wasn't lying.
4,The Border,As a former Border Patrol Agent and now Police Officer I found the movie to be quite in line with what was happening on our border during that time period and even today. The Border accuratly represents the law lessness that occured and is occuring along our borders. Great movie!Great job Jack!
3,Super Reader,"In the beginning, terrorism has hit New York. Lots of stuff and people get blown up.Big news and a hunt for those responsible ensues. It is not that simple, as The Black Master is at the heart of it. The Shadow ends up working with a foreign criminologists to try and solve the case.Habitually Hammered Harry falls victim to the Black Master's mental powers, which even The Shadow has trouble resisting.The Black Master manages to imprison The Shadow, after duping Detective Cardona to be at the wrong location, rather than assisting The Shadow, so that was new. Luckily he still has a trick up his sleeve.The Black Master reveals he was blowing stuff up to pin the blame on some old enemies (or people he didn't like), to get them executed.He is also nutty enough to try blowing himself up along with The Shadow."
4,Excellent,I have the 1980 hardback edition. It is without a doubt one of the best books on the subject of the bounty. The illustrations are great.
1,CHEAP!,I purchased these for a gift - they went back the same day I recieved them. I was appalled when I opened the box. Lamp shades are made out of glossy PAPER! You put a thin sprial thing over the bulb for the shade to sit on - but it's impossible to get it straight - so the lamp shade is always sitting crooked. They look cheap and are obvisouly very cheaply made. To top it all off- mine did not even spin! I do not recommend these at all - don't waste your money!
1,"Colors are faded, made in China","This divided server is made in China, not in England as the other pieces in this pattern. The brown floral design around the edge is light in color and it looks faded compared to other woodland pieces. It is ovenware. I have other ovenware pieces, that are not faded. The dog treat jar is also made in China and has lighter faded colors."
5,Hrabal's gem,"On sleepless nights, when seeking for peace of mind, sometimes I take Hrabal's ""Too loud a solitude"" and read a couple of pages from it. (Well, sometimes a couple of chapters.) Probably the reason it comforts me so much is that the language he uses is so beautiful. You probably have to have East-European origins in order to fully appreciate this kind of beauty, because the stories of Hrabal are all sad after all. But that's how life is in this corner of the world: a stange, grotesk mixture of humour, sadness, beauty and insanity. So it goes."
3,Has less impact now that Prague is no longer under Soviet rule,"I feel a bit churlish giving this novella three stars because it was written at a time when the topic of book destroying and cultural repression could not be mentioned out loud. The narrator has run a special press for 35 years, pulverising all kinds of paper, including books which the Communist government in Prague does not want the general population to read. The narrator saves some books for his own use, secretly sells periodicals to an elderly academic, and absorbs the knowledge from the pages that pass through his hands. Thus we see him quoting from all sorts of learned works through the pages of this slim work. Too Loud a Solitude is little more than a historical curiosity now, although it took courage to write at the time (the 1970s)."
3,excellent leads to do business,I found the book extremely useful and insightful into the myriad issues of working or doing business in usa.
1,"Where's the "".Net""","I found the title of this book to be very misleading. First and foremost, this book has nothing to do with the "".Net"" platform. At best this book reviews some Microsoft technologies that can be used when creating an e-commerce site (namely, Commerce Server), but misses the whole point of the "".Net"" platform (i.e. web services and the like). Additionally, I found the author to be very self-aggrandizing - ""I found that..."" or ""When I do do this I ..."" or ""I will define ..."". This becomes overbearing by chapter 2 - the entire first 300+ pages are about the esoteric nuance of web design - in his opinion. This book is weak in examples and techniques - it is not a "".Net Bible"" by any stretch of the immagination."
3,Hit and Miss,"I received the four cheeses and was somewhat dissapointed because although I enjoyed 3 of the cheeses, only 2 of those 3 were meant to be served as a cheese platter (vs for cooking on the 3rd). The fourth was horrendous and I ended up throwing it away (4 other guests of mine tasted it and agreed that it was not good - we could all tell that it was not spoiled and that it was simply not a good choice for an assortment). I also agree that the assortment should have come with more information about the cheeses themselves along the lines of: You have selected this assortment, cheese names, background, taste descriptions, and serving suggestions (food and wine pairings both). All in all, one of the four cheeses was good enough to add to a watch out list so that I can hope to find it again while shopping at a local store."
1,Horrible service,"The actual cheese is GREAT, if you can get them to ship to you. Ordered items as gifts - took over a week to ship. For timely gifts you would be better off going around the corner. Otherwise a great deal."
4,UNDER RATED MOVIE IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD,"Easily the most underrated of all of Romero's Dead trillogy, i like this movie.I admit the characters are cliched, and the acting for some characters is not oscar caliber, but its damn good!The most bloody and gore filled of all of Romeros films, and definatly the most intense.I know the budget was cut because Romero wnated to include the gore,but that is one of the reasons Romeros films are the way they are.Worth at least a rental.(4 stars out of 5)"
2,very disappointing - stick with the standard dvd,"after buying the original dawn of the dead on blu ray and halloween, which by the way is absolutely beautiful, i was excited to pick up day of the dead as well. what a mistake, the transfer is nowhere near the quality of dawn of the dead, which doesn't make much sense since day was made after dawn. i have the standard special edition of day of the dead and i put the blu ray next to it side by side and there was just a little more detail to the blu ray but again, nowhere near the detail of dawn or other blu ray movies. only worth it if you don't have the standard dvd."
5,best of the trilogy,"day was by far superior to dawn in lots of ways,stronger acting,better fx,the original script would have made this the ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" of zombie movies.but this is still a great movie,it takes a bunch of misfits (presumably the last people on the planet),and puts them in a hell of a situation,the army and the scientific team trying to resolve the problem of the dead over running the earth,on the military team is captain rhodes ,hell bent on destroying every zombie that walks(although he doesnt kill any in the entire movie),on the scientist side is sarah,a doctor looking for a cure for this disease,but she is rapidly running out of ideas,i wont give away the ending but its a classic although the last 2mins are very disapointing,i still give this movie 5/5 for sheer brilliance"
3,Good. But the least of the series.,"Well, the characters were unlikeable and there was no humor. But it was ok for horror."
4,Zombiemania!!!,"It's a gorefest, it's bloody, it's full of the F word, but if you're a Zombie movie fan like myself, you'll enjoy this horror classic. It could've been better, but it's a horror film, though the storyline sort of dragged a bit, but how can you say no to this or any George A. Romero zombiefest. It should be part of any Romero movie fan collection."
4,The Best from Romero,"In the 80's, one of my favorite things to do was turn out the lights and watch a horror movie. I guess I am still a kid at heart because it is still one of my favorite things to do. This was one of my favorite films from the 80's.Although Romero fans think this was his weakest film, I prefer it to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of The Dead"".Yes, the acting is cringe worthy and the plot is slow moving. However the zombies are excellent looking and there are lots of jumps and scares.You will actually root for ""Bubba"" the captured and trained zombie.The movie is slow moving but once the finale rolls around, it will all be worth it.The zombies find their way into the underground habitat of the survivors and wreck havoc on the humans. From the moment the zombies start descending on the platform to their victims below, it is full throttle. But it is very graphic from this point on, weak stomachs beware."
1,Repeat of Dawn of the Dead it is.,"I loved Dawn of the Dead, amusing, disgusting, funny, everything a good movie should be. I went to see Day of the Dead with high expectations and it was a let down. It's gory, but it's just like dawn of the dead only more boring, less interesting, and less funny. I highly reccommend Dawn of the Dead but stear clear of this one. The DVD extras are also very feeble on this one."
1,pretty bad,"As in awful. Poorly written, poorly acted, etc. And what about Bub? Give me a break. They also have a mad scientist type quack who goes by the name of Dr. Frankenstein. Ridiculous.Romero can do better--and has."
1,0 STARS: Maybe zombies aren't my thing.,"""Day of the Dead"", a horror movie??? Is that what you call it? I'm sorry, I just don't see it. ""Day of the Dead"" just did not come across to me as a horror movie at all. As a strictly science fiction movie, this isn't too terrible I guess, but as a horror movie, ""Day of the Dead"" sucks. And as I have said so often before, it takes more than gore to make a horror movie. I don't know, maybe zombies aren't my thing, but for the life of me, I just don't see the fascination in this movie from a horror movie fan's perspective. I apologize if I have offended anyone with this review, but I am just trying to give an objective evaluation of this movie's merits as a horror movie."
2,"only 2 stars, because....","OK, I have seen this movie a couple of times, and I can only give it 2 stars, because.....IT WILL MELT YOUR EARS WITH TONS OF UNNECESSARY CURSING! I mean BAD cussing! They went WAY overboard with the expletives, and ruined what could have been a very good Dawn of the Dead sequel! The first scary moment with the woman's dream where she's looking at a calender, and the Zombies hiding in the dark, this movie had such possibilities. Too bad they RUINED it with such foul language! Would a true die-hard horror movie fan forgive the cussing and buy it anyway? Not me, that's for sure! Although if you're not offended in the slightest by profanities you might, but I can't imagine any person being so callous."
2,Two stars only for the blood and gore!!!!!,"Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Creepshow is the very best of George Romero!!! the rest is ok, BUT this one is BAAAAAD!!!!BORING!!, STUPID story and complicated, BLAH,BLAH,BLAH!!, not too much violence, bad zombie make-up, very little action and suspense, so-so acting and a senseless ending.The blood and and gore was SOOO COOOL! but THAT'S IT!! sorry.Adios."
4,day of the dead,DAY OF THE DEAD is one of my favorite zombie movies out of the three.on BLU-RAY IT even looks better not a perfect picture but in HD really good better then dvd ill tell you that.for any zombie fan try them on blu ray.
3,"OK, it's not that bad after all","Alright, I hate to admit it, but after years of saying how disapointed I was in this film, calling it boring, stupid, a letdown and just flat out not good...it's actually grown on me. There, I said it.It's really not a bad flick. Still my least favorite of Romoero's zombie films, but worth checking out. Hell, must be worth owning in my eyes since I now own it (and am proud to have it in my collection). The movie has a bit more of a build up than Night and Dawn, I think that's why I never gave it much of a chance. If like myself, you watched this movie years ago and thought it was a waste of time, give it a second chance, the second time isn't quite as painful."
3,NOT ENOUGH ZOMBIES,"I liked Day of the dead exept there was to much talk about the zombies and not enough action. In my opinion this is the worst of the trilogy, but still pretty darn good. I dont reccomend buying this, but if you are a dvd freak like me I highly reccomend it.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."
2,"Garbage, actually","I do believe this is the worst of the zombie flicks. First, you have lousy makeup. The zombies don't look like reanimated corpes at all. They look like extra's in green makeup. Considering that the Night of the Living Dead was made ages ago and the zombies in it looked realistic there's no excuse for the cheesy look of this movie.Second, you have lousy acting. Most of the untalented cast spend the movie screaming at each other. The heroine is unattractive and bland. The villain is so over the top that he's irritating. The helicopter pilot's accent is the equivalent of a ""pull my finger"" joke.Bad acting, lame plot, poor special effects and a pace that moves at the speed of a elderly snail ruin what might have been an okay B movie."
3,George Romero Strikes again,"Fans of George Romero's work will appreciate the third in his Living Dead series. Unlike the first two films, which focus on a small group of individuals trying always to keep zombies at bay, this film focuses on a group of scientists and military personell attempting to discover more about these strange creatures in an effort to control them rather than destroy them. Day of the Dead features much more dialogue than the first two films and less of the enjoyable zombies, however, it still manages to provide viewers with a horde of zombies by the end of the film."
2,day of the dead dvd review,this was a terrible transfer to dvd of a decent little horror flick from george romero. the movie was rushed in transfer with much snow in the picture. keep your vhs copy until a better transfer is done.
5,URGGG!!,"Always Been A Fan Of Romeros..Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead,Survival Of The Dead, Diary Of The Dead..LOVE ALL THIS MOVIES!!"
2,Remarkably silly,"A remarkably silly movie. I'm struck by the awe for the ""great Romero"" in these posts. The movie is not scary, the zombies make you think ""MIchael Jackson,"" and the characters are such cheesy cliches that your really feel zombified after watching it. --oh, and there is just enough ""political commentary"" so that people who feel Cheech and Chong have deep political wisdom to offer (no offense to the great C and C intended), will ""ooh"" and ""ah"" at this movie. Perhaps that's why it gets so many favorable reviews. --I actually did watch the whole thing, stunned that so many positive reviews could be generated on what comes across as ""Euro political preaching.""I have no problem w/ being told that ""mindless consumerism is not very nice,"" but I like the artist to pay attention first of all to creating something that's, well, artistic (whatever the genre). This was not the case here."
2,This is a poor ending to the series....,"I could understand night, and dawn of the dead but this one I couldnt... The zombies move alot faster and there is more then the first and second. Which might sound like a good thing but its not.... About 78 minutes run into the last scene where the last two are running from them. The first and second dead film had an equal amont of zomibes in them now this tripe has 400 000. Rent this if you want to. The reason this got two stars was there are some cool gore and zombies but everything else is just lame.."
5,BRILLIANT,"I first saw Day of the Dead when i was 10 years old and i could not belive how gory it was, and how brilliant it was. Now seven years later i still think it is brilliant. This is by far the greatest zombie film ever made, better than Dawn of the Dead and Zombie 2(which are both excellent), i recomend that if you want to see a good zombie film buy this film now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,BOREFEST!!!,"This movie may have lots of gore, but I had already fallen asleep before it even got that far. Too much talk, and not enough scares makes this third installment of the dead series easily the worst of the lot. Stick with ""DAWN"" and ""NIGHT"", which truly do shock and keep your stomach churning."
3,NOT UP TO PAR FOR THE SERIES,"THE MOVIE IS FULL OF MEANINGLESS DIALOG AND BRUTUAL GORE WITHOUT MUCH STORYLINE.IT IS NOT FITTING TO BE CONSIDERED WITH THE OTHER 2 GREAT FILMS IN THE SERIES.A VERY DISAPPOINTING FILM FROM A TALENTED DIRECTOR.ALTHOUGH, IF YOU LIKE GORE THE FILM DELIVERS."
4,Romero does it again!,Another wonderful installment in the Romero legacy. I am so glad they put most of his stuff on Blu Ray (still waiting for night). The make up and special effects in this one go beyond the others and in Blu-ray you will be plenty grossed out. The guy on the table with no face is creepy! The feeding scenes are grusome. Enjoy with a friend or a plate of spaghetti!
3,A decent zombie flick,"""Day of the Dead"" this is the 3rd installment of the ""Dead"" series. Compared to the other films ""Day"" is probably the weakest, as far as zombie mayhem is concerned. However, the storyline is interesting and unique. Instead of the usual zombie carnal chaos we get to see the effects the outbreak has left on a few survivors and we actually learn the zombies remember. As far as zombie makeup, Tony Savani, has done a stellar job, especially the zombie that's missing the lower jaw. Again it's not the best, but it is underated and if you're in the mood for a zombie movie this will fill your appetite."
2,Bad print of a great movie.,"Sure the disc is jammed with extras, by the audio track is culled from multiple second hand sources (including a TV dub) and not the original release print. Give us the original audio PLEASE! Be warned, the dialogue changes are EASY to notice."
1,really painful plodding plot kinda irrational with good backdrop,"Watching this I realized I had seen it and the central science guy theme is so retarded that although the guy is good at the mad scientist and the background of a world gone zombie is cool, it ends up being painful as hell to watch. sneaky of them to change the cover!"
1,Oh man this is a bad movie!,"When I first saw this one back in '85 I was absolutely trembling with anticipation. Dawn of the Dead was one of my favorite movies and we had watched it on a Sony Betamax at least 20 times. Fangoria had hyped the heck out of Day and the gore looked incredible. Well, the gore is gorey, but the movie bites the big one. Awful characters, played by amateur actors, constantly arguing and yelling at each other, a villain so evil that he sneers every line of dialogue and scowls every time he's on camera (never seen him in a movie since, I wonder why?). The whole thing with Bud and the mad scientist was laughable-actually the whole thing is a waste. Romero should've waited till he had enough money to do it right. After the opening credits the entire movie is filmed in an underground bunker and yes the claustrophobia is contagious. I was out of my seat and into the sunshine before you could say-missed oppportunity!"
3,Much better than original Dawn of the Dead,"Romero came a long way since the original Dawn of the Dead. I just can't believe it took him so long to get it to this level. I wish it didn't have so much cursing and sexual inuendo, otherwise I would've shared with my kids"
3,A Curmudgeon review,"It's 1985 and the movie is Day of the Dead.The military in real life keep their hair short, and havegood manners. These don't, making the movie lessthan it could be. It wasn't a bad movie. In this moviethere is a story along with the gore, and the gore isvery effective, more-so than the story. The zombie, Bubis so like Frankenstein's monster that it is cliche in away. This movie was good enough. Enjoy!"
4,classic zombie movie,not the best but a hell of alot better than what romero has been doing lately like land of the dead or diary of the dead
4,One of the best zombies movies of all time!,"I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because the DVD case came broken and cracked like the mail man sat on it or something. The Discs were perfectly fine though so I'm happy anyways.This is one of my all time favorite zombie movies,a great addition to my collection."
3,"Good, but not great.","I enjoy this movie, but it does miss some of the magic of its predecessor, Dawn of the Dead. But, if you still consider yourself a ""Dead"" fan, you'll want to be sure you've at least seen it."
4,Day of the Dead(1985)****,"""Day of the Dead"" was quite the zombie movie , although I do admit that it wasn't the best in the series.Also this movie had some pretty cool special effects as well.Like all the other ones, this movie is about people who seek shelter somewhere, and take out flesh eating zombies whenever they feel threatened.In this one a team of people,(some including guys who where in the army)have seeked shelter inside some sort of missile silo underground.They are basically trying to wait out the plague.In addition, there is a scientist in this one who is trying to study these creatures hoping to figure the cause of the plague.Besides from that, towards the middle of the movie,the army guys seem to turn on the others, and act like they are in charge.As you might have guessed they are brutally rippd apart and eaten by the zombies at the end.The remaining survivors escape by helicopter to seek different place to hide."
4,"it's not Dawn of the Dead, but still worth watching","A lot of reviews I've read say that this isn't worthy of the series from which it's derives. This film is certainly not as scary/entertaining as Night and Dawn, but is still well worth watching.Okay, to be honest this movie is by all means not even close to as good as the first two. When compared to them,it looks worse than Divine's dog [stuff] in Pink Flamingos. But come on, if you're a fan of zombie movies give it a shot.It's a shame Romero didn't get a better budget for this film. Rumor has it, his original script was the ""Gone with the Wind"" of Zombie movies.Frankly my dear George, I don't give a [toot]."
3,"Na, Not really that good.","I seen this movie because of these great reviews written about it here at Amazon, but i was disapointed. It seems most of these reviews come from horror film lovers and Romero groupies. The music sounds like it should have been played in A Dance Hall rather than a horror movie, and believe this music plays through the entire movie! The characters babble on endlessly and really create no plot or interest in the story and through the first half of the movie you are just waiting for zombies to show up.The only reason i am not trashing this movie completely is the zombies were genuinely realistic and the flesh eating was spectacular to watch (but what else can you expect from Romero).Stereotypical 80's horror movie that avid fans will enjoy, but people like myself who just wanted see a good ol' flick, pass it up."
2,DAY OF THE DEAD,"The third film in George A Romeros Dead series doesn't hold up to its predecessors.Like earlier films in the series,Day of the dead portrays graphic scenes of cannibalism dismemberment, and other gory carnage.Unlike the other films,this one has no truly likable characters to root for.Not Rated contains scenes of gore and violence."
2,NOT VERRY GOOD,"Not verry good says alot. The acting was bad the story not that great, and he made the military a bunch of Jerk-offs. And what was with the profanity. I mean i'm all for it if it goes for the movie but it was pointless and seemend to have been put there just for shock value. The special effects are the only saving point otherwise I would have given it a one. Watch Dawn of the Dead To see how good Romero realy is."
5,"If you're a self proclaimed zombie fanatic, and you for some reason don't own this disc, pick it up today!","My favorite of Romero's ""Dead"" series, and my favorite zombie flick of all time. This is the movie I compare every zombie flick I watch to. The scene where Rhodes has his head torn off is one of the best scenes in any movie ever.The overall atmosphere of the film is disturbing, and its alot less light hearted than ""Dawn.""If you're a self proclaimed zombie fanatic, and you for some reason don't own this disc, pick it up today!9/10"
5,CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i will never forget the first time i saw this movie on VHS ,this was the movie that hooked me on horror movies forever it's the greatest zombie flick EVER!!"
5,Very Good,"I bought this along with Dawn of the Dead on Blu-Ray, and I must say that I am more impressed with the Dawn of the Dead transfer. However, this is a great addition to any Romero fan's collection. It is definately an improvement over the DVD versions, of course. So if you are a Romero fan, or have never seen Day of the Dead, I really reccomend this Blu-Ray version."
5,TRULY UNDERRATED,"I don't know why this movie is so underrated , i think it's scarier than Dawn and Night in my opinion , the acting is just as good as it was in both of those , the makeup is way better , it even won a saturn award for best makeup in 1985 , this has to be the second best zombie movie ever made in my opinion , sorry Roger Ebert this is a great movie , highly recommended."
3,No..no..no,"This movie is the least good of the ""Dead""-trilogy. Romero's previous movies were both very good (even though ""Night"" had a f*cked-up ending) but ""Day of the Dead"" ain't that good. Sure, it have its moments. But it's way too talky. The special-effects are very good, though. The zombies look scary as f*ck. But the actors are baaad, baaaad, baaaaaaaaaaaad!The scene were Steele's face get ripped off while he's lying down on the floor laughing could've been skipped.Then again, action-packed scenes like the one where the pilot steals Rhodes' revolvers and runs into the caverns to save Sarah and (the other guy) are very well-made.Overall, this movie is half-bad, half-good. Could've been better."
3,MEDIOCRE TO SAY THE LEAST,Yes i agree with others having seen this film i agree that it is the weak link in the masterful DEAD trilogy but hey those hollywood bastards didnt fund him enough to fully show us his magic and vision for this finale hopefully the hollywood hacks get off there buts and give him a ton of money to finish the series were the first one startedBREAKING GROUNDplease George save us from SCREAM AND I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMERYOUR OUR ONLY HOPE
4,Good conclusion!,This was a pretty good conclusion to a classic trilogy. The scenes of violation are even btter than the others however plot is a little bit thinner but altogether a terrific movie with great zombie effects and genuinly frightening. A must have for horror fans.
4,Day of the Dead,"If you want a good zombie film, this is it. This is one of many zombie films, I chose this film as a good representative of the era. This one hasn't suffered from censoring, though it could have done with some. I really saw someone's eye being torn out slowly. But I am obviously a little sick as I enjoyed it."
3,Romero's Third Zombie Film,"This zombie film is slow to get going, but eventually does deliver the gore it was hyped as. A small group of soldiers and scientists take refuge underground trying to control the zombies. But was it all a dream? For all the hype surrounding this film, I thought it was a pretty mediocre effort. Outside of several torso- rippings of the cast by zombies, and even that was just decent. In the commentary Romero said he originally planned a much grander film at a budget of $15 million or so; but they couldn't get that spectacle with an intended unrated cut. The film you see now was chomped down at a budget of $2- $3 million dollars, most of which I assume went to paying the cast and the special effects. This was also Tom Savini's masterpiece of his career. See it if you must; but IMO it doesn't live up to the hype despite some nasty zombie violence."
4,Zombies,"This movie although good gave me a rather grim out look on society, which i guess is the point of zombie movies :)"
2,Day of the Dead,"Ok, I don't like this movie a lot. In fact the only reason I watched it all the way through is to see the gore. The gore is disgusting and very well-done. Here are some reasons why I dislike this film; 1. It takes place mostly in the light 2. The profanity is stupid, there is no reason for 50+ f-words in this movie 3. It is way overrated. As always Anchor Bay has made a great DVD, jampacked with features. I only wish they wouldv'e done this kid of quality work to a movie like Airplane!"
2,not worth buying!,"I bought this DVD so I could see it in Blu Ray (sweet) definition. The high definition was nice (pleasantly, brutally graphic) but unfortunately the movie is pretty sad, dull, poorly acted, shabbily written and overall a waste of time. I actually am a B movie horror fanatic so am pretty forgiving of not-so-well-made horror movies, since they afford me such entertainment, even when not brilliantly done. But this one was too poorly made to even qualify for that! It was dull! And that just isn't fun! (and the soundtrack was dull too!)"
1,this is the worst movie ever made,why why why why why why why whyDawn of the dead was A **** of a lot better why do people actually like this movie zombies can not learn how to shoot gunsthis movie should be sat on fire and crap upon why o why would anyone like this movie i do not know if you are a movie fan do not waste your time unless your ready to laugh it is sooooo horrible i would rather drive off a mountain than watch this movie again i hope you can find this review helpful.
4,Crunch & Munch Finale!,"This movie is great if your a dedicated zombie movie fan because the special effects are excellent. Its set in Florida probably somewhere near the everglades, and in this chapter, the Zombies rule the earth with the last few humans battling it out for their lives not only against the walking dead, but against eachother. Only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dragged in some spots."
3,BANG! YOUR DEAD,"This movie was realy good, a little boring in some parts, but it explains alot about how the zombies thing and live. The zombie make up was done pretty good and F/X were realy good, the begining and end of the movie is alittle weird but the rest is smooth so youll pic. up the story fast. If you are a true zombie or horror person BUY this movie be for it goes out of print."
3,Great special effects,"Scientists and some obnoxious army brats take refuge from the living dead in an underground missile silo in George Romero's second sequel to 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"". Tepid story focuses more on character development than on zombie action, which is unfortunate because unlike the characters in the first two films, the ones here aren't very interesting. The last third of the movie picks up as the zombies start attacking in earnest, but until then it's a slow ride. Great gore effects from Tom Savini, if you're into that kind of thing - you know who you are."
2,This truly is a Dead series.,"I have to admit, I only saw this movie because I heard it was the goriest out of the 3. I wasn't expecting that to actually be true. This movie features some of the most disturbing death scenes ever put on film. Too bad the talking and theories became a serious bore after you realize nothing has happened for an hour. It is somewhat of an interesting movie compared to the other two, but it's not in the same class as Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. I guess they had to learn the hard way that releasing a horror movie the same year as it's parody (Return of the Living Dead)."
3,Romero cannot top Dawn and Night,"The first time I saw this I thought I was in for a great treat. Well, I was wrong. Romero is my favorite horror director, but this film just didn't do it for me. Now, of course the gore was spectacular, but the other 98% of the film was, well, boring. I hate to give Romero a bad review, but the constantly claustrophobic sets, the total over reacting between the characters, and not enough gore in general were factors that pulled down this potentially great film so-so. Still, I give it 3 stars because it is Romero, and the gore is splatter-tastic. Check it out, but be ready to be bored for 2 hours."
3,Something missing?,"Night of the dead - ExcellentDawn of the dead (Old and new) - ExcellentLand of the dead - ExcellentDay of the dead - Fair, why because the story line leaves a lot to be desired, couldn't even finish the movie but still is living in the Zombie collection."
3,Dead Daze,It was ok given the production date. The zombies were pretty good as well. Unnecessary racial epithets. They didn't add any value to the movie. If anything they detracted from it. Kind of silly kind of stupid as far as the dialog is concerned. I get irritated when characters make ridiculous decisions. I'm a huge zombie flick fan & if I had to do it again I'd still purchase it. Go ahead & take a chance. Bonus dvd included.
3,Boring with good effects,"Tom Savini is a master of what he does. The story is decent, the acting is horrible. The pace of the movie sucks, and the music sucks. I was expecting too much. It was a hard film to watch."
3,"Romero- and yet, not Romero","When the first scene opened, I was totally blown away. I thought: "" My God, this thing will be the best of the series!"" Well, by the end, I laughed at myself for thinking that. Now, the movie didn't suck, but it really didn't live up to DAWN at all. You get a bit of zombie action at the beginning, a little in the middle, and then all the rest towards the end. Wow. I expected this from Lucio Fulci (ZOMBIE), but from ROMERO?!? Rent this one first, folks. The zombies look great- pretty scary, too. But you don't see them enough. This may just be one you need to see twice- but it didn't quite have the luster of DAWN or NIGHT. Oh yeah- and the whole "" training a zombie to help humans "" was imaginative- in a Disney movie."
3,"George, We Still Love Ya But What Happened?","Growing up my favorite horror movie was ""Dawn of the Dead."" I loved that movie. It changed my life. Years later, I was sitting in my car and heard the commercial for Day and I thought, ""they made another one!!!!!!"" I never knew this one was coming so I called in sick to work and went to see this zombie epic. Well, I was SOOOOO disapointed. The first hour is nothing but talking, bitching, preaching, lecturing, but NO munching on humans. Now after reviewing the DVD, it seems a little better. The last part of the movie moves and is quite the zombie epic I wanted. I wish the beginning was better, but I'm happy with what I got. Now, George Lets make ""Land of the Dead"" flawless and remind Hollywood why you are KING of ALL zombie movies. Gore hounds out there you must purchase this disc! It's loaded with special features and is a limited edition."
5,good film/bad news,"Day of the dead is a better film than it gets credit for,so please check it out.I know this isnt the best place to say this but i have some horrible news about a sequel. DAY OF THE DEAD:CONTAGIUM.YES,a sequel/prequel to Day of the dead.It has already been filmed and is in post production.Just what we need when george romero cant get part 4 going,a crappy direct to dvd sequel out of nowhere.GO to home page of the dead if you dont believe me."
1,This book didn't help me with my art!,"I purchased this book because the title was rousing and stirred my interest. I'm a fem myself and I have been on the stage a couple of time in shows. ...Anyway, my point is that as a person of the stage I felt like I didn't walk away with any info that prepared me for my art or even my exams in skool.This was such a waste of my money and I really want someone to do something about this.Can we say refund? Hello?Sidebar: All of the hints at homosexuality on the stage was simply not needed. I think this editor needs to get a clue and get some facts STRAIGHT. Not everyone in theatre is like THEM!"
4,"Great Game, Bad Graphics","Okay let me start by saying I'm a big fan of simulation, sim, and business games so this is great for me. If you're not, the look else where. Now, another thing I want to mention is that I'm reviewing this game now (2010) when the game originally came out in 2000. (I think). So our standards from then to now has changed. The game itself is enjoyable, you run a business, control projects, hire and fire people, and design your company, have stocks and everything. I do admit, that after a few games in can become a little repetitious.Now the graphics are um...well they're graphics. They are 3D graphics but very poor. My Avatar HD game on my android phone has better graphics then this. But once again, considering that this game came out in early 2000 too.So that's my review, I had this game for some time, and came across it on Amazon, and just felt the need to write this review."
2,First-time filmmaker tries to tackle enormously complex subject,"This is the director's, Bryce Wagoner's, first film. In fact, this is his first time working on any film. Until now, he was working at a bar and voice-acting in several video games.After Porn Ends has the look and feel of something a first-time filmmaker would create. Wagoner picked a sexy, attention-gathering topic and then he treated the enormous complexities with something that looks straight out of a film school textbook that he skimmed. You are unlikely to get much out of it unless you want a Where-Are-They-Now of porn actresses.For a look at the porn industry that is surprising, insightful, and mature, check out David Foster Wallace's essay ""Big Red Son"" which appears in his bookConsider the Lobster and Other Essays."
3,Kind of Interesting,This video was kind of interesting but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone.The video introduced porn stars but they just didn't spend enough time with each on.Watching it was kind of a waste of time.
1,Save your money...,"This documentary is crap. If you're looking to gain some insight into the porn industry, its stars past and present, and what has happened to them, you'll find little in this film. This film is nothing but a hodgepodge of short, poorly edited video clips, with various porn stars. It was boring to watch and uninformative. I couldn't wait for it to end. Save your money."
2,Meh,I watch plenty of documentaries but this one didn't really grab me. The storytelling wasn't really there. It jumps back and forth between the former actors so much you never really get invested in any of them.
4,Balanced,"Surprisingly balanced, and avoided stereotyping and cliches. It could have gone deeper or broader, or provoked more emotion... but then again, I don't know how much these actors and actresses would have been willing to share to begin with. The videography and editing could use refining, and that part did have a novice vibe (even to someone who isn't big into videos like me)... but this was overall a really good, balanced, documentary that did a great job at humanizing the performers, despite whatever choices they ultimately made and whatever became of them after porn ended."
5,excellent,"This is an excellent documentary about the lives of people whohave been in the Adult Movie business. There are always thingsabout a film that could be done better and ""Life After Porn"" is noexception. I agree with another reviewer that some big names wereleft out and a better man/woman balance would have been good. But,the line has to be drawn somewhere and over all I think the makersof this documentary deserve lots of praise for making an interestingfilm which is neither too sympathetic or too critical."
3,"""Mile Marker 383"" Starbucks songs from the open road","This Starbucks cd - songs for the open road is a powerful and fun cd. It reminds me of the soundtrack from the movie ""North Country."" Lots of country, rock, blues, jazz combo music. When I listened to the cd, I can almost feel the wheels of the car spinning beneath me. The guitar music and husky guitar lyrics are perfect for a road trip. I like the cover of the cd - with a pink Cadillac driving down a lonely empty void-like American highway. I can almost taste the despair. The graphics are gripping and they have the ability to create a human abyss like experience. I particularly liked Telephone Road by Steve Earle, Bears by Lyle Lovett and Thanks Alot by Neko Case."
2,"This is ""Simplus"" NOT ""Simplicity""","This product is replacing the Mult-Action Simplicity solution, which I prefer, but has been discontinued by B & L.The new Simplus comes in 3.5 oz. bottles, in contrast to the 4 oz. bottles of the previous ""Simplicity"" solution, but costs more. B & L claims it does more than the ""old"" Multi-Action Simplicity. I find I need to use more of it each time I put in my RGPs. Why? Because most every time I need to remove one or both contacts and clean them again or else there is a noticeable haze to my vision.The now discontinued Multi-Action Simplicity solution worked the best for me, I am disappointed with Bosch & Lomb for their decision. When I contacted B & L, I was told this was a marketting decision, basically, tough s**t."
4,good,"Its auto-off functioning is not what I like, and it is slower than regular electric burner but it is still a good product. I like it, though! It is light and convenient to put anywhere you need it. Good product for its price!"
4,Works well,"Works well cooking eggs, making rice, etc. Used it while doing a kitchen renovation. Heats up pretty quickly and cools down fast as well."
3,Gets the job Done,"Pros- heats up quickly, robust, robust robustCons- alternates between on and off when it gets too hot. There doesn't seem to be a temperature adjuster to the thing, the nob only sets the shut off temp.Other thoughts- though I knew I was getting a grill design I wish it was solid, I use mine for distilling chemicals and so far destroyed the under plate, put dam it is reliable, big plus on that- part of it is melted, rusted, even been completely submerged in water, and its still works like it did when it first came in."
2,Annoying automatic trip,Burner shuts down every 2 min which is very annoying whenever u try to cook something
4,Simple,I make candles as a hobby and use this hotplate in that capacity. It heats up quickly and is easy to control the temp. with a little practice. It is easy to keep clean and the single knob control is very simple to use.
2,Came damaged,"Came damaged, still tried to use, heated up but on/off cycling is a pain. Seek higher end/better product"
3,solid,havent really used it a lot but seems solid - single electric burner - came on time heats things up - only thing i dont like you cant turn it off you have to un plug it that kind of sucks but know big deal
1,Don't buy,This Hot Plate keeps turning off every few mins which cause the cooking time to me much longer. There is no way for me to keep the hot plate running with out turning off every few mins. poor design.
3,"Defective, or strange?","I'm going to be using this in a halloween display and needed to know it's wattage to know if I'd be able to put two on a single circuit.It's a 1000w burner, but after a few minutes of testing with a Kill-a-Watt, it never got above 900w.Here's the oddity though, I bought two of these and slowly turning the knob, it goes from zero watts, to ~850 with no point in between. There is no difference in power draw between barely on and full blast.The second unit shows much the same range, but it starts about 750 watts.Side note: it gets hot VERY fast, I haven't left them plugged in long enough to see if I experience the ""cycling"" other reviewers have mentioned."
5,Steve's review,"The Proctor-Silex Fifth Burner helped and still helping us to survive our remodeling project. It is sturdy and well balanced. Heating control may not be the most refined, but I did not expect that for a product at this price. It is working well above our expectations."
2,Fast heating but not heat sustaining,"The Proctor-Silex Fifth Burner heats up quickly but after a few minutes, it shuts off by itself. I have to unplug to restart it. Wouldn't recommend using this item unless you have plenty of time and attention to devote solely to it. Otherwise, your food will be undercooked and soggy or greasy depending on your cooking method."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Yes, it is an electric burner. Yes, it heats up to the desired temperature. However, once it reaches the desired temperature the thermostat causes it to nearly shut off. All frying stops during the ""I Must Cool Down"" phase so any crispiness to the foods quickly turns to a mush.Yes, it is another NOT MADE IN THE USA product, this time offered by a wonderful USA company by the name of Proctor-Silex.Pure junk!Oh.. one unique feature of this electric burner is that the ""power on"" light stays on 24/7, so the unit must be unplugged when not in use.Horrible, just horrible."
3,Does the job,"I'm stuck in an apartment for this summer without a stove/oven, so I picked up this burner. I'm able to cook, but it takes about twice as long as it normal due to the burner cycling on an off. My water will boil, stop, repeat and my food will sizzle, stop, repeat. I can't complain too much since it's working out, but I just wish it would supply consistent heat to the food. The burner gets hot enough for most cooking and the burner size is better than most of the other ""portable"" burners that I have seen."
2,portable burner,a good little extra or portable burner. great for things that could smell up the house. However you must stay with it about constantly. thermostat has rather wild flucuations.
4,automatic shut off,"if i knew why this stove had to have automatic on and off cycles, i'd have given it 5 stars"
2,Limited use only!,"It's best for two things really - boiling water and quick sautes.It's not good for long cooking things such as stews, or frying sausages where you want to leave it awhile to develop good color or something.It gets super hot, temperature regulation is almost impossible, and stuff burns in the blink of an eye.It's workable, but definitely not my favorite burner I've had."
1,Junk,"this stove didnt work right out of the box, would have exchanged but I would have paid another $10 to ship back and forth. Waste of time and money"
4,works as advertised,works as advertised....use occasionally to brew coffee and prepare food outdoors....will have given it 5 star if power indicator LED was also a heat sensor....still satisfied customer and will recommend product.
2,So so,It works well minus the auto shutoff. It has a tendency to kit off every five minutes or so which greatly increases the amount of time needed to cook something.
1,horrible,I own three of these things and they are the biggest pieces of garbage I have ever seen. After you use them for a couple of weeks they start malfunctioning. The burn will just shut it self off you have to wait for about 5 -8 minutes then it will reheat ruining what ever you are trying to cook. I contacted the company and after weeks of sending information and answering all there questions all I got was the run around. This is a terrible product and the company is worse.
2,shuts itself off,"Like others, I've also seen that it shuts itself off from time to time. But I don't see how that can be any kind of safety feature. It is, however, very, very inconvenient.Plus, if anything spills over and burns on the chrome tray, you can't get the tray out to clean it."
1,short life,"I bought this product late Aug/early Sept 2009, and I used it maybe once a week to make food in my college dorm. It heated up fast and cooked food as it was supposed to. It is mid/late Nov 2009 now, and the hot plate stopped working. One day, instead of getting hot, it smoked up the room and set off the fire alarm (read: I live in NYC ...). After that, it just stopped working. I had expected it to last at least a year, but this is just unsatisfactory. Do NOT purchase this item."
1,Avoid this model!,"Received first unit and died within first week. Burner was on a dedicated outlet; yet it started tripping circuit after using for a week. Sent back for a replacement. The replacement simply stopped working - also within 1 week; it would get warm, but not reach medium to high temperatures. Going to return and try a different manufacturer."
1,Keeps making my power go out,"I bought 2 of these hoping I will be able to use it in my kitchen. Everytime I plug it in and turn it on, it makes the power in my kitchen go out. I can't even use these at all at home."
1,One burner burned out after 1 use,I know there cheap but burned should work after one use!!!!!!!!!!!!!Would not reccomend anyone purchase this item m m m
1,I didn't believe the other reviewers!!!!! Dumb move.,"Other reviewers complained that this thing wouldn't even boil water in a reasonable time but, no, I had to order one! I am using it in the bottom of my smoker along with an electronic temperature controller. I have a Kill-a-Watt electric meter hooked up to monitor amperage as I test the electronic setup. It showed that the darn heating element kept shutting off even though I have it turned all the way up. I never could get over 155 degrees in the smoker after 6 hours! Tomorrow I am tearing the darn thing apart and fixing it. What a piece of junk!"
4,Decent Burner,"Pros: Burner works very well and does exactly what I purchased it to do, which was actually to light hookah coals on so that I don't have to ruin my current stove in the kitchen.Cons: I always use the burner on the highest setting that it has and after a while the coils turn off for a minute which I don't like. however it does work and they always turn back on without me having to do anything.Overall: Love the burner, it works great, its portable, and it does exactly what I purchased it to do."
3,Proctor Silex burner,It is still working after a year so it is pretty good. My only complaint is that when it is powered the light is always on no matter where the setting is on the front. This could have easily been solved by making the the dial on the front have a switch as part of it so that when you turned it all the way down it would turn off the light.
2,Doesn't seem to heat above 200 deg,"I've had this hot plate for about 2 years now. It's barely satisfactory. It has a long cycle time, which means cooking temps vary significantly, and I frequently burn what I'm cooking because when it's in the ""on"" part of its cycle, it's @ max heat (glowing heating element). Very difficult to get things to actually cook @ low or medium with this.Also, I wanted to make toffee this year for Christmas, and before I started, I went to test my candy thermometer with the ""boiling water"" test. I discovered that this hot plate will literally not heat 4 - 6 quarts of water above 200 degrees. It just maxes out @ 200. Maybe it's a safety feature? Seems kind of weak, though, given that 200 degrees is not even boiling. :(I just ordered myself a new Broil King. Based on the reviews, it sounds like it's a much better option."
4,Good Item to Own,"I like this item, however, the one issue that I have with it is that you cannot turn it off. When it is plugged in, it is on. Turning the switch to off does nothing more than put it on low.This is a great item to take to hotels, or wherever. I bought it for teaching cooking classes. I have not used it at one of my classes yet, but have tested it out at home.It heats up quickly and cooks evenly. I highly recommend this unit."
2,okay for boiling water,"Yes it heats up, but it keeps cycling on and off, no matter where you set the temp gauge. And sometimes it takes quite a few minutes to come back on again. Okay for boiling water, but frustrating for any skillet cooking! Maybe I'll try the Iwatani countertop butane burner..."
2,Very inconsistent heating,"Burner seems to go back and forth between super hot and warm, no matter where the thermostat is turned...Would not buy again."
2,"Product description should outline the ""safety cycling"".","As others have reviewed this thing has an annoying feature that is not advertised that essentially turns the whole burner off when it hits a certain temperature. Annoying to say the least, this product is only food for heating up water for oatmeal and maybe a small pot of pasta or soup. Forget preparing an actual meal where the plate needs to be on for an extended period of time. I would not buy again."
4,Love my Proctor-Silex 34101 Fifth Burner,"Very affordable, works very well. Cord could be a little longer, but when I need an extra burner, here it is!"
3,Quick fix but won't last,"I've used this hot plate very regularly. As other reviews have mentioned, it sucks that even the ""high"" setting will turn off and on as a mode of temperature control. It will cook your food, but don't expect to be able to get the nice sear or stir-fry heat that you want. After awhile, part of the coil actually stopped heating (turning red) but really, how can I complain for this price? It still heats my pan enough to ""cook."" Don't expect power or constant temperature. It just sterilizes food :)"
2,Depends on what you're using it for,"I purchased this ""hot plate"" to use for roasting coffee beans outside.The problem I encountered with this model was that it would only heat for a few minutes and then would shut off to cool before heating up again.Coffee beans take approximately 6 minutes (give or take depending on the type of bean) to roast. Just when the coffee beans were entering the last stages of roasting, the unit would turn off. Not good.For the low price I will keep the unit around for other potential uses should a need arise, but as for the intended purpose that I bought the item (roasting coffee beans) it is more or less useless."
5,Fifth Burner,This was agreat deal for an item exactly I needed. It's working great and hope to use it for a long time. The delivery was so fast I could not believe it! Thank you very much.MIR
4,"the product is fine, it just does not work for what i wanted to use it for.","the product is fine, it just does not work for what i wanted to use it for."
1,Fifth Burner,The Fifth Burner I bought has not lived up to its advertisements. If I am looking for another to replace the one purchased I will go to a store where I can see the product before I pay for it.
1,You get what you pay for...,"I wanted a cheap hotplate, and that is exactly what I got. I haven't noticed that it cycles on and off like the other reviews say, but it definitely does not heat evenly (or maybe that is just a result of my cheap pots), nor does it get a pot of water to an actual rolling boil. It is lightweight and poor quality, but it works, so if all you're looking for is a temporary- or occasional-use hotplate, why spend more? One good thing is that the heating element lifts up a little bit so that you can easily clean under it or put a spill-tray in. And it does have a nice, sturdy cord."
1,Not funny and with no eroticism whatsoever!,"OK, so they were trying to parody a women-in-prison film. I get it.But why couldn't they have at least made it a little bit erotic? I mean, they had all of the necessary ingredients for a potentially very campy & fun WIP film, but the director wasn't interested. Instead he included GUYS! (Notice: There are NO GUYS on the DVD boxcover!)There wasn't a single erotic girl/girl encounter in this entire video! And it's supposedly about women behind bars! The humor is aimed at third-graders, and the female nudity is barely noticeable. Pass on this one."
2,"The Ending is so Convulted and Confusing, it's Ridiculous","Save your money on this one. Very uninteresting and the ending is so crazy, you'll be annoyed that you bothered to finish it. Still don't even know who's alive and who's dead, nor do I care."
5,French Raclette,"Exceptionally Satisfied with this French Raclette. Superb aroma, flavor and texture. A complete delight to the senses. The whole family enjoyed this cheese."
5,Perfect for Raclette grill,This cheese is delicious and perfect for use on your raclette grill. It melts easily and has outstanding flavor.
3,"Nice style, but not ideal","These are nice coasters -- simple, stainless steel, and they come with a nice holder, too. From a viewing perspective there is nothing to complain about, but from a usability perspective, they are a bit lacking.The problem is that the circular area where you place a drink is flat steel, which results in a vacuum when the drink/glass is set on it and sweats a little. If you have a hot drink, or room temperature drink, this wouldn't be a problem, but with a cold drink, the condensation that rolls down causes the coaster to stick to the bottom every time. A few ridges or series of bumps/lines would prevent this.I will say that they do fine in the dishwasher, despite being labeled as hand-wash only. They also have a decent wide lip that helps support the coaster and drink on soft surfaces like carpet, cushion, etc. Not perfect, but not bad.Overall, I probably wouldn't buy these again, but they weren't a poor buy, either."
4,Love their lyrics,"Love this album.! Their lyrics are amazing and their sound is really unique. I have it in my car and there's something for every mood. Favorites are Red Light (hot but heart breaking too), Follow you, Waiting for the War, Ignored, Universe. I've seen them live and they were worth the trip out. Their singer/song writer isn't bad to look at either.>;-)"
3,Too general...,"This is a book about science - black holes, string theory, alien life. It could have been given any title - Science in Firefly, Science in Star Wars, Science in Star Trek - and the chapters would have been the same, with only a few paragraphs changed. Not saying it isn't a good book on science but it is only using the Guide to hook people into buying it. Get it used or from a library."
5,Swing Rules.,"I bought this CD to complete my collection of Lisa Stansfield's work. I've been in love with her voice since her debut release Affection. But like most of her fans in the US, I knew nothing about the movie Swing. After seeing the video for Baby I Need Your Loving on a public access music show, I decided to give it a try. I have never been more shocked by a cd purchase. This has become my favorite of all of Lisa's music because it's so different from what she's done before, yet the music is so perfect for her voice. From Baby I Need Your Loving to the killler Why Do We Call It Love this CD..well...Swings. The true gem of this release is Two Years Too Blue, if ever there was a voice for singing a torch song, Lisa owns it. Put this disc in and let the music take you. I guarantee you won't be disapointed."
4,It's a great soundtrack,"Most Americans probably don't realize that this is a film soundtrack to a British movie by the same name. Knowing that means the album makes a lot more sense. I had never even heard of Lisa Stansfield until I saw this movie (which also stars the hunky guy from The Full Monty). It's a very cute movie, and a very cute and swingin' soundtrack."
2,Not as thrilling as I thought,"I hate when DJ's play a weak song and you're standing on the dance floor trying to signal him to move on to the next track or do something dramatic. This happened one two many times on this CD. I actually considered returning it before I opened it because Dope Gonzales has a hip-hop flavor rather than an actual house flavor and I thought it was sent in error. I held it for 2 wks until I consulted a NY DJ about it. Whatever he and LLV do as MAW is magic, but there is something less desired here. But I will say that he did start jamming towards the last five jams of the first CD. But at a club, I would be demanding my $$$ back. Anyone wanna buy a copy of this? I have one for sale"
5,warning: genius at work,"archives 3.5 / 4 possibly features Vai's most extreme, pyrotechnical play...what with ultra-speed picking, tapestries of tapping scalar work, floyd rose abuse and soulful vocals thrown in the mix too. Not to be missed"
5,Archives Vol 4 Was Awesome,This has some of the best music I have heard. It is not your typical commercialized stuff. It is soulful and outstanding music.
5,Romance for American homes,I had to write my own review because I just read a review from someone who said that the book was about European interiors (or something like that). The book is clearly photographed in American homes and is full of romantic ideas that I can use here in the northeast. I can easily translate the ideas in the book using new furniture and decorative accessories from local stores and from some of my favorite catalogs (like Ballard Designs and Rue de France).
4,Nice book,I really enjoy browsing through the pages of this book. I found that it had some waisted pages that would be better with decorating ideas instead of a few lines of writing.
4,Very pretty,"Not my taste (I'm a young Gen Xer), but my mother will love this. Perfect for Mother's Day."
5,Great Books!,"Best books on the planet if you are going camping! I spent 2 1/2 months on the road through 48 states and I would have never been able to do it without them (this one and his eastern edition). A must have for the low-budget traveler who wants a surefire way to find a campsite when you need one. Excellent directions and although some of the descriptions are a bit misleading, it is very easy to see where they came from. Warning: Some of the campsites are no longer usable! We found a couple that have been flooded or overrun with cows (yes, cows)."
4,Where west is east,"Readers selecting the Western Edition should know that Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana are actually included in the Eastern Edition and not included in the West. I suspect this was done to make the size of the two volumes roughly equal, but the tag on the cover is misleading.Otherwise both east and west are excellent. For those looking to camp off the beaten path while, at the same time, saving a few dollars these guides are great. The numbered map locations are great for the traveler when it comes to answering the question: ""Where can we camp close by?""We've used these books for years and, were it not for the placement of some west-of-the Mississippi- states in the Eastern Edition, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,The author must have flunked Geography class... Guide leaves out 5 states!,"Apparently, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana are not west of the Missisippi, according to Don Wright. This book is completely useless for the trip I just ordered it for. I'm somewhat ticked off about this, as I see from a quick perusal that it's just what I want. Now, of course, I read another review that mentions this. Let this be a lesson - read reviews thoroughly!"
1,I cannot get this to work,"I received the Bialetti Mia pot today and I cannot get it to work. The instructions are very basic. I don't know how hot to turn on the stove, how much coffe to use. I have tried four different times at different temperatures and coffee never goes into the top of the pot. When I take the pot apart there is coffee at the bottom of the pot in the tank but I thought this was supposed to steam into the top to pour. Plus the coffee in the bottom of the tank looks nasty!"
5,a must for halloween,"Seen the Voodoo organist and the Devil Drums live in SF. Fun as hell.This is my favorite. Check out Battery Acid. I play this entire CD every Halloween in my garage/haunted house. Black lights, fog machine and this cranked up real loud.Scares the crap out of some kids. They won't even get near the house!! This is Dance music also. Creepy dance music... Screamin' Jay Hawkins style.Twisted.........."
2,Ignores the last 35 years of archaeological study,The author unquestionably accepts the Biblical Exodus or Conquest theory about the development of ancient Isreal that has been rejected by almost every scholar since the 1920's. He then adds his own speculation on top of this mythical foundation. The result is a string of rather silly assumptions that add absolutely nothing to the study of this comlex subject. In fairness it would make a great script for a movie if only Steve Reeves were around to appear in it.
5,"Tuesday Morning, 9/11/01","I've been working in lower Manhattan for 20 years, 12 of them in the towers. I've seen this city through the highs and lows. A year ago history tapped us on the shoulder and we responded. The face of hatred tried to change our way of thinking and challenged our way of life. We responded. As Americans, we stepped up and rescued people in danger, we donated blood, and we gave our time and compassion. Some paid the ultimate price and we applaud their bravery and mourn their loss. Together we pray for their families to carry on their spirit. A spirit only found in this great city and this great country. The vivid re-telling of these stories from brave people are tastefully scribed here. If you were here that day, this will bring you back to Tuesday morning. If you watched helplessly on television, this will put you in our dusty shoes."
5,Excellent Chilling Account of the Events of September 11th,"This was a very powerful, moving and often bone-chilling account of the events of September 11th- a day that we will all remember forever. It depicts real-life people and their experiences on that aweful day: firefighters, police officers, EMS workers, and people who worked in the World Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon. I think I was most affected by the stories of the employees of the World Trade Center & Pentagon who were literally only a few yards away from where the planes crashed and still were able to make it out alive. There are alot of details in this book that we never heard about on the news--things that were kept from the public to shield us from how horrible this event really was. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the events of September 11th by reading the chilling tales of the people who were there and survived this terrible tragedy."
4,"Well done, but there is just this feeling ....","I must have bought ten books that deal with 9/11. A lot of them are eyewitness accounts. It seems as though the same folks are willing to give the same interview over and over again, with some minor changes. Some of the content in this work is original, but for the most part it's the same song over and over again. I feel for what these people went through, I just wonder when authors simply take advantage of secondary sources and write another book. The premise of the book is good, the intent is decent, the end result isn't as compelling as it should be -- unless you read this book first and then read other books on 9/11. Then you'll write the same review of the other books you read after this one. It is just that the same people tend to re-appear over and over. I gave the book 4 stars, not out of charity, but because the authors did a good job. However, the stories were very much the same."
3,In all fairness I didn't read this book.,"I came here to this site where you are now and was going to purchase this book. I thought it was a good idea to take in some of the things that happened behind the scenes, and hear many of the accounts of personal experiences. My heart wouldn't let me. I have a hard enough time just thinking of what happened. I still think of it everyday, first thing in the morning and through the day. I will never forget that day. I just can't read this book yet. A year has passed this is Sept 6, 2002. I will watch all the tributes and shed tears again. I am sure this is a very powerful book.My heart still bleeds and will never forget."
4,"A difficult read, but an important one","I could only read a few chapters a day, because the content was very depressing and difficult to read. However, it is something that Americans should read to know the true suffering and heroism that happened on that day. I did not know anyone in NYC personally, but I feel now after 5 years that I really understand the magnitude of this event."
5,Usable and Research Based Book!,"Book Club: A Literature-Based Curriculum meets the needs of all teachers. It has practical handouts, tips, and management tools for implementing book clubs in the classroom. Moreover, the book includes indepth explanations of the reading process and the research behind the effectiveness of book clubs. A must have for elementary and middle school teachers."
3,Wish the letter and word pronunciation were clearer,"We bought this product after loving the Math Mat for addition and subtraction. We purchased this to help with spelling and phonics and teaching letters to younger kids. (We love Math Mat!) However, this product doesn't clearly pronounce the words so even an adult has problems understanding the word or letter being asked for. There is not a repeat button like there is on the Math Mat, you can just intentionally hit a wrong letter or make a best guess and it will give you another try. It is frustrating to try to give the correct answer and find out you misheard the question. Also, because it is so big it is easy to step on an adjacent letter. Maybe it would be better if it was designed as a circle. It is a big step for little legs to the center letters. It has not turned out to be the helpful tool we were hoping for. The kids still like it a little but frustration enters in quickly. It is nice that you can play music on it."
1,not much fun,My children have had this toy for several years. My 3 year old pulls it out once in a while but neither really enjoy the toy. It just doesn't work very well. It's a nice concept but they can't get it to do what they want and when they do it is a bit slow to react. It does hold up well that's for sure. But for the room it takes up it's kind of a pain that the thing won't just fall apart already! All in all it's a good idea just doesn't work well enough to make it fun for the kids.
5,everything you want to know!,"Before I had to move into the city, I raised Muscovy ducks as a hobby. This book is indispensible and very well written. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to raise waterfowl for fun or profit. I'll definitely be pulling it off the bookshelf again when I'm in a place where I can resume raising them!"
5,The Best Livestock Book I've Ever Read!,"This book tells you everything you need to know about raising ducks. I've had a small flock of ducks for six years now, and this book has been very useful.Unlike most of the other livestock books I've read, it is well written, and holds your interest. I sometimes actually reread this book for fun, even when I'm not looking for any specific information."
1,Where is it?,"OK folks, where is the kindle edition? And where is the kindle edition of The Morgaine Saga?????? These books are incredibly well written imho"
5,Exil's Gate,"The novel Exil's Gate by C.J. Cherryh is about an epic journey of Morgine, who is on her way to close the gate of Morond. Many fierce battles take place while she finds and fights her way there. But on her way she meets other characters like Ichandren, Chie ep Kantary, and vayne. Their characters help Morgine to suceed in closing the gate. I rated this novel 5 stars due to its action adventure theme and that its a book that you cant put down. But I would really reccomend this to anyone who wants an adventure."
3,"the same, only more","If you liked the first parts, that is fine, but she is milking this plot line a bit too much. Still, she is one of the best."
3,does this product expire?,"Bought this to restore a vintage razor blade. It left it looking brand new with a mirror polish. Such a small amount of polish is needed I'm sure this'll last me years. After using it on the razor, I've used it on skateboard trucks, knives, and brass decorations. It has worked great on all applications.Update: Once I was done using this polish, I stored it. About two months later I needed it again. I opened the container to find the cream had layer of yellow fluid on the surface and smelled strongly of ammonia. I tried mixing the liquid back into the cream but it did not mix. The cream now has the consistency of low viscosity goo and can't polish anymore. I emailed Blue Magic to get some answers but I never received a reply.Three stars because before it turned to goo, it worked flawlessly. More like 2.5 stars since I was only able to use about half."
2,Did not work on my aluminum or silver,I used it on my aluminum and silver ware and this product had a strong smell and did not work well with either.
5,Great for motorcycle chrome,This worked great on our motorcycle chrome and we found it here cheaper than in the store. Quick ship too.
4,Beware!! READ!,"First, HEED the warning of inhaling fumes. It WILL burn your throat and nasal passages if inhaled too much! So, be careful. I inhaled too much of the fumes, and I had pharyngitis as a result. Couldn't speak for two days..that's how bad it can be, and I was lucky I didn't burn my lungs. It's extraordinarily dangerous when you don't wear protection. It can also cause eye irritation. I'd say that you should probably wear protective goggles, gloves, and a respirator mask, especially for big jobs. I had a big job and therefore I was exposed to the fumes for too long without protection. I'm not exaggerating, it's harsh!Secondly, this didn't work well on old stainless..but it worked great on old brass."
5,"Great product, saved my silver!!",Really great I thought I ruined my silver with tarn-x but this made it look brand new!! Awesome stuff! Polished all of my moms old silver that she thought was beyond help and it made it look beautiful! Is worth every penny!
5,amazing,Does this stuff come in a bucket? I have tried several things to clean and polish the aluminum wheels on my 4wd. Years of oxidation and ground in crap from the trails left me thinking I would never get them looking good again. I was wrong. This polish works wonders. It really is magic.
2,Very rapid pace,"My 3-year old young son loves monkeys, so I thought this would be good. We've only watched it one time. The problem is that it is too fast paced. Rather than showing video of monkeys in their habitat and observing their behavior, it switches from shot to shot too fast, while trying to be funny. You never see monkeys behaving like monkeys. It almost makes me dizzy watching it. It might be better for older kids."
2,Works but with flaws,This cable is nicely designed but it has problems with the sound. Sometimes I have to adjust my headphones connection to the extension cable to get the sound come out normally. Belkin extension cable that I bought in Target works much better.
1,An Even More Brilliant Imposter? Is that even possible?,"Just considering that Paul McCartney wrote some of the most brilliant songs of his career AFTER the supposed date of his death ought to put an end to this nonsense once and for all. Think about it...""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", an album that was largely Paul's idea, began recording AFTER his alledged death and replacement. I'm mean REALLY what are the chances that they could not only find someone that looks just like the original Paul McCartney (in an astonishingly short amount of time) but is also an even MORE brilliant songwriter? The odds would have to be absolutely astronomical!This DVD is surely just more cash-grubbing junk, shamelessly digging for gold in the Beatles' legacy."
1,This is ridiculous,"This is without a doubt the most horrible ""PAUL IS DEAD"" DVD I have ever seen. Absolutely the worse. Can't believe I spent money on this. Tomorrow it will be my dog's new frisbee."
1,AVOID!,"I thought this DVD might be interesting or, at least, fun to watch.It is neither.You will be angry if you buy it.The voice of George Harrison is so poorly done it's embarrassing.ABSOLUTE JUNK!One star because I couldn't give it a minus rating."
1,Shear Drivel,"I watched this on Netflix and it is so bad it is funny. First off it is supposed to be a tape that was left behind by George Harrison confessing that they had pulled off the biggest con of all time by replacing Paul with some one who they supposedly jokingly referred to as Faul. The voice on the tape is in no way shape or form George and every once in a while the idiot looses his accent and changes his pronounciation of words. The story is so crazy I found myself laughing at what I thought was supposed to be a serious documentary that turned out to be a mockumentary. I kept waiting for the Rutles to show up. For the love of god and all that is holly do not buy this garbage it is badly done and that is putting it nicely. It amounts to slander and George's estate should sue them for using his good name in this garbage in fact all the Beatle should sue, yes it is that bad."
1,Hilarious,"There are so many ""clues"" out there that may or may not have been deliberately placed, and it's been fun to try to decipher them through the years. However, this film had me laughing out loud with each new ""revelation"" that the voice of George relates. I have no doubt it's someone named George speaking, but his last name was certainly not Harrison. I fun thing to see, unless you really don't know the Beatles' story. Then it sadly might become believable. Don't pay more than a few jelly-babies to see this."
1,huh?,"this is the dumbest thing i have ever read,i would'nt even waste the time to watch whatever garbage this is....unbeleivable!!!!!!"
2,Could have been better,"It was obviously meant as a comedy and was somewhat amusing. Could have been a lot better with some fact-checking, as mentioned in other reviews. Skip it if you can, don't expect much if you can't."
1,Horrible,3 forensic experts who could not verify that it was Harrison's voice? Come on. That was one of the worst voice imitations I've ever heard and is certainly not George Harrison's voice. I stopped watching after 10 minutes. Just awful and not even a good satire if that is the intention.
1,Transparently Fraudulent,"I'm a sucker for all things Beatles, and of course, familiar with the ""Paul is Dead"" mythology. This is an attempt to turn that into an entire conspiracy theory explaining why John was killed and why George was attacked in his home. So chock full of factual errors in the first five minutes (for example, George mis-remembers his age difference from Paul) that the implausible ""George Harrison"" narration (a moderately good impression except that he employs an articulate vocabulary dear George never commanded in life, and then the accent itself starts melting away) was out-shadowed by the cheesiness of it all.Everyone associated with this piece of tripe deserves to be slapped. But if you enjoy supermarket tabloids, or the voices in your head have begun to bore you, maybe it'll be entertaining whilst you bite your toenails."
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.","I streamed this off of Netflix and was so glad I did not pay any money for this. Absolutely horrible. Two hours of my life that I will never get back. I can't even say this was campy, conspiracy theory fun; it was bad all around - production values, acting, voice-overs... everything was slapped together so poorly. Whoever funded production of this dvd should be ashamed... as well as dragged into the street and shot. The fact that Netflix streams this pile of poo while you have to request the dvd of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" just baffles me. Save your time and money. There are so many better unauthorized Beatles dvd's out there. Don't be lured in by the ""Paul is dead"" intrigue. You will be sorely disappointed."
3,Interesting...,My honest opinion is that some people have way to much time on their hands. They spent a lot of time researching and piecing things together. I am just not sold...
1,unadulterated crap,"Don't waste your time or money on this. It's lacking in every respect. Like most conspiracy fantasies, this has nothing to stand on."
1,Disgusting.,"I didn't buy this crap; oh, Horrors, NO! I saw this trash on a Roku channel, and it is just that; Trash! The Producer oughta' be sued."
2,"Funny, whether it means to be or not","If I were a Paul is Dead purporter this movie would make me extremely angry. Whether it means to or not, it's hilarious! The theories they present are ill-informed, goofy, and over-the-top. And the final testament of George Harrisson? Beyond this movie you can't find any information about it anywhere. It's also a pretty crisp recording considering they claim it was from a tiny casette tape. That, and it's the worst liverpool accent I've ever heard.It's ridiculous but if you're willing to entertain yourself with what people will believe or will TRY to make others believe, it's worth a watch."
1,Just horrible.,"This DVD is an atrocious piece of crap. The fake George is laughable, and obviously scripted, not an off-the-cuff 'testament' as purported (and for legal purposes, conjectured.) It's all too 'acted' for someone supposedly lying in a hospital bed after stab wounds the night before. The investigation into that tape by Highway 61 is also laughable, there are just too many incorrect and conflicting 'facts'. Whoever played George didn't get the Beatles' timeline correct, and in some cases, songwriters were miscredited. I love it when 'George' credits John with writing Only A Northern Song - a Harrison composition! He also goes in & out of some Cockney pronunciations, and is inconsistent with those as well. I wonder if the actor who voiced 'George' was even British? What an unashamed cash-in. This DVD was a complete waste of $13. Grrrrrrr......."
3,Can a Beatle really die?,"This is an interesting documentry. A lot of the ""facts"" are nothing new to a true beatle fan. I know it's probably unlikely that Paul was replaced, but in this day and age of hearing about this conspiracy and that conspiracy, it does make me wonder. Why did the beatles do the things they did on their album covers? Why did they say certain things in their songs? A friend of mine once told me that was part of their genius. Planting clues here and there, just to mess with the public. Anyway, the ""George"" tapes are clearly not his voice (was a voice over used?), but if you dig the beatles and don't know much about ""Paul Is Dead"", this movie is worth a viewing or three;)"
4,PAUL MCARTNEY IS REALLY DEAD,"This film documentary is not as awful as you would think.Some of it is fascinating. The film is narrated by a voice said tobe that of the late BEATLE GEORGE HARRISON.The film says that PAUL MCARTNEY was killedin a car acccident back in 1966,after an argument with JOHN LENNON.The rest asserts that a double was found to replace him. Though the film hassome credibility problems.Also some of the assertions of the facts don't seemcredible[ either intentional by the film makers or not]Still the recent revelationby PAUL MCARTNEY that his death was a hoax perpetrated by the BEATLES and, BRIAN EPSTEINfor some issue back in 1966.For that reason alone people should check this out.PAUL IN SAN JOSE,CALIFORNIA"
1,Say it Isn't So!,"Sorry to borrow the title of a Sigfried and Roy song, but I just can't believe the irrefutable evidence. Even though most of the music that's supposed to be attributed to Paul's death came out a year before he died, and even though the voice of ""George"" on a cassette sounds remarkably studio clear and not much like him at all, I buy into the WHOLE thing! If this is true, you know what that means? Fat guys in red come down the chimney when most homes don't have one anymore, it's good for children to sleep with their windows open at night, my beagle is the new messiah (he told me), and pink bunnies really DO poop multicolored eggs. Oh, joy; once again the world makes perfect sense!"
3,One More Anomaly,"Conspiracy theories really interest me whether I ultimately believe them or not. This movie didn't disappoint, but there are so many anomalies to the anomalies, I can't go along with it. Either this is propaganda pushed out by MI6 to cover up the cover up and throw us off with obvious errors, or the Highway 61 Entertainment is really silly.As so many people have already pointed out, the album dates vs. Paul's death don't coincide; Heather Mills looks too good to actually be in her 60s; and one of the biggest slips/errors in my opinion is when ""George Harrison"" refers to Paul being killed only 3 miles from the studio. Don't the British use kilometers?"
2,Beautiful...,"Just reading the title of this had me howling with laughter, and the movie did not let me down. Does anybody else find it hilarious when Borge (Bogus George) recounts the night when they were called to the accident scene ..he gives a detailed, gruesome description of Paul's burnt, decapitated, broken body and all of a sudden Maxwell pipes up ""He kinda looks like a walrus, doesn't he?"" Outraged, young Lennon proceeds to pummel Maxwell and shout ""I'm the walrus, dammit! I'M THE WALRUS!!!""Another high point is where Borge scoffs at how stupid Faul was to believe that they were going to India to study transcendental meditation when they were, in fact, going there so Mahareshi could attempt to steer Paul's soul into Faul's body.I must say, I'm a little disappointed that Brian Epstein's untimely (and suspicious) death wasn't written into the conspiracy. Too easy, maybe?"
1,too funny!,"my husband and I were watching this on Netflix and laughing, because we both thought it was such a funny spoof! guess the joke's on us; this is supposed to be real? LOL!"
1,"If that's George Harrison, then I'm Paul McCartney !!!","I cannot believe that the voice on the mini tapes is George Harrison's. It's ridiculous and it's rubbish. I've been a Beatles fan forever (showing my age) and I think I'd know George Harrison's voice, even on tape. To me the voice is not even Liverpudlian - it sounds a bit like a Kiwi. When so-call-George says the word ""Maxwell"" it sounds like he's saying ""Moxwell"". George had a real Liverpool accent, not the c**p on the tapes. Some of the mystery surrounding the so-called death of Paul McCartney has certainly been shattered by this utterly stupid DVD. Don't waste your money on buying it, I have a copy I'd be happy to give away !!!!!"
1,"Crazy, Rediculous and Down-Right Funny!! Disgusting too!!","As I watched this ""documentary"" on NetFlix I suddenly realized it is probably supposed to be a mockumentary (like ""Best in Show"", ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""Waiting for Guffman""). The voice of George Harrison was so funny I caught myself laughing...I mean it's so obviously a westerner with a terrible british accent. The implication that the security of Britain was compromised by the death of Paul McCartney was rediculously far-fetched as was the Beatles being sworn to secrecy by ""Maxwell"" (as in silver hammer?) under threat of death. If this film was not so gruesomely graphic in the details, I would have given it a higher rating on the laugh factor alone. However, this film is disgusting in it's bad taste and horrible images...about a person who is alive and well. Shame, Shame, Shame! May Maxwell's silver hammer come down upon the heads of the lunatics who made this shabby film!"
1,Utter garbage.,"Whether intended as cynical docudrama or as parody, it matters little. As a piece of filmmaking, it's utter garbage. ""Harrison's"" voiceover is lacking in any emotional resonance -- you'd think they could have at least gotten that bit right. Of all Beatles related artifacts, this film hits an all-time low."
1,"There's bad, then there's this!","Where do I begin? Within the first 2 words that you hear ""George"" speak you know it's not George Harrison. He's not even British. And the narration certainly didn't come from a low quality mini-cassette recorder. How stupid does this guy really think we are?! The director/producer Joel Gilbert used some of the original ""clues"" from the 60's and early 70's, then continued to make up a ton of new ones to fill out the movie. He would have you believe that everything The Beatles did after 1966 was totally and completely related to Paul's alleged death. They were trying to cover it up AND leave as many clues as possible? In every song and every bit of art work on every album?It's complete rubbish from beginning to end. (The only reason I gave this dvd 1 star is because you HAVE to give it at least one to get it to publish on this site) Can't believe there hasn't been a major law suite over this yet. Now that I would pay to see!"
1,"As a gag gift, maybe","This is one of those rare situations where something is so BAD, you should watch just to see HOW bad. It's one thing to do a ""Paul Is Dead"", project, and quite another to get so much of it wrong. They didn't even get a decent impressionist to do George Harrison's voice."
1,Don't bother watching.,"Really badly done.For all the research in to The Beatles they could have at least tried to get the accent right on the ""narrator"". It wasn't even English, let alone Liverpudlian!If you want to waste a few hours of your life, stare at a blank wall and give some money to charity. At least you will feel good about it afterwards."
1,The last testament of bogus material.,This video is a fake. Nothing in this film is real. Highway Entertainment should get a hard spanking from there mothers. Shame on you.
3,Interesting,It's very interesting! At first I thought that it was a spoof but after doing some research I learned that back in the 60's there were rumors going around that Paul McCartney was dead. I had to watch it a couple of times before I started believing the seriousness of the claim. To me it certainly explains the MAJOR change in the music the Beetles put out and the change in John Lennon's behavior.
1,Here's one for the Conspiracy Nuts,"Now I've never seen the entire movie but I did happen to catch some parts in a documentary. That a documentary was even produced on this absurd nonsense was a joke to me. What made it all the more laughable was the seriousness in the narrator's voice, like he really believed this crap himself. It also had some fake British bloke trying to imitate George Harrison's voice. Sounded like the guy that did his voice on the Yellow Submarine movie! Perhaps it actually was!! But you know, I still am not sure if it was meant to be serious or if it was just meant as a joke. Either way it is not worth spending one cent on it. Don't think I would even be interested in viewing the whole thing if it was given to me for free."
3,MURDER IN WINE COUNTRY,"This entry in the PAX TV Mary Higgins Clark series is a fairly entertaining whodunit. The pace is a little slow and Jennifer Clement's over the top performance as the loyal maid borders on parody, but it's story of the murder of a wine magnate's wife is intriguing and there are a few surprises along the way. Cynthia Gibb is effectively plucky as Freddie, the wine heiress, and Sebastian Spence is well cast as her old flame. Gordon Currie is a little too ""prissy"" as her husband, and the aforementioned Clements is so demented that it's like watching an old Bette Davis movie. But I enjoy a good mystery and this one managed to be entertaining."
4,CD,"I did not have any problems with the seller, bit I am not giving 5 stars because I thought that this was a CD full of bohemia style songs or boleros and it is not."
4,...,"this is one of my all time favorite anime series..EVER!i watched gatchaman since it's conception back in the day..even the horridly butchered abomination that was BATTLE OF THE PLANETS.Gatchaman(94) kicks ASS by condensing some of the plotlines from the old series and revamping it with new animation,cool character designs, vehicles and a new score to accompany the original soundtrack. the theme song ""let's fly""(LYRICS BY EARTH WIND AND FIRE'S MAURICE WHITE) adds a touch of soul to the 3 parter.a mix of the old and new.although the dub version is decent, at best..purists such as me would rather watch it subbed. the last 50 seconds of the OVA were sentimental and along with a mini video playing a more techno version of gatchaman pays a great homage to a great seriesthanks tatsunoko/urban vision.i give it 4 out of 5 stars becausei wouldv'e loved to have seen more..it was short but fun while it lasted."
2,This is *not* for G-Force fans!,"As a child I was an avid G-Force fan. I would watch every morning before school and as I grew up and discovered more about this wonderful world of anime. I realized that the G-Force I watched (as well as Battle of the Planets) was an American release of the Japanese ""Science Ninja Team: Gatchaman"". Now that anime has started flooding the US marketplace (thank you!) I finally found this... a coveted ""Gatchman"" DVD, a sweet memory of my youth. But, when I popped it in I didn't see the characters I remembered. No 7-Zark-7, no Pee-wee, no Ace... and no ""G-FORCE"" team yell. What I came to discover, is this was a re-labelled 3 episode set of what was shown on tv more recently as ""Eagle Riders"". So, yeah, it's technically a modern Gatchaman... but if you're expecting the original, you may be disappointed. If none of this made sense, enjoy the show... it's still pretty good."
1,not what you think,"If you are looking for Hallelujah Live with Kurt Nilsen et al, this is NOT IT. I don't know how it got associated with it, but if you look under Espen Lind, you will find it. I do highly recommend the other Hallelujah Live, it is an excellent album."
5,God's Mountain,My relatives were part of this history so it was very interesting read and I bought this copy for my brother.
2,Torture Is Right !,"OK - it's not THAT bad, but this very minor entry in euro-horror surely lacks in entertainment value. Except for a few delirious scenes of women tied up and tortured by the disfigured man-creature, this movie is mostly just a big giant bore. Characters talk endlessly as the mystery unfolds. Is the lead woman the reincarnation of a long-dead ancestor???? Who cares. Ya, it's that story you've seen a million times...you know the one - where the painting on the wall resembles the lead character. Z-z-z-z-z-z-z. Skip this Tomb of Torture and seek out the Bloody Pit of Horror instead! The DVD has no extras."
5,Exquisite! Delicious!,"A delicious movie filled with love, food, and revolution. Captures beautifully the situations so many found themselves in during the Soviet revolution. The acting is SUPERB [there's neither a judge nor a lawyer in sight, so the other review attached to this movie musts have been meant for another film]. The cinematography is exquisite. Pierre Richard plays a fascinating Frenchman--a combination opera singer, chef, and retired gigolo--who falls in love first with a Georgian princess, and then with her country and its cuisine. Tragic and beautiful. My only complaint: you can't buy the soundtrack...Too bad because it is probably the very best thing about the film."
4,Absolutely Awesome - But The Wheels In Photo Are Deceptive,"This sucker is an AWESOME case. Seriously awesome. Like all Pelican products, it's gonna be around longer than me. But the wheels in the photo do not come with the case. I should have read more carefully and not trusted my eyes. That being said...why have a photo with an accessory that isn't included with the case? Kinda deceptive.Anyways, buy it with confidence. This case rocks."
1,Poor teaching. Too much fusion. Reused material!,"Some of these moves are very difficult even for experienced bellydance students (beginners - forget it!), and Suhaila doesn't break them down and doesn't explain. On the other hand, some exercises are too simple and boring and don't require a bellydance or pilates instructor. Still some other exercises are weird and made me doubt if they are useful for dancers or anybody at all. I was disappointed that there was much less dancing here than I expected. I also felt gypped: there is some overlap of exercises between different DVDs of this set."
1,Incorrect format--discs not compatible,"I am giving this one star not because of the content (which I can't even view), but because the DVD format is listed incorrectly and now I have to return this. It's actually DVD-9, which means it's a dual-layer DVD, NOT a standard single-layer DVD. Your player has to be specifically coded to play this, and none of mine are. Had the DVD format been listed CORRECTLY, I wouldn't have purchased this."
3,not 4 me,She is not your average instructor. Love her personality and her willingness to experiment but could not follow her cause is did not seem like she really had a good flow of belly dancing. I was trying watch a few others but they would not keep the camera on them long enough. Her form to me was not so great. The routines were not enough muscle memory oriented which is what I was looking for.
1,just buy JAZZ and YOGA AND don't wate your money,"THE OTHER 2 BUNS AND PILATES IS THE SAME AND ""B O R I N G""[...]I KEPT THE 2 THAT I ONLY LIKE WICH ARE JAZZ AND YOGA.I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING WITH MORE RYTHYM AND FUN, MORE ACTIVITY, NOT SOMETHING LIKE; STRECH, AND GO DOWN AND THE SAME THE WHOLE DVD.I THINK I WILL TRY RANIAS BELLYDANCE FITNESS, I AM A LITTLE BITSKEPTICAL BECAUSE OF THE FEEDBACKS, BUT I'LL GIBVE IT A TRY I SAW A LITTLE BIT OF HER VIDEOS ON HER WEBSITE [...]i LET YOU KNOW, HOW WAS IT."
4,I love Suhaila!,"This is my 1st introduction to belly dance, so I am a true beginner. Suhaila is wonderful! She is very genuine and explains things well. My favorite of the 4 is the Pilates. It really works stomach, legs, and buns. The Buns DVD is good, too, if you don't mind the repetition. Jazz looks great, but as a true beginner, I will need to watch it tons of times before I'll come close to keeping up. The Yoga DVD is a little slow. On each DVD, there are performances by Suhaila and her dance company- vert beautiful. She also has a short interview section on each DVD, and she is so honest and encouraging. Over all, I have been quite pleased! Oh! And after just a few weeks with the pilates DVD, I have new muscles in my legs & stomach! Yahoo!"
4,Belly Dance Fusion,"This is an excellent instructional video that tones the muscles used in belly dance; however, it it isn't just belly dance moves... and it isn't for beginner. I highly recommend this video for those who are familiar with belly dance and are ready for a further challenge."
1,this is a bootleg not a licensed shirt,licensed shirts are professionally screen-printed. I can't imagine why Amazon has allowed this on here. I am reporting this infringing item to the legitimate copyright holder
5,Safe Classrooms/Intelligent Schools,"Practical, concrete suggestions for teachers (and to a lesser extent, parents) who want to understand how to promote children's social and emotional skills and knowledge. There are so many programs and perspectives 'out there' - this book helps to make sense of it - As a practicing teacher, I loved it and found it actually helpful in my classroom work."
5,Muddy Waters Tribute,A must have for music lovers - - before this type of information is lost to history. A good visual treat to a master and foundation of american blues...
4,simple and elegant,"I was looking a digital, but this watch caught my attention. It was no very formal but very casual, and I like it, maybe it doesn't had the functions that had digital watch, but the design is simple but elegant."
1,I haven't see it yet,"I can review this watch, This is time and the watch isn't arrive yet to me. Waht can I do to know what is happened it with this product? Am very worried about it. Tks."
3,Laundry Caddy,"This item shipped within it's delivery estimate. The Caddy is a great design but it has cheap particle board. I have otheritems made from particle board that is much denser, this is not.The front bottom board split on one side my hubby fixed it.however the board on the other side is splitting now. he will also have to fix that.I don't believe this product will last very long. Lucky if I get six months useI don't recomend anyone buy it. this is defintely not worth the money."
5,"Got it for a friend and he was all like ""Yes.""",I don't know how the game is because I didn't play it but from the looks of it it was just fine.
1,Christmas Present Arrives with No Outer Box - Just Product Box!,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my husband and it came with no outer box... just the product's box with a shipping label.... so it totally spoiled the surprise, as my husband came home from work first and saw it. I didn't see anything that indicated that on the site."
3,Does the job - BUT,"I've had this kit for a couple of years now. I like to really test something before reviewing.The reflector - it's a nice, 5 in 1 reflector - each side of the reflector, and the diffusor inside, does it's job well and without fuss. The zipper is cheap, and can get stuck, but thats not a deal breaker.The stand - Cheap. The arm that clips onto the reflector fits well, but the socket for hooking over the top of the light stand itself doesn't fit well and isn't very secure. The light stand itself has plastic clips and each extension tube - with wear - will come out from it's socket. Again, does the job, but ...This kit got me going with my lighting education - it works and does it's job, but won't hold up to years of gentle, part time use, never mind professional daily abuse."
4,Got what I paid for,"For the price I paid I was expecting something of very little quality. I needed something fast for a project and did not want to spend too much money. Easy and inexpensive setup, perfect price for the quality."
5,Excellent Reflector & fair Price,"I bought this reflector for my studio lighting. This WESTCOTT product is absolutly a high quality product for serious photogrpahers and personally i high recommend to buy it. I'm very satisfied with the product and price. I'll buy other reflector soon..maybe the square one or the same kit. Shipping was more faster i thought, i got it 2nd day after i bought. fast uhm? ;)"
4,"Quality reflectors...poor stand (or should I say ""boom"")","These reflectors are VERY large and GREAT quality. They are worth the money...HOWEVER, the weight of the reflectors, when on the stand, make it top heavy. You'll have to anchor it with sand bags. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase. In my opinion, the reflectors alone are worth the money. the stand is okay... the ""boom"" is the issue. Additionally, the clips that hold the reflector on can be a REAL pain to get on. A diagram of how to put them on would have made life a LOT easier the first time. I am giving the 4 rating based on the size and quality of the reflectors."
4,Sultry Western,"In The Renegades (Nick), Genell Dellin creates the typical woman trying to resist man who is trying to resist the woman conflict. Do they succomb to passion in the heat of the 1890's Cherokee Strip? Well, what do YOU think! This book is a good read, one that often puts a smirk on your face because of Dellin's use of humor and imagery. Characters are believable and likeable, but probably won't be your all-time favorites. The hero, Nick, has great pecs, lots of bronzed, warm skin and has a quirky since of humor. The heroine, Callie, is a luscious blond who is pregnant with someone else's baby, and she is fighting Nick over a claim in a land lottery. The book is sexy, yet not really graphic. It rates about a 6 on the Steam scale (one being cool and 10 being hot, hot, hot)."
1,Skip it,"this book is not worth the time, money or energy,i felt like the story begun out of nowhere and ended much the same it could have done much better i don't know why the characters were not fully developed i think this should be avoided it had a good plot but written very badly."
3,OK. But the movie was better.,Books are usually better than the movies. But this is an exception. I felt a better grasp of all the characters involved from watching the movie than I did reading the book. That's not to say the book was not a good read. It was. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Definitely worth reading. But please also watch the movie.
3,gripping...until the unfortunate ending,"This book is certainly a page turner. Rynn, the 'little girl who lives down the lane,' is a creepy little mystery of a girl. What is she hiding in the cellar? Where exactly is her father?I couldn't wait to find out, and when I did, it was interesting, but the plot line began to bleed afterwards. I could feel the author puppeteering his characters, never a good thing; plot devices were used that felt a bit too convenient, causing the story to lose its' credibility.The ending was pure baloney. What was going on with the tea cups? I closed the book feeling unsatisfied- a real dissappointment when comparing it to how gripped I was at the beginning. Boo-hoo."
1,Don't waste your money on these,I purchased and installed two of these about 4 months ago to replace the original Price Pfister parts after 10 years of use. Yesterday one started leaking and I took it apart to find a broken ceramic disk.
4,Grizzley Trammel points,"These are a well made copy of the Stanley #4 trammel point, ( collector item 50.00)You will also find these by Kunz (green and 35.00), and several others...What is the difference? Black paint, and these are 7.00/...All trammel points work the same, they clamp on a stick, and draw a circle...I use mine on a 4 foot metal ruler, laying flat instead of standing up...."
2,Won't hold on to the pencil,"The price is certainly right, but if you intend to draw large radius circles (which we do all of the time making scenery) the pencil keeps falling out of the holder. We ended up having to tape it in."
3,Must have in workshop,This is fine and is simply a must have in any decent workshop. I keep it permanently set in a wooden rule.
4,Nice little set at a reasonable price,"I try to buy used or vintage tools whenever I can, but trammel points are generally priced out of my reach in the used tool market. Why? You tell me. But I'm a user, not a collector, so this set, at the price, is exactly what I was looking for.I use mine with scraps of maple (of different lengths for convenience). That way I can mark on the shaft at will.I admit that it would be nice if the pencil holder held anything but a number 2 pencil, but since that's all I use in the shop, I'm content with this purchase and am happy to recommend the product."
3,For preparing a basic class,Full of excercises is a good refreshing for a person who has not be exposed for a while to logic. Nevertheless for a 1st time reader might be a bit confusing on the organization of the subjects.
3,I don't use these as much as I would like to,"I don't like the fact that these magnetic measuring spoons are not dishwasher safe. They are sturdy but I am still worried that too much soaking in the sink while I wash dishes will separate the magnet from the spoon. All in all, I like having a teaspoon and tablespoon out and easy to reach at all times. The magnet is very strong so they work well as fridge magnets."
2,Fake Reviews/OK Book,"I agree. Too many of these reviews look fake to me. Same day and 5 stars and flatter too much. Without little doubt I would consider many of these reviews to me marketing.That is not right. Amazon should do something about this to ensure the integrity of these reviews.Anyhoo, this book is decent. I'd recommend this book to mid-level managers in big firms who went to college after the tech revolution. Might have good insights for you.But for a small firm these ideas dont work. And if you already are even broderline tech savvy, this book is not good. Basically just rehashes what everyone already knows.If this book were written in the mid90s i would have recommended it to more people. But frankly, it is outdated now. This book came out a decade late.I give it two stars. not horrible but not worht the money."
1,Outdated,I do NOT recommend reading this book. It is sooo outdated. Maybe this book would have salience in the mid-90s before the tech boom.Most companies understand the issues laid out in the book now.
5,A Thought Provoking Read,"Well, I enjoyed reading this book. It was not a light read. My feeling is that a broader set of concepts is there, and some of it sounds similar to the typical book about improving your business, but if you really think through the ten chapters and how they define a technology executive, then you see this is a new approach. So I recommend this book for you if you will take the time to read it. The introduction and early chapters feel a little dated, references to Enron, etc. before the meltdown, but keep reading."
3,"Great romance, but a bit creepy","Dirick and Meris are an inspiring couple whose love withstands multiple obstacles. The beginning of their romance is beautiful and probably worth reading the book for. I particularly loved the fact that Dirick not only accepts Meris's oddities, such as her devotion to the villagers, but he embraces that part of her. Where the book goes wrong is the creepy disgusting parts. The fact that ther are two blood relatives competing to marry Meris is a bit absurd. There is also a weird serial killer plot line, and it is very strange who it is that turns out to be the serial killer. My guess is that serial killers are a modern phenomena and were unnecessary in such a brutal age. Another problem for me is how difficult it is for Meris and Dirick to clear up their misunderstanding. All in all a good book, but it had the potential to be much better."
1,Total waste of money...BEWARE,"While there is some good biographical information about Jerry's life, this video contains NO GRATEFUL DEAD OR JERRY GARCIA MUSIC !!! I'm sure that it was a copyright issue, and this cheap-o company could not afford to pay for the rights.A tribute to Garcia without his music is like a tour of the Sistine Chapel in the dark...""Well, it's a really pretty ceiling, but you just gotta believe me on that one""And what's with the long flashbacks to 50's TV shows? Disturbing and disappointing."
4,A must-own for any collector,"Joe Phillips' newest book contains some of the most stunning, inspiring artistic depictions of carefree and fun-loving young men anywhere. Phillips is perhaps best known for his work for Xodus Magazine and Jocko Underwear, but the glossy, full-color air-brushed drawings in this book are pure art. The only criticism for this book is that several of the images have been published previously in calendar form (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Simultaneously both homoerotic and tasteful, this beautifully bound volume is essential to any serious collector of homoerotica or cartoons/comics."
5,Wonderful,"As usual Kenneth Hagin was right on point and precise what I needed to hear,a true rhema word in season. I recommend this book to everyone"
3,No tsuper satisified,"Did not last long. But you get what you pay for. Ok for college dorms maybe, but not a home"
2,Just a sample of different workouts,I guess I didn't read the description carefully enough. This is just a promo for all their different workouts.. not very good. I basically paid for one of their advertisements.
3,Quick delivery,Received the product quickly from supplier. Not as happy with the card but it does the job.
5,It works and you must keep it up!,"I have been taking St. Johns off and on for about several years now. I will tell you straight up that when i stopped taking then everything went down hill for me as far as my depression and other issues. I just started back again in the New Year to get a grip of myself and deal with all my issues. I take this along with L-TYROSINE and i have noticed a huge difference in me. I am much more focused, no anxiety, sleep like a baby, and really able to get alot of things accomplished. So, this is part of my daily process and i do not leave anywhere without. It does take a while to get into your system which is about a month or so but you will see the difference."
3,St John's Wort,This product is much stronger than previous versions I've taken and upset my stomach alot. Had to discontinue use and I just ordered a brand new bottle too.
2,NOT FOR ME,"After going through a lot of reviews i decided to give it a try , i've been taking it for about 3 months now after deciding to quit using prescribed antidepressants, what make me feel very good but i started getting a lot of weight, so i went ahead and got me the ST JONH'S WORT 300mg and it has done nothing for mei feel the same way i felt before without the antidepressants and sadly i haven't notice any change on my mood, sleeping or stress that is why i give it a very low review , i just ordered the 5 HTP, i really hope this one really works because i need to feel better...Source Naturals St. John's Wort Std Ext 300mg, 240 tablets"
3,good product but not sure if it works,"I bought this for a family member. She has depression and I hoped that it would help her. She took it (3 every day) for a couple of months and did not feel any better. Well, that's self-medication I guess. People with real depression should see a doc for help instead of hoping some herbal pills would help... my bad"
3,"Great movie, awful DVD","See the other reviews for words on the great performances and natural energy of this film; I want to warn everyone off this sub-standard DVD version.First off, the disc is 2-sided -- the last 45 minutes of the movie are on side 2 and the side break is extremely abrupt. The film is only about 2-1/2 hours long, it should comfortably fit on a dual-layer disc. Second, the film is presented in full screen, not letter-boxed in any way. Finally, the first side has some strange defect where the chapter/time elapsed are not available or displayed.This is supposed to be a ""Special Edition""!"
2,A Woman Under the Influence,Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands give excellent proformances----very moving----but the story is a little off beat and certainly not a happy or cheerful movie
3,Unhappy with this DVD,"I expected a better edition of this movie title. To use a photography term, it was unsharp, it required a disc turnover to complete viewing and their were no special features, such as professional commentary, which I know is available. I was very disappointed with this disc."
5,NOT ABOUT ALCOHOL,"I'm not sure what film Nancy Price is referring to, but Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence has nothing to do with ""alcoholism."""
3,SHORT! This item is just 32 Pages!,"Useful and simple, a thin booklet about how to string beaded flowers on wire. Geared to different arrangements/different varieties of flowers."
3,"Good, but not worth the cost","This was the first book I was able to find on the craft of beaded flowers, hence the only reason I shelled out $20 for the thinnest manual I've ever seen. These days if you do a search many how-to books pop up; most of which I'd recommend before buying this one. I've read about a dozen of them now, and while this particular pamphlet has a lot of good information and a few patterns--any of the other books offer just the same (if not better) instructions and patterns. When I look at it in comparison with the other resources available, I'm disappointed I spent so much on so little."
2,Not enough images,"The images of the actual flowers were too small to actually see any detail.Although the directions of each step are shown in the front of the book, I find that I have to keep turning the pages back when making each flower. I am a beginner but I thought there were too many written and hard to understand directions.It is also a very small book for $19.95."
3,It's ok . . .,"This is an ok book, but the directions are fairly confusing. Other than that, it's an good book."
5,Good enough to buy,"This tape consists of the best TV moments, and is fastinating. The viewers are given a honest history of the locations that adds to the atmosphere.Fans of the show or those with an interest in the paranormal should pick up a copy!"
4,"I expected more, but still the show I remember","I'm not sure if all the episodes are the same, but the tape I received follows Pentagram University in Athens, Ohio, Axe Murder House in Villisca, Ohio, and Hayden Bridge Exorcism. the tape is narrated by Linda Blair and is the same show presented by Fox Family. It was sufficiently creepy and the VHS tape is in good working condition, if they release the series as a set I would definitely buy it."
2,Next Spooky Ghost Story Please!,"I'm into the supernatural,and remember watching this around Halloween.I think they still show it, come the season.The premise is the tale being retold, followed by 1st hand accounts of sightings, and other unusual findings. They return to the area in question, with cameras showing their faces throughout the venture. I'm not sure but I don't recall showing the suspected haunted area, and few noises, other than the explorers freaking out.This show lacks depth, and somewhat motivation. They could have referenced old town records, and or historians of the affected area, and areas. Most of the talk here comes from teens, looking for excitement.Adults unfortunately rarely take these adolescents seriously."
3,WARTIME PROPAGANDA,"Many of the Hollyood studios went to work to make anti-Japan and Anti-Nazi films for good reasons and to raise some encouragement and hope on the home front. It wasn't exactly a traditional war film - most of the action was between the military guys themselves and of course, between John and Maureen. Randolph Scott played his typical good guy, strong-dude role, and was believeable as the DI instructor at boot camp. The marching was good, as lead by Scott carrying his sword, as was some of the interaction between the Marines. If I had been a young lad in 1942, this film probably would have convinced me to join up. Semper fidelis!"
1,The DVD version is misrepresented.,"I bought a copy of the DVD version of this movie which I had seen in the theatres many years ago. When I started the movie I noticed it was in black and white, not in color as the movie was photographed in and what the DVD jacket said it was in. Thinking the DVD was defective, I returned it. I then went to another place and bought another copy. It too was in black and white. I sent e-mails to Fox asking what was wrong and never received an answer. I strongly recommend that you do not buy the DVD version. Too bad, the movie actually is very good."
3,The way it really wasn't,"Playboy John Payne joins the Marines, makes time with pretty nurses, beats up Randolph Scott, his DI, (how we all wished we could have but never dared), gets out, hears about (Japanese) attack on Pearl Harbor, sees old outfit marching to the troop ship, decides right there and then to re-enlist. Only during the War would a movie like this have been made. I loved it and so will any Marine."
4,"Hokey - yes, but I like it.","Okay, Okay - by modern standards, this film is very hokey. A real flag-waver that gets cheesier as it progresses. But I love the on-screen combination and chemistry of Maureen O'Hara and John Payne. Their first of 4 films together, this movie was actually being film when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The script and ending were quickly changed to reflect the headlines and the sentiment of the day. The film was rushed in to theaters within a few months of completion and became a big poster for enlistment.Most modern audiences know Payne and O'Hara from the Christmas classic, ""Miracle on 34th Street"", which is their third pairing. Their second (""Sentimental Journey"" ) and forth (""Tripoli"", a Paramount release) are not available on either VHS or DVD - what a shame."
1,NOT IN COLOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Though the product details say that it is in color, the movie is in BLACK & WHITE!!! Mine was a 2002 DVD. In large print it says ""PHOTOGRAPHED IN TECHNICOLOR"" but in small print below the story description it says ""1942, B&W, 86 Minutes"".... Cover art front and back are in color but the two small snapshots of the movie on the back are in black and white. If you got a color DVD you got lucky."
5,The only complete field guide for the birds of India.,"I used this book for three years while living in India. While its illustrations are not as robust or detailed as those of western field guides, they are usually adequate. First, and foremost, though, is that this volume is currently the ONLY book that contains all the species. Others contain a mere fraction. For that reason alone, this is the one book you should get for IDing birds in India. The rest lead only to disappointment, unless used in conjunction with this one.This book is the illustration subset of the much larger Handbook, which comes in a 10-volume set (or in one tiny-print ""compact"" volume). The two work well together: one for your field forays, and one for the bookshelf back home. Be warned, though: the compact Handbook, while an exhaustive study of each species (including migration maps and exhumed stomach contents, etc.) is expensive when you can find it."
5,Series 14-1992,"I started watching ""Last of the Summer Wine"" from the very first series and all of the ones that are out on dvds. Hopefully all the series (31 in all plus Christmas specials) will be out soon. The writing of the series is great and if you like good acting these shows might be good for you. It does take a few shows to get into the characters, so hang on and you'll be glad you did."
5,Keep this series coming,I cannot add any other words to my review that I have'nt alread stated. This a true classic British comedy. Never seems dated even though it began in 1975.
3,Really interesting premise... doesn't live up to its potential.,"In a lot of ways, I really enjoyed this movie. The mind-readers, the fact that the government controls them and uses them for their own ends, the bleakness of their existence - they don't tend to live past age 28... The concept is great - the execution? Not so much.John's (Nick Stahl) attempt to save his life, and learn the truth after meeting someone who has his ability and is still alive after age 30, is very riveting and interesting. I also enjoyed the dialogue and exploration of human relationships, being ""other"", and the human condition.However, Nick Stahl's portrayal of John seemed hollow to me. I really didn't buy that the other character would fall in love with John. The special effects were laughable, and took away from an otherwise intriguing premise. The ending was very unsatisfying and very much a WHU-?If you're bored, and don't have much else to do, then by all means, watch this film."
3,short story it was based on,"As we were watching this movie, my wife knew what was going to happen & correctly predicted the ending and other details which she said were from a short science fiction story she remembered reading. But the product description mentions neither story nor its author. Now our curiosity is awakened. Does anyone remember the name of the short story or author?"
3,Where Pigeons Go to Die Book Review,"R. Wright Campbell develops a very deep metaphoric story of a man's last wish before dying and a bird's struggle with life during a flight home. Anyone who trains or even likes birds, would enjoy this story much more than I, but it is a story with a very deep meaning and can be looked upon in several different ways from any perspective.The story focuses on a young boy, Hugh, who faces a struggle with a very beloved grandfather who becomes ill. Hugh also is worried about his cherished bird ""Dickens"" who is his number one bird. Dickens is many miles away, making his way back home. Hugh, the young boy is faced with being separated with the two most important things in his life at the same time, and learns to cope the best that a ten-year old boy knows how. Hugh realizes the similarity of his grandfather to his beloved pigeon; he sees that both just want to be back in their own bed. The story is easy to follow and can be enjoyed by any age group."
4,"The Next Step - Not for Beginners, but Good!","Teneriffe patterns, knot start, fitting a lid, fancy stitches, caning, two-part handles, and projects using these techniques. Illustrated with drawings and photos of finished projects. Also, construction of wire shapes and outlines for teaching. Not basic coiling information, for experienced coilers."
1,Two of the discs did not work.,"We received a baby genius dvd as a gift and our son likes most of it. However, the adults in our family find the baby genius shows to be visually irritating and the music just so so (adults do not feel good while watching this). Compare this to ""Baby Signing Time"" which is visually interesting/ soothing and has fantastic music that the whole family enjoys.Anyway, I ordered this set based on the great reviews, but two of the DVDs would not play all the way through so we returned it. I see a lot of other folks have complained of the same problems. Looks like Amazon has a bad batch."
1,Very poorly procuced DVD,"These DVDs are very poorly made. The songs & the pictures don't match. After we watched once, we don't want to watch them again. Instead, I went to buy the ""Baby Einstein"" series for our 15 months son which he's been watching over & over again and never gets tired of it. It's of much better quality, very educational & entertaining. One of the DVD we received from the""Baby Genius"" series won't even play're very disappointed. One thing we've learnt is we'll never buy another prouduct of Baby Genius ever again. It's a brand name to distrust--poor quality."
3,"Beautifully composed, but a contrived plot.",Unbelievably intricate mystery to unravel. Much more like a puzzle than a story. Not my style.
2,not a big fan,"i was rather disappointed when i first hit this head,i like the fact that its durable but i seems as if the thickness of the head dampens its sound an awful lot,it may just be my tuning but im currently not a fan,i bought this head with the remo emperor tom heads, the tom heads are awesome i love their sound but the snare was an utter disappointment"
2,Way too thick,"This is the most durable head you can buy, but it deadens the sound of your snare way too much. I guess this could work for super-heavy-hitters and metal drummers, but otherwise, I don't recommend it."
3,It's Alright.,"The Remo Emperor X is an alright head. It's just a lot thicker than I was anticipating. Due to the thickness I have a really hard time getting the sound I want which is high pitched with a lot of pop. This head, believe it or not, leaves a lot to be desired. I hear a lot of overtones with very little snare. Probably won't be ordering this head in the future."
2,not for me,"Not very exciting, this head takes away all the character from both my snare drums. It's a very solid head though, will probably last very long but it has not a lively sound. Sounds flat/dull and does not allow you to get a lot of different sounds from your snare."
5,Great tool in the reference library of a primary teacher,Great addition to my library as a newby teaching ELAs. It clearly defines many of the tricky rules that exist within the english language
5,A Truly Bang-Up Job by Christopher Fee,"Extremely fascinating text! It is no surprise Oxford University Press chose to publish this work. Whether the reader is a scholar specializing in the folklore of the British Isles, a student enrolled in a Viking seminar, or an individual with an interest in the topic, this work is informative and captivating. The text not only aids the reader in his or her study of British Isle folklore, but allows the reader to draw connections between Scandinavian culture on the mainland and other isles. I have read a fair amount of works concerning this topic, but none have kept me as interested as ""Gods, Heroes, & Kings."" A definite buy!"
4,Great text,"I have this book for a class I am taking for teaching. Great history of the state, not to technical and very easy read. Great even for high school reading."
5,Exactly as it appears...,Looks like the picture. Good value. The wife loved it. Not for little ones since the chain is delicate.
1,Can't install this in my server,"It claims to fit in any 5.25"" bay, but the rails and the fan come in two parts, and your 5.25"" bay needs to have an extra set of screw holes or wide slots at the front or you won't be able to screw in both the rails and the fan. The machine I intended to install this on has a pair of short slots that are sufficient for normal 5.25"" devices, but will not allow me to attach both the rails and the fan."
3,Mostly impressive,"Chang makes a compelling, convincing case that the end is almost nigh for our friends in Beijing. I'd give a higher rating were the writing more supple.Still, a worthy, interesting read."
1,So funny!,"I knew the existance of this book for a while but never had a chance to read it. I checked it out this time to read it only for fun! Indeed, it is amusing reading it and comparing what was predicted in the book with the reality. Mr. Chang definitely had an ax to grind when he wrote this book. Don't waste your breath to argue the right or wrong of his arguments! He hates China! In fact, he could not care less about Chinese people! That is it! Period! Read it for a laugh! Don't waste your time to get serious with him!"
1,Another Opportunist Write Try Earn Money From Sensationalism,"Just Another Writer Try To Ride On US Cold War Overhanged (before the Sept 11) and earn money by bad mouthing China. All the contents are the writer own cheap opinion and lousy prediction. Doesn't sound like a book written by lawyer to me as he openly ignore many positive things about China and only mentioning (with big sensationalism) about negative sides of China (or may be that is what lawyer train to do by who knows whom financing him to write this book). Too bad, after Sept 11, US finally know that China is not an enemy and woke up from Cold War over-hanged (in the recent 20 years, Chinese never killed any American, not even slap them, but Islamic Extremists have killed many many American around the world and swear to kill much more). Gordon Chang is just another opportunist that missed his opportunity after Sept 11."
1,It's really entertaining,"Only time can prove or disaprove a prediction. But now after 6 years when you read this book, how funny it is. China didn't collaps, but western country collaps by the over leveraged financial system.Acutally a similar article titled ""the coming collaps of western system"" (mimic Chang's book title) dated on feb, 2005 in China's internet now proved very accurate.No matter how true his point sounds like, time prove Chang is nothing but a talker, he know nothing about China, and know nothing about US where he livesA pure junk!A shameless cheater!"
1,The Coming Callapse?,I can't believe Amazon is still selling this piece of junk. The book was published in 2001 and every country is now still looking up to China for a way out of the financial crisis started in 2007/2008. I happened to see a link in a very recent comment by this guy on yahoo fiance and the link brought me here. I came across this book before and never have any intention either to buy it or read it. Just by looking at the fact that the book was published in 2001 and in 2013 China is still going strong should make you think twice before you buy and read it! Why do you want to waste your money on this book?
2,Over emotional,I've always feel sad when overseas Chinese being overly critical on China after the influence of the Western(esp. US) propaganda.The author seemed too biased and I found difficulties in finishing the book.
1,Xie is dead on the money,"Chang is politically correct but his so-called ""twenty years working in China"" was apparently a waste. Somehow he managed to miss what's truly going on in China. Chang's use of numbers betrays a refusal to even consider the facts."
5,Startling!,"We Americans view the world with wide-eyed innocence. We see ourselves as no threat to anyone. We feel that we are little threat to the ideologies of others. That explains why we think other nations are just as harmless. Gordon Chang is about to startle everyone.A superb writer, Mr. Chang takes you on a high-speed ride just as exciting as a mystery thriller. The problem is that this is reality - dangerous reality. You will put ""The Coming Collapse of China"" down only to check Chang's facts.You may disagree with Chang and that will make him happy; At the very least, you will have been challenged and you will have learned. If you happen to disagree and to be right, Chang will be giddy with joy. Neither of these things is likely. China has a dark cloud over it and you will feel the storm."
1,Gordon Chang Mea Culpa,"Go to Jamestown.org to read Gordon Chang professing his complete and utter ignorance -- slight exageration. Like all China experts (economists more or less excluded), Gordon Chang was trying to paint a picture of the place by viewing it through a straw.I shouldn't rag on him too much. When facts repudiate his early analysis, at least he is man enough to retract his more egregious assessments.So Gordon Chang gets 3 stars for sucking it up and being a man... but his book still deserves 1 Star."
1,highly opinionated - few concrete facts,"Motivated by a recent visit to China I have begun reading a few books on the subject. G. Chang's has disappointed not so much because it is very pessimistic (as I am certain there are many reasons to be) but rather because of the few facts he delivers. There is a lot of repetitive argument but little to substantiate. For example the accession of China to the WTO is mentioned every so often as an immense problem, yet there is no concrete mention of the sort of problems this will bring China."
1,Time to revisit,"In 2001, I read the book based on some friend's recommendation. What a waste of time! The book is shallow and biased, sometimes an incidental comedy. The author, who is said to have lived in China for 20 years, is apparently blind to all the positive changes from 1978 to 2000. Comparing 1999 China to 1999 USA, of course China had tons of problems. However, what Gordon failed to see is the upward trend. Now, when the name of the book came up in a conversation, I could not help looking back: 3 years have passed since the publishing of the book; China has kept a high growth rate amid the global recession. The investment kept pouring in. It has weathered the SARS reasonably well even with a slow start. More importantly, its domestic market has grown enough so export is not the sole pillar of the economy anymore. Coming collapse? Dream on.Glad I didn¡t buy the book. On a second thought, I should get a copy that someone threw away, so I could have a laugh when I want."
2,What a disappointment,The author deserves praise for bringing the opposite view. Too often books are too positive about China and the fact is China is still a communist country with no democracy or freedom of speech.If China will collapse is doubtfull but there are definetly threats to the existance of the communist party. The disappointing things is that this book doesn't present a clear view on how this will happen. All it does is describing an endless flow of stories about all the things that are not functioning in China. That didn't bring any new insight too me because all these stories have been told so many times. Finally in the end of the book the author tries to describe several scenarios which could lead to the collapse of China. Unfortunatly he only use 10 pages to describe 4 scenarios which is hardly enough to create some substance.My final conclusion is that it's good that somebody brings some contrary views but what a pity it's of such a bad quality
1,The fact will tell us the crazy wrong of this book!,"This book is really a crazy one that I have ever read!Like all of the failure predictions in the past two decades about the future of China, this prediction will be proven wrong again sadly!If the author could gamble with me for about 100 million dollars, I 'm sure he will lost everything, and become a beggar!China will be not going to collapse, but becoming more and more prosperous, and one day becomes the world No. 1 in term of all aspects economical, military, culture and technology, so no any other countries in the world would stop such a trend!He is a cheater and only thing he wants is to collect money from those who want China to be collapsed!!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"This book offers no insights in identifying key challenges and opportunities facing China as a country in a transitional economy. Worse, it is clearly biased and illogical to the extent I felt insulted that such book could be published. If you want to take an objective and in-depth look at China, read ""Rediscovering China : Dynamics and Dilemmas of Reform"" by Li Cheng."
1,Worthless!,"Please add the following to the review I sent you earlier today (CET).- Insert 'Yuan' after 'Sung' and before 'Ming' in the list of Emperor-dynasties.- To the end of my text add 'If China splits into separate states, as she has done before, then the contest between these ""Warring States"" will affect directly or indirectly the whole of the world because of the smallness of the world and because these states will have populations of several hundred millions each. There will be a certain similarity to the European civil wars, ie WW I and WW II. If this happens then God help mankind'."
1,Good Attempt,"Firstly I would begin by saying: ""congratulations on getting your first book published!""The book title is very provocative and would compel any sinophile to read further. However, beyond the title, I found the book to be highly opinionated and inadequately substantiated."
1,Taiwanese speaks out against China.... how surprising...,"This book is a bunch of biased rubbish. Stay away!I have never before seen or read such an entirely one-sided piece of work. It should be added that most of the premises Mr Chang's arguments are based on have been disproven by time. This book is outdated and irrelevant.The author generalises every single ""bad"" event in recent Chinese history into a prediction for the future, and dismisses the obvious positives. I was surprised at first, but since finding out his father was in the inner ranks of the Taiwanese govt, this doesn't surprise me. It appears young Gordon was indoctrinated in his views early on.Not a paragraph in the book goes by without some generalisation about how ""...the ones without freedom will rise up..."" ""...the communist government will fail..."" etc. To the point where it becomes amusing.The best thing I can say is that I'm glad I took it out of the library and not bought it or received it as a present."
1,Highly entertaining book,"Ever since Gordon Chang started selling his book with fanfares, the events in the past 5 years have again and again disproven the bleak outlook Chang is trying to make money (and fame) on. Currently, Chang's bold prediction has become one of the most stupid prophecies in human history, and himself an entertaining laughingstock in the academic communities. Nowadays, even the most prominent China-haters in both academic and political circles have to distance themselves from Gordon in order not to be contaminated by the color of absurdity that Chang wears now. Looking back, we see how people with vision differ from those without."
1,Gordon Chang is just a total idiot,Why would any publishing house agree to publish such a stupid book??? This gordon chang's ridiculous predictions failed times and times again and he was still invited to speak???Are you all nuts???
1,Sensational claims of China's collapse just to build sales?,"As the tile of his book boldly declares, Mr Chang believes that China is about to collapse. Funny that *no one* else among the thousands of China scholars in many countries has come up with a similar conclusion! One should give credit to Mr Chang for flying in the face of the conventional wisdom. However, one has to wonder about Mr Chang's motivations for taking this contrarian view. Is this view based on some unusual insight into the workings of the Chinese state? For someone who claims to have spent 20 years in China, Mr Chang seems surprisingly uninformed about many basic aspects of contemporary Chinese realities. One has to conclude that Mr Chang's has crafted a novel and controversial thesis of China's imminent collapse not because it is supported by the facts but because he thinks this is the best way to generate sales for his first book!"
1,Infotainment; no insight to issue of the day,"a waste of time and money if your goal is to learn about China.if you want to learn something, better check out Kissinger's ""On China"" which offers a more sympathetic view to china or James Fallows ""China Airborne"" which is more critical of china. either book is a serious discussion, not entertainment ala Gordon Chang's."
1,Good Attempt,"Firstly, I would begin by saying : ""Congratulations on getting your first book published!"".The book title is very provocative and would compel any sinophile to read further. However, beyond the title, I found the book to be highly opinionated and inadequately substantiated."
1,At least he's not a warmonger,"This is not the book to read if you want a more objective book about China. At the very least, his message does not call for war on China. That being said, you'll have a pretty good understanding of what his writing is all about if you check out some of his articles that are published on the internet. He has a very ""relax, be happy, don't worry, don't be afraid"" message about China. The idea is that they'll self-destruct. This is a problem as it does not direct attention to the enormous fundamental challenges that America needs to deal with (much more than fearing a potentially dominant future China)."
3,Warning! There are no new cartoons in this book.,"If you love Zits, chances are you already own ""Zits"" and ""Growth Spurt."" If you do, you should no that ALL the strips in ""Humongus"" come from the first two collections. If you don't already have the first two, by all means get this one!"
2,TO THE ZITS FOLLOWER THIS BOOK WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This books contains NO NEW CARTOONS, and the Zits follower could feel cheated, but to NEW Zits FAN, it's a GREAT BUY, a two in one special. So, to the followers - if you have previous books don't purchase this book, unless your're buying it for a friend"
4,Zits is the best,"This is a fun Treasury - if you don't have the previous volumes. Except for some extra non-essential art work, there are no new panels. If you don't have the other volumes and want a book with a nice selection, good choice - otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,Great Comic Strip,"Humongous Zits is a compilation of the first two books of this comic strip. It starts out a little slow while the main characters are being introduced, but it soon catches its stride.Jeremy Duncan is a typical teenager just trying to live his life. His parents are on his back, he's got homework to avoid, his garage band isn't getting recording contracts, and he's awkward around the girl of his dreams. Needless to say, his life is anything but boring.The strip is written from Jeremy's point of view, which leads to some great sight gags as we see a situation through his eyes. The characters are slightly cartoonish but real enough for many years of great strips, and I look forward to enjoying it for years to come."
5,FINALLY I OWNED IT,"I HAD THIS IN BOOTLEGGED TAPE SINCE I WAS 13 AND I WAS NEVER ABLE TO FIND THE CD, IM A HUGE SASHA FAN I PAYED ALMOST $50.00 BUT TO ME IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. I LOVE IT !!!!"
3,Average climatology text book,"When I went to university, which was around when this book was published, text books like this one had great pictures and graphics in them. This one is graphically starved. Now 20 years later, I want to refresh my memory briefly with plenty of graphics, which this one doesn't have much of."
5,Loved it!!!!,This was a sweet and sexy read. Characters were interesting and believable. Nice twist on the typical high school reunion romance.
4,Scorching sex scenes,"I picked this book up to read on my vacation and it was perfect. Nice and light, with a building romance between a strong female lead and a sexy guy that you know is too good to be true (that's why we read, right?) The author is especially talented at creating sexual tension, and then writing the most scorching sex scenes while still keeping them tasteful. I'd actually like to read more books about this couple and their amazing chemistry. I'm knocking off a star for editing because there were too many errors that should have been easy to spot and correct (like spelling Blake's name wrong twice on the same page), but overall I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone that loves a steamy and satisfying romance."
3,Old high school acquaintances not forget.,"When a young woman attends her high school reunion she gets roped into helping the former school bad boy reach a troubled teen his is mentoring. That she used to have a crush on him complicates things slightly, especially now that she has finally caught his eye. The characters are well developed and the plot tight, but the female lead behaved a tad too selfishly for my tastes. I still recommend it though."
3,"A nice premise, but...","I tried to like this book, and I don't like to write negative reviews because I don't want people to write negative reviews of my stuff. I liked the heroine's job and thought the book would be more interesting because of that. I liked the idea of the hero being the town's bad boy.But...I didn't like the heroine and now that I've read the spoilers, I'm glad I didn't finish the book. The story was slow to get started...three chapters in and I was trying not to fall asleep. I didn't really care for the hero either, and the secondaries were kind of bland.I'm sorry...I think it could have been a great story if it weren't so slow moving."
4,Seeing 4 big stars out of 5,It's a really well-written and great story about coming out from under your hiding place - whether or not it's in a small town or from under the stars. Loved it.
4,opening scene is amazing,"The opening scene is amazing. I still remember it vividly, weeks after having read the book. I got this book for free on amazon, and it led me to reading a number of other Vanessa Grant books. She is a very skilled writer, and I recommend her books, other than the ones that are too ""old school"". This is not a usual ""old school romance"" happily - both the heroine and hero are likable and interesting."
2,Couldn't Get into It,"Claire is a downer, no life, no desire for a life and holes up with a telescope on top of a mountain and calls that her life. Upbeat friends wants to have fun at a class reunion, which is ridiculous because she was too shy and quiet to even know and speak to anybody during her time as a ""high school student"". Miraculously, the school bad boy seeks her out and raves about her eyes over and over? She defeated herself with negative talk the whole time... I felt sorry for former ""bad boy"" not to mention the youth he wanted her to counsel. I didn't care for the book and quit reading it."
1,Book bent,"I bought this book to use in this classroom, however, I was disappointed when I received it. It was sent in a plain envelope and was bent and put in my mailbox. The spine was broken and now the book won't stand on my shelves and is difficult to use. I am very disappointed."
3,too big for apartment,This is at least twice as big as a Pliko P3. It is nice but impossible to carry up stairs.
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","I rented it and am glad. It is not worth the buying price. It has a difficult to watch format and while the astute viewer may pick up some information, it is not much. The 3 trainers are good at what they do--HOWEVER--the entire concept of putting this much pressure on very young horses is a bad one. The trainers had to push the horses too fast and too far. This was not training but flooding, even when done with some feel and timing. Parelli makes himself look like an ass at the end, Cameron just pushed his colt too hard through out and Lyons is the best of the worst that day. All 3 know how to properly train a young horse and this venue was not it."
3,Great idea--too lengthy and poorly filmed,"Was so anxious to see this video...perhaps that's why it disapointed me. The shooting was very amateur (and low-budget) even as the premise is very exciting. Because three horsemen are on screen at once, and only one of them is highlighted into a bigger part of the screen at a time, it's hard to really see what's going on or to appreciate it. I don't regret buying it, but neither was it what I expected, thus the 3 stars."
4,training review,The video gave me the information I was seeking. It portrayed the training in an interesting fashion that did not become boring. It held my interest because it followed three trainers and not just one.
2,Don't bother.,"I thought some of our starting techniques here in Australia could do with a little refinement - but this DVD makes our station stockmen and the way they handle horses look like kindergarden teachers, which is just what they should be with horses of this age - equine Kindie teachers, not the slavemasters pictured in the DVD.Very nasty and only educational in the sense of it demonstrating what not to do with a young horse, as another reviewer has mentioned."
4,"Good, but not the needed definitive treatment","It is frustrating that we still don't have the definitive work on the Satanism scare of roughly 1980-1995. It's a big story. It was a gigantic urban legend, and a costly one. Careers were ruined. People went to jail. Large numbers of ""victims"" were left confused and traumatized. The press either fell asleep at the switch, or in the case of ABC's 20/20, Gerald Rivera and others, actively participated in the spread of this destructive panic.This book is accurate and courageous, published as it was when the scare was still very much alive, if in decline. Unfortunately, the timing of its publication and some weakness in writing and editing keep it from being the definitive text that remains needed. There's no mention of the Paul Ingram case and it predates the West Memphis 3 case which, of course, is ongoing.But, it's a fine introduction to the kind of psychological and sociological factors that lead to this kind of large scale panic."
2,Bad Sociological Explanations for Christian Hysteria,"It was good that the Satanic Cult hysteria of the 1980s was brought to light in book form but he fills this book with boring and in my opinion incorrect sociological explanations for the ""devil worshipper"" witchhunts of the 80s. He loves to point fingers ""white"", ""blue collar"", and ""uneducated"" types. In other words he's a typical academic ivory tower type that blames everything on working class white peoples intolerence and stupidity. He fails to mention, or doesn't realize that this whole pathology is caused by Christianity. Even if all the claims about underground Satanic cults murdering people and sexually abusing children were true it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the pedophilia that is rampant in all Christian churches. A young boy would be safer at a Nambla meeting than a Christian church."
1,Clueless,"If this guy isn't a satanist with an agenda, he is clueless. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Ignorance is not bliss."
5,Looks good,"I would start off by saying I've only tried it a few times here and there but from what I've used it, it does what it promises very well.Regardless of what you may see on the front box. This model(IR-9410C) does NOT come with a SATA input. It has an IDE interface only. It gets kind of hot really quickly but so far it hasn't seem to cause any problems. Comes with firewire cable, usb cable, and power supply. The device itself has two firewire ports and a usb port. Don't know why it has 2 firewire as you can only connect to one computer at a time.Transfer speed are decent and setup was fairly simple. The only thing I can't touch on is life span. Only had for a few months. Overall I'm satisfied."
1,Dont buy it!,This thing is a complete piece of junk. It falls apart when you touch it total waste of money.
3,Extensive math and science and vocab.reviews,"There were two reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars. First off I took the NET test, this book seems to be geared more towards the more extensive ACT type tests. The NET mostly focuses on fractions, decimals and precents. This book went from theses basic math problems to trig. so it was a bit overkill for the net test. The other reason I didnt give it 5 stars...there were about a half a dozen mistakes in the book but they are obvious and wont lead you astray."
4,Late 60s early 70s gem,"When I first heard this there were not that many female rockers, basically Grace & Janis. But this was different, defiant, yet gentle. Stong and nurturing. It was joyous and it cooked. Great to see it out on CD."
4,"A brisk, light tale with a nice turn of phrase.","The Kirkus Review is right on. Very readable. Not deep. The author has a way of describing interesting siuations. The story develops well and then wraps up a little too neatly. Still, I liked it."
4,extremely erotic.,"I find this movie extremely interestisting becauce it shows us an amazing part of the human suxuality that in this ocation deals with a woman been unabl to control herself from becoming deeply aroused when a savage man rapes her in repeated occations. the story is told intelligently and has really amazing scenes, it is really a spectacle to see this film, i just want to recomend it to anybody with a supercurious mind who is looking for exeptionally beautiful sensuos work!!!! it is truly a wrk of art , a masterpiece."
2,"So so for safety, definite NO for sight!","When placed at an angle that is downcast enough for it to be fairly bright, it's at such close range that it's useless if you actually need a light to see where you're going."
4,"Not Bette's best, but...","Always loved the movie, but Bette's contention that it was her best effort and not her best performance says it all. With Ernie Borgnine coming off a Best Actor award for Marty, it probably wasn't necessary to beef up the cast with Davis instead of someone like Thelma Ritter who would have been perfect. Watching Davis try to be poor and to simulate a Bronx demeanor is painful, but Ernie saves it. You get the feeling that Davis took the part as a personal challenge and a paycheck when her heyday was long gone."
2,Stars Can't Rescue Dreary Material,"Dreary settings, dreary story, dreary moralistic ending. Bette Davis attempts a lower-class New York Irish accent, with little success, and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Ernest Borgnine, doing a rehash of his Marty role with a bitter edge. Debbie Reynolds in a non-comic role is surprisingly good, but also unconvincing as the poor daughter of a cab driver. Barry Fitzgerald provides a much-needed spark of life, and, of course, is the only one with a convincing characterization. The story wraps up conveniently with the central characters having sudden, inexplicable changes of heart. Definitely a disappointment."
3,Definitely a specialty item,"For the guy who wants to verify a Parker he's thinking of buying from the neighborhood gunshop, this is probably not the right book for him. For the shop that gets a few vintage Parkers through the door every year, it's a great reference. Please bear in mind, its not a complete list of every gun made. A friend of mine just got a 28 ga VH and the number is not listed, but for the majority of the guns made by them, you can find the basics of how it left the factory, along with a nice index on frame sizes and how to decipher the markings. Great reference for the limited market it will appeal to."
1,Part Selector doesn't work,Ordered a pretty expensive heater control nob. I used the parts selector car specific. It was not the right part. Very frustrating.
5,Excellent resource,This is an excellent resource to have. I carry it and Pocket Guide to Musculoskeletal Diagnosis around with me. I also use Hoppenfeld for physical exam. And I think that Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care is a good reference book as well. The Orthopedic Intern Pocket Survival Guide is also good for medical students.
2,not good,"this book is not good, print quality is poor,paper is rough, word is too small, and the line is not straight.content is not good too, no index for Abbreviations.i do not think is a good reference book for intern."
1,so confused,"I was so upset when I recieved the book in the mail.Unless the book is wrong,beanie babies are going out of style.The bears prices have dropped anywhere between 10$ and 60$.It starting to scare me,I'm wondering if I made a bad investment!?"
1,Bad Business,"When We ordered the book, It was suppose to ship within 3-5 business days, however after 4-months we still did not recieve it, everytime We called They would say ""give it another week"" So We were forced to get a refund, and that took another Month to recieve!! The least they could have done was just tell us they didn't have the book to sell, In 5-Months they never called us once, if we didn't call them, We would still be waiting with no response, altho they had our money from day one!"
1,Where is my book?,I ordered this on Oct. 3 and have gotten many excuses as to why it hasn't been delivered.
3,Interesting,This was an interesting book. If you like this book try another one I found called Maximize Your Inheritance by Jarratt Bennett. Worth it.
4,"Works as advertised, but the whole system has a few kinks","Guess thats why they are discontinuing the product. Its a shame because it works well, just has a few issues to resolve."
5,Declan is INCORRECT,"""Reviewer"" Declan Hayes might wish to regroup, and, start over. I've been heavyhander since book#1. The heavyhands equipment isn't intended to be ""pretty"", it is VASTLY more efficient by obviating ""gripping"" throughout cycle. Proof is in the pudding. Since heavyhands, I'm JUST as ripped as previous Cybex gym visits: total daily time investment is 30 minutes. Now, THAT's efficent. AS with ANY exercise , DOING it counts; correct FORM doesn't hurt."
3,ok...,I was hoping for something better. It is the same as old one. Which only lasted 6 years. oh well...
3,Veranda square smoker cover,It is a well made item and looks good but would have been better if it had been a few inches longer. Had to cover rest of smoker with clear plastic sheeting. Ship time was excellent.
2,"Good cover, but the dimensions were wrong","I had to return this. The quality is there, it just wasn't nearly as long as advertised. It was about 10"" shorter than my smoker."
4,Nice cover,Nice cover. You can imagine our disappointment when we discovered it was too small for our smoker. Sent it back & reevaluating our options.
1,Well made cover but!!!!,"This cover is for ROUND smokers only. My SQUARE smoker is 16x18x36 so according to the item description it should've fit, (wrong). The word that was left out of the description was DIAMETER. Instead of 20x20 it should read 20 in.dia. Other than that it is a well made cover and well worth the money."
4,Snug fit on Masterbuilt M7P,"Fits exactly as pictured, SNUG, tight fit, no extra ""wiggle"" room on Masterbuilt M7P smoker. My only concern is UV will cause the cover to shrink rendering it useless. It's hard to say how long the Gardelle fabric system will last even in the shade under a covered deck. I don't especially care for the color either and wish for black. Weber has one in black vinyl but its twice the size - width x length. Lastly, if I remember, I will update this thread in Sept-Oct 2010."
5,Veranda square smoker cover,This is an extremely well made product. I have only had it a short while but I am impressed with the quality. My Masterbuilt smoker feels warm and comfy with it on.
5,very unusual,"Bought teh book on the basis of the cover, and it turned out to be really good. STrange unusual subject matter with a good fantasy plot that pulled all the strings together at the end, but promised much more to come. I am now very interested to see how the next book inthe series turns out. The author is very good at dialog and descriptions. Highly reccommended."
2,BORING!,"THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH IT!! I COULDN'T TOLERATE READING ""I'M YOUR WOMAN, I KNOW IT"" ONE MORE TIME! MAYBE IF I WOULD HAVE STUCK IT OUT THE STORY LINE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BETTER. THE COVER ON THE BOOK WAS DECEIVING BECAUSE I PICTURED LORNA AS A SHORT LITTLE TWIT WHO PROBABLY WASN'T HALF AS PRETTY AS THE WOMAN ON THE COVER. SO FAR THE ONLY DOROTHY GARLOCK BOOK I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO PUT DOWN WAS MIDNIGHT BLUE. CHECK IT OUT FOR A BETTER READ."
5,A Place in Twentieth Century Literature Rests Here,"This is a difficult, provocative, awesomely beautiful book -- easily one of the great novels of the twentieth century. I can only think of a handful of other books I've ever read that are as brilliantly and thrillingly written: Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner; Robert Penn Warren's All the Kings Men, and Faulkner's Sound and the Fury come to mind. It is the story of a man looking for his place in the universe, a member of a dying tribe trying to keeps its legends alive. It is the story of an artist, the story of someone merely trying to live and make sense of what living means. It is the story of every person, every culture, every tribe. I loved it."
4,Wyclef Jean - Champion of Music and Art Education,I always enjoy a concert that includes Eric Clapton. This concert gave me a new view of Wyclef Jean and and appreciation for his dedication to young people. His band/orchestra was composed of young people who were both talented and professional. The all-star guests provided something for everyone. This is a concert to enoy again and again.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is not what I expected. Many of the cakes are ice cream cakes, which I wasn't interested in and I wasn't forewarned about. I was looking for a book that would give me easy to follow instructions, on easy to make cakes, in cute themes. There are maybe 3 cakes I would consider using and they won't be easy. So overall this book was a big waste of money. I think I'll be better off using my own creativity."
2,Weak,"This is undoubtedly an ambitious book, covering some of the most complicated (and neglected) topics in the world of Linux programming. Unfortunately, it suffers from some critical defects.The first two chapters are the obligatory redundant recycling of UNIX fundamentals that is the hallmark of lazy authors. Face it: if you don't know what emacs or a shell is, you shouldn't be reading this book; if this is the best opening you can come up with, you shouldn't be writing it either.While the range of subjects is broad, the authors fail to cover them in sufficient depth. For example, sockets receive a scant five pages and the examples only treat UNIX domain sockets. Who cares about UNIX domain sockets? Why are there no examples of multi-threaded Internet domain socket servers?To be fair, the coverage of the Linux-specific material is decent, but doesn't justify the price tag. Bottom line: this is a good introduction to the subject of threads and Linux technicals, but will leave you needing more. .."
3,Not good for beginning but it's not an advanced book,"I don't think this is considered as an advanced linux since it doesn't cover anything new, in depth, new techniques or tricks . I bought the beginning linux programming and it's much better in covering many topics with excellent examples. Check out yourself.T.T"
1,Advanced programming or Advanced HYPE?,"Retitle this book Basic Linux Programming, Fundamentals of Linux Programming, or how about Introduction to Linux Programming ... unless that is what your looking for DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Its clear that this book is more of a means to promote the authors business than to inform."
3,I think it was an interesting book about scientist,"This book was very interlectial and extreamly facinating. I throughly enjoyed readin this book about a scientist that gets lost in the city. My mum,dad,brothers,uncles,aunts also liked this book because I lent it to them all."
2,Dictionary of Traditional Medicine,"This book's title does not match its contents. I was disappointed of the contents. I thought it is a dictionary where I could look for different Chinese herbal meaning and espcially the ""pin yin"" what actually means in English or even got pictures to make it comprehend for readers. I hope someone could introduce me a Chinese Medicine booklet which explains what the ""pin yin"" is, and with pictures to show what it is good for or healing for."
4,Creating a genius!,My opinion of the Baby Genius products is so much higher than other educational DVD's. My son loves them all! IT's amazing what he retains from the stories! It's quite wonderful!
3,For Baby Genius Fans,"This DVD set was nice, but nothing fantastic. We ordered it because our son was watching the free Baby Genius shorts on our cable ""on demand"" over and over. I got this to take w/ us on a car trip. It worked out pretty well. 1 of the DVDs is the exact same videos that are shown on the free ""on demand"" channel from our cable provider. Those are his favorite. The other 2 DVDs are of a zoo and something else. I don't know b/c he won't watch those ones. We could have just purchased the 1 on its own and been fine. He enjoys the kids singing and dancing to the nursery rhyme songs. The graphics and production level are very minimal/basic, but for kids, that is ok. He loves it. A good DVD set for young kids, does offer some educational value."
2,Missing Rhymes,"I bought this for the nursery rhyme DVD because my 20 month old loves to listen to Mother Goose rhymes and we thought he would enjoy the DVD in the car. If B-I-N-G-O, She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain, and Vinko the Dancing Bear are what you're looking for, this DVD is for you. If you want classic Mother Goose...choose something else. The bonus music CD does include Itsy Bitsy Spider, Pat-A-Cake and others. I wish the creators had put those rhymes on the DVD. The other 2 DVDs are okay but don't include narration that helps explain what your child is looking at. I'm not sure why this won awards."
2,Baby Genius 3 Pack - Volume 1,"My granddaughter only liked the Favorite Nursery Rhymes disc. I wish I had known that the other two DVDs were totally different from the Favorite Nursery Rhymes DVD. The other two don't involve the Baby Genius characters as much, and the songs aren't very catchy and are too slow. Does not keep my granddaughter's attention at all."
3,dispid says:,"apparat is like a blend of M83, Underworld, and FC/Kahuna all wrapped up into a nice neat little package.let me suggest you start with ""Headup"". really good track."
4,Good Stuff,Just discovered this band today via MySpace. Came to Amazon to hear more track clips and they are unavailable. Thats too bad. I dont buy whole CD's anymore would have loved to get one song and review the rest.
1,"This book is a scam, pure and simple.","Anyone with any brains could tell that this book is merely a ploy to get children on the lists of direct mail marketers at an early age. PLEASE do not buy this book and perprtuate this scam further. Yes, your children will like getting little trinkets in the mail, but in one week they will be forgotten about (maybe sooner) and just junk up everything. Is a minute of cheerfulness worth a lifetime of mailboxes worth of junk mail? I think not."
4,"Anastasia, Please","From a plot standpoint, we've seen this one before -- it's reminiscent ofDangerous LiaisonsandDangerous Beauty. The story line is framed by a chorus of mediocrity. What sparks and differentiates this film is Argento's performance. She is purely and unapolegetically carnal. She is comparable to a mix of Frida Khalo's masculinity and Cleopatra's seductress. I'm not sure how much of this character is acted, but it is quintessentially Asia Argento."
3,costumes & scenery nice,"The movie is too long and the acting is flat. But the scenery and the costumes are beautiful. Really, though the nude and sex scenes are gratuitous. I am glad I didn't have to pay anything for this one."
4,A beautiful french period movie,"I loved this movie mostly for the fantastic design work and recreation of the period. This is not a cheerful movie so if you are looking for something uplifting, this is not it. I loved watching this movie though as the storytelling was superb and it was truly captivating in its beauty."
3,disappointed..,"The Last Mistress was compared too Dangerous Liasons. While, I was impressed with the historical caption, I found the storyline to elementary. It was not,the beast like obsession that obligated them to each other, it was history like any relationship that made it so. To many questions, they both never married because of money and freedom. The virgin wife was wealthy from the start and had no need, except to be loved. Was, the marriage a lesson taught? Without history...there is no deeper love....without love there is no real physical intimacy. I would have been advantageous to elaborate a little more on ""the masterpiece""."
2,disappointed and depressed,"I truly disliked this movie. A fan of costume dramas, I love les liasons dangereuses, but I couldn't empathize with these characters. Ryno and Vermilli seemed stuck in a miserable struggle of pushing their lives up the hill only to watch them fall down again, or at least Ryno seemed to be trying to progress. Vermilli was too caught up in her own drama to have any care for Ryno's wife. She seemed intent on making everyone around her as miserable as she was. Not an attractive woman! Also, how could the grandmother love her granddaughter as much as said and sit mildly listening to this man talk of his betrayal? Even for 19th century France this seems implausible. I'm giving it two stars only because the costumes and the language used in the film were so beautiful."
2,???? for the ending,"I liked the movie in the beginning but the ending threw me off. I was like, what the heck happened?"
3,"It is boring, and not a masterpiece","A costume drama free of many of the director's trademark excesses, this is a study of how sexual obsession can overpower true love. Perhaps it's the lack of sex or perhaps it's the incessant, banal chattering of the characters, but this movie is more likely to inspire sleep than interest. Breillat has done something I never expected from her: made a boring film. I prefer ""A Man and A Woman""."
3,highly enjoyable and great acting from Asia Argento,"With superb acting from Asia Argento, The Last Mistress enchants and repels at the same time. It's a worn tale of love and destruction that so devastating that it will be a downer for the rest of the day or week that you watch it."
1,in 1835 everybody was rich in France,"Yes, I have to repeat--in 1835 everybody was rich in France--or this is what movie trying to show. As obviously this will be propaganda lets try to compare this flick to less known from/for same period--Black Venus.In Black Venus men and women have to strugle to survive and women practice oldest profession which is understandable. In short Black Venus is realistic and Last Mistress is a fantasy.Asia Argento never been really sexy anyway looks like drug addict at the least. As usual in this type of nonsense sex looks like a fantasy for kids and we never see something to remember unlike Black Venus where women are what men wanna see.Why should I care about rich people's life--there is no connection. Waste of money."
1,this book is wonderful but this copy was damaged,The book was misrepresented in the description. Pages were falling out. The whole thing needed serious repair. The book itself is a wonderful thing though. Thank you Amazon for reimbursing my payment.
5,My first Ruth Krauss/Maurice Sendak book,I love this book! It's my first one by Ruth Krauss/Maurice Sendak. I've read it 3 times already. I love the text and the illustrations; I could look at them over and over. I wish I could eat the book. haha It makes me happy. I'm 34 by the way. I want to get her other books. I love the way she thinks and I love Sendak's illustrations.
2,great learning material,"As I watched this, I kept thinking, ""Wow, making movies is hard."" Probably because these guys kept getting it wrong: lighting, scenes falling flat, actors missing the beat, missing the boat, little distractions, sound, etc. But they did manage to get Mena Suvari so it wasn't all bad."
2,A very average action movie with very average acting. Tom Arnold and Mena Suvari are best actors in movie..so yeah...I say C-,"""I liked him, I just can't believe he killed those people."" After an insurance investigator is killed and blamed for a string of murders a writer comes into town to write a book on the events. Talking to his girlfriend and his new neighbor he begins to uncover secrets that may lead to his innocence. This movie seems better then it is. The acting is passible...but with Tom Arnold giving the best performance that should help you with the quality involved. Besides the performances the editing was very strange and seemed very choppy. But all that aside this movie was very ordinary and kinda boring. For an action movie this was not full of action and was rough to get through. All that being said I have seen worse. Overall, worth watching only if you love action movies more then any other genre. I give it a C-.*Also try - Blood Out"
5,Restitution,Who what a movie and all the Action I can handle so if you like me like Acton movies this is the on to see 4 times I did.Erick
2,Surely You Jest . . .,"I had to stop halfway through this movie and go check it on the internet. It was impossible to figure out what the director was trying to do with it. The evolution of my reaction went thus:(1) Yow. How did this sophomoric stuff get to the screen?(2) Hmmm . . . maybe it's supposed to be funny. Tongue-in-cheek?(3) Twin Peaks?(4) No . . . just really, really bad.(5) Maybe I'm just missing something here in the art venue?(6) Wow. This is SO bad, it's almost good.I'm going to guess that, from the DVD jacket design on down through the actual film, the director was trying to do this on purpose. Maybe eventually . . . a cult classic in its awfulness?"
1,1 star only because there isn't a way to rate it as a negative 5.,"The lead actor was so out of shape and such a really!really! bad actor that we had a great time laughing at just how bad it was, like we were being punked! The girl who is suppose to be in love with him doesn't recognize him when he comes back after a year (she thinks he is dead) even though as soon as he opens his mouth he sounds the same. All he did was shave.OMG & LOL Watch it till the end when he takes off his shirt with man boobs and beer belly...oh and the music score has to be stolen from a lifetime channel movie, it is that sad. Poor Tom Arnold at least he appears to know he's in a comedy. The worst movie but a good laugh because it is so bad. Watch it only if it's free!!!!!"
2,NOT MUSIC,Beware this is not a music CD!! It is not Daughtry's second album. We did get a refund when we immediately returned it.
5,Wonderful voice and great musicians!,Madeleine Peyroux is the closest singer to a reincarnation of Lady Day that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Her voice and phrasing are sumptuous. Choice of material is interesting. Musicians are excellent.
2,Doesn't quite do it for me,"Sorry folks, but this suposedly silky vocalist doesn't quite do it for me. It all sounds like another nice package with no real substance. It's artificial, and a long way from really good singers past and present.I promise I've tried!"
4,Nice Sounds,This is a nice collection of songs done very well by good musicians and a lady with a lovely singing voice.
5,"More, please!","I, too, came to this site hoping for the newest release. I've had Dreamland for many years, and am always checking to see if Ms. Peyroux has done anything else. Her sultry, sexy and fun presentation of new and old songs is unique. I really love her music, and would recommend her to anyone who likes the Patsy Cline-Billie Holiday--type style."
3,A good staring point for officer candidates,"This is a good way to begin preparing for your qualifying test, but the questions seem to be much easier than those posed on the actual test. A helpful way to get used to the format of the test and also the type of questions asked, but it needs to be updated!!!! The section on possible career choices was useful for those who do not know what career field they would suit. Not bad."
3,Book is good but the last edition was made in 1993!!!,"The book is good! but there has to be a more recent edition made since the last one was made in 1993, and in some instances doesn't concide with the more recent examination questions."
2,Book is poorly written with a lot of errors,"I am very disappointed with this book because there are a lot of errors in it. I found the newer edition, and was disappointed to see the same typos in it. This was particularly upsetting because the typos that I noticed are in the Math sections (although I am sure they are elsewhere too) It is unfortunate there are few resources to choose from for this topic. The explanations in the math section are also poorly written. I am honestly worried about the real exam because this book gives me very little guidance."
3,this book isn't worth itReviewer:,"Read Thomas Hochmann review of the book and that is about what i feel. The circit board part of the test isn't in the test any more. I took the AFOQT on March 10, 2006. The test has changed look at my other reviews to see how it has changed.This sample questions are harder than the actual test. The math is definitly harder and some of the words are too. If you have time to find this book in a book store and have a few hours to just brows it do that to save your money.But if you really need to buy a book to review the test buy this one and you will be very prepared for the non-technical part of the test."
3,"If you did well on the SAT's, then don't buy this book!","Some test preparation books are great. They provide you with ample practice problems, but most importantly they provide you with critical test taking strategies. This book provides plenty of practice problems, but you don't need to buy a book for that! Just use your old high school text books! All the test basically compramises of is math and english and if you did well on the SAT, then you know you're already proficient in those areas. All you need is touch up work and this book won't help with that. The reason I bought this book was to learn the strategies behind the test. Unfortunately, this book contains very little of that. In my opinion, the sample test prep book that your service should provide for free is good enough."
2,Not what I expected,"When I got this book, I thought that I would help me prepare for the AFOQT as best as possible. Thank goodness I thought about getting the SAT book as well. The only things this book showed was the type of questions that you may have on the test, along with the answers. For the math portion, it did not show the steps that lead to the answer, just the answer itself. I recommend that you study the SAT book in preparation for the test. It explained why the answer was the correct one, and it even gave you formulas that you may have forgotten (for those of you who have been out of school for a while, like myself). It also stated hints as to how to take the test. The Officer Candidate Test book did none of this. The SAT book was a big help. The OCT book was a waste of money!"
4,Good Book.,"For most people attempting to get into OCS, OCC, or the like this book will be valuable to you. However, I will give you this much this book is great for the standard officer testing in that it covers what is basically the officer equivalent of the ASVAB. However, if you are applying to the Air Force or if you are interested in being a pilot buy Arco's Military Flight Aptitude Test book. Officer tests like the AFOQT are desgined to check for pilot and navigator candidacy so it is recommended that if you are looking into a job like that or are applying to a branch like that then I recommend that book. However if you are joing the Army, Marines, or Navy and instead are interested in other fields this book will give you the chance you need to succeed."
3,Lots of sample questions,Book is good for reviewing what you might need to brush up on. Don't base your future on this book alone.
3,Good info but...,"Basically in a nut shell this book has pretty good info but it's somewhat out dated. The other books (especially Barron's which is the other one I have) is a lot more up to date. For example, this book still says the OTS is in Texas when it is in fact in Alabama nowadays."
3,Not really applicable to a lot of jobs.,"Many jobs in the military for officers require specific tests instead of the general officer exams. For Navy, for instance, you'll often just take the aviation exam. The exception is for general duty officers."
1,Infuriating,"A screw has 8 threads per inch and a vise must travel 2 inches along it. How many revolutions must the handle make? 16, right? The book says 18, with no explanation of the mysterious missing threads. Do you have to spin a couple of times to get going?In short, the explanations stink (the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps) and there is not enough background material or pointers to references.The entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available Navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the Navy used.There is no online companion to this - not even an errata so the authors could point out some of their mistakes.I take this exam next week and I'm scared."
2,A study guide that needs some work.,"I bought both this book and Military Flight Aptitude Tests to prepare for my Naval Officer Specimen Battery. I think that this book is nowhere near as helpful as the other. Even if you don't want to be a pilot, the other guide is much more comprehensive."
1,No te prepara suficiente para el test,I bought this book because I thought its prepare me for the test the reality is other. The book was not good. I took the ASTB test for Navy officer and the test is completly difference.
2,Save your Money and Time,"I studied this book inside out, and learned the hard way that it was worthless. Try the SAT or GMAT for real help."
3,Poor review for the test,"This book will give you a very very general review of what you need to know. However, there are sections on the actual test which are not in the book like. The math problems don't look much like ones on the test either. However, there are no one books out there which are for officer candidates. Good luck everyone, I know that I need it."
5,good,Nice and lightweight for summer time especially when you want to keep your head from burning in the sun and it is just too warm for a hat.
2,Disappointing,"I have ordered many items from ZAN in the past and have been satisfied with their products, however this item is not up to their usual standards. The product is poorly made and really not worthy of the ZANheadgear name. I was them by hand, and the stitching still unravels."
1,Adapter does not provide enough charging current,"Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with. definitely do not buy"
1,EH.,"So, I get it in the mail REALLY quickly and I was so happy that it was the right size and everything! Then it breaks. After only a week of use. The little silver part gets stuck in my phone and I can't fix the charger. Sadly, I paid cheap for something cheap."
4,Advanced Calc 2,"I highly recommend this DVD for anyone taking a calculus course or is interested in getting a better grip on previous Calculus courses. A good background in other math courses is needed to fully understand the material in the DVDs. Steps are often skipped to save time and fit in extra problems. Overall, this DVD series has helped me tremendously with Calc 1 and 2 at the college level."
4,Not to mention the dog!,"I discovered this book at a book sale, read it a few days later, and I want more. This is not some epic doorstop of a fantasy novel. It's short and doesn't ramble on. And while there's some wandering in the wildness for the characters, it's not boring, and EF stays on course. The setting is somewhat Arabian Nights-esque, but this is not some copy of the Arab world during the Middle Ages with some genies thrown in. Yes, there are some Djinn, but not in an annoying way. My only complaint is it ends a little too abruptly (although there's a nice denouement).Now, there are three sequels to Mustapha and His Wise Dog (the dog is the best character!Completely unexpected.), and supposedly, they do not have to be read in order. However, rumor has it that there were supposed to be 12 books, but they never came to fruition. EF, if you're reading this, please write/publish them all, even if it's as an indie author doing ebooks."
3,Handle not included,"The product arrived in the time frame they estimated and the price was good; Even with the somewhat higher than expected shipping cost, the whole purchase was priced better than other vendors. However, it did not include a handle like the picture featured, and as was described in the other review. They should change the picture."
3,"Amusing, if not one of the better early books","Herge, The Broken Ear (Methuen, 1937)The Broken Ear is, to be blunt, not one of Herge's better early efforts; the episodic nature of the adventure, which is always at odds with the larger structure of the story, often gets the upper hand here, and the minor characters are somewhat less complex than they are in most of the later volumes-- a flaw that's common to the early works, but seems more prominent here for some reason. This is another one that those new to the series will want to pass up for later work before reading. ***"
4,A good Tintin book.,"Herge does it again with another fine Tintin story. If you like Tintin as much as my kids and I do, you'll enjoy the Broken Ear."
1,All 5 cats hated this,"With things like this, it's always a case of ""your mileage may vary"". In our case, the car broke down in the driveway. We have five kitties, four of which are piggy creatures who love treats. Not a single one was remotely interested in this oil. And it's not necessarily an oil thing - several of them like(d) ferretone and often had a bit, when we still had ferrets. I can't speak to anything about this product because I had no guinea pigs. They all refused it, and I was forced to admit defeat and recycle the bottle."
5,The second bottle,"This being the second bottle of salmon oil I thought i would add - Bottle was used daily at 1/2 the recommended for my 100lb Dane/lab and my 65lb pit bull and our cats got a teaspoon or so intermittently and the bottle lasted about 2 months. The coats of all the animals has improved dramatically. Also no dander on my Dane which is amazing!! Shedding has been reduced by at least 75%. There hasn't been a hairball 1 from the cats and stopped using ""grease"" in a tube on them.(this alone makes this product heaven sent!!)I am ordering more and will continue to use this product - well worth the money."
5,My dogs coat has never been softer!,"I bought this product for the health benefits it would have on my dogs heart and immune system. And obviously I can't speak for how the product is doing in that regard - but what I can say is that my dog's coat has never been softer!! She's only been on this supplement for about a month now and I can definitely tell it's doing something by how soft she is. So I can only imagine, and hope - it's have the same positive effects to her inside as it has to her outside!"
5,Love Grizzly Salmon Oil,"Last fall, we discovered, after doing x-rays, that our 6 year old dog Dooper has abnormal hips. He used to come up limping after agility and Frisbee catching so that's why we did the x-rays. A canine nutrition specialist recommended using this product to help protect and ease his pain and lubricate his hips. It works! Using it daily, adding to his food, he loves the taste and we see great results. We haven't seen him limp or act ""stiff"" in quite a while, fortunately. Helps make his coat look glossy too.Love the pump feature though it does drip a little when we put it up in the fridge so we put a paper towel under it.P.S. We were told too that he should have Vitamin E supplement so that his body properly absorbs the Salmon Oil."
4,Bought it for itching,"My dog was itching like crazy so we checked for fleas, nada. We gave her this to supplement her meal, nada. We changed her dog food to isolate any allergy if any and sure enough our food cost doubled but no more itching so I doubt this oil alone solved our problem. To be fair we still give her this because she loves it (ate her old and now new food in less than 2 minutes every time) and it's meant to be a good supplement so we just bought it again when the old bottle ran out. Our dog is a border Collie mix."
3,Grizzly Salmon Oil - Good or a waste of money?,"It's hard to tell if my dog has benefited much from the oil. She's been on it for about a year, 2x daily. Then again, she's about 11 years old and her coat is beginning to change, less shinny and vibrant. I continue with the oil because I think it's beneficial to have it in her system. It's sort of like the yoga I practice...it's designed to ""maximize potential and minimize liability."" My hope is that the oil does just that."
1,Product is usually good.. but not this time.,"I've purchased this salmon oil through Amazon before without problem, but this was a (VERY) bad batch that has cost me a lot of money in vet bills."
1,Right back at you!,"I just bought a bottle of this. Next morning I put 1 squirt on Roxy's food. She ate it up, no problem. 10 minutes later, entire breakfast came back up - smelling really, really bad. She has never thrown up before. Into the trash can went the fish oil... based on other reviews this works well, but not with my young Standard Poodle!"
1,Not what I expected,"I have heard quite a bit of good reviews on this product, so I decided to order it for my two Yorkies. Are using this product for a while, I noticed that their coats were not NEAR as shiney as they were when I was using Missing Link, which is what I untimately decided to switch back to. I will be sticking with that. It works wonders on their coats and makes them so shiney!I think my dog liked the taste of the Grizzly Salmon Oil, but their coats really started to look dull and lose it's shine - so I went back to what works best - Missing Link!"
1,Arrived with an expired use by date,Do not purchase.This product arrived with an expired use by date.Hate going through the trouble of ordering something online and then having to return it because of a problem that never should have been
4,Our vet suggested we try salmon oil for our greyhoun,Our vet recommended we add salmon oil to our dog's food each day to help with her joints. She is a 12 year old retired racer greyhound and we are worried about the occasional stiffness she has in her hips and legs. The product arrived in good condition and the pump works fine. The main change we noticed in our dog is that her coat is very soft and shiny. She also seems to still be moving well for an old girl. Our dog likes the taste of it and it is not too stinky when you use it.
2,"Well, I Hate to Disagree, But...","I hate to disagree with the majority of reviewers and I should mention that I give my dog fish oil every day (other brands), but there is something about this brand, which we recently tried. It gives her diarrhea, seems to upset her stomach and she doesn't like it. It also seems to trigger an allergic response, causing her to itch and scratch. I thought maybe there was something wrong with this bottle of product, so I even tried another bottle, purchased elsewhere, with the same result. And I tried using a smaller dose. Quite perplexed, as my dog does fine with other brands, but not this one. Guess we will stick with the other brands."
5,Dogs Love It,"We have one dog we are fostering that had patches of fur missing, was very thin and had extremely flaky skin. We have been using this product as a snack for him. He's healthy, all of his fur is back and he loves this as a treat."
4,Great product; but poor quality control for package,"I have been using this product for over 6 years and it has been great. My black lab's hair has a nice shine to it and she never has had any skin problems. I highly recommend the salmon oil. Unfortunately, as others have posted the bottle top was not completely closed so the oil leaked on other items ordered and through the cardboard box it was shipped in. Unsure if this is an Amazon issue or an issue of the manufacturer of the salmon oil."
4,"Great Product, but please take more care when shipping.","This oil is great! My dogs love it. All three have it on their breakfast every morning. Their coats are soft and shiny, and they think they are getting a fantastic treat every day. Four out of five stars because I had a small issue with the way this was shipped. I imagine things get pretty jostled during transport, and the cap was a bit loosened and oil leaked all over the inside of the box. Not only was it messy, it was a waste of product. Please take more precautions when packing messy liquids like this. Other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4,"Good product, fishy smell","This is a solid product and will help your dog's coat be sleek and shiny. The only bad part is that it has a very fishy smell. Not a problem if your dog eats the food right away, but can be a bit much if the food sits around for hours."
2,I didn't notice a difference at all.,I bought this to help my dogs' dry skin but I didn't notice a bit of difference. The only good thing is that it doesn't smell like fish too badly and it helped my dogs want to eat their dry food. But I don't think I'd buy it again.
1,Dog sick....,"I hate to leave a bad review on this, but my dog has been ill for 3 days now, starting just an hour after his one and only dose of this. Diarrhea, then constipation and now vomiting and lethargy. We're taking him to the vet today. The nozzle was broken when we rec'd it, so maybe it spoiled??"
1,motor oil?,"No way this could be fish oil. I tried it some dry food that my cats eat they sniffed and walked away. I dont know how I missed all the negative reviews. It is clear this is a USELESS product. I guess I figured hey its oil. What could possibly go wrong, and purchased the big bottle. BIG MISTAKE!!. Now I have a 32oz bottle of $20 lubricant for my garage door. DUH!! sorry kitties, I could have got you a case of your fav salmon and rice cans. I feel like a complete schmuck!! DO NOT BUY!!"
3,Grizzly salmon oil,"The pump cover would not untwist so I've had to take the main cover off each time I use and measure out with a spoon.Otherwise, the oil is very good and I''ve used it previously."
5,Salmon Oil for Dogs,Wonderful supplement for my dog's dry itchy skin. Saw results in just over a week of use. The price was the best I found on the internet.
5,Omega-3 Salmon Oil,"My dogs absolutely love this product. I have two German Shepards and a Jack Russel mix and all three of them seem to have a nicer coat, less shedding and my female GSD has shown noticable improvment in her hips/joint pain."
4,Sticky and stinky but necessary.,"Both our dog and our cat eat this with their food to improve their coat/fur health and it really does work. We learned our lesson about keeping it in a secure storage place, though, because it is quite sticky if any leaks...and stinky! The things we do for our fur babies...."
5,Great stuff!,"I primarily use this in conjunction with Vetri Science's Renal Support for dogs to treat my 12 year old female Cocker Spaniel's kidney disease. They work well together and she's been doing fine on this combination. But along the way her coat's gotten pretty lush too, a very nice effect I'd attribute to the oil, it also helps her dry patches she has from a fungal skin condition. Plus it's quite economical to use too, just one pump does it. It's not her fave thing though, she tends to hide from me when it's time to take it, but she'll suffer it well. Thanks to all the great reviews here, I happened on a great product. Highly recommend!"
4,My dogs love it...,"I haven't noticed any change in my dogs shedding but my Ridgeback mix's coat is definately more shiny. She was itching a little and that has stopped since using this product a few weeks. My long-hair chihuahua mix is still shedding like crazy but her itching, which was pretty bad, has reduced substantially. Plus, they love the taste. My chihuahua is a picky eater but she will sometimes eat her whole bowl of food in one sitting now. The ridgeback goes nuts and dances on her hind legs when her bowl is being prepared. Overall I will continue using this product because it's helped stop the itching and the dogs love it. Can't say it's the answer to the shedding problem though."
2,Did not help my itchy dog,I have a 90 lb American Bulldog. She has been itching and scratching for months. I tried this oil and it did absolutely nothing to help her at all. Don't waste your money!
3,Grizzly Salmon Oil,Hard to judge my dogs opinion of this. He doesn't get any people food except leftover vegies. He always gives me a funny look when he's done with his morning salmon oil. Maybe he's thanking me. He eats his food that I put it on so I guess it's good. Living in Minnesota the winters get pretty dry and he's not always scratching when he's getting his salmon oil. I do keep it in the refrigerator so it doesn't go bad.
2,Did it do anything? Anything at all?,"I have two dogs, one of which scratches for no apparent reason. No fleas, maybe some type of skin irritation? So I get a monster bottle of this fish oil. The dog that doesn't have a scratching problem just loves this stuff - would drink it out of the bottle if possible. The itchy little dog has no interest in it, but will reluctantly eat food with some oil dripped on it.I have now used up the bottle. The results? I tried, I really, really tried, but I could not tell any difference in the dogs after three months of twice daily servings of this oil. Coats looked no better or worse. Itchy dog is still itchy. Other dog wonders what happened to the tasty stuff.About the only positive thing I can say is since the oil ran out, they no longer have fish breath."
1,Not the result I'd hoped for.,"I have a fawn Doberman. Most Dobes have good smooth coats. Fawns and Blues generally have a variety of problems, the Blues worse than the Fawns. I'm fortunately that mine has no bare spots, but the coat is thin in places and a bit rough. I'd hoped the Grizzley Salmon Oil would help her coat thicken and become healthier.After reading so many favorable reviews I did purchase a bottle. I used it according to directions but even though so many commented on how their dogs loved the flavor, mine did not. I had to add it to her food to get her to eat it. We used up the entire bottle, to the last drop, literally. I noticed no change whatsoever in her coat, the thin spots are still thin, no extra shine, nothing. The oil is fairly expensive and to go through a whole bottle (which took several months) and see no change was disheartening. I won't be buying any more."
4,Excellent Supplement ???,"I have use Grizzly Salmon Oil for 4 yrs with older/grown dogs. But when I questioned my vet about using it on a 12 wk old puppy this was his reply: He stated that a lot of the supplement oils coat the gut and intestinal track of the pup thus making it harder for them to digest their foods and absorb the nutrients needed for proper growth. I have yet to notice any stool changes ie stools being larger or loose when I started the pup on the Grizzley Oil 10 days after we brought him home.So I did a bit of research on Google and found merely nothing on the affects of salmon oil. I feed a complete raw diet to all 8 of my dogs and the reason I use the salmon oil is to give them an extra dose of Omega 3 when I cannot provide them in the winter months, with fresh salmon. My dogs are a picture of health and I'm sure the salmon oil contributes to their beautiful shinny coats. But I'm just concerned now about the growth of my Standard Poodle Pup. Any feed back would be wonderful."
5,Helped to clear my dogs skin problem!,"My Cairn terrier has very bad skin and is prone to bacterial infections. She got a very bad one and I had to get her medication, but I thought I'd try this Grizzly Salmon Oil. I started putting on her food every day and her skin looks beautiful! I am going to continue using it to keep her coat nice and shiny. I told my vet I was using it and she suggested I also use it on my Norfolk terrier's food to keep his coat nice. Great product!"
5,"Oil for the ""Pack"".","This is good quality, competitive price and my dog's coats are shiny and thick. I have 5 Pomeranians and the pump bottle is convenient. I just pump once on each bowl of food."
4,It's a hit,"I initially bought this product for the vitamin value only for my 3 year old lab mix. She LOVES the flavor and literally licks her bowl clean 2-3 times, 'just to make sure'. The recommended dosage for her weight is 3 pumps, which I break up into 1 1/2 pumps 2 times a day with each feeding. I was skeptical about it making her coat shine, but after about 3 weeks, it has absolutely shined up and her coat feels softer which is an added bonus! I keep it refrigerated and buy it in 32oz bottles so it doesn't go rancid. I will continue to buy this product as I am happy with the results!"
1,Beware of possible side effects,I bought this product to help with my Maltese coats based on all the reviews. I did 1/2 a squirt per the instructions and 1 hr after the first (and only) dose she had diarreah and has had several episodes the next day as well as throwing up. My Maltse is not known for throwing up or having diarreah! Be careful using this product as I think its schocking to some dogs digestive system.
5,Terrific Product,"My dog has skin allergies and this product is a miracle worker. He doesn't scratch anymore. I put three squirts of oil on his food twice a a day. Beware though, I orginally purchased the 32 oz. bottle and it went rancid. The bottle did not say to refrigerate, only to keep in a cool, dark place, which I did. When the oil went rancid, I didn't know it. My dog just stopped eating. I recently read another Amazon review on salmon oil in which a person wrote about the oil going bad because they kept in a pantry where it was cool and dry. Now I only buy the 16 oz. bottles and I store it in the fridge. My dog is back to eating and the oil helps his itchy skin."
4,Dogs seem to love it. Noticeable improvement in dog fur texture.,"I purchased this at the suggestion of the Vet for my dog's fur, which had become somewhat coarse from moving to a new environment. Dog seems to love it (she waits until I put it on her food to start eating) and her fur has improved decisively.Only one star down because of the pump bottle. This is salmon oil. You really only want it on the food because it smells like fish (obviously.) But, sometimes when I put it away it will drip and then wherever the spill is it takes a cleaning to not smell up the cupboard. I suggest keeping this on a dish or mat of some sort for storing."
4,Product is very good,"This was recommended by a friend. She has her dogs on it and pleased with results. I too am happy so far with the product. Only thing I have noticed is the pump can ""hold onto"" part of last dosing and then drip out later in the cabinet. I put a papertowel around the neck so it would catch drips....That way I don't have a fishy smelling puddle in my cabinet.Otherwise, I really like the salmon oil. The dog's coats are shiny and feel more healthy."
5,pet coat help,what a difference in my pets fur. her coat is very soft and fuller.ps..... she loves the taste
4,Good product but too Fishy,"The product works great but it's one of the best out there for dogs. I've seen it and many ppl at the shows recommend it. Only downside to it is that I can't stand the fishy smell. My dogs loved it and it worked on their coats. But after licking all of it up, their breaths smelled like really bad raw fish. But it's a proven product to work."
5,Great!,"Doggies are much happier with a little salmon oil on their food - they were having itchy flaky skin and the problem has resolved since we started using this salmon oil. Trouble is, i switched their food to another brand at the same time so it is tough to tell whether it was the food or the salmon oil. Nevertheless, it is a combo that is working so we'll stick with it!"
5,Great Product!,This product is easy to use and the dogs love the taste on their food. It has really made the coats look great!
4,"Oil is great, packaging poor quality.","The oil seems to be doing its job. I have to Italian Greyhounds and their coats to seem to be a bit shinier, thicker, and smoother since we began using this product a few weeks ago (they get a 1/2 pump per day each). My only problem with this product is that the oil leaks all over the side of the bottle. The top is screwed on tightly and it is stored in a cool area so I'm not sure why it is doing this. I'm going to have to find an alternate bottle to put this in as I'm sick of getting salmon oil on my hands after every use--gross!"
2,Not For My Dog!,"I have a 7 year old lab who has had continuious ear infections ever since she was a pup. I have spent lots of money and trips to the vet for the problem...with no luck. I had put her on the Dinovite supplement which seemed to help a little but after reading all the reviews of this product, I figured I would give this a shot, since it is much cheaper. Well first my dog hates the taste and i am not seeing any results after having her on it for almost a month. For my doggie issues this product just doesnt work :(. Ill stick with the Dinovite and would suggest to anyone out there, if they are having the same issues as my doggie- cronic ear infections, constant licking and scratching,excessive shedding, to give Dinovite a try!"
4,Leaking,"The bottle had been taped like someone expected it to leak. It leaked all through the tape and into the box. It was pretty messy getting the soaked tape off of the bottle. After that, it cleaned up fine and I was able to use it normally.My German Shepherd loves it. No problems there!I will add that I ordered an 8ounce bottle also and there was no tape and no leakage on that one."
5,Amazing Salmon. Oil PURCHASE,It was completely worth it. Very inexpensive arrived quickly and sealed. I will definately buy again! Great product and my dogs love it!
5,my dog loves it,My dog seems to love this and she's a very picky eater. Plus her coat has improved since I started giving this to her. No dandruff and some skin problems have cleared up. As long as you don't mind fishy doggy kisses this is a great product.
5,Zeke approved!,"This product is an easy way add Omega 3 to my raw fed GSD pup, Zeke's diet. He would eat the fresh sardines I was giving him, but left the heads behind. Also, I had to have the fresh-frozen wild-caught fish shipped in so it was too expensive to purchase a product he would only half eat. I add the salmon oil on top of his food and he laps it all up leaving a clean bowl. He loves it.The pump bottle makes it convenient and easy to apply."
5,Two squirts a day goes a long way,"We give 2 squirts to our lab's dog food and in a few weeks, his coat is smooth and shiny. We also give a squirt to our smaller dog, and her coat got softer and fluffier."
3,"44,000 seeds ain't very many!","Nothing grew, but I figured at this price, who could go wrong? However, keep in mind that 44,000 seeds is a tiny envelope full."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY...,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... SEEDS ARE IN A BAG THATS ABOUT 1.25"" X 2"" AND ITS NOT EVEN FULL... SEEDS ARE THE SIZE OF FLEAS IF NOT SMALLER... WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY..."
3,Review,"Reasonable but many inaccuracies with poor English rendering occasionally and failure to explain variations allowed in German. Example of the latter complaint: ""Ich kämme mich"", ""Ich kämme mir die Haare"" und ""Ich kämme meine Haare"" are all valid I believe and yet no ref is made to the 3rd possibility and, even then, the examples are not consistent with the rule(s) introduced.For a reasonable fee my German wife and I would be happy to provide the corrections and suggestions necessary for the book to justify the interesting endorsement on the back cover."
4,Everything you Need to Learn German,"I was terrified when my 8th grader elected to study one of the few languages that I don't speak, but the Ultimate German program has since relieved most of that anxiety. The comprehensive grammar sections and easy to introduce dialogues make learning beginning German both effective and fun. The set includes 8 CDs for both classroom and homework use, and provide for plenty of practice time. I recommend moving more slowly than the lesson a week standard with younger students, as each lesson includes A LOT of grammar, but this program is an effective tool in introducing a modern language into your curriculum."
3,No Ordinary Love,"'No Ordinary Love' is my favourite track on this CD. I first heard Love Hewitt sing when my friend brought it home, it was only a few dollars. I just had to get it the next time I went to a CD shop. Her voice talent really surprised me. Who knew she could sing.I find myself singing along with Jennifer and humming them while at work! Catchy tunes with a great deal of talent."
4,Another very good album,"What can I say that I have't said in the postings for the other two albums of Jennifer's. Very good actress, very singer and a very nice lady. she stands as a real person understanding of the daily issues but she puts out an album to bring a joy of music to all who listen to it. It is worth the money to buy and well worth you time to listen to it."
4,Beautiful little gem.,"Jennifer Love Hewitt's career has been entirely over-looked. Listening to this album made me appreciate her voice just a tad bit more. While I'm not too big on the whole mid-90's sound of the music, her voice still manages to shine through the cheesy background music. I haven't give the album a proper listen, but Don't Push The River (Let It Flow) and (Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away really stood out to me. Definitely give those two songs a listen."
3,A nice cd to own,"I had this cd once before but it was MIA or destroyed so I replaced it. JLH looks very attractive on this cd and her singing chops aren't bad either. I really liked the song ""Last Night"" which stands out the most in my mind. If you like JLH then you might want to buy this cd."
2,The album is as bad as Joey Lawrences,Love needs to stick to acting and let the real singers make albums. The album is dry and all the songs sound like they were music from Saved by the Bell
3,"she can act,and sing","ok. i absolutely adore JLH. She is my fave actress! i have seen ALL of her movies and own all the ones that are released. but, her cd is not all that great. i mean, she has an AWESOME voice. but her songs lack something, im not sure what. i cant express how bad i feel saying that a/b her songs but its true. anyway, her voice does deserve praise but her cds need a little work. JLH, if you read this, im sorry if i hurt your feelings. i love you anyway!"
1,loves' review,"I've heard jennifer sing before and i think she has a beautiful voice! But i don't really care for the style, it is a little slow, don't get me wrong i like slow music, i just think she can apply her self better! My advice is for her to not be afraid to try a different root, like an alternative one! She shouldn't give up, she's got a god given talent, if i had hers i wouldn't no what i'd do, but i WOULDN'T give up!"
5,Jennifer Love Hewitts CD's are DA BOMB!,"I picked up jennifers cd's because I am a fan of her work on BYRDS OF PARASISE,MCKENNA,AND PARTY OF FIVE. I have over 250 cd's and LOVE'S are tied for #1 in my collection. I can't decide which one is better. Every song ROCKS! I'm listening to LETS GO BANG right now.Great ACTRESS, Great SINGER, and a HOTTIE. What more could you want. If anyone knows how I can get ahold of her first CD,called LOVE SONGS,please e-mail me."
1,Love is all washed up!,"I hated it! all of her songs were slow,and why is ""Love"" obsested about love?! I really dont think she can sing and her vocie is so so fake! Why is it that most singers have the Britney Spears voice, I mean come on if your to sing at least try to do it well. Take it from me dont waste your money!!P.s. i would not even give this cd one star but it wont let you"
2,In one ear and out the other,"Inoccuous, pleasant cotton-candy music for the teenybopper set. If that is all you're looking for, then great. Just don't expect anything really unique or special here."
1,Cannot comprehend,"I cannot comprehend why anyone in the world would dare to pick up this CD. Not only is she a poor shot in the acting industry, but a career in music proves only hopeless: waste of time and energy. If she wants some chance, she should at least go through vocal training. And maybe acting lessons wouldn't be a bad idea."
5,The most beautiful voice in the world,"Jennifer Love acts well and is very sexy and cute. As I heard that she also is a singer, I bought this CD without ever hearing one of her songs before. But this CD amazing! OK, the music is nothing new, but Jennifer has a wonderful voice. She really is a talented singer! And whose man's heart doesn't melt when Love sings about love? BUY IT!!!!"
2,One extra star just to be nice,"I'm surprised they ever let this kid enter a recording studio, not to mention, hit the big screen. Hopeless case in America or anywhere else in the world. The music is very dry, bubble-gum-like. Any serious (real) music just wouldn't fit her voice. Voice and style not appealing on any scale. Sorry. Might I suggest singing a jingle for a fast food restaurant?? At least singer is almost on key."
2,ZZz..zZZz..,"She has great voice, I'll give her that, but who the heck wrote the words and the music? This will put you to sleep right away. She needs to do more stuff that's not just a cheap replica of Speares/En Vogue (which is crap as well). Get this only if you are a huge fan and need this as memorabilia, or if you have trouble falling asleep, but I hope for her sake she doesn't waste her talent like this."
1,By George I think we've...got 2 go back to the drawing board,"I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark, yes for an actress turned singer she's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer... Would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal? I think not... Same goes for the other Latin Jennifer..."
4,"Cool, but needs a little more...","i like JLH and so of course I wanted this cd. but, i was a little disappointed in the beat. and the lyrics to ""I BELIEVE IN..."" don't make sense. But overall, a cool cd."
5,This is a good review of Jennifer Love Hewitt by JLH.,"I'm revewing Jennifer Love Hewitt by Jennifer Love Hewitt. I liked the CD very much because it was the first time I have heard her music. My favorite songs were ""No Ordinary Love"" and ""Never A Day Goes By"". I especially liked those to songs because they both have a tune that stays in my head. ""No Ordinary Love"" has a very positive attitude and no negative parts. She refers to having ""everything she wants right here"" and thats an attitude I enjoy to hear.""Never A Day Goes By"" was kind of like rock and roll but not heavy metal. It kind of reminded me of Sheryl Crow. The song had a steady beat to it. Throughout the whole CD she does not swear at all. I already told you why I liked it and I will defiantly recommend it to anybody."
3,Pretty good,"Jennifer does have a good voice. This is the best cd of the 3. I own it, and Never A Day Goes By is like the best song on it. For the people who think she can't sing she can. My fave song of her's would have to be How Do I Deal. Maybe one day she'll come out with another one, and better songs=)"
5,This C.D. Is the BEST EVER!!!!!!!,"If you didn't love her then, you'll absolutely LOVE her now!!!!! I used to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt, was just another actress, who wanted to sing, and couldn't. But then I heard her voice, and it was absolutely Beautiful!!!!!!! Buy her album, NOW!!!! It is great. Not only can she act, but she can sing, and she is absoluletly GEORGEUS!!!! THe number 1 song on here is don't push the river!!!!!! BUY NOW"
4,"Gotta Love ""Love""!","I am a huge fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt. This album is great! The best song on it is ""I Believe In"". That song was also used in the movie ""Trojan War"" that starred Love and her at the time boyfriend Will (Eric from Boy Meets World). I think Love should come out with another album that is produced by the same guy who did her AWESOME 1998 hit ""How Do I Deal""."
5,"gotta love ""Love""","all i have to say is ""Jennifer Love Hewitt."" where can she go wrong? nowhere apparently. shes sexy, acts, and sings. talk about a multi-talented woman who can turn anyman's head around at the sound of her name. she has a beatiful voice to go along with her body, and man does she have a body. but thats not all she has though, shes also great person. shes perfect in every sense of the word. this is a great cd. cant wait till her next one."
3,For Adult parties?,"Definitely not for 9 year-olds! This is a book of lists and questions - trivia games, fill in the blanks, etc. Not stand-up-and-run-around games, but sit-down-and-write-the-answer games. For adults, might be fun, especially if you were into Trivial Pursuit. As a teaching tool or brain-teaser, OK. For a kids party, un-fun."
2,It sticks,"The pre-seasoning came off after first use, tried to reseason in following instructions in the manual to the letter, came right off again and here I am, shopping for a wok. A different one this time. Hope this helps."
4,"Tins Collectors- Enjoy, Enjoy !!","A beautiful 152 page, 8 1/2 x 11"" softbound book contaiing more than 500, huge, sharp, beautiful full color photos. Some background information is included. Mostly a delightful picture-price guide ('98 pricing). Main topics range from breakfast cereals, candy, beverages, cookies and cakes to pet products, snacks, misc. non-food tins. A pleasure to view and enjoy the life-like tins. Superb photos and reproductions. Collectors will surely enjoy owning this book."
4,Modern Collectible tins,This book gives great descriptions and detailed pictures of the new collectible tins of the new era. The colored pictures are of vived detail and are a delight for the collector who wants to review the contents of this fine work often. I would hope that the author is considering expanding this fine work to other tins that are out there.
5,Where Has This Man Been Hiding?,"I first saw Richard E. Grant several weeks ago in the A&E ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", and became fascinated with him.When I discovered that he also wrote a book, I had to have it. I have just finished it and loved every word. He reminds me a great deal of David Niven and the wonderful book he wrote about his life in the movies, ""Bring on the Empty Horses"", but with names named.In turn funny, sad, and insightful about the oddities of the acting profession and thoughtful, without being pompous. I came away from this book with the impression that Mr. Grant is a nice man (and sexy)who happens to be an actor who can look at his profession with a jaundiced eye and a quirky sense of humour. He is both a participant and an observer. I can't wait to read his novel, ""By Design""."
4,This is a highly amusing book.,"I would recommend 'With Nails' to anyone. I knew who Richard E. Grant mainly from his role as the Scarlet Pimpernel in the BBC production. He was brilliant. This book deals with his earlier career. Anyone who has ever aspired to become an actor will really enjoy this book, particularly as it is funny as well as informative. I highly recommend Emma Thompson's diaries of 'Sense and Sensibility', which is very similar, though I have to say slightly more polished. Anyway, Richard E. Grant shows he has talent as a storyteller as well as an actor in his book."
2,i beg to differ,"reading the other reviews, i have to wonder if I read the same book they did! I got this HOPING it would be a witty and amusing dishy book on Hollywood life, instead it reads like a long scattershot set of ""and then i did this, and then i went there"". A sample paragraph is how he went to restaurant X, and then flew to city Y, to promote movie Z, then he called his wife, then he said hello to actor W, who said he liked his work. Yawn.I gamely plowed through the first half, then gave up."
3,He could charm the leg off an iron pot,"Witty, modest, insightful and charming, Mr Grant provides a delightful insider look at the making of modern movies from an actor's standpoint. This is the perfect book for that long flight. I'm almost tempted to see the cult film Hudson Hawk which has apparently made some Worst Movie Ever Made lists. On the other hand, The Player should be reckoned one of the best. A fun read."
5,A fabulously witty diary from the world's best actor,"What a treat this book is. For those of us who love him as an actor, he surprised us with a book all about his acting. It's witty, biting, and furiously funny, and what's more, involves people, scenes, movies and events that we can all relate to and identify with because they're real. It's not just a book for Richard E. Grant fans, it's a book for anyone who loves movies and likes to laugh. If you're in the least bit ""Hollywood"", it's a great read."
5,It's Time We Grow Up.,"Now we need to get folks to pay attention to our Humanity, at least to try to understand. This Book is a darn good start."
1,Not worth it,This book is more of a student workbook with high level general information. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Spun Gold,"Like THE SECOND SEX and THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE, Joan Gould's SPINNING STRAW INTO GOLD is less a book than an awakening. Half scholarly work, half exquisite prose, this work is profoundly moving, one of those books that illuminates a woman's life. Most girls love fairy tales, whether they are from mythology (""Demeter and Persephone"") or Hollywood(""Pretty Woman""). In a fascinating book that is destined to become a classic, Ms. Gould tells us why we are drawn to one fairy tale over another. Insightful, warm, beautifully written, this book is a treasure. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
3,Details of E.E. Just,"Black Apollo of Science, The Life of Ernest Everett Just in my opinion is a very excellent portrail of the complicated and exciting life of one of the leading black scientist of the early 20th century. If you are serious about learning every detail about E.E Just, then this is the book for you. It is the story of his life which goes from his early life and struggles to gain an education to hi later life where he fights to give other African Americans the opportunity to recieve a quality education. Although most of his life commitments were based to further the education of African Americans, he also had his own personal motives. He was a dedicated researcher who was not afraid to express his opinions at whatever cost it was, personally and professionally. This book offers great motivation to anyone that is fighting against the norms and against dicrimination. I recommend it to scholars as along to layman that wish to learn more about American scientifc history."
4,An excellent scientific biography,"It has been several years since I read this biography, but I still believe that it is one of the best I ever read. Ernest Just was tremendously hampered in his attempt to pursue a scientific career in Jim Crow America, as his skin color was held against him. Academic positions for African Americans were extremely scarce. What is amazing is the quality of work he was able to do in spite of such barriers. What might he achieved if he had not had such obstacles placed before him?But my greatest admiration is for those qualities in the book that would apply to scientists without those obstacles. The author conveys both what it is like to do scientific research, and the search for funding that is such an important part of almost all scientists' careers."
3,Some good ideas for the face,"I purchased this product for my 17 year old daughter as a gift, although it did not have as much for 'eye design' it had a lot of excellent tips for all over face make up ideas."
2,Good For Starters...,"A fairly good book, though she seems to have you put on too much make-up. ""Foundation is neccesary"" etc...when I used her tips I looked good, but a bit made-up! It has great tips, though, and is definitely a good starting book! For a more every-day book, with good tips and stuff, I would get Kevyn Aucoin's ""Making Faces."""
5,It all begins here,"I bought this book for my 12 year old Niece. I found myself going through it and learning alot of basics that at 35 I did not know. I do not wear make-up most of the time. But on those special days I will look great because of this book. Now that I am going to buy one for me. I feel this book is good for the beginners. It tells you about the basics for eyebrows, buying brushes, picking out if your a cool or warm color person, and more."
3,Underpowered,"I can not fault the construction of this piece. It seems well made and performs reliably. I purchased it to remove concrete from brick and granite pieces. I assumed the higher BPM and shorter stroke would be good for digging it's way in to concrete and mortar, but I was apparently wrong. It may be unfair to only give three stars since it may be well suited to another task, but I am disappointed. My $10 Harbor Freight gun is more effective at material removal. I have found this one works fairly well on delicate surfaces which gouge easily. It is, however, only a marginal improvement over running my other hammer at lower air pressure.To summarize. Good construction. Poor performance for serious material removal."
4,Good quality item.,very useful item for keeping things charged up while not in use. Also maintains battery strength for a long time and eliminates the possibility of battery replacement too soon.
4,Harness ease,installed this simple and ease solution to aid in battery refreshing during down time periods in the off season of riding.
5,It works,Does the job. Makes it so I don't have to take my seat off my bike just to plug in the trickle / charger to keep my battery fully charged at all time.
3,Standard Pin Connector,The setup is a standard 2 pin connector with ring connectors to attach to battery. The advertisement said it also came with alligator clips but mine did not. Does have inline fuse so you don't short anything out.
5,Review Battery Harness,"No issues, just as described. Used to connect my motorcycle to Battery Tender charger. Also connect to adapter to charge my cell phone."
3,Battery tender ring terminal,The terminals don't fit the charger that it is recommened with. Still sitting on my shelve unused; looking for a use.
4,Battery Tender Harness,"I used this product to make the panel quick disconnect from charge controller. From the solar panel connection to charge controller to battery connection. Quick and easy in less than a minute, the battery is charging. Only had to make I solder joint to hook up quick disconnect."
5,Perfect for second item needing battery charging,"This is the perfect companion to the batery tender,. If you have two items (lawn tractor, motorcycle, etc.) you can leave this connected and switch the battery tender between items."
5,Love it!,When used with the Battery Tender 081-0069-8 Female Cigarette Adaptor for Quick Disconnect. Used it on my Harley to charge my iphone while riding to listening to music.
2,Did not need the device.,This item actually comes with the Battery Tender Jr. I purchased. Since I didn't need two it would have been nice if the item description said this was an extra for use on an additional vehicle. I gave it to my son in law who also bought the Battery Tender Jr. and has two ATV's - so he needed the extra. Don't buy this if you purchase the Battery Tender product and only have need of one set of cables for a single vehicle.
5,Excellent accessory for modern day bikers,"This item easily hooked up to my battery and the quick connect end allows you to have different adapters like USB or a cigarette plug. The quick connect also has a cap to keep the water out. This is a great item if you have a GPS system, cell phone, etc you need to keep working."
5,Battery Tender Terminal Harness,"This is just a great accessory for your Battery Tender. I have several motorcycles and by installing this unit, I can switch between cycles without buying an additional Battery tender charger. I would buy this without hesitation and it is high quality and well made."
4,"havent used yet, but need to have a quick disconnect to marry it",This looks exactly what I expected. Does anyone recommend a quick disconnect that is preferably crimpable to braided cable so hat I can then connect this to my controller? I would hate to have to cut off the quick disconnect to wire directly if I can find something that I can marry to this.
5,WORKS GREAT! Let the Electrons FLOW!,"PROS:Tied to my Travel Trailer Battery to connect to my Solar Panel Charger.Quick Connect/Disconnect means you only mess with the terminals once, when you put this on the battery.Keyed so you don't create a short (Though be CAREFUL to orient it correctly on the battery posts).CONS: None."
5,Battery tender ring terminal harness,"Works well, just the right amount of cable to reach and keep away from the battery to make it safe and easy to use. Great product for the price."
4,It works as advertised,"This product works as described, I put it on my 4 wheeler and my motorcycle had one on it when I bought it, you just need to make sure and coat your battery terminals or they corrode fairly quick."
2,good on certain cars,Works well on a mustang...not so well on a chevy tahoe. Too short and fitting too small to get over accessory terminal on a tahoe.
3,Hard to place,The only problem is finding a route around the battery and out of the battery compartment. More an issue with the bike configuration but smaller harness components would help.
5,Nice and inexpensive way to connect your gadgets,"I was very surprised that the fuse is a 75 amp one. That's a lot of juice you can carry before the wires are protected. Great price. Like the battery tender setup.I have two alway on my battery now, one for battery tender connect, and the other for my cigarett lighter for my GPS power supply."
4,great accesory,"works great for quick connecting with multiple vehicles, made in china just like the battery tender it self, quite disapointing."
5,time saver. easy to install. awesome.,easy to install. works great and super easy to operate. makes life tons easier having one of these on each of my bikes. who ever invented this rocks. works with and goes great with the Battery Tender Jr.get it. you will have no regrets.
5,It works,It's a cable. It works. I attached it and plugged it into the Battery Tender and it appears to work. That's as good as it gets for a fancy wire.
3,Good but not as good as everyone says,"I do like this book, so far the recipes I have made are very good. It's not as ""spur of the moment"" as I would like. A lot of the ingredients are the kinds of things you have to buy ahead of time and a few of the recipes took longer than they said (maybe with experience it will go faster). That being said, I do think that they all turned out really well."
2,Received broken!,"This product came broken right out of the package. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it, so I glued it back together (it was the yellow end piece on one side, broken into 3 pieces) but obviously no one wants to receive a broken product. It's held up so far and the product serves it's purpose just fine, I just wish it had arrived in one piece."
5,Super gift for granddaughter,"This is a great gift for our artistic granddaughter--she will love it! It is safe for her to use, durable too."
3,"Good idea, but the paper is VERY CHEAP","I guess I shouldn't be surprised, as this is more a ""quantity over quality"" item. Meaning there is lots of paper for drawing, but the paper is thin. Really only good for crayons or pencils. Marker bleeds through and I won't even try paint for the same reason. I assume if you got better-quality paint, it would be a good combo with the roller, but the paper is the most important part, right?"
3,Cargen,"We purchased this product for our daughter last Christmas. She absolutely loves art projects and this seemed like a perfect fit. She uses it all the time and we love it, but it is definitely not heavy duty. The wood on the side split a week after we got it, but it still functions well. It is impossible for my 6 year old to get the paper under the plastic cutter so we hvae to do it for her each time. Overall for the price it is a good product. She used 2 rolls of paper this past year and we purchased another refill roll this year for Christmas."
1,dont know where to start from..,"the pronunciation guide is horrible, how the hell are you suppose to even start to learn the language if you can't even speak the words. Irish is by no means phonetic at all and the book just makes it harder..ugh.."
3,"Teach Yourself Irish Complete Course, CD package","Lots of information but in obfuscated format. Auditory is good, needs visuals, more conversations, fewer translations."
2,Lacking.,"I felt this book made too many jumps without connecting the dots. If I make another serious attempt to learn this language, I will seek out other resources."
2,"Too Confusing, Too Fast","Perhaps I just learn differently, but for me, this set does not work. For one thing, the c.d. has people shouting off Irish words in such quick succession that there is no time to repeat what they are saying. I suppose this cd could be useful if a person played it while they slept, but it is not a good program for those who learn languages by repetition."
1,Most awful language book I've have ever come across,"I have learnt more than a dozen languages by myself, including Hebrew and Norwegian, and I can assure you that this is the worst self-learning book I've ever come across. Although Gaelic is very difficult to pronounce and written in a way that makes French spelling look easy, you wouldn't believe how complicated the first dialogues are and how quickly the people on the recording read the words and sentences right from the start.I was completely discouraged and since the overall presentation is awful and ugly I threw the book in the dustbin in no time. Learning a language in the 21st century should not be a torture, methinks.Don't waste your money on this manual."
2,One main problem.,"This book is lacking in numerous ways, but its major problem is how it gives vocabulary notes. Instead of trying to explain the grammar and listing each word separately, it gives entire phrases (sometimes even sentences) as individual vocabulary items. How are you then supposed to use individual words? I guess if you're aim is to learn ""useful phrases"" for the purposes of travel, this book would work for you, but for an active understanding of how to speak productively, you're going to have to look elsewhere."
1,Worst Language Learning Tool Ever,"This is quite possibly the worst language system I've ever encountered. The very structure is awful. The CD is a single repeat (meaning you are constantly replaying it to hear the words again) and doesn't cover all the exercises, but skips over whole sections. The pronunciation guide is both long and nearly incomprehensible (and, once again, the CD runs through the words way too fast, not giving you time to repeat them and still follow along in the text). The grammar is cursory and there are errors in the answer-key, still, you might be able to pick out a few rote phrases if you are determined.I highly recommend both Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone. Also, if you are interested in Ulster dialect (there are three major dialects of Irish), the BBC offers a FREE language course which will teach you basic phrases right on their website.I would be highly impressed by anyone able to actually 'teach themselves' using just this series of language books."
4,teach yourself irish,very intense study. Hard to follow. you really are teaching yourself.I recommend this teaching to anyone that wants to get in a deep study of the Irish.
4,pretty cool 60s garage rock sounds,"being a big fan of 60s garage,I was eager to check this out.Out of the 18 songs on the disc,I liked about half.sweet young thing,dont need your lovin,sitting there standing,and milk cow blues,among my faves.I kinda wish it was stronger overall.If you can get it for the right price,go for it.But dont drop big bucks on it.Rock On!"
1,Crap of a gun!!!,Airsplat sent me a dead gun. I mean broken gun and then had the nerve to ask me if I was using the right amo. These guys suck and the gun sucked as well. It looked good but. What good is that if the darn thing wont shoot. Stay away!!!
1,good for 1 round,"this bb machine gun was delivered promptly, and worked great for the first round clip, but after i reloaded, and recharged with green gas, the o-ring fell out on the recharging port. i tried everything to fix the magazine(they hold both the bb's, and the green gas), but the only remedy is to buy a new magazine.the magazines are approximatly $28.00 + shipping, so the gun is collecting dust now."
3,Disappointed,"After the other raving reviews, I had a friend give it to me for my birthday, but was actually disappointed. I did finish because I felt obliged toward my friend. Summing up what I heard in over 2hrs: you are an artist before you have produced anything; you must be willing to enter the dark parts of your soul; art is toiling, dont give up and dont destroy. Estes' harped on powerlessly, obviously in love with her own voice but not considering the listener, making me fall asleep!"
3,marathoner,This is a good video for a NEW runner just getting into it. I met Bill Rodgers and he said to hang onto it because it is a collector's item.
5,AWESOME,"Angelic Upstarts, Vice Squad, The Outcasts, One Way System, 4 songs by The Vibrators ""Baby Baby,"" ""Dragnet,"" ""Guilty,"" and ""Hang Ten."" This CD has 23 songs on it!! It roxx."
5,Nice Item,"Added gauge to monitor the air suspension on custom bagger. It works great, recommend to anyone needing to watch there system."
5,Very Informative,"This book came highly recommended by Don Hamlton, DVM from New Mexico, USA. The book gives lots of conditions of animals and the best way to treat them. He does use nosodes to the benefit of the animal. He is very clear and easily understood. For the newcomer to Homeopathy, he helps with taking the case, selecting the remedy, how to manage the case. He also gives information on how to care for the remedies. There is information for different animals and the specific diseases they may get. He is also a practicing vet so his experience with homeopathic medicine is reliable. This book is a keeper in my library."
2,Burger Wisconsin says:,"The record On is fantastic and takes you back to when rock was a little less up itself and a lot more innocent. I highly recommend it to people who like Cheap Trick, Boston or the Cars."
5,Great Party Album,"I was in high school in suburban Chicago when Off Broadway was popular (at least in the Chicago area). Their first album is simple, straight forward rock and roll, and just a lot of fun. I saw them live in a place called ""The Edgewater"" in Twin Lakes, Wisconsin, and I had a blast. I still have the cassette, but I never thought I would find the CD."
5,One of the best party-rock ablums,"Off Broadway USA,""ON"", This is one of the finest albums to come out of the 80's.Its full of raw party rock-n-roll.It has songs that are straight ahead r-n-r.The band was very popular in the Chicago-land area and disbanded before the arival of MTV.This was thier first record and if you want a party album this is the one to get,and if you can find thier second record ""quickturns"" I highly suggest picking that one up as well."
5,Great Wild Dancing Music,"Saw them in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1980. They were great in concert! Songs had that Beatles feel..that fun feel, that innocent feel.What are Cliff or John doing these days?"
4,Great power pop,"I saw the 1979 Cheap Trick/Off Broadway show at the Amphitheater in Chicago. At the time, Cheap Trick were massive and people just wouldn't give Off Broadway a chance. I bought the record and loved it. Cheap Trick actually gave Off Broadway a chance to open for them (in the late 90's) at the Star Theater in Merrilville (or is it Hobart now?). Off Broadway put on a great show and it was nice to see how everyone in the audience has grown up, actually giving Off Broadway a well deserved applause."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"A Walker in the City seems like a book that I should like. Critically acclaimed and lauded, i expected it would be wonderful. Granted, Kazin has a way with words and description unlike most, however, ""A Walker"" simply bored me. Reading it in comparison to McCourts Angela's Ashes for a college course, I can't help but wish Kazin had resisted the temptation to describe everything in detail and tell us more about the people. He ends the book talking about a romantic relationship, yet tells nothing of the girl, simply the reservoir and park in which they walked. I can't help but almost be angry that he seems to have no value for human relationships, he rather bury his nose in a book or stare at a brick wall on the street. I see this book as missing the mark, having potential and good qualities but overall being an overdramatic, over-emotional boring description of his emotions and surroundings. ""give me a break"""
2,Durable but disappointing,"The quality of the material isn't as high as I was expecting, and the angled pockets look out of place. It felt durable but I didn't like it nearly enough so I returned the item."
5,Great for young children....and adults!,"I read this book to my son a few nights ago, and when I was finished, he immediately wanted me to read it again! My son obviously loves the book, and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading a children's book so much. The story is well crafted, and the illustrations are fantastic and fun to look at."
4,Good CD,Bought this for my wife for her birthday(she's crazy about everything ER)and she loves this CD.
1,ER Soundtrack - disappointing,"There have been some excellent soundtracks on ER, often performed by artistis and in keeping with the emotional theme of the programme. I hoped this would be a representative compilation but it was extremely disappointing in content. Certainly not what I was expecting and although not expensive was not money well spent."
5,"FORGET SIENFELD, ER IS THE #1 SHOW ON TELEVISION","Shame on tv guide for callling Seinfeld the best tv show ever. That title belongs to ER. I am writing this review after having just watched the tenth season finale last night. It once again proved that ER is and always will be the greatest show on televiusion. As for the soundtrack, it is pERfect! It contains music from the first two seasons of the show, from popular episodes like: THE BIRTHDAY PARTY, THE GIFTS, MAKE OF TWO HEARTS,EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN, HELL AND HIGH WATER, THE HEALERS, ETC. It also contains the well known theme. This is definatly worth the price. I suggest that the producers of ER as well as Martin Davitch release another soundtrack, one for the last few seasons, including music from episodes: ON THE BEACH, LOCKDOWN, CHAOS THEORY, HINDSIGHT, NOW WHAT, FREEFALL, NICU, FORGIVE AND FORGET, THE STUDENT, WHERE THERE'S SMOKE and last nights episode DRIVE. Until when and if they do thar, buy this cd. It's the pERfect cd for ER fans."
1,Not Quite As Described,"I bought this thinking that it could receive, strengthen, and repeat a signal without other hardware necessary or a wired connection.The description did not state that there was other hardware necessary for this to work in the way I was hoping, nor did it state that there was a hardwired connection necessary for the system to work.A serious disappointment and a waste of money unless you have a large area to cover and all of the other hardware for this set."
3,Hard Candy: Nobody Ever Flies Over The Cuckoo's Nest.,"I felt that the profanity was not needed to get the point across. Overall an interesting look into institutions. I was a little disturbed that most of the contentwas negative. I had worked in such a place for several years. Things have changed, true, but at least give the good points where they are deserved. There are many caring people who work in these places, not all is so sordid as portrayed in this book. I am speaking for the time era that the book covers. I, personally, would hesitate to read a follow up to this book."
1,Hard Candy,"As i have grown up in New Jersey and not far from the home in New Lisbon I was really interested in reading this book. I had visited the home in the 80's, giving out Christmas presents to some of the boys.Unfortunately, I was not able to read too many chapters because of the language. The language was very graphic and used more than what I thought was necessary. The ""F"" word was overkilled in my opinion."
5,Another inspiring collection of success stories!,"This is a great book, just like the previous ""Win the Fat War"", etc. I have a lot of weight to lose, and reading about other people's success inspires me and makes me feel less alone in the struggle. There are many before and after pictures too, which is nice. I'm never without this book, or one of the others in the ""Win the War"" series - whenever I'm tempted to overeat, I read an excerpt, and it stops me from sabotaging myself. I think anyone looking to break bad eating habits and/or lose weight will appreciate this book, and be inspired by it."
5,Looking for Love?,"Dr. Fuchsia Pickett is a great Bible scholar and excellent writer. She has the ability to open up Scripture and reveal the heart of God for His people. I have read just about all of her books and each leave you hungering and thirsting for the more of God and His Word! This particular book gives insight into the relationship between Ruth and Boaz like never before told. If you are prophetically gifted, than you will also want to read, ""For such a time as this."" It is an beautiful allegory on the Book of Esther."
5,Simplicity at its Greatest,"Love the simplicity of the music. The music is deep and rich. The lyrics simple but profound. Wish, the rest of their CDs were as good."
5,Sounds that will make you go nuts...,"The spirituality of this record is beyon words, the purity of the sounds, lyrics and music. And it has a certain touch of crazyness that makes this record special for moody times."
5,I'm addicted...,Boy oh boy is this a good album. I bought it shortly after it came out in the Spring of '96. It is STILL a regular in my CD player. EBTG puts it together so well. This is a classy album.
4,EBTG playing drum and bass riffs? You gotta be kidding me!,"This album is good. The only thing I didnt really like about it was the style of sound they've adapted. It's all drum and bass techno sound here. If ever you've listened to EBTG in the past, you'll notice that they had that jazz-pop beat that's so light and romantic. Now, EBTG has jumped into the bandwagon by going electronic. I have nothing against eletronic music, in fact I like techno music, but somehow Tracy Thorn's voice is drowned out by thumping bass and high hat hisses. I love Tracy Thorn's voice. She has a great voice! This album however didnt showcase much of that talent. Instead, it showcased Ben Watts new found toy--- electronic riff music. If you're hoping to hear Tracy Thorn sing into your heart on this one, you might be disappointed. If you're interested in hearing Ben Watts electronic gadgetry, then this album is full of it. If you're hoping to hear the EBTG jazz-pop sound in this album, well, you wont find it here. Try it."
5,A CD for (almost) everyone,This is a very dramatic work of art by the British duo.Heres what I think of each trackB42day-Great openerWrong-Has echoes of the Todd Terry Missing remix but is still a great listenSingle-Reminds me of acoustic EBTGThe Heart Remains a Child-^Walking Wounded- My least favourite trackFlipside-Great song!Big Deal-DittoMirrorball-see SingleGood Cop Bad Cop-Havent given much thought.....
5,Stands the test of time,"I originally bought this CD when it first came out and instantly fell in love with it. It dissapeared from my collection about 5 years ago and I have missed it since. I recently just purchased the album again and am very happy to see that the songs are just as charming and enchanting as they were 10 years ago. While drum and bass has faded into musical obscurity, the album does not fall into the trap of sounding dated. A timeless wonderfully enjoyable album from start to finish. Mirrorball and The Heart Remains a Child are true delights on the ears.To resort to an cliche, if I were trapped on a desert island this would, without question, be on my list of must have albums."
4,Emotional drum & bass,"In the world of drum & base there's not really any room for emotion. Everything But The Girl proved that theory wrong with WALKING WOUNDED. It's an excellent transition for Ben and Tracy. Their previous album, AMPLIFIED HEART, was a masterpiece in it's simplicity. WALKING WOUNDED succeeds with the band's curiousity of electronica and drum & base. Tracy's distant and droning vocals add to the constant beat and make this an enjoyable album. When you play this album, you're given the choice to either listen and take in the lyrics or just dance to the beats. WALKING WOUNDED is also filled with tender moments such as ""the heart remains a child"" and the amazing ""mirrorball."" WALKING WOUNDED is a great mix."
5,Sweet drums,"Im no Pro but once you get these bongos and tune them, they sound nice. I jam on them all the time and the quality gets better and better as the skins thin out, the sound comes out a lot more. Definitely worth 20 bucks!"
4,Wonderful adventure for kids...,This book is very visual and the story is fun. The ending is unexpected. Great book to read to a child or better yet have them read it to you.
3,There You'll Be,"Faith Hill may not be the best diva out there,but her voice is raw and emotional.There You'll Be,no doubt is a great song but in terms of the lyric,it loses to some other more meaningful songs from Mrs.McGraw.Many people compare this song with My Heart Will Go On by Celine.Both of these songs do have some distances in terms of perfomance.Celine performs that song with more passion and she knows how to control her vocal better than Faith.Celine uses her angelic soft vocal in the beginning part of the song,soft and smooth.But Faith's vocal is raw and unpolished.In the middle of the song,Faith's vocal starts to soar and i can't really diffenciate whether she is singing or yelling.The second track,is a gospel-like track,a fresh track for me.The last track is not my cup of tea,i usually skip it."
5,Great Vegetarian Dishes Cook Book,Great book - my girlfriend Susie had a copy and I lusted after one. Great to find a copy at Amazon. Thanks
5,Great Vegetarian Dishes,I love this book had it for years and misplaced it. Just had to get a replacement. I'm not much on eating my vegies but this book makes it easy and interesting. Really glad I was able to get a copy.
3,Save the Cat!,The overall story was pretty exciting but it started off a little slow. This particular reader could have done without the cat going down the garbage disposal. I felt it might give younger readers an idea that could endanger someones pet. The book would still be good without that scene. I prefered his writing when he wrote with Clive Cussler as it was tamed down a lttle more. Since I have six cats it would make my opinion lead to more leniency for the cat. It had very exciting ending but I may think twice before picking up another novel like this one if it involves abusing animals.
3,Our hero seems to be an alcoholic,"I have read and very much enjoyed former DuBrul books, but this one just seemed to go on forever, with geologist Mercer unable to keep up with the bad guys. Also, he seems to be either becoming or is, an alcoholic, as he just had to drink at almost every occasion. Also, at the beginning, he has Muslims drinking champagne - isn't alcohol forbidden for Muslims? Why cannot any of these action heros just find a good woman and marry her, for pete's sake? How about finding a woman of his own persuasion who could be his partnet in future world saving missions? I will read future DuBrul books, though Amazon says the latest is ""unavailable"", but doesn't say just why that is. Give this one lots of time to read or put to aside with a yawn."
2,Unecessary violence,"Having read nearly all of Clive Cussler's books. enjoyed all of them, and noting that Jack Du Brul has co-written a couple with Cussler, I decided to read some of Du Brul's writings.The first two books were quite enjoyable until I read Charon's Landing. It was long winded and too detailed at times, too bloodthirsty and provided unnecessary details such as the massacre of a cat, which was entirely unnecessary to the plot line and just made me feel sick and disgusted, ditto on the torture of the foe Rufti, which I felt made the hero Mercer and Khalid Kuddhari, just as bad as Rufti. I felt that Du Brul could have got the point across without this needless added violence, which to me was a turn off, in an otherwise very enjoyable book. I won't be reading any more of his books!"
2,Too many warts,"I tried to like this book, but could not ignore its flaws enough to get into the story. It suffers from wooden dialog, factual errors, grammatical errors, sophomoric philosophizing, and poor editing. Perhaps if the story itself was better told, I could have overlooked these issues. I'm usually willing to forgive a few errors (heck, I read Cussler), but it just was not worth it this time."
4,Mercer Is back strong as ever,"I just finished the unabridged audio book ""Charon's Landing"" I found the book a good read exciting, Hard to turn off. Jack B Du Brul takes you to many places in the world from Alaska to the deserts of the Middle East and the streets of England to name few. Character development is well done. The technical Aspect is explained well. The story is fast moving so much that I can't wait for his next book to see ware Philip Mercer takes us. Will it be deep into the bowels of the earth or the mysterious Orient? Maybe to the wondrous land down under. I think Jack B Du Brul is in a class that can stand between Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy at any BAR in the worldPAPA JIM"
3,The Indiana Jones of geologists returns,"Philip Mercer, DuBrul's hero, returns to fight KGB assassin Ivan Kerilkov in this densely written but action-packed thriller. People double- and triple-cross each other in the convoluted plot. Mercer works with the US government, who want to open the Artic Wildlife Refuge for offshore drilling, much to the consternation of ecoterrorist group PEAL.The book suffers from overkill (in some cases, literally). There are too many characters to realistically keep track of. The science is sound, to the author's credit. However, on page 420 he uses the absolute worst simile I've ever read: a person is ""screaming like a rape victim in a deserted parking lot."" How unbelievably tasteless of you, Mr. DuBrul. Hopefully, your writing gets better from here on out."
2,"too many bad guys, too detailed, too long","While I have liked du Brul's books in the past, this one must have pre his association with Patterson. It was simply so repetitive and overlay detailed that I speed read the last half. there were way too many bad guys. however, it was stll good enough that I will continue to read yhis books."
3,Probably Worth Reading,"I was impressed with Du Brul's first novel and recommended it highly. This novel does not quite come up to the same standard as Vulcan's Forge. While the plot is good, the story moves much slower than Du Brul's previous outing. I was disappointed in the apparent glorification of alcohol in this story. It seems like every turn requires a drink! I still recommend the novel if for no reason other than to follow up on the hero of this series. I do like the writing style and will more than likely read other titles by this author just to see where it takes me. I'm just hoping that the next Du Brul novel I read will bring me the same excitement that Vulcan's Forge provided."
2,NOT VERY ENTERTAINING,"""Charon's Landing"" marks the return of Phillip Mercer (first seen in Du Brul's previous novel, ""Vulcan's Forge"").Mercer must stop Ivan Kerikov, an ex-leader of the KGB's secret science division, who teamed up with an Arab oil minister, plans to take control of the US oil supply.Even though the novel does contain some good action scenes, it is peopled with too many characters and jumps from setting to setting every chapter.Half way through ""Charon's Landing"" I gave up, I just did not care what happened.Jack Du Brul has been compared to Clive Cussler, and although he does show promise, I will take a novel by Cussler any day."
1,Ugh...Boring and predictable,"Is there anything more boring and predictable than a hero who happens to be a mine engineer, and also happens to be a crack shot, a gutsy, two-fisted hard-drinking man of the world, a wizard at oratory, the owner of a stylish and sleek Jaguar, and the object of every woman's desire? James Bond has been done before and been done better. And the bad guys are Russians and Arabs. Yawn. Predictable from the word ""Go"". Of minor interest is the hero's (and presumably the author's) views on ecology. Apparently, attempts to reduce pollution and ecological hazards are direct subversions of the process of evolution. I told a friend of mine this once as a joke; I was startled to see it argued in all seriousness in print. Final point: This is a pale imitation of Clive Cussler, and I'm not saying that Clive Cussler's a genius or anything, but he can at least tell an entertaining story."
1,Yuck!,"This book is even worse than Du Brul's first, Vulcan's Forge. The only good writing in over 500 pages is found in the author's acknowledgements to the people who helped him. Too bad one of them wasn't honest enough to tell him what a rotten writer he is. Does this guy ownm the publishing company, or what?"
2,Techno Brasilian Reggae? Where's Macelinho da Lua's smooth tones?,"I was expecting more or that brasilian sound in this CD. I am not enjoying this techno reggae style. Not enough lyrics, and certianly not the brasilian sounds I was expecting."
5,awesome,"I bought this album based on the fact that I like the mad professor and I thought the cover art was cool... boy was I surprised by how good this album is. You listen to it once and think, yeah its a cool mix, and then later you find yourself humming those tunes and can't stop listening to this cd. I liked this so much that I checked out the original album by Marcelinho Da Lua, called ""Tranquilito"" and it was awesome- check it out"
3,Fit was iffy on my 5 year olds,"Needed two pair for my 5 year old twins. Toys R Us had them for $9.99. Unlike adult headphones, these are very stiff and don't have a lot of flex when placing them over the child's head. They may feel like they are squishing their ears.Also, the earcups are oval, but when worn over the head, the ovals are sideways (long end from front to back, not top to bottom). This led me to believe the headphones are really to be worn over the neck. That didn't work out too well.Pros: cheap. Good sound.Cons: Don't stay in place (tends to slip if child is active while wearing them). Oval earcups are in the wrong orientation for any ear."
2,Sandra Bullock Teenager?,"Unbiassed review not possible as I am a fan of Sandra Bullock, It is interesting how much younger and virginal Sandra Bullock looked prior to ""While You Were Sleeping"". The movie itself isn't otherwise worth while remembering - even the title, GVP"
1,This film fired a blank.,"I like Sandra Bullock, but I did not like this film. Sometimes I think when watching early work by now well known actors and actresses, we expect too much. Or maybe it's me. Sandra Bullock wasn't really seen that much, and the other ""school kids"" were pretty run of the mill. It was another example of guys hanging out, guys fighting, and the occasional girl passersby. Coming of age films as they are described, do not always hold true to that description. Unless you count how much you have aged while watching this movie. Sandra Bullock wasn't bad, but I would rather see one of her other films."
2,I returned it,"Well made but no assembly instructions and, most important, no way to carry this carrier, i.e., no handle on top."
5,"If you get one book on usability methods, make it this one.","I've found this book to be a terrific resource. It's comprehensive, practical and approachable. Kathy and Catherine take you through a wide variety of usability methods, explaining why and when to use each one. Highly recommended."
1,not the right picture,i cant really review this item because i thaght i was gitting the picture shown and that was not the case....
5,wasted money,"It was shipped fast and if needed this would be fine, but I did not need it, so it is wonderful if needed."
5,Very Sturdy material,Great product! Should withstand even the harshest climates. The product was received in a very timely fashion. Will purchase from vendor again.
4,Attractive and functional,This cover looks nice and serves it function well. I took away one start because it is a little difficult to get on.
5,Fire Pit Cover,"We were pleasently surprised to see how sturdy and well-made this fire pit cover is. It fits snugly on our 44"" fire pit. We have bought others that were supposed to be ""heavy duty"" but did not hold up well at all.We are very pleased with our purchase."
2,Fire Pit Cover,"This says it will cover a fire pit up to 44"" and in the photo, the lid is clearly on the firepit. It does not cover a fire pit that large. Our firepit is 40"" wide. It covers the lid, that is it. The rest of the firepit is exposed, not covered as the photo shows."
2,Cover too small,"The cover is good quality. However, I purchased it for the Blue Rhino Oil Rubbed Bronze Outdoor Firebowl. It was shown together on Amazon.com. The cover is far too small for this firebowl. So now i'm stuck. I will have to purchase another cover to cover the sides of the firebowl and then i can place this Veranda Fire Pit Cover on the top. It only covers the top half (which would let rain get into the sides of the firebowl)."
5,covers great,"i have a large pit, and bought this one knowing it was going to be a little bigger than needed. worked out great. covers completely, strong, thick material, even has handles, and fits snuggly. perfect. thanks!"
2,Not big enough,"I have a 30-inch fire pit and ordered the 44-inch cover thinking that it would be more than sufficient. I have the Crossfire Patio Fire Pit ([...]) and this cover does not cover the sides more than a few inches (leaving the bottom few inches open, thus defeating the purpose!).Another thing that I disliked about the Veranda Fire Pit cover was the attachment straps that are meant to go around the legs of the fire pit... They're only a few inches long and don't even come CLOSE to wrapping around the legs of my fire (besides the point that the cover doesn't even extend down that far)...Keep the box it came in; you'll need it for the return."
1,cover,"The cover sent was too small for the 42"" table. I had no idea that a 60"" cover would be needed. Now i have to pay to exchange it. You should have what size table it would fit in the description."
3,very nice but doesn't fit,"I bought this cover Veranda 44 to cover the Strathwood St. Thomas Cast-Aluminum Fire Pit with Table. I liked a lot both products, but the Veranda cover is recommended to cover that fire pit and it really doesn't fit. The cover is too small.I sent a letter to Amazon and the person who helped me was really kind and helpful and offered me to send the right cover for that fire pit, but I received again the same cover. Now I need to return both. But I have to say that the service was so good that I am very glad buying from Amazon, no mater the mistake because they respond in a great way. Every time I bought from Amazon I had a wonderful experience."
5,Veranda Large Round Pit Cover,This unit fit my existing very well. It is a waterproof durable material construction. I also like the handles for easy installation.The colors also compliment my patio.
3,holy smokes!,Down side: we still haven't figured out EXACTLY how to make this fit so we can use the handles.Up side: survived two days of NASTY storms beautifully!
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"This is a great product, very heavy duty and also fits a square firepit. Can't beat Amazon for what you are looking for and at a great price."
2,It wouldn't fit much,"Bought this with the Landmann's USA Fireball because it came up as a match when ordering the fireball firepit (as you can buy together for ""this price""). However, when received it only fit the top half of the fireball so it is not a match for that. The ad was deceiving and by the size I cannot imagine it fitting over many fireplaces/firepits. ON the strong side, it is a good heavy duty cover if you can find something for it to fit over properly."
4,***** RUNS A LITTLE SMALL BUT A GREAT COVER ANYWAY *****,"As some reviewers have noted, this cover tends to run smaller than what is required to realistically cover a 44 inch fire pit.That being said, if you have one of the excellent Landmann 40 inch pits like we do this will work great for you and it is definitely priced right."
4,Bigger and Better,"I just put this cover on my fire pit, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the material. I have a 40"" pit with a dome cover. This covers it completely with plenty of extra fabric. If it did not have the leg clips it would probably be too big, but I am glad to have something that covers it almost to the ground."
5,Landman Moon & Stars cover,I bought this cover to protect our investment of the Landman Moon and Stars Firepit. It works great.
5,Veranda Fire Pit Cover,"The Veranda product line has great quality. I would recommend it to anyone. The product was as described in the ad, it's size is just as stated. We are planning to purchase several other items from the Veranda line."
5,Highly recommend,"Size is the diameter of the cover, not the firepit. Buy larger than firepit diameter. High quality. Fits perfectly. Excellent protection from weather for firepit. Straps secure cover."
4,"60"" Version fit despite others reviews' claiming different","I have a 60"" fire pit and read all the reviews stating that it would not fit a 60"" pit and the 60"" version would barely work on a 40"" pit. I had a hard time believe that a 60"" piece of cloth was cut and it would barely work on a 40"" pit so I went ahead and ordered it. I'm not quite sure what the previous reviewer were referring to when they said it will not fit a 60' pit however the 60"" model fits mine perfectly and the product dose what it describes it will do. I left a picture with my cover installed on my pit on the products ""pictures"" page for customers.My only complaint it that it does not breath very well and moisture on the inside will stay as the material used does not seem to let it escape, but it also never claimed it would...."
3,Interesting,"This book has interesting points to it. However, for a reader who has grown to a real love for and understanding of the church, it gives little. I scares me that this book may help someone to develop the attitude of ""whatever you find to be ok is ok."" Today's world surely shows us that more than this is needed."
3,Good reading for the lapsed Catholic...,"thinking of returning to the church but at odds with some of the church's teachings. The author brings up virtually all of the controversial points of Catholicism and tells why you don't necessarily have to leave the church even if you disagree with some of the teachings. However, I hated the title, and I objected to the overall tone of the book. It implies that you can justify anything and still consider yourself a Catholic. No, the church isn't perfect, but I think you have to wrestle long and hard with your conscience to still consider yourself a Catholic when you disagree with church teaching . You aren't supposed to feel good about it! This book just doesn't convey that."
2,Paul Wilkes can do better,"As a read this book, I found myself asking the question, ""Good enough for what?"" Catholics that I know are seek to deepen their knowledge of God through the Church, not trying to be ""good enough."" This may be the author's form of Catholicism, but I found it rather depressing."
1,An Owner's Manual on How to Sin,"Well written, but troubling book that encourage Catholics to be...well, not Catholic. As Catholics we are all called to become saints. While for most of us (myself included) that is a slow and laborious process, and most of us are far, far from being saints, the reality is that ""good enough"" simply isn't good enough. I remember when I was in school, if I aimed just for a pass or a B, I usually got a poor result. If I aimed for a perfect test paper, I would usually get an A.Catholic truth and dogma has stood the test of time (2000 years). That it is difficult to adhere to, there is no doubt. I prefer to try to configure my life to an ideal, rather than to being just ""good enough"".I recommend that faithful Catholics stay away from this book, or simply read it as a testament to what is wrong in our society today. Do NOT read it as a guide for configuring your lives."
2,Paul Wilkes can do better,"I thought this was a flippant, shallow interpretation by the author of what a Catholic is. Practicing Catholics that I know have more respect for their faith and for themselves than to play this ""cafeteria Catholic"" game. We look for writings by reputable authors that will bring us closer to Jesus, not books that ""water down"" our faith.Other writings by Paul Wilkes led me to expect more. I was disappointed."
1,Bad Bota,The bottle leaks. You could take a chance on carrying it by itself and holding it with the opening upright.. It definitely leaks if packed with other stuff. I should have returned it . Unfortunately I was travelling during that period and missed the dead line. Darn !!
4,it was what i exspected.,"shiping time was good. the poduct was what i exspected. nothing special, just a bota bag"
4,Strangly alluring deck,"The majors of this deck are really well done, renaming and redefing them for those on a 'quest' of the soul. Very good stuff there. The minors use scenery, colors, lighting, object placemeant to tell the story of the card, which is very well done and the book really clairifies the story very well. Sometimes I forget that there isn't a person,animal in the card the story is so well flushed out. I don't think this deck is your typical fair and the titles of the minors/majors can seem rather pretensious at best, but the language is the time period and mystical and presented well enough. This isn't one of those decks that tell so much as challenge you to search yourself and give an idea of your journey along the way. It doesn't fortell so much as moves and acts on the hidden journey we all take."
4,Lasted about a year with moderate to heavy use and then the thong will break eventually,"good but dont expect them to be very comfortable. These made a good ""wet"" and ""around the house"" sandal. These gave me foot cramps from wearing them slightly too much but these would be fine as long as you just use them conservatively."
4,Shower sandals...what more do you want,Simple solid construction. Great for keeping the fungus amongus of my feet. You just never know how scuzzy the locker room floor can be.
2,Don't buy,"I bought this stroller to use with my daughter. It had all the features that I was looking for and some! After 2.5 months the bracket that holds the frame of the basket and supports the seat broke completely off, thus offering no support for the seat and a useless basket. I contacted Evenflo and they offered to replace the stroller with a completely different stroller in a different pattern, the one I have is no longer available and there are no replacement parts. I would not recommend buying this stroller."
2,A very frustrating read,"I bought this book after reading the other two excellent reviews. Well, it was a big waste of money for me. The book was not written in a clear, easy to follow manner. It should be rewritten in half the number of pages. Rather go for ""From Science to God"" by Peter Russell."
4,rigging knife,"Wonderful knife, does just what I wanted it to do. Helps to tighten knotwork. Sharpenough to cut the rope And a fid that is small enough to get between the strands. Wonderful."
4,Nice for the price!,"This review may echo others-a little rough on the fit&finish; and shipped dull,but very serviceable and handy.The one I got was stamped with the Davis logo and has a locking marlinspike.We'll see how this grade of stainless fares over time...and if somebody were to bounce it over the transom,thesense of loss wouldn't be overwhelming!"
3,Good Knife But Don't Twist it,I bought this knife because it's as close to a replacement for my father's rigging knife I could find. The price is right but the blade comes so dull you can't slice bread. Sharpened it holds its edge very well tho. The spike locks well. I lubed it before using around water and haven't had a problem. Sadly tho I have gone through two of these knives. The first was used to open a beer bottle and the pin behind the blade that keeps it stiff snapped. I had it replaced and a few months later under normal use (no beer bottle opening) the locking pin behind the spike broke as well. I got a 3rd as a gift but this will be Davis' last chance with me. I'll have to go with something more substantial next time.
5,Solid Tool,"I wanted a knife to keep with my bag of paracord so that I had something available any time I was working on a project. I received this as a recommendation because of some of the books on knots that I had purchased. The inclusion of a marlin spike made the knife attractive and the price was right, so I bought it. I'm happy I did. This is a solid tool. It's well constructed and tight. While the blade doesn't lock, it has a set position that does a good job of keeping it from closing on your fingers, but since it's just a cutting implement, with no ability to poke or gouge with, that's unlikely to happen anyway. Over several months of use now it's kept a great edge and it's easy to sharpen. It's cutting my rope quite well, and I couldn't be happier with it."
4,"Good knife, misleading image.","This knife is very well made. The spike, knife blade and shackle key all have great snap and hold their positions well. The only thing I don't like is that the marlin spike is not shaped like it shows in the picture. Every marlin spike I have seen is gradually tapered. This spike is one consistent diameter three quarters of the way to the point and then ground sharply conical to the tip. Maybe this is a recent design change but it does not look like the picture provided. I am curious as to whether other owners knives are like this. I think I might have bought a different knife had this been apparent. Either change the picture to represent the actual tool or better yet, make the spike a continues taper. I still like the tool and think it is a great value for how well it is made and will function just fine for me. I just think accurate information, especially a photo, is important when buying on line."
4,Great knife for the price,"Bought this knife for rigging ropes in tree stands. The blade sharpens well and holds an edge. My use doesn't require the wrench. So, I can;t comment on that item. The pick is a great feature for untying knots especially with cold hands. I can see the point made in other reviews about using this everyday, but if you aren't a professional rigger this is a good once in a while rigging knife."
1,Defective CD,"This CD when I received it from a private seller in Arizona SKIPS IN 3 places. In 1 place the song gives loud 'thump, thump' reports through the speaker. It may have disabled my JVC CD player. I would return the CD if I could for a refund."
5,Civil Forfeiture Laws,"Hyde's disclosure of this little understood but heinous law is excellent. As Hyde explains, under civil forfeiture laws your private property can be taken without finding you guilty of anything. Sound unAmerican? You bet! But it is all legal. Hyde clearly discusses the background and current practices and recommends reform in this area."
2,Forfeiting Our Property Rights: Is Your Property Safe,"Hyde obviously wrote this book because some constituent of his, probably as crooked as most politicians got taken to the cleaners. It is the unfortunate dilemma that we are in that people of power can get influenced so. My thoughts are that Henry probably felt he was next in line to get caught by the Feds and he figured he had better do something to limit his liability. Shameful I gave this two stars because he utilized proper english."
2,Dead drive,"Purchased due to cheap price and figured I could easily get my money out of it. Died within a couple of months light use. Won't even spin up. I prey WD tech support isn't as bad as comments make it out to be, but I am braced for the fact that my hard earned dollars are likely down the drain."
1,"Lack of Support, Drives fail","Lack of Support for Failed DrivesWestern Digital will not support your hard drive WHEN it fails. On November 16, 2004, I bought a 250GB hard drive. Three months later in February, 2005, I had to return it for a replacement due to a hard failure. Now, this replacement drive too has failed as well after only eight months.I went through two Western Digital drives in a year due to no fault of my own and the hard drive failed just six days after the warranty expiration. I requested a replacement from Western Digital and they completely ignored me.Buy at your own risk.Pros:NoneCons:Lack of Support Drives fail"
5,Sweetgrass,"This is one of the most beautifully photographed movies I have ever seen. I loved listening to the sheep bleeting & baaing & then the silence when they went to sleep at night. Parts of the film reminded me of ""Brokeback Mountain"". The realness of the lives these people led. These are real people not actors in a movie. There are some unexpected surprises in this film, ""aah"" moments. Also I would recommend ""American Cowboy"" on the Planet Green channel on tv."
3,Perhaps a bit too casually paced,"Perhaps a bit too casually paced. I understand the choice, and it works fine for individual scenes, but the cumulative effect on me is a loss of interest and increased detachment.Despite that, it's a pretty good movie, beautifully filmed, and worth a look."
1,A Disgrace to sheep producers,"As a Montana sheep producer I find this DVD disgraceful. No animal should be treated as the sheep are in this DVD. If the owner of these sheep were to view this I hope he or she fires everyone of these employees as this is no way to do business or treat livestock. If the owner is in this video, shame on you! This is not only poor business but puts Montana and sheep producers in a very bad light. I hope no one else is as foolish as I was to purchase this DVD."
1,Sweetgrass needs a narrative,"Sweetgrass has a few nice camera shots, but a lot of film shot in darkness inside a barn, and at night, and suffers greatly from the lack of a narrative so the viewer can understand what's going on. Even an old sheep rancher like myself was stymied. I wish I had my $25 back."
2,Too much Bad Language,I was going to send this to a dear friend. Nice lady who owns a ranch with sheep...very upstanding person that never utters a cuss word and I was apaulled with the foul language these sheepherders spewed...beautiful scenery and educational but cover your ears!!!
5,Wonderful book.. is there a sequel?,"This book about the height of the civil war and how each type of person would have struggled through it is amazing. With every page you feel more and more pulled into the action. The only question I have is... WHERE IS THE SEQUEL? There was supposed to be a third book and I have never seen it. If there IS a third book or even a manuscript, it should be sold in some way immediately because it's a shame to let such a wonderful series rest without completion."
1,So many things gone wrong...,"I had very high hopes for this bracelet, as I purchased it as a gift for my Grandmother. A friend of mine purchased two of these, and I thought it was quite odd when she told me that she wanted to get one of them reshaped. Amazon clearly has a quality control issue, as the bracelet I received was very deformed. I looked like it was flattened from what should have been a circle shape into an oval. I could wear it, but I would have to concentrate on how I held my wrist all night long. Any motion of the arm at all made it fall off!On a topic I know people don't approve of, the packaging was horrid. The bracelet was forced into a box that was obviously too small, as it was taped shut. Also, it barely fit in the velvet pouch it came in. Amazon should be relieved that this is not the only piece that I have purchased from them, because if it were, they would no longer get my business."
1,~~STRANGE~~ bracelet,"It was very pretty looking but virtually useless.It was open on the side which left no possible way to wear it without it falling off.I bought it for $18.00 but even at that price, it was no bargain."
5,perfect as usual,"Not much to say about these other than I'm pumped that they make it in a 4"" now, so I can use it on my double without needing two of them. The double ones are what I used to use, but they started making them really tiny a few years ago I think and I don't like them anymore. These 4"" ones are perfect for double pedals though.Added bonus: I didn't see this anywhere in the description but mine came with 1 white and 1 black, which is neat I guess. I didn't know they even made them in black."
3,It was helpful but not a true indication of what to expect,"Greetings everyone,I agree with one of the previous writers. This book was helpful with preparing with some of the content covered on the exam. However, the phrasing of the questions are more straight forward than the questions on the actual test. The questions on the praxis can be wordy and purposefully unclear. You may know a subject matter quite well but the questions may make you feel as if you need to be in the mind of the writer to understand what they are asking. I too left the test unsure of how I did. I am hoping and praying for the best. Good luck and I hope this review helps."
3,"OK starting point, but not really representative of the test","The book does a good job of organizing the main topics, but there are zero examples of each concept. The only examples are the actual tests themselves. The solutions for each test question are explained in some detail, and they're categorized by topic, but there were several typos (including a wrong graph used in one test question). The sample tests overall though were way too easy. I finished each sample test with at least 30 minutes to spare, but when I took the actual test, I didn't have time to work on about 5 questions - the actual test is much more difficult. I did really well but I think I learned more from reviewing some old textbooks."
3,Only OK,"This book was an OK reference for studying for the PRAXIS exam. There is a lot of errata, so make sure you check the publishers website before you start using it. The statistics section didn't bother going into how to use the graphing calculator which is much faster and easier then doing things out by hand."
2,You could do better,"This is a fine overview, but there are better products out there. I can tell from comparing this to official resources on the ETS website ([...]) that the authors don't understand ETS's question-writing strategy.There was at least one glaring editing error in a practice test which made it impossible to answer one of the questions.The tone of the answer key is repetitive and pedantic -- for example, the reminder to ""Devise a plan"" for every single question is not helpful."
2,Not very helpful,"The CliffsTestPrep Praxis II: Mathematics Content Knowledge Test book was not very helpful. I would not recommend it if you are trying to prepare for the Praxis II math test. It lacks examples in the sections reviewing math content. If you are like me and learn best by looking at examples (like math textbooks do) then this book is not for you. All the concepts were talked about in theoretical terms and they did not include practice problems for each idea. The only problems in the book were found in the practice tests. The practice tests were good, a little easier than the actual questions on the exam, but not by much. I ended up needing to find and use other resources to help prepare for the test. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
4,Too easy,"The practice exams in this book were too easy in comparison with the actual exam. Also, they did not provide a way to score the practice exams. I was a little disappointed in this prep book."
2,A little disappointed,The actual test was NOTHING like this book or the practice exams within. While it is not that the book is not good-it provides a thorough review of math concepts but it did not help me prepare for the test. The questions were phrased completely different and at a much higher level.
3,"Works, but could be better","I just took the Praxis Math Content Area exam, and I feel like because of this book, I did pretty well. There are plently of practice tests, and this book covers everything on the math content area praxis. However, it briefly goes over things without explaining them in great detail. For example, it tells you that a data set can be represented by a box and whiskers plot, but doesn't bother to explain exactly what that is. You'll have to look it up online. There are also many typos and such in this book. However, it's one of the very few books that's exclusively praxis II math, so if you want something cheap that can help you, then shoot for this."
2,"Useful for the practice tests, not much else","This book is essentially a rehash of the freely available information about the test from the ETS website with three fairly good practice tests thrown in (in fact it has references to specific page numbers from the ETS website material on almost every page). The review portion of this book is pretty useless. The authors have taken the ETS statements of what content is tested, given brief definitions of what each of those content items is, and completely neglected to give any sample problems to illustrate how to actually do the math. If you're buying this book for anything other than the practice tests, I suggest you search elsewhere. Most egregiously, this book also fails to do one of the most important things for any test prep: explain how the test is graded and give you the ability to generate a practice score. Three tests, three answer keys, no conversion chart for a score?!?"
3,A good base to start your study.,"I believe that for this review it is important to tell you what I thought of this book AND what is the best way to prepare for the test.I was a non-traditional test taker. I hadn't taken a math class in 6 years, and furthermore, the only college math I had ever taken was pre-calc, discrete, and stats. So clearly, I needed some serious preparation.I passed using this book and one other critical resource, praxismathexam.com. This book was useful in that it steered me in the right direction toward what theoretical concepts I needed to master. The practice tests were a good warm up for the MUCH better practice tests on praxismathexam.com.With this book alone, I would have failed miserably. The practice problems are easier than what you'll see on the real thing. I would have been misled into thinking I was ready when I wasn't. This book did give me useful information, but praxismathexam.com is your best friend."
1,Waste of time and money,"This is basically just a list of definitions grouped by subject and then three practice tests with poorly written questions. It does cover legit material, so it won't necessarily hurt, but the actual ETS test is much different."
2,Very disappointed,"Took exam Jan 15, 2010. It did not resemble the three sample tests in this book. Maybe it did back in 2006 - but not in 2010. I thought I was prepared for the exam, but I was not. I have a strong math background (electrical engineer) - but have not looked at some of these types of problems in over 20 years. This book can be used as a review - but don't expect the high school content math test to look like the ones in the book. There are a number of errors in this book. The review book would be much more helpful to me if they showed example problems in the section reviews (there are examples in the sample tests - but they don't cover many of the topics - such as the topics on the exam.)"
5,Happy with product!,"The book came in perfect condition. The delivery was very speedy even with the free savers discount. Overall, I would definitly buy from amazon again!"
3,"A good review, but the praxis is really hard","This book offers a very good crash course in all areas covered by the praxis. It's very formal, and the front cover says it offers exercises, but I didn't see any. However, it was really good about giving formulas and examples of things you might not have seen in a while. Be forewarned, the Praxis covers a LOT of ground. This study guide gives you the score you need to make for each state, but doesn't give what the score is out of (I BELIEVE it is out of 250, but please do your own research on that)There are a few mistakes in the practice tests, and a few repeats, and the questions asked in the practice tests are different than the ones asked on the praxis, but overall, it was a good sampling and it was a good way to prepare for the praxis."
4,Good but not perfect.,"Some comments:Other reviewers had good points: book does not show enough examples in the review section. This would be the quickest way to get a point across. Book has some typos and incorrect answers in sample tests.Tests in this book seemed easier than actual Praxis.Some good points: Book is very focused on the 0061 test - inexpensive way to focus effort on useful subjects. This book was more useful than the programmable calculator I bought for the test.FWIW, I have an engineering background have not taken a math class in about 20 years, studied for a week with this manual and got a 192. One disclaimer: I'm good at taking standardized tests."
3,Better than ETS study guide,"I would definitely recommend this study guide over the ETS guide. The review information is pretty thorough, however, there are no examples. I used this book in preparation for the Praxis and did see some of the exact same type questions appear on the test. Be aware that there are several typos in the book. Also be aware that the real test is much harder than the practice tests in the book. I haven't had a math class in 14 years but studied the topics in this book and passed by a wide margin. I would recommend it."
3,Praxis Book,"Book was not exactly what I had hoped for. Contains sample tests, but no sample problems within the chapters."
2,doesn't hit the mark,"I agree completely that the practice tests provided are too easy. This book is a good place to start, especially if you're more than a few years out of high school. But, I'd supplement it with something else, if not take a chance on a different book.It seems like the writers looked at the objectives of the test then anticipated what the questions would be like. But I don't think any of them have ever taken this test. Most Qs on the actual test were multi-step and the method was not as easily apparent. The practice test Qs were must more direct.Also, I noticed two typos in mine: one graph did not match the question (matched the one before it) and the other was a wrong answer given in the explanations at the end of the test.Overall I'm very disappointed in Cliffs Notes. You got me through high school alright but you left me out to dry on this one."
2,Don't Be Cheap. Get All the Help You Can to Pass.,"If you're really and truly feeling swamped, people, get help: you can find help here, or through a study group, or through a prep class, or whatever else works for you... but please don't suffer alone. I started looking over the material last week and am starting to panic!You know you need to get that ""magical score."" Talk about sheer madness!and this book can help you, but I've seen a few even better. I also used the Praxis II Mathematics Comprehensive Success System at praxis-test-coaching.com. Here you get tips for breaking down the questions into what they are really asking. Teaching Solutions has a diagnostic test you can take to discover your strengths and weaknesses. This allows you to focus more of your study time on your weaker areas. Above all get all the help you need and of course use more than more book for this career defining test. Don't be cheap."
2,Great for Good will Hunting,Unless you are Good Will hunting and can absorb information like a sponge this book is not for you. When they say cliff notes they mean it. No examples no practice problems no nothing. The only reason it got 2 stars is because the tests are more legitimate than the other book. Still not as hard as the actual Praxis test. Still no great Test review options.... Good luck
4,This band should have made it - exc. CD.,"Storyville is a guitar band with some great guitar riffs and excellent vocals. This band has a slight R&B feel but also reminds me some of Bad Company. They feature Stevie Ray Vaughan's Double Trouble. And I think had the expectations not been so great for this band, they might have lasted a little longer. However, because many thought they would be a supergroup, the pressure to sell tons of records was maybe a bit much. It is too bad because this is a very good band.They sound the best on the ballads as their harmonies are just superb. David Grissom who wrote most of the songs on A Piece of Your Soul, is at his best on the ballads. My absolute favorite is ""Share that Smile"",if Top 40 radio was still around, this would have been a big hit. Stand out songs on A Piece of Your Soul are ""Good Day for the Blues"" (tr#2), ""Don't Make me Cry"" (tr#4) and ""Share That Smile"" (tr#11)."
5,"Great record, Arc Angels continuity, without Doyle and Charlie","If you like Arc Angels, Double Trouble instrumental, you'll like this record. Great riffs in the blues rock style. This is the best Storyville album, their debut. I also recommend ""Been a Long Time"" from Double Trouble."
2,Too Tight on My Feet,"I got my Fiancée and I a pair of these in preparation for our trip to San Diego. The first pair I received was too small so I sent them back for a larger size (the saler was very pleasant to work with). The larger size still felt too tight across the width of my foot. I have small feet for a male (size 9) and I do not consider them to be extra wide by any means. I also found my heel slipping off the back. I gave them a fair break in time but they never improved. They now sit in my closet unused. I prefer my sandals to have a looser fit, if you are the same way I would look else where.On a positive note my Fiancée loved hers and wore them around the whole time we were in San Diego."
5,Simple and Important,"I placed it in the middle of the house so I will get a picture of who entered before they turn off the security system. :)Still works 4 years later. :)Suggest buying extra keytabs, because two just isn't enough."
2,Lacks most common connection,"This comes with a bunch of phone adapters, but not a micro usb, the most common for cell phones so I actually haven't been able to use it yet,"
2,Turbo Charge TC400,I was very disappointed to find out that this charger did not have the connection I needed for my phone and had double of other chargers including two of the flashlight heads. So needless to say I was not satisfied.
4,Almost Perfect,"Works perfectly for my daughter whose phone uses a mini-USB connector, but there is no fitting for my micro-USB connector for my phone. Guess what I did with it? That's right, my daughter got an emergency charge, which is OK. She forgets to charge MUCH more often than I do."
2,Looks like it'll fit to me - not.,"0ops, should have checked the list first. Does not fit many cell phones. Mine is a Nokia 6103 and none of the 10 adapters fit and they do not carry them at the turbocellcharge website they recommend you go to get the right one."
2,Disappointed,"Most of the ideas in this book just seemed so silly. I am a petite woman who has a hard time finding clothes that fit, even when wearing petites. The little cartoon drawings made it even worse. This was a big waste of my money. Given the other reviews, I thought this would be a good alterations guide. I sure was wrong there! I wish I could find a book on alterations for petite women who want to look professional."
5,Great for wardrobe updates,Borrowed this book from my quilt club library and knew right away that I had to have it. I sew for my grandhildren and frequently find fabulous items at thrift stores and yard sales. This book is a godsend for altering clothes. The price was perfect too. Thanks to Amazon.com I was able to find a copy right away. Thanks.
4,Better Later than Never,I purchased this book ten years ago. Over the years I have used it over and over again for quick fixes and ideas for a wide range of problems and fixer-ups. Yes the book was published in 1995 and expect it to be dated but get over it as most of the information is stillgood. This morning I picked up again for a certain problem that I was trying to resolve with a pair of Pants. Guess what? I found a solution. I was wondering if there was an updated version so I tuned in here and sad to say there isn't. One shot deal I guess. PS. Glad that stirrup pants are a thing of the past!
5,INTRIGUING STORY LINE,I wish Beth Sherman had written more books. I have a hard time putting it down. I like books with a similar story and location.
3,Good Protection with drawbacks,"I purchased this case to show-off my Product(Red) 2G Nano. I like the case, but there are a few drawbacks.1) The removable click-wheel protector is useless ... I had to press hard enough to activate the menu controls in order to adjust the volume. I removed and discarded this piece.2) The case is too big to fit into my Apple iPod Nano dock and the adapter supplied is not compatible, so I have to remove the case everytime I want to sync (or charge) my iPod. The case is difficult to remove, but so far has stood up to repeated removals.I've only had it for a few weeks, so I'll come back and update this post after a month or two."
2,Tool's conservative father,"2 1/2Not a huge Rush fan by any stretch, so I can't recall why this album was one of my choices to explore their more modern sound. The single title track was decent enough, but the album fails to create much traction with mediocre riffs and preachy lyrics making a persistent average quality even more self-consciously, over-the-hill-rock annoying. Good thing there are enough chops interspersed from preventing complete erosion of the senses."
1,"Oh Dear, more middle-of-the-road-drivel","Yet more inane nothingness. Rush was the only band I would listen to as a teenager in the late 70's early 80's and it's been a long, slow, sad decline since their last decent album which was Moving Pictures. I can remember with absolute horror, the release of Signals and GUP. Forever lost is the majesty and raw spirit of 2112. So, so, sad. I feel truly cheated."
1,Unspeakably bad,"I'm not gonna waste a whole lot of my time pointing out all the reasons why this album is (IMHO) a festering pile of cow dung. What I will say is shame on Rush for thinking this material was worthy album material. All the songs sound like B-sides to me, some being stronger than others of course, but B-sides all the same. Skip this one at all costs [unless you're a completist, in which case you'd be forgiven (barely)]."
3,Not quite Power Windows,I bought this a while back and just can't get into it. I haven't been able to get into any of their stuff since Presto. I admit that I'm more of a fan of their stuff from 1984-89. What happened to the keyboards? Rush is about change. The album cover and liner note illustrations are neat though. Power Windows RULES!!!!!!!
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"Between the many many albuns RUSH recorded, i think this one is not one of the best...I like songs like TIME and MOTION, DRIVEN and TEST FOR ECHO, but most of the album is really pop....I prefer COUNTERPARTS and ROLL THE BONES over this one...."
3,almost brilliant...almost,"As a hard core Rush fan-atic (for years)I gotta say this was a disapointment. So many great riffs, so many inspired themes. But the riffs never matured into completely fluid songs. Too disjointed and abrupt. If you look back to Signals or even Permanent Waves you will see cutting-edge experimentation, and each song has fluidity and a tune that flows thrugh the whole song. Some of us had a hard time getting used to it at the time, but when we look back at it, we love it. Now, T4E still has cutting-edge experimentation, but the moments of their usual genius are broken up, and in my opinion, ruined by unrelated lesser tunes. Sigh...... I don't know if I will look back at this one and love it. But it IS Rush, and it is better than a lot of the rest of the stuff out there."
2,Solid and unremarkable,"This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound. There aren't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous. There's still good stuff on here -- The frantic ""Dog Years"" may be the first (intentionally) funny Rush lyric, while other highlights are ""Driven"", ""Carve Away the Stone"", and ""Resist"". This is not one of the band's better albums, though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it."
3,"Neil really gets on a soap-box, sometimes less is more","Sometime less is better.The music is very good. Alex's power full cords 'n riffs, Geddy's pounding complex bass and Neil's magic on the drum kit is still there, but Neil get's ""wordy"". Neil has always impressed with me with the lyrical content he puts into the albums, often poetic, powerful and to the point. I get the impression that he reads a lot from ""old dead wise people"". Neil has a lot to say in this album, and is very passionate about what he is saying. I thought that Neil tried to jam too much into the song lyrically. The elegance of past seemed to be missing on this album."
4,Fan-friendly extra content,"There are plenty of online reviews as to the music Rush put on this album, and I've listened to a cassette copy of it since it came out; after selling the cassette deck I finally bought the CD. What impressed me was what happened when I put the CD in my computer. In addition to the CD files, there were directories where the contents of the album were available in wav, mp3 and ogg format. This makes it much more fan-friendly (but then, Rush usually has been better about that than a lot of other bands) than just a plain CD. This way I can transfer the files directly to my portable mp3 player. It is more content for the money in my view which to me as a serious Rush fan is icing on the cake."
2,The Weakest Rush Album I have ever heard,"I love Rush. I have just about every RUSH album on CD. But let me say this: this album is mediocre. All the songs sound the same. The guitars work is distorted and noisy, and the lyrics are pale in comparision with their earlier work.Do yourself a favor and buy any one of their fine earlier works. You'll be glad you did."
3,Rush - Dog Years Indeed,"Rush took several years off after ""Counterparts"". Alex Liefson recorded his ""Victor"" project and the band was even rumored to be broken up at one point. So it was with great anticipation that fans looked forward to the release of ""Test"" in 1996. Unfortunately this album was a letdown and in my opinion is one of the band's weakest. It starts out really good with the first two tracks ""Test For Echo"" and ""Driven"" getting things off on a rocking high note. After that things begin to fall somewhat flat. ""Half The World"", ""Resist"" and the instrumental ""Limbo"" are all decent. The rest, although tolerable is nothing that is going to stick with you for a long time. ""Dog Years"" and ""Virtuality"" have choruses that are particularly annoying. Rush has never made a bad album, and if you are a fan this one is worth owning, but it is far from essential in my mind."
2,A rare mis-step for a great (one of my favorite) band,"It pains me to have to do this, but the passing years have solidified this album in my mind as one of the worst offerings Rush ever made. The few highlights of this album (""Driven,"" my favorite track, features some of Neil's most inspired and complex drumming ever; ""Resist"" and the title track are also strong) can not counter the lackluster songwriting and playing of the remainder of the album. The weaker songs are a combination of corny (""Half the World,"" ""Dog Years,"" ""Totem""), dated (""Virtuality""), or just plain boring (""The Color of Right"")."
2,A Rush Classic? Nope.,Test For Echo has a few decent songs but as a whole this album is pretty much forgettable. The title track and virtuality rockharder than Rush as since it's 2112 days. Unfortunately both songs are plagued by really bad lyrics. The two songs on this albums that are worth having are Driven and Resist. The version of Driven on Different Stages is more exciting as it has a wonderful live feel and sports a rare bass solo by Geddy Lee. I am not a fan of ballads but Resist has an emotional edge typical of the band. The rest of the songs you can listen to once or twice and never have a desire to hear ever again. Test For Echo like all Rush albums sports incredible muscianship. However the songwriting here is lacking. For diehard Rush fans only.
2,There But Not There,"Speaking frankly as a musician who when younger was VERY inspired by early Rush, namely Fly By Night, Caress Of Steel, I just have to say that this recording sounds extremely flat. I'm a RUSH appreciator, I have a more discerning opinion.. but if u ask me, they haven't made a good album since Grace Under Pressure. Come on guys, recover that intertwined grouping and connectivity of songs, coupled with abandon and HUNGER, that you had in your younger days, there is still a new frontier for all of you. No need to sound fat and lazy. dig deep."
2,Not really much anything,"I was listening ""Test for Echo"" when I started wondering what would reviews say about it. Then I found myself surprised of all sort of diverging and passionate opinions. Is it really THAT good? Is it really THAT bad? I tried to remember the songs but, exceptuating the title track, nothing came back to my mind. Not even the titles. Then I realized that the best way I can describe it is: FORGETABLE. I've been listening Rush music for 20 years, and this is first time that I can't find a song exciting enough to make me hear it again three or four times. Maybe I'm getting old. Maybe they are. Maybe is a problem of the expectations we've come to set for the band. Well, I don't feel ecstatic about it, but neither I feel betrayed as some reviewers. Maybe just a little disappointed."
1,What happened?,"I have been an avid Rush fan for 20 years, so I was very excited when this album came out. But what can I say, other than, I'm dissapointed. One of the great joys of listening to Rush over the years has been their evolvement as a band. T4E not only doesn't cover new ground, it is a poor imitation of their previously brilliant work. Eventually I had to take it to a used music store and sell it because I felt it was wasting space on my shelf, and had been a waste of my money. I hope the next record comes back and completely blows me away. But Test For Echo will forever be a gap in my extensive and loved Rush collection."
1,What happened to the dynamics?,"I had to force myself to listen to this album more than once to be certain: every song is at one level, that is, ear-splittingly loud, from start to finish. I've stayed faithful to Rush for two decades, even when they experimented with ideas I didn't much like, because I know they are all about remaking themselves and embracing change. But now that they lack the slightest bit of dynamic variation, I've had enough. I even saw them on this tour at the San Jose Civic, CA, and while I loved their choice of vintage songs (even doing 2112 and Natural Science in their entirety), I could barely hear them due to the lousy venue. In retrospect that was the perfect venue to support this unlistenable album."
1,Lame!!!,"Rush, in my oppinion, is one of the best prog bands in history. But TFE is one of the most boring albums in prog-rock history. I got this CD (unremastered version) for my birthday this year just to pretty much complete my Rush collection. I it popped in my stereo hoping to get the awsome stuff I had heard on Counterparts but noooooooooooooooo!!! I found the title track which is pretty good, and Driven, an awsome song. The rest was just plain crap to fill up this 12 track disc. Its a waist of money and a waste of time to go out and buy this CD."
1,They sound like they should retire.,"I take a backseat to nobody in my love, admiration, and knowledge of the works of Rush. Which is why it pains me to say that this is an awful album.... the worst they've done. It's too bad Neil used this album to make his long awaited instructional video.- lazy songwriting- passionless performance- nobody sounds good here, but particularly sloppy and lazy guitar work from Lifeson. He sounds like he's drunk. This is the guy who played La Villa Strangiato???There is not one memorable song on this album.... nothing. Even some of their other ""poorer"" albums (Presto, RtB, CP) at least have a few gems each to redeem them, but this album has nothing. I detect a downward trend here."
2,Did I get the right software?,"Not so sure not so sure, is this the software that tests and records the echoes that emit inside a structure? I know you can yodel all day long in a canyon like they show on tv but I thought this was the software that allowed you to test and record the echo itself. I did get some interesting feedback when I first used it but I was not sure because it is an English voice actually saying echo. I think this may be a Microsoft tool licensed to a third world company and resold here. Just not sure what to make of it but I will keep trying to use it and hope I can further my echo research!!!!"
4,Continuing with the Rush string of phenomenal music.,"RUSH continue to prove that they can write some of the best music available. Well-seasoned after some 19 albums, Test For Echo shows these three musicians, each at the top of their art, will stop only when they're good and ready."
3,Test for sound quality,"I love this band. I have been a fan since the beginning of their amazing run. I am not in love with this release. I would definitely rank it as one of their worst in the modern era. The title song Test For Echo is very very good. Unfortunately it goes downhill from there. Not to mention the sound quality of this cd is not as good as weve come to expect from this exceptional band. Someone starting to listen to Rush, i would recommend getting Grace Under Pressure, Counterparts and Snakes and Arrows for ""modern"" Rush and of course Hemispheres,2112 and Farewell to Kings for older Rush for a good mix. Again, TFE is not one of their best."
3,Worth a listen.,"I don't listen to Test for Echo that often. I do think that it has some respectable moments, though. It's pretty much in the same direction as Counterparts--a hard rock sound with not much keyboard usage. The musicianship is tight. The production is good, too. I don't really have any favorite songs. If I had to pick, they would be ""Test for Echo"" and ""Time and Motion."" ""Time and Motion"" is quite cool--I also like the keyboard parts. Some of the other tunes sound a bit like filler, though. They're just not that memorable or interesting. That doesn't mean that they are bad, though. Neil Peart's lyrics are good. The CD booklet is also very impressive. The album cover and the graphics inside are really nice. Test for Echo isn't a personal favorite, but it's still worth a listen."
4,"A more obscure, dark outing from Rush","These reviews have pretty much hit the nail right on the head in terms of what this album is - or isn't -, but I'll be the first to admit this album is an acquired taste. For me, this was probably the most difficult Rush album to truly pick up on and appreciate since Caress of Steel. The songs are not nearly as catchy as their predecessors, and they don't have a traditional Rush feel. What Test For Echo has that the other albums do not, however, is a grandiose display of the true talent of the band. This album, more than any other, shows how talented this trio can really be. The actual structures of the songs are surprisingly deep, with each instrument contributing in superb ways, with some exceptional harmonies to accompany Geddy's singing (which, I may add, is his best on any Rush album). This album is best described as an album that musicians can truly appreciate, and not for the casual listener."
3,A decent but awfully forgettable album,"This is the last album Rush has done since their ongoing hiatus, which is soon to be over. The lyrics in this album are first rate, imparting extremely admirable goals for a better world. The musical value however leaves much to be desired, sounding too clichesc. The only two songs which stick in my mind are Totem and Carve away the stone. The rest are OK, but easy to forget. This is a mediocre showing for (what I consider) the best Canada has to offer. Geddy Lee the lead vocalist has a new solo album ""My favorite Headache""which is vastly superior to this and much more worth your while."
4,kicking,"I was a big fan of Rush as a teenager but began to lose interest when the likes of ""Presto"" and ""Roll the Bones"" came along. Although they are not all that bad, they seemed to be becoming more and more clinical in their production and feel. After seeing ""Test for Echo"" at a bargain price I decided to give it a shot - initially I couldn't get into it but after a few days a was playing it on a loop! This is really heartfelt stuff with some great grungy riffs from Alex - faves of mine are Driven (which I could really relate to at the time), Dog Years (the lyric about the hydrant had my mate in stitches) and Virtuosity (check the kicking riff!). It looks like this may be Rush's last Album and as such it's a good job it's such a solid one - Recommended!"
3,Forced lyrics detract from the band's great tightness.,"The first time I heard the title track on the radio, I got the CD. I think this is the best the band has sounded since ""Moving Pictures."" Unfortunately, I also think that maybe Mr. Peart was trying too hard to write socially relevant lyrics, and they often feel forced (listen to ""virtuality"" if you don't believe me.)"
4,THE PARTNER OF COUNTERPARTS.,"Test For Echo is without doubts, baptized oneself the ""Partner Of Counterparts"". I explain this point of view: While Counterparts is an album composed of strongs musics, Test For Echo is quite more fragile, speaking psychologically. I'm not saying that Counterparts is better than T4E, or vice-versa. Only I say that exists a ""relativity"" between two albums and is possible to explore this aspect(Observe: ""...electromagnetic force..."" in Speed of Love!). For example, we consider the songs Stick It Out & Resist as opposite among itself(See this sequence in Different Stages A Live album! Coincidence?). Actually, it's true but, both songs belong at Rushian's 4-phase. Freud analyses... effort versus fragility..."
4,Excellent,"I can't understand the bad reviews of this disc. The music is lyrical, complex, hard and soft in some spots. As usual, the performances are first rate. Why the negativity?I've had it on in my car the past four weeks and haven't tired of it yet. I love the time signature changes on ""Time and Motion,"" among others."
4,Guitar-Driven Rush Comes Back,"I had to write this after reading a reader's review that he just can't get into this album because it is neither Power Windows nor representative of Rush during the period from 1984 to 1989. The reason this album is so good is because it doesn't sound like their music from that period, which was too heavily keyboard oriented. This album brings Alex Lifeson's guitar back to the forefront. The best thing they've done since Moving Pictures. Check out Half The World."
2,This is not what many fans would expect from Rush...,"This is, infact, the ONLY 'Rush' album i would give 2 stars. Why? Well, in general, I do give this album a 'little' respect, but, it's just the...""mood"" of the album thats just not, Rush-like. The only few songs one the album I give credit to is ""Test For Echo"", ""Driven"", and ""Virtuality"". So, to conclude this review in shorter terms...""T4E"" dose not get listened to very much around here.Hopefully we can expect ALOT better material in the next album..."
2,Solid and unremarkable,"This is the sequel to Counterparts, with an even heavier sound. There aren't many memorable melodies and after a while the crushing guitar riffs get a little monotonous. There's still good stuff on here -- The frantic ""Dog Years"" may be the first (intentionally) funny Rush lyric, while other highlights are ""Driven"", ""Carve Away the Stone"", and ""Resist"". This is not one of the band's better albums, though fans of Counterparts may enjoy it.[This review is based on the 1996 original release, not the 2004 remaster. I have no problems with sound quality on the original.]"
5,Great Book!,"francisco@yoursocialstyle.comOn these day of tech-changes and everything is changing up side down, never has been as necessary as it is now to nurture relationships. When Visionaries like Peter Drucker mention that knowledge society is here and we can prove that, the theme of social styles show us the extent of relationships at work, and in personal life too!Saludos desde Ecuador,Francisco"
2,"Overall, not good for building beginner's confidence","I agree with the reviewers who said this is not a good choice for the true novice. The prepatory chapters were easy for me to understand, but in the technique chapters, it assumed this reader knew far more than she did. It could have used more photos and much more detail. I'm looking for a book with greater details, diagrams, photos and maybe a glossary of terms.So Eager to Sew,Marsha"
2,Lacking,This book is really not the beginners guide I was looking for. It is probably better designed for someone who already knows something about sewing. It covers much material quickly but not throughly.

1,Book written by a mad christian.,"I was curious to read a book depicting the experiences of an author that had lived the 60`s and the indian culture, but what i found is a pamphlet of an egotistical person who never understood deeply the indian philosophical system, nor understood her own religion (Catholicism) to the extent of not knowing who is Jesus. She blames Hinduism and yoga for her unbalances with drugs.And when attacking hinduism, she never cites hindu scriptures nor any references books.Really bad book."
2,Will come off too easily even on the cleanest ipod,Even following the directions on the packaging it will come off. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,Not the whole story.,"While this documentary makes several good arguments regarding the negative effects Wal-Mart stores have on some small communities, it conveniently ignores any positive contributions Wal-Mart makes to local and international economic communities as a retail powerhouse.Nevertheless, the overall message of hypocrisy is very agreeable. It is evident when juxtaposing Wal-Mart's corporate messages with the reality of their business practices, such as disregard for the environment, the well-being of overseas factory workers, and the US employee benefit programs. Furthermore, I found it appalling how the company gobbles up millions of dollars in tax subsidies for construction while sending its employees to Medi-care programs and food stamp offices."
5,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G,"awesome. great. so incredibly informative. it really does a good job at showing you exactly why wal-mart should be taken down. anyone who watches this and does NOT realize how evil that company is and how unbelievably immoral their actions are, is absolutely insane. WATCH THIS MOVIE."
3,"Excellent yet so morbid, I couldnt watch the whole thing","Despite being very left-of-the-centre (or so I believe) and a small business owner too I just felt my heart break watching this documentary.Just how the poverty line with the people that lost out cause Wal-Mart moved in and those that work for it made me realise the truth and evils that may come with a corperation, and how much it resembles a virus.I just couldnt finish it. You might enjoy it if you can stomach watching peoples lives get destroyed by this sort of a company, but i couldnt.I gave my copy to a local high school for their social sciences classes that grades 10-12 take."
1,Baseless Accusations,"Mr. Greenwald's credibility is shaky at best. This newspaper review hitthe nail on the head:""But Greenwald overplays his hand when he features a family hardwarestore supposedly crushed by Wal-Mart in Middlefield, Ohio. 'The Wal-Marthad nothing to do with that store closing,' Dan Weir, the villageadministrator, told me. The store struggled after being passed fromfather to son, and died before Wal-Mart opened.""You also don't learn from the movie that the store was taken over andrenamed Middlefield Hardware by Jay Negin, who told me business is goinggreat. For the record, though, Negin said he doesn't like Wal-Mart'semployment practices and won't shop there.""Negin and Weir could not think of any businesses in the village of2,233 that closed after Wal-Mart opened in May.""Stuff like this makes me wonder what else in the 98-minute movie isn'tquite true."" (Jim Stingl, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel)"
1,Too Simple,"I purchased this DVD because I thought it would raise some interesting questions regarding the business practices/strategies of Wal-Mart. However, this offering is not very sophisticated and only addresses some of the well-discussed issues at the organization. This documentary is not of the investigative quality that this issues/topic deserves. Save your money and time...."
1,A dangerous documentary filled with lies.,"There's a problem with this documentary -- it's the lying.The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote an article documenting the lies in the ""documentary"":""A scathing documentary on Wal-Mart's business practices focuses its cameras squarely on Middlefield, zooming in on a family-run hardware store forced out of business by the retail giant's recent arrival.There's only one problem: H&H; Hardware shut down nearly three months before a Wal-Mart Supercenter opened around the corner in mid-May.H&H;'s founder and patriarch said this week that the big-box competitor wasn't to blame for the demise of the business.Last week, the hardware store reopened under new ownership.""If you want a truthful account on Wal-Mart, watchWhy Wal*Mart Works and why that makes some people C-R-A-Z-Y!"
1,"Too simple, tries way too hard...","The most damning footage is Wal-mart's own internal anti-union ""training"" videos.Unfortunately, such clips are severely under-utilized. Instead, be ready for constant (mostly) unsubstantiated blanket statements and on-screen statistics with little to no context given (other than the music, which is decidely ominous).I stopped watching when the DVD literally started blaming Wal-mart for murder and rape. If you are looking for something engaging and educational, skip this. This documentary has only one goal: to make you HATE Wal-mart."
3,Walmart: The High Cost of Low Prices,This movie is quite eye opening. WalMart really needs to step up and be accountable for helping their employees rather than their pockets. I think all those who shop at WalMart need to watch this movie. I used it as a teaching tool for my AP English class. They were appalled at what they saw. This movie was more of a documentary but well worth watching.
4,Wal-Mart - The High Cost of Low Life,"This brilliant documentary outlines the affects that huge conglomerates have on their employees, on surrounding businesses and on the 'little people'. An eye-opener and a must for all people to see.An insight into off-shore factories and the human-rights issues - simply to bring goods into these stores at a lower cost.Wonderful to see how many communities have reacted to Wal-Mart encroaching on their environment.As a result, I think twice before I purchase goods made off-shore - particularly when they are really really cheap."
2,Despite good intentions this film fails to deliver,"As the title suggest this film is an attempted expozay of the evils of Wal-Mart. In the familiar fashion of the modern documentary style it is structured around interviews with former employees, members of the community affected by Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart commercials, and news items - and makes no attempt to offer anything but a biased viewpoint.Sadly despite its good intentions this film fails to deliver. It is poorly filmed and poorly edited. Many interviews lead nowhere. The film would have benefited from a narration to bring some coherency. We only hear from disgruntled former employees and community members. There are no interviews with ""experts"" or Wal-Mart itself to tell the other side of the story or lend weight to any of the allegations.""Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price"" fails as both polemic and entertainment.If you want to see an excellent documentary on the evils of big business then you should check out ""The Corporation"""
2,"very one-sided, works only part of time","i just watched this and am surprised that the critics raved. at least half of the film is a complaint against capitalism, both domestic and globally. many of the criticisms leveled against wal-mart would apply to every other retailer. no one seems to care that if wal-mart was brought down by its enemies, you'd have the same problems with a new enemy. but this is mostly about feel-good liberalism that isn't really concerned about the true victims."
1,Just plain Bad,"Just plain bad. Here are my reasons:- The documentary has very few facts. Lots of first hand interviews, but those are more for emotional appeal than to prove a solid point.- High school level film making. Choppy editing. Music levels are often higher than the dialogue.- The parts (or acts) of the film (employee wages, effects on local econimics, etc,) are poorly defined. The transition from one topic to the next is rarely well executed.This film could be good:- if it was shorter- if there was an narrator to outline the points at the very beginning. Also, use the narrator at the beginning and end of topics, or at least, a title stating the new point to be made.- if more effort was placed into the editing. It is a rushed job at present.For a truely well-made documentary:""The Corporation"" by Jennifer Abbott & Mark Achbaror[...]"
1,"Typical Liberal ""Documentary""","Walmart is an american success story. Giving many less Fornunate a chance and an opportunity to share in Sam Walton's Dream.Parade of Misinformation, in same manner as ""inconvenient Truth"".There hould be a ""0"" Star Rating."
3,"Interesting, but not an Oscar contender","I found it somewhat interesting, especially how scroogy the Waltons are, giving less then one percent of their income to charity and building a private high-security fallout shelter; while Bill Gates gives almost 60 percent. I am not sure that I learned a lot, Wal-Mart's business practices are well known and copied throughout the world. I think it would have been better to have shown it as a broadcast television documentary, like what you see on Frontline. It wasn't worth my 10 bucks. Most smart people don't shop at Wal-Mart anyway."
1,completely false,or should I say half truths supported with lies. For fiction it is like 2 out of 5 but there is little to no fact in this.
1,The High Cost of Poor Documentary,"This documentary had a budget of 1.5 million dollars. They should have invested that into solving the problems they see Wal-Mart has created. They did not use balanced reporting to get across the point that Wal-Mart is unethical. Everyone knows that, but the prices at Wal-Mart are too cheap for anyone to boycott them. The filmmaker talks about how Wal-Mart does nothing for the community or its employess; the filmmaker could have used the 1.5 million to do something instead of making this piece of garbage."
1,disc producer equally guilty of exploitation,"America loves an under-dog, and it seems it does so to a fault. They seem to hate any corp that is ""too big"". They're down on Microsoft and suing them. Now they're starting to sue wally. Wally should pack up and leave the states that do this and see how the lower class feels. They need someone like them. Not everyone shops at Whole Foods! This wally bashing is an upper class phenomenom. I grew up in a small town and wal-mart #10 came in. They said it would kill down town. It changed it, but didn't kill it. The Kenney's shoe store that was so expensive I could only get one pair a year is gone, but a nice art shop is in its place.If you want to bash a monopoly, bash the schools and the teacher's union that keeps us from having choice there! That is what will kill America."
2,Don't insult legitimate advocacy with personal greed,"Shame on Robert Greenwald for trying to capitalize on fear and ignorance to make money for himself. He accuses Walmart of greed, yet appears on television to claim that it's okay that he's making millions of dollars off this movie. It's the same sort of dual standard that enables him to criticize Fox News for not presenting balanced reporting (in his ""Outfoxed"" documentary), only to turn around and show only one side of the Walmart debate. Legitimate advocacy requires that the messenger have credibility. By presenting easily disproven statements about Walmart as ""fact,"" Greenwald has severely damaged the credibility of those genuinely wanting to influence the company. Clearly Greenwald's goal is far from the noble horse he proclaims. He's just trying to get our money. I cannot hide my disappointment."
1,Ha Ha Ha,"I guess this is a way to be punk moron. Trying to go against everything trying to be a rebel or something. This has to be the most dumbest argument ever. If you are blaming walmart might as well blame everyone that works there cause they are participating. So, go to walmart and tell all the employee's that they are ruining business. Without out employees there would be no walmart so go talk to them about your punk ways. Tell them to quit there jobs to fight your cause. You need to find a new fight cause this one is pointless."
5,WalMart,I bought this product because of a recommendation from a friend. I liked the fast service and ease of ordering.
3,ya it's a good movie but...,ya it a good movie one issue that I was not familiar with was that the security at wal mart is only concerned with protecting there merchandise and union busting there are many crimes committed in the parking lot and wal mart does noting to stop it. I would have liked to see more about how WM pressures supplier to move to sweetshops to lower overhead that is a real interesting aspect that is not really not talked about much. You always hear about how WM treats there own employees but they also put presser on other co. to treat employee poorly it kind of a domino effect that moves forward and backwards in the supply chain. I would have liked to see more about that.
3,Great movie if you already hate wal-mart,"Here is the basis of the story (I hope I don't ruin it for you)1. Wal-Mart hates its employees.2. Wal-Mart uses foregin workers (and they hate them too)3. Wal-Mart hates the environment4. Wal-Mart hates everything but money.Now, if you think that is new and refeshing buy the movie because you'll enjoy it. If you just hate wal-mart just because then you'll enjoy this movie. If, just if, you love wal-mart because they trade their financial resources to create jobs worldwide and provide a low cost product without destroying anyones pivate property--you'll just get migraines."
3,This thing was too long,They could have effectively got their point across in this documentary in half the time. And could someone please tell the movie producer to use a tripod next time? There is nothing worse than interviews where the camera is not stable and swinging all around.
5,Excellent,"Wal-Mart employees are being exploited, but not as badly as the Chinese. Don't buy anything made in China! Wal-Mart stores have destroyed local mom-n-pop stores; and not just one mom-n-pop per city/town, but several! They take good paying jobs away from the hard working and then give them the pitiful job at their huge stores."
2,Ok but nothing new.,As I viewed the dvd it occured to me that most of the stuff they were revielling about Wal-mart has been around for quite awhile. In fact it was on television last year.
1,Facts are Stubbon Things,The facts are not on the filmmaker's side. It's docu-fiction from the Michael Moore School of Film. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it zero stars.
3,Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price review,I haven't watched the film yet but I am waiting for a good time to watch it.
1,Moral Myopia,"The same people who produce this drivel claim Walmart is ""pure evil"" because it offers a much wider variety of goods to poorer households.Hello, no one is forcing the customers into Walmart at gun point.Likewise for the employees. No one is forcing them to work at Walmart. If they do not like the goods or the work, they can go elsewhere. Apparently the customers and employees disagree with the premise of this ""movie.""These self appointed and anointed fools demand ""diversity"" and ""choice"" except for those who really need it. In their book, ""choice"" and ""diversity"" is only good when they get to decide how it is defined.What a waste of time, effort and money by a blinkered fool."
1,This DVD is false advertising....unlike WalMart does ; ),"I go to Walmarts about every week since there's one right up the road from me. I have NEVER seen anyone look sad or upset there. Yes, I know it is true that they don't get payed that much, but if they were ever mad at how much they get payed, then why do they work there? Think about it, they choose to work there. No one is forcing them to but themselves."
3,Wal-Mart - interesting Doco,"This documentary is not bad. It brings some issues into perspective. Although it is shamelessly biased and does not offer a very balanced view of Wal-Mart as a company, it has some entertainment value. Sitting through the long version was somewhat painful, and I recommend the short version as the only one worth watching."
3,Freezing,"This one of a few Law and Order dvd's that I bought, In sent one back because It wouldn't play at all but two others freezes that I bought. Other than that I do enjoy watching the dvd's some of them are doing just fine."
3,Caveat emptor.,"It was a great season, with Moriarty, Merkeson, Noth, Hennessy, and Jerry Orbach. The writers were at the top of their games and the definition on images is fine.A problem. One side of one (of three) disks doesn't work. It stutters and stops dead. You wind up missing four episodes. The problem has cropped up on other sets of the series as well.For this price, you expect the disks to work perfectly, especially in the absence of any worthwhile extras.I'd love to buy boxed sets from the other years but I'm not going to do it -- not just because I resent paying for poor quality goods but because having an episode flicker and freeze after five minutes is too frustrating an experience to be endured."
5,stainless,this is a second purchase of the gorham monet. it has a good weight and cleans easily.this purchase was for a much lower price since it was purchased through amazon and not a department store.
2,This won the National Book Critics Circle Award?,"This is just the type of book that wins these types of awards. Goldbarth's poems tend to be prosey and verbose. He has some good ideas behind the poems, and a few good lines. But that isn't what we read poetry for--ideas. Where are the images that can't be forgotten? Where is the play that language does so well? This is a poet like Jorie Graham, one who tries to say something, then gets bogged down with free association. There is some good stuff in the poems, but as a whole they are a let down. The opening poem, ""Library"" happens to be a poem where this works, but it is a list poem, and you can get a little wordy in those. The book runs a little long for a poetry collection (over 120 pages). Goldbarth could have used a good editor cull it some."
3,Not quite as cool as the old days...,"These are similar, but not quite as good as the balsa planes of old. Specifically, they are not as good at wing adjustments, as they lack the slight curves in the slots that allow you to give the plane more or less lift. The other change is that the rubber band seems more anemic - our plane simply couldn't lift off from the ground under it's own power - we instead had to throw it. So, it's a cheap thrill, but the long winding with the short result made this toy not as much of a hit as I would have thought.It really, really needs a stronger rubber band that can pull harder and longer so it can take off. That said, for the price, this is still a classic that brings out the nostalgia in us all. :) I'd recommend trying to splurge for a higher end model in the hope it works better."
4,A fun toy for my daughter,"It is fun, durable, less expensive model plane for young child. My 2.5 years old daughter loves watching the plane flying off my hand. It is easy to assemble and make adjustment to correct flying error, since there is no need to glue parts."
4,I buy these every Christmas,"Got the Marine Corp's toys for tots program, in hopes the five young boys can find the same pleasure I did playing with these"
1,What a disappointment!,"If you are wondering if you should purchase this book - I would recommend on finding something else. I enjoyed the beginning of the book even though it was about one woman being walked all over and lied to by 'her best friend'. But when Carol finds out that the love of her life (Rick - who is also her 'best friends' brother) is sleeping with his sister, I wanted to chuck the book out the window. What is that? Apparently in England people don't mind that incest goes on, it was just gross and ruined what could have been a good story. Most people write about what they know..... I just thought I should warn you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO,"I wish I had read the bad reviews before I bought this. There is absolutely no instruction on dance moves. First of all, it was embarrassingly obvious that none of the three strippers with ""several years of experience"" had ever stripped before! The only thing I can think is that the creators wanted us to feel good compared to them. The extreme lack of talent and looks of the three women was indeed nonthreatening. Do not buy this video if you want to learn dance moves. It does give ideas about placing candles and wine around the bedroom or bathroom."
1,I thought it was a joke!,"This video was a total waste of time. I thought it was a joke. It looked as if it was made in somebodys house. The women were tacky, the ""costumes"" even tackier. No new or useful information is presented. If you don't already know all that is presented in this video you must be a nun."
4,Fun How-to Video! Present for a Wedding Shower?,"While not as racy as the title might suggest, How to strip for your husband has some good advice for all women (of all sizes and shapes and ages). The interviews with real strippers are interesting and the basic techniques and suggestions are worthy of note - however they should have included a list of where to get props... If you were worried about how you might look *stripped* you might feel better after watching too. Also if you've ever wondered if your husband would like to be stripped for they even interview husbands to get their opinions. It might be a fun gift for a wedding shower or bachelorette party for the wife to be. However this video is not fluffy - and don't expect soft porn - this is not that kind of video - put it in the self-help category. Basically the theme is: put a new flame in your marriage play..."
4,Two Biskups,"An inspiration, the only problem being that 100 is far too small a number. So here I am waiting for the 500"
2,"Great restoration, lousy packaging","The restoration work on the movies is extraordinary. What is not is extraordinary is the packaging of the movies. Why are all the movies randomly put together?These DVD come in a wafer thin cases popular now, the individual dvd booklets do not fit in the DVD case. Instead they fit loosely in the collection's box.On the whole the collection feels cheap, its not but it feels that way. The DVDs are a great improvement over the last release, but the Bond bootleg DVDs that flooded the marked last year had better overall quality and packaging. Even the art work on these DVDs appear amateurish.What is most disappointing is there is no way to display the collection. After seeing the UK release of the collection the American DVD collection is major let down."
2,James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 2,"3 of 4 DVD I watched, fail at about 60 minutes from start.The DVD player got frozen. I tried it several times.I also tried to watch these DVDs the comuter, a Sammsung, and a Olidata Laptop.Same problem, or worst, could not even start to see the film.¿can be the Region or Area issue?"
4,James Bond Collection,Bought this pack and received it before the said delivery time. It is always nice to get things before the time and not late .. :-)
3,Watch out if you order whole series,"I ordered all 4 of these box sets recently from Amazon during one of their sales. There's nothing wrong with these discs if you get a good copy. But two of my sets were tainted with a defective disc - movie disc (haven't watched any of the bonus discs). I guess I should have done ""20 Days of 007"" like TBS used to do years back when there was only 14 or so movies. Bottom line is that if you order these, watch them quickly to be sure you don't have any defective discs and miss Amazon's short no-charge return window. I'm giving Amazon 3 stars, not the movies. I'd give the movies 5 stars."
4,James Bond Ultimate Collection Vol # 2,Just bought the James Bond Ultimate Collection Volume 2. got the best price and it shipped out quickly.
4,"Great DVDs, not-so-great packaging","The DVDs themselves are great, as are all Bond movies. The Bond volumes each contain 10 DVDs (2 discs per movie for film and special features and 5 movies per set) and 5 little booklets about each movie. These booklets tell you about the general filming/production experiences. They are fun reads. However, the cases in which each DVD is packaged are not that high of quality. So far, I have volumes 1 and 2, and the cases for 2 of the 10 movies have broken little pegs that hold the DVD in place.The pegs that hold the DVD in place seem to be slightly too big. The DVD does not come out easily, so you have to really push on the pegs or really pull on the DVD, both of which can break the pegs.But don't let that stop you from purchsing the sets because they truly are great box sets."
5,"Bond, James Bond","Excellent collection but the extras are very cool. If you like the 60's and 70's with all their Bond mania, this collection will provide some excellent films and some revealing extras."
5,This book works,"This book does a wonderful job of teaching shapes. Each page introduces a new shape playing in the park, while all the other shapes are having fun in the background. All the shapes are different colors, have rhyming names, and are busy doing different activities. Therefore this book not only teaches the names of shapes, but colors and actions as well."
3,my daugher does not like it,"this book looks fine to me, but somehow, my daughter does not have any interest in it, although she likes to read"
5,A Nice Piece!,"A great little necklace. The chain is quality, the oval small, (a little smaller than I'd imagined) but classy. Not at all cheap. Came quite knotted tangled, but that is apt to happen when shipped loose. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this piece! It goes with everything. :)"
4,Very nice,"This is a cute necklace, smaller that I pictured it, but still nice. I purchased it as a gift for a friend, but because of the size, I will give it to my 14 year old cousin instead. It is a nice piece of jewelry and will be a good size for her, not too large for someone her age. I like the current trend of looping the necklace directly around the pendant."
1,Time Loosing,Don't loose your time for reading this book. Personally I didn't expect a book from Mr.Abidi and Mr.Gray. No given theory and nopractice. Only some old IEEE papers collections .Such a pitty..
2,"DUDE-ikoff is back, but this time he ain't no ninja","For some reason I have to watch any movie that stars Michael DUDE-ikoff, especially if the film was produced by the notorious B-action Cannon Films corporation. This time the dude is in the middle east taking on terrorists and corrupt oil company big-wigs. At first glance this reminded my of the hilarious Steven Seagal film On Deadly Ground, but give me DUDE-ikoff anyday over Seagal.This movie was made towards the end of the Cannon Films legacy and I don't think the company had a lot of money to spend, and it shows. The production values is of considerably less than their classic 80's films such as American Ninja and Invasion U.S.A., however it still comes off to be a fun NO-brain action flick with Dudikoff giving another hilarious, almost drugged performance. For fans of Cannon or B-Action flicks, this is a must. Just don't expect a steller presentation on DVD as the DVD is as basic as you can get. Full screen and NO special features."
3,the story could have been better.,"this film shows more of Michael Dudikoff's acting ability, but that's about it. and some of the humor was okay. someone should give Dudikoff a chance at A type movies."
2,Kill the writer!,"Found only two things good about movie: 1) More lines for Michael Dudikoff=more chances to show he's a good actor (better than Jean-Claude). 2) Decent supporting cast. The writer should be shot. The only way to believe this garbage of a script is to be a 5 year old child. Too many action movie cliches. What was Ross' nemesis wearing? It looked like a wig. And yes, I'm sure everyone will believe that one man in the open can shoot all the personnel at the refinery with a few clips and an AK-47 while they shoot at him from cover and he doesn't even bother to duck (not that it matters, he doesn't get hit anyway). Bottom line: acting was great, script sucked so bad you'd have to be a moron to enjoy the movie. You can almost see the actors saying, ""this script's the rough draft right?"""
5,The Bard for All Occasions,"Tom Leech's book, ""Say It Like Shakespeare"" is an absolute gem - and definitely a keeper. In the short time in which I've owned the book, I have used it in lectures, classes, and even social occasions. Surely Shakespeare himself must be delighted to know his words ring true for so many instances in this 21st century. This wonderful book shall have a place of honor among the reference books I use most often. However, this is the only one that continually amuses, confounds, and inspires. I certainly hope that Mr. Leech will soon be publishing more."
4,Interesting Ideas,"This book gave a lot of interesting ways to use plants that I had never thougt to use before. These recipes are great, I especially love the wild mint sauce and the pink clover vinaigrette. I was hoping there would be more recipes for seeds and common weeds and their leaves, but it was a good buy."
3,"Pretty, interesting, but don't stay in very well","Could just be my ears *shrug* Love the jewelry though, and didn't consider the difficulty I had keeping them in in my review score."
1,Cheap Presentation,"The mirror is very small, smaller than it looks in the picture. I bought 3 as bridesmaid gifts. Instead of arriving in nice velvet presentation bags like every jewelry/accessory item I've ever purchased, they arrived in black linty felt bags which looked very badly hand-sewn. The bags are open at the end (no draw-string closure) so the mirror will slide right out and thus float around in your purse getting scratched. I am too embarrassed to give these as gifts as they are, so I'll now have to go buy velvet bags to put them in. I called HansonEllis to complain and give them a chance to fix it, and they couldn't have cared less. Ladies, if you are thinking of giving these as bridal gifts, I would choose another product from another vendor. I was attracted by the ""too good to be real"" price and was very disappointed."
5,As simple as it gets!,"Install was a breeze, and only took about 10 minutes. All the hardware was included and the instructions were clear. Fitment was right on!"
5,Hoistgrace,"This is the very first time I voluntarily picked up a history book for casual reading. This book helped me break new ground in my life! I recommend this book not just because Washington is a fascinating individual but because the way Flexner writes might make one think he knew Washington personally! Its just amazing. If you aren't a ""history person"" like me, you'll still find this book educational and entertaining."
4,VERY GOOD !,"Inside this series approach, this book is very good. Chris THomas did a marvellous job. I only missed an explanation for tha confirmed kills of Pierre CLostermann who, in his book ""THE BIG SHOW"", tells that he has 33 victories, but RAF only gives him 11 (a very wide gap! )"
2,Bacchus falls off the donkey,"The Molesworth books have made many in my family into firm Ronald Searle fans. Of course, we are shameless anglophiles, and probably most people would find Molesworth much less funny than we do. Anyhow, outside the relatively innocent confines of St. Custard's, Mr. Searle can get too raunchy for my taste. Winespeak is a good example of this. Well, there's ""wicked"" right in the title, so I was just dumb to order it."
3,Biosilk Finishing Spray,"What I ordered and what I received were two different products. I ordered Biosilk Finishing Spray Firm Hold - Hair Spray and received CHI Flex Hold Firm Hold Hair Spray. I chose not to return the product received because I thought I might as well try it, the price paid ended up a great sale for the amount of hair spray in the can. The CHI Flex Hold Hair Spray does not hold the hair style for as long a period of time as the Biosilk Firm Hold. I should have made contact with the seller to see why the product was switched or if the other product was no longer being manufactured. I will still make future purchases from Amazon.com and possibly this seller."
1,Biosilk Finishing Spray,I had no idea that it was an aerosol. I would like to return it. How do I return it?
5,Love this show,I really love this show and love having it available in full HD whenever the mood strikes. I recommend this to any fan of the show
1,Lots of quotes,Got the CD -was very excited... But got the history of evolving philosophy with no origInal thought but about 30 quotes per minute-- citing this or that great thinker... As if to qualify the validity of the content-- but the content was that ... Quotes and more quotes.It was good only to point me to listen to other great thinkers and as a research article.Not worth full price-- perhaps 50%.
4,Don't comment on things you wouldn't understand,"listen people... i know you're all hurt because of September 11, we all feel with you we really do... but that's no reason for you to go judging the middle eastern culture as the weak link in the evolutionary process... if you've read the Cilistine Prophesy you'd understand that we are much better at the 8th insight than you'll ever be because we promote familly values and raising our children in the best atmosphere we could provide (though that could be a bit hard at present times)... all i'm saying is don't go generalizing about things you've never experienced... all you probably know is what you see on television and believe me that's only a fraction of the middle east! we know ourselves... do you?Labib from the middle east"
2,Gentle and simplistic,"While the topic and content of this book seems interesting atfirst, the authors have presented the material in such a simpleway that it looks like if human evolution was so obvious andlinear. Most of the examples and works that support the viewpointof the authors seem to me quite ok, but the authors probably didnot read them thoroughly because they left much of their depthuntouched. What this book provides is merely inconsistent andunexplained information about aspects of humanity that are betterdiscussed elsewhere. So the value of reading this book might beto get you frustrated and make you go to the references of thebook, to get the original sources of the material of the book intheir full depth. But at least reading it from cover to coverwill not cost you much intellectual effort..."
3,"Broad strokes, yet elegant in it's content","The authors did a fine job delivering a readable, informative book with a reasonable degree of perspicuity. To be sure, they painted wide swaths through a great deal of topics rendering limited, but sufficient detail, so as to pique the interest of emerging truth seekers. All pretentiousness aside, this is a simple yet wonderful ""Wow, God-Does-Amazing-and-Mysterious-Things"" style of book; written I think for the very beginning student of truth. Mind you, in the last two years I have read well over 100 books on the subjects of science/spirituality and the conflation thereof; so there was nothing new in this piece for me. As well - the book is rather dated, but it is a nice place to start.3 stars on the board 3 and for a real score from me today."
1,A disappointing metaphysical book!,"If you've been involved in consciousness growth for over ten minutes this book is GREATLY DISAPPOINTING. If you've been absent for the last 20 years you might find it useful.Where's the passion? Where is the new direction? Where's the meat? We are so ready for going ahead in new areas and doing it quickly -- particularly since 9/11 -- that these two giants of metaphysics have left us cold and looking elsewhere.I'm sorry guys (and lady) this isn't the book we were all expecting from you. It might make a great textbook for a beginning class, but its too long, too detailed, too much history and too dry.We hope you try again because we still love you!"
5,One of My All-Time Favorite Books,"If you're a fan of Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassidy, it will take you a few pages to get into this book.Carolyn's writing style is reserved and personal, but the more you read the book, the more you'll appreciate her simple ""just the facts"" way of sharing her experiences with the gang.There is no bitterness, no bad-mouthing, but also she doesn't spare some of the less flattering aspects of the spectacularly unique people and times she once knew.This is one of those rare gems where, upon reading the last page of the book, all you want to do is read some more."
1,"Why don't you whine a little more, Carolyn?","I read near-obsessively, and this is one of the few books from the past four years that I've started and not been able to finish.When Carolyn Cassady isn't attempting to elicit readers' sympathy for her as the poor, neglected wife of beat luminary Neil Cassady, she's trying to claim that Neil's genius excuses said neglect. Ultimately, neither pity nor admiration for Carolyn is possible.I still can't decide whether Carolyn Cassady is simply pathetic or simply trying to cash in on her husband's fame."
4,Worth a look,"This book has very good summaries of psychological research on the issues of power and control. It would be a particularly helpful book for a student writing a paper in an undergraduate class. The book is not hard to read; I finished it in 2 days. I found her chapters on romantic relationships, parenting and work relationships helpful and gained insight into my own behaviour."
3,Not Up To Expectations,"I read "" Necessary Losses""and I thought this book would be its equal or better. Like most sequels, though, it falls short of the mark and left me wanting. I kept thinking, "" ... and the point is?"" The book is probably OK if you haven't read the first one. Otherwise, read the children's books."
4,I am a little bit biased,"I have to confess, I have the original accounts referred to in this book, both the principal work and the ancillary books. And I have read Mr. Williams book on the Great South Sea. He is somewhat scholastic and his scholarship gets in the way of the story a bit, but what a story ! We have never known the thrill that these adventurers experienced, the fears, the unknown, the injury and death. We just do not know their world. It's a great book of a great adventure. I thank Mr. Williams for it."
4,A good book for fully understanding of PL/SQL,"I have Sybex and this one. I like this one because it has a lot of exercises. After I pass the examination, I can have confidence to handle the job which is given by my boss."
3,Nothing but issues,"The finger board is askew slightly. This made the bridge placement tricky.Two strings were next to impossible to string, one of which broke upon tuning.The bow seems excellent. The body of the violin is beautiful. The tailpiece is fine.We have yet to play this instrument. I will edit this after the violin is repaired with the cost of repair and rate the sound it produces."
5,A Simply Great Book.,"The book was great, I enjoyed every minute of it. I couldn't put it down, I was reading while eating dinner, washing clothes, and in between housework. It held my interest, wanting to know what was going to happen next with the storyline. I read romance novels all the time, some you start and it doesn't quite grab your interest and you put it down and maybe you will get back to it, this book as soon as I picked it up it grabbed my interest. I can't wait till her next book."
5,Memories!!,"Fond childhood memories came to mind when reading ""With the Stroke of the Pen."" The story line was so beautiful I stayed up till the wee hours of the morning so I could finish it. Her descriptions of the period truly took me home to my parent's small town restaurant which included a soda fountain and where the school kids came for lunch and after school. I although I was under 6 years old at the time, I vividly remember ""Senior Day"" when all the graduates got a free treat. Can you imagine ice cream sodas being $.20, sundaes were $.25 and bananna splits were a real luxury costing $.35!!This is the only book I've ever wanted to keep. It will be placed with special keepsakes for my grandchildren with the notation, ""This book gives a great description what life was like when Oma was a child."""
2,"Potentially useful, disappointingly bias","Marc Gopin made an attempt at an unbiased, all-encompassing handbook for religious peace-making... And unfortuanately fell into the same trap as scholars on religion and war, or religion and peace, have for centuries. The lack of eidetic vision (ability to see things as a whole) and epoché (suspension of judgement) make this book disappointingly bias.Nonetheless, if one can disregard the majority of the book (which fall into aforementioned trap), there are one or two gems of useful information, although anyone intending to use the framework for religious peacemaking as proposed in the book should be very aware of the implications such a subjective view has."
4,A Christmas Story meets Die Hard as potentially conceived by David Lynch,Dark humor. Really dark humor. So dark some won't even recognize it as humor. Plus a child action hero. And Santa Clause. And elves. And the triumphant capitalist exploitation of a downtrodden minority.
4,Not for Children,"A deliciously creepy, quirky movie, based on pre-Coke stories about Santa. Definitely not for young believers, but fun for a mature audience."
4,Rare Exports A Christmas Tale,A weird movie... SCFIers will love it. A weird movie... SCFIers will love it. A weird movie... SCFIers will love it.
4,Something different,"I ordered this after hearing a very positive review on NPR and thought it would provide a good chance to gather our teenage kids for a hopefully offbeat holiday movie. We were not disappointed, although we never really got why it was described in some quarters as a comedy. Yes, it was ""funny"", but only in the same way a dream is when you try to tell it to someone after the fact and realize that what made sense while it was occuring now sounds completely ridiculous."
4,A Rare Treat,"An atmospheric story with a sly take on the mythology surrounding Santa Claus and his elves. More creepy and intriguing than actually scary. the movie is based on a 2003 film short and follows the impact on a rural Finnish community when a billionaire has a team of miners burrow into the ""largest burial mound in the world.""A little uneven as the film struggles unsuccessfuly to straddle the line between a horror film and the parody short that it was based on, the movie is ultimately worth the time spent viewing it."
4,Finnish fantasy,Well made fantasy/dark comedy in true finnish style. The 2003 and 2005 shorts made to obtain the funding for this movie are true comedic gems and really need to be seen in order to appreciate the Finns sense of humor. Little blood and no horror. You are buying for the beautiful scenery and a taste of nordic humor.
5,Not your normal Christmas Story.,"First I saw the trailer. Then, I saw the movie in the theater. Then, I joyfully bought the Blue Ray/DVD, which comes with both Blue Ray and a regular DVD, which I gave to a good friend of mine from Finland.Rare Exports is a rather tense thriller/black comedy. I wouldn't recommend for children even though the movie has brilliant child actors in it. The cool thing about this film is that it wipes away the gloss and pizzazz of today's Coca-Cola Santa, and brings back the true meaning of ""..you better watch out, you better not cry..."". At first I was apprehensive about watching a foreign film, but after a few minutes I found reading the subtitles easy because there wasn't that much to read. A lot of action takes place with suggestion at every corner. I hate to give away any spoilers, except that you will love this cult classic and beware of shopping mall Santa's.Thank you Amazon for shipping it quickly!"
5,Best Movie I've seen all YEAR!,"This and Trollhunter have been my favorite movies all year. This one beats out Trollhunter by just a smidge, because the ending is better (great!) and the colors/camera work are awesome. Original story, with suspense, humor and characters you really adore. Great +"
3,"Starts out great, then slides","At least the first half of this movie--and maybe a little more--is excellent. Dark, different, and kind of creepy. Suspense builds around one of the best villains in a long time. Never has a skinny old man created such dread. But the movie loses its way in the second half, and especially towards the end. One character suddenly develops sacrificial, heroic, leadership qualities, for no obvious reason whatsoever. Then the movie ends too simply and too suddenly. An epilogue is tacked on that I think was supposed to be funny. Not too, and kind of bizarre. See it for the first hour though."
2,Not what you think,"The trailer and the summary of this movie is a bit misleading. It's pretty boring and the kid's character is mopey and annoying.*****Spoiler Alert*****You think they're going to unearth Santa and he's going to be terrifying. Well, they do eventually find Santa, but they never show him (probably for budget reasons). The scary guy with the beard is just an elf, one of many as a matter of fact. And they don't do anything useful in the movie, except run around naked. The movie seems to be leading up to the culmination of all the events, but there's no Santa reveal and the big ""showdown"" consists of a boring helicopter scene where it flies a few miles luring the elves into a pen. Then, apparently the people box up the elves and sell them to people. But they sell them as Santa Clauses, so that makes no sense. And that's all."
4,Great but Too Big for Carry-Around,"It's a great piece, but it's not comfortable to carry-around. The pages are a little thing, but it works as a great composite piece. As a whole, It's great. However, If you're looking for individual pieces, get the individual plays."
5,Great Buy!,"A perfect collection of the bard's entire works! With good formatting that is lends itself to easy reading, your eyes will never tire of Elizabethan english again! A must for the lover of Master Shakespeare, or a perfect and indomitable addition to any bookshelf. Impress your friends and impress your mind! Nifty slipcase for the hardy reader and sumptuous red hard cover dictates a sylish and subtle treatment of the text that ensures return reading again and again and with editor Stephen Greenblatt at the helm this Norton Edition is at the peak of academic scrutiny and reputation. Great playwright. Great editors. GREAT BUY!"
5,The Norton Shakespeare,"It is excellent and much better than the Riverside, because the short phrase annotations are on the same line. You don't have to scan down looking for the translation unless it is a lengthy one."
4,No complaints about the content…,"I've got no quarrel with the content. But the format of this single volume edition is difficult to use. The pages are onion-skin so there is some bleed through of the opposite page. Worse, the book doesn't lay flat and the contents curve towards the spine where it is very difficult to read. This is a case where a larger page width would have helped by allowing a more generous inner margin.If you struggle with this and twist and bend the book, you'll find excellent introductions and explanatory material. I'd like to see these plays released in individual titles with a better margin and thicker paper."
4,Norton's Legacy - Getting Money Out of College Kids' Parents,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
5,Norton Shakespeare,I received the Norton Shakespeare very soon after ordering it via amazon. The book is in perfect condition! Overall I'm very satisfied with the company I ordered it from and it was essentially half the price that it was at my campus bookstore :-)
2,TOO HEAVY!!!,"Perhaps it is because I don't really like Shakespeare and took this class, but this book is just too long. It should have been broken up in to several volumes instead of jammed together in this 15 pound monstrosity that makes even reading it awkward at best. The best part? This is assigned to students who have to lug it around all day long. So, students, if you are assigned this book, I recommend going to class the first day, getting your syllabus and buying each individual play. Most sonnets you can find free online.If you aren't a student and are buying this for fun, even if you like Shakespeare, this book just takes up a ton of space that isn't worth it AT ALL!If you are an instructor thinking of assigning this book... I implore you, think of your poor students and just let them buy Hamlet....or at least the Sparknotes."
5,Very Interesting Exercise DVD,"I began Yoga only a few months ago and have about 5 other DVD's and decided to order this one. I am very pleased with my purchase..the instructor has a very relaxing voice and she tells you how and when to draw in a breath and then let it out.Her exercises are kind of challenging to the novice but I found that I could bend in position quite easily. (I'm not very limber to say the least!). At the end of the workout, I felt like I had actually done something and would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get into Yoga, even a beginner. I want to purchase her other DVD's as well!!! You won't be sorry!"
3,Good way to assess students reading,Very good book. The included CD/DVD and student book are wonderful. Very good to assess reading in all grades. Highly recommend this book.
1,Disgusted with any-book!,"I ordered this resource for a school division TWICE, both times I was sent a used product when I ordered new, it was also missing the CD and the resource was the wrong edition. This happened twice on two seperate orders."
3,edited review,"Ok, my initial review of the product was harsh as I had no noticeable changes.However, I did continue using the product and have seen a little bit of a change.I must note, I do not use this alone..I use other brightening products, facial washes and toners. Just a note, before applying the mask, I make sure to wash my face thoroughly, follow up with a toner..and then apply the mask for about 10 minutes.Ill keep using it..a little goes a long way. If I continue to notice results, I may purchase again."
1,i wouldn't buy it ...,"I've been through about 3 of these. They all seem to share a common design fault of draining the battery in 1-2 months.Other than that, they work just fine:-(I am evaluating wall controls from other manufacturers that:1. Communicates to the UC7067 receiver usually used in these ceiling fans2. Uses wall voltage instead of batteries.Looks like Monte Carlo doesn't make any that meet these requirements.mlloyd1"
2,"Toys, not Drums","If I had been able to see these in a store first, I would not have choosen them. The top ""skin"" is very thin. Sound is horrible. These are toys, not drums. OK for toddlers, preschool only."
5,The tops in Barbecue covers.,"This is a top of the range cover, well made, tough material, and is good looking too. I recommend, without reservation."
4,Grill cover,This cover provides the coverage and protection for which it stated it would and is easy to use--so far. It has not yet been through a midwest winter so I guess time will tell.
5,highly recommend,The product is what we expected and works well. We have many dust and wind storms and it stays put. Looks good too. Highly recommend.
2,"Not sized correctly, Size way up.","This is a heavy cover that did NOT fit my 68-inch bbq propane cart. I carefully measured it and wanted a fairly tight fit as we live in a high wind area and a lighter and looser cover kept flying off and ending up in a neighbor's yard. The only thing I can attribute the poor fit to is inferior measuring during production. What a hassle to have to return it and wait for deliver of the XXL which is labeled ""up to 72 inches."" That fits but not well. This is not US made.The material is heavy, though, which is why I've given it two stars. Much better quality than you'll find in the big box stores, though."
1,Grill cover does not fit!!!,"I was advised by Amazon to order this cover together with the Char Broil K6B 6-Burner 65,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburner. I did not hesitate to order the cover as the Amazon site advised to order it with the grill. I am very dissapointed now that is does not fit!"
1,BBQ cover,"Unfortunately, this cover was not as large as indicated on the description. It said up to 72"", in reality it was only 70"" and too small for our 72"" grill. Description should be changed to coorespond with box. We were disappointed because the cover was a very nice quality."
3,"Good Quality, but does not look very attractive",I bought this for our Weber Genesis grill based on user reviews.The XXL covers the grill perfectly and seems very durable. But the color doesn't match the rest of the furnitures and looks unattractive on the deck. I wish it comes in other colors.
3,"So far, so good.","Fair price, quick shipment, item in good shape. Fits the grill nicely and looks good. Let's see how it holds up over this winter and several summer-winter cycles. So far, so good."
5,excellent grill cover,"This is a great grill cover in that it is heavy, good quality and fits our grill and stays in place with our winds. Would definitely recommend this product."
5,"Classic Accessories Medium 58"" Grill Cover","Got this yesterday for my Weber Genesis E-310 LP Grill (2012 Model). Cover fits like a glove; like it was custom made for the Weber. Was concerned because Weber lists dimensions for the Genesis E-310 as larger than Classic lists the size of this cover. Thought it might not fit but after reading other reviews that said it fit their Weber Genesis E-310 grills like a glove I thought I would give it a try. It fits great! The handles on each side make it easier to put on and take off. The vents are covered which helps to keep water out. Don't know if the cover itself is waterproof or not but it is a heavy fabric and seems to be stitched very well. Color scheme is also nice. Will have to see how well it holds up over time. Overall it seems like a winner at a very, very good price at about $20 less than the Weber Black cover. Just hoping the fabric can handle the rain."
2,UPDATE: Item ripped bad after 9 months.,"Fits the webber perfect. I bought the Webber cover and as I was putting it on, I noticed pin holes in the plastic. It wouldn't have lasted a week and it would have leaked. I returned it... I was lucky I didn't rip it when I took it off the grill. This cover is about 5 times thicker, easy.UPDATE: Item ripped... the heavy fabric dried out and ripped. If you have other options, use them. This worked well at first. Bad material."
5,Finally a cover that doesn't blow away,"Great water resistance, quality stitching and construction. I ordered the next size up for extra coverage of my BBQ but probably unnecessary for most people. The tie feature is very useful as there is no way this will blow off in the wind. Just had winds up to 160 Km/h and the cover hardly even moved!!!"
5,Heavy Duty,This cover is heavy duty. No cheap stuff here! Fits my Weber Summit 470 like a glove. I'm glad I purchased this cover and I believe it will last as long as my Weber does.
4,"Veranda BBQ cover, large","Just received the new cover, workmanship is fine and this material will remain flexible in the winter. I guess the only advantage the old hard plastic type material was in the winter and I took it off, I could let it stand upright on the deck by itself. The Veranda fits and forms around my Weber with a side burner very well (my grill measures 48-tall, 19-deep, and 63-wide), the large fit just fine.I am so pleased that once I find out my friends grill size, I am ordering one for him and his wife.I also saved my old black cover which leaked and was hard to handle for an under cover of the Veranda unit for the severe winters although I try to cook out year round.Good product."
2,"Disappointed, ripped after one season","After reading mostly positive reviews I purchased this cover and bragged to friends about how durable it was and how it was going to last. I have to admit that upon recieving it I agreed with the reviews. However, going into my second winter (I have owned it for just 1 yr) I can tell it will need to be replaced next year. Three of the four corners have rips of about 3-4 inches wide. I have re-sewn the corners 3 times and even used duct tape to help keep the corners together. If you live in a place with little wind or have great protection from the elements you should be in great shape with this cover. If however you are from the mid-west I suggest lookign elsewhere or planning to re-purchase every year or so.With the price currently at $29 I am feeling a little bit harsh with two stars. That said if you can get this for $29 or less I would probably rate it a 3 star as I wouldn't expect a cover to last much longer than 1-2 years for that price."
4,Good Value,"This is my second order for this cover, which is very good and the price is reasonable. However, I ordered this cover before and due to harsh winters where the elements, particularly extreme cold temperatures, snow and ice decreases the life of the cover, which suffered tears and cracks."
5,Great Grill Cover,I've had this cover for over a year now and it still looks like new. Even though a rough winter.It was better than I expected and looks like it was made for my Weber Grill.I highly recommend this & I believe it will last a very very long time.
4,Great cover,"This cover is the second one we've had. The first one finally deteriorated and fell apart. Not complaining, it survived the tough Kansas weather for 4 years. This one was much cheaper than the last one we bought."
5,looks great,"I am not gonna lie, I bought this cover for my husband's grill because I was bothered by how dirty it would get. I bought it for the looks. And it trully looks great! But overall I am very happy with this purchase. It's a prefect size, it's easy to clean with just a damp rag and best of all, my husband actually does cover the grill again after use. That means he must like it too. :)"
3,good looking cover,Showed up quickly. Looks nice. Fits perfectly on my Weber Genesis grill. Call me in 2 years to see how it holds up.
4,solid BBQ Cover,It arrived in good time and is very solid and durable so far. It has multiple strings to pull it tight in all the right locations
4,Good Long Term Weather Resistance,I purchased this cover over two years ago and it still is in excellent condition. It is fully exposed to weather and sun 24/7. Other less expensive covers I have purchased in the past became brittle and started falling apart after two years of weather exposure. It is a perfect fit on a Weber 320 Genesis gas grill.
4,Good Cover,Looks like I will be able to get a few years out of this cover. Had it for a few months and still holding up well. Didn't even need to buckle the latches during Sandy.
5,Better than expected,"I was very pleased with the quality of the fabric,it was much heavier than I had expected. The size was a perfect fit, very generous..Color was good,and as described,it has the loops to secure it at the wheels.Excellent value!"
5,Excellent product,"I purchased a Weber BBQ cover, and it only lasted two years before it started cracking. The material on this cover is much thicker, and I expect it will last much longer."
4,Great for the $,"This cover is a bit stiff, but should be OK after time on the grill. Very well constructed and heavy duty. I would certainly buy it again, but probably won't need to."
4,Great product,Gave this as a gift and they really like it. They said it fit the grill perfectly and protects it well from the elements.
5,The far better choice for covering the Weber Genesis,"Lots of details, including large zipper pocket, wind stays, and protective flaps over vents. Easy on/off using cloth handles. The large is large but fits the Genesis neatly. Some on this site say the medium is a bit more tailored and even better fit. The neutral color is great and although only purchased this season so far all the stitching seems to be holding up just fine. No need to pay nearly double for other covers."
5,Great Cover!,"I bought a Weber EP310 gas grill but did not buy their cover, due to the bad reviews I had heard about them. I looked at the Verandas and thought I would give them a try and glad that I did. I purchased the medium cover and what a fit on my EP310. Fits like a glove. Some reviews said to buy the large and some said the medium, I am glad that I went with the medium. Great cover, heavy duty and very good quality."
4,Good material,It is classic and nice looking grill cover. Waterproof and easy to clean.It does fit perfectly for my grill that it has about 56 Inch for the widest part.
3,Lasts about 3 years.,"This is our second one of these bbq covers in 6 years, the first one lasted about 3 years before it fell apart. In all fairness we live in extreme heat in the summer so nothing lasts out there without fading and eventually falling apart. This cover did fade and fall apart but I think it was still good value for the 3 years use we got out of it. Nice looking cover and I like the way it secures at the bottom."
1,"Looks Nice, but...","The cover looks nice, but it lasted less than one season. It's supposed to cover your grill while it's outside. However, the issue is it being OUTSIDE. It doesn't stand up to the elements at all and will eventually rot and rip apart. So, my search still continues for a cover that will stand up to the elements and not become shredded crap in less than a season."
2,"Great at first, only made it 18 months.","I purchase the grill cover in Nov 10. The cover had a lot of great features (the handles, the vent, good looking, the tie downs) and for the first year I was really impressed with it. However, starting late last year, I noticed the color fading really bad. When I flipped the inside out, the bottom color with drastically lighter. It does get the morning and afternoon sun, so some of this is to be expected, but it is a lot more then my neighbors similarly color toned cover that receives similar exposure. Now, the fabric is ripped at the seams right by the handles that are used to remove it. I understand that grill covers arent going to last forever, but I am less then satisfied that one and half summers of use is all I get out of it.Pros:Great looking designVent holeBuckle straps for windy daysHandles to remove coverCons:Color faded quicklyFabric ripped at seams by handle"
4,Awesome Grill Cover,"I purchased this cover after my old one blew away. I really liked the old one but I live on Lake Erie and we get extreme winds. This tent is very heavy duty. I bought the XL. After the first rain, I pulled the cover and there was definitely some moisture under it, but not horrible. After that I decided to spray it with camp dry and now I have no issues at all with it. I really like the snap together buckles at the bottom of it. I can buckle all four legs and it's not going anywhere."
4,Almost custom made,"Excellent quality, very good fit for an off-brand BBQ (Nexgrill Model #720-0617). A little short in height. But overall, I couldn't ask for a better match."
5,A very nice cover,"I tried several BBQ covers and this was the best by far. My BBQ is 60"" wide and this cover fit well and seems very durable."
3,Very nice cover...,"This cover is exactly what we were hoping it would be. It's heavy, sturdy and has a nice look and feel to it. It fits our Kenmore 4 burner 58"" grill perfectly. The straps on bottom are useless for me, because the base of our grill is enclosed with no available ""Leg"" to attach them to, but the bungee cord has proved more than sufficient.Edit 12/12/12: I've had this cover for well over a year now. Although it is still in one piece and doesn't appear to be leaking, I am disappointed by the moldy water streaks that have formed. They're black and very obvious on the cover. Also, the cover has become very, very stiff and is more difficult to get on and off. Despite these issues, it's still a good cover and does what it says it will. I would probably buy again, though I'd try to find this cover in black!"
5,"Believe the great reviews, don't waste $ on other covers","The Healthy Skeptic just received this grill cover and I must say it's excellent! The material is heavy weight, with rubber backing so it's very sturdy and heavy enough to protect and stay put in a wind. The clips can secure to the grill so the cover will NOT blow off. The air vents at the top really are important to let the moisture evaporate the vents (simple but effective to keep out rain, but mesh under the flap allows breeze to dry).Had my grill for 15 years so I want a cover that will last and do it's job nicely. All looks good for this cover as I just keep replacing burners on my grill and fill the propane tank. If you are going to buy a good ""keeper"" grill, this cover will protect your investment. What an amazing price as we've bought several other ""deluxe"" covers over the years that can't weather the tough winter of Northern Minnesota. Buy this one, don't waste money on ones that cost 2-3x more!"
5,Veranda Grill cover,"I purchased two of these last month. My wife and I absolutely love them so far and the price was very reasonable, especially for the quality. Seems like they thought of everything, from the sewn in handles to assist in removing, the pocket for grilling tools, to the drawstring and clips to securely fasten it to your grill."
5,Great Cover!,"I bought this for my dad in size Large hoping it would fit- and it did, perfectly! Great looking, durable and good price for the quality."
3,Color not a match to previous purchase,"I bought this cover to match a table cover we purchased previously. Although the color name is the same, the colors of the fabrics are not even close. The cover is well made and fits perfectly. It would be nicer if the color had been a match."
2,Lasted (1) year - ripped apart when removed for grilling.,Nice looking. Received for Father's day. Covered with mold after 6 - 9 months - apparently not coated. Just ripped like tissue paper as I was uncovering the grill. Threw out. But if you want a good looking cover for 6 months. Otherwise do nto buy.
4,"so far, so good","Nice, quality product. I think that it will last because the material is more like canvas and less like plastic. I don't expect that it will crack like all my other ones did!"
4,BBQ cover,Ours had just worn out from being in the weather too long so this was perfect for our needs. Fits very well and does the job we wanted it to do
4,Works like it should,"Just make sure you get the right size and you'll be set. There is nothing too amazing about this BBQ cover, but it does the job exactly as it should and feels high quality."
4,Heavy duty and fits well,I am using the medium size on a Weber Genesis E310 grill. Fits perfectly and I keep it on 365 days per year on my exposed deck here in MD. I am using this cover to replace the Weber #7553 which goes presently on amazon for $49.00 but is of lousy quality. Buy this one for your genesis lower price and not the Weber replacement cover.
2,Well made but....,"I purchased this item in May, 2011 and it worked well throughout the summer. However, when the late summer and fall rains began, I noticed that it mildewed on the plastic liner inside. I cleaned it off with a mixture of clorox and water, but with the heavy dews I know it will continue to mildew because it is damp inside every morning I have checked it. Sooooo, if you life in a dry place, this cover should be great. I'd avoid it if you live in a damp climate."
3,Only lasts a few years,"I really like this grill cover and its features. However, after using it for 2+ years now its starting todry-rot and tear...especially near the handles (I can no longer use them or it will tear even more).Granted...my grill sits out on a very sunny patio for 3 seasons but I would have thought that with the heavyweight of the material that it would last longer than it has. I would probably buy this again because I feel its a reasonable price for what you get, but don't expect too much durability over the years."
4,Excellent Quality,"I am completely satisfied with the material, color, width and depth of this product. The only disappointment is that it's about 2"" too short to meet the ground (purely an aesthetic issue) and my grill isn't set up right to make use of the leg velcro thingys. We have a CharBroil Red 3-burner.The draw string at the bottom is also a little difficult to use, but that's probably because the material is so heavy which I wouldn't trade for the world.Overall a great product that we will enjoy for many seasons!"
4,Have a 2010 WeberGenisisEP320? Get the medium cover,"We invested in our new & first Weber Genesis EP320 grill in October of 2010 as a replacement to a 10+ year old worn out Grillmaster Grill. Since our purchase last fall, the grill stayed in our garage and out of the New England elements (lots of snow this past winter and lots of rain this spring) until recently. When I purchased the grill, I didnt care for the OEM or big box stores grill covers i.e. price, quality, design, customer reviews, etc. I ordered this cover in a Medium and it's a perfect fit. It's much heavier quality than expected plus it has a three year warranty. As one reviewer already mentioned, the stiching could be better but its not horrible. We are happy with this product so far."
4,Nice cover,This cover is nice and heavy duty. It has 2 handles on the top so you can just grab each side of the cover and lift it off. It fits my webber spirt grill perfectly. The only drawback is that it will get dirty as it is pretty light colored and the grill will have some smoke residue that will rub off.
1,"After only six months, it has a hole in it.","After only six months, it has a hole in it. If it weren't for the hole, this product would be fine to use. Very disappointed. I need to figure out how to get a replacement, since there's a three year warranty."
5,Great Product!,"I have always had the basic grill covers, but this one is great! Very sturdy, well made and covers the grill perfectly."
5,Great Grill Cover For Weber Genesis S-330,"We just purchased a new Weber Genesis S-330 and this grill cover is a perfect fit! We used a Weber grill cover for our last weber and when I went on Amazon to look for a new cover for the new grill, I came upon this one. After looking at the reviews, I wasn't sure if the medium size would work---some reviewers suggested a large. I bought the MEDIUM and it fits perfectly!!The weber covers have sort of a mesh strip in the front and back, which can allow water in (which would happen after it rained). Now that this grill has the cabinets, this cover is a much better design so that water doesn't sit in the cabinet after a rain. The color of this cover is much nicer than a black weber cover too. I definitely recommend this!!"
5,Fit is true to size and it is FANTASTIC!,"Our grill sits outside all year. We live in Northern California, no snow but very windy and a winter full of cold rain. We were buying a new grill cover every six months. You know, the $22 black plastic tablecloth-like ones, with the white fuzz on the inside. The last one got its first rip in only two weeks!Finally, we got smart and purchased this ""Class Accessories 73922 Veranda Cart-Style Barbeque Cover"". Our BBQ measures 62 inches wide. We ordered the Large size of the cover, which the amazon page states is 64 inches wide. It fits our BBQ perfectly, not too big and not too tight, either. We live in a very windy area, so the ability to pull in the bottom hem a bit with the elastic cord is a big plus.We LOVE this sturdy and good looking cover. If we'd bought this two years ago, we would have saved ourselves some money!"
4,"Veranda Cart-Style Barbecue Cover, XXL","Product arrived quickly & was boxed well. It fits my Jenn-Air gas grill perfectly & it looks great. It is made of very heavy material, which suggests it will hold up well over time. The weight is probably what will surprise you the most. It may be difficult for some people to place on the grill. Another surprise is how many tie-downs it has - there are several ""click-close straps"" and two ""adjustable elastic hem cord with toggle,"" one at each end. It appears there are enough tie-downs to hold it in place during a hurricane! I only use the elastic cords at the ends, which is more than sufficient. The only other thing I can comment about is although it has some type of UV protective treatment applied to the fabric, it has faded noticably after only about 1 1/2 months. It's not terrible (yet), but I was surprised about how fast it happened. It's a nice, heavy-duty cover that's a great replacement for most grills."
4,Veranda BBQ Cover,"Great, heavy-duty cover! Did not give a 5 only because I had to send the first one back as the material did not catch in the seam line."
5,attractive and durable grill cover,"The fabric is very durable and is a attractive cover for the grill, it also has straps on it so the wind doesn't blow it off the grill."
5,Wow! Teriffic product!,I live in a windy spot and regularly replace grill covers as they get blown to shreds. This grill cover is super heavy duty. Straps at the bottom as well as a pull string to tighten it up. Fabric is sturdy and attractive. I checked the local garden centers before purchasing this product and did not find anything this nice.
5,Solid construction and great value!,"All I can say is ""Wow""! I was really surprised when I got this item in the mail. The quality material was heavy duty for the price that I paid. Somebody is doing good business in a time when so many of are use to ""you get what you pay for"". The last cover I got for my BBQ was from Lowes and it was about the same price but a cheap thin vinyl material that didn't last but a year. I expect this to last many years and definately feel like I got my money's worth! The product fit perfect and is so heavy that I don't even have to secure the pull cord at the bottom to keep it from flying away."
3,Slightly undersized for a medium,Covers the grill OK. Skirts are short & do not permit using the draw strings to tighten below the bottom of the grill. Tie loops are to short to be useful.
5,Just what we were looking for,"It's just what we were looking for: plenty big, heavy duty, well made, easy to take off and on. We recently had an amazing wind storm that raged all night, and I could imagine it blown into the neighbor's yard. What a relief to find it the next morning right where it belonged; you'd never have known to look at it that it had been windy at all! We're very pleased with it. It arrived very quickly and well packed, too."
4,hard to find quality BBQ cover,"I had a hard time replacing a friends BBQ cover that I had accidentally damaged.All my local hardware and patio furniture type stores only carried very flimsy and lightweight fabric,or those ugly black nylon/PVC covers.The texture and weight of these covers are very nice,and the price is reasonable.A very good find."
5,"Quality 70"" BBQ Cover","See the comment I added to my review after 2 & 1/2 years of use. I now recommend that your cover be at least 3"" longer than your grille.(Added 3-9-2012)<Original Posting>My grille is 69"" long by 24"" wide with the controls sticking out slightly more than 24"". The fit is good and can be tightened with an elastic cord that is in the bottom of the cover. If you tigten the elastic cord remember to loosen it before trying to remove the cover. I accidently pulled off the rubber part of the electronic igniter because I forgot to loosen the cord. It went right back on, but be carfull when pulling the cover off.I am very happy with the quality of the cover. I expect the cover to last at least 5 years. There are straps at the bottom to secure the cover to the casters. I think the grille would tip over before the cover would blow off if you put the straps around the casters.There is also a zippered pocket that could store grille utensils."
4,Excellent value,"This is a very good value for the cost, and it fits very well and protects the grill. I would nrecommend highly."
3,Revision of original review,"Very pleased with this. I've had it about two months now and it is simple to use and well designed overall. Features include buckles for all four legs of the BBQ, vents, handles on top, and hey, it's good looking too. I think it is money well spent.July 2, 2012:I demoted this from five stars to three because it ripped, big time ripped, right next to one of the top handles, a piece designed for some reason out of several sections. I believe ultimately it just didn't stand up to the sun so next time will look for something made from a Sunbrella material, if that even exists. For the money I expected at least two to three years just like a good car cover. The buckles were a good feature and saved it from blowing away in a couple of high wind storms."
5,Classic Accessories Grill Cover @ Amazon.com,Selected this cover because it was best match for a large BBQ grill. Had experienced problem with smaller size covers. Also liked the color and design. Received product promptly and on schedule. Fits excellent and was exactly as advertised.
5,Perfect Item,I received this yesterday and it was more than I expected. It is of high quality material and I also like the handles built into the top to help in putting on the cover as well as off. I also like the built in zipper pocket in the from or back (depending on which way you cover) It comes in handy....I am really pleased with this item as it reaches down to the bottom and has attachments to secure the bottom of the cover as well as a tightener on sides to give it a firm grip for storage in the winter ..Definitely the best cover I have ever bought.
5,Excellent Cover. Mine lasted for about 5 years.,"I got this soon after getting the Weber Genesis 310 grill. I got the large which fit a bit sloppy but did a good job. I just reorder and I am getting the medium and that should have less material touching the ground.The old one lasted about 5 years about 75% in direct sunlight and throw in rain, wind. The last few times I took it off, I noticed a white powder coming from the fabric. Also some of the plastic liner was cracking. A couple of days ago, the fabric just tore on top because it was very brittle.I am very satisfied as this costs only about $6 per year for outstanding protection. The BBQ looks almost new with no fading on the black. Overall, get this, you will be happy.PS I may try some armor all to protect from sunlight damage. But, 5 years is damn good!"
4,"Classic Accessories 73912 Veranda Cart-Style Barbecue Cover, Medium, 58 Inch","This is a Great grill cover, well made of quality materials and it fits my Weber genesis perfectly. The only thing I don't like is the color, I didn't think much about when I ordered it, but black is the best color for a grill cover, this cream and brown color shows dirt really well, no matter were I put it down on my deck when I take it off the grill it gets dirty and its going to look pretty crappy in no time. Its my mistake, after reading all the great reviews for this cover I had a senior moment on the color, and I bought it, other than that It's a great grill cover. By the way I'm keeping it, I'll review it again at the end of the season and let you know if it looks crappy or not, because no one else has mentioned anything about the color issues."
5,"Much Higher Than ""Average"" Quality","After noting the pricing of Weber Cover to protect my 5 year old Weber Grill, I shopped at well known Natl Discount store, and found cover for half the Weber price. Upon getting that one home, I viewed my options on Amazon, and found much heavier fabric and higher quality Cover for less than Weber, and slightly more than Natl. Discounter. I believe I've gotten the best product for the money. Plus, really looks great on my seasoned grill!"
5,finally a perfect cover,"after going through several grill covers over the past 15 years, this cover so far has been the best. As with all covers time will be the judge. I will come back later and post the progress. Based on material and design, which I feel I am a good judge of after all these years, I believe I have a winner.There are two handles to help you lift and position the cover in place over the grill. It may not sound like much but it is a nice feature. There is a draw cord at the bottom if you need to close the cover around the feet or wheels of your grill."
5,Generous fit! Heavy fabric,Generous fit! I don't like being forced to review in 18 words. I don't HAVE to respond to your request!
5,Totally Satisfied,"I found this cover to be a beautiful, heavy duty, great fitting addition to my grill. It is easy to remove and replace. We have had strong winds since I purchased it and it remained perfectly in place. I agree with the other 5 star ratings that convinced me to choose this one from Amazon.com."
5,"Wow, 1,000 reviews with 5 stars...now I know why","Just received my cover from Amazon and put it over my $2,500 grill and all I can say is, ""Wow!!"" This cover is hands down the best made grill cover you'll ever find. It also has snap latch straps at each corner to secure it around the wheels to insure (not that it ever would) blow off or up.Best $50 I ever spent...the Weber cover went right in the garbage (where it belongs) today.Don't waste your time looking and reading about other covers...your search ends here."
2,grill cover,I did not like this item this time. I had ordered one of these about 2 years ago and loved it. The item was all cloth. This new one has plastic on the underside and I DO NOT LIKE that.
5,Outstanding Grill Cover,"I was amazed at the quality of this cover compared to those I checked out in local stores like Home Depot and Lowes. Although I cannot evaluate it over the long haul yet, it is very heavy and well made and fits my grill perfectly. The handles on top make removing it quite easy and the straps at the bottom work quite well when securing the cover is necessary. The price I paid was substatially below another on line competitor. This cover is an great value!"
3,Okay,"This is okay for one season, but that's it. It mildews. I thought for the money it would be of much higher quality."
4,Great so far,"was a little un-easy about which size to get but it turned out perfect. I have a 6 burner gas grill and the XL fit nicely. material feels great, i know/hope this one will hold up through a tornado. i only gave it 4 stars because i havent really gotten to test it out, but so far so good. definatly would recommend this product."
2,lining cracked,I bought this cover in September of 2008. So at this point it is going into its third winter. The fabric of the cover is still in excellent condition ---even new looking. The thing is the plastic lining is cracked and it lets the rain through.I find it disappointing to have the fabric in excellent condition and the inside water proofing cracking apart. Well I just do not really know what is reasonable to expect as far as usable life. Seeing as the cover needs replaced now I basically got two years use out of it at a cost of about $22 a year.
5,High Quality Cover,This cover is high quality and uses very durable materials. I bought it to replace my 2 year old factory cover that turned so brittle it disintegrated. It should definitely last quite a long time.
4,Excellent Value and Well Designed,I use my grill a lot and need a quality cover to protect it from the high UV here in the south. I've bought several covers from the big box stores but they never held up or fit poorly. This cover is well engineered. The handles for removing it from the grill are particularly handy. It also has vents and an adjustable cord used to snug the bottom tight. These are features that most of the other covers don't have even at higher prices. I'm going on season two and it's holding up so I'm satisfied.
3,The skirt faded so quickly,"Green color of the skirt faded so quickly, just after one summer left outdoors; it looks very old now. When it was new, it was great, no complains."
2,Didn't last long,"I purchased this cover for my Weber Summit 600 in May 2009. I loved everything about the cover: style, fit, material, etc. However, last summer (cover was a little over a year old) a small rip developed on the side near one of the handles. This winter another larger rip happened across the top when taking it off the grill. I'm going to try one of the Weber covers before ordering another one of these."
5,Best Cover you'll ever buy!,This is really worth the money. The black plastic lined covers you see in the stores are nowhere near the quality of this cover. I still can't believe this didn't cost more. It's the best cover I've ever purchased and very well made. You will not find a better product!
2,owned 18 months--rain has ruined this cover,"I've owned this cover about 18 months, and rain/moisture has ruined this cover. First, it developed a tear within the first several months--not a fatal flaw, but one of slight concern. And having gone through not even two full seasons of winter here in Northern California, my cover has turned a shade of green, so it's fairly likely that I'm going to buy a new cover. I've read that the weber cover no longer has vents, so I may be going that route."
5,Far superior to the Weber Premium (vented) cover!!,"The Medium (58"") size fits my Weber Genesis E-320 as if it were specifically made for it!! The material is thick, well made, and should last a very long time. My complaint with the Weber premium cover is the ""venting"", it lets in moisture right at the place where your lid closes, which is a huge problem if you have cast iron grates! And, for the premium you pay for the name printed on it, my weber cover got brittle in about 5 years...yes, for an average grill, thats longer than the life of the grill, but hey, this is a WEBER, designed to last for well over 10-15 years!! Get the Veranda cover, it looks great, fits perfect, and you'll save a few bucks for other cool Weber, gadgets!"
5,Grill Cover,"I love this grill cover. It is very heavy duty and durable. To me it looks and feels like a canvas type of material. It covers the entire grill all the way to the wheels and has ties that you can secure to the wheels of the grill if you want to. We don't use the ties but will use them if we get another hurricane! I saw this grill cover in a magazine, and it was double the price I paid, so needless to say I am very pleased."
5,Very Impressive!,"Ok - -so, we bought this monster stainless grill on sale at one of the local building supply stores, and I have been looking for a cover for it. All the ones in the stores are heavy plastic that I know will crack in the Buffalo winter - - - - and then - - - -I saw this - - -WOW - - -the XL just fits - - -thank heavens - - and it looks like a material that just might make it a few years here - - - -and - - -it's BEIGE !!!!!Might not mean anything to most people, but since we have a beige house - - it just blends in beautifully.It is very attractive, and good weight. Thank you!"
3,Ok Cover,"This is an OK cover. It does not really protect from all moisture, and is already discoloring after one summer of use."
5,"Best grill cover I found, not counting the price.","Got to be the best grill cover that I could find on the Internet, not counting the price. Quality of the material is the best and it has the ability to be secured around the legs. But the best feature is the handles on the top of the cover. They allow you to move the cover over the grill with ease and its heavy enough that the wind won't blow it off."
5,best grill cover I ever owned,"I have owned several grill covers over the years, my father in law purchased one like this and after seeing his I just had to have one. It fit great , looks great and has lots of extras that most covers do not have. Very nice looking and very heavy duty. I would buy this product again and again...David BlueFredericksburg Va."
5,Excellent cover,I bought this for a Weber Genesis grill. Other reviews waved me off the Weber cover. This cover is very well made and is $10 less than the Weber cover. The medium size fits the Genesis like it was made for it.
5,Very nice BBQ Grill Cover,"This BBQ cover is top quality. It is like a canvas cover and feels durable and strong to withstand weather. The look with the dual color is nice and addes to the look of the yard. Overall, impressed and much nicer than the black cover tarps I have used in the past."
