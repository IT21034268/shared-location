5,Beautiful classy watch,"I'm a big fan of Anne Klien watches. It is a beautiful watch just as seen in the photograph: gold tone, petitie, removable links for resizing, works great and it came in a beatiful box ready for a gift."
2,Watch was DOA,"I purchased the watch for my mother this Christmas and upon receiving it, the watch did not work properly. It will not keep up with time and I assume the battery is dead. Pretty unacceptable that a ""new"" watch was sold with a dead battery.Outside of the battery, the watch looks good and it is easy to change the size, but it doesn't help if it doesn't work."
1,"This is not the original ""Chicago"" Album","I bought this CD thinking it was the same as the original Album released in the '60's. While it has the same songs, it contains live versions that are not well done by the band and not well recorded. A dismal disappointment!!!! I'm returning it."
2,"Live in Toronto, 1969","This is one of a million records/tapes/8-tracks/CD's that were released of Chicago's performance at the 1969 Toronto Rock N Roll Revival Festival. Nearly every version I've seen has the first song labelled incorrectly - its ""Introduction"", not ""Beginnings"". Not only is this an unofficial release, but Chicago has also been fighting its release since the first of many versions came out back in 1978, shortly after original guitarist Terry Kath's death.So if you're looking for a piece of history, or that one missing piece in your Chicago collection, its worth the $7 to buy this CD. If you're looking for a decent live Chicago CD, check out the following, in order of quality (best to worst):1. Chicago Live in Japan 2. Chicago XXVI Live 3. Chicago at Carnegie Hall 4. Chicago (any CD having the same track listing as this one)There are also a few excellent live videos available, like ""Live at the Greek Theatre"", and ""And the Band Played On...""."
3,Recycled (to death),"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# CWP-9917, Playing Time 49:01This 7-track live album was recorded back in 1969 at the Toronto Rock & Roll Revival; as another reviewer has pointed out, ""Beginnings"" is in fact ""Introduction"". The recording quality is below average, but the performances are adequate, considering how ""young"" the band was at this stage, with only 1 album under their belt.Unfortunately, this particular ""pressing"" of the concert is weaker than most: a poor mastering job compared to some other releases of this material, and there's a ton to choose from.I've lost count of the various editions of this disc. If you own ANY of their live albums BESIDES ""At Carnegie Hall"", ""Live In Japan"" and ""Chicago 26"", remember that you already have this, in some form or another.If you don't have these recordings, check out ""Live In Concert"" on the ORNYX label: it contains all 8 tracks (the full concert), including ""Beginnings"" (for real!)"
2,Ho-Hum,This really only kept my interest to a point and then I skimmed through just to find out how it ended. I have no desire to try any of her other books. You have to like the main characters and care about them enough to keep reading . The main character was too whiny for my tastes.
4,Smith gracefully illuminates the elegance of the lute.,"The lute, once virtually the national instrument of France, has been around for 2000 years. Although its popularity declined severely over the last 300 years, it is now experiencing a resurgence of interest, inspired in good part by English artists such as Julian Bream and Hopkinson Smith. On this CD, Smith's virtuoso command of his 11 string lute illumines the profound artistry of these 17th century suites and pieces by Jacques de Gallot. His playing conjures up visions of lovely ladies and their aristocratic swains, engaged perhaps in games of chess, and enlivened by galant conversation. This is music pervaded by sensibility and provides an ideal background for the most delicate dalliance."
5,A LADY SPEAKS TRUTH,"I met Marianne years ago when she was lecturing in Hollywood and had few followers. Over the years, her words of wisdom have drawn thousands. Truth is truth, but Marianne has a wonderful way of getting it across to the minds of the people. Now she has a book that could heal America. We need to think and act, which is what Marianne is best at. I am sure there are many rewards waiting for such a spiritual leader. Thank you Marianne"
3,inaccurate,"This book is timely and does a good job of raising general awareness about different healthcare systems. However, there are some glaring errors that make me concerned about the legitimacy of his claims. For example, he repeats ad nauseum that U.S. physicians make so much more than their international counterparts. Based on his figures (see Japan chapter), the average U.S. general practitioner makes $360,000/yr. Now, no ""average"" GP I know makes close to that much money. According to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics, the average salary for a general practitioner in the U.S. in 2008 was about $160,000. If you are going to publish a book which attempts to make arguments based on comparative economics, get your basic facts right!"
1,"Repetitive, Unoriginal, Boring","Williamson offers very little here that we don't already know. The message, of course, always falls back to love, but the author tends to beat this notion to death, over and over and over. The one lucicrous suggestion in ""Healing"" America is by disregarding Columbus Day as a means of ""healing"" the injustices suffered by Native Americans. What Williamson does not mention, is the bulk of atrocities committed against Native Americans occurred decades *after* Columbus's death. In the end, after so many years of injustice and genocide, will Native Americans feel betteror be ""healed"" by simply dropping Columbus Day? How naive. Williamson's solution will ""heal"" Native America's pain like a Band-Aid will heal multiple stab wounds."
3,Good Wrap-Up,"I liked this book because it satisfied my imagination as far as ""what ever happened?"" goes. It was clearly not up to Jane Austin's standards, but what could be? I liked it the best of all the sequel wannabes, but still realize that classic literature sometimes leaves us wanting more, but we can't have it and that's part of the allure of re-reading the original over and over again."
3,Excessively confused,"Excessively Diverted has a very interesting plot, I'll give it that. The author has lively creativity, and has formed a story completely her own... The only thing that really bothered me about this book was the ending.It seemed thrown together within the last five minutes, with everyone getting married or having children. In fact, the two major turning points in the plot are hardly resolved suitably -- along with nuptials and babies running rampant, everyone seems to turn unbecomingly sweet, as though ever since the actual Pride & Prejudice ended they've been stored in a siloh of sugar.Altogether I thought it was an intriguing book, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you were absolutely desperate for a continuation."
1,A book not even worth a look at,I hate this book I am an avid lover of Jane Austen and have read most of the sequels but this book got me so mad. Lizzie cried over stupid things and Lady C was a terrible character. I did not even find her funny anymore she was just plain mean. buy this book if you must but know I would not recomend it.
2,Excessively dull,"As an Austen fan I regularly read all sequels I can find. This one is mediocre at best. The subject is highly improbable (Mrs. Bennet as a scheming shrew, angelic Mr. Darcy, weeping Lizzy and repentant Wickham!). The author are fond of long sentences but quite forget about commas, so all heroes (including Elisabeth) are speaking without end and often without sense. The book is slightly better than ""Duty and Desire"" by Baders and Tennant's works, but far, far worse than ""Letters from Pemberley"" and ""Bar Sinister"". You may read it if you have much spare time and nothing to do."
2,"Same book, new title. Still not very good.","This book was orignially published years ago as ""Excessively Diverted"" though you will not find that in the description. There was nothing wrong with this book, it just wasn't to my liking. I certainly do not apprecaite paying for it twice! Kobo doesn't stand by its books and will not issue a refund even though the description is deceptive. Buyer beware."
2,adequate,"Juliette Shapiro is to be commended for striving to emulate the style of Jane Austen, but her efforts disappoint. It is an adequate read, but that is the best I can say about it."
3,Not Jane Austen...,"Just like many women worldwide I love the story of Pride and Prejudice. I love Elizabeth Bennett and of course the Mr. Darcy. So while I know the original can never be compared to I thought it would be fun to read some of the stories coming out that are a continued version of the story. Mr. Darcy's decision came up as the first in the pile.While I will be the first to say that this book does not have the same substance and structure as pride and prejudice, it is still an enjoyable read. Juliette Shapiro does a good job of keeping the characters as true to their original colors as possible. You have waves of angst and over all a good telling of the story.I fear I can not go into to many details as the plot is fairly well interwoven and I don't want to give any of it away. If you like Pride and Prejudice I do think you will like Mr. Darcy's decision. But you will need to always keep at the front of your mind the reminder that it is not Jane Austen."
2,Excessively Boring!!!,I do understand the author reverting back and referring to Pride and Prejudice but how many times must we endure?! This book worked my nerves but what really disturbed me was the interaction between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Wickham. I don't want to give any of the plot away for those of you that will be duped into buying this book but Excessively Diverted totally missed the mark.
1,Excessively Disappointing....,"I have long admired Austen's exquisite creation, 'Pride and Prejudice'. As a result, I enjoy exploring the various sequels which exist for this timeless classic. However, I was highly disappointed with this poor attempt to recreate my favorite literary characters. Austen's unique style and delicate prose would be difficult to replicate, and unfortunately, this author tries to remain precisely loyal to the original work without Austen's own flair for plot, entertainment, and character development. The book would have been much better had Shapiro taken a note from other successful sequels by following her own path instead of attempting a poor copy of a great original work.The plot was boring. The character alliances were beyond redemption. The language was simply too much. Moreover, Lizzy and Darcy were rendered one-dimensional and absolutely boring. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this book."
2,Read the original,"The author has a weird habit of quoting the original directly as though a new thought, and a great deal more research into manners and morals would have made a great improvement. She copies that Mrs. Bennett called her husband Mr. Bennett, but has Elizabeth call her husband ""Fitzwilliam"" and discuss his personal habits with her sister... There are many such lapses that I found less than diverting. The storyline is next to impossible in the morals of the day, but not enough to make it some form of comedy. The grammar is poor as well as modern, and the vocabulary is limited. I'd leave it off the reading list."
1,Excessively Mundane and Bizzare,"This was a most disappointing book. It had an extreme amount of quotes from P&P and I tired of reading what P&P fans already knew. I expected a new story, not re-runs. I was also disappointed because we had so little time with Jane and Bingley. The author's plots were bizarre and unlikely. All of the quicky relationships and weddings were uninteresting and unrealistic. Caroline Bingley staying with the Darcys? Mary at Rosings? Kitty as Godmother? I was hoping to read about Elizabeth as mistress of Pemberly but our time was wrapped up in another ""traumatic"" (mundane is more like it) episode with the Wickams. Couldn't the author come up with her own ideas? Don't waste your time on this weak attempt. I recommend Pamela Aiden and hopes she writes a sequel when she completes her Gentleman trilogy."
5,ExcessivelyDiverted: The Sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and,I loved this book!!! The characters have the same personalties and energy. From begining to end I enjoyed this book. It is the best sequel the Jane Austen's book. I loved the warm interaction between Mr. and Mrs Darcy. The ending left me very satisfied and happy. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
2,Excessively Disappointed,"This sequel suffers mightily from weird punctuation. Having to re-read, slow down, back up and start again simply to get the gist of the narrative is very frustrating. Call me old-fashioned but a few hundred extra commas, placed correctly, would have greatly improved this book. Jane Austen created complete, authentic finely-drawn characters; Ms. Shapiro coarsens them all. Even Lady Catherine could not have stopped so low! Add to all this the shallow, weak plot and you have one very disappointing book that cannot hold a candle to the original. ""Sequel"" is too strong a word."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Beware! This was previously published under the title ""Excessively Diverted"". Amazon.Com should issue warnings when an author changes the title and cover page of a book just to make more money. I paid my money an eagerly awaited the arrival of what I thought was a new book by Juliette Shapiro, now I feel I was conned, gyped, bamboozled by the flim-flam done by this author and Amazon.com. Hence the 1 Star rating."
2,Excessively Annoyed,"While the plot could have been worse, it was tremendously forgettable. And while Shapiro used the Austen-era language well, could someone PLEASE get this woman an editor? There were commas where they were unnecessary, and the absence of them when they were needed. Sentences ran on and on and ON. She would do well to learn that it's quite acceptable to use a semicolon, somewhere, anywhere! I unfortunately cannot get past these egregious grammatical errors, because it made the book a headache to read."
1,Written by an illiterate?,"Wow, this book was so poorly written, I couldn't get past the first few pages. You couldn't pay me to read this whole book."
2,Not really true to Darcy or Wickham's characters,This book was okay reading but I did not feel it was true to either Darcy's or Wickham's characters both in their dealings with their wives and each other. I don't think I would have bought it had I read it first.
5,Very Excessively Good,"This book is the best sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I have read. I love the way it feels like Jane Austen wrote this book. I think my favorite part of the book is the ending. It left me with a satisfieing feeling and I would like to know what the author would write as a sequel to this book.I recommend this book if you enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. The characters have the same just and energy that Austen's did. Also, it offers many new events and many fun delights. I wholely recommend this book to any and all!Enjoy!"
3,Previously Printed,"This book was previously published under the title Excessively Diverted - which I happen to think was a much better title. Do not accidentally order this book if you have already read it, but otherwise it is a good read. Not the best of the Pride and Prejudice continuations, but far from the worse as well. Worth the read if you are a devoted fan."
3,Greatly in need of an Editor,"This book is better than a lot of Austen sequels if you can get past the long sentences and the atrocious punctuation. I found this so difficult to do that I ended up editing the book myself as I read it. There were a few times that I disagreed with the author's characterizations, but most of them did not effect the plot. Charlotte Lucas Collins, for example, would have been much more devious in attempting to divert Mr. Collins from mistakes."
4,Keeps the spirit of Elizabeth and Darcy alive,"While die-hard Jane Austen fans may not like this sequel to Pride and Prejudice, I found it to be one of the better efforts I've read (and believe me, I've read quite a few). It doesn't live up to the original, but then what could? I think you will find yourself, if not excessively, at least reasonably diverted. I liked that the author allowed Elizabeth and Darcy's romance to blossom into the deeper, more mature love for each other that all devotees of Pride and Prejudice are left wishing for the main characters."
3,It is what it is,"This is an exhaust pipe bent in the shape of an ""L"". If what you need is an exhaust pipe bent in the shape of an ""L"", this is a good choice. Oh and it's stainless which is good if you don't like your exhaust pipes to rust and fall off. My only complaint is the price, it seems pretty expensive for what it is. But it's a bit longer than most competitive products, and if you need that length you're gonna have to pay."
1,Not very good,"I actually bought this item from BrandsOn Sale (Their products are very poor quality) and was very disappointed with it. It is not as shiny as the picture, it actually looked very dirty and used when we received it. Anyhow, This item looks very high-tech but it is very simple. It just vibrates and that's it. It doesn't do much of anything. I thought it would have been of better quality.Wouldn't recommend this item."
5,A must read for anyone dealing with the media,"I have just read this book and it's excellent. Mr. Walker gives great tips on how to become a better speaker. Also, he lets the reader know that if someone wants to become a better speaker, the person needs to make a lifetime commitment to it. Anyone wanting the basics on giving a speech should read this book. But only do so if you are serious about improving your public speaking."
3,Not as good as original prayer,Much more chanting and singing than interpretation on this CD. Less impactful than Original Prayer series.
5,A Treasure Beyond Measure,"Healing Breath, by Neil Douglas-Klotz, is more than a CD. It is a shared spiritual experience with the author, and with God. It took me beyond me, and to the Beloved. It cannot really be reviewed. It must be experienced."
1,"Not all it""s ""cracked"" up to be","I recently bought 2 sets of these dishes because I thought the flower pottish bowls and coffee mugs were charming. On the bottom of the plates it tells us they are dishwasher and microwave safe. They are neither. They came out of my dishmachine discolored, and just now the third saucer cracked in the microwave while melting some butter on a potato. if this has happened to you the phone number is 12128898301(of course there is no 800 number) And the manufacturer is PTS America."
4,Better than I thought,"I really thought this movie was going to [stink], because I don't think it ever even made it to theatres. But now that I've seen it, I'm surprised I had never heard of it. Of course, it's not genius, or Oscar-worthy, but it was better than a lot of movies that are in the theatres right now. And if Van Wilder didn't convince you that Ryan Reynolds is destined for greatness, this movie will. He is sexy, hilarious, charismatic, and soooo sexy. Did I mention sexy?!?"
4,(:D) ....ok,This movie is sooo funny. Some of the parts will seriously have you rolling. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and a complete stud!
2,"Waste of time, but its got Alyssa Milano!","I got this movie for one reason only: Alyssa Milano. All fans of hers should see this film. However, I was very disappointed that she has a very small role and is in only 2 scenes. This forced me to sit through a very unoriginal and unfunny gross out/romantic comedy. Jerry O'Connell has never impressed me in any of his work and he should stay away from films. Ryan Reynolds could be very funny, but hes stuck being cast as a moron who thinks he can get away with anything because of his good looks, but he tries to hard. Bridget Wilson is wasted in her role, and should get a new agent. There are a couple of funny scenes but for the most part I was bored and uninterested. Skip it, unless you're a die hard Alyssa Milano or Ryan Reynolds fan."
5,milk it for all it's worth!,"I rent alot of movies...and I get disappointed alot too. I wasn't expecting much when I found this movie and rented it...but I found a gem! Just the cast alone is worth getting this movie - I thought they were all great and fit their roles. Everyone of them made me laugh at some point...but Ryan Reynold's was hysterical to me! He rocked! Even if the plot wasn't the greatest...Ryan's role in the film alone is worth watching. I am a hopeless romantic, though, so I liked the whole story and it's definately going in my dvd collection. I was surprised I had never heard of it...but am so glad I found it. I told all my friends about it and would recommend it to anyone! It's not meant to change the world or win an oscar - but it made me feel good and I laughed more than I have in a while...it will do the same for you."
2,Stupid is as stupid does,Save your breath unless you just can't get along without the eye candy maybe. I hope they recouped the cost of the film.
4,Nice to have if you're not using lighscribe,Prints labels without any problems. recommend getting power adapter because the eight batteries don't last very longCasio AD-A12280L AC Adapter for CW-75 CD Title Writer
2,NO FOLLOW UP FROM MANUFACTURER,I have emailed the manufacturer at least 3 times. My problem is still a problem. Each time I attempt to print a label I have to rewind the ribbon. The manufacturer promised to send along a new ribbon to see if it would rewind but has not done so.
4,Relaxing and Meditative,"I have used the first disk as an acompaniment to full body massage . I have found that it relaxes my client , while energizing me to keep up a pace for a full body massage."
3,good for the quick and dirty,"a good basic mongage of Chinese designs, but they are pretty limited, and mostly standard. they seem almost 'clip art'. my advice would be to study Chinese art history, learn the motifs and themes, and the way they presented things, and then create your own. but for the quick and dirty approach, this book isn't bad."
4,a good window to understand Chinese culture,Desing is always good coponent in certain culture. this book provide you wonderful materials to get to know thedesign which just belong to CHina.
5,The Mountain Golden Eagle Tee,This was a gift for my hubby so I ws able to wash and dry it before giving it to him. It didn't shrink very much at all. Pretty true to size.
2,not happy with design,As most of the t's i buy from the mountain are very nice this one was not up to the normal standards of the mountain design at all. i should have sent it back but i didn't if nothing else i can cut off the sleeves and wear it for everyday chores around the house. it really looked phoney to me and in the future i will send any back that don't look up to standards for the money we have to pay for these they should be almost lifelike and this one was not at all.
5,Best roof repair product,"This product worked very well for me, I managed to fix all my leaks on a rubber flat roof. Hightly recommended."
3,"Tango, but no Tango","This is yet another film I purchased in my pursuit of all movies that may or may not have tango dance scenes in it. Although this movie has a decent story, don't be misled by the title which contains the word Tango. There is no Tango, neither dance nor music, in this movie. So if you are a fan of tango like myself and was curious about purchasing this movie based on the title, don't do it!"
2,"A few nice moments, but nothing special","Barefoot Gen is based on a famous award winning japanese comic book. Frankly you're better to read the original than sit through this sentimentalized and trite offering. While there are moments of spectacle (the bombing and the horrific aftermath), it's basicaly a ""good feeling"" movie set in Hiroshima.While it might've been worth renting, it's definitly not a ""must have"". Much better you spend your cash on the masterpiece ""Grave Of the Fireflies"".The DVD includes some liner notes but no additional information. The picture quality is fine -- no particular problems."
5,fasteners,Excellent product but I would expect nothing less from Scotch! Great for EZ pass and I-Pass holders even for GPS units!
2,I never received mine,"i never got the product so i can't write a proper review, don't know what I am doing probably but to my defense; all the other products i bought were downloaded"
5,My favorite!,"I've tried a few different flavors of Nut-Thins, and these are by far my favorite! They have a nice, bold ranch flavor that I can't get enough of, and even my non-gluten free husband can't stop eating them. If I were able to start eating gluten again, I'd continue to buy these crackers. I love that I can get them in a 12-pack, as it's hard to keep them around!"
2,Umm.. Have fun installing this.. NOT!,"Yes, I like this now that it's on BUT it was an absolute pain to install, especially if you're by yourself and you don't want to scratch that barrel. First, the directions are terrible and don't explain key points of installation like how you'll have to somehow spread open the rear of the shield, and second how you'll need to do your own cutting of the dumb plastic spacer. I put two of these on two Mossy 500 persuaders and it was easier the second time, but still annoying for sure. Ps I'm not an idiot, and I know how to use my tools."
2,Almost lost hardware for a note from the seller,Length:: 3:27 MinsADDED AFTER VIDEO: Hod to return product because it doesn't fit the Mossberg 500 Special Purpose
3,"Good quality, didn't work for me.","This is probably a no-brainer, but the head shield will only work on plain barrel models. Any ported, ribbed or fitted with rifling sights don't allow proper installation."
3,Mossberg at its un-finest,"Purchased this heat shield and recieved it promply, no problems there. Unit arrived as described. When installing, the mounting bracket of the heat shield was too wide to allow the screws to fasten the unit together. I promply broke the six poor spot welds attempting to get the bracket diameter small enough to close. Luckily for me, I have a machinist friend next to my office who welded the unit back together for me and made it stronger. He told me the welding job was bad on my unit, maybe not so bad on others? also the spacer was 1/8"" short for my 8 shot 500. Would i buy again? yes, but only because this is the only metal heatshield i have found on the market for this shotgun. Seller was great, product wasnt. Im a little dissapointed with this factory mossberg product."
3,Mossberg monster!,"My Mossberg 500 now has the tactical, kick your door in, look I was after. There was some very very slight fitment issues - but that's more installer error. After it was all said and done, it took about 10 mins to install.Giving it 3 stars only for the chintzy construction - would have preferred some heavier stamped steel, but hey, I was suckered in and bought it anyway. You won't be dissappointed."
3,Iffy,"The item was a bit rough out if the box, spots that appeared unfinished or where something corrosive had contacted it. The instructions were, at best, only partially helpful. Perhaps they had been translated from french or chinese. The two screws for the front end were too short to tighten the sides together, I had to buy two, longer screws to bring the sides close enough to use th originals. Finally on the gun the fit appears tight, I have yet to fire the gun to see if the heat sheild shakes lose.Now that I've put some bluing paste on the unfinished spots, the heat sheild appears reasionably ok. we'll see how well it stays in position. In all, not what I had expected from a ""factory"" original."
2,Will interfere with the 500 20 gauge operation,Had to send it back since it impacted loading shells-took it to the gun shop-they verified-should have stated for 12 gauge only on the site
5,THIS HEAT SHIELD IS NO JOKE,"Fit my 500A made in 1994 perfectly. Also the holes on the front mounting tabs of the heat shield lined up perfectly with the holes on the New Laserlyte Shotgun Tri Rail Mount. Thought I was going to give up the Laserlyte Shotgun Tri Rail Mount for the heat shield. I almost went with a cheaper one, glad I didn't..."
1,Disappointed!,This was so small I don't think it would have fit even some toddlers heads. We were so disappointed in it.
3,Nice Movie with PC agenda,"The other reviews are accurate. This is beautifully crafted film. The plot however turns around a lesbian relationship. Lesbians are compassionate and wonderful, Christians are small minded, ignorant, and repressive. Unless you want to be fed pro homosexual, anti Christian propaganda skip this film, no matter how well made it is."
5,One of my fav. films WONDERFUL,"I love this movie. i watched it years ago on an independant channel and fell in love. i have told everyone i meet to watch this. The music is amazing. It makes you wish you were part of that mountian too! if you've never seen it, you won't be dissapointed."
4,Good movie,"Good movie, superb music and I'm glad to find a story that doesn't portray all Appalachian people as ignorant.The setting of mountains of North Carolina were beautiful.The movie could have done away with the homosexual subplot and focused more on the professor's ""songcatching."""
3,Shotgun Approach,"Having grown up in these very places, I was able to enjoy the scenery and the music, and especially seeing old friends like Sheila Kay Adams playing banjo at the dance. If you're not a fan of folk music, you might not catch all the cameos: Iris DeMent, Hazel Dickens, etc. If you are a fan, then there's just not enough music, and the cameos are painfully short.The shotgun approach to plot, though, is tiresome. Is this about feminism, lesbianism, modernism, or music? Ignorance and arson....well, we couldn't have a movie about the hills without some stereotypes, could we? Not to mention forced accents.Charming, but could have been done better."
4,No videophile; really enjoyed it,"I thoroughly enjoyed SONGCATCHER. To the reviewer who wonders what's the central theme: an educated music woman escapes to backwoods America in the 1800's and finds herself , to her surprise, in the heart of the very music she loves. Yes, there are other goings-on (the buy-out of resident farms, a lesbian relationship, more). These are called ""sub plots"" and add atmosphere to the film. It's hard not to see that the main character's discovery of and love for the music is the central theme. While I wish the main characters carried more emotion toward each other, I appreciate that it didn't sacrifice the message for a mushy love story. The movie is very realistic for the time period, and the music is wonderful."
4,Capturing Culture,"I for one thought that Songcather was a wonder chance to hear the music and gather some perspective on North Carolina culture at the turn of the century. I am sorry that this movie was not better promoted. As for some who found some the content objectionable, I would suggest people remember to look at the label for the rating on movies and read the jacket. This is PG-13. If one is afraid of people with different world views than his or her own, then by all means, do not rent this and instead stick with some of the Disney classics that I love which depict a pleasent and simple view of things. However, if you want to see real people with all their beauty and flaws then this movie allows for a thought provoking storyline --though the real beauty of the movie is the music."
5,Excellent story and cast!,"I saw this in the theater years ago. The music is so real and so fabulous. The story has many facets, some that will really surprise the viewer."
5,Songcatcher,I had seen this film many years ago and was happy I could order it. Liked the story line and it had a lot of mountain music in it. It came in the time alotted and was in excellent condition. I am very pleased.
2,Why? What's the point?,"There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard. But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole? Nothing. So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin."
3,"Wonderful film, but NOT for children","I have to say that the only reason I gave this film a three star rating instead of a four is the subject matter of the lesbians in the film. I am so sick of Hollywood film makers striking yet another blow for the pro-gay movement. It was so out of place in this film, and as a plot not even believable. The turn of the century was a different time and place and there is no way I would believe these two women would have been tolerated to teach school in this conservative area. Other than that, this could have been a wonderful family film. As it is, I don't go out of my way to reccomend it to people with young children. The music is wonderful and if you love the traditional music, buy the soundtrack cd called ""Songcatcher Two."" You will love it. The film has a terrific cast, especially Pat Carroll. Fine for adults."
4,THE MUSIC IS THE STAR - THE PEOPLE ARE THE STAGE,"The mountain music is so well done in this film. Pat Carrol is real and warm, and the cast carries the feeling of the life and times into a memorable trip in the turn of the century mountains. The soap opera part of the work, the lesbian teachers, and the feminist point of view are the distractions, but not enough to overcome the wonderful music and the scenery. The realistic depiction of the life and scenery of the mountains, as well as the camera work in the interiors and the great scenes at the dance, makes this worth seeing more than once."
4,Loved it!,Loved the music! Loved the movie! Makes me want to live there in that time period...guess I'll just have to keep going to bluegrass festivals...
5,Songcatcher,Songcatcher is both an interesting drama and a showcase for some excellent singing. One of the songs is about a man who has no land of his own and thus cannot court a wife; he imaginatively describes his longing in the song. Viewers with open minds are recommended to this film.
2,Great Expectations,"I got this movie based on the rave reviews here and expected to hear tons of old time Appalachian music in real mountain settings but what I got was a typical hollywood drama. That is so sad because this movie has all of the potential in the world to highlight the music it extolls but fails to deliver.I found that ""Where the Lillies Bloom"" offers a much better and realistic Appalachian experience."
3,Don't See It for the Plot,"Weak transitions and acting shouldn't deter you from seeing the movie for the wonderful music, scenery and story. Aiden Quinn's acting is improbable, the emotional leap Penleric makes and the throw-it-all-away for love denoument are to be overlooked. Otherwise it's a good movie and worth watching."
2,"An ""agenda"" film that needs an ""R"" rating","Songcatcher has all the elements of a beautiful story, rich video and lovely audio work. All that is ruined when the real motivation for the film emerges. It is a no-holds-barred advocacy piece for lesbianism with graphic sexual content that should have earned the film an R rating. How it recieved an PG-13 is probabally another political story...Sure, these movies are made and sold, but the buyer should have some idea of what they are getting. The soft sell marketing copy for Songcatcher leaves the unsuspecting buyer with a big ""GOTCHA"""
4,Song Catcher Sings,"The DVD for the ""song Catcher"" is a high quality product for a very interesting film. Delivery was prompt and as promised. I enjoyed it."
5,Awesome,"AWESOME MOVIE. FANTASTIC look into the old timey ways of mountain folks. Thedvd extras are great too, with singing and different stuff. Just great."
1,I will never watch this again....,"As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it. I found myself thinking throughout the movie ""I can't believe I'm actually watching this. What a waste!"" Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes. The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story. Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic. I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.)"
2,"Great music, but thats about it.","This film does a great job of capturing Olde Time Southern music in its original time and place. Music that makes the toe tap as well as, putting shivers down your spine, its all there. The cinemotagraphy, while doing a decent job at conveying the grittier side of moutain life, overall is a little dissapointing. Tthe story takes place in one of the most beautiful parts of America, yet the only time you even see a mountain range is for 2 seconds. Adain Quinn is awesome as the pipe smoking, aloof but educated mountain man. But the lead actress's, (wanna-be Dr Quinn Medicine woman) overacting is alomost too painful to watch. If they had casted someone better, the movie would have been superb."
3,Music is all that holds it together,"I was entised by the story after hearing a review of it on NPR, However there was much in the movie that was omitted from the review. Pat Carroll was the best performance by far. Music was exceptional, worth enduring the movie in fact. The majority of the performances were wholey unbelievable and the whole ""all dedicated female school teachers of the era are lesbians"" undertone was a bit much. It tended to detract from the movie's emphasis on the music. Not a video worth purchasing, nor for children."
1,Great Stuff for the Men Hater's Club,"Hearing that this movie was the winner of an award at the Sundance Film Festival my wife and I greatly anticipated watching this film. The scenery is beautiful. The music is wonderful. However, the overtones in this movie are horrendous, unless you are a feminist who hates men. If you are, then you will love this movie."
1,Disturbingly Lesbian Film,"Yes, what looks like a great family film is actually a disturbing vehicle to promote lesbian values. I was so disgusted by the lesbianism and partial nudity that I didn't even finish it. YYUUUUCCKKK!!!!"
3,"Good, but could have been better",I just watched the VHS last night. The filming is beautiful and the acting superb but this movie could have been phenomenal if the lesbian love affair had been omitted all together. I was offended by their foreplay scene and if it had been at the begining of the film I would have stopped watching it.The music is great and hope that the soundtrack is as good as the music displayed on the film.
1,Deceptive...,"The cover makes you think that you're getting a family-friendly, ""Hallmark Hall of Fame""-type movie. In reality, however, you get a movie that accepts and condones adultery, homosexuality, and anti-Christian stereotyping. The main character is an adulteress, her sister engages in lesbianism (including some brief nudity and sexual kissing), and the ""Bible-believers"" rail not only against homosexuality, but also singing and ""book-learning"". The music of the ""mountain people"" is a sidebar in this relativistic, 21st-century, ""do what feels good"" independent movie. I wish I'd never seen it."
4,A great film undermined by feminist-lesbian agenda.,"This is a film that I thought was great to a point. Then I felt that I was at a Gloria Steinem speech or a NOW convention or a lesbian film festival. There was no need for the anti-Christian or pro-lesbian element. Only the director felt that need. It would have been a great film without that. If the CD has all the songs on it, I'll buy it. I have to look for it. It would be incredibly perfect for a film CD. Great songs! As for the director, get off it. You'll do much better as a real person rather than an Ellen Degenerate fan."
2,almost good,"The acting in this movie is top notch--especially the performance from Janet McTeer. However, the directing and writing has a lot to be desired. The problem I had with the directing was that it 1) was too slow, and 2) consisted of too many close-up shots. The problem I had with the writing was that it contained TOO many themes: 1) Janet McTeer ""catching"" songs, 2) the lesbian relationship, 3) Janet McTeer and Aidan Quinn's relationship, 4) Reese having an affair with another woman, 5) real estate man trying to buy out the homes in the mountain, 6) Reese's wife becoming an established painter, and 7) servant girl and boy's relationship problems. You see, too many themes. I definitely would've gotten rid of the lesbian relationship, and Reese having an affair with another woman--they didn't add anything to the story. Finally, I was not impressed by the ending. To me, it seemed too abrupt."
1,part wonderful part big letdown,"this movie is so beautiful visually, and the ""songcatcher's"" story of capturing the music of the hills is a rewarding adventure.the crushing of men and the sweetness or strength and character of women is rather severe.the main ""plot"" of the story comes near the end, and is such a letdown from the beauty of the songcatcher story.my impression was not at ALL that this was a feministic, lesbian, oppression story. what a letdown. as if the women had to turn to each other because all the men were such pigs.this could have been such an exquisite movie if the overall plot had anything to do with the songcatching!"
2,Advancing an Agenda,"Why do otherwise wonderful movies feel a need to advance an agenda? The time spent on the homosexual scenes combined with the retribution and the church condemnation scene add up to an intentional focus on the minority actions of our society -- homosexuals and bigotted Christians, both of which do exist, but neither of which represent anything close to the norm. This movie depicts both with a definite slant toward homosexuality and against Chritianity.Why?"
1,Songcatcher - Winner of the Sundance Film Festival?,"I love a good movie, unfortunately, this was not one of them. The main reason why I believed what was reviewed before was that it had Aidan Quinn in the movie. He is a great actor! You can't go wrong with him in it. He did great, some of the music was ok, but some of the acting was really horrible. This is one that I wish that I watched from a download. Not worth a tinker's dirty socks in my opinion."
1,Mixed response,"The music was what i grew up hearing.....my Granny was a singing woman.....i was born and raised in the mountains of Western NC and Eastern Tn. My Great Granddaddy was a music teacher from Keen Ireland.....i know these songs and the people they came from......they are my people...the hymns were as much as part of the air as the songs in this film..hymns were as much a part of the culture as the secular songs....yet, they were completly absent from the movie, giving a very distorted view of the culture. Also, the attitude of the church goers toward the two gay women in the movie was not the attitude of the church people i grew up with ...the moviemakers operated out of the same narrow judgemental perspective as the church goers in the movie. Wonderful character development, Emmy Rossum's voice and charachter portrayal was right on target, as ws some of the others. A few of the more subtle values of the ""highlander"" culture were wonderfully presented in this movie."
5,love it,The first time I watched this movie was on HBO. I never saw the beginning of it. I took the chance to check on Amazon and there it was! I liked the movie because it was set in the Mountains of the Blue Ridge. Some on our family grew up in that area and played music that you hear in the movie. I would suggest it to anyone that loves folk music.
3,THE BEAUTIFUL DOMINIQUE SWAIN IN A [not so good] MOVIE!!!!,"ASIDE FROM DOMINIQUE SWAIN, THIS MOVIE IS A TOTAL WASTE. IT IS SLOW THROUGHOUT AND IT HAS A VERY WEIRD PLOT.NOT WORTH A LOOK UNLESS YOU WOULD ONLY SEE IT FOR DOMINIQUE SWAIN.THAT IS MY EXCUSE, AND ALTHOUGH THE MOVIE WASN'T GOOD, DOMINIQUE SWAINS' BEAUTY SHINES THROUGHOUT!!!!!!THIS MOVIE SHOWS A TALENTED ACTRESS IN A [not so good] MOVIE!!!BUT HEY...... IT'S DOMINIQUE, SO IT MUST BE WORTH A LOOK!!!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This movie was not a very in-depth movie. The main character, the girl, is crazy. The ending was awful. The background music is bizzare. Don't waste your time."
1,One of the worst I've seen,"Dead in the Water has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes it is slow paced. That is not really the main problem. The problem is that nothing ever happens. I can handle slow pacing if it is used to establish intersting characters or an intricate story, but this movie has neither. Basically nothing happens for the first 40 minutes. There is some expository dialogue about trading stocks that is confusing and completely uninteresting, and does nothing to establish the characters or the story. When the ""big turning point"" finally happens there is not much reason to care. The features on the DVD are hardly noteworthy. There is an alternate ending that makes no sense whatsoever. There is also a short behind the scenes featurette and a short film made by the same director. My advice is to avoid this movie and save yourself the nearly two hours of sheer boredom."
1,Utterly Poor,"Boy, what a bust. On all counts. The story goes nowhere. The actors, who have all done good work in other films, have nothing to work with. As a suspense/thriller, which is apparently what it is supposed to be, it fails miserably on every level.And the DVD itself? The only feature of interest is the writer/director's short film, with a commentary track, that is more interesting than the feature length film. Inexplicably, an alternate ending to the feature is included that not only has no audio (and it IS a dialogue scene), but makes no sense whatsoever in context with what we've scene in the finished film. And the Production Featurette? 3 or 4 minutes of raw video footage of a handful of scenes being shot.Stay far away from this one, it's not even good for a laugh."
1,1 star is too much,I got all excited when I saw dominique's name flash on the screen. I loved her since Lolita. But this movie just sucks big time. The very beginning was horrible and it got a little better after the murder but I saved myself from this horrible movie and changed the channel. I didn't care about the movie anymore.
1,"it made sense, it just sucked",the body in the beginning is the main girl. at the beginning she floats with her blue top and pink/orange bikini bottom on. at the end before she does what she does she jumps off the boat wearing that. this movie overall has no point. just like this review. i just wanted to clear up that other reviewer's confusion.
4,COOL MIX!,now i don't know about onyone else! but i happened to like the way they 'smashed' alot of their hits from the two earlier albums they produced!
4,45 minutes of Daft Punk bliss!,"Forty-five minutes of live Daft Punk action recorded in Birmingham, England, in November, 1997. This isn't exactly a ""live"" CD - there isn't any ""Hello Cleveland"" or extended drum solos (alas, no spinning drum kit) - more a ""live mix"" CD.Having seen them live on the same tour (Cambridge, UK), i was blown away by what i heard/saw, but part of me was also wondering, ""Is it real/Memorex/sequencer?""Then IT hit me - who cares!?! THIS IS GREAT!Okay sound quality (little to no crowd noise) and the disc i got (from the UK) came with free stickers! Such a deal, and it cost less than the ticket to get into the gig...Why only 4 *'s? It could have been longer, it could have been a DVD (the extra bit of the ""D.A.F.T."" DVD wasn't enough!), and c'mon folks, it's not like it's ""Pet Sounds"" or ""Revolver"" (or even the wonderful ""Homework"")"
3,Perfect,"Light Flashlight Perfect for Car, Picnic, Camping.....Everything Function Pocket Tool with LED FlashlightEverything Function Pocket Tool with LED Flashlight"
4,Nice Quality Led Clip Light!,This thing is great for just under 12 bucks! No way is it worth the over 30$ retail! The light is quite bright and the clip is strong. I would definitely buy another as long as the price is the same!
2,Doesn't fit on jeep sun visor,"Bought to add light to my Jeep Wrangler...problem is, despite the picture, these do not open wide enough to clip onto the hard Jeep visor.Also the pivot point is far too loose and they wiggle too much and don't stay in place.Certainly not worth $10, even if they would clip on as advertised"
2,Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest,This mouse pad looks cheaper than the cost of it.In order for the nonskid base to work you need to stick the two-way adhesive tape provided to the surface where it would be used. This is bad if you wanted to use it in more than one places like I do. Thus i don't use the adhesive tape and the mouse pad easily slides on my wooden desk.The Gel wrist rest is big and feels very comfortable and my mouse slides very nicely over the pad.I would only recommend this product if it looked neatly assembled.
3,Hit or miss,"These labels seem to work on some cables better than others, I find that some I have wrapped on cables will peel off over time."
5,Great pocket brain!,"A Midwife's Handbook is an excellent resource for those who are students and for those who are practicing midwives. Succinct and in a handy format, this book is a must for all midwives and aspiring midwives!"
3,helpful,I bought this in preparation to become a midwife but after plans changed I didnt need the book anymore. It was a good book and a good read. If you are interested in pregnancy and childbirth.
1,Watch out power-metal fans.,"I, myself, am a hard-core power metal fan, I love epic melodies and powerful vocals...the things that make power metal. This album is a very good progressive metal album...but as far as power metal goes, Axenstar seems to have shed their old style for a more faddish prog-metal style...which is definitely an extreme disappointment to me...2 stars...compared to their earlier releases....I always give bands who change their style to make more money low ratings. 4/5 for prog-metal, but 1/5 for power metal.A good prog-metal album...but people looking for good power metal....don't buy this."
4,Oracle8i DBA: Backup and Recovery Exam Cram (Exam: 1Z0-025),"Hello!I am Oracle 8i certified. All of these exam cram books are very good. I have used those for all me exams. Now I am looking for Oracle 9i upgrade ( upgrade from 8i to 9i - new features for admin) book. When it will be available????????????Thanks,Priti Patel"
1,"Haphazard syntax and English --- Frastrating, Not make sense","This is one of the worst books I 've ever read.As other said, you may be able to pass the OCP test, butlearn nothing.- Syntax written here is extremely haphazard.If you are a programmer, you will get angry wiht her.- No proofreading. Nobody seems to have done proofreading.Lots of misspelling, wrong English grammer(She speaks Oranglish instead of English.),and the sentences themselve do not make sense.Just frastrating. Networking book on this series is good.Basically, this kind of book should be written by c or c++ programmers who are familiar with Oracle RDBMS I/O Oranglish speakingstupid DBA."
1,what a poor book. Oracle DBA is crazy ????,"Lots of strange expressions, wrong syntax, misspelling.This is a kind of disease for stupid Oracle DBAs,called Oranglish cyndorome. They can not speal English.Do not buy this book."
5,very good,"i've only used it a few times. i bought it when it was on sale for 35 dollars. very good for the price. i'm sure there's probably sharper knives out there but for 35 dollars, you can't beat that. this is why i gave it five stars. it's also a cool looking knife. but even for 50 dollars, i think this is a good knife to get. but really, i think when it comes to knives, everyone has their own opinion. so good luck."
1,No Response,After having these knifes for about a year they stared to chip and crack on the blade edges. They were very-well cared and always hand washed. We have send several emails to Calphalon and tried calling them and recieved no response from Calphalon it appears they just could care less.I would strongly recommend staying away from any of their products!!!!!!
3,"Based on real data, some of the conclusions could be better.","As the book says (not a quote) We all have heart disease by the time we are in our 40's, if not sooner. As if that is the natural state of the world and nothing can be done to prevent that.Let's assume it's true that the drugs will prevent you from dropping dead from it as soon as you would without them. No argument with that. He supports his argument pretty well.The one point I would argue with is the assumption that heart disease is a natural fact of life. It is not. It is the result of the way we eat and live in this culture. Read Atkins and EsselstynPrevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cureabout that.He takes a very practical approach to treating heart disease which is that most of us are unable or unwilling to eat a very low fat diet and maybe exercise. If that is you, this is probably your best shot. If you can change your diet and get out and move, do that."
4,Idea-Filled Stories About Delightful People,"I've read nearly all of Spider Robinson's work, and it seems to have two constants: Fascinating ideas and characters who are both ferociously intelligent *and* genuinely nice. _User Friendly_ is no exception. Being singletons, these stories don't give the same emotional satisfaction as (say) another visit to Callahan's or Lady Sally's, but on their own terms they're both thought-provoking and full of undisguised affection for the human race and its various members.I invariably put down a Spider Robinson book with a wide grin, a racing mind, and a more optimistic outlook on life and its possibilities. If that ain't good value for your six bucks plus shipping, I don't know what is . . .Fair Warning: DO NOT read the back-cover blurb, in which an unspeakable copywriter at Baen Books gives away crucial parts of two stories and the entire point of a third."
4,"Not stellar, but still a good read.","While not quite as engrossing as some of his more extended works (the Callahan's saga; the Sta Dance series), this collections of short stories is still very much worth the price. The title story tells of how aliens come to Earth, enslave random peoples minds, and the populace acccepts it. It's fresh ideas like these, strongly presented in a no-holds-barred style that add real punch to each piece."
3,"Intersting, amusing, but not up to his normal standards.","A collection of ""second string"" stories, which seem to have been written more for SR's amusement than our own. Interesting diversions, but not compelling. Still, it's a must for Spider Robinson fans, because it gives some wonderful insights into his life and writing."
2,No Frills Robinson philosophy. Lacking Entertainment value.,"I have enjoyed thoroughly most of Mr. Robinson's works. Sadly, not User Friendly. I prefer my philosophy disguised in a story line. For once, I am glad I bought the paperback. Another timewaster like this and I'll have to find another favorite author."
5,Louisiana Lovin',"Wow, I really enjoyed Southern Exposure!! Karen Kelley did an incredible job weaving erotism into a well-written plot that threathens romance with murder and betrayal. And many kudos for the secondary romances as well!! I enjoy stories set in New Orleans but when I am taken (as a reader) into the Louisiana bayous...that is when the fun really begins. The scene of the heroine taking the hero out into the swamp in a piroque, for safe keeping, was just awesome....and then when they hit land....I will never forget it. YUM!! Southern Exposure is quite simply...fantastic!"
2,"Readable, but not recommended. While reading, I wished it would be over.","The first chapter was the best part. A reporter was dancing on stage as a stripper for a story. He met Jody a cop in the audience. After that, nothing was special or creative. I didn't smile at interesting conversation. The sex scenes had a bland effect on me. Nothing surprised or delighted me. A quote from page 224 follows. ""It took them longer to convice Captain Williams they were doing the right thing, but Fallon had always been known for her skills of persuasion and it wasn't long before they were driving through the entrance of Andrea's apartment complex."" I would have preferred to hear the details of an interesting conversation that ""showed"" Fallon's skills of persuasion rather than being ""told"" with the summarizing sentence written.Sexual content: not evaluated. Setting: current day New Orleans. Copyright: 2005. Genre: contemporary romantic suspense."
1,Super Hits 98,"I never recieved my product, it was out of stock. But I was informed and the money was refunded in a timely manner."
1,Egg Biscuits,"I've been looking for Stella D'Oras' Round Egg Biscuits, they were a very dry airy kind of cookie, they had plain and frosted. I loved the plain ones, they were round but had a scallopped edge to them with a hole in the center. I can't find these anywhere and wish I could, if anyone knows where to find these please let me know!"
4,Blast from the past,"I love this CD, sounds great. The songs give me the same feeling I'd get back in the 60's when I went to see them perform live at the Peppermint Beach Club in Virginia Beach."
5,EXCELLENT CD,SONG SELECTION AND LIVE RENDITIONS WERE GREAT. GIVES YOU THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'RE THERE LIVE. SOUND QUALITY WAS ALSO GREAT.
5,Better than the Trilogy,"If you thought the Matrix Sequels were bad, then this game will help you fall in love with the story again. Walk in Neo's shoes as he develops and and Becomes the one. The game expands where it needs to and alters the story all around for the better, allowing you to learn more about the Matrix world than the Movies share with you. The Gameplay is pretty fun and the graphics are dated but done well for its time and is still pretty to look at.If you liked the movies, you will love this. If you like the story, but hated the sequels you will love this game even more. Definitely Buy it if you are a gamer, enjoys older games, and/or Enjoy the matrix. While i think giving a perfect review is often cheesy, this one certainly earned it."
3,Vianna Stibal Missing?,"after reading the book I've just got to ask, how come the Medical Intuitive, Vianna, who started this healing technique not mentioned at all? but I did give it a 3 in case I missed that somewhere in the book.let me say positive things about it though, at least Dr. Gerard is spreading the teachings of DNA activations. I've used this technique and it works very well, easily and quickly. With that, I would recommend the books by Vianna Stibal, Go Up and Seek God and Go Up and Work with God. These are the unadulterated version of the 12-Strand DNA Technique directly channeled from Source.Dr. Gerard (Vianna's former student) and his book is a good introduction to the real thing."
2,A little Frustrating,"Ok, the first half of this book does nothing more than talk about purchasing some DNA activation kit and joining the authors home base of practitioners. Similar to the ""cures they do not want you to know about"" scam. I will say that there is some good information in this book, but would not understand that had I not known about other holistic healing modalities that describe the same things. This book appears to be a trademark promotion based on several other holistic philosophies. More power to you if you can do it... but the author is going to have to come up with some original material. This book didn't offer me anything I haven't read about or experienced before."
3,works but ...,"works perfectly fine .. but apparently in the description no where does it say that these papers are loosely inbetween two cardboard peices. as a first time buyer from this seller, not exactly sure if i wanna keep buyin. gotta step up your game guys an get your stuff together :/"
4,carbon paper,"The product, once it arrived, was worth the cost and works well. When we need more, we will more than likely get it from the same place."
4,cool night-warm milk,"I first heard of this album from a friend. He said he liked the way she sounded, so I took his judgement call and went with it. She's good and creepy sounding. Reminds me of 2 o'clock in the morning in front of an open window, and some of the songs I make. While it's missing something I cant put my finger on, song #4 melts me..I can imagine that her next album will truly startle me."
4,Near perfect effort,"there are still a few things Chan is missing. her songwriting skills are excellent, her voice flawless, her instrumentation perfectly sparse. what's missing? her presence. compared to people like Tori Amos and Paula Cole, Chan appears to be afraid of any recognition. while this is a very superficial point, it's the one that's keeping her from wider acclaim."
4,subtle implosions,A great disc. One that grows on you with repeated listenings...haunts you to a degree...definitely a mood disc for moments when you want to wallow.
3,Charming and intriguing but overrated,"I think that this work by Cat Power is worth listening and has some very good moments. Anyway, despite the fact that I like intimistic music and listened to it several times, I still cannot understand why it had so many ecstatic reviews all around the world. It is a very moody record from begining to end and neither the music nor the lyrics left me wanting more at the end of the CD."
4,Not too shabby,"First time hearing this I wasn't terribly impressed, but after I realized it wasn't going to speed up and I actually paused and listened to the words, it really grew on me. The gentle melodies are comforting, and her voice is edgy and beautiful. A very calm collection, almost disturbingly so... I'd reccomend this to those who are willing to sit and ponder peacefully."
2,"Although addictive, Moon Pix may be a tiny bit overrated.","I bought this cd based strictly on these reviews. I received it today. I'm listening to it now; I've been listening all day. There's something about it I can't shake. All the reviews were ultimately favorable, yet nondescript. It seemed so mysterious I HAD to check it out. Moon Pix is a bit like the Velvet Underground, Kristen Hersh, Mazzy Star and the Cowboy Junkies all rolled up together but never as good as any of those, yet still good. Moon Pix is not great, but it could be. Moon Pix is full of MOMENTS and all those beautiful melting moments have entranced me. The music is there, although at its worst its repetitive. The emotions are there. The mood is set. Her voice is beautiful, but I'd love to see her bloom into a more mature lyricist. With so many glowing reviews of this disc it's surprising to see nothing under Cat Power's other two discs."
2,What was I thinking?,"Maybe I'll have to give this another few listens, but my first impression is that this is mostly unmelodious (is that a word?) garbage. I hope I grow to like it more. But my advice for now -don't waste your money."
4,"Eerie, moody, minimalist pop","Don't listen to this if you're off your medication. These are some haunting and deeply personal songs. Standout tracks: ""Metal Heart"", ""Colors and the Kids"", and ""Cross Bones Style"". If you like this, give a listen to Lisa Germano, who's probably more adept as a songwriter."
3,Raw underwelming talent,"Ms. Marshall always seemed to get an undue amount of credit as an indie female songwriter, when in fact she is usually guilty of just highly embellishing numbingly simple songs. On rare occasions her attempts at a haunting minimalism by way of undereducated musician do work, and with this being one of her earliest discs we do have a few seamless tracks. Roughly half of the album however retains her signature trickery of which yields little more then boring songs dragged thru her lo-fi production in attempts at rawness."
2,More hype,"Sorry to say, but this album is just not that great. Really. The songs are neither sad, aggressive, beautiful or catchy. The emotional tone is flat pretty much throughout. I was beginning to wonder when I saw on all the web sites that the lyrics were available, and thought ""What about the music?"" That's the problem; just cause she's a female singer/songwriter doesn't mean she's good! Everyone's just so desperate for an indie icon that Cat Power gets heaped with praise that's not deserved."
2,Why is this CD being pushed so much?,"Don't get me wrong, I'm as much for rewarding the independent spirit as the next guy, but please... This woman should be singing at a coffeehouse, not on a list posted by Amazon as being an essential of alternative rock. Her efforts, although heart-felt, are immature, and she sacrifices musicality for an ethereal bohemian sound which has been done better by so many. I'm less interested in her than finding out who she's been sleeping with to get this album promoted so well."
2,lacks imagination and soul,"While not averse to sparseness (love Lisa Germano, Ani Difranco) there needs to be some strong underlying talent that can capture the imagination. These guys don't seem quite up to the task (keep trying) :>)"
1,School Librarian,"Horrifyingly bad! Stay away from this CD! On the CD, it says original artists and original recordings, but it was so far from the truth. My mother, who was a young lady from this era, was severely disappointed by this drivel. The liner notes provide no original release or copyright dates on the songs, only the 2006 release date of this crap. The recordings are new, none are original; I don't know about the artists. What a rip off! Pay very close attention and read carefully before buying any CD, and look out for useful comments that will prevent this problem."
3,re-runs,"Don't get me wrong, I really like their sound. But I get tired of all the re-runs they record. I actually look for albums by the Ventures that have NEW material, not Walk Don't Run, Perfidia over and over again. I think their best albums were ""The Fabulous Ventures"" and ""The Ventures Play the Greatest Surfing Hits of all time"". We want NEW material, stop playing ""Walk Don't Run ""."
4,Strange album for a punk fan.,"I got the Colourtide as a gift for my birthday just after it was released last year. I'm mostly into Punk and Metal but occasionally find myself listening to Counting crows, Train and other more mellow bands. I thought this album was excellent. ""Shelter her from pain"" being my favourite song of the album. Very reminisent of another Irish band the Devlins at times but establishing itself as a very different album. If you like mellow chill out rock with a little splash of electronica then this is the album for you."
2,Blue Nile fans BEWARE!,"I bought this CD to get a new take on some classic Blue Nile songs. Annie Lennox had done such a fabulous cover of ""Downtown Lights"" on her album ""Medusa"" that I wanted another fix since as we BN fans know, it's years between albums. Well, let me just say that during the version of ""Let's Go Out Tonight"", I found myself wincing! And a dance version of ""Saturday Night"". What was I thinking?!! If you're craving the Blue Nile, check out Chris Botti's ""Midnight Without You"". The Blue Nile are special guests on the title track, and I'm telling you this song would have been perfect on the ""Hats"" album."
4,Porsche 911 3.2 Carrera,"As the owner of one of the subject 911 3.2 Carreras, this is the most comprehensive book I've read on this car to date. Some of the descriptions of the car tends to make the author a master of the obvious but generally a good read. Coverage of special models within the range is very good with a fair amount of detail.Given the author lives in England, much of the info deals with cars in that market however, it does have plenty of references to and pictures of U.S. cars. The upside is that living on that side of the pond makes access to some of the people involved with the car and the company (Peter Schutz) possible.Option and color codes are provided as are production numbers broken down by year, body style and market.If you own one of these cars or are thinking about buying one, this is a good choice"
1,Deceiving,"This book, walking a thin line, doesnt have a real storie. It is a bunch of descriptions, and you always think that something may happen but nothing ever does... The book would have been better if the main rolde got annorexia nervosa and not her friend, because that is a problem and each book needs a problem, in this book there was no problem; only a girl complaining because of her weight.The book wasnt awful but even the end wasn't marvelous and you dont feel attached to the characters as you do in other books (Molly by any other name) The book has no punch line or something, its just so incredibaly deceiving when you have 4 pages left and still no sign of any sickness. The book was quite predictable. I do not suggest this book.Good-bye"
3,Could be better,"As a violinist, I am currently working on the Bach A minor. I got this CD hoping that it would help me out a bit. Well, I was very disappointed. The expression and interpretation is bland, and though I know this is a wonderful concerto, I wouldn't have guessed it from this recording."
1,Could have been great...,"Don't get me wrong, the idea behind this book is great. The idea of the Aquasilva world is amazing; the descriptions of the water-world are inspiring. But the telling of the story itself is HORRIBLE. The story-line is confusing, the supporting characters are cardboard, and the main character is your typical hero gifted with all-mighty superpowers. Several phrases are repeated ALL too often--phrases such as ""looked smart"" and ""waved cheerily"". I ""waved cheerily"" to this book as I threw it into the garabage. Trust me, if you want a good book, stick to David Edding's The Belgarion, or the Otherland series. Leave this one where you found it. On the shelf."
2,This book need some proof-reading,"While the story is halfway decent, this book really is in desperate need of some proof-reading to make sure that dates and facts match. The dialogue is wooden I can't imagine anyone ever speaking in the manner in which the characters of this novel speak."
1,"Oog. Well, I probably didn't write any better at 19 either.","I really like the cover. It's pretty. That's the most elegant part of the book. Several other reviewers have more eloquently expressed their distress over the plot and the writing style, so I'll narrow down on just one bit - the major love plot.The characters meet each other. They fight. Later, they have to pretend to be in love. They don't actually ever do that on screen, but maybe they're doing it between chapters or something. Then they have to fight some more. Then their companions remark that they must really be interested in each other. The main character decides that he must be, because other people noticed it. Of course, we the viewers have seen none of it. We've hardly even seen the fighting, it just gets mentioned constantly. Then they have a big fight.Oh, the romance. I can hardly stand it."
2,Bad Photo Copy,I gave this 2 stars. You can barley make out any of the photo copy images. The images look like black shadows and are useless.
4,singled out again,"I ended up buying all three series individually anyway, so this set is definitely a Deal. I bought the first series thinking Id fill out my collection of prison flicks and ended up buying them as they were each released on DVD. I gave this series 4 stars for its irritating menu selection of episodes, and no Play All option. Gritty and intense with strong sexual content, this is a definite repeat viewing."
5,"Required reading for any child ""labeled"" ADD or ADHD or any Teacher!","This book is incredible. All of my child's teachers wanted me to drug her to keep her in their style of learning ""box"". After reading this book, I found many tips and tricks to deal with her visual learning style and also it helped me to realize just how special she is!! It can be difficult raising a child who has been labeled ADHD but this book makes you realize how luck you are to have such a special child and that it isn't a bad thing, it's just different!This book should be required reading for ALL teachers and administrators!!"
4,Makes sense,"I'm a psychologist, and this book makes sense to me. Like the authors, I don't believe that ""behavior mod"" is the way to go with lots of kids - it treats them like machines...the behavioral model was originally designed in experiments with animals, and takes any ""human"" quality out. I also have a daughter who is having some behavior problems, and the book's approach works better with her than more ""traditional"" programs. I give the authors a lot of credit for going beyond the status quo in thinking how to work with a child."
1,Not all right-brained children have ADD,"I bought this title, as well as ""Upside-down Brilliance..""I could not find my child's traits in the ""RBCIALBW"" book because he does not meet the criteria for ADD.However, when I opened the ""Upside-down Brilliance"" book, I discovered ""him"" (and me!) on nearly every page. This book does include a section on ADD and the right-brained child, but the ""RBCIALBW"" does not separate the two.Had I not bought both books, I might not ever have discovered that my child is a VSL (Visual Spatial Learner), which is helping us a lot!These are two very different books!"
5,This book is a PARENTS BLEESING!!!! RECOMMEND HIGHLY !!,"I was so overjoyed at reading this book, that I literally went to my son's school, took him out of the classroom for a few minutes in the hallway and told him everything is going to be o.k because Mommy found a book to help him and I understood how he learns now much better!I then asked the teacher if he would mind a copy to read himself if I bought it. This teacher is one of those very special open-mined ones that is always trying to help his students in some way and he was very interested to have a copy.My son is not hyperactive, but was always having focusing problems and reading and writing since 2nd grade we were trying everything under the Sun to help him. This book is an ABSOLUTE BLESSING!!I too would love to get a copy in every teacher's hand to read.Every child is different and we need to help and UNDERSTAND their ways of learning!"
5,AWSOME!,"This book is a God send. When I started to read this book I couldn't stop. I finished it and immediately went out and bought the only two copies I could find to give to my son's teachers. I felt as though I was reading about my child in this book. I could relate to everything Mr. Freed was talking about. I tried the examples in the book and when my child spelled words I never heard of, both forward and backward, without skipping a beat, I cried. It still amazes me. After 6 long years of struggling with schools, homework, and conferences with school officials...a solution.Thank you for revealing what these children truly are...GIFTED. Mr. Freed and Laurie Parsons. You have given me hope. For that I can't thank you enough."
5,Excellent Book,"I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Everything made so much sense in relation to what we were noticing in our son. Starting in Preschool the teachers were hinting that he may have ADD. Now in Kindergarten we're hearing the same thing. At my first meeting with his teacher and the school's social worker I brought this book. The teacher loved it and the Social worker turned her nose up at it. I know in my heart my son doesn't have ADD he is just an intelligent visual learner. I wish Mr. Freed would write more and give parents more of this ammunition they need to help their kids. He's correct, there are more of these kids entering schools every year and the system needs to change. Is there any way to contact the author or Child advocate groups in the Boston area who support Jeffrey Freed's findings."
2,The best book on ADD,"Since my son was diagnosed 2 weeks ago I've been absorbing as much information as I can on ADHD. This book is the one (out of 5) that stands out the most so far. Freed hits the nail on the head with this book. There is potential and brilliance in these children that most schools (even the Montessori school my son is in) just don't know how to tap into. My son loves doing the reading, spelling and math exercises suggested. If you have a child with ADD/ADHD this book is a must!"
5,I now understand my children!,"I devoured this book because it revealed to me the whys of my kids (and myself): why they behave the way they do in school and at home, why they are taking interest in activities such as gymnastics and music, etc. I am recommending this book to all of my friends who have kids like ours and who are struggling in the private school setting in NYC. I thank the authors for their dedication to help right-brained people realize their potential. It's really refressing"
5,A positive and supportive guide to ADD,"Drawing on a wide range of expert opinion andhis own extensive experience, Freed with hisco-author presents a sensible portrayal ofthe ADD individual and other visual thinkers.He demonstrates how the schools frequently ig-nore the thinking and learning style of theADD student and help disable him. Practicalchapters on spelling, reading, writing, math,study and organizational skills, and class andschool placement provide straightforward waysto bring the strengths of ADD kids into theireducation and allow them to be successful.Concluding chapters discuss the use of drugsin limited ways and other treatments for ADD.This is a comprehensive, practical, wise, andvery supportive book."
4,"Good Advice, but...","I found many good ideas in this book, and I'll use them while tutoring children here in Mexico, but certain of the authors' views are either self-serving or putting a brave face on what he must realize is a very bad situation. The author states in various places that right-brained children are problem-solvers whose holistic ways of looking at things will lead us into the future. Perhaps so, but what problems will they choose to solve? The author himself describes these children as hypersensitive, overly competitive, impulsive self-gratifiers with poor social skills. Now that they're with us, it's our duty to help them as best we can, but it sounds to me as though the most likely future they will lead us into (especially if they're not helped) is social disintegration."
3,"Formerly 5-Star, Turned Anti-Christian and Pro Immorality","I'd highly recommend seasons 1 - 5, all the seasons before Sergeant Scott. These were highly entertaining, very typical British murder mysteries, in the spirit of the original books.Season 7 started poorly and finally got so bad with the 5th episote (The Straw Woman) that I'll not watch any further. The storyline is virtually always ""Christians hate homosexuals and they're all crazy Bible-thumping hypocrites."" I can take a bit of that because there are crazies everyplace, and it is, after all, a British murder mystery. But the story line has taken on the modern culture, where gay is the way and sexual immorality of all kinds is just fine, thank you.It's robbed these fine actors of a real story and made them mouthpieces for the writers of these screenplays.Sad. Angering, to be sure. Disappointing, if not surprising.I gave three stars only because it's mediocre--a prime example of the tripe we get over here on TV."
3,Useful,"There aren't many books out there for intermediate learners and I found this one useful for increasing vocabulary. (I have the book but not the cassettes). The long passages are good for reading through and practising pronunciation. On the other hand, the speaking style in the passages is unrealistic and the subject matter is very dated. The romanisation is workable but not quite in line with the modern Yale system and there are not many grammar drills. Only worth getting because of the lack of other teaching material at this level."
4,NC Listener,"I own four copies of this piece and agree with ""A Music Fan"" Had Kathleen Battle been Zerbinetta, it would have been a perfect set. Get the video, its better than all four of the versions. The four CD copies I have are conducted by Solti, Levine, Masur, and Nagano. Levine's video version outshines them all. Great primary soloists, great supporting cast. Outstanding!!!"
5,Fantastic...,"This album is superb. Rena is one of the most highly regarded producers of this genre (electro-acoustic). Her strings are fantastic- if you love strings like cellos and violins, but don't really care for the classical school of them, then this is for you. It's sort of like shpongle mixed with Tycho and a hint of Jamie Watts. This cd is very down-tempo and very real... there's just no other way to describe it."
2,Careful...,"Tarminator will remove tar, and much more if you let it. The directions say it is safe on paint and clearcoat, but it is not to be used on bare plastics (trim mouldings, headlights, etc). The passenger side of my car was coated with tar from road construction, so I bought some Tarminator to remove it. On the fenders and doors, the tar was remove with no problems. However when used on my side skirts, which are painted and clearcoated, it started to melt them. Be careful when using this stuff on any kind of plastic whether painted or not."
5,Best Tar Remover,This is the best Tar Remover I've come across. Very quick removal and no problems with residue.
5,"Lifetime (39 yrs.) of bookcollecting, selling and READING","I rarely underline/highlight the books I read, mainly Non-Fiction, and have quite a library myself thanks to working as a used book dealer. Many sit on my shelves going unread...(so many books, so little time)...this book is the exception. I've hi-lighted my favorite parts that i want to read and re-read, to let it sink in. I only mark in books I plan on getting more copies of, to give away/loan to friends and family. I've read escatalogical books since I was 10 or so, and few books have impacted me like The Mystery of Iniquity. Upon reading this book I was blown away/thrown for a loop. Aside from the Holy Bible, it's one of the best I've ever read! Get several copies!!! Nuff said.Charlie,""The Book Guy"""
5,The Mystery of Iniquity By the formost expert!!!,Michael Rood is the formost authority in the area of Hebrew history as it relates to Messianic understanding of the times we are living in! His eloquent mannerisms can be appreciated not only in his writings but even more in person. I have had the pleasure to hear him speak and recommend any of his materials and heart. Let it be known this man has been there and done that and is not only honored in America but in the Land of Israel and everywhere he goes.
1,Still Futurism,"The deception in this book is great, truth and a lot error.This is all ment to keep you from seeing the truth of a historical view and that most of prophecy is finished, not yet to come as Futurism holds. I do not think he knows what he is doing or that he is decived himself.He will lead you under the Law if you let him. For even the Talmud teaches to hate the Christians because they followed a New Law ""NOT"" the Law in the Old Testament ""Hilkhoth Teschuhah (111,8)"" In this book he speaks of a Conspirasy, but maybe not telling you all the truth is more like it.In short I do not recommend this book at all."
3,What if he's right?,"I disagree with the first review. Long held beleifs are never easy to part with. Be that as it may, to dismiss this book as heresy is ridiculous. Mr. Rood's erudition and earnestness are obvious, and he has provided many, many compelling evidences to back his theory. If this book does not persuade you to give up your long held, traditional ideas pertaining to the rapture and the tribulation, it will definitely persuade you to do a close reading of the scriptures, and that is a very good thing.Finally, if Mr. Rood is correct, isn't the reaction of reader #1 exactly what one would expect?"
3,Mystery of Iniquity,Book was good... the binding of the book was in excellent condition. Book was marked up and highlighted pretty badly. Alot of notes in the book that have nothing to do with the book. book said excellent condition but i would say it was in fair condition.
5,A veil has been lifted from my eyes!,"Michael Rood opens your eyes, and makes you see the truth instead of the lies we have inherited. Read what he has to say, and research it. This book will start you on a path to salvation. Read it if you are ready to change your life for our Creator and Savior."
5,Great little pump/siphon,"Don't waste your money on cheaper pumps they just don't work. It's made well and it works well. I just drained the gas tank on my generator and it took only a few minutes. The pump has a large stroke volume, which cuts the time down. The unit comes with a quantity of clear large diameter hose that you can cut to suit your application. It's a must have in the garage."
3,Beckson 109PC,I've used the product several times - the fluid being extracted flows as expected when I am manually using the pump - once the pump stops the flow stops. I've read the directions and have placed the pump handle in several positions but the results are the same.
1,Useless,"This pump leaked from the very first use. Since we intended to use it for gasoline, the leaks were too dangerous. It has found an appropriate home in the county landfill."
5,Exactly as described,I haven't used it yet but I plan to use it for transfering fuel from containers to my personal generator.
3,Siphon-mate,"This is a very simple product, but it works very well. It shipped when promised, and was received on time."
1,Beckson 109PC Siphon-Mate Transfer Pump,Tried to transfer some gas from my vehicle to a 1 gallon gas tank. Despite repeated attempts it didn't work. Waste of money.
1,Didn't work,Tried to transfer some gas from my vehicle to a 5 gallon gas tank. Despite repeated attempts it didn't work. Waste of money.I have been told that some modern gas tanks have anti-siphon limiters. Is this true ?
2,Had to glue the barrel to the top.,"Tried the pump out and it was drawing air in at where the gray barrel meets the black plastic outlet and pumping water out. I superglued it and that fixed the air/water leak and now the pump works fairly well. If you have superglue around then this might be a good pump for various uses. I had to pump out a cover that filled with water and you can start pumping with this transfer pump and if you can put the hose lower than the water, it will then self-siphon. I had planned on transferring fuel from one boat to another and glad I pumped water first. With the leak I would have had fuel spraying out of the leak and that could have been dangerous. Considering the price, this is a really cheaply made transfer pump. I would also strongly recommend trying the pump out with water first before ever transferring any flammable liquids."
3,"Good plot, but too drawn out","Now that you've gotten the drift of the movie plot (that of a panicked mother looking for her lost child) I can only say that I found the pacing of the movie way too slow. I would think that a truly excited, panicked mother would have everyone around her excited, if not screaming, too. These people all act as if they're on Xanax. None of them seem to identify with this young worried mother, even the couple with two intrusive kids in the seat ahead.And Foster herself doesn't seem all that troubled to me. Yes, she goes through the motions, but she's way too controlled to be that worried over losing a 6 year old. I know how I'd be if I lost my 6 year old!In short, the pacing of the movie was just too long and drawn out to sustain the suspense factor. A good effort by Jodie Foster, but not one of her best."
2,Too bad...,"...they didn't get a real director to try getting this worthy of being viewed, especially with such a cast..... I strongly suggest Mr. Robert Schwentke looks for some other work he could do (if there is) because I don't think any apprenticeship will be of any use in this kind of line for him...."
2,Script lifted verbatim from Love In A Mist,Grasso writes with great style but should give her readers more respect. I was disappointed to read a lot of the same script I just had read in Love In A Mist. I would have given more stars for originality. (D. Bowen
4,Foxmask - Wolfskin - loved them both,"I think both Foxmask and Wolfskin are great books - yes there are parts that are slow in each book and parts that are predictable in each book - however, that happens a lot with any book. They are both fine pieces of writing and I enjoy this author's work and research to make these books so enjoyable.Foxmask's characters are strong - you either love them or hate them. Creidhe is a strong heroine. I enjoyed reading about her immensely. She did compare somewhat to the Sevenwaters women, in her own way. However, I really think she made a name for herself.I enjoyed the book and I'm sure anyone who likes this author or historical fiction will, too."
5,Courage,"Unlike the first book of this series, This book was alot more to my liking. It was truley an amazing experience."
4,Seemed to dark and brooding.,"I LOVE Juliet Marillier's writing. This was a very well written story with well established and full bodied characters. I was overall very impressed with the story, but I did think it seemed even darker that her other books. Maybe just a little too dark for me."
5,More real than real.,"This is raw and authentic with no retakes. They recorded live. It's as if you are there in the house with a bowl of gumbo on your lap.It is performed by Cajun Creole musicians living in Louisiana playing on authentic instruments and performing traditional Cajun Creole French songs. Goldman Thibodeaux and D'Jalma Garnier are considered masters of the genre. Goldman plays Cajun accordian and D'Jalma plays Creole fiddle. Both sing.""The authentic Cajun and Creole culture and traditional folk music is alive and well in southwest Louisiana, Cajun country called Acadiana. Accept no imitations when so much of the real thing is available. Yes, people still speak French in Acadian Louisiana.""The music makes you feel whole and alive."
2,Theres only one reason for 2 stars,The reason i'm giving it two stars is because my friend actually liked the lipstick. But it is in fact a fake knock off. This is a scam and the formula for these are all wrong. Though it states it's a M.A.C. Product it is not one bit. Do not buy unless you are prepared for the fact that it is not a legit M.A.C. Product.
4,Essential Dog Book,"If you're considering a purebred dog, make sure you check out these books by Dr. Bruce Fogle. They're full of up to date info and colour photos. The profile on the Labrador Retriever features information on general care, feeding, training, grooming, and exercise."
4,An Informational Labrador Book,"This book is very helpful when it comes to learning about and understanding this intelligent breed. This book covers the following subjects: Puppy Care, Adult Care, Feeding and Food, Grooming, Health, Breeding, Showing, the Working Dog, and a special chapter called ""The Dog For You"", which introduces you to the Labrador breed. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering or already owns a Lab."
3,The clear case doesn't come with it,"I don't know whose fault it is, but Amazon has problem with posting pictures in the product section, when in fact it doesn't come with it. The PSP UMD cases that arrived was what it was, and good product. But the clear case that is in the pictures DOES NOT come with the whole thing. I was disappointed because that was mainly why I bought this product.Anyway, the UMD case is cool how it has to section to it, a place to put 3 UMDs on the front, and place to put 2 pro duo memory sticks on the back. Both opening swivels, which makes it more cooler. The swivels has locks too after you open it to certain point. Down point would be having to take everything out when what you want is at the bottom of the case."
1,Should be better,"The musical selections are wonderful. The orchestra is fine. What could be wrong? Well, for one thing, Ms. Rivera, the featured violinist, has great difficulty playing in tune. Musicians in my household couldn't bear to listen to her."
3,huh?,"I was under the impression this album was their unique remix. It is not. It is just a compilation of their favorite artists that Nick Rhodes spinned records of during his dj days. The only thing unique about this album are the photo graphs. You can make a playlist of these easily acquired songs.If you are a Duran, John Taylor, or Nick Rhodes fan, you can't help but have this to your collection.However, it was disappointing."
4,EXCELLENT LOOK AT CONTINUITY OF SAGE IN OLD & NEW TESTAMENTS,"Ben Witherington III has contributed a marvelous work to the study of one of the key, yet obscure leadership roles in Scripture. While we often think of kings, priests, and prophets in the Old Testament, this book gives the reader some very convincing proof of the sage's crucial role in leading and influencing society. With great skill (and tremendous footnotes!) the author weaves the sage's role from Old Testament, through the inter-testamental period, and climaxes with the picture of Jesus as Sage. But he doesn't stop there and adds several New Testament persons to the list of those we can consider ""sage."" For anyone looking to deeply study the role of sage and the nature of divine wisdom would spend their money wisely in getting this book."
5,Another Fabulous Volume From Mr. Perry,"Joel Perry's ""That's Why They're In Cages, People!"" is further proof that Mr. Perry is one of our premiere essayists. Alternately funny, moving, and thought-provoking (and sometimes combinations of all three), this latest collection is a delight for anyone who enjoys good writing."
4,Confused,"The book was fascinating. It begins in the early 1940's in Chicago. Seth is a retarded young Jewish man. He is befriended by Robert Adams,a Black man who accepts him as a person, not a retarded person. The story is Seth's story. The varied and colorful people in his life, his experiences and how those around him are changed by him. He marries Robert's daughter Arley, and they go to live with her relatives in Vergennes, Ill. Seth seeks employment to work at the coal mine, entirely run by coloreds. It is a story of Seth's transformation from being retarded to being called by God (reluctantly) and becoming a leader. The language and some of the situations are are not only exreme, but bizarre. The story seems to encompass so many different levels, but I was disappointed in the ending,....or didn't understand the ending. However, I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a ""good"" read. It's touching, it's spiritual and it's shocking!"
1,Over the top preachy,"As a card-carrying feminist, I bought this book for my five year old daughter who, to my horror, is enamored with all things princess. I wanted her to have some positive, empowering messages about being a girl, to counter-act the passive princess characters who only find happiness when a man bestows it on her by choosing her as his bride. But this book is so over the top preachy that I can't even bear to give it to her because that means I'll have to read it again. The Princess Knight, The Paper Bag Princess and Princesses aren't Quitters are much better options in my opinion."
5,one of the year's best,"Eclectic, unpredictable, inspired. What DYI and emo were before the terms were co-opted and the sound homogenized. Am looking forward to her upcoming work, esp. the country album."
2,My corgi does not like this,I bought this product due to its good review in Amazon for my welsh corgi dog. My corgi doesn't like this product at all as he trying to spit out this product when I applied to him. I can not really blame the product; I think it all depends on the dog itself.
2,Dogs miss there Four Paws toothpast.,"The reviews sounded great on this item, however I knew the only review that matters is that of my bubbies. So far, after a couple of weeks, they are still not thrilled with it. They used to come to the bathroom and wait to have their teeth brushed, now I must play hide and seek with them."
1,Does contain a DANGEROUS toxin!,"I looked at the manufacturer's web site before purchasing this product and discovered that this toothpaste contains propolyne glycol. In laymans language, THAT IS ANTIFREEZE. As we all know, antifreeze/glycol KILLS all animals (including us) if ingested. There are other dog toothpastes that do NOT contain this TOXIC ingredient, so I would purchase those products even if this product was offered to me for free."
2,Good for students,"This book is recommended for college students who can do their projects in LabVIEW without formal training.But, LabVIEW 8.6 is quite different from previous and the material needs updation"
4,A Very Interesting Story,"A Bayport art-collector, Raymond Wester, suspects Frank and Joe of stealing one of his paintings, but offers them the chance to prove their innocence, so Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff head to Smuggler's Cove in the Florida Keys to track down the painting and the real thieves. Lots of action, suspence and a good plot. I enjoyed the book very much. My only problem with the story was that if Wester truely believed that Frank and Joe were guilty, why would he let them leave Bayport?"
5,Filling a niche,"As a tracker, I find this book to be an invaluable reference. I have long thought that there was a need for this type of book as bird tracks have not been the focus of past tracking books. I find the illustrations and photos clearly laid out and easy to use to see details. There are sections on feathers, nests, feeding signs, skulls, scat, and more. I highly recommend this book to all trackers and naturalists and anyone who wants to be more aware of the world of nature around them. No other skill can give you that awareness of the natural world. This book will help you on your way to being a better tracker."
1,"Love Toby, Disappointed in DVD","I made the mistake when I pre-ordered the DVD that it would contain some of his newer videos so despite it being vintage Toby, I was looking for ""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue"",""Who's Your Daddy?"" and ""I Love This Bar""--lesson learned."
2,Toby Keith DVD,"This could have been so good it's ashaimed,He left out all the best vidios.I realy was dissapointed.I thought I would get,The angry american or beer for my horses.Or even I love this bar or look at me now or who's your daddy? But I got none of these.this was designed to start a series of collections.these were supposed to be the best of his videos instead it turned out to be his worst.Maybe the next one will be better."
5,Balanced and fair.,"This documentary is one of a kind. The subject of Neanderthals, and whether they died out or were bred out, is an extremely controversial subject. It is controversial primarily because no Neanderthal fossils have ever been found in Africa. Hence, while scientists will never come out and say so plainly, which ever side of the argument turns out to be correct has monumental implications regarding the equality, or inequality, of the races of mankind.This PBS Nova documentary manages to present all sides of the debate in a fair and balanced manner.By the way, if you want to see what an totally biased treatment of the subject looks like, view the Discovery Channel's ""The Last Neanderthal""."
1,Complete nonsense,"Typical of postmodern ""theory,"" the writing is needlessly complex, which, also typical of postmodernists, hides the fact that the author is substantively ignorant of the topic and has no insight to offer. If you can sort through the jargon, this book basically argues that serial murders would not happen if we just ignored the killers, because they are part of a ""discursive"" loop, in which the killers are a sort of performer who kill to please their audience, which is the public. The author is oblivious to work done in psychology, criminology, sociology, and FBI investigations. Overall, the book is a flight from reality, which would be humorous if the topic were not so serious."
1,Poor quality product,I purchased a pair of these mirrors for towing our camper. When traveling at 55mph the vibration was to great to see clearly. One of the mirrors had two defects in the glass and after 2 or 3 weeks the rubber straps start to crack and deteriorate. I feel this product was not worth the money.
3,Towing Mirror,"The Reese Towpower 72787 Clip-on Towing Mirror is not as good as I would have wanted. It is ok for the low price, but if I were to do it again, I would spend more on a sturdier towing mirror"
4,Decent,It's not great but it will get the job done. I had to put a stocking over it and it worked fine.
3,"A GOOD POP FILTER, BUT DANGEROUS !!!","It does a great job as far as handling your pop and pushing the direction downward, but, it has a design flaw in my opinion. I took some duct tape to try to cover the raw edge that may cut some ones face if you become distracted, I'm searching for a more attractive solution to that problem. This products flexible placement arm is too weak, that makes it hard to stay in place, I cut a hanger and inserted it within the tube of the flexible arm to try and strengthen it. Depend on the temperature of the room, the duct tape doesn't stick very well, or, very long."
4,Salt Cellar,Not exactly what I wanted but a great buy for the price. Works just fine for kosher salt next to my range. Makes me feel like a chef.
1,Not as Pictured,"I received the Salt Keeper very quickly, but was very unahppy with what I received and will be returning it. It has a big screw in the top of the lid, holding it to the bottom. Not at all what is pictured. No rounded edges and smells of oil. This is the first pruchase from Amazon that I have NOT been happy with."
2,Not as pictured,"The wood itself appeared to be nice but (as mentioned before) there is a large (unsightly) screw on the lid. I did not think that it swiveled very well at all either. Kudos to Amazon for an easy return, but it isn't as pictured."
1,Visible screw,"I was very disappointed. The picture on the web page did not indicate a screw head showing on the lid of the salt box! There was no time to return the item, and I didn't feel as though I should/could pay for return shipping! VERY disappointed!!!"
1,should have read reviews before ordering.,"This isn't at all like the one shown. Don't believe it is ironwood, as it is marked acacia wood. No sheen no gloss at all - don't bother."
3,it works......,"as a lanyard to hold mp3 players this is a great little product. the sound is of adequate quality. the issue i have is the earphones do not fit very tightly so when you are in a loud environment, you really have to press the phones into your ears and hold them. this may be the mp3 players fault, but the phones could have more padding to fit more securely. overall i am happy with the purchase. the shipping was quick and was not misrepresented in advertising."
1,design problem,After 2 months of operation the undersized plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor have borken. This renders the shaver useless. It may be covered by the warranty but upon close inspection this is really a design issue. The tabs are not durable. I am sending the compelete package to the Spectrum Brands (Remingtons parent company) CEO for his use.
1,"Cut well, breaks often","I bought the shaver at the beginning of April. It did a great job of cutting.Within a month the plastic tabs in the head assembly broke. The customer service rep indicated that I was not doing anything wrong and sent me a replacement piece.Two months later it broke again. This time the rep had me send the unit in for repair. I sent it via priority mail. Remington now says the unit never arrived, and that I am out a shaver."
1,Shaves well but poorly designed shaver head,"I bought this shaver about 6 months ago. After two months the plastic tabs that secure the head to the razor broke and this rendered the shaver useless. I called the customer service, they sent me a new shaver within days (impressive). I was very careful with it but after 3 months the same exact problem happened again. I called them again and they shipped me a new head to the shaver in no time. The new head broke this time after only 1 week. There is definitely a design defect..."
2,It figures,"Bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. Just had to call Remington to have a replacement part sent. If the quality of the products was as good as the quality of customer service, there wouldn't be any problems. The lady from CS that I dealt with was great. She didn't ask for proof of purchase date, just said that the new part would be sent out tomorrow. I like that. Hopefully, this new part will not break. Other than the breakage issue, my hubby really likes how the razor shaves."
2,"Breaks easily, cuts poorly. Stay away.","I've had this for 2 months now. I was impressed with the cleaning system and it has an excellent battery life. In use, it takes a long shave requiring multiple passes to achieve good results. It now has a broken latch that secures the head; It only uses 2 very small catches to hold it in place, and even with gentle handling breaks easily. Stay away from this unit."
1,I miss my Braun,"After many years of reliable service, the battery on my Braun razor finally could not hold a charge. I received the Remington MS 900 as a gift and it worked for about 2 weeks before the infamous ""broken head tabs"" problem. Stay away.It cracks me up that people give this product 5 stars with reviews like ""works great until it breaks."" The point of these reviews is to help others avoid your mistakes. It is as if folks need to reassure themselves that they made an excellent purchase --except that it was a bad product. Silly."
1,Don't buy it-discontinued because of constand problems,"This is the worst shaver I have ever owned. I loved it when I firlst got it. It provided a good shave. Problem is the top foil piece has tabs that keep breaking. I have owned this shaver for 1.5 years and went through 4 of these. They break when you use the cleaner. Also the base cracked on the bottom so the cleaning fluid all leaks out. I called them again as it has a 2 year warranty and they said it has been discontitued (i'm sure it's becuase they can't afford to keep them running for the whole 2 year warranty period) and they said they would replace it with the f710 model. Dont buy one, you will be sorry!"
1,Poor design - close shave,"I received this shaver as a Christmas gift about 6.5 months ago. I can honestly say that I have never had a closer shave, but the shaver is not without its caveats. To begin with, the original charging base never quit flashing, indicating that the shaver was not fully charged. I called the company and the customer service representative was friendly but not knowledgeable. She thought that the base was probably OK until I pointed out the correct operation of the base in the shaver's handbook. I was told that a base would be shipped to me and that I was to return the original base in the box in which I received the new base. I was also told that I would be reimbursed for shipping though I was not. Then, after a few months of blissful shaves, one side of the screen would not stay attached to the shaver, rendering the shaver useless. I give up. I will use a blade until my new Braun arrives and I will not be going back to Remington."
2,Base Cracked,"I bought this thinking it would be easy to keep clean. Well, within 3 months the base that holds the cleaning fluid cracked and leaked out. Impossible to find replacement parts for the ""Cleaning Base"", now it is just another run of the mill, hard to clean, electric razor. Wish I had my money back. No more Remingtons for me."
1,This is one flimsy shaver,I bought the Remington ms 900 about 3 or 4 months ago. The tabs that hold the foil head to the shaver broke and it is useless. Appears to me a design flaw after reading all the other negative reviews from folks with the same problem. Fortunately I bought mine very cheap on sale as it is so flimsy I don't want it fixed or replaced. I just want it gone. Will go back to a good blade razor and forget I ever heard of Remington.
1,Avoid this one,"This shaver is a dud. The tabs break that secure the plastic head that holds the foil rendering the shaver useless. Remington sent me a new foil and plastic head with no questions asked. While that was nice, it indicates their ful knowledge they have a defective product in the market. As close as a blade? No way. It takes many passes to get a reasonably close shave. I have resorted to one final pass with a dry blade to finish what I expected this shaver to do. The cleaning base leaks fluid so that's useless as well. Do not buy this shaver. You will most likely regret it."
1,Avoid this product,"I received an MS-900 as a gift. Shortly after, the base started leaking. I called for a replacement, which was sent. In fact, since I asked for a replacement for the $5 bottle of cleaner, they just sent an entire new unit. Within a couple of months of that, the head would no longer stay on. I went back to the first shaver with the new base. Within a couple weeks, the head wouldn't stay on. Called Customer Service and they said they'd send me a different model. Sent a F-720. This one is not self-cleaning and only has two heads. Though a price check reveals that the suggested retail price is higher, it sure does look, feel, and shave like an inferior product.Next time I need one, I'm going back to Braun. Had one of their recharables for over 10 years until the battery would no longer hold a charge. I should have kept it and used it with a cord; would have been better than these Remington products.Oh; by the way, neither of these shavers gives a very good shave."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product is a very poor design. The plastic feet on the hair catcher break early and often. At first they had great customer service but lately they seem to be ignoring me. If you like stuff that breaks this is for you. They should have a ""0"" star rating this product doesnt even deserve a ""1""."
4,basic info,How to use Diamond Abrasives to Cut Gemstones .. Good basic information for the beginner. I would recommend this book
4,good and weird; but MUST HAVE for mil sci fi fans,"Care to romp through Byzantine history? Think Darth Vader is a wuss, and prefer your evil on steroids? Do you enjoy coarse humor and useful coincidences? Do you agree that horses are not built by Yamaha and that medieval combat is not something you can crib from the nearest Dungeons and Dragons gaming book? You'll love this book. The combination of Drake and Flint is jarring; vicious firefights and sardonic humor? I'm not sure if I like it; guess I'll have to read it again. (smile) There's little closure to the novel, and the outcome is far too obvious. Sequelae, anyone?"
4,"Not bad, and historically fairly accurate",This gives you a fair idea of what the man was like who was probably the best general of an empire that was noted for producing competant generals. A good read tho the Sci-fi element is a little silly. (mind reading cyrstals? please...)
2,Very Oblique Approach,"As a HUGE fan of David Drake, I eagerly anticipated reading this novel. Unfortunately, I was left sadly disappointed. While there were moments of brilliance, I felt the battle scenes stagnant, the characters one dimensional, and the plot irritating and ponderous. It seemed to be a fluffy version of the General series set during the Roman era. The writing style was so mundane that those expecting a David Drake military experience should not waste their money. His name might be on the cover, but the book was definitely not his."
4,"Good story, fun characters.","A good story with fun characters. It takes a while to get submerged into the world since it is so different from ours, but it's worth the effort.Solid story telling, characters you can care about, good foreshadowing make this a worth while reading.I enjoyed it, and want to read the following books."
4,"Great characters, lots of fun. Where is the rest of it?","Interesting characters, great battles, and lots of potential. But, if this is the whole story, I feel cheated. There is nothing at the end of the book to indicate a sequel to finish the great start."
4,Never judge a book by its cover,"Too often I've picked up what looked like a good novel, and have been disappointed. I remember a WWII novel covered with rave reviews, but started off as pureil trash and went downhill.I picked up ""Oblique Approach"" expecting a David Drake type SciFi quick read, shallow and fun. Much to my surprise this book turned out to be much more than its cover or authors would indicate. This may well have been Drake's way of saying that he can do better than potboilers. It may be that he and Eric Flint are natural collaborrators.Whatever the reason, this is a book chuck full of history, geography, culture, combat, intrigue, complex characters and good old fashioned SciFi and a great read. My only gripe is that now that I've read the first book, I've got to read the series."
5,Highly recommended by Stern's Management Review,"The thrust of this book is to help facilitate organizational change through finding more courage both within yourself and inspiring it in others. The author's aim is to help the reader find 1) more candor to deal with the truth, 2) a greater sense of purpose, 3) a more optimistic will, 4) more disciplined rigor, and 5) a greater inclination to trust and risk. These are five quintessential dimensions of courage that bring people to cross an action threshold and persevere. Each of these factors is explored in separate chapters; specific how-to guidelines are presented and summarized. The book vividly deals with the emotions underlying the will to act; it is insightful and invigorating. We highly recommend it."
4,Oddkins,I previously purchased (several years ago) the Oddkins for my son. He is an artist and the art work is what first caught my attention. Dean R. Koonts is one of my favorite writers. The first book I read was the Watchers and then Lightning - which I've red dozens of times. My only disappointment was that I thought it was a hardback instead of paperback.Great shipper - very speedy. thanks!
3,Review of Strick's Portrait,"This film is a much better attempt at filming Joyce than was the 1967 ""horror of a film"" Ulysses. Here, Strick has come closer to filming the internal thoughts of Joyce's characters. The film itself looks great,I feel. He did a good job of lining up shots that corespond to what one might imagine in the novel. However, the acting was not as good. Perhaps now something as this just seems dated. Who knows? I would hope someone today would want to attempt this again. Overall, better that Ulysses. Another great attempt at filming the works of our centuries most intellegent man. For anyone wanting to expand their view and inturpretation of the novel, this film is a must see."
3,Useful introduction to Joyce,"This is not a great film, but at only 90 minutes it does serve as both a digestible and intelligible introduction to the work of James Joyce.There is not much action or cinematographic inspiration--instead what you have is almost a filmed reading of highlights from the book performed by a good group of actors.The uninitiated should be aware that they need at least some background knowledge about the situation in Ireland in the late 19th century to understand what is going on: the struggle for self-government and the stifling pervasiveness of the Roman Catholic Church.All that said, if this film wets your appetite then you are ready to proceed further into the Joycean world. Otherwise, you are best advised to stay clear with the satisfaction of knowing thay you at least looked into the subject."
4,"Not the Greatest, just special ...","The case on this calendar said exactly what it was upfront. It was not meant to be a list of the greatest movies ever made. In fact, it gave the movies it discussed a rating from 4 ""bones"" (including halves) all the way down to ""WOOF!"". It points out movies that are unique or worth seeing for one reason or another. After all, who wants a list of the same thing you see everywhere else? Do I need to be told that Schindler's List was a 4-star movie yet again?? No, but a mention of ""The Fast Runner"" because it was the first Inuktitut-language feature film was something you might not read elsewhere. I just hope I can find a similar calendar for 2006."
1,CD is not what it's cracked up to be,"I bought this CD thinking the songs were the original recordings, which they are not. I ordered it from Import CD Specialists. Once I had received it and discovered it was not worth having, Import CD Specialists refused to allow me to return it. Don't buy this CD and don't buy anything from Import CD Specialists as they will rip you off. Also, be very careful about anything you buy from the Amazon website as it may not be what you think it is."
4,One of the best Sci-Fi series ever,I am a fairly frequent watcher of sci-fi shows and movies. I believe that Babylon 5 is one of the best written and best acted sci-fi shows out there. I especially recommend seasons 2-4 as very dramatic and well written.
3,What's up with the price?,"why is this box set over $400, and i don't see anything listed as different or 'bonus feature' whereas if i just bought each season independently the total is almost half the cost...."
2,Babylon 5 box set,"If you are a B5 fan and know the movies you would know upon playing the first episode that not only are they not in order they arent complete. As having been a avid collector i nearly had the original B5 collection on VHS and i can tell you this is one of the worst compilations i have seen. i purchased mine thru best buy and bought all 5 seasons.That was 250 dollars wasted. If you havent seen B5 this is a chance for you to see them ,however do not get your hopes up about it being a complete series.The original first episode DID not have Ivanova on the show that part was played by a very beautiful oriental lady....thta wasnt even included.So how are you to understand whats goin on if you dont have the very first episode, or any sembelance of order to them. Im sorry but i am very disappointed in this set."
5,One of the best Sci-Fi series ever,"This is one of the best Science Fiction series ever made. It has great action, deep character development, and epic storytelling creating its own heroes and mythology. The acting starts off pretty poorly in the first season, but the bad actors are replaced with better ones in the second season and a lot of the actors improve over time as they meld with their characters."
4,Great series,"I don't watch a lot but this is probably the best Sci-Fi series I've ever seen. There is a complex story-arc with a clean ending (as opposed to show that just drag on season after season until they get bad enough to be cancelled). It's not perfect, though: the special effects are a little low-budget (but hey, this is 15 years old so you've got to give them a little bit of a break) and some of the acting is pretty bad. The last season was a little awkward; it almost seemed like an add-on after the main story thread had been resolved. Still, overall, I've loved this series and would highly recommend it to any Sci-Fi fan.Recommended."
2,"Great show, lousy picture quality and packaging","I have been a huge fan of Babylon 5 since I first saw ""The Gathering"". I was hoping that Warner Brothers would come out with a complete boxed set like they did in England, but since they had no intention of doing this, I got the complete series and the movie collection. Big Mistake! I actually am looking forward to the new DVD formats (HD DVD or Blu Ray) so I can replace this set.Picture Quality: I own several other Warner TV series on DVD and have always found them to have high picture quality. This series has fuzzy and out of focus scenes throughout and the prints used to master the DVD have scratches in virtually every episode. I have watched episodes of the series online and even the low bandwidth version has better picture quality.Bad Packaging: The DVDs are held in place by plastic inserts that are glued to cardboard. These are not well secured and have fallen apart.Think twice before buying."
4,"Great series, awful packaging","This, to me, is the best Sci-Fi show ever made (Firefly and Trek enthusiasts, feel free to disagree!). It comes off even better when watched on DVD on a modern HDTV and with 5.1 sound than it did when originally broadcast. Of course, the quality of the video and the sound isn't up to today's standards, but the story remains fabulous. The audio levels are sometimes inconsistent, which can be annoying, but that is fairly minor.The way the disks are packaged is awful - the hinges on these plastic multi-dvd cases break, and you end up with a bunch of loose disk holders rattling around. Not really a big deal, but annoying.Overall, this is a good deal, though, and B5 is really worth owning."
2,B5-TV Series,"I gave this 2 stars because Amazon promptly refunded my money back for the purchase as well as the shipping. The quality of the DvDs was terrible. They were all scratched up and 3-4 ofthe episodes on disk 2 and 3 either froze up when I played them or skipped. If your going to get the series, I recommend going to a book store and buying one season at a time instead of all of them together. I did that and the quality was 100 times better."
3,Satisfied,"I am satisfied with my purchase. My family and I enjoyed watching them over the holidays. A few of the DVD's were scratched and had not come loose from the carrier so that was a little disheartening. They play, but skip a bit. Other than that there has been no problems. I got them quickly and it was packaged well."
2,Better Remembered than Rewatched,"File Babylon 5 as one of those shows that is better to remember than to rewatch. I bought this as a diversion while recoverying from spine surgery, and despite a valiant effort on my part, quit before getting to the end of the first season. There are a few loveable characters, but mostly the acting is bad, bad, bad and the special effects are cheesy. Well remembered as a decent show in its day, but does not stand the test of time."
3,Babylon 5 DVD's,I bought the complete series after receiving Season One as a gift. I was very disappointed with the quality of the series' DVD's compared to the Season One. Some parts of the disks would not even work on my DVD players. I would look elsewhere to purchase any other DVD's in the future.
4,How can nearly every nerd in america be wrong?,"B5 is a good answer to the question ""What if"". Gripping story lines, captivating visuals, endearing characters and a setting that begs, ""havoc come hither"". How can you go wrong?"
4,Good series,"I liked it on TV, and I like it now.I need more words to complete this review, so I added this sentence."
4,B5 - Entertainment with a Long View,"Well-written, with well-developed characters (none too ""perfect"" to seem real)and a very believable portrayal of both interpersonal and inter-group behavior."
1,"Another batch of defective dvds-could they be ""knock offs""?","This is the second time I've been ripped off by low priced products. The first one was ""Young Indiana Jones-the Complete Series."" They turned out to be ""Chinese Knockoffs"" of the absolute worst quaility and were almost unviewable. This time it is ""Babylon Five: The Complete Seasons 1-5."" I gave it one star because zero stars are not available. I can't fault the reseller (he is new and was unrated)- he's bent over backwards to replace the faulty ones as I find them. I've found six out the first sixteen to be bad. It just takes a long time to view these ""Compete Series."" I'm holding out on reviewing the reseller until I'm completely through watching the entires series of dvds and see if he continues to replace the bad dvds. Please follow the old sayings-""Buyer Beware"" and ""You Get What You Pay For."" I'm now rethinking my decision on getting rid of cable and the dish. All resellers are hurt by these inferior products."
1,disappointed,I never got the dvd set I ordered.I ask for them.Was told to ask again or request a refund.never got the dvds. Will not know if I got credit until I get my credit card statement.I am very disappointed in Amazon and I am not sure I will do business with amazon again. David
2,Lowbrow Science fiction,Why would anyone waste their time on this mediocre-at-best television show? It is science fiction for those with training wheels. Science Fiction for those who probably thought Lost in Space was a good science fiction program. Maybe the fans of this show should try READING science fiction or upgrade to watching Star Trek reruns!
2,Watch STAR TREK instead...,"B5 had an interesting yet unoriginal premise for a show. The acting was nothing spectacular and the plots needlessly elaborate. The makeup and sets were decent. However, the extreme use of action sequences (which were brilliant no doubt) took away from the story. Better to watch Star Trek (Original, Next Generation or DS9) where the characters and plot tell the story. Or the X-Files for Earth-based sci-fi, or Hercules or Xena for fantasy."
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Peppermints in the Parlor is a terrific book! As a young girl Emily Luccock lost both of her parents. She went to live with her aunt and uncle in their mansion, Suger Hill Hall. But when she arrives at the house, everything is not as she expects. Two stange and mean women, strange shodows in the parlor, and the mansion darker and gloomier than ever! And most of all where is her Uncle Twice, and why does Aunt Twice seems to be a prisoner in her own house?I loved this book from the very first page, to the very last! I reccomend this book to everyone to read! (It's a great book to use for a book report!!)"
5,I'm Going To Carry It Around LIke A Three Year Old,"That's what my grandson said when he got it for his birthday (he was seven). He loved it. It is ""squishy"" soft and the boy loves walruses for some reason. It was a hit. What more can I say. I have to admit that its an accurate replica of a walrus as a toy."
4,A mirror image of the artists view,I think my students will love traveling in the footsteps of the impressionists. Seeing what the artists saw is worth a 1000 words in explaining they why of the subject painted.
3,small book of Impressionists walking tours,"Interesting read. Focusing on Manet, Caillebotte and Monet, this small book is too confusing for a pocket guide as I was hoping. The left page gives anecdotes and historical notes plus suggestions for restaurants, while the right-hand page continues with the narrative of the tour. The information is great; layout is not."
4,Get Ripped,This is the usual non-stop program of kicking/punching/combo-routines that Billy Blanks is known for. I love the intense moves as there are no long periods of recovery (2 mins each max). This is definately for someone who's done other Tae Bo workouts and either wants to challenge themselves or continue with advanced routines that last up to approx 60 mins.
1,Taebo,"This is not the Billy Blanks workout I wanted. I wanted his Taebo I and Taebo II that shows him in the red outfit. He does a long workout and has an 8-minute workout at the end of the tape. There is a basketball star in the back row exercising with him and others. I have an old, old copy that is about to quit working. It is not rewinding good anymore. I want the advanced workout II."
3,Good enough as a general guideline in making Goals,"This book is good enough if one is just wanting a general guideline re: how to set goals; it gives you details such as definition, types of goals, examples of each category and some notes on how to implement each goal. Bookwise - 3 stars (cause I expected more from it); For the seller: 4 stars - the book arrived earlier than expected, so that was a great service; would recommend this seller. Thanks for the great service! Keep it up!"
2,the complete idiot's guide to reaching your goals.,"I gave this book a reluctant two stars because depending on your purpose some of the information in this book (very little)could be useful. As a student of self improvement books for 7 or 8 years this is not one of the best I've read.In fact Jeff Davidsons book worries me that it might give the wrong impression on those first time readers that is really in need of self improvement. In a nutshell; not for beginners, buyer beware, I feel that I'm the idiot who got taken out of my money."
5,Night Full Of Rain,"Night Full Of Rain is a fascinating, surreal, beautifully shot film about a dysfunctional relationship. When I ordered this DVD through Amazon, it arrived promptly and in pristine condition. This little-known gem is modestly priced."
5,Night Full Of Rain,"I loved this film, very well acted and totally unlike any other film i have seen. was well worth the wait. one of Candice Bergen's better films, an underated actress"
3,Dissapointed,"There is another version coming out April, 07. This will be much better I hope. This is more expensive and no subtitles. The case quality is bad, also. As for the actual show. Of course that is 5stars."
2,Disappointing!,"This book sounded fascinating, especially after it was described as a sort of South African ""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" which is one of my favorite books ever! It turned out to be pretentious, boring and contrived -- the main characters were never really developed and unfortunately, we found out far less about the anthropological discoveries than I would have liked."
4,A Living Fire,"Excellent compilation of then-Contemporary Christian songs from the 1980's. Includes the hard-to-find classics ""We Are His Hands"" by Whiteheart and ""We Are An Offering"" by Chris Christian, which are worth the cost of the CD by themselves. Every track includes the driving drum beats and synthesized instrumentation so popular in the 80's. A nostalgic listen to the early days of pop-rock influenced Contemporary Christian music."
3,Alright,"I thought the balaclava would be more form fitting. It's okay, but it's looser than I expected. Overall I'm not dissatisfied."
3,not for the beginner,"This vid was rated as beginner to intermediate on a different website...wrong. Ideally, before buying this title, you should have the Major, Melodic and Harmonic scale modes already memorized.Nonetheless, it definitely hooks you in at first because Franks playing is so fluid and flawless, but trying to keep up with his speed is practically impossible.I did learn a lot of priceless stuff from this video, but, halfway through, got overwhelmed and put it aside."
1,terrible... just terrible,"I am majoring in Spanish in college and thought I was buying a book that could help me. This book and disc were terrible. The book only tells you how to use the disc and the disc ... well, a monkey could of wrote something better in today's language."
5,Lowest price alternative,Lowest price alternative for L-Tyrosine 500mg 100. The tablets look and feel as if they came from the same producer of another higher priced version.
2,It begins to fade,After a while the laser begins to fade dramatically. I don't think its the one your looking for if you need a bright efficient laser that doesn't eat batteries like candy. I admit that it was fast shipping but I would rather have it slow and a better product.
2,laser,laser was pretty cool but not bright enough for my liking so i got a 30mw laser and it was great no problems with the laser tho it was very good quality i have dropped it many times and still works very good
2,"imaginative and lovely, but bogged by allegory","Primavera--in love with her uncle's lover--runs away from the Edenic home and family to the dark drug-addicted and violent world of the city, meeting half-breed orphaned children and her aunt. While Primavera is a better tale than some of Block's others, it still suffers from her meandering stream-of-consciousness telling which is more repetitive and dull than poetic and meaningful. The book is much more allegorical than fantasy, taking away the magic that could be there. Grade: C+"
3,Imaginative and weird,It was a lot better in my memory of it compared to when I actually reread it. Seemed a little immature the second time around.
1,book,"I loved Violet and Claire. That was my first FLB book and I read such rave reviews about Primavera so I picked it up and read it.The beginning was very good but as story progresses it becomes boring and hard to pay attention to. Towards the end I caught myself skipping pages. It was that hard to read! I wish this story only focused on Prima, Paul, Rafe and Dionisio.They are the most interesting. There are so many characters in this book.. Too much at times. I hope I can read this book again and enjoy it but for now I hate it."
3,"Though used, still good",I cannot complain about anything but the shipping time. It took 15 days to get this little book and that's 15 days with a broken tail light. No good if you need something fixed this weekend.
4,Good book...If you have a little background knowledge.,"This book is a typical Haynes Repair Book. If you have some knowledge of the car your working on, this book will help you complete the task at hand. If you're looking for a starting point with no automotive experience or knowledge, you might be in for a surprise.Pictures are a little primitive, but there are lots to see.Sections for just about every thing you can repair."
5,Good book,They spend one night together & the next morning he has an accident which wipes out his memory of that night. He meets her again months later and can't figure out why he's attracted to her & why her baby seems so familiar.
3,Passable entertainment,"Routine adventure flick finds an aging, rather tired looking Errol Flynn as the captain of a salvage boat involved in murder and sunken treasure. It's passable entertainment until the last 15 minutes when it goes all sanctimonious on us. Raymond Burr is the villain and Ruth Roman is the dish desired by both Flynn and Burr. The most interesting character is the detective for hire who plays both sides against the middle played by Paul Picerni. The B&W; cinematography by Robert Burks (an Oscar winner for TO CATCH A THIEF) is decent enough but the film could have benefited from Technicolor. Max Steiner's score helps out too.The Warners Archive MOD DVD is a nice transfer."
3,Michel Cote is quite the make up (and make out) man,"A little slow, but if you take the time to watch, and notice all the going's on, you will find more and more things to laugh at.Michel Cote is amazing with his ""transformations"" in characters.This is a French Canadian film. I did watch it with English dubbing, only cause I don't understand French. Still thought it was pretty funny. A film I would buy, but would want the English dubbing and not sub titles. Personal preferance.Definitely not for children."
5,Best book ever,Painted Diaries is one of the best books I have ever read! I could not stop reading it. It is a great book for families how are expeirenceing the painful Alzhiemers disease. I STRONGLY reacomind it!
3,"Helpful for implementations, V8 content an afterthougt","A useful guide if you are implementing an ERP for the first time, never seen/used PeopleSoft and don't understand the consultant's methodology.It is not good on Version 8 specifically and is of little to no value for existing implementations.I found a huge amount of content devoted to the Windows Client when version 8 is about moving from this to the web. It seems this book was originally written about how to implement Version 7.5 and then had revisions when version 8 was released prior to the publish date.Better title would have been Understanding PeopleSoft, without the ""8"" bit."
1,ring,"It is a cute ring, but s small, not much about it - not crazy about it - never wore it. Gave it to my niece. You get what you paid for on this one. Sorry."
2,Somewhat Disatisfied,When I viewed this particular ring it looked really nice and small & somewhat what I was looking for I am just in question on why the stone seems to be so cloudy? I use high quality jewerly cleaner & it still comes out looking dull. I realize the stone is very small & delicate but am not too impressed by the quality.
5,"I know, I Know,...Picasso,..but I love printmaking so i had to do it.","OK,...there are thousands of books on Picasso, and to tell the truth, I own a few of them,..I am not sure why I keep adding to my Picasso book collection, but this one,.....this one is the first one I purchased that is dedicated solely to his reduction linocut prints. Are the prints masterful? Some are... But what I really like about this book is that Picasso was the inventor of Reduction linocut printmaking technique, and here we have great example of his creative process as he digs deep within the materials and sees what comes of it. There are some prints that are absolutly amazing, and to Picasso's credit, they are incredibly imaginative and so simple. Some prints just look like gouges in the sand,..no biggie,..just not my thing. I LOVE printmaking, so this book was easy to get interested in and it is a fine example of this one branch of Picasso's grand creative oak tree.....does that make sense? Well......."
3,In The Red,"I thought ""In the Red"" was good but Regan's first book ""Downtick"" was so much better. It was a book I could put down and not pick up for awhile. The suspense wasn't there. Too many other details involved in this book that didn't quite measure up. I will buy his next book which I understand he is working on, he is an excellent writer. This one just did not do anything for me."
3,"Good, but not as good as ""Downtick""","I was looking forward to more of the same fast paced action of ""Downtick"". ""In The Red"" was slower paced, a lot more predictable and less believable than ""Downtick"". I really liked the main charaters Jake and his buddy Don. I hope they reappear in other books. My comment to the author, ""Do not rush the next book, craft it like I know you can."""
5,Great item!!,Remarkable reduction in felt recoil on my MN 91/30. I used this in conjunction with the rubber replacement recoil pad. It felt like bird shot in a 20 ga.
2,Kind fo fits,Doesn't really fit all gun stocks. Won't fit the top of my mosin too well. They also should have made it a little longer as it feels like it would slip off easily.
4,Effective recoil reduction for my Mosin,"Good product, only used once so far. The fit isn't great, it tends to drift to the side of the butt plate a bit. I'm pleased with the value and will try it on my 12 gauge next."
2,A little disappointed,"Bought this for the Mossberg 500 and was a little disappointed. I say a little because I spent a little, so expectations weren't high. First, it fits the stock okay but not securely enough to stop it from wiggling around and shifting during shooting. The material isn't very good quality either because mine is starting to rip apart at the seams and is getting worn out quickly. The biggest disappointment is that it doesn't even lessen the recoil all that much. I mean, it helps but doesn't reduce it enough to make it comfortable to shoot 25 to 30 shells. Compared to the Limbsaver slip-on pad I just got to replace it, this gel pad can't even compete. Not worth the money in my opinion."
5,Outstanding pad,This pad is great for lessening the recoil from your 12 gauge shotgun. It's very easy to use & also looks great on your weapon.
3,They work.,"The pads, one outer and up to 3 inner (provided), work. The outer pad moves a bit which makes it an issue for competitive target shooters but for anything else it's 100% useful."
5,Great product.,"I bought one for our 11 year old son last year. I was so impressed, I loaned it out to a friend and he ended it up buying it from me. Now I have two more. A great product that stays in place and definitely reduces recoil. The extra pads don't necessarily stay in place, but they don't matter much."
3,Awesome for the money,This is a very inexpensive item that works good. It's a little small so it looks a little off on some larger rifles. The gel pads do a good job of absorbing the recoil. I put 20 rounds through a 300 Win Mag and still felt good. Not shoulder pain.
5,Recoil Pad,Great for young children to use so the gun doesn't hurt their shoulder. I would recommend this for anyone that has younger shooters and wants them to enjoy shooting like I do.
4,~,Good product. Pads that came with it are crap and wondered why they even bothered.. but also not needed.. great stretch and fit to any gun.. Seems like it would fit a single shot girls 22 all the way up to a big stocked shotgun. Mine went on a 870 Wingmaster and fits great.
4,recoil pads,I bought this item for my wife. She likes to target shoot with me but her shoulder would be sore after a days shooting.She has tried it although its not the exact shape it worked fine.
1,Too Small,"It was only offered in one size. That size only fits my smallest 16 guage stock, and that's a stretch. It won't come close to fitting my 12 guage. Also it is a bit spongy in that the gun does not feel like it shoulders well."
3,"great cushioning, variable fit","These are great little buttstock pads, in that they actually cushion your shoulder instead of merely increasing the length of pull. However, for smaller/thinner stocks, the fit will be a bit loose, as it was on my rifle."
5,Excellent Product,"I bought this for my single shot H&R Pardner 12 gauge and was amazed at the extent to which it reduced felt recoil. I went trap shooting with a few friends and, with this recoil pad on my Pardner, my shotgun had much less felt recoil than either of the semi-auto 12 gauges used by my friends. That's pretty amazing considering that, at 5.5 pounds, my Pardner is an extremely light gun. While others walked away after a few rounds with bruises, I left unscathed thanks to this recoil pad."
3,From The Cover,"The instant Australian billionaire Hugo Fullbright sees Angie Blessing he knows he has to have her. There's no doubt about the instant sizzling sexual attraction between them! So why, at first, does Angie refuse his offer?Angie cannot tell Hugo the real story. But finally succumbs to his his powers of seduction and agrees to join him on a weekend trip to Tokyo... not realizing that he's a man used to paying for what he wants, and that she is been bought - and brought - for his pleasure.My comments : There is Hugo, can you say cad? and Angie is a strong woman for the most part, then there is Paul Angie's inattentive boyfriend. Let the fights begin."
5,"Quick and Easy, Your Xpression Sellxtion","This cookbook in 1975 was for active and on the go people. I was one of them. Now I have many cookbooks and need to find space, but this is great for those on the go even today. Meal preparation times are taken into consideration in this book, Menus include easy to assemble dinners and takes into consideration Family & Company Meals, Menus for Small Parties, Make-Ahead Dinners, DINNERS FOR TWO, and Barbecue dinners. Great book for those on the go..."
1,Don't Buy It This Way!,"I highly recommend against buying this way....I thought I was getting a deal but didn't. We were unable to do the one click download because we didn't have the right Windows version. Because we had clicked on the $13 item, we thought if we downloaded them all we would still get that price....It didn't work that way. I spent nearly $70 when I had intended to spend only $13. Then the tags on the files are all messed up so my husband has spent the last 2 evenings trying to straighten them out so my player will play them in the correct order. Also had issues with the charges going to our gift card rather than the credit card selected at check out. This is not a bargin in any way shape or form....it would have been cheaper and less aggravation to just buy the physical CD."
4,"Pretty, but not quite smoky","I assumed that smoky meant dark and these colors are not ""smoky"" in my opinion, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. The colors are nice though and very appropriate for daywear. If you want a darker smoky eye, you'll need to purchase different colors. I also found the original smoky eye kit to be not as dark as I thought it would be. Again, very appropriate for daywear. I guess I could add more and more product to get a ""smoky"" look. I like the colors though, so I decided to keep them."
4,GREAT BOOK...,"I absolutely loved this book and I even bought it for some friends, but they told me it was a bit too technical. and it just a little to complex for the average reader."
2,not that great,"I bough this to help inform my husband of the importance of drinking water - I read the first few pages and that was it, and didn't even share it with him - the beginning is the author talking about how his fight with the mainstream medical community"
4,"Very good, but too technical in parts.","I enjoyed this book. I'm already a believer in drinking copious amounts of water. My skin is clearer and I feel better. So much of the information in this book wasn't all that new to me.On the other hand, this book gets into chemistry, biology, physiology and other technical areas that make the book drag.But overall, it's a good read."
5,very informative book,I bought this book because my daughter has asthma. We have tried some of the techniques in this book and they are working. We received it very fast.
1,Some insulin for you...,"I recently included a chapter/day, in my new book, about Dr. Batman--that's what I call him. Although a few of his ideas are insightful and make one think about hydration on a different level, he falls through the cracks with his gusto for how many eggs he can consume and his belief that water, no matter what the quality, is some sort of insulin.He's gathered wide attention with this book, but what many fail to see, is that he is trying to turn water into some miracle treatment itself. He disregards everything else and prompts the reader to treat their symptoms rather than to eliminate their symptoms altogether.Dr. Batman, I have not had anything to drink for over eight months now, and I lack thirst, dehydration, or any of these symptoms water seems to cure. What's the deal?"
4,great book,i wish i had read this book sooner. Dr. Batman just tell us what wrong with the pharmaceutical companies and a way to fix it our self. The book is an open eye.
4,Common sense isn't always common,"I just ordered this book so I'm not giving a ""book review"" as much as I'm supporting an idea that should be as second nature as breathing -- and some don't do that the way they should. Water, is so important to our overall well being and I think those who are looking for ""medical"" or ""scientific"" proof of this is dense. I also agree that this over proliferation of drugs for whatever ails you, and drugs for ailments that haven't been invented yet [but, coming soon]is all about $$$ for drug companies. If you want proof, try going without water for say, a week, then see how you feel - that`d be your proof."
5,reality check,"This is one of those books who make you realize the damage your body has to endure when we don't know about the benefits of water,but the kicker is that it is very well explained and if you are not much of a reader like me ,it doesn't matter you will understand and you will start drinking water as you should.you will thank your self later for reading this book"
3,Let's Go 2005 Italy (Let's Go Italy),"Hello,I am very sad about this book. I expected better travel guide. It was nearly completely useless during our holiday. We have been in the north and middle part of Italy by car in this summer (2005). The maps of the cities were too small to easy understand it. The description of the cities were not satisfactory for us. The signs of the place of interest were right and the entrance prices were mainly correct. The book serves a broad choice of hotels, bars but you hardly find campsites in it. The bars and self service restaurants which are listed never signed in the maps. You get information from where and how you can go there but you don't know where you are exactly because of the poor maps.I think there is better travel book on the marked but I have no any experience with that so I can't offer better choice yet.I hope you will be luckier with any kind of Italian travel book like I."
1,Disco Classic Dud,"These are not the original recordings, but a group called the Soul Disciples. If you want the original songs by the original artists, don't buy this cd."
1,not for serious smokers,"If you have 1 or 2 a day it may help, otherwise it really does not make a big difference. Broke down in a short while too."
3,Cold and Dry Performance!!!,"i am not an expert but i love Schubert's IMPROMPTUS.This performance by Brendel was devoid of all sensitivity and emotion and seems matter of fact.I am immensely grateful to INGRID HAEBLER for a wonderful and sensitive readings of these otherworldly pieces.listen to Ingrid haebler playing the 5th impromptu to understand what i mean.There is mystical and delicate ,poignant quality about these pieces that Haebler brings to perfection.The shift in tempo and dynamics is quite a treat.none of these are to be found in Brendel's playing.IF you have not listened to Ingrid Haebler Playing the IMPROMPTUS you have not heard them at all!"
3,"Meal recipes kind of lame...""gift"" recipes are good though","I can't be too upset about this book as I bought it used, so I got my money's worth. If I had paid full price, even Amazon's discounted price, I would have been annoyed. The recipes seem to be a little ""formula"", just take a regular recipe and add some truffles or andouille and it's ""Emerilized""...a little hack if you ask me. There are however several recipes (and even a chapter) on things you can give as a gift though...homemade barbecue sauce or bottled ""essence""...good stuff when you want to give something to that distant aunt, but don't want to break the bank."
1,I've seen better,"I hold Emeril personally responsible for ruining our Christmas last year. The recipes in this book were so bad, and the directions were so misleading that we didn't get to have our dinner. He ought to be ashamed of himself"
1,Bad bad bad,"The recipes in this book made me sick. I tried them exactly the way they were written. It was bad. Watching Emeril on TV is painful enough, but I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. Sorry, I was wrong. This book should be discontinued."
1,Disappointing book,"Emeril's book ""Creole Cristmas"" is a big dissapointment. His recipes aren't anything like the ones he does on TV. They are hard to follow, and are missing steps. I had troubles trying to make some of the dishes. I wasn't happy with this book."
1,review of christmas book,I did not like this book at all. I did not like the recipes. They were terrible. Emeril is not the cook that the TV makes him out to be. This was a dissapointment.
1,Not worth the money,There are much better holiday books out there than this. Emeril tries too hard to 'Emerilize' virtually every old time favorite Christmas dish. I've seen a lot better elsewhere.
5,Sexy,"The coffin is just plain sexy. Hangin' on the drums, nearly out of sight.... spectators comment on how nice the coffin is and not the drums!"
5,Great.,This item was critical for my KVM switch to function with my computer.. Easy to use and install. Using it right now. Thanks.
1,Did not work with Kensington wireless mouse,"This product was made specifically for adapting from P/S2 to USB for use with a mouse, but it does not work with the Kensington wireless mouse."
1,Crappy,This was a horrible design does not work very well. I would suggest never to buy it.Very unhappy with the purchase.
1,Overpriced,I bought this as someone had recommended it to me and showed me the bottle she had as a reference. I was really disappointed on the bottle size I got for the price I paid; I do not think is worth the size of the bottle for the price paid.
4,hope it works,i have bought 6 bottles of this goods to help supply essence of eyes.hope it will work effectively.we will wait and see the result.
3,Waiting for results,I am trying this product and waiting for the results.Right now I feel it is too early to have an opinion
2,Does it work??,I tried this product for a little over a month. I cannot honestly say it made any difference in my vision.
4,Beyond the Fairway,"Author Jeff Wallach takes the golfer to places he may never have been. Not only physically, but spiritually. Jeff writes about playing golf in many areas of the world, but also about using golf to explore many areas of the mind and one's own emotions. The Zen philosophy is clearly the road map for this journey, and Wallach is able to pull together aspects of the sport's traditions, frustrations and beauty to show us how golf is far more than just a game. The chapter about playing golf in Scotland and the one on meeting Peter Martin, a golf professional in New York state's Adirondack mountains who believes golf can enlighten us, are the two most enjoyable passages in this book. It's a better read and any overly detailed instructional book. And it probably will help your game more, too."
3,just okay,"This is a very hard book to enjoy. Although it is written about my favorite subject, it is also written with a somewhat snobbish attitude. I don't care to be told that all the courses I play and have played don't constitute real golf because they aren't in Scotland. Once I got past my annoyance at these revelations, I found there are actually many good moments in the book. The Zen golf koans are also enjoyable. I'm glad I bought it used."
4,Lowe Pro Rezo,A really good camera bag. I've had one for six years. But the one thing that weakens an otherwise good product is that the belt flap is only fastened by a small velcro strip which wears out with time. Once the velcro is worn the bag has a tendancy to fall off your belt. This why I replaced my old bag with a new one. Newer models also have a snap to reinforce the velcro.
5,The Very Best,"Nearly impossible to find at either that big orange hardware store or the other big blue hardware store, or even the sawdust on the floor old fashioned hardware store. This bit LIVES in my DeWalt cordless drill, it is L-O-N-G so I can tighten ALL screws, including those annoying long screws on my Kwikset interior door locksets. Reversible is a big plus. You won't go wrong!"
3,4 months in experience,"Installed this weather vane in June 2012. Unit looks great and appears to be well built. However, the bearing which allows the cup device to spin in the breeze dries out and gets rusty, with the result the cups no longer turn. Bearing requires service every two months, involving steel wool and silicone or teflon spray lubricant. This seems too frequent for a device designed to be outside in the ""weather"". So if you're willing to drag out the ladder and spend 15 - 20 min servicing the unit every couple months to keep it working, it's a great product."
5,Great Introduction to The New Thought Movement.,"Everything ""New Age"" owes itself to the brave pioneers of their day, such as one of the finest, William Walker Atkinson, for bringing this knowledge to us. This is as good a review of New Thought principles as I have found anywhere and even if you think you already know all this stuff, you will find new points to ponder in this wonderful book."
1,A GLANCE OF EVERYTHING,"I was really dispointed at this book, it tries to cover everything, but at the end it covers nothing. Too many models to cover in just one book, too many subjects to cover in a single book, it is just a glance of everything. It barely lets you know a part exists, but doesn't tell you where it is or how to replace it.I wanted to know where the crankshaft sensor is in my cavalier, I didn't find any pictures, they explain how to replace it in just 5 or 6 lines, any warnings, oh! sure I had trouble with this sensor.The book doesn't explain the operation theory, and if you want to know something about Electronic Control Modules on these models, this is the wrong book."
3,Great if you are on a budget!,"Great deal. This is definitely the poor-man's plasma. The enhanced definition is almost as good as the HDTV versions. For the money, this is a great value, hands-down. If you are considering this product versus a non-plasma just go for this.It has a beautiful picture, hangs beautifully on the wall and looks great but it does make a little noise on whites and when on in general which can be a little bit annoying! All in all, I rate this a healthy 3.5 stars."
2,Not Thumb-drive friendly,"I've used this hub for a year or so and have been disappointed. The connecting cord to the PC is very short and does not sit easily atop the mini-tower. I can plug my USB thumb-drive and printer into the hub without needing to use the power adaptor and this is a major plus. However, when I needed to use all four ports (and the power adaptor), the hub would cycle through the connections, causing WinXP to ""drop"" the thumb-drive every few minutes then re-connect a couple seconds later. Quite annoying."
5,You Can Gauge the Success of Munson's Arguments...,"...by the threatened reaction from those that have little to gain and all to lose by steering artistic focus toward definitions of beauty, quality and meaning executed by passionate artists, and away from the use of art exhibitions as purely political and social tools of the left, or simply because it's a fashionable career path in many of today's institutions.If you're tired of art being defined by publicity stunts and attacks on your intelligence or values by naked emperors and empires, you ought to read this, because you are not alone. There are many of us who feel this way.It took courage to write this book and I applaud her for it."
1,"Tired, Sad Conervative Rhetoric","The underlying premise of this book is that if the piece of art isn't a nice painting of horsies or kittens or that the piece is politically charged in the least, then it is not art and merits scorn. The book could have been called ""The Thought Police."" Thank you for setting guidelines for us as to what art is and isn't and what we should enjoy."
2,Munson's Political Agenda,"From the deconstructionist perspective which Munson tries so hard to villify in her book, it seems only fair to point out that her arguement itself--nay, the entire raison d'etre of her book--is politically charged and dogmatic. It is important and necessary to understand the cultural context in which not only makes the book seem relevant, but also why Munson herself feels compelled to add her voice into this debate with her brand of intellectual populism. If you read this book, I would recommend reading any other book that might offset it and provide a perspective on why the nature of art is being examined and deconstructed in the first place. Trying to take art out of a political sphere of analysis, as Munson does in this book, is in itself a very political act."
1,Predictable blather,"A friend showed me this book. She didn't think it was very good, and neither do I. It's ironic that a book subtitled ""Art in the Age of Intolerance"" is itself so intolerant. It's also shallow, poorly written, and not terribly well-informed. Munson's only real talent appears to be for personal character assassination, which is applied selectively to the book's villains.In short, this is a book for people who already know what they want to be told, and are either afraid or unwilling to learn anything that breaks the mold now set by the reactionary right."
1,"Leaden, overblown; a complete suckfest.","Every number here is played like the musical equivalent of walking through frozen molasses. There is no life to even such should-be-upbeat numbers like Classical Gas or Tijuana Taxi. John Williams even manages to suck the life out of the Pink Panther theme. If you like your tunes deadly dull and lead-footed, this is the disc for you. Otherwise, go find a collection from a real conductor."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about Walt Disney World..,"I was amazed by the thoroughness of this book. It seems that the Perlmutters have achieved the impossible - seeing everything at Walt Disney World. The descriptions of the hotels, attractions and restaurants are very detailed and include many helpful hints. I always thought Disney was for kids until I read this book - I am now really excited about visiting Walt Disney World as an adult! The only downside to this book is that there is no real ""critical"" voice - the book contains no negative criticism of Disney. Can EVERYTHING at Walt Disney World be as great as the Perlmutters say? With that said, it is still a very good book."
3,Don't be fooled,"In preparation for our January 2003 trip to Disney World, I bought just about every book available (5 in all) to assist me in the planning process, including this one-- which looked promising. I've discovered that the key to a good Disney Guidebook is in its TIMLINESS. Things are constantly changing at Disney. That being said, it's important to note that while this book says ""2002-2003"" on the cover, the prices reflect those for 2001 and so do some of the attraction suggestions. While I know it must be challenging trying to keep up with all those changes, the Unofficial Guidebooks and others have done a MUCH better job of keeping pace. I would suggest that the Perlmutter's take it one year at a time in terms of publishing dates in order to deliver the best quality product for their readers. I will say that some of their suggestions are worthwhile, as long as they are still available."
5,Why Buy It When It's Re-run on TV,"When TV shows are re-run after primary air, they edit out as much as 2.5-5 minutes of actual show in order to cram more commercials in. When buying the DVD not only do you get the luxury of seeing them with NO commercials, but you are watching the entire episode as originally aired. Not to mention DVD quality is the best quality available. Re-runs over time begin to show their age in both video and audio quality."
4,Growing up with FRIENDS,"I think it's a good deal having all these seasons in one whole compilation, every person has it's own Friend's character, it's really sad that the curtain falls for the last time, anyway that's where this dvd comes in handy, can't wait for the last 3 season to come up."
3,friends,It is cheaper to buy each season individually rather than all seasons together. It is a $35 difference.
5,a note to the reviewer below,"in case you havent realized, Friends is going to be put off air.that means we won't be able to watch it anymore on TV for 'free'...I thought *everyone* knew that"
2,Low quality listenings really do nothing for this text.,"In this day and age, I can't believe that anyone would produce a textbook in which the listening materials are so utterly inauthentic. Bad voice actors hamming it up is not what my students need. REAL listening texts please in future!"
3,A different take on Beauty and the Beast,"If you are a fan of unusual artwork full of surreal and whimisical florishes, then this may very well be the book for you. This edition is a reprint of the 1983 Beauty and the Beast illustrated by Etienne Delessert. The text is more or less traditional, but the illustrations in this book are not, and tend to symbolize ideas in the story rather than literally illustrate them. If you are familiar with Delessert's work then you pretty much know what to expect. Still, the art is beautiful and full of inventive whimsy. But if you're looking for a more traditionally illustrated version of Beauty and the Beast you may want to look to other editions illustrated by Mercer Mayer or Jan Brett."
4,Light and portable,"I bought this printer for travelling, and it's quite satisfactory. Very light, compact, easily fits in a suitcase. Print quality is perfectly adequate. It does use up ink pretty quickly, but if you only print black and white (as I do), the large black ink cartidge is a much better buy."
5,Canan BCJ 2110,"I have had two Canon BJC 2110s--one of which came with my Gateway PC way back in 2001, and then (when it finally broke down in 2007) another equally old, but which I bought used online last year. An excellent printer! The only problem is that sometime the paper bends to the right or left, but that can be remedied if you make sure you're in between the paper guides. I'm very fond of ""my little guy"" and am sad that he's not being manufactured any more.Raanan Geberer, NYC"
2,Not bad if you like incomplete checklists...,"I just recently purchased this book off of Amazon, and once I started going through it, I quickly became disappointed. I have a very small stack of about 20 Bob Feller cards, and a few of them were not even listed, so I'm sure that there are several other Feller cards that are missing. I bought this book because I wanted to collect every Bob Feller card ever made, and now I am right back where I started - without a complete Bob Feller checklist. Also, though no fault of the author's, this book only goes up through 1999, so nothing from 2000-present will be listed, and the prices listed for each card are sure to be a little out of date.The good things about this book are that every major player you may want to collect will be listed, and they are in alphabetical order for easy reference.Bottom line: Nice book if you just want to collect a handful of your favorite player's cards, but if you're going for a complete collection, I can't recommend it."
5,This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard!,"I too discovered Howard Lyons while listening to a native radio station, and the music is absolutely stunning. I bought the CD immediately, and usually when I buy one I expect one or two good songs maybe, but every single song on this one is good. ""Well on our way"" bring to life the magic of falling in love so well, and ""Spirit Walk"" is a haunting illustration of the journey we make into the next world. I love them all. The arrangements are beautiful with lush backing vocals and great execution. I highly recommend this one!!!!"
4,Wow! When did I buy this thing? Still using it!,"It's an ugly backpack but it has held up remarkably well. I've fallen off my skateboard several times and slid on this thing and it lives to stow another day. Banged up and dirty, yes, but still kicking. More pockets than I could possibly use, a place for a lap top and a pocket big enough for a CD player (what's a CD players?) with a little hole for, well, whatever gets you off. Buy one, hippie!"
4,What a great fantasy,"Stand up comedy meets open mic night, but the guys are naked while they're telling their tales of woe. Great concept. Great looking guys - sure beats those fake porn videos."
4,An enjoyable recording,"OK, so it's not top of the pile - that honor belongs to John Eliot Gardiner, whose version knocks spots off every other recording. However, although it's made by a ""full"" orchestra with ""operatic"" voices, and although it sometimes sounds ponderous, it has a charm and grandeur all of its own - and the late Hermann Prey's rendering of the aria ""Grosser Herr und starker König"" is toe-curlingly beautiful and worth the price of the discs alone."
1,Bad Business,"This book just goes to prove that it isn't globalizations or cheap labor that is ruining society (as the author would like you to believe), but the preposterous idealism that the author has. In a world where it will never be a utopia (no matter how hard we try), it is essential that every person is able to recieve value for a purchase. If something is sold for a dollar at a discount store, and it is worth a dollar that is an even trade. If it is sold for two at another shop, that is value loss. This book is aswim with critisizms of value and percieved value that frankly are unjustified."
1,Awful,"An awful, boring, badly-translated book that has neither structure, arguments nor any well-defined points. It reads like a rambling late-night conversation between two people with a lot of shared background knowledge; proper explanation of points is in short supply. Also, on the copy I bought here in Dublin, its back cover blurb is woefully misleading: ""a compelling and shocking account of society's greedy over-consumption"" that ""paints a bleak picture of our increasing obsession with cheap goods"". It is not! It's a how-to for retailers and businesses who want to negotiate the sticky world of cheaper, cheaper, cheaper, not an account of the real cost of low-price goods.A waste of money."
2,The Other Book is better for Christian Writing,This book gave some insight and examples of other christian writing. It only had great information and insight in the beginning chapter (introduction). The rest was a waste of buying and only could have gotten their other book on christian writing and publishing.
1,Poor Quality Control,"First Sharp R-1520LK cooked ok but fan wouldn't run therefore was a fire hazzard. Sent back to Amazon. Can't believe Amazon didn't double box as all the foam packing was all busted. Manufactured in 2009.Second Sharp R-1520LK wouldn't cook in High mode. Everything came out luke warm at best. Popcorn only popped 40% of the corn. Fan did work on this one. This microwave was purchased locally.If I can get my money back I'm going to get a GE from Home Depot. Otherwise I'm stuck with a repaired Sharp. The word ""Lemon"" keeps coming up. Manufactured in 2008."
1,Podhoretz the armchair warrior,"The comment of the previous reviewer that to ""refute Podhoretz is self-refuting"" because it reveals an ""anti-American bias"" is quite indicative of the Nazi/Stalinist nature of the argument here as well as the intellectual totalitarianism of Poddy's followers and groupies. Even by his own exceptionally low standards of reason and intellect, this book amounts to pretty shoddy Poddy. It tells us nothing new or meaningful about the nature of the war, the issues involved or who fought in it (a hint: it wasn't Poddy's children or relatives or any of his his fellow literary parasites sunning in the Hamptons or holding literary soirees on the Upper East Side of Manhattan); rather it is another episode in his ongoing psychodrama combatting the""Anti-American Left"", i.e those in the publishing and literary worlds who no longer invite him to their party's, seeing him as the tiresome self-centered blowhard that he so clearly is."
2,Where's the beef?,"I was dissappointed in this book. As an HR manager wanting to create a ""Best Practices"" New Hire Orientation program out of our exisiting ""good"" program, I did not find the book very useful. There was very little new information to improve my current program. Rather than informing you how to create your own program, most chapters highlighted programs from other businesses and your option is to attempt to squeeze a few ideas out of whatever chapter is similar to your business. I did find a few ideas throughout the book that I may incorporate and there is a good chapter on games and activities to energize the session. Otherwise the bulk of the information wasn't of use to me. The book might be helpful to someone who is establishing their first NHO session."
1,Manufacturing Error,"I agree with the other reviewer. You should steer away from this highlights CD. I bought it to replace a scratched version, and I had a ""what the...?"" reaction when ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" came through my stereo speakers. I shrugged it off until ""Swan Lake"" started playing a few cuts later. I will try the full-length version, which is still a bargain. The performances on this recording are fantastic, especially the warm-voiced Margaret Price."
5,Best of the Best,"This book is filled with heartfelt lessons. Very moving, and the story of Miss Chandler is a statement of what young people should be now-a-days."
5,SUPER GIRL SCOUT SHOWS HER STUFF!,"I was extremely impressed that a young girl from where I live (small city of Roanoke) could have such an impact on so many famous people - dignataries, writers, actors, and other celebs. It was an awe-inspiring view on life's important lessons shared in similarities by most people throughout the world. A round of applause for this SUPER Girl Scout - a fine example of what youth should be doing today."
5,One of my favorite CD's,"When I picked this cd up used for $2 I was thinking ""Well this will probably be one of those cd's that I listen to once and then it will end up in my pile of cd's"". Well little did I know that this would be one of the most played cd's I own. This is one of the best chant cd's I have ever heard (and I've heard plenty). The music is very beautiful and moving without being... well emotionalistic. If you love chant or are interested in it, check this cd out."
4,Soothing,"I bought this disk while feeling depressed and not being able to focus. The chanting soothed me and gave me some piece of mind. Why then not 5 stars, you ask? Because the sound lacks a bit of clarity despite the remastering and the performance is good, but not exceptional."
2,Not one of the better recordings,"I have been collecting various recordings of Gregorian Chant and picked this one up based on the selections, price and reviews on Amazon. But I was shocked and appalled when I first played the disc. The great glory of Gregorian Chant is that it is to be sung unaccompanied -- yet on most of the cuts on this disc (10 out of 17) an organ is heard none-too-discretely intoning the opening sequence of notes and then underscores the entire chant! It was very disconcerting hearing this, but there are other problems, too. The singing itself is some of the ugliest I have heard on chant recordings -- nasal and throaty. And in addition, on some tracks you can hear what sounds like doors slamming shut, things dropping on the ground... all manner of intruding noises. I have tried my best to overlook what I can only call defects in this particular recording, but I've finally decided I can't and will be unloading this disc pronto."
3,Salve Regina:Gregorian Chant,"I LOVE IT!Helps you meditate and take a break from the choasness of life and be with God, His angels and His saints. Wonderful! It is so serene and with God....."
2,Leaders of THEIR Time,"Leaders of Our Time is a biography-style book which depicts the lives and careers of thirteen of the world's most famous leaders around the year 1965. The ""mini"" biographies consist of basically a background of the persons life and their, ""rise to greatness."" To me this book was a bit too out of date to keep me overly interested. Let's just say this book was not hard to put down. There were some interesting points though. Seeing which leaders are still talked about in our history books today, is an easy way to determine the actually influence of the leaders in the 21st century. In closing, this book would be a great source for research or a history buff, but next time you want to curl up with a nice book try one that will not posses you to turn on the ol'tele."
3,karaokecd,didnt get it until 3days later. Wasn't what i thought it was. didnt work in my machine or the other cd i bought previous will think twice next time. if there is a next time :(
2,OK only,"There seems to be many books out there with photos of MM that haven't been seen before and this is one of them. My disapointment is that the author does not discuss virtually anything about his unique relationship with Marilyn. This is another picture book only, and in that respect, fair."
3,Yo!,"One of my friends mom hates me because I like this song. Moving on, this is a 3 star track because it gives me a headache after a while. Also, if you get the edited version (I found it on the web), it has a TERRIABLE editing job. They edit about every single lyric out! Also, the lyrics arn't that great, but most raplyrics arn't either (sadly, because rap music doesn't have much of a beat so you're forced to concentrate on the lyrics). If you like Ludacris, you'll love this. Everyone who doesn't like rap, stay FAR, FAR, AWAY."
2,boring,all luda does is talk about how much ice he's carrying and what he's driving was he on an episode of cribs and other nonsense.
2,Too partisan to prove useful,"As a tax attorney, I was excited to purchase this book and get a non-partisan, in-depth look at what was going on with respect to the estate tax. Michael Graetz has a stellar reputation as a law professor, so I was doubly excited.I was very disappointed that the book's political bias appears on virtually every page. I think reasonable people can disagree on whether we should have an estate tax, but Graetz presents each and every proponent of repeal as a self-interested opportunist. I would have liked to have seen an unbiased account of what ""really"" goes on in Washington, but this book failed to satisfy.If you're looking for a book that will confirm your love for the estate tax, and need a reason to pat yourself on the back, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book that gives you an unbiased account of the world of politics, this book isn't for you. I found Showdown at Gucci Gulch much more interesting."
2,Normative Screed; misdiscriptive; unbalanced,"If you want to know how politics work in DC (politicians focus on their constituents, duh) then this is a good book. The same thing happened in the 1980s with deregulation--the forces of deregulation, headed by Alfred Kahn and others, overtook the forces of centralization, and consumers benefited.If, however, you want to know the pros and cons of having an estate tax, this is not the book for that--it's too biased, IMO."
3,just right for standard DVD's/case,"you can just fit, and i mean just, a regular DVD with case into one of these. with the 0 envelop shipping USPO first class is $1.11 per package. If you have a DVD case that is a bit larger you MUST use a #1 or #2 but your postage will go up to $1.35."
4,Viking Tales,"I bought the CreateSpace edition. The text is very clear, the paper and cover are of good quality. The illustrations are fine, though are less clear than the text. It arrived very quickly. Overall I'm happy with the quality and am excited to read the book with my children."
4,Definitely a Different Culture...,"This book has been an interesting read for us because it has given rise to many discussions about the Vikings and their values/beliefs. It is full of tales about their lifestyle, which was often violent and full of hardship. To give a few specifics....Harald (the king) has a ""thrall"" which is essentially a slave/servant with an iron collar banded around his neck, and there is much talk of the Viking Gods and their view of ""heaven."" I find it a fascinating book in many regards, but not always the easiest or most captivating reading for my seven-year old--it's taken some work on my end to develop/sustain her interest in some of these stories. I'd recommend it for a bit older age range (perhaps 10 and up)"
4,very good book,"book is great i just think the format could have been better. it dose tell all the names of the gods, is good for research."
3,Practice makes it better!,The book offers a great chance to practice each tool in the Photoshop software by reading each chapter's practices. The texts are easy to understand for whom wants to learn Photoshop at home. The Bonus CD contains many photos for you to make practice and to create your own works.
4,Flake pop,This is the best looking wax for the money. I would have given it 5 stars if it lasted more than 3 weeks.
2,do not waste your money,"This product didn't hold it's own against cheaper, off the shelf waxes. Once every few weeks my buddy and i take new waxes and compare them. So far we have accumulated around 15 different waxes. We test them for their ability to bead/sheet water, hide swirls, the color clarity they provide, and how easy it is to remove. This product beaded the water but not as well as the cheaper waxes. It didn't hide any swirls even after 2-3 coats of it. The color didn't change on the paint after applying the wax. Finally when trying to remove the wax it left a streaky finish even after letting it haze up for 12 hours. Overall it was an unsatisfactory product and would not recommend it to anyone. The only redeeming quality of this product is that it went on easier than any other wax."
2,I don't agree,"Well, this album has a lot of good reviews, so I bought it.I was a big Ten Wheel Drive fan. I saw them in concert 2 or 3 times.I was about 18-19 years old. I also read Genya Revan's autobiography where shecritisizes the leaders of TWD for being too structured.I bought a couple of her later albums including this one and I have to say - Thank Godthat TWD was so structured. TWD was a Jazz/Rock band with a Janis Joplin type singer.This album has a burnt out rock band, playing worn-out blues riffs. Nothing new or creative here. I guess if you love Genya you might like it. In my opinion her voice has just aged.If you like plain old rock and roll - get some Aerosmith or Rolling Stones."
1,Maybe I just got a bad lot with a lot of flaws.,"I received the smart spin storage system recently and at first thought it was great. Then I noticed that a lot of the containers have small holes in the very center of the bottom of them and there are several that have slits down one side of each of them. These are unusable for any liquids as they all leak, the ones with the holes as well as the ones with the huge cuts down the sides of them. I wish I could have a replacement set sent to me as I do like this product and feel that perhaps there was a problem with just this lot number or an oversight by their quality control department because I have purchased this item before and had no problems at all with it. But, I am a cancer patient and am just too sick to pack up and mail the one I have back. So I guess I'll just have to use them for dried goods only.Sincerely,Holly Pride"
2,Poor Quality,"I admit, I didn't research this item before I bought it. I really didn't know anything about it, and I thought it was something I could use for the storage containers I already had. Not so, but that's really my fault for not really looking at it.The reason I rated this 2 starts is that, like other reviews have stated, the quality of the plastic is poor. One of our containers has already cracked, and we haven't even had it that long. The plus is that it is easy to keep everything organized. This system might be okay for some, but I wouldn't advise you to waste your money."
2,Brilliant idea ... now if only someone would do it properly.,"This is a very smart idea, and would greatly simplify kitchen storage if it were executed better.Problems? Almost too many to list, but not quite:* Flimsy carusel: too tall to fit in most cabinets, and too ugly to leave out.* Poor-quality plastic: the containers discolour and scratch easily.* Poor lid seal: OK for fridge use, but anything you try to freeze will quickly burn.* Awkward shape: the larger containers are too tall and narrow.* Awkward flutes: the corners are fluted (to provide enough rigidity in the thin plastic), which makes it difficult to empty them.* Inadequate size: the largest container holds just 24 oz; for a real kitchen solution, they should go up to at least 60 oz.My least-favourite kitchen chore is searching for a suitable container, then searching for its matching lid. I would happily pay $$$ for a comprehensive solution. Rubbermaid, are you listening:?"
1,Still waiting,"I can not review the product at the time because I still have not received it. I am VERY dissatisfied with the company. They never tried contacting me in order to inform me that they ran out of the product. I ordered it as a CHristmas gift on Dec. 13th and it is Now January 14th, a month later, and I still have not received my shipment. I tried calling a couple weeks ago and they told me that they were expecting a new shipment the next day and that I should receive it within a week. I am still waiting...."
3,Mixed review,"Having collected a bunch of mismatched plastic over the years, I liked the idea of an easy to store system. As far as that goes, it's good. For day to day use it is fine and serves it's purpose. I did end up saving some of my larger old stuff, because none of the ""smart store"" containers are very large.I did crack one when I dropped it full of food, so there are higher quality plastics out there. This won't take a lot of abuse. The main drawback is that the way the lids fit, if you do drop one, it is almost guaranteed to pop the top off and spill."
2,Problems receiving product,"I ordered it through ""official SmartSpin website""It finally arrived after 59 days and phone call to credit card company to cancel the charge.Good concept, but qulity is not that good. They coul use better plastic.If you want to buy it get it through regular store, such as Target or Fred Meyer. DO NOT order through asseenontvnetwork web page."
1,SCAM?,"I'd love to review the actual product, BUT after ordering it 2 months ago from Merchant Media, I still have not received it!!! The commercial says to allow 2 to 6 weeks for delivery. Well, after A LOT of runaround and $ spent on long distance calls, I was told today that it was backordered for at least 2 more weeks. I discovered on Amazon that I can order this item from Target (a reputable seller) and they will ship it to me right away. IF you order this product, I recommend you order it from a trustworthy source that offers prompt shipping and a convenient & FREE way to track your order!"
4,Awesome,"I love these. I had some before, but had lost most of them. Only problem I've had is sometimes the biggest one isn't big enough, so I've had to either use 2 or 3, or supplement with some larger containers. But overall, it's made my cabinet MUCH more organized."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"I bought this because I saw it on TV and it looked like one of those things that you just can't live without. It is exactly what it shows to be. It does hold the containers and the lids do fit well on all the sizes, but don't throw out all the rubber storage that you already have. Not everything fits in these sizes. <br /><br />If I knew what I know now I would not buy it. I would invest in some better quality food storage, maybe Pyrex."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","Have been using this system for several years and am still intensely pleased. I can't think of any trouble with it, and the problem it solved with storing refrigerator dishes and lids in any other manner that wasn't FRUSTRATING (usually at a time when exhaustion was HUGE, too) was awful. After buying them also for our 3 grown kids' houses, we got this one just now for the mother-in-law of one of them. Our 3rd born had gotten one for her--but on a visit, we saw the old frustrations after dinner--at their vacation house."
4,Smart Spin,"Very compact way to store containers. We've had one of these systems for many years, this purchase was to replenish the pieces that have disappeared. None wore out, just walked away."
5,A window in to Lousia May Alcott's world,Louisa May Alcott: A Biography by Madeleine B. Stern is like reading a novel . Ms. Alcott is the herione and all the famous and interesting people who lived with her in Concord are characters that come alive and make you connect with the history of their time.
4,Sturdy yet comfortable,"If you're looking for the ultimate skating shoe, then don't buy this. But if you're looking for a pair of decent shoes, that look good, don't give in a lot, but feel very comfortable, then be my guest. It rates excellent in the price-quality factor, and it looks good too."
3,A better brand is Spectrum,"Ive used this and some products you can pick NOW and know your not going to get the quality, but it doesnt matter it still good. Im thinking their tea tree oil is great. But /w this oil Id recommend Spectrum. I use the refined Apricot seed kernel oil as my moisturizer. (its a cooking oil) but its very thick and does wonders for your face . Now doesnt compare to it. the cost is more for spectrum but its like night and day difference between the two. So though this is OK its not thick and creamy like Spectrums oil"
4,Beautiful Watch,I ordered this as a belated birthday gift to myself & love it!!! It can be dressed up or down.
4,Looks like it cost hundreds!!,Bought this item for my boss and had to peek to make sure it was nice - well I debated keeping it for myself it was so nice. I will be ordering for my friend and maybe for me - wish they'd give bulk pricing. :)
2,Landscape Plants for Dry Regions is a winner!,"I own several desert landscaping and gardening books and this book is by far the best of the bunch. It is organized according to species alphabetically, which makes it easy to look up plants. It is comprehensive...I have never failed to find the specific plant, bush or tree I am researching. Plus, full color photographs of each plant make it easy to pick and choose for visual effect."
5,Great but not required.,"I bought this to extend the distance from teh wall of my 32"" tv that was already mounted....it did the job, great but the deviced added hieght so the tv was too high with it and it didnt really make it turn more then it did before. So i took it off."
1,This is NOT a Voice Modem,"Although the product description says this is a voice modem, it is NOT a voice modem.""HiRO PCI Data Fax Voice Modem (H50083)"""
1,Looks are deceiving,"The model number of the item I received was not the model number I order. Also there was nowhere in the item description that stated it was a low-profile card. I assumed that I was getting a regular size card, but that was not what I received. I have know idea how good the item is since I could not use it. HiRO needs to perform some serious quality control on its products."
2,sleeper,"This was chosen for our book club and I really did not enjoy the story at all. Of course the topic was sad but the writing was not a ""page turner"" but only displayed the horrors of war and the selfishness practiced by those trying to survive!"
2,Not a great tale,This book I wanted to like and could not wait for it to arrive. It was very graphic and the language was horrible. This is not a great story or one that needed to be written. Don't waste your time or money.
1,The Holocaust was not a fairy tale,"The subject of this novel is all too real, and spinning it into a version of a fairy tale is totally inappropriate. The novel is cleverly written, and the author has contrived the facts of the Holocaust to fit into a fairy tale story. This trivializes the actual events, which destroyed millions of lives. The Holocaust was not a story to be cleverly twisted and ""spun"" into something else. It really happened, and a novelistic treatment of it still needs to respect the tragedy of it, and not use it for a clever exercise. I don't know what drew the author to write about this subject. Judging by her name, she isn't Jewish, Polish, or German. She apparently has no first-hand knowledge of the Holocaust, has never been to Poland, and has no other apparent connection to the events of this novel. So creating this novel was just an outlet for her creative talent, without true emotional content. This subject should not have been used that way."
4,Unexpected read,"I read this book as part of a book club. Did not know what to expect as this is a twist on some of the ""lighter"" stories we have been reading. Although I have studied and read about WWII I found it difficult at times to keep reading. It is still amazing and hard to fathom the terrors that occurred during this time in history. The author had a creative way to intertwine the story of Hansel and Gretel.This is not a book I would naturally just pick up and read, however, I am very glad that I did. My grandfather was a B17 bomber pilot in WWII - he never talked about his experiences, can only imagine what he encountered along the way at a very young age. It is a good reminder of history and makes me challenge my ability to stand up to injustices that occur in the present (no matter how small)."
5,Charming Story,"My book club read this book as one of our monthly selections. It was recommended by one of the members as one that she had read previously and enjoyed. I was a little afraid of it at first, because the topic of Nazi-occupied Poland is pretty dark and I was afraid that the book would be overly violent. (I have a low tolerance for violence in books, movies or otherwise).I was very pleasantly surprised. While it is a dark subject matter, the book was a charming story and there is hope throughout. It was also a good lesson in what it must have really been like for people in Poland in those days, sandwiched as they were between Stalin's Russia and Nazi Germany.Definitely worth a read."
5,The True Story of Hansel and Gretel,Great book. Characters well developed. Scenes so well defined that you can feel the cold and desparation. It was a total surprise to me.
4,great story,"I give this book only 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending dragged out a bit and the author didn't revisit two main characters of the novel. Otherwise, it's a great story. And ***spoiler alert*** I thought Magda's death scene was beautifully written."
1,Unnecessary Violence and Demented Minds,"How could anyone imaginatively add more grotesque and unspeakable horrors to an already tragic event in world history? Perhaps the deranged mind of Louise Murphy. And then deceptively entitle the book, ""The True Story of Hansel and Gretel"" when in fact there is nothing TRUE about it, save perhaps the setting of the book.It's one thing to read true life accounts of this most tragic event in the 20th century but to add fictional and morbid events to this for the pure enjoyment of entertainment is a bit peculiar to me.I read through about half of the book before deciding that I could no longer stomach the morbid and violent gibberish contrived by the author.Save your money. DON'T buy this book. Unless of course you are entertained by things like the raping of a young girl, purposeful and violent disfiguring of young innocent children and babies, and twisted accounts of erotic blood transfusions."
3,Not Too Great,"I recently read the book and in all honesty, I don't see the great hype over it. There's no real point to alluding to the Grimm Tales. It could have done without, and may have even created a greater impact on readers. The plot is interesting but to do this type of writing requires characters that can captivate the readers. Murphy merely uses the same repetitive method of referring to the character's weaknesses in her novel. I only found one character in the whole story that drew my attention, and that was the Major. Murphy revealed a man who readers could enjoy knowing more of, regardless of whichever side of the war he was on. The only thing Murphy is truly able to show is her knowledge of the war. The sad thing is that while her knowledge is clearly evident, her attempt to weave it into her fictitious tale seems much too fabricated. Perhaps, I am a bit too harsh, but in all honesty I felt sorely disappointed when finishing the book."
5,Just plain excellent!!,"It was just plain excellent. The author wove in the actual fairy tale very well. It was a page turner, the ending almost made me cry, even though I knew what was going to happen!!"
4,"Dark, Disturbing and Compelling","Dark and disturbing, but a very interesting and compelling book. I thought it was creative and different, albeit hard to read in some parts. Characters were well-drawn, and didn't necessarily fall into stereotypical behavior, which was refreshing. Recommended."
1,Deleted it from my Kindle without finishing,BEWARE -- SPOILER ALERTI work at a bookstore (lucky me) and someone came to the checkout with the book. The cover intrigued me and the customer said he heard it was a good book. I downloaded it when I got home and had to put it down at about the half-way mark -- right after poor Gretel is horrifically attacked and the village children were tortured. I saw no reason to take this book any farther.
1,No checkball locations,I needed information on rebuilding the tranny on my 1996 pontiac sunbird their is nothing ion it at all.
5,Finding our True Selves...,"This is one book that you will keep by your bedside, carry with you to the beach or to the office. In these stressful times being alone is often suspect, considered, somehow, a failure. Ruth Fishel gently takes us through our days, our fears and our longings and offers a means, through solitude, to find our true Selves. ""Precious Solitudes"" is a loving companion, reminding us daily that we are precious and our time alone is precious."
4,Sharp Carousel Microwave,"This is a remodel of a proven favorite. It's easy to understand and use, with predictable results. The new packaging is very modern and clean.My only disappointment is the LCD display. It has a very highly-directional viewing angle, focusing down to facilitate use by shorter people. If standing near the display, I must stoop to read it. Otherwise, this item deserves a perfect ""10""."
4,Good price for a microhood/convection oven combo,"This was such a good price for this particular item. I've compared the price online, and Amazon sold for by far the lowest price. Not to mention that there was no tax and no shipping fee.The reason with 4 stars and not 5 is that power of this microwave is not that high. I had one from Panasonic with 1200 watt, and that was very nice until blew up after 7 years of hard work. I wanted a high power one, but they were too expensive.The convection oven part is O.K. I've tested with some toffee cookies. Ones from my range/oven came out more moist inside and crisp outside. The convection oven dried the cookies, and they came out a bit too hard. Since I had only one oven before I bought this product, it is nice to have the second oven for the holiday seasons.My old microwave was on the counter, and now I have so much more counter space. That's the part I love most of all."
2,Annoying format,"When I saw the list of dietary restrictions on the cover of this book, I thought it would have lots of great things for my daughter, who has almost all the allergies this book supposedly addresses. The adjustments included in the recipes, however, are common sense, and only work if you have some of the restrictions. Ex- If you can't have dairy, use margarine, if you can't have corn or soy, use butter. I was expecting more recipies that don't need all the substitutes. The lay-out was also very cluttered, between the lists of possible alterations and dorky cartoons."
4,Johnson Level,"Does not give the best view of the object you are sighting at, but as a cheap, rough in sighting level, it works fine. It is compact and light."
3,lightweight and portable,the plastic viewfinder is a little wonky but not too terrible for an inexpensive model. wish it had a clip like another portable unit I have. the bubble sight isnt as bright as my preferred model for whatever reason.
4,"ONE OF THE ""ROUGHIES"" OF THE EXPLOITATION ERA","Where in the heck is Joe Bob Briggs? He was the mainstay of cult TV first on Fridays and then late night Saturdays. He brought us the best of the worst of the B flicks and a running trailer park commentary that would rival anything the original SNL writers threw at us. I miss him. Joe Bob hosted a series of these sixties cheapies which were a genre unto their own. Wild women in fishnet body suits being chased by brutes in polka-dot boxer shorts were the basic plots. In this gem, we follow the misadventures of a penniless and brainless chick lost in the Big Apple. Directed by Doris Wishman who brought Chesty Morgan to the screen (check out the kid in his bedroom in ""Serial Mom"") and used many aliases in her work. Rated 336 of ""The Sleaziest Movies In The History Of The World."" If you are a fan of this genre, you will howl with delight. If your fave film is ""The English Patient"", you may now move freely about the cabin."
5,Great Lubricant,"I use this mostly as chain lube on my motorcycle and bicycles, but it works equally well in other applications as well. It goes on wet, soaks in, and dries to a waxy like, non-sticky finish. It doesn't attract dirt like grease or other sticky lubes and is fairly water resistant."
2,No longer recommended for motorycle chains,"Be careful when you buy this product. The formula was changed in 2011 by Dupont and they no longer recommend it for use on motorcycle chains. Notice that the new label no longer indicates ""Dry Wax Lubricant"". See the article in webbikeworld:<...>"
5,conveniency and accuracy,"My wife wanted a new bathroom scale that was more accurate and we looked at alot of bathroom scales. Te reviews were important to us and so we also wanted to contribute a review. We have had the scale for about a month and it has always been accurate and it is very convenient to use. Some people complained about the tap, but for us it is just a gentle tap and it does not take long before the scale is ready for use. My wife works in a doctors office and she finds our scale just as accurate as they are. Love the scale and it is helping with our weight loss."
5,Plain & simple,"It doesn't have the body mass evaluations, but for my money, it's just what I wanted. It's consistant, easy to read, and large enough for my size 12's. Looks nice, too. What more could you ask for?"
1,Would give it less that 1 if I could,"Piece of junk. Cannot turn it on. Needs a button to turn on. At first, it would turn on after many repeated tries, but after less than two months it stopped working altogether. If you can get it to turn on, it works great - easy to read; but a scale that will not turn on is nothing more than an expensive door stop."
4,"Kayla's Review For ""Bastard Out Of Carolina""","""Bastard Out of Carolina,"" written by Dorothy Allison, is a book that shows a person what emotional and physical pain a child may go through to be loved. Young Ruth Anne (also known as Bone) is a Boatwright. A family that is famous for drunk men and picking fights. When Bone was born she did not fit in with her family, but her mother Anney covered her. Bone lives in Greenville County, South Carolina. Few years after she is born, Bone's mother marries ""Daddy Glen."" Glen is warm and gentle with Bone, but soon turns cold and hateful, Yet Anney needs Glen. Caught in this situation Bone's life turns upsidedown.I recommend this book because it shows what some children have to go through in their life. This book will twist all of your emotions preparing you for the ending that noone will ever forget! That is why i recommend ""Bastard Out of Carolina,"" written by Dorothy Allison."
4,Very good until the very end,"While reading this book, I recommended it to 3 people. After finishing it, I feel the need to call them and re-advise.The greatness here has been stated by many. But, SPOILER ALERT, the ending was horrendous. Really just the last few pages, when the mom rides off into the proverbial sunset with her husband, the rapist. I was sick with that image. I had to restrain myself from ripping the book apart. It's due back at the library.I think the message Allison was trying to give was that you can love someone despite his faults. And some other crap about not being able to choose between your lover and your child. But those parables do not apply here. The mom walks in on her husband RAPING her DAUGHTER. A few days later she abandons her daughter and leaves town with the husband. What a disgusting way to end a difficult, beautifully written story. I hope they both drove off a cliff a la Thelma & Louise."
4,Bastard Out of Carolina,A disturbing book that read like a true story. Brought to light the often untold story of dysfunctional familes and the secrets surrounding abuse of children by family members.
4,Moving Story,"When I originally read this book, I had borrowed a copy. After reading the book, I wanted a copy for my own library to re-read and share with others. It's a very moving story, filled with sadness, humor and hope."
3,I think I've read this before . . .,"Bone is a very fleshed-out, believable character. Her swinging attitudes and emotions are realistic, and I applaud Allison for writing the situations so frankly instead of trying to muffle them in ""sweet innocent child"" patina. The end is also realistic--it's not always a fairy tale.However, the story itself really doesn't offer anything new--perhaps because there have been so many books written on this topic, with the same narrators & points of view. Sometimes, if a character is distinctive enough, s/he rescues the story from being monotonous, but Bone doesn't quite. Though I like the way she is portrayed, she is still too similar to most other abused-child narrators (Bird from _Before Women Had Wings_ comes heavily to mind) for me to regard her as an individual. Despite the honest depictions of child abuse and its consequences, this book still somehow pales for me."
4,This one will haunt you...,"I would definitely recommend this book. The characters and the story haunted me long after reading it. It deals with some dark issues (it's not an uplifting tale), but Allison's writing is able to wring emotion from the reader in ways I've seldom experienced."
4,"Well-written, compelling story, and a fast read","I finished this book quickly, but it was no worsefor that; Allison's prose is incredibly readablewithout sacrificing depth. What's more, the storyis believable even if you've never experienced theenvironment she portrays, and never met peoplelike the characters in this book.This book isfairly short and definitely a fast read, but there's value in reading it more than once, and things you miss the first time around will be noticed the second time. Allison has taken rage and transmuted it into a powerfully moving tale. I'd recommend this book to anyone."
5,Here we go again (inside joke),"I read Bastard Out Of Carolina only after seeing the movie onHBO. I have to say that not only is this an intense book, but themovie itself was rather true to the book & gave faces to the characters which made you feel the human suffering even more. After reading the novel & started to cry (which is a very hard thing for me to do). I just wanted to take Bone, pick her up & hold her & say ""dont worry, everything will get better"". I know that sounds corney, but being a mother, this book made me think of how it would be if my little girl had to go through the same type of pain & suffering that was brought on Bone. Dorthy Allison, I want to thank you for writing a book that brings a serious & tragic topic to life. I hope that we all come away from reading this novel learning how to engage in human decency, respect, & love of our children. END"
5,Touching Story,This book was very moving and amazing to read. There is so much in the world that people have to endure everyday and it's amazing what this daughter had to survive. Very well written and touching. Definitely recommend.
5,Great writing at its best,"I loved Bastard Out of Carolina. Allison manages to capture poor rural living without being condescending and without slipping into dialect. The voice of the main character, Bone, is so convincing that you will not want to put this book down. While there is some difficult subject matter (as in child sexual abuse) don't all great works of fiction deal with subjects that may be repellant?This book is about poverty, family, growing up in the rural south, racism, love and abuse. If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book, this is not it. If you are looking for a well-written and powerful work of literature, Bastard Out of Carolina is as good as it gets."
5,Painful realism: an education that hurts but is worth it,"This book is unforgettable. Searing truths about an abused child in a tortured family. There are no easy answers, possibly because this book reads like biography, not fiction, and there are no easy answers in life. For anyone seeking understanding of how such things come to be, and what it does to the human beings involved, this is an amazingly educational book. For someone seeking someone who understands what they too have experienced, I imagine this book would be affirming. The main character does find a way to take care of herself, and some of her adults do come through for her, but the story, like life, is unfinished: you leave it knowing she has much work to do, and hoping she can do what is necessary. thank you Dorothy Allison for this gift."
5,A really powerful book,I read this book because there was a debate on whether or not it would be added into the local high school's curriculum and so I decided that I would like to see why people would have an objection to it. It is by far an excellent book with a strong message and I strongly recommend reading it. You won't be able to set this book down!
4,A deep and involving character study,"This is the first book I have ever read that made me cry. I mean that in a good way, because although this is a devasating story, the excellent writing brings you into the lives of the characters in such detail that their experiences become your own. Great detail that allows you to easily picture all involved. A wonderful work of fiction."
2,review #1,"the book is too violent to be a injoying read. the brutal family never lets up,it's very depressing though out. people who like ""grapes of rath"" will probly like this"
2,Subject matter a bit overdone,"After reading ""The Book of Ruth,"" ""Ellen Foster,"" and now ""Bastard Out of Carolina,"" I now know that I am no longer interested in books about white trash kids with well-meaning mothers who marry abusive drunks. My suggestion? Pick up Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"" or Mary Karr's ""The Liar's Club"" -- the true-life tales are more truthful, indeed."
2,Subject matter a bit overdone,"I now know that I am no longer interested in reading books about white trash kids with well-meaning mothers who marry abusive drunks. My suggestion? Pick up Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"" or Mary Karr's ""The Liar's Club"" -- the true-life tales are more truthful, indeed."
2,here comes another one.......,"Here's another book about some white trash kid being abused and leading a sad life. Is allison for real? Does she expect us to sympathize with characters so stereo-typed that they become unreal to the reader? The men in this book were all a bunch of drunks and if it were real life, they would have died of alcohol poisoning by chapter 3. Also, the book could shed a hundred of pages or so. There were many paragraphs that had to do with nothing. I would finish a whole paragraph and wonder what did it have to do with anything!?!?! And the masturbating bit got a little old. Sure she was abused, but did the author really have to describe Bone and her sister masturbating every other chapter? The author told how Bone shut herself off to the world. Well, the author shut Bone off to us as well. We don't get to see a lot of Bone's deepest feelings so we can relate to her. In other words, I don't think she was developed enough as a character."
4,Great but Disturbing Read,"This book and the Boatwright family are all in my head! I need to know what happened to Bone & the rest of her clan. Dorothy Allison wrote right to my heart. I appreciate the intensity of this work and her effort. it must have been a harrowing experience to write this story. I am glad I read this book but also wish I'd never met these people. I hate that love makes people do stupid and hurtful things. I never was able to sympathize or empathize with the mother, though. Read this book, you'll look at life differently."
4,"Harrowing, gritty novel about abuse and poverty","Dorothy Allison's novel ""Bastard out of carolina"" is a powerful, provactive story of an illegitatime child named Ruth Ann ""Bone"" Boatwright and the people in her life(her uneducated, but loving mother, her cruel, weak stepfather ""Daddy"" Glen who gradually escalates the violence until the book's shocking climax). The events of this novel are very true to life of the Deep South of the '50s, and I do credit Allison for telling us how it really is up until its bittersweet end, where our justice is not satisfied, but Bone has a chance to end the cycle of violence. Even though parts offend my taste, I still recommend this for its bluntness in telling the truth"
2,A bitter disappointment!,"After reading Allison's latest Cavedweller I couldn't wait to read this book. I quickly discovered that this book was not as well written. I found it boring and I could not wait to finish it, this was the only time that I perfered the movie over the book!"
1,bastard out of carolina,"I had read another book I had really enjoyed, so, this one came up recommended. I just couldn't get it to go anywhere. It seemed to drag, and was a struggle to finish. This one, hard as I tried, just didn't make the cut."
2,voyeuristic and cheap,"How can anyone have such a sick mind as tu publish a book that is so awfully voyeuristic, so cheeply depressing? Why is the American public so thrilled to hear about horror, detress and above all - this is what one reads about by every other novel written by a female author these days - child abuse? Why are all these readers so impressed by a book so unsubtle that you just know there must be more complexity than this. The author has picked and searched the most awful details, brought the story to such a climax of sadness that I was left empty, with no feeling but embarrassment at having not put the book down before the end."
1,This is entertainment?????,"This book was very well written, but very, very depressing. I wonder if it was autobiographical -- surely someone who had not experienced such a horrible upbringing could have imagined living the life this author describes. Guaranteed to make you feel bad!"
4,Speak The Truth,Amazingly written. A touching tale of a young girl growing up in the South. This story is written so well that you will cry because you would swear you were there. Let your heart free and read this book.
3,Bastard out of Carolina,"This story is so very, very sad. It is very well written and the characters are so well developed that they leap right off of the pages. Difficult at times because of the subject matter but a true story of survival. Well worth all of its critical acclaim."
5,It cannot be worse,"-than to grow up like Bone, a young girl from a poor Southern family, where both drinking and fighting are usual ways to spend your time.It is not her immediate family, however, who are the worst. The Boatwright family sticks together, poverty, alcoholism and violence aside. Bone is loved and, in a way, also protected by her family. But it is still a rough life, also for Bone's mother, Anney.When Anney marries Glen, things to seems to look brighter, but after a tragic event, Glen starts to take out his frustrations on Bone. It gets worse and worse, and the story is heartbreaking and very difficult to digest and understand.It is also a very fine piece of literature, and I cannot recommend this book enough."
5,A pool of tragedy,"I selected this book as an optional assignment recently while working on a master's degree in Southern culture. I have no regrets about my choice. Allison sucks the reader in through the eyes of Bone, a child that is the town joke as a babe due to the horrid red stamp proclaiming ""bastard"" on her birth certificate. Bone searches for identity and love through her family, the notorious Boatwrights, known for drinking, womanizing, and shooting, sometimes all at once. Bone also becomes the victim of a stepfather's lust and jealousy. Tragic moments and violent abuse grasp the reader by the collar and won't let go. Allison's prose is a pool of the unfortunate, exposing and in some instances celebrating the unspoken class, white trash. Do not deny yourself the pleasure of Bone, Alma, Raylene, Anney, and all the rest of the Boatright clan. They will make you laugh, tremble, cry and want to drink white lightning while listening to Patsy Cline records."
5,Gut wrenching,"When I was finished with this story, I threw the book across the room. My kids both looked over at me saying, ""Are you okay, Mom? What the heck?"" I just couldn't believe that I sat through it, willingly. It was heartbreaking and cringe-worthy and fantastic. I had read somewhere that this was semi-autobiographical. I can't believe that someone actually lived even a small part of this story. I suppose these things happen more than we can ever know. God bless the little children who must endure this kind of abuse. And, I suppose, God bless the adults who have survived it and must carry on with those memories. Well done, Dorothy Allison, well done.The character development, the setting, and the inner dialogue were all very well portrayed. I was really sucked into each and every moment, imagining the heat, the dirt, the smells, the tastes. I will definitely be searching for another book by her."
3,"Interesting, posthumous novel by Baker","I REALLY like JRB's work. Never subtle, often over the top - but certainly exciting. This book was reworked from a manuscript discovered after his death. Like Brassart mentions in the afterward, one can see the lack of orientation/tightness to the story and that is AFTER it has been edited and reworked. This one has a plot that travels all over the world, hits the media and celebrity between the eyes and never, ever stops. A little too cartoonish and over the top. The bodycount is absolutely amazing. Sadly, there is no real depth here to any of the characters and it's outlandishness, finally, does it in. All that said, it's worth checking out if you are a fan of his work."
5,Best Nutrition Book Out There!,"I borrowed this book from a friend to help me with the nutrition section of my A&P; course. After reading it, I'm going to have to buy my own. It is wonderful! I love this series, as these ""Made Incredibly Easy"" books are very easy to follow. The format is awesome.This book is divided into three parts:Part I: Intro to Nutrition (7 chapters)Part II: Assessment (2 chapters)Part III: Clinical Nutrition (9 chapters)No space is wasted. This book is crammed with useful information. There are a lot of charts, drawings, and other memory joggers. There is also several ""Quick Quiz"" sections, one for each chapter, consisting of five questions. It helps to reinforce what you just read.I highly recommend this book to anyone needing to know about nutrition. I love it and will continue using it throughout my nursing education and beyond."
5,Inspiring and Instructive Partner Yoga book,"I LOVE using this book. It is beautifully presented with clear instructions and excellent illustrations. Additionally the essays give guidance that transcends the mere physical practice of Yoga, which is more true to Yoga's intent. Learning the practices with a friend is great fun and allows for a unique context for being together. It can be challenging but the reward of staying with the process is tremendous, cultivating a deeper connection to your companion as well as a deeper sense of centering in yourself. I highly recommend this book to those that want to expand their practice of Yoga."
2,Not quite what I expected,"On the surface, from reading the inside flap, summaries and excerpts, I felt this could have promise. I liked the pictures and graphical design of the book. After reading most of the book, it turned out to be a somewhat amateurish essay, advocating an idealistic but unrealistic and impractical portrayal of the actual reality of intimacy and relationship, and the ""magic"" benefits of the author's style."
1,not much fun,"I rarely come across a book that I don't like or cannot find some redeeming value... until now.What a huge disappointment!I struggled with the first few chapters hoping it would get better, but I truly could not finish reading the entire book as the author seemed to be making it up as she wrote...I practice yoga and have for the last 3 years or so. Being an actor, yoga helps me relax and I thought that my husband and I could try it together. No such luck here.I am sorry but I would not recommend this book to others.As I stated previously, I rarely find a book that I won't finish. This will be one of those.... sorry."
2,Bizarre,"There is often some difficulty when a book is translated, but this book is more strange than most. It's not that there is no plot exactly, it that the meager plot there is doesn't make any sense."
2,Here There be Dragons,"A fairly entertaining monster movie, but the effects are somewhat questionable. Dean Cain seems to be making a lot of these movies where he is stuck in a prison/bomb shelter being stalked by a monster or supernatural force. (Do a search for ""Boa""). There is some strange camerawork with multiple split screens. It doesn't work very well."
4,Good Low-Budget Movie.,"I liked Dragon Fighter. The helicopter sucked. The plot was simple and easy to follow. The acting was great. I hate Dean Cain. I like him here. I thought that Robert Zachar was great as the mad scientist. I felt that he really did love his monster without being funny about it. He is an excellent non-famous actor and I hope he gets famous someday. Good movie, everyone was good in this."
3,"beware ""Aliens"" there is a new threat out there!","While cloning is the catch word of this millenium it appears that nature knows best anyway and highly speeds up the growth of certain species to fit with our limited atention spans,or is it just the movie length it had to fit?It appears that while Dean Cain is quite a good actor he is no acomplished aircraft mechanic( my son could fix a fuel line faster and has).This movie has it's moments and seems to move along at a decent speed."
1,Bad bad bad,"I don't think i've ever seen a worse film than this. The acting is bad, the special effects even worse and I can't find the words to descripe how much the script sucks. I don't know wether to cry or to laugh. Stay away from this film!!"
3,i hear theres a sequel in the making as well,"pretty cool digitalized dragon and a few good scenes. average movie for low budget. did have some cool scenes where there was multiple split screens going at once, think it even got up to 6 split screens for a couple scenes, guess they wanted to try somethin different to get peoples attention on this film. but overall a pretty good rental for a killer dragon flick. hopefully the sequel will be pretty good."
4,FIRE BREATHING FUN,"Director Philip Roth rises above the B movie status in this cleverly filmed sci fi movie. By using multiple screen shots and loading us with a cache of completely unbelievable characters, he focuses mainly on the genetically engineered dragon, and that's why this movie is fun.For a low budgeter, the dragon effects are very good; unfortunately, the CGI guys don't do as well with the helicopter scenes, but since the dragon is the star, who cares?Dean Cain gives another one of his earnest, good guy performances as the security guard who saves the day.The movie is fun to watch and we can predict the ending, but if you like good old fashioned fun, this one passes."
1,Absoutely Horrible,"This movie didn't deserve the 1 star that I gave it. I only put 1 star because you can't put zero. To start off with, my friend, who is an amateur film maker, can do better special effects. The front end helicopter shots were horrendus!! It was all 2-D and just not realistic. The shots of the dragon were a bit better, but hardly high quality.Now the acting was a big shaky. Dean Cain, who I respect as an actor, lost a lot of my respect from this film. During too many scenes it looked as if he was trying too hard to fit the part, and it just wasn't working.Well enough of my gabbing about how horrible this movie was. My advice to you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO RENT OR BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Low Budget but not bad,"This is a low budget film but it was surprisingly good for all that. Yes some of the props look phoney but not everyone has a budget of $60m. But i enjoyed this because it stars my favourite actor DEAN CAIN. He is a talented actor so why he takes roles in low-budget movies i don't know, to pay the rent for sure. But at least it keeps him in work.I was pleasantly surprised by Kristine Byers who co-stars.Having said that, low-budget movies at least provide work for the many actors/actress of all nationalities. Most of the cast were Bulgarian, which was the location for the film."
3,Not bad at all,I adore Dean Cain and will watch any movie he makes - low budget or not. This movie was better than I expected. I love the action and of course I love watching Dean Cain take charge to save the day.
5,"Buy it, read it - you will be glad you did!","If you have ever considered keeping a family milk cow but have no experience - this is the book for you. Common sense information on everything from choosing the breed of cow, what to feed, common medical problems, correcting behavior problems (if any), how to milk....on and on. Worth it's weight in gold!"
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is wonderful. Joann is a real genius when it comes to diary cows.I wasn't sure I could do this when I began to read her book, but she has given me the knowledge and confidence to keep a family cow.This book will make an excellent reference for my library. I will know what to do and when I need to do it.I really like her online Blog too. It provides a wealth of information on all things farm, and is made up of friendly helpful people who are into farming.Many thanks Joann you are the best!Donald Krueger"
5,Everything you don't know you need to know!,"This book covers at least a little bit about everything you need to know about having a cow and many subjects include great detail so you may never need another book. I bought several other books and could have just got this one! She covers feeding, housing, pasture, calving, caring for calves, sickness and desease, milking, using milk including recipes for cheese and yogurt. She didn't leave anything out of this book!"
4,"Great product, Great service, Great price. Thank you.",Sent as promised. The product was as advertized. The price was great. Perfect.
1,"Poor narration, weak stories","The stories are not very good, being written before Lovecraft developed his unique style.But the real problem here is the narrator. He has no feel for the material and significantly detracts and distracts from the stories. They should get an actor to read this material, not an ex-radio DJ. That might give it some redeeming quality."
4,A finishing touch for your Lackey collection.,"This book can read a bit slowly at times, but most of the stories are interesting and entertaining. It's a great book to get if you want to put the finishing touch on your Lackey collection, and it gives you some nice background on both Lackey and Dixon. I especially liked the story about the animal rights activists....it was very funny."
3,Interesting compendium of short stories,"This is a collection of stories Mercedes has written over the years. Some good, some just ok. None that really qualify as horrible, but also none that I considered great.Did have one that was later expandied into Bardic Voices Book 1 ""Lark and Wren"". Much of the story was translated almost word for word. For a writer it might be interesting to see just how little she changed, and yet she took a short story and turned it into a decent novel.If you love Mercedes work, this book will definitely interest you. Lovers of fantasy will also likely find at least one story to enjoy, there are several good ones and the bredth of topics should mean there is at least one story a reader will enjoy."
2,A waste of money,"It was obvious that Mercedes Lackey just threw together a pile of previous works. I am a big fan, but was sorely disappointed with this. Usually her work is full of adventure and relationships with so much more to make it an enjoyable release from reality. Sorry- this was not worth it."
3,"Well, funny...","...but the young director chooses the wrong path: Instead of concentrating on the interesting drama – a forced marriage and a witty way out of it – he squeezes too much comedic action into his flick: there are drastic, but supposedly funny beatings, timid trips to the sex shop and to a bizarre ""natural healer"" and of course several chase sequences. Most actors do well, including the non-pros, but the main role of Mans was written as a sparrow-brained body builder. There is way too much prophanity. Nontheless, i had my fun.I didn't see this as a multicultural comedy. For Lebanon, you could watch the ""chick flick"" Caramal (nice, but not very deep, taking place in a peaceful Beirut). My DVD of The Best Man's Wedding shows several very interesting scenes that were cut out from the final movie. On my DVD, the director's spoken commentary was in Swedish."
2,not much information,"If you don't have A LOT of martial arts experience, this video is pretty advanced. Showed some basic stuff to do with the fans, but I was expecting more ideas of things to do, how to build a elegant yet intimidating weapos form. That said, I like the fans and since the video have figured out that basically any move you do you can incorporate the fans."
2,BPA alert!!,"If you are looking at these b/c you own or are thinking of buying the Elan pump - note that it has been discontinued and the pump contains BPA! So, look at other pumps that are not made of BPA!!!!"
3,A Fourth Grade Teacher's Opinion,"I am a fourth grade teacher, and plan to offer a set of books that chronicle the fourth grade experience for my students' Literature Circles. To that end, I read Fourth Grade Celebrity. It's a little dated, but most fourth graders will recognize themselves and others in its pages. The book is a quick and humorous read, and I think my students will like it. The average fourth grader should find the readability level accessible; the vocabulary is not too challenging (for good and bad), chapters are short, and the pacing is brisk. There is no overtly offensive language (although two characters are referred to as ""a pain in the A"" [and I do mean ""A""; I'm not censoring here]). This is a pleasant little book; not great literature, but certainly not drivel either. I will include it as a Literature Circle choice."
4,"Dignity and despair, in black and white.........","Shelby Lee Adams book offers the reader a chance to glimpse a world that is real, is current and is so close by as to be uncomfortable. Through his photographs he has been able to capture uncompromising images of the Appalachian mountain people with terrible accuracy. Whilst their lifestyle and habits might challange the most open minded reader, the characters deep behind the oh-so-human faces tell a different story; one of a long history of a lifestyle that leads to no envy, no greed, just acceptance. Lee Smith's narrative captures in words what Shelby's does in black and white. It doesn't compromise, it doesn't back off, it goes for the jugular, and in that respect it is a book to buy, to keep and to treasure."
3,Great premise but horribly written...,"Hodgson's The Night Land (1912) is frequently cited as one of the great masterpieces of horror and fantasy fiction. In terms of premise and ideas (and to an extent the basic plot), I'd agree. However, the characterization (esp. of women) and the writing style of this novel is absymal- it's nearly unreadable. Hodgson uses a mock-medieval writing style for reasons known only to himself.I've read most of Hodgson's novels (4 out of 5) and this is easily the worst-written of them (Boats of the Glen Carig is similarly flawed)-and it's a near-fatal flaw. As far as I'm concerned, Hodgson's ""House on the Borderland"" (1908) remains his only masterpiece. In fact, I've read an interesting article which suggests that Hodgson published his novels in the reverse-order of their actual writing, which means that House would've been one of his last works, i.e., he improved with time."
3,"Good book, shame about the editing","This edition suffers from a multitude of printing errors; typos, missing lines at the top of pages, repeated paragraphs. Hodgson deserves better - take your business to a more careful publisher."
2,Interesting but flawed early science-fantasy,"I tend to agree with the second reviewer! Hodgson's bizarre world is fascinating but he has a weak idea of plotting and no concept of character development. I found the ending to be manipulative and absurd but the atmosphere is superb, better, really, than Jack Vance's treatment of the same idea in the otherwise-wonderful collection ""The Dying Earth"". I would strongly recommend Hodgson's ""The House on The Borderland"" for aficionado's of the weird."
4,Great Lost Classic,"This is one of the lost masterpieces of the twentieth century. This is a shame, because it is also the most imaganative ever written.It concerns the future. The sun has gone out. The stars have too.And the land is infested by monsters. Humanity is confined to a great pyramid. But, one man must venture into the Night Land to save his lost love.If you can get past the weird linguistic style, it's a great read."
1,"Lets be honest here, you're reading a 1-star review to see whats wrong with the book.","I picked up this book after seeing a drawn map of the Night Lands, and was amazed at the sheer imagination and wonderment that I felt going through it. The first half of the book did not disappoint me, wowing me with a practically ancient idea of science fiction, struggling with trying to describe things that he simply did not have the language for, like we have invented.Of course, after about the half-way point the entire book changes to how the author desperately wants to own his star crossed lover and have it be considered a natural state between genders. Pretty much from the 50% mark to the 85% mark(God Bless Kindle) is taken up with the character either obsessing over the desirable qualities of his lover, or being completely enraged that she is not an obedient servant. It honestly knocked me so hard out of the immersion, that I struggled to finish the book."
1,goodnightland,"a boring melange of mysticism, horror , & scifi. Even Hodgson's kindly friend Lovecraft called it overlong. Overlong? The thing drags the reader thru a boring journey across an ill-defined future earth, sharing countless boring food tablet meals with the hero? as he avoids monsters and seeks his lover, whom he has never met. You decide."
3,So-so,"Pascal Dollé is a good Euro/club DJ, but his track selection ultimately lacks the punch. On this ICU compilation he mixes mostly hardhouse/hardtrance tunes along with some trance. The tempo is kinda slow, and the tracks are rather forgettable. His Generation Trance 2 mix was also slow at points, but if you're going to mix hardhouse and hardtrance you need a more aggressive sound. 3/5 stars."
5,READ IT!,"A short time ago I was too busy to read, but recently being laid off has its perks. I was given the opportunity to read this book. What do I think? I think you'd be a fool not to read it. There is a strict attention to detail to the characters that you find in veteran writers, and it's not like the overkill you sometimes find. Extra bonus for me is that some of the scenes took place twenty minutes away from my house. All in all this book has done a lot to change me personally, the way I think about things, and I'm sure it would have the same impact on anyone else. SO READ IT!"
5,Hard to put down!,"It was great reading a book I could so completely relate to. I've read the ""beats"", I've read the ""hippies"", and I've read the early ""punks"", but until I read Salad Days, I'd never read a book about me, my friends, and our generation. Though I didn't always like our hero, I couldn't help feeling very connected to him and his story, and that's the key to any great book."
1,"sad, and not in a good way","Read this if you hate punk rock and wish to revel in it's destruction. Pointless whining by spoiled jerk who was lucky enough to join his favorite band, and paid them and their other fans back by ruining the band with self-indulgent noodling, then wrote this little yawn fest about it, thouroughly slagging all band members except his equally lame soon to be music professor cohort. Full of insights into one weenie's sweaty feelings of self importance, and love for a ballerina. I couldn't possibly be more sorry to have read this. Worse than Jack Chick. Way worse."
3,3.5 more like it...,"I had a hard time believing in a character who stood steadfastly to his beliefs through his teenage-early twenty-something years. I also had a hard time in believing in a teacher who was so upfront with his dislike for a student. I was also bothered that there was so much talk about parents in the first half of the book, and yet the parents are NEVER in the scenes.Those are the problems I have with the book. Other than that, it's a surprisingly accurate glimpse at the lives of me and quite a few people I know, despite growing up on the east coast in the 80s. If you were in the sccene, or had a band... well, you'll probably feel similarly.Its not that bad a book, but it does have its weaker moments. Its a quick read and not an unenjoyable book."
5,Austin Celebrity Profiles review,"I read Salad Days in two days. I think the reason I couldn't put it down was because it really kept me guessing. Most other punk books I've read (mostly non-fiction) had pretty much the same story, but Salad Days was definitely different. I really enjoyed the band's tour adventures. You can almost feel yourself riding in the van with the whole sweaty band and experiencing all the frustrations and excitement. In the end, it is the music that kept him going, it was the music that mattered most. I think a lot of us would agree with that."
5,"man, was it FUNNY!","Absolutely brilliant and very well executed. And it didn't cheese out, either. Truly, I think that it's an important read. I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it. I pretty much thought it was going to be a poorly written pamphlet of a thing, but what arrived was an extremely well crafted novel."
1,Disappointing to say the least.,"I heard great things about this novel, now I'd just like to get the hours it took me to read this back. The writing is amateurish, and the entire novel is plagued by mistakes any decent editor would have easily caught. The characters are underdeveloped and the dialogue is wooden and unbelievable. The constant name-dropping and scene-insider jokes get old very quickly and it seems that the author was trying way too hard to remind the reader that tis novel is set in the punk/hardcore scene. Don't waste your money on this..."
5,Move over Sallinger,"I only wish that this book was available when I was in High School.A great coming of age story for ""the rest of us""."
2,Experience and Excellence Not the Same,"This book is the work of a beginner in a lit sense and a veteran in the scenester sense. Unfortunately, the two don't come together as seamlessly as a reader might wish, but Charles Romalotti is sincere and obviously trying hard, so kudos in that department."
5,Perks of being a wallflower meets Catcher in the Rye,"Salad Days is such an incredible book. I felt it was great just for the simple referances it made to bands like bad brains and minor threat. the author is truly amazing at writing, so much though thaty i bought Rash, the next book in this series for 55 bucks, ( get copies while you can if you want to keep with the series!!) i am waiting for my copy in the mail now, but i simply cant wait just for the face that Frank, the main character makes another appareance. this book makes you feel as if these people are alive. Also reccomends: Coloring outside the lines: a punk rock memoir"
5,Great book,"I did not buy the book on amazon. I got it directly from the author. That being said, I love this book. The book is a very detailed story of growing up in the mid-west 80's punk scene. The book does a great job of describing the trials and tribulations of being young and misunderstood. If you are a fan of music this is a must read. The details that the author goes into describing the music, the bands, and venues, makes you feel like you were standing right with the characters. You cant stay young forever and eventually everyone grows up. This book really does show what it is like to get older in a punk scene. Its been about 10 years since I first picked this book up and I still love to read it"
2,"Amusing, but such poor writing!","While this book stirs up memories of blurry punk rock shows, the prose is cliche-laden, overwritten high school drudge. NO Midwestern kids talk like this. If Romalotti would drop the psuedo-hi-falutin' language, this could be a decent (though slighty cliched--think SLC Punk) story."
4,very well........,"The town that romalotti grew up in was Iola, Kansas......and I can assure you that neither his first nor last name on this book or any of the others is true. He went to Iola High School and was in his first real band with Dominick Haen called the FLOURESCENT CONDOMS.....Danny was and without a doubt still is a great guy, he did not have a mean bone in his body in high school, he liked to playfully pick on people....."
3,okay,"Well, this is a good book. I don't think Jessica should be upset because she has not started her period yet. Elizabeth is the older twin so she probably should have started her period first. I give the book 3 stars."
5,Panasonic ER389K Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer,"Simple, convenient shaver. Best feature: charges while plugged directly into the wall socket. Makes for easy storage."
4,Good trimmer at a good price,"No bells and whistles, just a quality beard trimmer at a very reasonable price. Compact, yet fits nicely in my hand. No recharger unit needed, as the trimmer plugs directly into AC outlet."
5,Panasonic Fine With Me,"Have had a beard for 40 years. This is my 8th or 9th trimmer and it's as good or better than the others. Handy because the plug is built into the trimmer, so no need to make room for a separate base. Had read that it was easy for the trimmer guard to slip from its setting, but that is not the case. Would (will) buy it again."
4,This works quite well,"I purchased this to trim a beard, more recently a very short beard. I have been pleased with its performance, and the battery recharges quickly."
2,Maybe I got a lemon!,"I dug my first version of this trimmer that I used for 2 to 3 years before it died not accepting a charge. Next, I ordered a replacement assuming 2 to 3 years was marginally acceptable. Yet, my second version of this trimmer has died not accepting a charge after only 6 months of use and about 6 uses! Damn, whats up with the batteries on this thing?"
4,A good trimmer,"I have owned several beard trimmers over the years and this is a good one, however I am only giving it 4 stars because I don't think that it is a great trimmer. The main negative thing that I have against this trimmer is the height adjustment - the lowest setting is not quite as low as I prefer. On my old Norelco trimmer, I was using setting #3 - so the lowest setting on this trimmer is not quite as low as the 3rd lowest setting on my old trimmer.Other than that relatively minor gripe, the trimmer is very good - I particularly like the AC adaptor built into the trimmer."
5,Beard Trimmer!,I have had this Panasonic beard trimmer for about five years. I allways ran the charge down completly before recharging it again. Holds a charge a long time! Always worked great. I just had to buy a new one because my dog ate it! So I guess she enjoyed it to.
4,Quick Buzz,Works great - hods a charge for a long time. This item seems to get used by everyone who comes to the house.
4,Terrific Panasonic Beard Trimmer,"So far, very good performance from this trimmer. I'm still on my 1st 6-hour battery charge! Only wish is that there was a slightly shorter setting than the lowest one (of 6) that it provides. For purposes of maintaining a beard, I can't imagine using the very long settings. But it's a good cut and pretty easy to clean."
3,Panasonic ER389,"Six position, cordless beard trimmer. Great product for about 2+ years, until the battery stopped holding a charge. No replacement parts could be found. Typical Panasonic product: just outlived its warranty."
3,not good for a very close trim,"i recently bought this product and firstly the pros:- good trimmer, trims with less pulling and pain.- easy to charge and good quality blades.cons:- for a guy like me who would like to keep no more than 1.5 or 2 weeks old beard, this trimmer cannot give me the exact adjustment i want for my length. but this can be a great one for greater beard thickness. so that setting at level 1 is just not enough for a week old beard."
2,My previous ER389 lasted 2 years,"I just ordered a new ER389 because my current one died after a little over two years of use. It was a nice little trimmer while it lasted, but I really don't think I should be filling landfills with dead trimmers every two years. If a frequent problem with these devices is that the batteries die, I'd be happy with a long-lasting trimmer with an old-fashioned power cord. By the way, I previously owned a Wahl battery-only portable trimmer and a Wahl AC trimmer, and they both had short lives."
4,Great Product,Have been buying and using this simple compact trimmer for years. The only problem is that they stop working after about 2-3 years when the warranty is already gone. The repair center replaced one once with a completely different model. They are so inexpensive though that 2-3 year use makes them almost disposable.
3,Beard trimmer,I bought this for my husband to keep his beard shaped. He says it works all right but does have a tendency to pull his beard some. Thought the blade might be too fine.
1,No Staying Power,"This is the third Panasonic beard trimmer I have owned and by the WORSTE. The battery failed to charge after only two years. The previous models lasted from five to seven years. Panasonic has evidently cheapened their product line and the quality is just not evident as it once was. Too bad, I hate having to switch brands but am forced to over this lack of reliability."
5,Panasonic ER389K Beard Trimmer,"My Husband has used this brand of trimmer for years, and even though they have changed small details of this trimmer it still remains the best on the market. He has tried many other brands, and so far this is the best!!!!"
4,A good trimmer at a reasonable price,"I have used this trimmer for 10 years for various looks from full beard to tightly groomed mustache. The trimmer performed well at trimming my medium density coarse beard. The beard length guide works well, but will move if too much pressure is applied. With the length guide removed, the trimmer edges hairlines wonderfully, giving the beard a crisp outline. I especially like the internal charger. The plug slides out of the side of the trimmer and you plug it in the wall. No other charger pieces to keep track of. After 10 years of use, two times a week, the battery no longer holds a charge, and can not be replaced, but after 10 years, I can't complain."
3,Panasonic doesn't get it,"I used to have one, it does a great job and quickly, had to throw it out when the ""rechargeable"" battery would not recharge anymore and no one had a replacement. Has anyone told Panasonic yet that NiCad batteries stink?"
1,wasn't very sharp out of the box new,"I have a few beard trimmers and this one doesn't cut well at all even when it was brand new. Perhaps it is defective, but be warned. I have a one-year old norelco beard trimmer which works so much better."
5,An Incredible Mix of Fantasy and Japanese History,Genpei is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is a mix of fantasy and Japanese History. Kara Dalkey has written a great novel of the 12th century Japanese Genpei Wars.The Genpei war was a civil war in Japan between the powerful Taira and Minomoto clans for control of the country. The winner of this war would found the first shogunate in Japanese history.Anyone who enjoys historical fiction or James Clavell type stuff will love this book. I especially enjoyed how the Japanese Shinto Kami spirits took life in this book giving it the fantasy angle.What a great novel. This is well worth the time and the money. This book is a must buy.
3,History,"If I am not mistaken, this book is meant to be a history book, not a novel for entertainment. (?)Then if that is the case, it's not supposed to be ""fantastic"" or tell stories, it's supposed to give accurate fact and detail as genuine historical record. If you are looking for a sensationalized literature book based upon the Gempei war, then read ""Tale of the Heike""."
5,YUM,"This is my favorite taco sauce. Just tastes the way taco sauce seems it should. I'm not a big fan of chunky sauces and this is nice and smooth. Has the right amount of seasonings. Hot, but not too hot, just a little kick. I use it on tacos, quesadillas, to dip chicken in, fajitas."
4,At last! A natural singer!,"Anna's voice is a pure delight. The tone and timber are exquisite. But it's her effortlessness that captures the listener. When I listen to her voice, I don't hear someone ""singing"" as much as I hear an honest voice expressing itself. Anna outsings most of the female 'vocalists' on the market today without ever OVERsinging. In a word, she's tasteful.All this is enhanced by that fact that she's a wonderful spirit. I highly recommend that you attend a show and take the time to meet her. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had to sing with her and the time we've spent together. I can never hear her voice or think of a visit with her that I don't smile.There's an old saying, ""People may not remember what you did or what you said but they'll always remember how you made them feel."" Anna and her music make me feel wonderful."
2,"Very pretty, but the stick pin is huge","This pin is even prettier than the picture. The only problem, and it is a problem, is that the choice of the stick pin is poor if you plan to use this on any type of fabric that has a tighter weave (suiting, blouses). It would be good on loose weave sweaters, or perhaps wool, but unless the back pin is revised to make the tip rounded and the actual width of the needle much narrower (say like the size of a small eye sewing needle), it's not practical for wearing because it will leave large holes in your clothing. Too bad!"
5,Firearms cleaning and maintainance,this is a very well written book. i found it easy to follow with lots of pictures. this makes firearms cleaning easy and safe.
1,An Indespensable Tool!,"This book and all the others in the series are invaluable to the professional gunsmith, firearms hobbiest, or the casual gun owner who just likes to ""see how things work"" but can't always quite remember whether this little spring went in here, or over there."
4,smooth shaver,"after going through a braun and a noreco shaver, this panansonic is the best i've used so far. the ES8068N is silky smooth and cut very close. the blade heads osillate 13,000 times which is about twice the movement of the most comparable shavers. given that you can also shave wet with shaving gel adds another dimension if shaving dry irrates your skin. clean up is a snap; just put a little liquid soap on the blades, turn the shaver on so it lathers up and rinse it off... that's it!although the battery issue has been addressed (it's nicad and therefore has a charge memory), i can't understand why panasonic is using a nicad battery with a new product -- it's not like it's a cheap entry level shaver. it seems silly that with an induction charger, it's not using a Li-Ion or at least a decent NiMH battery. for this inconvenience i've subtracted one star."
2,Was great until it died @ 10 mos,"Well, I really like these razors in terms of shave, but they just don't last. My first one lasted 14 months (dead battery), this one is my second and it died in 10 months (in this case, some kind of weird electronic problem).So if you can afford a new razor every 10 months I would give it 5 stars, but most of us feel we shouldn't have to."
1,Panasonic won't service it!,"Beware, I just tossed my third one of these in the garbage. The batteries get to the point where they can't be charged anymore, and even Panasonic's OWN service center in Cyrpis, CA turned me away at the counter telling me that after the warranty expires they won't service the shaver, even for a fee. Don't buy this unless you're williing to buy a new one every year or so when the battery dies."
2,LEAKS OUT OF THE BOX,i ordered the shocks and they leaked right out of the box. i changed the seals as per the instructions and they still leaked.not happy at all. not to say they took almost 2 weeks to show up.
1,wrong color,I ordered this part and it was suppose to be orange and when I got the product it was pink I ordered it for a guy not a girl I didn't want at pink shock absorber set I wanted the orange one at least let Me pick the color not you.
1,Another Gift that was Unappreciated,"I ordered KINGDOM CROWN for my husband, who is an avid reader. I never read the book. When I asked him for a review, he couldn't remember the book, so I gather it wasn't very well written or interesting."
3,OK for quick reference,"It lists about everything. It gives the table or view name and the column name and type. For the most part, it gives a one sentence description for the table/view. That's the extent of the details."
3,A bigger defeat than Stalingrad.,"Three years after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Front was still holding and the Soviets were still stalemated there. During the same time as the Normandy Invasion, Soviet forces made hints at the southern front and then delivered the knock out blow against Belarus in the Center Front. Hitler ordered his generals not to give up any significant territory and the result was 300,000 soldiers (28 divisions) being surrounded and destroyed. Hitler's generalship was indeed faulty. The campaign was called Operation Bagration and it was a larger disaster than Stalingrad. It destroyed the foundations of the German Army and shortened the war.This is a nice read about an unknown operation. Few in the West know what the Russians did in defeating Nazi Germany. This book shows how the Soviets took on the bulk of Hitler's forces and won. This book describes the military aspect of this campaign. Lots of maps to show the progress of the campaign."
1,No Music,I couldn't do this video for more than 2 minutes because I couldn't hear the background music. I personally need to the music to keep the pace and I don't know of any other of her DVDs where you don't have music. I think it was there but so very very faint that it wasn't audible to viewers just to the cast. BORING!!
2,Disappointing as a biography,"I am a mathematician and know Goedel's work fairly well. I bought this book to learn more about Goedel as a person, and I was disappointed. Although any biography necessarily presents an incomplete picture of its subject, this book offers little more than a sketch of the man. I had hoped for something more thorough. The book may be of more interest to those who do not already know Goedel's work, but my impression was that it covers that material less well than other popular texts on the subject."
5,Biography: no -- Look at his great theorm: YES!,"I got to look at the book at a bookstore before I bought it so I knew I wasn't getting a biography. This book is a look at his theorem with comments about his life thrown in to put the work into some human context. For a thurough description of the theorem with a gentle human touch this is the book for you. Casti et al. does a great job of making tough ideas readable. If you want to know more about the theorem that turned mathematics on its head this is it. Not perfect (less talk about cake :-) ) but fun, readable, educational, A shame it is out of print."
3,At Best An Overview,"This book seems to be put forth as a biography of Godel--at least, that's what I thought I would be getting. As a physics and mathematics teacher, I am very interested in this man who revolutionized 20th century thought. However, only a portion of this already very slight book, is biographical material about Godel. So, if you are looking for a real biography, look elsewhere.Instead, this book briefly covers Godel's life, briefly covers his work, and briefly covers a few of the effects Godel has had on current thought. In that sense, it is not bad. A person who understands very little about modern mathematical thought but has an interest might find this book digestable and learn a bit. Others are not going to enjoy this book. People with strong backgrounds in mathematics are going to find it too weak and people with weak backgrounds in mathematics are going to find most of it indecipherable."
2,Not the real Gödel ?,"Sorry, but this book was somewhat a disappointment for me. The authors for the most part keep personal life and work of Gödel separated, instead of seeing them as a unity. A biography has to be the best of both worlds in my opinion. That's what makes the work of a biographical writer a difficult task. Maybe one of the two authors did the biographical part, the other one the mathematical ? And of course, everything about Gödel is great, brillant and alltogether grand. I am missing a critical view on his lifestyle and his view on music e.g.. Appearently the author of the biographical part was so in awe of Gödel, that he didn't dare to critisize anything about Gödel. Ironic, since Gödel stands for the idea, that you are allowed and even have the obligation to question everything to get to the bottom of the truth of things.I am still waiting for the real biography of Kurt Gödel."
5,JUST A GREAT!,"Some brands craps out, fail recording or take an extra time when you are copying multiple CDs at a time.But this brand, I record 10 at a time. It records fast and so far only one came out bad out of 500 CDs.In my book, that's an excellent.JLo, Los Angeles"
3,"Great content, but poor picture quality.","The content is great, filled with information, history and wildlife. I appreciate the time and detail spent on each subject. However, I consciously had to use my imagination to grasp the beauty of these wonderful places because of the ""grayish"" picture quality. It was quite distracting."
5,Great advice for a weary world,"The advice I found in this book has changed my life, too. Somebody told me I should read this when they caught be dragging around filled with worry. What can a little book do to change that I asked and they said well, just read it and see. The insights in this book have been just amazing. Homer teaches through stories that are fun to read but after you're done, you just sit back and go I really see that. I really, really do. Honestly, I've spent money on a lot of these selfhelp do better kind of books but the way Homer does it, I think I really got my money's worth this time."
4,Always a fan,"Always a fan of Homer Hickam... So I am not sure he could ever write something that I wouldn't like. His whole life, is just inspiring, and when he puts pen to paper he brings his own experience to life. Just exellent."
2,Sara,I got this for my husband. He started to read it but it wasn't what he thought it was going to be about. He was not interested. I think he said it was more like a motavational book.
5,My Favorite Christmas CD,I found this CD years ago and bought it not knowing anything about Eric Rigler or Scarlet Rivera. The music is absolutely beautiful. Both Rigler and Rivera play masterfully and I love the selection of carols. So delighted to see this available and encourage anyone who loves the haunting beauty of celtic music to purchase this.
5,BEAUTIFUL AND SOOTHING,"Although the music and songs are directed at the Christmas holiday season, there are many other songs that cause me to listen to this CD throughtout the year, e.g.: ""Waltzing Matilda,"" ""Greensleeves,"" ""Ava Maria,"" etc. This is a wonderful album with Uileann pipes, violins, and other instruments all blending together to produce a most enjoyable CD, which I now list as one of my favorites. Very relaxing and soothing music."
1,Waste of money,"Save your money.... do not purchase this book. You can find more information online for free. Unbelievable rip off. I do not think I can give this so called ""book"" away."
1,Not good,"Horrible, no bump, caught on fire after 2 days. Waste of money buy a alpine type r. It bairly mad a difference over my stock speakers"
4,"Great speaker, good value, but beware of impedance issue!","I bought this speaker to replace my $270 JL speaker that blew out after five years of use. This speaker kicks just as hard and sounds just as good as the JL. I can absolutely tell no difference. I should have bought this one first!My only gripe is the impedance. When I bought it, it was advertised as simply a ""4 ohm speaker."" What I actually received was a speaker with two 4-ohm voice coils. That means I can either run them in parallel and get 2 ohms, or series and get 8 ohms. What I wanted was 4 ohms, which is not possible with this speaker.Fortunately, my amp can handle a 2-ohm load, BUT my amp can put out 600 watts at 2 ohms, and this speaker can only handle 400. So I just have to be careful not to turn the gain up too high, or I'll blow out the speaker. I wanted a 4-ohm speaker because my amp puts out 400 watts @ 4 ohms, exactly what this speaker can handle. Oh well.Just putting the warning out there for you."
5,Next Stop - Daytime TV,"Business travel sometimes lands you in a hotel with few channels, none of which have anything worth watching. So what do you do after checking email? Hoepfully you'll have something good to read with you - like this book. My fiction reading leans toward mysteries, so it is not much of a stretch for me to find a de-bunking book interesting. These are not really new pieces for the author - really a collection of previously published articles. The magazine legnth and style means each is self-contained and easy to digest - perfect after a 10-hour day at a client. What comes through is just how many whacky ideas are out there. And how a bit of science and a small measure of logic combined with a questioning attitude can help keep you sane. I don't watch daytime TV even when I am home during the day - but I doubt the author is considered a good bet for any of those shows that make their ratings based on the folks that believe that stuff."
1,Not for the serious thinker,"While the debunking of pseudoscience is a worthy exercise, this book takes a naive and superficial approach. A typical chapter offers a scanty outline of a theory interspersed with sneering remarks. This hardly consitutes a logical attack on pseudoscience. Rather, it is exactly the kind of emotive prattle that the author claims to abhor."
5,Martin Gardner is a National Treasure,"At the age of 89, Martin Gardner is still debunking pseudoscience. The essays I found most enjoyable and enlightening are the two on Freudianism and the one on Alan Sokal's Hilarious Hoax. Perpretrated on the scientific ignoramuses of an indecipherable academic journal, physicist Sokal's hoax claimed, among many other absurdities, that ""the axiom that two sets are identical if they have the same elements is a product of 'nineteenth-century liberalism.'""Although it's hard to agree with Gardner on everything--I, most certainly, do not--I find it hard to imagine a thinking person who would not respect him and his work. He seems to have something interesting to say about almost everything. He may be a member of a vanishing breed, but I sincerely hope not."
3,a little disappointed,"I wanted to like this book, as I tire of hearing and reading about people all around me expressing interest in literally incredible (not credible) stories and beliefs. I must say up front that it's been over a year since I read it, so I cannot go into detail. But my one clear memory is that I felt Mr. Gardner spent too much time expounding on each absurd or flimsy belief, rather than on taking that belief apart and explaining *why* it's absurd or flimsy. It was worth reading, but left me wanting more."
1,not impressed by the lazy research,"He talked about mad cow disease being caused by a ""virus."" It's not caused by a virus, it's caused by prions. If he had bothered to do any research whatsoever he would have learned this.I was very disappointed in this book. He was supposed to be ""debunking pseudoscience"" but instead he just sort of laughed off some of the subjects. That is not ""debunking"" it is ""mocking."" Making fun of something is not the same as debunking. If he had put in a little more effort into researching the book and writing out why something is not factual instead of just scoffing, it might have actually delivered what the cover promised. Why not just call it, ""Cocky Smart Guy Makes Fun of Unscientific Things?"""
5,Worth the purchase,I've gone through 3/4 of the 100 CDs and haven't had a problem yet.I mainly use them for data CDs so I can't really comment on the audio part. They've worked great for me and I'm currently buying another pack.
4,I must be old if I remember the first season.,"""Murder She Wrote"" has always been fun even from the first season. These two episodes were typical, light-hearted mysteries with celebrity guest stars.""Murder She Wrote"" is still a lot of fun. It's a nice change from today's gory shows."
4,"Pretty good read, but nothing earth shattering","This book is a pretty good read in that it outlines some of the issues surrounding being an artist in today's society. It is more cursory than comprehensive. Basically it points out the issues but doesn't really delve into them very deeply. If you are already an artist it won't give you that much more insight than you probably already have, however it will serve to point you in thinking in the right direction.For the price I guess it's worth reading. I cannot recommend it as a 'must buy' but I also cannot say stay away from it."
4,The View Is Good,I appreciated Orland's view and comments. It just helped me pause to think about what I do and why I do it.
5,Feel good reading.,Easy to read and supportive of the artist experience.Art is a very personal expression and not always of universal acceptance.
3,Art Anxiety,"I liked this book, though I didn't think it was as meaningful (at least to me) as Art and Fear. I related quite well to some of the chapters, and thought others were just written for the sake of filling up the pages."
3,"505 scale pan, weight issue","While I can't complain about the quality of the construction of the pan, I did have a significant issue with it. Somehow, when moving, the moving company lost the pan from my old 505 scale. This replacement pan was too heavy for the scale. I was unable to adjust the scale wheel enough to zero the scale with the pan on it. The pan was a 4.5 grains too heavy. So rather than attempt to weigh powder charges and subtract 4.5 grains each time (a big issue when loading 6.6 grains of Unique for 44 Specials, for example) I ground and filed away metal from the outside upper edges of the pan until I was able to zero it on the scale. This may have been needed because my scale is old (late 80s), I'm not sure, but if I had this trouble others may as well."
3,Revelation of a world of pain,"Of Love and Shadows took me by surprise as a book that opened the eyes of an African American college student to many horrors and unspeakable crimes against humanity taking place in Chile under Dictator Pinochet. I was very pleased with the way reading at times captured my heart, by immersing me into the subject matter intimately. Ms. Allende tells the tale of lives that were taken, changed and controlled through acts of evil, evil that controlled the innocent people of a nation. The revelation of events that took place in Chile as told by Allende, lets the world know of the wrong, the torture that took place for many years. Allende does a superb job of leading the reader in, and teaching history a part of history that is sure to be remembered, especially by the families of those who were subjected to undue cruelty. Allende's informative story telling approach definitely reaches the hearts and minds of all who read Of Love and Shadows, regardless of who they are."
3,the movie is better,"In Isabel Allende's ""Of Love and Shadows,"" the ""shadows"" are the dark horrors of a military dictatorship in South America. This is another book that seems to have lost something in the translation. The language feels foreign, along with the culture and setting of the book. The planned marriage, the strong connection to one's roots, despite the ghastly events that take place there, and the almost whimsical love story were difficult for me to relate to. The descriptions of the regime's brutality seemed detached and did not have much emotional impact. Perhaps the objectivity was intentional in order to convey the seeming complacence of people living in oppression, despite the terror."
2,Overall Pretty Good,"Somewhere, in a fake Latin American country, Irene and Francisco meet and fall in love in the midst of a military dictatorship. They discover murderous plots surrounding numerous characters that at first seem inconsequential but become very important. Unfortunately at times the plot is slow moving and uninteresting, but the overall take on the book is pretty good. I wouldn't read another Allende book for pleasure though."
2,disapointing,"I loved The House of Spirits and Daughter of Fortune, but Of Love and Shadows was disappointing. It amounted to a pretty predictable cheesy romance novel, rather than the complex, intriguing stories Allende is capable of."
2,Should not be compared to The House of Spirits,Those who read this because of The House of Spirits would be disappointed. It simply lacks the steam to move people.
4,Of Love and Shadows review,"Of Love and Shadows was a great book. I have never been to South America or known the things that took place there under a dictatorship. I love the books becuase it helps me imagine in great detail where these events took place. It takes me to this place ""Of Love and Shadows"". I thought it was a great book."
3,No Marquez,"This work was recommended to me by a friend after he heard me going on about Gabriel Garcia Marquez's work, ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". I cannot actually tell too much about this book, as I never finished it, not even halfway. The above book by Marquez is my all time favorite work, and so my expectations were very high when I opened the cover of this one. I was, however, deeply dissappointed - this piece, in my estimation, lacks the passion, the poetry and the intellect of Marquez's work. I honestly do not see the comparison at all.For those seeking out some spicy and soulful latin flavor, I would direct them first to Marquez's masterpiece. Of a lesser caliber, but still quite enjoyable are Luis Sepulveda (first) then Mario Vargas Llosa and Juan Carlos Onetti."
4,good one,"If you looking for a simple remote for lock and unlock your car this a great one, its easy to program it. I recommend it"
1,You feel like you didn't even shave,"I tried this at short, medium, and long hair lengths, both in and out of the shower in an attempt to make a fair judgement. In short, it doesn't work. You feel like you didn't shave yet after you've finished. It feels like 2 day old stubble after you shave with it, which is not my idea of shaving my legs. I returned it immediately and would not recommend to anyone."
1,doesn't work,"In the shower it kind of works if you use shaveing cream and have a lot of time, but it is not a close shave. It wouldn't even cut my hair when I tried to use it dry. I started using my husbands Norelco it works great. I just wish it was a wet/dry so I could use it in the shower"
1,"If I could give a rating of ZERO, I would!!!","I would have better results shaving with a butter knive.In other words, this shaver doesn't shave a hair."
1,Does not provide a close shave,"First of all, my shaver came with a charger that did not work. I tried the shaver, until the power was gone, since I couldn't recharge it. This shaver did not give a close shave at all. When I finished shaving part of my leg, even using the pop up trimmer for extra help, my leg still had stubble all over it.I use Wahl's Lady's Choice rechargeable shaver now. It's great, and is the best electric shaver I've ever used! It makes my legs as smooth as shaving with a disposable razor. It is great for those who need to shave daily, but can't use regular razors everyday due to irritation. It also comes with 3 different interchangeable shaving heads. The only downside is that it is not wet/dry. Quit wasting your money and take my advice...try the Wahl Lady's Choice regchargeable shaver. It's awesome."
5,A childhood favorite,"This book was a favorite of my children's in the 1970s & 80s. I looked everywhere to find it and never could, so was very happy to find it here. The story is very well written and has a good lesson for young kids too. My son, whom the book was bought for, is in his 40s now and was very pleased to receive this book. The other day his young daughter read it to me on Skype because we live over 1,000 miles apart. It was a good find for all of us and it was brand new, in plastic, especially for a book written in 1970. Thanks so much!!"
2,Not the Bible!!,"The book claims to be the Bible, which to me means that it is the authority on the subject...it isnt! To its credit, the book does cover a lot of material and gives you a basic understanding of the components of Access. However the major problem is that the book offers very few examples. There is a CD that comes with the book, but why do I need to reference a CD for every detai?! In fact the CD isn't referenced much in the book at all.This book would be a thousand times better if the author, instead of making the book like 1300 pgs long would get to the point and give clear examples. I found myself understanding terms and definitions but when I tried to apply them to building a database I had no real applied foundation. I am therefore looking to other books to supply what this doesn't."
2,No structure at all,"There's something strange about this Bible series. I already bought quite a few books of this series. They are very attractive by their looks, usually very thick and most of the time a bit disappointing. This one really is. I have rarely seen a computer book that is so badly structured as this one, I really do not find my way in it. Not the book to choose if you want to learn access, not even good as a reference book, no structure, no depth. I really wonder why it is so successful..."
2,This is okay,"I pick up on software packages pretty quickly, but I find this book to be more advanced for my taste. It took me a while to find out how to do something pretty simple. I had to purchase another book for quick reference look ups."
3,All that glitters is not gold...,"Beautiful cover, 1500 pages and 2 CD ROMs! What a bargain eh? Except for busy people attempting to develop real time and real- world applications quickly. I imagine it has everything you need to know about Access 2000 - but I become infuriated with their on-going (forever) example of a pet hospital of all things! I'm attempting to set up a marketing budget and do not want to have to play around with dogs, cats etc. and their need for anti-tet shots. I do not have the time nor inclination to try to imagine what their examples would translate into in the real world. Enuff already!! Use the example for a chapter but get into business examples and a variety would be helpful. Arghh!"
1,Access 2000 Bible,"I was looking for a good CheckWriter program so I purchased the Access 2000 Bible so I could have the latest CheckWriter 2000 program that comes on the CD with the book. The CheckWriter 2000 program on the CD WILL NOT run correctly. databasecreations.com did send me 2 replacements and neither of those versions run correctly either! You can't print a new check. You've got to exit the CheckWriter window, then reopen the window, then find your check, then it can be printed. I notified databasecreations 3-4, 3-5, and 3-6 via email about this problem, and no response has been received as of 3-21. I'd like to locate a good CheckWriter program, but this is not it. My advice is: don't buy the book for the CheckWriter Software!"
2,Only good if you want REEEELY basic stuff.,"Don't get me wrong, it's well written, but it's a superficial coverage of all topics. Nice overview, but even for someone brand spankin new to access, this coverage will seem a little condescending."
3,Not solution oriented enough,"I've been using this for a few weeks and like the accompanying CD which allows you to search the entire book easily. What I don't like is that too often I found myself struggling to find solutions that existed but were not documented. Like what do you do when you've set up a report and want to add a field that's not on the Field List. The trick is to go back and expand the query the report is based on to include that field but you won't find that in here. Instead you might (as I did) struggle with Text Boxes that allow you to build expressions based on the field you want, but you come up with an error message. Also they are so proud of their sample database that you find yourself having to go into it all the time to understand their explanations. I find myself, instead, turning to Access's online help for much of what I should find more nicely explained in this book, both with and without the examples."
3,Definately NOT the Bible,"I think the title of the book is a bit of a misnomer. When I think of the 'Bible' I think of something that is a very comprehensive and authoritative reference. This book is NOT that. It introduces you to the BASICS of Access and never really does the advanced subjects justice. The book won't actually make a very good reference because of the style it is written in. I was looking for a book that covered intermediate to advanced material and this book is more of a basic to intermediate book. Roger Jennings' book ""Special Edition Using Access 2000"" is the better book for the intermediate to advanced user."
1,Look elsewhere,"For a book of this size, it's amazing that I never find what I'm looking for in it. I guess that's because the book is mostly fluff. As another reviewer stated, I end up finding my answers in the on-line help.For example, this morning I needed to learn about Access security. It's not even mentioned in this book. That's unforgiveable for a ""Bible.""Yesterday I needed to look up record locking. The ""Bible"" has practically no references to it. I was far better served by the Access on-line help.The back cover says ""Inside, you'll find complete coverage of Access 2000.""Well, I'm still looking."
1,Most definitely not a Bible!,"Don't buy this book, it's worthless for a beginner and for an advanced user also. It's too complicated and poorly organized for a beginner, it randomly introduces a lot of unexplained new terms, which make it's reading more that frustrating. For an advanced user (I became one after reading a ton of other books) it's superficial and does not concentrate on the real aspect of data base design and implementation."
2,"A beginner's book, and not even remotely a bible","This book disappoints a lot due to its promising title. It covers the basics adequately, with step-by-step instructions and lots of screen dumps. There are, however, no VBA code examples, and in my view no information on professional database development. I could hardly imagine developing a sturdy application of some size without using at least some code and impose some limitations to what the user might do. This is a introductory book that needs some reality check on what a real application is, and given its present title I cannot recommend it."
2,Superargo beyond pan and scan!,The movie ia as silly and fun as it gets but the print used for this dvd was so panned and scanned that there was literally scenes where you know people are there talking but all you see is back ground. It takes some getting used to. The movie was what one should expect of a sixties early seventies euro film. The plot is silly and the actors are over the top. The quality of the transfer is a real bummer!
5,Intelligently put,"It seems to me that there are still people who don't get it. They call Christians uneducated though they, the evolutionists, take Evolution as fact even when there has not been a single shred of real proof for .evolution. This book addresses the proofs for the Bible's accuracy. On its own it takes on all the fallacies of so-called scientific thinking. There is not a shred of proof for evolution and there is enormous proof for the accuracy of the Bible. This book covers that nicely."
2,Scientific Facts of the Bible,Not enough stratigy given as how to win over your opponent - I would like to see an expanded version of these subjects.
4,Very controversial reading,"This title could be more properly classified as a booklet, instead of a book. The author tries to show through examples why the Bible must be supernatural in origin. In thirteen chapters and 95 pages, Mr. Ray Comfort talks about science, book of Job, medical science, genesis, scientists, biology, accuracy of prophecies, astronomy, historical figures, archaeology, historical accuracy and evolution and their relation to the Bible. You need to read to take your own conclusions."
5,great book!,"i love this little book! it's small and handy and it's quick to read through. wasn't expecting it to be so small, but it was a great read!"
5,SCIENTIFIC FACTS IN THE BIBLE: 100 REASONS TO BELIEVE THE BIBLE,"GREAT BOOK! ISN'T ALL BASED ON THE KJV, HOWEVER, IT IS A GREAT BOOK THAT SHOWS THE BIBLE IS TRUE AND WE SHOULD BELIEVE GOD'S WORD AND LIVE BY IT! IMAGINE THAT!"
4,The Trouble with Angels,A gently used paperback edition. I am thrilled. This item brings back so many fond memories for me. I was tickled to be able to find it.
5,Another Winner!,"These guys have done it again! I've been a fan of these guys for years and when this disc came out I was amazed. The Best Yet! If you love industrial rock, these guys won't steer you wrong. This disc never leaves my CD player!"
5,The Everlasting Shame is Unashamed,I can proudly say that I own all of this bands CD's and The Everlasting Shame is a really great disc. I have never been dissappointed with any CD they have released so I'm not suprised that I love this one. My favorite song is Angels - I love that song. I cannot wait to see them live - please come to my town.
1,Keep Shopping,"The CD-ROM version of this dictionary is sorely done. The application looks like a program made for Windows 3.1 and does not even have the functionality of one. The dict. does not give a clue on where to hypenate words, which is the reason for buying it. The pronunciation guide uses Greek letters to make the sounds with no help on the Greek itself. The definitions are sparse, usually only a few words of description, and many have none at all. Most of the text is about the word root or history in latin, greek etc. This product is a big screw not worth 50 cents."
5,Best one volume dictionary around.,I bought this dictionary for all my nieces and nephews this year. It's soooooooooo much better than any junky Webster's Collegiate dictionary. You can actually find the words you don't recognize.
4,Too English,"A very good dictionary and CD-ROM. The International pronunciation guide is, however, incomprehesible and of no use. I couldn't get pronunciation from this dictionary. Another major shortcoming is that it does not provide hyphenation breads."
1,Music of the Police- Various Artists,"I would not give a star at all except the computer makes you. This albaum {is horrible} Let's just say I was embarrassed to have purchased it. I didn't even want to add it to the pile and threw it away, jewel case and all. Kept it for less than 5 hours. (The beginning track was okay but boring and the one interesting track was Roxanne.)-Original Police Fan"
2,2 1/2 stars notably better than average for the genre,"I was unsure where to place this book and finally decided on the erotic romance captured by aliens genre. It simply doesn't have the complexity of future action/erotic romance that ""Interstellar Service & Discipline: Victorious Star"" by Morgan Hawke has and is not close to Jaid Blacks ""The Empresses New Cloths"" while there is a little humor it falls short and the characters are OK but not as well developed as they could be and the plot is pretty rudi primly.Overall better than average for the erotic fantasy captured by aliens genre but not outstanding."
2,So not worth the money!,If could give 1star I would because this book was so boring plus it started real slow for me too. I had to force myself to finsh it without throwing the book away. This was my first time reading from this authur I have one more book from her and I pray that it is good.
3,"This bike is good, I guess.","I have had this bike for two years. It has held up well, I guess. The seat is beginning to fall apart. Also, the digital display no longer works correctly since the batteries began to leak a few months ago. I enjoy the magnetic tension adjustment, however it was not properly engineered. The wires running from the digital display unit to the tension motor are too close to an interior device which rotates when peddling. The friction has severed the wires and the unit malfunctioned. I was able to fix this with electrical tape. I don't know about this bike. I wouldn't recommend it. I think I'll just start doing pilates or something."
1,total waste of money,my bike worked at the beginning of last year but now it doesnt the bike started to stick and make grinding noises even tried oiling it as i got to using it and i would push through it and it would just aaaahhhh i could not use it anymore it just gets stuck and is a total waste of money do not buy
2,looks cool but doesnt help with heat issues,Your Xbox will look pretty cool setting in the glowing stand but it wont actually be any cooler. This stand only has two wimpy little fans that dont cool your xbox at all. For about the same price you can buy a standard house fan that will actually cool your xbox quite a bit. If you must buy a fan that is designed for xbox get nyko intercooler.
1,No Blow,Do not waste your money. Glow stand does not blow any air. I could barely feel any air when I placed my hands on top of both fans. I used a laser thermometer when measuring temperature and found that the console actually increased in temperature when using the glow stand. I have taken the components out of the glow stand and I am currently using it as a stand. $24.oo for a stand. Sucker. LOL.
2,Glow Stand with Fan,"Ok here it is:1. way to much noise.2. not enough air flow.3. 2 fans mounted on the bottom of unit and they were elavatedoff the bottom wich does not give good air flow, if mounted onon top plate just under xbox 360 would give way better air flow.4. to many vents on fanstand hamper the ability of the air flow tobe directed to the xbox. all in all not a good product for 360."
2,Loud noises,"This product works great considering when you place the xbox on it, I loud buzzing sounds goes off. However if you just let it make that noise for a while, it will stop and work great."
3,OK Overall,"It looks nice (it has a cool green glow when it's on), doesn't take up a lot of extra space, and does a pretty good job of cooling my XBOX 360. It has its own power supply, so it doesn't draw any extra power from your 360. It would be nice if it didn't have a rather large plug, however.With that being said, I'm not completely satisfied with it. After having this product for only a couple months of very limited use (due mainly to my extreme work schedule), it got VERY loud. The fans sound like they're ready to die. Have you ever heard a cooling fan in a computer power supply when it's about to quit working? It sounds like that x2 (due to this having 2 fans). I'm not sure I would recommend this product to anyone."
5,XBOX 360 GLOW STAND WITH FAN,"I love this fan better than my old one I had. The old one created a lot dust that was clogging my Xbox. This one doesn't do that plus, it has that cool light! It was well worth the money for it!"
4,descent fan,"This fan is nice because it has it's own power source. However, after using it a while, when I start it up it makes a noise like the fans are scraping against the insides. However, it goes away in less than a minute."
1,Broken,Product broke after less than 2 months of use. Only used VERY occassionally. Very dissastified with product. I DO NOT recommend this.
2,regular,"No da nada de aire, son unos ventiladores de 12V que muy apenas dan una brisa.PRO: El diseño y tamañoCON: No da aire (para eso se supone que es)"
1,Don't Be Fooled By The Silly Lights,"This light fan was a waste of money I hadn't had problems with humming or irregular sound, but I did when I used this awful product. Don't be fooled with the number of positive reviews, because they are only talking about the light and nowhere on the back of the package does it really say that it cools the system. It reads, ""This green fan light looks cool"" not that it really does anything.Don't buy this product!"
2,Bzzzz glow stand.,"The glow stand does cool my xbox 360 nicely but it also has this horrible something in the fan noise on start. In my opinion it works, but may have to be replaced due to the fan noise. My fiance says its my stupid xmonument due to ultra cool green LEDs."
2,NOT A SOLUTION TO THE FREEZE PROBLEM!!!!!!,"My xbox 360 freezes every once in a while. This fan decreases the amount of times the screen freezes. However, it surely is not a solution to the freeze problem."
3,"Useful, but not solve the problem!!!","This item looks nice, but is not the solution for the heat issue of the X360. Work like an accesory more than a cooler ad-on. The fans are not very powerful, may be need a extra fan or need a more powerful equipment to diminish the inside hell of X360.My 360 it continues overheating, although it's working fine."
5,works and looks great,"excelent product, too bad xbox cant be as reliable. i got this fan after i got the xbox ring of death. the box runs cooler and better now."
3,"Glows -N- Shines, but Lacks Perfection!","This Glow stand really glows and looks amazing, but the problem is that sometimes the lights flickers a lot! I was disappointed at this, but there's anything I can do about it... It keeps your Xbox glowing and cool, but the flicker annoys. If you really need this flicker stand buy it if not save your money and buy a cool game!"
3,"Works, But some Problems...","My 360 is noticeably cooler with this fan, and nothing has melted as a result.That being said, the fans tends to start up with a loud grinding that is not natural. I have to remove my 360 from the unit and shake/turn/reset it to get it to stop, which so far it has every time.In addition, the only way to turn it on or off is from the back of the unit. The switch is small, so if your 360 is going to be on a tight entertainment center (why else did you need extra circulation?) you will get frustrated having to reach around and feel for the switch to turn it on.Other than those quibbles, a good buy compared to what I've seen online from other fans."
2,"Poor design or defective unit, take your pick","I recently purchased one the these ""coolers"" to help and save my xbox 360 from a trip in the coffin to Texas. However, I believe this item sent my xbox in overdrive straight to the repair shop. The lights on the unit flickered constantly and it proved to show no improvement to the heating issues associated with my 360. I thought that there might be something wrong with my cooler and since it has a lifetime warranty I tried to get in contact with company. No telephone number is present on the packaging so you have to deal with them through the internet. Oh well, I guess I'll just start from scratch with a all new."
1,Not Cool,"I ordered the Glow Stand w/fans as a cooling device for my Xbox 360. It's a really nice stand, with memory card holders, and real neat lighting. However, if your looking for a cooling device you HAVE to look elsewhere. I don't have technical measuring tools but I can tell you that the fans would NOT hold a post'it note to my hand at two inches. The two small fans (appox two inches square each, 12 volt, 11 fan blades each) don't move much air and with very little speed.More technical: The included plugin mini power-pack is 9 volt, like a cell phone charger. I did try running the 12 volt rated fans at 12 volts, still not much air flow. Power supply or case fans are two thick to fit in as replacement fans, so don't think you can easily mod it that way. If you just want a stand or like the lights then it's OK.One star rating is my rating as a cooling device, given only because zero stars is not an available option."
3,NOT TERRIBLE.......,i got this a few months ago but i am not too impressed. it does the job but it struggles with noise. its mainly just the way it was built. much better than the intercooler by far but the two fan wheels kinda rattle sometimes and i find it annoying but otherwise ok
4,Highly Recommended... Some Tinkering Required,"This glow stand cooler has been a really great buy for me. It doesn't hog power from the 360 and runs really well. The only downside is that mine, along with many others it seems, runs rather loud like the fan is rubbing up against its insides for the first 2 to 3 minutes it's on... usually a light tap can fix this... but I try to just wait it out being that my semi-expensive 360 is sitting on top of it. So if you have just enough nerve to deal with a small annoyance for a great cooling system... buy this one... don't get the Intercooler... it will fry your system and void your warranty."
3,it does the trick,"well so far i have noticed my system isnt that hot, i got this for my husband who loves to relax with some video games and his friends, i figured the price was great and what could it hurt...its been great so far, its only been 30 days but, met the expectations"
3,Great Product?,"The xbox 360 glow stand with fan is a great product if your looking for something to keep your 360 cool without the risk of burning it out(like other products)because it draws its power from a seperate ac adapter thats included(which is a plus). The only problems i have are its noisy(imagine the fan sound from your 360x2) and it takes some of the wireless fun out of the 360. Its great that you can turn on your 360 with the remote(so you don't have to get off your couch or out of your bed) but it begins to be quite a hassle when you have to get up to turn your Xbox 360 Glow Stand with Fan on and off(remotes anyone).Also the glowing lights are worthless (plus they don't match the color of the 360) and they should've been replace with something that actually serves a purpose like controller cradles. In closing the Xbox 360 Glow Stand with Fan is great at what it does (cooling) especially when compared to other products, but there's always room for improvement."
2,POWERFUL FANS BUT CHEAP BUILD,"This stand was working great for about two weeks. The fans were strong bringing in lots of cool air. Then I noticed a noise coming from the stand. It started out as a low pitch humming which progressed daily to a loud humming with vibration. I think it is the metal in the bottom screen just below the fans but I am not sure. Well anyway, I replaced the stand with the one from Gameshark which I had bought before the Glow Stand. Should have never replaced it to begin with."
1,Xbox 360 Glow Stand with Fan,"This actually adds to the heat problem, it does not allow the heat to ""Dissipate""."
1,DO NOT BUY,this thing ruined my xbox 360! it just pumped it full of dust cause it is right off the the stand that it is on. NOW my xbox is broken and i had to get it repaired!
4,"Works good, fans kinda loud at times","Works good, fans kinda loud at times. Works like it should. I really liek the green glow, nad it reminds me that it;s on. The downfalls are that the switch is annoyingly at the back of the unit and that the fans can be loud. Give it a smack on the side and the fans quiet back up...only happens sometimes, other times it's fine."
3,Not so cool cooler,"This cooling station really does not move a lot of air in the stock configuration. The dust grilles have holes that are so small, It could clog very fast if used in a dusty environment. I removed the grilles and widened the holes in the plastic where the fans are. Airflow was acceptable, but still not a lot. I replaced the fans with ones that have double the cubic feet per min. airflow. I also discarded the power supply that came with the unit. The fans are 12 volts, the power supply is 9 volts. I had a 12 volt wall wart supply, so I used it instead.works great now.If the unit had come with a 12v supply, I might not have had to ""butcher"" a very nice cooling stand. As it comes from the manufacturer, it's not very usable as a cooling device."
2,Could be So much better!,"- Fans are REALLY WEAK- Restricted Airflow+ The Base fits the 360 Well, So I actually Cut out the bottom of the cooling station, found an old wire napkin holder and mounted a Scythe Slip Stream Kaze Maru2 140 underneath it. Used a Radio Shack 12v power adapter to power the fan. And what can I say? That fan puts out around 93CFM. Super cooled 360...So If you want to MOD the base unit with more powerfull fans or something its a good fit..."
4,"Better than Vulture Street, but not Odyssey #5","I was worried that Vulture Street, although good, was the beginning of Powderfinger's fall from their peak, Odyssey #5 (this is obviously just my opinion). Dream Days seems to be better than Vulture Street after a few listens. IMO its not better than Odyssey or Internationalist. But a very strong album indeed. Not a bad track on the album."
4,I really like this guy,"I was taken with Bernard Fanning's voice. Particularly on ""Tea & Symphony."" So my wife bought me this PF CD for my birthday. Having listened to it 4 times now, I must say, it really grows on you. Again, it's his voice. The band has it's moments too but the melodies are quite nice and the songs are packed with emotions which is good for us helpless romantics. I haven't heard their earlier CD's. They seem a bit more hard rock when listening to short clips on Amazon. I especially give praise when the whole family likes it, including the kids! Fanning is an advocate for humanitarian causes and human rights. Another reason to support him and his music."

3,an ardent fan of Paul Cadmus's work,"My sole reason for acquiring this book was to learn more of the very private-seeming artist Paul Cadmus and to uderstand how he and Lincoln Kirstein came to be inlaws. As a result of the focus on George Platt Lynes, I will pursue more of his work as well. This narrative/history clarifies the various Cadmus paintings featuring Platt Lynes, Monroe Wheeler, and Glenway Westcott plus additional models. Personally, their sexual orientation is of no interest to me. Their art and contributions to art are indisputable. I enjoyed Mr. Leddick's presentation, which was fun and breezy. I look forward to locating Platt Lynes exhibitions and hope to view original Cadmus paintings before long. As for Jared French, imagine my surprise to discover a painting of his at the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, NY. Not once was there a single mention that any of these gentlemen might be fans of baseball, but you just never know, do you."
1,[weak],"This is an abyssally written, horribly researched, inaccurate, unorganized babble of idle gossip about some truly great artists and writers. The author should not attempt to write about things beyond his limited ken. What a travesty that a publisher would agree to print such garbage!"
2,I've stepped in deeper puddles,"As shallow look at some shallow men, specialy Platt Lynes. Only Paul Cadmus seems to have some reedeming qualities, and he is portrayed as undersexed and remote. I am glad I did not know any of these men."
5,Whitaker writes who he is.,"Jack Whitaker spins stories not only about exotic people and places; he also reveals a great deal about himself. His content and style clearly communicate a man who deeply appreciates the important things in life, a perspective that allows him to keep his long professional career, with its legion chance-of-a lifetime experiences, in perspective. Whitaker's book is a testimony to gratitude, not ego. ""Preferred Lies and Other Tales"" is, ultimately, stories less about sports, and more about life. In a culture flooded with hype, Jack Whitaker is a voice of hope."
1,Sophomoric and Uninspired,"Jeff Goodell's book about his family and life suffers from having boring and mundane subject matter. His domestic problems are summed up in divorced parents and dysfunctional siblings that are wholly uninteresting and generally unsympathetic. His love for his brother is forced into the book to make the narrator more sympathetic and thus more central to the plot. Finally, the prose is as boring as the story as it is both unimaginative and all too simplistic. Just because Goodell had a life it does not warrant him to write about it."
2,A bit disappointed,"Having fallen in love with The Silver Tree, this was my 2nd purchase of Lisa Gerrards. This album lost that familiar feel I had treasured in the Silver Tree and seemed simply to try to sample each and every musical culture...losing its focus.That being said...I respect the artist tremendously and recognize I may be missing something...as I'm a new fan and don't know her other works in depth."
2,Disappointing,"My first exposure to Lisa Gerrard was through the ""Gladiator"" sound track, where she collaborated with Han Zimmer and other artists. She's a better collaborator than a solo artist. The quality of tracks is poor and repetitive. Stick to ""Gladiator""."
5,quiet and effective trimmer,"I too bought mine on advice of an airline best-of rating about 8 years ago. It still works great, and is easy to keep clean. The unit was made in Japan (spit and polish) quality."
5,received on time and as specified,Received Polar original product as specified. I bought it to replace my old one which was breaking due to its age and amount of use. Everything was received within the specified time to ship. No complaints.
4,Works great and cost effective!,"I am impressed with this booster! Washes the windwhield of light sap, and bird droppings and does a much better job on bugs than the blue juice. Although it does not work below freezing unless it is mixed with a low temp washer fluid."
5,Flashback!,I lived through a similar event.It was chillingly familar. The suspense had me on the edge of my chair. I was fascinated with the description of old friends meeting under compelling circumstances to piece together an event from their collective past behind convent walls. Bravo for breaking the conspiracy of silence!
1,"Don't Be Fooled, This Isn't a Deal!","Buy seasons 1-5 and season 6 (pt.1) seperately...it's cheaper than this supposed deal. Do the math for yourselves. Better yet, take the time to see if buying each season seperately isn't even cheaper.Come on, Amazon.ca, we're smarter than that!"
1,Not worth it,"My fiancee and I found this to be ineffective on either of our faces at removing either oil or blackheads. Nice construction and easy operation, but unfortunately it just didn't work as advertised...went right back to the store."
4,"Works great, but don't expect to buy a miracle either.","I tried several different ones and this one is by far the best. You need to read the directions and keep you face damp like it says. It cleans you pores, but you need to use regularly for awhile to see results. Also it's not an extractor, for that your better off getting a metal extractor (revlons it's not too hot, but tweezerman makes a good one for about $10-$12)"
2,was not helpful,"this was not helpful for me or my bf.I just noticed that negative reviews on this item are rated as unhelpful by most: please do not delude yourself. This product does not work for people with moderate acne, at all. A scrub or any cream suppressing the developement of acne would do much better. Unless u want to use this product for non-prescribed purposes"
4,Not a miracle product but its good,"I wouldnt say it is a miracle product but it is really good. The machine is simple to use and clean. you can clean the cap by q-tips even. It can cause purple spots after using but it goes away quickly. I would say to use it like before you go to bed not before going out, your nose or face can be red for awhile. It does suck out black spots and oil and you can see it doing it. not all of it at once it takes patience for your face and skin to adjust. Warm water and scrubs help before you use it. It is just better than squeezing it out and or using stripes. It is painless and effective. I would suggest that you use it if you dont have extreme dry skin. Again dont expect miracles."
1,Overrated,"Unless your face oil is naturally oozing without you doing anything (that is if you are beyond redemption)MAYBE you'll see some dirt sucked up by this machine. Also be careful about the purple spots. Frankly speaking you can see better results if you just use traditional methods (yeah, go infront of a mirror and squeeze)I would keep my money, buy other hand held black spot extracting instruments, (such as the one your dermatalogist is using, a 4-5 inch thin metal stick with a tiny metal loop attached at the end) which would cost at most 4-5 bucks and give that a try first.I bought this for my sister and my mom also tried it they are both extremely dissatisfied. I do the nose squeezing now and then, and I tried this too, only once, thinking that this may be a more scientific approach. Nah!Listen to me, use a soda straw and keep your money."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this after reading all the reviews and with expectation that it'll work by using it with patience, but it didn't work at all. I use it for 3 weeks on a regular basis and now it's stored in my basement. Don't bother to try it. It doesn't work."
1,this product sucks....and I don't mean literally,"I used it...and used it and used it....just like everyone said that I should do to give it a chance. Well it was gathering dust in my bathroom and now it just missed the donation pile today. The reason that it missed the donation pile was because I threw the box away and I didn't want someone to wonder ""what in the heck is this thing...and what did that lady do with it??"" So it will continue to gather dust....tucked away in my drawer. DON""T BUY IT. Get some apricot scrub instead."
1,Don't bother,I bought this item with high hopes but it is pretty much useless. My teenage daughter wasn't happy with it either.
1,Upset,I used it for the first time this morning as I am leaving for a vacation and thought it'll make me look good in my vacation. Guess what? It left all pink/purple marks in my face and I look like a clown now. I can't pose for the photos in the vacation now. I am so upset. I didn't use it for a long time at one spot. I think my skin is very sensitive. But for the money I paid I didn't expect it. It ruined my vacation. I don't know when these spots will go away.
2,"Worked for me, but. . . .","Pulled gunk out of my pores, but also broke capilliaries. If you are at all prone to spider veins and broken capilliaries on your face, avoid this product."
2,Not great,"This product seems like it might be OK for loosely clogged pores, but for deeper blackheads, or for large pores, it doesn't work at all. I have drier skin, so maybe that's the problem, but we tried it on my boyfriend and absolutely nothing budged. I have tried it about 6 times over the last two weeks, and the only time anything was ever extracted from my pores was right where my nose meets my cheek, and I was excited to see some gunk actually get sucked out. However, the next day, that area was completely bruised and dark red with blood under the skin. Another effort yielded two circular bruises - one on my nose and another on my chin. So while I believe this might work for some people, I'm not sure it won't damage your skin. I'm unfortunately sending mine back since it causes bruising, which doesn't seem appropriate for this type of appliance."
1,Useless,"Absolutely no visible results after three weeks of regular use. I never felt like I was clearing anything out of my pores. Fortunately, I was able to return it for a refund."
2,Stops working after one year,"The product somehow works, but you have to have an incredible patience to do anything. Since it takes so long to use, I barely have used it over the last year that I have purchased it. Also, I just found out yesterday that the thing does not want to work any more. How convenient, after the warranty is expired, the thing stops working, even though I was using it properly and only occasionally.I do not recommend this product"
5,Very Satisfying,"I think this pore cleanser has really improved my complexion. I use it almost every morning after the shower and am always amazed at the gunk that is pulled out each time! It's satisfying in a slightly gross way, but I like seeing results! I highly recommend it."
2,no benefits to those who already exfoliate and deep-clean,"Okay... I read all the reviews before purchasing this item ~1.5 months ago. I tried using it on many occasions. It is easy to use. It did not leave bruises on my skin. But it also didn't suck much oil out of my pores either. And you want to know why? Because I'm already using micro-abrasive facial cleansers as well as exfoliation-enhancing salicyclic acid treatments. So maybe this product works for those who do not already spend a lot of time and effort deep-cleaning their face. But for people already following a rigorous cleansing protocol, this product does not do a thing."
1,It's not worth it,"When I read the other recommendatios I was convinced that this shaver could help me with my irritable skin, but quite the contrary, it made my problem worst, and the quality of the product is very low, it started malfunctioning scince the begining, until a few months later it stop working.Do yourself a favor and try another shaver."
5,A great beginning Wonders of the World DVD set,"My 4th- 6th grade gifted students have enjoyed ""travelling"" the world with this series. The 2 disks have both man-made and natural world wonders. Disk 2 also has a PowerPoint type of section with appropriate music from that world location in the background. It gives a bit of cultural flavor to the scenery. I will be playing this as a loop during my in-school Wonders of the World museum."
5,As good as it gets.,"First let me say that polishing a car is what makes the car shine, not wax. It's a lot more important. And so the polish you choose is critical and should be done with care.I tried P21S Polish years ago, and continued my quest for the perfect polish by trying other products. My garage now has a lot of polishes from Klasse to Maguiar's to Pinnacle to Poorboys - and I've come back to P21S. It's easy to apply and remove, and leaves a very nice sheen to my car. I honestly have not found a polish that cleans and illuminates a finish better than P21S does. Buy it."
1,worthless,"same as the last pine book I bought, has old stuff that no one even likes anymore, needed fresh ideas."
1,big let down..,very disappointed with this product. the trimmings go everywhere and all over the trimmer itself..it's not very close at all..definitely leaves something to be desired..
3,Just another shaver,I bought this product so I didn't have to use a razor on my bikini area. Well I still do. I have used it once and it didn't get any closer then my other electric shaver from Norelco. This product is fine if you just wanted to trim down the bikini area but not if you want it smooth for swim suit season.
1,"Surprised Panasonic item, Sold by Amazon failed to work","I bought this for my wife overseas and unfortunately she was not able to use it before the return policy expired. The product was used once and then stopped working all together. I called Amazon upon my return to the U.S. but they simply informed me that the return date has expired and to contact Panasonic.I love purchasing from Amazon.com especially products sold by Amazon LLC, but this was disappointing to hear that they could not help me out after I had purchased so many products through their website.Usually electronic products have a given one year warranty, but theses are simply 30 days. For every 100 of these trimmers probably 1-5 are faulty. Just my luck of the draw I guess.I purchased this because the reviews were great for it, and it probably is a great trimmer. I just won't be able to give you much advise as mine didn't even work."
2,"Worked, then died.","I bought this for my wife because she complained of using a razor. 6 months later the thing just decides to stop working for no apparent reason. I'm not going to even bother complaining, just buy a Norelco or something."
3,Not what I thought but works ok,"This is much smaller than I thought so not true to size as pictured. It does work if you have a lot of hair to remove, otherwise, not so much. Kinda disappointed with this but it did work."
4,trimmer,I loved this product. It runs with battery so cordless. It is not very powerful but it does the job without a mess. Highly recommend it.
3,Good trimmer but doesn't cut close,PROS: This is a pretty good trimmer. It's easy to clean and makes it almost impossible to create nicks and cuts.CONS:It can be a bit unwieldy and doesn't give a close shave but it'll do.
4,Good little trimmer,"Works perfectly. Doesn't cause any irritation, works quickly, easily adjusted, good handheld shape. My only complaint is that the guard seems a little flimsy (it's plastic), and that it may break down the road. I've only had the trimmer for a month, though, so I'll update if anything untoward occurs."
5,Great little trimmer!,"After having looked for years to something like this, I bought it to dity up and it is absolutely fab!! Does a great job!"
2,Not very gentle,I expected a razor for the bikini area to be close but gentle. This razor pinches! I would not buy it again.
4,It trims,Its compact and works well in tight spaces. I wish it were waterproof though.... that would make clean up easier.
4,Good Value,"Perfect bikini area trimmer, especially for the price. If that's what you need, buy this product! I agree with the other reviewers that the guard isn't necessary."
3,not that fast,It takes some time to get the job done with this product. I am not 100% satisfied because it doesn't do the job neatly. As if not sharp or fast enough.
4,I don't really have anything to compare it to,"I've never owned a product like this before, so I can't really provide a good review here without something to compare it to. I have used this product once and it wasn't as clean and snappy of a job as I thought it would be, but maybe I set my expectations too high. It did what it is supposed to do and the product seems to be quality, so no complaints. :)"
3,"Works well, seems a bit pricey","This bikini trimmer works well. My only issue with it is that, if you also epilate, you might as well save the money and buy the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Body System Epilator:Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Body System EpilatorThis has a bikini trimmer attachment that can trim the hair down south.If you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice. However, if you just need to trim down, and also epilate, the Braun product does a decent job of just trimming it down---the price of it is a little over double of the trimmer, but therefore works well as a combination product for a couple different needs."
1,Over heats,"I was very excited for this new trimmer but it over heats after about 30 seconds, so you constantly have to turn it off and on so it doesn't burn your skin. Plus its too big to curve to your body."
2,Only a year later and it's dead,"It worked as expected for the 1 year I have had it, but now it is completely dead. I can't get it to work at all. I know it was only $20 but I hoped it would've lasted longer."
4,Works well,"It won't make you as smooth as a bikini wax, or a shave,but you won't have to worry about ingrown hairs orrazor bumps. A very safe way to trim a sensitive area."
5,Really good for what is intended for.,"If you are trying to cut a very tall grass, you have to go step by step so you don't bug out the lawn mower ,until is very low. The same thing with this, use the trimmer's position down to 1 and then disconnect the plastic guide and you can go lower, always using the same angle of attack as designed , and then after that you could shave with an electric shaver. It takes just a few minutes , depending how big the game field is. Good luck."
4,"Great product, just wish it went a little shorter","This trimmer works beautifully. It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain. I also use it on my arms, which reduces the appearance of the hair without giving that weird hairless shaven arm look. My only complaint is that the shortest setting is .125 inches, which is still a considerable amount of hair. Sometimes I remove the ""safety"" head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch. I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong."
4,Best Bikini Trimmer I've Tried,"This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely. If you are anti apilator and waxing, this trimmer is worth the purchase."
4,"Great product, deceiving picture","This trimmer is great. I got it after reading all the other reviews and I have to agree with everyone about how good a trimmmer it is. The only disappointment I have is I expected a carrying case for the trimmer, like on the picture, but it did not have one included."
3,Love This Trimmer,Originally I rated this trimmer only 3 stars because I didn't think it trimmed the hair close enough. But then I discovered if you remove the grooming comb you get a nice clean trim. I highly recommend this now.
4,"Good trimmer, cleaning not simple",It's a good trimmer and I like it. Only pain point is too many small parts to clean and doesn't seem like you can run it under a tap. Must be cleaned with the small brush and the hair gets in tiny grooves.
5,"Easy, safe and effective!","Love this product! The fact that it trims evenly makes you look a lot neater. It's very very safe, so you can use close to the very private areas."
2,"It's ok, definitely not the best, even for the price.","I bought this trimmer to replace 1 I left behind on vacation. I don't find it as efficient as my old trimmer (which unfortunately doesn't seem to be in production anymore.) So, it's an effective trimmer, but you will have to make several passes over the same area. Perhaps the blades aren't as sharp as on my old trimmer. There is one HUGE CON - this trimmer drains rechargeable nimh batteries, even when it is not being used. As proof, I put a pair of fully charged batteries in the trimmer when it arrived. I used it once, and the battery power was fine. I tried to use it again a week or so later, and the batteries were completely drained. Apparently this trimmer draws energy from the batteries even while it isn't operating. My old 1 did not have this problem."
2,Ehh...,"I like that it's compact and cordless, but the guide's edge is too rounded off so it doesn't catch the hair as easily and the shortest length (imo) isn't short enough. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone and stick to trimmers from Wahl."
1,Worked for just one time,Such a waste. It only worked once before it died. Was supposed to be good for the shower but I think that is what killed it.
4,Works good but I wish the on & off indicator was clear.,"First thought my trimmer wasn't working when I first put batteries in because it was already on the on switch. There are no words saying on or off & the symbols used to indicate so are not universal in meaning so I had no idea it was already on the ""on"" setting. My batteries weren't pushed down far enough. *Battery casing is a bit loose, so batteries are sort of misaligned when you put them in. *I thought the blades would've been a bit sharper. For closer shave take blade protector off. Works better for coarse kinky hair (4c hair)."
1,Not worth the money,"Had the shaver 12 months, and it just stopped working. Never got it wet and cleaned if after each use. Barely used--So upset."
1,Broke after a few uses,"At first I thought this was a decent and affordable trimmer. That is until is stopped working less than 6 months after I got it. I tried changing the batteries and cleaning it, but it won't turn on. I would not recommend this product."
5,No razor burn or bumps!,"I just got this little trimmer and it's awesome! It won't get you completely smooth, but it will go as close as possible without any damage to your skin. Very nice and easy to use."
5,Great Trimmer,"This is a trimmer, not a shaver. But is does trim close enough to give you a good alternative rather than shaving or waxing. It is quite, trims well with no pulling or irritation, and is easy to clean."
2,Not Good,"only use this if you have nothing else. you have to pass over areas repeatedly to get an even trim. even on the lowest guard height. removing the guard results in hair being entirely too low, almost gone. i do not like."
2,Stopped working!,"Got to use it about 3x and it stopped working! Thought it just ran out of bat so i changed it but nothing happened. Not worth the $20! Buy yourself a Quattro bikini trimmer instead, only $10 and lasted me 2 years!"
4,Simple to use and works.,"I like this trimmer. It took a bit to get used to but it works well. It is easy to clean, but you do have to clean it every time and it is a little annoying to do even though it is easy. Simple to use and it works."
1,awful,advertised on Dr. Oz show and I bought 4 to include my sisters;these things don't trim hair at all!junk
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"I bought this product based on the good reviews. However, it just died after only 3 months of infrequent use. I changed the batteries and it didn't work, it's dead. What a waste of money. It also didn't trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn't get those awful red bumps afterwards. But the attachment doesn't even work, I had to take it off whenever I used it as otherwise it didn't get any hairs, and then it would just scratch my skin while it shaved. Avoid!"
1,Worst Trimmer!!!,"I read the reviews carefully before purchasing this trimmer. I really wanted to like it, however the product is worthless. I bought this because my original one broke after years of use. My origninal trimmer was made for men and I thought to try a product made for women. That was a mistake, it barely trims and is made cheaply. I regret this purchase...."
2,This is a toy.,"This is a toy for kids who want to practice trimming their pubes. A grown person with actual pubes, however, will be better off using duct tape. You basically have to pre-trim before using this vibrator thing to tidy up. Using it as the primary tool will feel like having a toothy hamster go to town on your business. OUCH!!!Pros: Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape.Cons: Able to replicate the hair removing action of much more expensive duct tape."
2,"Too weak, too small (I'm a man)","I used this to groom my genitals, and this thing could barely cut anything. It took many passes over the same area to do anything. This thing might be ok for trimming a few strands of hair but not a hairy man."
5,Great Personal Shaver,"Great personal shaver. It does not remove all the hair, like a razor, but it get pretty close. No nicks. Easy to clean. I use it in the shower but I make sure I don't get it wet.****January 2013****The Panasonic shaver died. Good little shaver and I guess 2 years is a pretty good run nowadays. I'm afraid nothing last too long these days, but what did I expect for $20?"
5,Satisfied customer,"THank YOu! I had been wanting something like this forever, I thought it only existed in my dreams!!!!!"
2,Broke before I could use it,"I wish I could tell you how wonderful this product is, especially since Dr. Oz himself recommended the thing on a show. Problem is that the thing fell apart as I was trying to get it out of the packaging. I was too frustrated to even bother contacting the company for a replacement."
4,It does the job.,"It does the job with ease. I experienced no pulls, nicks, or ingrown hairs. It cuts just close enough and all at a good price."
4,Excellent during the 18 months it worked,"I purchased this in January 2011 and it worked until the summer of 2012 with 1 - 2x a month usage. I am considering buying it again because I can't seem to find anything else like it. I may opt for the Always Bikini Perfect since it can be used in the shower (even though it doesn't have as favorable reviews). I used it without the cover the whole time and you have to be careful. I wish it were a little narrower, like the ones sold in the drugstore (I think Venus has one -- but this one does not last more than a month). So overall I would recommend this trimmer but I wish it lasted a little longer than a year and a half."
4,works well but kinda bulky,"Purchased this trimmer as an easy way to shape and trim the tough areas. The trimmer is a little bulky and not the easiest to maneuver but does a pretty good job. If you are looking for a trimmer that can cut down to the skin or make designs, this is not the trimmer for you; without the guard, it leaves a little less than 1/8 inch. It is also not a trimmer you can bring in the shower with you, not a waterproof shaver. It is a definite step up from shaving with a razor however and works well so far."
5,Every Girl Needs one!,"After reading some of the other reviews, I almost didn't buy this. But boy am I glad I did! It's inexpensive. It's cut my shaving time by two thirds! It's so easy. No bumps, and it's all even. Fabulous. Every girl needs this product!"
1,Don't buy,I have had this combo unit for about 6 months. It worked fine for a while then whamo. The DVD player heats up about half way through a movie and the picture freezes and will not play. The door on the DVD side has fallen off (not due to any rough treatment). The VCR makes funny noises when playing a tape. The remote control is not a universal remote so I had to add one more remote to my collection. I'am very unhappy with this unit.
2,doesn't do all it says it does,"i picked this up with the specific purpose of playing jpeg, mp3 CD's and DVD's that I burned. I couldn't get it to work - so I finally read the instruction manual and there is NO mention that it does anything but the standard commerical audio CD and movie DVD.On page 4, it states clearly that it ONLY plays audio CD's (no mp3 or jpeg). The rest of the page is a warning that it's got copyright protection, over and over.In all honesty, I have not been to the website to see if there's a firware update, etc. that would alter this and I haven't done any searches to see if there's something available that would alter this - yet.I've had no problems using the DVD or Vhs as a normal DVD/VHS player and Vhs recorder. It just doesn't do anything else and I bought it (at the time, also paying more) because I wanted the other features."
4,So far so good,"I'm very skeptical when it comes to DVD players...all the companies are getting sued for putting knowingly defective models on the market. So I hesistated in buying any type of DVD player until now. So with much hesitation and trepidation, I plunked down the $120 plus $40 for ESP at Circuit City. I have yet to use the DVD player. But my son uses the VCR a lot. I noticed right off the bat that the VCR makes a humming/grating noise. I thought it was the tape so I tried various different titles and they all do it.Anyone else have a noisy VCR deck?? If not, maybe I just got a buggy one and should swap it."
3,The first review has it dead on...,"...except for a third little gripe. All of Samsung's literature says that it has an optical digital audio output, and the back is labelled for it, but the panel where it should be is blank. I replaced a defective V3650 with this V4600 and I couldn't believe that they would say it has something, then not actually have it. The V3650 is much better, in my opinion...However, the combo DVD/VCR concept is an excellent one and I am still pleased with this product. It saves valuable space in my stereo cabinet which has now ballooned to 6 components and a maze full of wires."
3,"Lots of Style, a couple Problems","There are only two real negatives that I've discovered. But both are really annoying.First, the output from the unit for both VHS and DVD is only via composite LINE OUT. This means you need to switch your TV's input each time you change from watching a tape or DVD to watching tv. Older models had dual outputs where you could hook up a coax line to the tv as well as composites to the Video input and both would be driven, so there would be no need to switch unless you really wanted the slightly higher video quality from the composite line.Second, there's no indicator light when you've programmed the VCR to tape on a timer. What's up with that?Otherwise great value for the cost; and quite an attractive package. Tech support from Samsung was very very good when I called for a quick answer to a complex question."
2,DVD poor quality,"We use this unit in our family room. It has a confusing interface/menu system. DVD Player skips and/or freezes quite frequently. My daughter received a new DVD on her birthday.It will not go past the ""play menu"" screen. When selecting ""play movie"", it loops back to the selection screen. This DVD plays fine on the other two DVD players we own. We have contacted Customer Service and will ship it back soon. Customer Service Rep was courteous and helpful. Based on other reviews I won't get my hopes up.We did return to Service Center (on our dime). Item was repaired and shipped back. Seems to work now.Fingers Crossed :)"
1,Horrible Quality,"Like others have previously posted on here, my DVD unit stopped working after about a year of use. The player freezes and won't even load the disks. I tried cleaning the lens and a few other tricks to try to get it to work, but it needs serious repair. If I can't get it covered under warranty, I'm not going to bother. Don't buy this unit!!!"
2,Samsung should stick to cell phones!!!,"I bought this unit in February 2005 and it is now November 2005 and it takes FOREVER to load the DVD, also at first I thought that it was my DVD but I noticed that during movies the thing just freezes at times, it runs like a slow computer. Don't waste your money on this, next time I will spend the 10 extra bucks for something that actually works."
1,Don't buy it...,"This DVD/VCR combo is crap. The VCR plays tapes fine although it rewinds and fast-forwards very slowly. The DVD player plays DVDs and CDs perfectly well, but that's it. It doesn't play any of the other formats that it claims it can play. I've tried DVD-R, DVD+R, VCD (.avi, .mpeg), CD-R/RW, and MP3 CDs (it will load the MP3 CD but won't play it) and every single time it says, ""This disc cannot be played."" I bought an APEX DVD player for half the cost of this worthless contraption (only $60) and it plays all of these formats great."
1,Samsung DVD-4600 DVD/VCR Combo,"I had purchase the Samsung DVD/VCR Combo for my wife for X-mas. She loves taking pictures with her digital camera. The DVD plays JEG pictures. I set up the DVD/VCR combo. The DVD worked perfect. The VCR would play but the tracking was very bad. I couldn't correct it with the tracking controls. The VCR ate my tape, I could not get the tape out. I had to stand in long return lines at our Best BUY electronics store to return it. The 16 year old employee informs me I should purchase the 3 year warranty after what happen to the last DVD/VCR Player. I said NO! There are to many quality products at Amazon.com. I took my money and ordered online............"
1,Poor Audio,"I bought the unit today, I'm bringing it back tomorrow. The DVD video playback isn't bad, but the VCR video and sound is terrible. To me this unit sounds like everything played back is in MONO. Even when just listening to TV through it's receiver. Also, the video tracking isn't that great on pre-recorded tapes and there is some audio noise on playback of tapes and DVD's. I'm going to look at the JVC unit."
1,Two of them lasted less than six months,I've owned two of these contraptions. The first one lasted less than a week and the second one lasted about six months. Never again will I buy a Samsung DVD or VCR. Definitely don't waste your money on this one.
1,Poor quality and almost non-existant support from Samsung,"I actually have an earlier model Samsung DVD player, and it, along with other Samsung models at the time, had a horrible skipping problem on many DVDs. Samsung's support was almost non-existant -- I found out there was a firmware upgrade for the player, but not through their website (where I couldn't find any help whatsoever), but through a friend with the same problem. HOWEVER, the firmware upgrade did not resolve the problem, and the last I heard, there was a class action suit filed here in Pennsylvania (which I received an invitiation to be a part of, but could not participate in, I think because I no longer had the receipt). Considering their lackluster customer support, I would advise anyone against buying any DVD player from this company. Players are much cheaper nowadays anyway, and you can get an excellent Sony or Toshiba for a modest price."
4,I have had mine 2 years now...,"I don't know why the other reviewers have had so many problems!Mine has worked FLAWLESSLY for 2 years now.Lately, the dvd player has been acting up. Maybe it's time for a replacement. Been looking for the same model."
3,dvd player did not work for most of my dvds,"I received this DVD player as a gift in around the year of 2007 and the VCR worked well. Most of the dvds did work well on this unit as well at that time. I use to watch church services that my dad burned on a dvds but I could not anymore after sometime in the year of 2010. I noticed that this dvd player did not work with other type of dvds anymore such as the dvds that I buy outside of the US. In 2012, the dvd player door did not fully open up unless I hold the top flap up. I had to revert to playing most of my dvds on my playstation 2 system. The only dvds that this player works on now are like the American Blockbuster type of dvds."
5,Great player!,Have had zero problems with the player. No weird noises or vibrations as others have noted. Plays DVDs and CDs beautifully.
2,Piece of junk!,"I've had this Samsung VCR/DVD combo since about 2006. In about 1 year after owning the device I noticed that several DVDs couldn't be played on the machine. These were the newer DVDs that I ordered from Netflix. However these could be played on a DVD player that was nearly 10yrs old with no problem! Just after yesterday, my unit completely broke down. The VCR had recorded something from earlier with no problems. I went to watch a tape and the tape wouldn't display on the screen. Then the clock screen went black and unit started making a buzzing noise! So now my VCR/DVD is completely dead and non functional after less than 5 yrs for no reason whatsover! Don't waste your money with this crap! And I'll never purchase another Samsung product again!"
1,"Works, but not for long - FRUSTRATING","We bought this unit as a Christmas present for my parents who are in their 80's and who rarely watch DVD movies. We wanted them to have it not only so they could experience the new technology, but more importantly so they could enjoy DVD's of family memories that the rest of us have.1.) After watching a DVD we couldn't get back to the regular TV screen without unplugging the whole unit, until we randomly discovered that by putting a videotape in then ejecting it, the problem healed itself. THAT's stupid design!For this reason, my parents wouldn't watch anything unless one of us was visiting.2.)After less than 10 hours of use, the DVD player ""could not read"" the disk.Instead of joy in sharing, we got frustration.Should we get them another, will they feel confident enough to use it? DON'T get this product. DO read reviews before you purchase."
2,Poor combo,"The VCR is noisy, it actually makes a vibration that affects the video qulaity during recording or playback of a pre-recorded tape.The remote is not layed out very well, the on screen menu is confusing and difficult to navigate through.I should have been clued in when I bought this unit, there were six units in boxes, two of them were open box specials (returns). You can probably guess why they were returned.I'm returning this item and getting separate DVD and VCR units."
1,Load put on consumer rather then tech support -- beware...,"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with this unit. I already have a Samsung 3500, which works very well. The new ""feature"" for the 4600 (really anything above a 3650) is that the input needs to be changed to LINE when you want to watch a DVD/VHS; and changed BACK when you want to watch cable. As this was purchased for my 80 year old parents, they were too confused to have to keep changing back, and did not use the unit.I called Samsung tech support (who were super), and they said they are getting a boat load of calls on this very issue. It seems it was easier/cheaper for their techies to develop with the consumer having to do the switching manually.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this model. There are too many other choices that work well and don't have this quirk."
1,Stay away from Samsung unit,"This machine is simply unreliable. When I played VHS tapes, a number of the tapes appeared distorted on the screen, with the top portion of the image wavy. This could not be fixed using the tracking button on the machine. I am returning mine to the vendor."
2,Samsung DVD/VCR Combo,"We did not own a DVD player, and with since so many DVD's have extras such as commentaries and added footage, we decided it was time to buy one. Since our VCR had some age on it, we decided to get this DVD/VCR combo. First of all, it would not work at all on our 11 year old Magnavox TV, so we bought a new TV. Then we found that the VCR has a buzzing noise which is very annoying, so we hooked our old VCR back up. The only good quality about this unit is that we get good results with the DVD player. I would not recommend this Samsung DVD/VCR unit. There have to be better combos out there on the market."
2,Really poor!!,"I bought this book to help me in my first trip to South America. That means that I didn't have any idea of the kind of birds I coud have found there. Good, after I saw the images, I didn't have a better idea than before! The pictures are really bad! Impossible to recognize a bird in the field with that. The text is also quite poor, the only thing I found quite good is the good description of the habitats. But, anyway, if you don't know the birds of Argentina, better buy another guide... this one is really not useful."
5,one of my dreams,"would be to play like Art Tatum for an evening. This book kind of let's you do that, if you have the time, dedication and a broad enough left hand (or a pre-modern narrower keyboard). As another reviewer said, not for the faint of heart, but almost anything is possible if you are willing to spend the time. The selection of pieces by Edstrom is excellent, including the classic Tatum version of Cherokee and an early Tatum recording of Stormy Weather - probably the most accessible and mild-tempo'd piece in the group. I've learned more about jazz piano from this collection than anything I have played. And, the thing with Tatum is that you can slow down the tempo several-fold and it still sounds great. By the way, anyone have a transcription of Chlo-e?"
4,Awesome!,"Yea, Tatum is magnificent! Reading the transcriptions while listening to the recordings just makes his playing even more amazing and enjoyable. This book is great and can keep you very busy. By the way, if you want to play like Art there is a another book, ""The Right Hand According to Tatum"" which has even more transcriptions and tells you how to finger and use his runs. It has some analysis etc. This book could have used a bit of that. Good Luck!"
1,never shippin me,"shameful...poor outstanding nice service fastly bad nice working, where is my book? never heard from service or none... hope you see it"
3,"Titanic Serenade, Music from an age of elegance","It is quite nice Parlor Music but not Salon Orchestra as I understand it or as I anticipated. Somewhat Heinze Variety trying to cover all the bases, perhaps this Music is what the spectrum presented on the Titanic represents The Brass wasn't what I expected, I anticipated Piano, a couple violins,cello, bass kind of presentation. pleasant however."
2,Bloody boring,"For a book about a band who wear their excesses on their nostrils, there's very few lurid tales. We get superficial, one-dimensional analysis of their Irish-Mancunian roots, and the story of their childhoods and family backgrounds . We get directionless, frequently irrelevent details. Such as full transcripts of Noel-Liam arguments about nothing. Little morning glory, lots of boring story....."
5,When Opposites Dance,"When I pick up a book I want relevance, clarity, and inspiration. I got all three in this book and that is why I just ordered 10 more copies for my friends!It is a fabulous read for anyone who takes seriously their journey with self awareness and leadership. The personalites anaylzed are well-known and interesting, the chapters are concise and well-organized and the take-home value is immediate and longlasting.I would recommend it for anyone who desires a practical mechanism for personal growth and leadership maturation. I intend to use it with all the staff members of the church where I am a pastor. Matter of fact, it would be a great resource for leadership teams to use in team-building opportunities.Dan Francis"
5,Thanks Dr. Williams,"In over 40 years of leadership and management covering manufacturing, textiles, furniture, municipalities and hospitals, this book is the clearest, most effective management/leadership book ever. Takes Dr. Deals' book to new and exciting directions. Predict great things for this effort. What is next?"
5,Doggy Dental,My groomer suggested this for my dog because as he's gotten a little older his breath has gotten yucky. Noticed a huge difference after using it consistenly for only a few weeks. It's definetly worth it.
2,:(,I really wanted this to work! my dogs a small toy and the product isnt powerful enough for his mighty Koi Breath..Fast ..great seller..just not that pleased with the product.
5,Great football tale!,"My first graders love this book! My class is filled with pro football fans, and this is one of the few books on the subject. Although the vocabulary is challenging for 1st graders, they can read it because of the cumulative pattern the author uses and because they know so much of the vocabulary of the sport. EXCELLENT!"
1,Very Annoying,"The reading level is age 4-8 years and I wouldn't recommend introducing it to a younger audience. My 2-1/2 year old son LOVES football, but as soon as the illustrations ""pan out"" to include the stadium he loses interest (he wants to see the football and the football players, not the fans and certainly NOT the blimp). The text is incredibly disappointing, monotonous, and relentless. I actually threw the book in the garbage after two months because I couldn't bear to read it again!"
1,Requires tapes as part of the package,"My order arrived without the audio tapes that are necessary for the listening section of the test. I have used Delta TOEFL before and it is good, but I had to ask for a refund when the supplier couldn't supply the tapes or CDs."
2,REESE COUPLER LOCK,THIS VERSION OF THE REESE LOCK IS VERY FLIMSY AND ONLY LOCKS ON ONE SIDE. I HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT HAS A MUCH LARGER ROD THAT LOCKS AND I THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT I WAS GETTING WHEN I ORDERED THIS ONE. THIS IS A VERY LIGHTWEIGHT LOCK AND I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR SECURITY REASONS. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY
3,Coupler lock,"Easy smooth action. Not the strongest on the market, but more than meets my needs. Cast aluminum frame is easier to handle when attaching"
5,A MUST LOCK,"YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IN LOCKING, IT WORKS GREAT, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERY WHO HAS A TRAILER."
1,Absolutely terrible lock,"I had misplaced my key for this lock and took a simple household hammer to see if I could get the lock off. To my amazement, 1 simple swing from the hammer and the lock popped off. Do not purchase this lock. I would recommend the California Immobilizer."
2,Easy to defeat using your own trailer jack against you,"All you have to do to bust this lock is set a concrete block underneath the prongs that stick down out of the base of the lock and lower the jack so the trailer's weight is resting on the U-bar. Voila, you'll hear a loud pop and the lock will be broken. Happened to me when I was changing the manual jack over to an electric one. Now I know and will be finding another kind of lock to replace this broken one.I still give it a rating of 2 because it WILL keep honest people honest. I tried prying it off when I got it and it was solid as a rock but it's NOT a good security lock."
1,No security.,"After owning two of these and the two had had the same problem. The actual pin came off of the holder. I locked it and with all the vibration it just came right off, so much for security. Thiefs I am sure know how easy it is to pick on this lock. Do not buy. just my two cents."
4,Reese Trailer Lock Review,"I have had 2 of these locks for a few months now. I feel as if this product is adequate for the price paid. As you rotate the key it feels a bit rough pulling the locking tooth out of the grooves, and to me feels more like cheaper machining than any type of malfunction. Again, the product is on par for what you pay for it. I am keeping the locking mechanism sprayed down with lubricant and will continue to do so. The metal this is made from feels of the type of quality that will give in to rusting pretty easily. If I lived in a more salty environment, I dont' think I would be happy with this product over time. As it is, I am in the desert and forsee no problems with longevity for this product."
1,Thieves broke the lock and stole my trailer,Don't bother with this lock. I noticed my trailer gone and this lock laying on the ground in two pieces. Apparently they shoved a prybar between the chrome U-bar and snapped it. I doubt the lock slow down a thief for more than 5 seconds.
1,"Not very good security, do not buy.","The ""key"" if you want to call it that is a total joke. They almost all have the same keys and at that its a very easy lock to pick. Also the pin (I believe its technical name is a ""locking dog"") that holds the shackle from sliding out does not protrude much which makes it possible to, without much force, force the lock open. It appears to be heavy strong steel and might be somewhat hard to cut but very easy to pick or force open. I would try another lock."
3,Didn't fit my trailer tongue,"I ordered this moderately priced ""Universal"" lock, and it didn't fit over the tongue of my trailer. This not why I rated it with 3 stars. The locking mechanism does not appear to very high quality, but I guess it's what you might expect for around $20. I ordered a different model for about twice the price and it seems to be worth the extra money."
1,THE FREAKIN' TUMBLER POPPED RIGHT OUT!!,"I bought this unit at a local ""Wally-World"" for 25 bucks. Only had it a couple weeks. I know it's not the best, but I just thought it would at least slow someone down to the point that they would not be able to run off with my camper before drawing a lot of attention. So I went to hook up my camper for a trip, and as I unlocked this thing, THE TUMBLER CAME OUT! Lot o' good that is!That said, I found a MUCH better unit- just a shame Amazon does not carry this one:[...]Sure, it's a good bit more. But as they say- you get what you pay for!"
1,Easiest lock to cut off,"I sell cargo/utility trailers and everytime a customer comes in to purchase a new trailer because their old on was stolen even with a lock on the front i ask the ""was it the yellow one with a u-bolt on top?"" they say ""yes how did you know?"" That lock is the easiest to cut off. a cordless grinder takes about 10 sec. to cut the u-bolt and it drops. Check out the Fulton Gorilla Guard. It is the most secure lock that we know of."
2,Iffy,"I purchased this for a Buyers coupler. Although it does fit, loosely, I feel I wouldn't have a problem forcing it off and it wouldn't be a problem to saw through or cut the 3/8"" curved steel clamp. That said, I've tried a couple other locks of which did not work at all...so this is, I guess, better than nothing and should at least slow down theft of a trailer. If I find a lock that I know beforehand will work to my liking, this one will go into the junk pile."
2,Can't get spare key,"The lock works fine but the problem is that I can't find a locksmith who can get a key blank to make spare keys. That is a real problem. And, I haven't found a resource on the internet for a blank either."
4,Heavy and strong,Feels like it's well made I just wish it had a cover over the key lock to protect it from the weather.
1,Panasonic EW176 Disappointing!,"I'm about to throw out my second EW176. The first one never made good contact with batteries and kept dying on me; the second one is just about ready to give up the ghost -- the pulse is slow and erratic and finally dies to a dead stop. I've changed the batteries (which it eats up rapidly) to no avail. I've cleaned it! to no avail. The reservoir holds very little water. Great size (really is compact) and weight, but...in the end...disappointing. I'm looking for a new portable oral irrigator!"
1,WTF?,"How on earth do you folks expect us out here to buy this product given that you don't even include the size of it? Is it 1 1/2"", is it 3"", is it 4"". How can you say it slips right on. Right on to what?"
5,This is an exceptional story by an exceptional writer.,"Clay's Ark is a wonderful taut, gripping and suspenseful tale. Butler really forces the reader to analyze his or her perceptions of what it really means to be human by delving deeply in to human behavior and ethical issues. Ethical issues such as: gang violence, racism, suicide, artificial insemination, AIDS, etc. I highly recommend the text. It should be required reading in literature classes for students to discuss and write about ""big questions"" and problems that affect our world. Further, Ms. Butler's use of metaphor, simile and foreshadowing is outstanding. The images she creates with words are vivid and concise. Any reader can visualize this story.I wish that whoever wrote the synopsis of the book for the web page knew that Asa Elias Doyle is a male, not a female!"
3,Not Butler's Best,"I was so enthralled by ""Dawn"" and the subsequent books in that trilogy that I set out to read everything I could by Butler. Overall I find her novels to be exceptional sci-fi with some very thought provoking anthropology and history thrown into the mix. I was disappointed in Clay's Ark, and I think it was primarily because, compared to Butler's other novels, it was the leanest. While she comments on the bleak direction the future of the U.S. is headed in, this tale did not stay with me or terrify me the way the ""Parable"" books did. I didn't feel as attached to these characters as I did to their parallel counterparts in the Patternmaster. It's an interesting story, but not Butler at her best. If you're as obsesseive as I am about my favorite authors, read it anyway! If you're new to Butler, start with Parable of the Sower or Dawn."
4,Deeply engrossing,"This book commanded me to read it in one sitting. This is something few novels can do given my relatively short attention span. This book falls under the ""What happens when ET microbes come to earth"" category. Hint - we usually die. If you like this book, try Blood Music by Greg Bear."
4,Can it really happen?,"Being the Octavia Butler fan I am, I must say (without bias) that I found this book interesting. When I read any of her books, I don't do so with any preconceived notions or expectations. . . Just crack the cover and get going.If you're used to her style you know it's about us on earth and a being or beings from another world. The most interesting thing here is that you can take any of the present-day medical situations and insert it here.Since this was one of her first books I read, I was truly eager to reach the end. This is a must if you want to complete the Patternists series, as well as a creativity motivator. Enjoy."
3,"again, a slow start","Perhaps Butler must establish a concept before she really gets going with it in sequels. It is another mark of the great depth of her imaginative powers, which surpass any scifi writer that I know.I did not get into the characters of the Clayarks as much as her other characters. This novel seemed more labored than her other efforts, thinner, much as Dawn inaugurated her mutagensis series.It is only later that the true depth and elegance of her vision comes out."
3,too much soap opera,"This book of the Patternist series is a bit like watching a soap opera. Remove the alien and you'd pretty much have the same story for a variety of motivations -- disease, social outcasts, etc. Once more we are almost overwhelmed by the number of characters and not given quite enough background or insight into developing a strong sense of empathy with any character."
1,Not What I Expected!,"Having been personally involved in one of the author's political campaigns for quite a few years, I was disappointed with the content of the book. The comments regarding volunteers were very offensive and arrogant to me. I feel the book was very superficial as are most politicians. It would have been more enjoyable reading had they written more about their own personal experiences. They sold themselves short with this one."
1,"Awful, Boring, and Wrong!","This book was simply awful. The author(s) are clearly more interested in their own ego (I was in the room when such and such happened) than in informing the reader. In fact, the GOP author's (Mr. Towery) entire elected career consists of 4 years in the Georgia State House. How much could he possibly have experienced? There is more good political insight available on numerous websites. Don't waste your money."
4,Better than the others...,The product is a trendy and aesthetically designed shaver...I had used some other brands earlier but never was satisfied;but the Panasonic shaver is easy to use and gives good results.The long hair trimmer attatchment is very useful.It is a a little highly priced but it is fairly deserving of that price.
1,Piece of overpriced crap,"I bought this to replace a great Norelco that, unfortunately, died on me. This thing is completely useless...unless you need an expensive, rechargable paper weight. It takes FOREVER to do the lower portion of one leg, let alone all of both of them...who's got that kind of time?!?! About the only thing I've found that it's good for is to catch those little spots that you invariably miss with the razor in the shower.Don't waste your money on this one."
2,below average while it lasted,"I was browsing the razors when I noticed that this one (the panasonic ES208A Ladies' Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver) was still for sale. I bought mine some time ago and used it (dry) and found it to be uncomfortable to use, not to mention, a little difficult to clean during and afterwards. I also got nicked whenever I did the underarms and knees. I've tried so many shavers that I can't remember how many, but I did find that (in general) the remingtons, especially with a plug, worked the very best of all the shavers I had. BTW, I also tried Veet and that was a big waste of $$, not to mention time. Nothing (for me) shaves closer than a manual double bladed wet razor, NOTHING."
4,Panasonic ES208A Shaver,"This shaver is okay for the price. It caused some razor chaffing on my legs, but like I said for the price its okay and I will continue to use it. I had another Panasonic razor that was better an gentler, but it is now over 50.00 and I went with the cheaper one."
1,Very Disappointing.,"If you're going to order this book, you better order a magnifying glass also. The text is about half the size of the 8 pt. type I can print out of my computer. 4 pt.? Maybe 6 pt.? Anyway, it's really, really small.Another flaw, which is aggravated by the small print, is the quality of the printing. Sometimes the text is so light you can barely make it out and sometimes it's so heavy that the ""a""s and ""e""s turn into indistinguishable blobs. All on the same page!Finally, you know how dictionaries have the first and last words found on the page, at the top of the page? This is a great aid when you're trying to find a word among a bunch of little tiny words that all start with the same first few letters. This author/publisher didn't think they were important. They're just not there. Bummer.All in all, the German Military Dictionary by the US War Dept. and published by Lancer Militaria is a better buy. It's much easier to use."
1,Why put down free enterprise?,It's beyond me why people who choose not to take advantage of the free enterprise system wants to put down the successful people who do. Amway is an opportunity for anyone to achieve success in their own business. It has everything to offer an entrepanuer. Amway is and will continue to be a driving force in commerce all around the world.
1,Way too biased. Mr. Butterfield sounds like a crybaby !,"It appears Mr. Butterfield is bent on bashing a company to make himself feel better about failing. Anyone with enough intelligence to do their own research before deciding if this business model is right for them or not should not be listening to a whiner like Butterfield. Cult? Give me a break. After 40+ years in business, that one is getting a little old. Don't waste your money on this slamfest, read something from an unbiased source like Paul Conn instead, and do your homework the right way."
1,Purely subjective!,"This book is purely biased and subjective. In any kind of business, there will always be a positive and negative side. Obviously,this person focused more on the negative side due to his bad experience with Amway.It isn't the company's fault when you fail in the business you ventured on. It is understandable that if you didn't make it in any business, you will always say negative things about it.So obviously this author has been burned by Amway, thus he spreads negative things about it based on his one-sided purely biased opinions. Opinions are just opinions - but it doesn't make it a fact!A fact is the truth!. I recommend that you read other books by Frank Feather."
4,Butterfield reached all the right conclusions!,"Stephen Butterfield gathered the sketchy information available to him in the early 1980s about the Amway business, and drew the correct conclusions: the money in an Amway distributorship does NOT come from the sale of Amway products or recruiting others to sell, but from the motivational tools and function business. It is very well written, and includes compelling anecdotal information to support the author's contentions that Amway is ""the cult of free enterprise"" rather than true free enterprise. A very important book for anyone considering joining Amway/Quixtar, or who has friends or relatives who are involved."
5,Must reading,This book should be required reading for anyone considering joining this cult. This book could literally keep your life from being destroyed.
1,Don't believe everything you read,"Sure, some people are going to have bad experiences in business ventures....it doesn't matter if it's in a business like amway or IBM...there will be some positive stories and some negative ones. Trying to be unbiased, I have read many books and articles about the pros and cons of the amway business, and to tell you the truth, I've encountered a far greater percentage of positive feedback than negative. Sure, there have been some nightmare encounters with the business, but I'm sure that you will find those encounters to be common in every corporate business venture, MLM, or otherwise.My advice to you is that if you are interested in a company like amway, read everything you can get your hands on, positive and negative, and then decide for yourself whether to venture onward or not. Don't believe everything you read, pro OR con."
2,One sided comentary about a broad business.,My opinion will be parcial becouse I have been on both sides of the fence. First of I was never lied to about anything I ever asked about. Thats the mistake people make when theye start a business they never ask the right quistion's.
5,A GREAT STRESS BUSTER,"Need a break from the demanding pace of your hectic life???If you are seeking solace & peace, buy this CD."
4,"If you need direction, this is the map....","If you are looking for the path to dynamic content, this book is a great way to get your feet wet without drowning in a sea of highbrow terminology. For those of us who just got comfortable with HTML 3.2, this is a wonderful way to explore the other facets of web design. I Enjoyed the basic start and detailed endings to each section. It effectively builds upon the previous information to speed you along your way to interactive Web Design."
4,"Excllent reference, good intro to DHTML & XML, CD++","Having read several books on HTML & XML, including the Laura Lemay series, and living most evenings in RFC's and the W3C online documentation, I have found that this is an excellent reference manual to lay flat when I am online and need something quickly explained. The basics of XML are well thought out, as are the intro chapters on JavaScript. I particulary liked the CDROM with it's extensive collection of other QUE titles and source in electronic format (pdf and html)."
4,Overview of major web-techniques,"This book is a bible. It covers every hot topics about Internet developments. It is well-structured and contains a lot of interesting examples. It pinpoints web site and page design techniques, presents HTML, DHTML, scripting languages and the major browse object model, security, ASP, and talks about server-side scripting (CGI,PERL). You have to consider this book as a big reference, giving major guidelines. Moreover it allows you to find a way in the Internet world. Unfortunately, for covering so much subjects, authors have avoided to write down too much details. Sometimes it disappointing. It is a good book for people wanting to find out information about the Internet and its tools."
1,I've seen it. It's as bad as you would expect.,"The message is pretty clear: don't trust pencil-necked geek scientists (check out the protester's costume for verification) or artists (in the video game version of this atrocity the villian abducts children into a reconstructed world ""where nothing is real"" called A.R.T.) and don't question what you're told (the protester's weapon is the 'iconoclastic-skepticizer').The message is clear: if you happen to come across a teacher or parent who is skeptical, politically protests, enjoys art, or questions authority, this person is the enemy of God, a living incarnation of evil, little more than a demon to be destroyed."
5,Long Time Subscriber,"I have been reading Foreign Affairs for more than 30 years. It is an integral part of a broad-based understanding of international issues, both current and historical. It can also be very prescient at times. (See Clash of Civilizations, 1993)The articles are not to be rushed through. Read them slowly and savor them, whether you agree with them or not. Give it a try!"
2,Cheaper at foreignaffairs.com,"Same product (1-year subscription for new subscriber in the US) is available at foreignaffairs.com at $38 for print + digital, or $32 for either one alone. Why spend more here?"
2,"Good content, bad marketing practices","I DO NOT recommend you subscribe to the magazine, either from here or anywhere else. This is unless you want a bunch of junk mail because they sell your information before you even get the first issue. Absolutely ridiculous! Will not be signing up again."
1,Council On Foreign Relations- New World Order!,"The ""Foreign Affairs"" magazine is ran by the Council on Foreign Relations, a New World Order proto with members such as Madeilene Albright, Henry Kissinger and other war criminals. They are manipulating the united states foreign policy."
5,Thought-provoking: Let's talk to each other,"Like many Americans, I am weary of ugly words and harsh actions between Americans who are poles apart politically. Robert E. McAuley presents his case for decency and dialogue in a reasonable and highly intelligent fashion. Conservatives as well as liberals could benefit from reading Dr. McAuley's well-thought out and logical presentation. Who knows -- if we as Americans followed his lead and tried diligently to find common ground, we could perhaps resolve key divisive issues.Paul R. De MaagdHolland, Michigan"
4,Different Tragedies,"Even though DOLL is classified as science fiction, and the doll (rather like androids) theme is strong throughout, that's not the main focus.It's divided into six different stories, each one involving many of the sadder aspects and emotions of human life. If you want to be cheered up, this manga won't do that for you, although I don't think it would make you sad, either. Since it deals with the way people can grow (or be torn) apart, and the voids and obessions resulting from that, it's very thought-provoking and unique. The difference between the tired, angry, sad, or blank expressions of humans (although there is some happiness too) and the long-lashed concern of dolls is fascinating.DOLL doesn't preach; it Questions. When a human cares for nothing but a doll, and a doll cares for its (her? his?) and others' safety and happiness, who really is humane? And what makes us different from anything else, anyway?Maybe after reading DOLL you'll find some answers."
5,Great manga!,"One of my favorite mangas. These individual stories revolving around the droids known as ""dolls"" are highly enjoyable and often deep, meaningful, as well as macabre. Though the later volumes are not as good as the first, I am amazed at how the mangaka is able to create a great variety of compelling and thoughtful tales around a single subject."
3,good value,"Like previous reviews, these came in a very unpadded box. I originally thought they might be too short because the box was short. It was fine in terms of height, because the box height was the exact height of the stools. There was no packing material whatsoever, so it was somewhat miraculous that it arrived without being damaged. Mine arrived fine, and I love them! Great price for the pair."
3,"Great Product, Crap Packaging Everytime",I read the reviews about the packaging and ordered anyway because it sounded like people were getting some good chairs. Well after receiving 10 different chairs I can tell you that every chair that I received had noticeable damage. The worse damage was bumps around the beveled edge of the seat.Unless you can deal with bumps around the edge of the seat I would highly recommend buying somewhere else.
5,helps me enormously,I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I am so stressed out because of my mother. What I like best is all I have to do is open the book to the chapter that has what I want and all the answer are right there. Last night I read about tips on getting my mom to quit driving. No long paragraphs to read - easy to follow. I love the resouces - there are alot of them. A huge help.
5,A real time saver,One thing I hate worse than wasting money is wasting time. This book gave me all the answers - fast and easy to understand. The checklists are the best. So are the questions. I literally did not have to think of a thing - Joy gives solutions to every problem you can expect to find yourself in. Get this book if your parents are getting older. It saved me a lot of time and money.
5,Great ideas for help,"For somebody who likes to read a lot, but has limited amounts of time, I like this book on caring for aging parents the best. It's a fast read. I just go to the specific topic I need to know about and all of the answers and resources for help are there. I also like the checklists - they are helpful."
4,Vital help,"This book is full of clear, common-sense talk, just the thing I needed when I bought it. Dealing with an aging parent can be tricky in the best of circumstances, and at worst can threaten the whole family structure. The level-headed advice in this book can help to keep things on track, and can help family members to develop the best plan for dealing with their particular situation, as it did with us.I did a ""speed-read"" of the book in the 24 hours before a family conference. I did note a fair amount of repetition of ideas in the book, but that is not necessarily a bad thing: if you're reading just the chapters that seem most relevant, then that's where those ideas need to be mentioned. One bonus: reading the book made it clear to me that I need to be doing some elder planning for myself, and with my own children, to make things easier for them later."
5,Tops my list of recommended books for physicians,"This is a terrific book full of good advice and practical suggestions. All the physicians and other health care professionals who attend my workshops on patient communications throughout the nation, have Joy Loverdes's book at the top of their recommended reading list. This is the most thorough and complete resource on the topic of eldercare that I have found. It should be kept handy on a nearby shelf for ready reference over the years!

Author of ""Communicating With Today's Patient; Essentials to Save Time, Decrease Risk and Increase Patient Compliance"" Jossy-Bass, a Wiley Company, September 2000"
1,DO NOT BUY!,This product is completely misleading its advertised as “Fat Free” as a healthy alternative to traditional cup of noodles but they leave out the fact that there is 1175 MG of sodium per cup! Can you really say that’s healthy? Uh No… waste of money!
4,a perfect attractiom to our Pharor Aquarium,"this item with our added blue led lights that surround the base and the blue lcd light that face the spnix, only added to the wonderful look of our egyptian Pharor aquarium"
2,Overpriced,"They are asking a LOT of money for a cheap piece of cloth. And it is NOT for taller people...I'm only 6'2"" and it was like a mini-skirt. I was able to quickly make a new one that was longer, warmer and better quality for no money...just a little time. Why i didn't do that to begin with? My own foolishness I suppose."
4,Recommended for anyone with dyslexia!,"We use Via Voice 8 and love it. My 11 yo son is dyslexic. By using Via Voice he can dictate all his writing assignments. He wouldn't be able to keep up with his composition work without it.I use the read back function to ""read"" news articles on the web. I can hop on my treadmill while Mr. Woodrow, the talking pencil reads website content to me.And, best of all, (price). In fact I am here buying this product for other family members now!"
4,IBM ViaVoice for Windows-Release 9,"This comes with a noise-canceling headset that includes a microphone. It is not by IBM. It works with Microsoft Word 2002 the best, but will also allow dictation to other software. Your words can be read back to you by an agent which is actually a robot that appears when you summon it. It can also read back aloud words that you didn't type; in other words, any text it ""sees"" which is rather ingenius. It will make corrections if you speak over it when you see an error. You can also teach ViaVoice new words after it has learned to recognize your voice and inflections in your speech by creating your voice model. IBM gives you a 95-page User's Guide with black and white pictures to illustrate procedures."
4,Enjoyably eclectic!!,"What a thrill it is for me to tell you that I went to school with Jayme, and that her voice has been a true asset to her for many years! My wife and I share the c.d. from truck to van, and our daughter enjoys the songs as well. I was able to hear her over the 2002 summer and am anxiously waiting for her new crop of music to arrive for the public to enjoy. If you do not yet have this collection, get it! You will enjoy it!"
3,Not a bad printer,"I've had my printer for almost 18 months, and I've had very little problems with it. I did recently have to replace the printhead when it kept telling to replace the ink cartridge or that there wasn't one in it. $... It's printed very reliably for me. The photos I've printed were wonderful, and that was without the extra photo cartridge which allows it to use 7 colors.My only complaint it that you find out you're out of ink the hard way (no color) and that the ink tanks are not individual. The inks are certainly cheap enough to replace compared to my mother's Lexmark.If I didn't know that I could buy another Canon with individual ink tanks, and an ink monitoring system, I'd rebuy this printer in a heartbeat. In fact, when I do replace it, my husband wants this one! :) I'm going to upgrade to the S500 soon."
2,Pick something else,"I have the Canon 5000 and the 5100. Both are essentially the same printers, except for its parallel port protocol. If you have Win95 or Win98, then this is a decent printer. This series of printers' use a proprietary printing language, so getting third party support or moving this printer to another platform/OS is out.It does print on multiple paper formats, and is very good at printing photo grade images, but is very lousy at letter sized envelops. Not a very robust printer, especially when the print cartridges are hard to find and expensive. For the cost of two cartridges you can get another new Canon BJC-5100 printer.These printers are also ""Win printers"" <BOLD>BUT</BOLD>, they do support ""HP Laserjet II"" protocol. Its undocumented, but all laser printers and Jet Ink printers support this. So if you need to use it on a machine that it is not compatible on, then at least you can print in black.Look at HP products, they have better support and cartridges are a lot cheaper."
3,"Adequate for less-demanding, simple graphics and text","Canon is not the printer to get if you want high-quality graphics. Adequate for simple color graphics and text, but many other similar-priced products are far ahead in terms of graphics output quality.If you want photo-realistic color, go for an Epson (preferably the Epson 750) or Lexmark (Z51 is pretty good)."
1,A THIRST FOR EXPENSIVE INK,"I was enticed by the supposed ""photo quality"" of this printer, which of course looked great in the store. I have had a continual problem with what I see on my monitor, not being what I get out of this printer. Serious color discrepancies. I have spent much time reworking a photo to get it to where I think the printer might respond to my liking. It's too much guesswork, I don't have the desire to try to get inside my printer's mind that much. The really aggravating thing is the cost of the photo ink cartridge, at approximately $50 a pop. Ouch! And let me tell you, this thing is thirsty! After buying a couple of those, you could get a much better printer, which I'm about to do. OOps! For everyday printing of text and some graphics, I suppose it's adequate. However, if you need to print photos, don't bother with this printer, I wish I hadn't."
1,don't buy it,"This printer has given me constant problems. For one, it kept telling me that it was not connected when it was. When I print a test page it prints, but when I print from a Word Document or Photoshop it doesn't. It also tells me that it is out of ink when I just replaced it recently. The orange light is also constantly blinking telling me that there is a problem. This printer is a pain... Their customer service is something you have to pay for. don't buy it!"
1,sooo dissapointed---,"I recently bought this model from my mom who had used it maybe twice. My intention was to use it for papers and occasionally photos, not really caring about the quality, more of durability. However I bought it from her in August and now it is November and kaput! It keeps telling me I need ink, so I go and buy the (...) cartridges and it still says i need ink. Done all troubleshooting and maintence possible, called canon, and they want money (...) to even talk to me. I'm soooo upset. I had heard about Canon's low quality, and now i know it. Printer lasted a little over a year 6 days to be exact (hmmm funny their warranty is only a year) with minimal to moderate usage and now i just want to throw it my window... I'm gonna go buy an Epson. If you know whats good for you, dont buy a canon!!!"
3,It doesn't build basic vocabulary,"The vocabulary it builds is more casual vocabulary. I did not know that when I bought it. But the reason for the 3 star rating is the pictures. On many strips the pictures are the same from one scene to the next, not giving many contectual cues. It is interesting because in the preface to the book, it states that as an important feature of the book. Then it doesn't follow the features. There is at least one sequence that is almost the same from the top of the bottom all the way to the bottom of the page with just different mouths moving. What can of contetual cues are supposed to be gathered from that?"
5,Cookbook,I'm lucky enough to be within distance of the Stinking Rose in S.F. I love that place. I love the cookbook..has all of the favorites!! Like the garlic relish!!! Mmmmmmm Good stuff!!
3,Genesis In London (Keep it Dark),"I'm just about half way through this DVD and while I agree that musically the band is tight during this performance however visually (as I stated in the title), it's way too dark! My only experience seeing Genesis during this era they were heavy into the ""Mirrors"" and ""laser show"" (Then there were Three tour), very bright and exciting. The Duke Tour obviously was a different story all together.Also Phil has some real ""issues"" with this crowd,(the crowd gives Phil hell throughout the performance) not to mention his stories are pretty lame. !If you're a fan of this era of Genesis, you'll like this DVD, they step back into the ""past"" a couple of times which is nice but I always appreciate a band who isn't afraid to display their current album that's being promoted! They run through most of the Duke album."
2,Bootleg of poor video quality,"Upon receiving this it was swiftly apparent that it is a bootleg. And not a good one. Homemade menus, one audio track. At least the song titles are spelled properly!The video on this DVD is very bad YouTube quality at best. It is literally the worst looking thing I've ever seen on DVD.The audio is okay. Not great, but okay. If you want to experience this concert look online for good audio versions of the show.The video appears to have been professionally recorded (back in 1980 when production values weren't as they are today). It's not some guy in the audience with one video cam or super8. The video is sort of nice to see, but it's so blurry and so pixelated you'll just be frustrated.If I'd paid more than $10 I'd return it."
2,Genesis live in London,sound quality not so great picture is dark but great for the Sirius Genesis fan. the song ripples is only half the song all the other songs are great.
1,Genesis in London 1980,"My expectation about this product was high. I have seen this concert in YouTube and I wanted to have it permanently. Unfortunately the quality of the images is very poor. There is a logo on the screen at all times. The DVD was scratched when I opened the box. I thought that was used, but I bought it brand new! I do not recommend this DVD"
1,The Ultimate Sales Gimmick,What a great deal: buy my Meal Replacement Powder.. with a list price of $24.95 to own the ad in hard cover.
1,Diet plan too low in calories,"Just to start out, the diet plan consists of about 900-1000 calories daily. Some days it goes a little higher, probably trying to keep your body out of starvation mode. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book because of the low calories. It also is a low carb diet, so initally you will see some weight drop off, but just remember it is water loss. I don't like following low carb diets because as soon as I add in carbs, of course the weight comes back. (Carbs hold water- but no matter what, I don't like seeing numbers go down and come back up)If someone has quite a bit of weight to lose, don't buy this books. Because it is so extreme, people tend to lose motivation and feel too deprived. I am pretty lean myself, and I did not enjoy trying to follow this plan. Stick to a diet more balanced with healthy carbs, protein, and fats for a lifelong plan."
5,Honoring Myself,"I love this book!What I've learned from David's plan is that exercise isn't a chore or punishment; it's a way of honoring myself. He's right - it is a reward.I now know that healthful eating isn't a prison sentence, it is as David says a freeing experience. I feel like me, the best me. Thank you David."
3,"A ""sensible"" crash diet","This book outlines an 8 week program, where the average caloric intake is about 900 calories per day. Those calories are very much skewed towards lean proteins and veggies. In the ""less restrictive"" phases of the diet, small amounts of certain fruits and grains are added.I suspect that someone who can keep to under 900 calories per day for 8 weeks is not going to need to shell out 15 to 25 bucks for this book.I also question the safety of eating under 1,000 calories per day (there is no allowance made for gender or activity level.)In addition to eating only about 900 calories per day, the author recommends a fairly intense weight training and cardio interval program.Now where does the ""sensible"" come in? The 900 calories are well balanced between the lean protein, the veggies and ""good"" fats.If someone has an 8 week timeline for some major event...a wedding, a class reunion, a cruise, e.g., this is a pretty decent way to ""sensibly crash diet""."
5,"Tom Eishen, author Courage on Little Round Top",The book is a mixture of quotes from those who lived through the Civil War and black and white images of reenactors and the Antietam Battlefield. The quotes are very thought provoking and when combined with the stunning images it almost transports you back to that troubled time. A rare book you can will be able to enjoy for years to come.
4,Worth downloading illicitly!,"Of course I didn't BUY this CD. I wanted to buy it. But... it hasn't been released in the US yet. And I don't pay $30 for a CD. You know, because the 1s and 0s on the CD are ""imported"" and therefore the price on them must be doubled. Eventually, the music industry will figure out that consumers won't pay $30 for a CD anymore, just because of an archaic notion of IMPORT releases being price gouged for twice as much as DOMESTIC relases. When that day comes, I will be happy to purchase a copy of this excellent album for a reasonable price. Until then, the music industy can go FuXoR themselves."
1,Very dissapointed!,"I was very dissapointed with this product! The USB headset that comes with it will not work on all 3 of my comupters! I contacted Plantronics, and they told me it wasn't compatible with the Intel USB chipset on my motherboards. 3 Computers, and I can't use the thing!Also, ViaVoice keeps crashing my computer. It works great when it works, but I'm afraid to use it be it causes my otherwise stable system to lock up every 15-20 minutes or so. I think this product is still buggy and not quite ready for prime time. Buyer beware!"
2,"OK, not great","I tried both Via Voice 8 and 9. For the most part I still prefer L&H; Voice Xpress V.4The accuracy of IBM Via Voice V 9 is better, but lacks featurs such as adjusting the microphone level found in Voice Xpress.I see that version 10 of Via Voice is out as an upgrade (a change in the previous policy). I would have considered spending the $90 or so bucks to upgrade and get the mike control for background noise, but I never got my $75 rebate from IBM for purchasing Version 9 a year ago. You can get Voice Xpress V 4 (standard) with the Platronics DSP folding headset for the price of the Upgrade cost of Via Voice alone. A better way to go if you are on a budget."
2,"SOME RECOGNITION, but HOURS of talking","This software can recognize voiced speech, but it takes several hours to configure it so that it doesn't make lots of mistakes.For a person who has Arthritis of Carpel Tunnel this is a great program, but they likely will need to voice out commmands for several hours to ready the program for near errorless preformance."
1,The software update policy ...,"This is not a review for this version, but a comment on IBM's update policy. I have an earlier version of ViaVoice, namely the Millenium Pro version, which I previously wrote a positive review about. However, if I want to update to the newest version I have to pay full price, since IBM only allows users who bought the previous version within a narrow, specified time period to get the upgrade price. Everyone else has to pay full price!Not even Microsoft who has often, deserved or undeserved, been called predatory, has to my knowledge never had such a restrictive software upgrade policy towards end-users.This is outrageous, and it certainly makes me want to look for alternatives!"
3,Via Voice,Via Voice works on my Pentium 4 XP operating system.It recognizes a large percentage of my speaking BUT not all and makes some amazing mistakes. It may get better with more training. It is not yet working well enough to use for full time work BUT works very well when my carpel tunnel kicks in. The computer responses well to my spoken commands. Not as quick as the mouse but when you can not move the mouse without pain it is the only way to get work done.
1,author is a thief,"The senior author of this book, ""Lorraine E. Hale, Ph.D."" former director Hale House Center, Inc. pled guilty to stealing contributions from Hale House. She and her husband stole over a million dollars of donations that were intended to help the children of drug-addicted or imprisoned women."
4,Good matching game for kids,"Sequence for Kids is a matching game using animal playing cards. The objective is to form a row of 4 chips of your color by playing a card, and placing a chip on the board on any of the matching animal squares.The strategic element is quite good. I think the older kid will be able to appreciate the strategy. My young kids just play them as a matching game for now. I let them playing with cards facing up to be more aware of what is happening on the board."
5,Easy Kids Game,This is an easy and fun game for the little ones. We enjoy playing it with the grand kids.
5,"Easy, fun, and quick to play","My mom bought this game for my son last year for Christmas. He was 4 at the time. For a year now, this game has been played at least once daily. Unlike Candyland and Chutes and Ladders, I am not sick of it yet. It is fun and you can play a game in about 5-10 minutes. My son has learned a lot of strategy from this, and used it on more advanced games as well. He is now playing adult sequence too, but we still love to come back to this version."
4,"After Candyland is old, try Sequence for Kids!","My 5 year old grandson and I are tired of Candyland and our version of Junior Monopoly, so we picked out this game and enjoyed it very much--the strategy was somewhat lost on my grandson, but that is good, because as he figures it out we will enjoy the game for months to come instead of becoming bored with the game too soon!"
4,Great for kids!,"My brother and I love to play this game. I am 7 and he is 4. It's an awesome game to play. It's so good I could play everyday. Ages 6-8 are perfect for this game, ages 4-5 will need a little help at first, then they just might beat you! We bought this game for my cousin Tori's 4th birthday and she loves it. She can beat her sisters- ages 7-10. A great game for the whole family to play."
5,lots of fun- I even ask the kids to play with me!,I love this game. I ask the kids to play with me sometimes b/c of all the kid games we have this is the one I enjoy best. They have started to learn strategy & planning ahead while we play.
4,Great for rainy days,"My children have enjoyed playing this board game for several years now. It has held up well. It is easy enough to play that children over a wide range of ages can play together. Great for family nights, too."
4,Great game board,"I play this game board maybe 5 times a day with my 6years old son during summer holiday. He likes it very much..simple and easy instruction, also he can learn to read from the cards as well. A good gift for your children."
4,Sequence for Kids,"Very good game, I have the adult version and thought the kids one sounded good for my niece and nephew and they love it."
5,Great step-up from toddler games,"We were very sick of Candyland by the time that we purchased this game. My 5 year old has some difficulty figuring out how to win and strategize to block us as she plays, but it is a good introduction to game strategy. It's a really fun game, and we can stand repeated playings of the game."
4,Games with granny,"I bought this game for my 4-year-old grandson. It is not challenging enough for him, although we happily played it and had a fun time. However, he was much more taken with Junior Monopoly (which requires an adult to do the reading until he memorizes the cards). The Sequence game is really just another version of a Bingo/Tic Tac Toe-type game and he has at least one other game like that. For kids that are into games, though, I would say this is a decent choice. The learning is simply in figuring out a winning strategy; there is no content learning as the animals on the playing cards are ones that probably most 3-year-olds already know. One advantage of this game is that it is short, so if you have a small window of time to play a game, it's a good choice (versus Monopoly, which is great for a long rainy afternoon)."
2,Too challenging for my 4 year old,"Tic tac toe would be a good start for a 4 year old. This game is too challenging for that age. I grew up playing board games and want my daughter to have that experience. So, I got this game for her since it has so many great reviews. The game is too challenging for her and it totally discouraged her from playing any board game! She concluded that all board games are tough to play. The recommended age is not right.I would look for more fun games that she can play with lot of people, something a little bit less challenging, creative - something like Pictionary Jr or story cubes."
4,Best Family Game to Include Youngers,"This game is simple enough to engage the kids yet challenging enough that the parents love it, too! I think the age suggestion is a little off, I would put it as best for 5 or 6 and up. The strategy is a little tough for our 5-year-old but he loves being a team with Dad. Another plus is that it is quick to play so we can do a quick game before bed or play it again and again when we have the time. We love it as one of the few young-kids games that doesn't bore the adults to tears."
5,"Fun over and over, and great for learning strategy","We got this for our daughter's 4th birthday and it was a hit from the first time we played it. She grasped the rules right away, even the special Unicorn and Dragon cards, but is still getting the hang of the strategy of blocking another player's actions - of course we don't expect her to learn that for awhile. Looking forward to trying other versions of Sequence."
5,as much fun as the adult version,"I played the adult sequence last christmas at my parents home. my husband and I had a good time losing to my parents. found this little kid version on amazon and thought it would be fun for my young kids(13,5,5,3). It is a little too much for the 3 yr old, he tries but I help him most times. The twins have picked it up pretty much in a week with a little help from me once in a while. we have been playing it every evening for a couple hrs. Yes they enjoy it that much. this one has animals for you to get your 4 in a row, I see there are also number or letter versions. worth every dollar and it keeps them from wanting to watch tv at night!"
3,Beyond Skin Care,"This is a really light oil, but I don't use this on my skin. The Grapeseed oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils."
3,Im content,"I originally bought this item in hopes that it would add a scent to my organic hair spray which is just a mix of essential oils and fresh bottled water, but to no avail. i suppose it serves its purpose as an added nutrient to my mixture but i was really hoping for the smell. but all in all good for conditioning and moisturizing. :)"
3,Okay,"I ordered this and expected something amazing, but it's only okay. Haven't tried it on my hair yet though, so we'll see."
5,A divot tool to replace all those ones I have lost.....,"Every golfer has lost many divot tools. From the cheap plastic ones that break soon after the pro shop basket is empty to the more expensive steel ones that attach to a golfer's hat or pants pocket. This one is great.The Victorinox Swiss Army Golf tool is made by the same people who make the multi purpose Swiss army knives and wristwatches. It contains a ball marker, a push buttom activated divot tool, scissors, a pen blade, and a bottle cap tool. The device is well made, slightly heavy (you know it is in your pocket) and also comes with a swivel clip and velcro nylon case to attach to a belt loop. Three Callaway HX Tour balls sweetened the deal."
2,"Flimsy Holder, Poor Design Attributes","The nylon-threaded holder rips easily. Ball marker held insecurely - lost marker after one round. Use of metal to clean iron groove is unthinkable - it would just scratch the club face.Now used as a $30, glorified ball-mark repairer.Disappointed because I have been a big fan of Victorinox. I would have designed it this way:- magnetic to hold 2 metal ball markers (disposable);- couple of holes to hold generic tees (disposable);- small nylon brush to clean grooves;- keep ball-mark repairer as-is.A way to monogram balls will be a plus."
5,Great deal!,"I've lost all my balls, but the tool by itself was worth the price of the product. It makes a great gift too!"
5,Survival gear for a good walk ruined.,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father, figuring it's one of those things that is nice to have but he would never buy for himself even as an avid golfer. As someone who does cycling--another expensive sport--I know I certainly tend to spend my money on the necessities, the nicest I can afford, and just forget about anything extra most of the time, so I thought this is one of those extras for golf, since I've never seen one who had one the few times I've played.In any case, he loves it and uses it. It's a nifty thing to have.I wrote on the card, ""To Dad: Survival gear for a good walk ruined."" Since I [...]Mark Twain with that note, I pass on the right to you, dear reader of Amazon reviews.Simple gifts are the best, and very few gifts can be as thoughtful, good, and yet cheap as this one."
2,Not what I expected,"Was extremely disappointed with the product, for that price, not what I thought it would be. cheazy box, tool was small and the black case was a dumb idea. Bought it as a Christmas gift, was too embarrassed to even give it to anyone. Returned it."
5,Impressive set,"Impressed with overall great quality of this set. Came in a very nice box, perfect for gift for the golf enthusiast"
4,great golf multi-tool,"very versatile tool for the golf course, divot tool, ball marker,all in one...i highly recommend this for the new or experienced golfer."
4,Pleased with product,"I purchased the Golf Tool as a gift for my son, he is very happy with it, the fact that it came as a set with the golf balls was a bonus! He is really looking forward to the spring. As for me, dealing with Amazon has always been a pleasure, accurate forcasting of shipping info and consistently meeting or exceeding expectations!"
3,OK....BUT....,"One reviewer said it, aimed to graphic designers but can help web developers.It is OK, the book is mostly examples of colors and text. Can be used as a reference book but I wouldn't say I learned anything new or gained anything from this book."
4,They always miss a gem!,"It's a ""crying shame"" that ""Cry On My Shoulder"" is not on here, a song that showcases Bonnie's beautiful voice far more than several that were included."
5,"POWERFUL AND A SING-ALONG, TOO","This is a wonderful compilation of the songs that make Bonnie great! Not only was I compelled to sing along with the most popular songs that I ""knew"" already, the ones that I did not know were so ""real"" that I just had to really listen to the words and the feelings that Bonnie so masterfully poured into every performance... and whadda ya know, after a couple of listenings I was humming those too! Tapping my feet, bobbing my head. She's just so ""real"" and the honesty comes through so that anybody can relate..and that, my firends, is what really makes Bonnie Raitt great!"
4,If you think the software works well....,"You should try using it with the CardScan 600C scanner. I used to own the 500 model scanner, but when they created this color scanning device-I had to have it. Not only did the OCR improve from the previous version, it is now a USB only scanner, that's much sleaker and smaller than it's predecessor. I scan, and with the click of a button (after the setup of course) I can send all the information into my Outlook Contacts folder, or my Palm Pilot address book. This thing is great, where has it been all my life, now to attack the huge pile of business cards that I have sitting around my desk!"
2,ugly,does the job although unsightly and has provided a sturdy base for the umbrella which is permenantly up and will not retract during evenings or breeze.
1,This umbrella stand was missing a critical part to make it function. Therefore it is useless,This umbrella stand was missing a very important piece- therefore it is useless. I would not recommend this umbrella stand at all.
4,Base for offset umbrella,Wouldn't have the offset umbrella without this base - works great! I put a little bleach in the water to prevent any bacteria or mold.
3,Could be a bit more functional,"Once filled with water, plan on leaving it in place. There's no low-position drain plug, so your only option is to move it full (ugh, even with wheels it's a bear to move) or open the fill cap and flip the unit 180 degrees then rock the thing in your hands once most of the water is gone to get the last gallon or so out. Also, for $60 the wheels gould be a bit heftier."
3,"Worked, but is a huge ugly monstrosity","This product works as described, however, it is alot larger than it looks in the picture. It is very ugly! And for the price why buy something so unattractive for your patio area. I suggest getting the triangle shaped umbrella weights instead. We found some and they work perfectly and are low to the ground and fit in much nicer with any patio decor."
4,UMRELLA BASE,"First, the service from Amazon was great. The base is large enough to support my 12 foot diameter umbrella in any position, using water vs sand. Very happy about that. Don't attempt to move the stand around when it is full. the construction is not as sturdy as a free standing basketball base and damage will most likely occur. Plenty sturdy to move when half full. Really only important for initial umbrella placement. Would have gotten a fifth star if construction was heavier gage and more color choices were available."
2,Breakable !,"Filled this unit with water and it worked OK for a while. Moved a couple of times and the unit cracked. Had to fill with sand to keep it functional. The unit has wheels, but once it is full it is very heavy and difficult to move. ( I guess that makes sense ) May be better just getting 4 large paver stones."
3,It's better than nothing I guess...,"Filled the base with water and it works fine if the winds aren't that strong...so, my advice is, don't leave umbrella left open unattended. If a strong gust of wind comes rolling in, umbrella will tip over...mine did. Frame bent and lucky for me I was able to bend it back.Lesson learned...don't leave umbrella open unattended even with the weighted base."
1,Leaks!!!!,"I just set this up with my new umbrella and I was very disappointed to see that it leaks! I can only fill it up to the seam. I don't know if that is going to make it heavy enough to hold up the umbrella in the wind. I'm very disappointed. It is very large and ugly and takes up a whole corner of my patio, but the umbrella won't stay up without it. I guess I can try filling it with sand, but that's going to make it almost impossible to move if I want to take it down to the back yard."
1,Cheap and broke after 2 days,"We filled the base with water as instructed and it held our umbrella really well. On the second day we noticed the plastic was warping, like it was melting in the heat, except we live in Denver and it doesn't get that hot. We took the valve off thinking it was building pressure inside...but that didn't work. Still warped and ugly looking, like someone stood on in and smashed it in. We decided to move it in the shade and see if would regain it's shape. But no, it popped a seam and water gushed everywhere. Product sucks."
2,Over-Rated,"I ordered this product simultaneously with my offset umbrella and, based upon the enthusiasm of reviews I read, felt more confident in this part of the purchase then in the umbrella itself.Yes, it works, but then so would a few bags of sand or several pavers, or just about anything else that is heavy that you could lay on top of the base...and none of these other solutions would be any less attractive or take up more space on your patio. All of them would be considerably cheaper too.One should understand upfront what you are buying with this: a large and very unsightly white molded plastic reservoir. A pretty cheap looking piece of plastic for about $75. This should cost less than $20 for what it actually is."
3,back yard shade,"Finally used this umbrella this year and the base worked out fine. The only thing is that it's quite large and since my back yard is tiny, it takes up a lot of room. Other than that, worked out well!"
5,umbrella,"bought it to hold down my off set umbrella, fill with water or sand, filled mine with water and didnt do the greatest job"
3,great but leaks,Base leaks. Small leak but disappointing. Drained and used pool to find leaks but unsuccessful. Suggestions to seal?? small leak but created water on deck and I had added a little bleach.
2,Disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed with this base. The function is perfect, but the seams are already leaking water after only 1 week."
3,Practical but too big and ugly for my deck....,"I bought this but didn't think about the size too much....it is huge! I think the photos misled me because to me it looks better in the pictures than in real life.I'm sure it does a great job, and might look ok by a pool...but my deck and furniture is all wood and this huge white plastic container looks really out of place. I will be returning it to try a different option. Husband hated it too, even though he admits it's probably good at its job.I did buy the Southern Patio offset umbrella which is great."
3,Umbrella base,"Initially, it appeared to work well. Shortly afterwards, the water filled plastic shell started to collapse. It's awkward and takes away from the beauty of the umbrella."
2,White monster,"This weight may work well or may not - I will never know because I could not accept this blob of white plastic in my mediterranean patio. It would not be so bad if you can somehow cover it with plants or if your patio setup is such that a huge white thing in it does not become an eyesore.BTW, regardless of its actual size this thing really looks enormous. Huge. Gigantic. Humangous. We will be using other methods, I had to return this item."
1,Big Big Big,"I was disappointed to open the box and find that 1) it was white. No where in the description did it state this is a white base nor was there a color selection. The picture [at the time of my purchase] appeared to be a light tan shade. The box indicates that this base is available in the tan, white or hunter green. 2) This base is HUGE! 3) It had ugly molded handles that are not shown in the picture.Back to the size, I was planning on placing my offset umbrella behind an Adirondack chair and have the chair sort of hide the base. But there is no way! This base is not only gigantic, it's thick and cannot be hidden except for under a table. Very disappointed."
4,Southern Patio Offset Umbrella Base,"Well, the umbrella is not going ANYWHERE with this base filled! It's huge! And when filled with water, you will need at least one other person to help lift and move/roll this sucker (and a third to hold the umbrella so it won't fall over).It functions absolutely as described. But be very aware of the space requirements and its imposing presence. Measure your area carefully."
3,Southern Patio Blowmolded Base For Offset Umbrella,"A clever, well designed, very ugly, necessary evil for an off-set umbrella. I have to take some time to paint a garden on it!! :-)"
3,"Some problems, very solid","Mine leaks water. It took an hour to fix with some plumbing-seal tape. I'd suggest better manufacture quality control and maybe a baffle inside that would help support the top because setting anything on it (a plant or your three year old) results in a permanent ""dent."" The gardener will cut this with the weedeater, I'm certain. It is ugly, and I'm wondering if maybe I can cover it with a table or chair. I'm not terribly happy with the design, but it does work well to anchor the umbrella."
3,Umbrella Base,"This product certainly does what it says it will. It needs to be filled with sand or water to give it the weight to support the umbrella. I used water so that I could easily de-commission it over the winter. It is a bit cumbersome, but it works well. For the price and functionality, I would buy it again."
4,Very good product,We hve used this product for years and believe it is performing as advertising indicates. We have recommended Super Thrive to others.
4,Superthrive fertilizer,"I'm only in the early stages of using this product, but have heard many good testimonials about it. It is easy to use and reasonably affordable. I've been using it for about six months on newly-planted trees, and it appears to be doing its job. A better read will be about a year from now, once the trees have gone through all seasons."
1,unhappy,"Finally I got a response on how to reach you.I ordered and recieved this product on the right, about one month ago.'The shipment itself came in good time but my goods were damaged.The bowls have a large damaged black banged spot on the side of the bowlsand the package waswrecked. the trays were fine .I sent an e-mail way back when I recoved the goodsbut not sure where it ened up because I did not get a treply.I am sure these goods were sent to me damaged already, they never goodsdamaged in the shipment ;ole that. I am totaly disappointed and eventhough I have the set simple lines I will never order from amazon againGERALDINE MICHALCHUKVERY VERY UNHAPPY\"
2,cool,"Cool look - useful for storage, not Dishwasher safe. I only use for dry items such as chips - peanuts etc. Love the style, but limited use."
2,They are enamel over metal,NO WHERE DOES IT SAY METAL.. IF IT HAD I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED IT..CANT PUT IN DISH WASHER ..THEY NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE ORDERING..
5,work well!,use these with my matching dishes as serving and storage pieces; sturdy; the only drawback is that they cannot go in the microwave – but I knew this before I bought them!
4,Okay For A Start,There are very few beginning Chinese language videos for kids available so I am grateful for everything I can find. This was the first Chinese language video I purchased and it's okay for a start. There is no accompanying booklet or printed words to follow along so you'll have to listen very closely to get the pronounciation corect. Some cute songs and exercises. The production quality is okay - not as slick as other kids' videos.
4,Pretty good,"At first my daughter (adopted from China) wasn't too interested in this video, but recently (at age 3) has been asking to watch it repeatedly. She has already learned to count to 10 in Chinese (with proper intonation). It's not the most exciting video to watch, but I'm impressed with the results so far."
2,not for serious programmers,"The code presented in this book is painful to look at. For one thing, the author is not familiar with basic Java coding conventions and continues to use C conventions instead.In addition to not knowing proper coding conventions, this guy has no clue about writing Java UIs - the code listed in this book actually has Visual Cafe tags all over the place!As far as info regarding spiders/bots/aggregators - there is decent high level overview info in this book, but nothing for a real programmer. You will not learn how to build these things on your own, and the book relies on the helper libraries included on the cd-rom to accomplish anything. If you are hoping to build anything useful after purchasing this book, understand that you will only succeed if you include the com.heaton.* libraries included on the cd."
5,happy,"Visual Cafe produces the Swing so one can view the examples from the book. So what?When beginning to program with HTTP protocols, it's easy to enter incorrect methods and parameters that lead to dead-ends and frustration. As I learn about and use the Heaton API, I am pleasantly surprised with the methods available and how easily they're implemented and that they lead to success.The source code is included on the CD with updated versions at the Heaton Website."
2,very limited usefulness,"This book is primarily a users guide for the libraries provided on the cd-rom. If you are looking for the information necessary to write spiders, bots and aggregators by hand, then this is not a very good book to use.The source code is included for the libraries on the cd-rom, but the authors java skills are very weak which makes the code difficult to interpret."
3,Translated short stories of Rabindranath Tagore,"Thanks to Amazon for making this translation available for free. This is a review of the quality of the translation - not the literary merit, or otherwise, of the original Bengali language book. Generally the translators did a good job except for a few typos and occasions when they took liberties with some of the names.I got this book to introduce my 12y. old daughter to the works of Rabindranath Tagore (Thakur as he should be known). This collection of short stories serves that purpose reasonably well."
2,Be prepared to buy a new one every year,I have bought two of these and each of them has lasted about a year. Sound quality when connecting my iPod to the Aux input on my car stereo is fine initially but after about 12 months both cables have lost output to one of the channels. Seems to me that the one thing a flexible cable should be able to do is flex without breaking! I will be buying the next cable from another supplier.
2,Very nice cable but stops working after a year or so,"I liked the slim chrome design and the sturdy look. But after about a year of light use, the cable started working intermittently. While Belkin is a good company in general, I do not recommend this product."
4,Fast and accurate!!,I was impressed on how easy this software sets up!Within an hour of training it with my voice it got very accurate. However there are some words it had difficulty to get them at first. You have to keep correcting it within the first days so it can be well trained. Great product!
1,Biggest Bomber of the Century..!!!,"Avoid this movie...!!! It is so BAD as to defy description. I couldn't tell which was worse....the script, the direction, the actors, or the props.......taken as a whole it is less than a ""0"" film.....best thing to do with this DVD is to use it as a frisbee or for target practice..!!"
4,Fishman Matrix NT1 Guitar Pickup - review,"So far I did not have any problems with it. I had it installed by a professional, charged me $30 and I was very pleased with the work.The downside of this pickup is that it does not come with volume control and the biggest one is the lack of bass. I own a Big Baby Taylor and I was hoping to gain some bass sound when amplified with this pick-up but that has not happened. Besides that it sounds good."
1,Worked for 15 minutes,"Do not buy this product!I was extremely excited to get the so-called ""Ipod-buster"" in the form of the Meizu M6--it supposedly is the ""next big thing.""Unfortunately, it only worked after playing 10 seconds of a song!! This situation was further aggrivated by the fact that the manual clearly was written by someone with a paltry understanding of English (they misspelled ""internet"" for goodness sake!). Additionally, the Meizu website is awful, with English that is not understandible--and their customer service number is in China!All told, I made the mistake of spending good money to avoid the big dogs of the mp3 player world. My next mp3 player purchase: from Apple."
1,Excruciating examination of minutiae,"I kept waiting for the author to get to the point about something. Was it a happy childhood, an unhappy one? Is she a happy adult? Did she have some childhood trauma? Whatever happened to her mother to make her so unhappy in the end? This book was a hodge podge of fleeting images, parenthetical descriptions about nothing important, a memory here and there - what was the story? We all have flashes of childhood memories, but they aren't that interesting to anyone else. Yet this author jumps from one memory to another, in excruciating detail, as if every memory she can pull out and examine is interesting to the world at large. Don't waste your time."
1,"Awful, absolutely awful","This book is absolutely awful. It's full of ad hominem remarks and plays to the emotion of women being in prision. Why are most people (not just women) in prison there? Because they commited a crime!!! The author blames men for most of these women's crimes throughout the book - they were abused at a young age by men, they were poor . . . excuses. When will people take responsibility for their actions? The book has some beautiful photography - they should have taken the ink used for the text and put in some more pictures. Don't buy it, don't read it. I'm sorry I wasted my time."
3,"pictures from ""the day our world changed""","very moving and inspiring art-however i was looking for a particular picture. the drawing of Jesus standing over the twin towers and accepting the souls from same towers into heaven. this drawing was supposed to have been drawn by an elementary student and was printed in the editorial section of our local paper after 911. I had this posted on my bus every year since-this year my bus caught fire and i lost my only copy. i was hoping to find this picture in the book, but it was not there. enjoyed the book, nonetheless."
1,HUH,"I was clearly confused when I ordered these dice. 5 units = 5 dice. I had a different definition of unit in my mind, so I was surprised when I got 5 dice in bubble wrap. So, I bought 5 dice for $2 (plus S&H). Duh. At least I didn't pay the list price of $9.99 or I'd feel REALLY stupid."
2,Decent at best,I ordered 35 dice and only one has no flaw. Others have minor or major flaws. The dices range from decent qualities to low qualities. Some even have cracks and the dot colors are off. Will not order from the seller again.
2,NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ORNAMENT!,I DID NOT LIKE THIS ORNAMENT! IT IS TOO HEAVY FOR MY LARGE 9 FT TREE - HANG UNEVENLY ON THE TREE AND LOOKS POORLY MADE.
2,CAREFUL!!!! His opinons are carefully mixed in.,"This book has one serious flaw. It is this man's opinon. He is not a prophet. His authority is ""20 years of teaching sunday school"". Some of his assertions border on fantasy. The true test of this man's opinons is found in the scripture, where the prophets say that the way to know if a man is a true prophet is if the things he says come to pass. We DO need to be prepared but Mr. Young instills a false sense of hysteria and paranoia. He uses many scriptures, but in the end Mr. Young merely speculates on them. Probably the most true part of this book is his discussion of a prophecy by George Albert Smith. We should listen to the prophets and heed their counsels, especially if they go against what Mr. Young has here stated in his book. Be prepared, but not paranoid!"
5,"Thanks, Roger, for shaing everything you've learned...","This book, in conjunction with the others in the series, provides significant insight into the expected events of the last days before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Everything Roger outlines in his books is entirely based on scripture and the words of the prophets. When he deviates from the written word of god, he is very clear to state the he is doing so and invites the reader to make his or her own judgements. I am thankful that my family and I have been blessed with this material. It has helped us prepare more thoroughly, for possible future events, than we otherwise would have. Rogers' books are the culmination of about ten years of personal research and study. I know that I don't now, nor will I ever, have that kind of time to invest in this sort of research. Without Rogers' books, I never would have known so well what is to come. Thanks, Roger!"
5,A real eye opener to current events!,Finally the prophecys from Daniel to Revelations make sence. I was totally AMAZED that the Gulf War and Chernobyl were possible fulfillments of these prophecies. I took part in the Gulf War and didn't know that I was fulfilling Bible prophecy. This book really brought it close to home for me. I have read the book several times and I am constantly telling other people about it. It has changed my outlook on life.
5,"A Wonderful boost, solid item!","Quickly said - it provides noticeable improvement for gaming on an old AGP system, it's stable, and I recommend it.More details:This video card is the absolute best my old system can handle. It is a wonderful way to extend your old gaming rig that has AGP (4x) like mine. I bought this GeForce to replace a Radeon 9500 Pro that fried.My computer had a 1.5Ghz processor, and my gaming benchmarks rocketed up almost 50% with this card over the old Radeon; even with a low end processor. Now that I've recently upgraded my processor to the best it can handle, 2.8GHz, the card is no longer bottlenecked. I can play games like Doom 3 with high settings fluidly thanks to this card. I could not be happier with its performance.It doesn't overheat, and if you're wondering - it can work on AGP 2.0 because the pins and voltages are the same. The card is very stable, and as mentioned - performs well. I highly recommend this card if you're looking to upgrade your AGP system."
2,"By the London Pops, not the original artists!","I am searching for a copy of ""High Hopes"" by Frank Sinatra, and when I saw this CD I thought I had it. Nope. It is the London Pops performing a bunch of Academy Award Winners, it is bland, it has none of the special quality of the original songs by the original performers. If you like Pops renditions of popular tunes this may be for you; otherwise search elsewhere."
3,"? nice title, what's it about?","Amazon does not get the point. Manny of the books would sell if we had an idea as to what the books are about! If we are lucky, someone who has read it, will wright about it, letting us know about the book! Can't tell if we are going to wanet to buy it if we only see the cover! :-\"
4,As I expected,I like the book a lot and it got here within the window I was given. To bad my professor hasn't had us use it at all yet!
2,Not quite,"It isn't as sticky as I wanted, doesn't hold that great... Tried to screw it into the door- but couldn't. Wound up super taping it to the door, still doesn't quite work. Not really that thrilled. It was cheap."
2,Adhesive not strong enough - comes unstuck from door.,"I cleaned and dried my door as expected. At first the product worked fine, but after about 2 weeks, the adhesive wore off and the sweep detached from the door. Unless you plan on using additional adhesive or fasteners, don't bother with this product."
1,Disappointed in this vendor,"Vendor advertised a set of (12), then refused to sell them to me. Sent one bit instead. I complained. First they said the price was for (1). Then agreed the listing was in error. The price got changed. So they refunded my money. If they are so cheap that they would do this on a nickle-dime purchase, how can you trust them on larger orders? No credibility. This is the kind of vendor that gives Amazon a black eye and should be banned."
2,Too tight,I thought mild compression was mild but this was not to mild for a sensitive foot with swelling. My feet swelled below ankle so it made my one day to wear miserable. Be aware of mild compression and no compression if you are diabetic.Ask your doector what his recommend for you is first. The foot part had no compression just the top.
1,Wear out very quickly,"These socks are comfortable but they wear out far too quickly. I ordered them twice -- a couple of pair each time. With the first order each pair wore holes in the heel after/during the third wearing (both socks!). I figured that maybe I received a bad batch so I ordered two more pairs. Same thing -- after the third wearing of one pair and the fourth wearing of the other pair they had to be discarded.So, 1 star for ""poor wear"" and ""poor value"" since the average cost per wearing is so high!"
2,Not the greatest,"These are nice, warm socks, but I don't feel any support whatsoever. I'll put my money into true compression socks instead."
2,compression socks,"These are so hot I can hardly stand to wear them. Also when I DO wear them I come home with swelling above the top of the socks. Just no good for being on your feet all day. I do think they are softer, so I see where they could be better for diabetics---in the winter!"
5,great for people who stand for long periods of time,"I bought a couple pairs for work (I'm a nurse and work 12 hr shifts) about 6 months ago and they are great! I just got on here to buy a few more pairs. Not too tight (they don't dig into your leg at the top), but perfectly tight enough. They actually stay up, instead of sliding down your leg, like other brands I have tried in the past. Also- they are super soft. And thick -which is great if you wear hard sole clogs (like Dansko) like I do. They look like they'd make you hot, but I haven't found that to be the case. Compression socks are a must-have when you're standing for 12 hrs straight - they make your legs feel muuuuch better. Love em!"
3,Cost Effective,For the price it worked well but it is a good starter for someone who is trying this product for the first time
3,Charming Little Bracelet,"I was in the market for a little thicker bracelet and was trying to match this item with a particular ring, but if not for these two criteria, I would definitely have kept this item to add to my jewelry collection. The small stones were a beautiful (Swiss?) blue topaz color, and were beautifully enhanced by the gold. Easy to wear and a piece of jewelry that could be dressed up or down. Also thought the piece was a good value for the money."
4,Great Product,Just purchased a second one for the other car. 15 seconds to switch ball sizes vice having to switch drawbars or changes the shanks is invaluable. Sturdy item - highly recommend. Just make sure you know which size shank to order for your drawbar.
1,Unusable Product,This product is a total disaster. The ratio of correctly translated words to words the software misinterprets is roughly 8:1 at best. In my estimation it is unusable. Stay away!
5,Zenostim was Effective,I purchased Zenostim because i was very scared of all the issues with ephedra and caffeine and really wanted a good stimulant free diet pill. I came across Zenostim after extensively researching products like Provactin and Xenadrine Efx. I have been taking it for over a week now and i think it is working very well. I do not have any problems with jitters or heart palpitations that i was gettign with the stimulant products. I like Zenostim and will see what it will do for me!
5,Great product,"Really is a great buy, great price and quality is great, the car charger is a nice addition, this company really make my day."
2,Too Small for a Pocket Watch,"I bought this watch for my husband when his expensive pocket watch broke. It is too small for his liking, and it does not keep time well."
4,pocket watch,This is a good quality watch for the price. Easy to read watch face and second hand. Good to have at times when a wristwatch is in the way for household projects.
5,Good Filter,"Filter does exactly as it should. Being a smoker, it sure helps filter the smoke from the room with little to no residue smoke or oder in the air"
5,one true passionate,a wonderful collection of pieces by revenge - or a new order new order - gets better with the passing of time and listening - highly recommended - purchased from Darla records - fantastic service
4,Fun model building set,"I am an ""older kid"" who put this set together with my 5-year old. Overall, it is a good building set. There are extra pieces included, which is always good. The instructions are easy to follow, but the poor contrast and smallness of the illustrations may make it difficult for youngsters. The model holds well together, but one must be careful of the wings, blades, and other parts that are supposed to be ""loose"". The colors and overall appearance are great. This model is a great project for kids (young and old) to build. It looks so good that I don't want to take it apart to try the other suggested projects. It would be better, however, if the kit contained all the necessary pieces to build the other suggested projects."
2,Missing Pieces,We were sad to see that this was the second toy from Mega Bloks that did not come with all the pieces. It was challenging until we discovered that pieces were missing from this model as well as the first we purchased.
3,Great buy for the price,"Nice comforter. I got this as a replacement for my son's Sponge Bob comforter which I gave away as I felt he had grown beyond that stage. It turned out that he loves this one just as much.The background color is more of an aquamarine and it is very mild. It is a fantastic commforter and the best part is the price at amazon is great. I bought him the DVD at amazon as well and he enjoys looking at the movie all tucked under his comforter.The design is nice for older children who are not teens yet but, I think smaller kids might be frightened by the image."
3,"At the clearance price ($16.52 for the Twin), it's quite reasonable","I purchased the comforter on clearance. I need spare comforters for my labrador retriever to sleep on. It is not the softest material, but well-padded. I could hardly fit the twin comforter in my extra-large washing machine. It's warm enough and will do its job. There's nothing luxurious about it, but it will do. These are currently the cheapest comforters available through Amazon.com."
5,Remastering is Clean and Vibrant!,"I'm not sure if it's the 66 hits, the incredible variety and scope of the music, or the fresh remastering of these wonderful songs which make them sound like they were recorded in 2006! The sequencing is great; the songs are grouped into types so if I feel like hearing movie songs I put that CD in; if i need inspiration I put that CD in. It's like having 5 of his best albums!"
4,An endless source of wonderment,"I'm still overwhelmed by the scope and depth of this atlas. Every page contains beautiful images and maps that could take your breath away.....it would have been nice to have included some basic information or supplementary information -- basically, you get maps, take it or leave it. Sometimes I have trouble figuring out the projection method since they are taken from different slices for different maps. I'm still a beginner, so in some ways this atlas is daunting, but I know when I'm at a real dark sky site, this atlas will provide years of enjoyment. A worthwhile investment."
5,Serious,"For a serious, accurate map of the night sky this is it. The unlaminated version could be a problem if you are battling dew."
4,Great companion for the small to medium sized telescope,"Wil Tirion is one of the big names in celestial chart making, and this Atlas makes it easy to see why. With stars plotted down to 8th magnitude and just about every deep sky object withing the grasp of a typical amateur telescope, the Sky Atlas will get you through years of deep-sky observing. However, if you have a large telescope (greater than 12 inches or so) or are a more seasoned amateur, you might want to invest in the more detailed Uranometria 2000. Sky Atlas 2000 comes with a clear plastic grid overlay for getting exact coordinates (I wish it were made out of a more durable plastic - mine has grown heavily scotch taped with use). I would recommend coating the pages of the altas with a waterproof map sealant (sold in marine and backpacking stores). Otherwise, frequent soakings by dew will hasten wear and tear on the charts."
5,Using The Mueller Technique With The Sky Atlas 2000.0 Deluxe,"Sky Map 2000 Deluxe is beautifuly done and an awesome resource. I have a technique to save my Sky Map from abuse in the field. To get the most out of your Sky Atlas, scan in those sections of the Sky Map that contain the objects you are looking for, onto your computer. You can print out the scans and take them into the field at night to hunt down those faint fuzzies. You can even use a graphics program to create white stars on a black background, blow up areas, and type in notes onto the scans. You don't need the whole Sky Map out in the field with you. This will save wear and tear on your Sky Map 2000 Deluxe.jim mueller"
2,Black is White,"Previous copies of this atlas which I have purchased were printed with white stars on a black field. Unfortunately,this copy I bought from Amazon was the reverse, ""black stars"" on a white field, a whole different visual experience. Too bad."
2,1996 town and country chilton manual,"This manual is terrible.There are no labels on the junction box under the steering column , The manual is so vague that it is very hard to find what your looking for and The electrical part is terrible. I am going to by a Hanes now so I can get the things repaired that I need!!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book to discover funding ideas for a business I was interested in starting. Unfortunately, I did not find the information I was looking for.This book is not without merit, but it is not the information source its publishers advertise it to be. There is information for civic groups, minorities, economically challenged people, etc. However, there was not very much information for middle class Americans. I felt it would have been more honest to title the book ""Government Funding Sources for Minorities, Economically disadvantaged, and State Goverments.""My advice would be to check it out at your public library first. If you find it useful, then buy it. Otherwise, keep looking."
1,A waste of your money,This book did NOT provide any good information for real business people trying to get money for their business. Save your money by NOT buying this!
1,Not Worth It.,"Another complete waste of money and time. This book provided no good information for securing capital, other than small business loans. Mostly based on loans by states, of which only one applies at any given time. Another dust collector for my shelves."
5,Titles included are:,Pobre Pero HonradaCoyote EmplumadoNi de Aqui Ni de AllaLas Delicias Del PoderMaria Elena Velasco as La India Maria -- a beautiful comic genius!
5,Works great,"Couldn't be happier. We had a growing cricket problem in our laundry room. I put two of these out one night, they were full in the morning, and haven't seen a cricket since."
4,Eaton Cricket Glue Trap Works Well,"The glue traps are about 12 inches by 2 inches and come four to a box. They work well and do not get in the way of floor traffic, but they are open, very sticky, and definitely not child-friendly. You have know where the crickets are coming in and just set one or two in the path. Nothing much happens for two or three days, then one or two crickets appear, then more. After a couple of weeks after they start appearing, the traps stop accumulating crickets and it is time to replace them. Most useful in late summer and fall, when the crickets come indoors."
1,Not what you expect,"The product description says that they work with crawling insects. The design is similar to that of an ice cube tray with the glue in the bottom of the tray. The insects have to either hop into the tray or climb the side and then upside down over the overhang. They have not been effective for the crawling insects I was trying to catch.I would recommend using the Tomcat Glue Boards. They have worked well for my crawling insects.MOTOMCO LTD 32522 ""Tomcat"" LTD Style Glue Board 4/PK"
4,Spider Cricket,"Worked very well - try to place it where the little ""critters"" are located. I would buy it again ifthey return next year"
5,"Oh, it works all right","Crickets were invading my garage. I bought a set of four of these traps and placed them throughout the garage. See the photo I uploaded to see the result. Dozens of crickets were captured within 5 days, and I think that's about all of them now. Curiously, some traps were more ""popular"" than others -- probably due to their somewhat random placement being more in the path of crickets. But eventually all four caught quite a collection."
5,These totally work!,"Every year in late August to early September we have a horrible cricket problem in our house. They get in through the garage/laundry room and make their way up to the main level of the house. This year was exceptionally bad. It was not unusual to find 6 to 10 per day in my house and the chirping was driving us insane. I found all sorts of suggestions online, including insecticides, but none of them worked for me. Then I found these glue traps on Amazon. After reading all the good reviews I decided to give them a try. The day I placed the glue traps around my house ALL of the chirping stopped. They are amazing! I highly recommend them."
5,"Chilling Adventure Tale, as well a good ethics manual!","I played classical guitar in the background at 4 of McCord's booksignings in Green Bay last year. The personal stories he tells people who buy his book are even better than the book. And the book's good. Real good. McCord recommended I read ""Toxic Sludge is Good For You,"" which I still have to buy one of these days. Marco Capelli"
3,Not good for younger babies,"We ordered this for our four month old, because it said it was suitable for that age. But it is actually too big of a space to safely place a baby that young; we had to stuff blankets in all around him so he wouldnt flop and be injured. The sides were also pretty high and his arms didnt' fit over them, even though he is a normal size baby. I would recommend purchasing a more fitted jumper for a baby under one year old."
2,too difficult,"This jumper is too hard to get my baby in and out of. He grabs the straps and it's just a hassle to use. It also doesn't really ""bounce"". He has a jumperoo and has loved that since he was 4 months old. This on the other hand was a waste of money and a complete annoyance."
2,Save up and get the more expensive model...,"This is very cute - bright colors, adorable pattern etc. However, unless you are pumping it up and down with your hand, or your child weighs 35 pounds, it won't bounce smoothly. It's very jerky. I loved the price, however the only thing it was good for was a swing. Save up and buy a more expensive model, your child will have a lot more fun!"
2,gia's bouncer,"Is not what we had in mind, is very complicated, every time you get the baby in or out w/out bumping her face or neck, maybe is for older kids....my kid is 7 mo. and 21 pounds....she spends in the average of ten minutes."
2,Poorly built,"I just got it today, had my 5 month old daughter in it for 2 minutes and was disappointed. It is cheap and it isn't 'springy'. The straps are in an awkward place and they rub against her arms. She can't even barely jump in it because the spring sucks."
2,not ok for a big baby,"I purchased this for my daughter (12 months and 24 pounds) as she is not walking yet and thought it would be fun for her to have something to do while I cooked and washed the dishes. I did read the description and some reviews, but did not see anywhere that the limit was 24 lbs. There was a complaint that it was too big for one kid, so I thought ""great, baby will fit!""When it arrived, alas, the weight limit was 24 lbs. Just be aware! I had to return it immediately, like I had time for that!Frustrated Mom"
1,I HATE IT!,"My baby is 7 1/2 months old and she can barely fit in it! Her legs are spread too wide apart and she she moves from side to side and back and forth. She loves to jump, which is why I purchased the jumper, but I am highly disappointed in the johnny jump cause my baby fits inside it clearly very uncomfortable. It seems to be designed for a big or hefty baby, not an average size baby. I'm going to purchase her a different jumper so she can jump around all she wants! I would rather throw out the johnny jump than to let someone eles go through the horror!!!"
3,New mom of five month old baby,"This product is well made and a value for the cost. But the bucket seat is huge. I baught this for my daughter who was four months old at the time and weighed almost sixteen pounds and 25 inches. Her legs were spread wide making it difficult to jump, and her body slipped from one side of the seat to the other. I tried stuffing a blanket around her to keep in the middle, but she was never able to enjoy it. I since purchased a much smaller jumper that she enjoys now. I kept this jumper because I do like it and think she will enjoy it at about 8 to 10 months when she is a bigger baby, if she's not already walking by then."
2,I returned this for the version with the tray,"This seemed like the original johnny jump-up I had for my first child 13 years ago. We loved that one, so I got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together, it didn't work very well. It just didn't seem as SPRINGY as it should be. I ended up returning it and getting the $40 version with the tray instead (the Jump & Go). People have complained about the tray pinching baby's fingers against the doorway, but we have a wide doorway, so it works well and is a lot springier. Also, our little guy likes the toy tray on the Jump & Go version a lot."
1,Johnny Dangle and Spin,"The spring was too tight so there is no ""jump"" in the Johnny Jump Up. My son just hung there pathetically. He bent his knees and just kind of swung. At 4 months, the basket was way too big for him, he could only get one arm over the bar, and the other was tucked inside because he couldn't reach the other side. He just chewed on the bar, and thats the most entertainment he got out of it. When he did try to jump, if only one of his feet touched the ground, it would spin out of control."
5,Very Fun,My daughter absolutely LOVED playing in this. She would jump in it until she was completely worn out. She would laugh and squeal the entire time she was in it. I would just sit and laugh at how excited she was when she was jumping around like a monkey in it. She couldn't get enough of jumping in the Johnny Jump up and was upset when she finally outgrew it(We finally had to invest in a large trampoline and net).
4,Up to 24 Pounds,"The packaging states that this baby item is for kids 4 months up to 24 pounds. I found that my great nephew was not ready for this jumper until he was six months old. I felt he needed much better head and neck control than what he possessed at four months.We started using this Johnny Jump Up when he was six months old and already nearing 20 pounds. So the window of use will be small - but for the price, it's worth it.We needed to play with the distance off the floor. It took us a little bit of adjusting up and down to get it right. If their toes only barely touch, they will only twirl and spin. If you set it too low they have a difficult time pushing off and bouncing.The spring is noisy, but it doesn't bother me or the baby too much.All in all a nice option to distract baby for a little while."
1,Not very springy,"I was so excited for my son to try this out, but what a disappointment. We call it the suzy spins a lot, it's not springy at all and when he pushes off his feet he just spins around; I've tried raising and lowering the height but he has never gotten the idea that he can bounce around. I WISH I could return it, as it is It's going in the garbage."
2,Worst jumper we tried,"Though pink and cute, this thing never seemed to work quite right. The baby wasn't stable in it -- she would flop over forward. Observers wondered if she would fall out. While that never happened, she'd get burn marks on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself. Ouch...An annoyance: I had to get help to clamp it into doorways; couldn't attach & detach it myself.It just didn't work for us.By way of comparison: our favorite jumper was the Graco Bumper Jumper. Still working very well for us. She bounces much more often and more happily in the Graco than she did in the Evenflo."
